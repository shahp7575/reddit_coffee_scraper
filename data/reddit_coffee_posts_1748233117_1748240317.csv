1kvncsk,https://i.redd.it/bykwemvyj23f1.jpeg,Daily habits to improve your animation timing,"
You ever spend 6 hours perfecting the ease-in of a bouncing ball...
Only to watch it and say,
“Nope. This ball has the timing of my dad trying TikTok.”

Act 1: Timing Isn’t a Skill — It’s a Lifestyle

Let’s be real. Good timing in animation doesn’t just happen.
It’s not like:
“Ah yes, I drank coffee this morning and suddenly my keyframes snapped into place like Pixar whispered in my ear.”

No.
You train your timing. Like a muscle. Like leg day. But for your eyeballs.


---

Act 2: Daily Habits of the Animation-Timing Jedi

1. Watch life in slow motion (literally)

Take videos of your cat jumping off the couch. Slow it down. Study the arc.
Forget Netflix. I’ve spent more time analyzing my neighbor tripping over his garden hose than any Marvel movie.

2. Animate 2 seconds a day — but animate them like they owe you money

You don’t need to make an epic. Just make 48 frames feel like they’re auditioning for an Oscar.

3. Play the “Too Fast or Too Slow?” game

Rewatch your animations and ask:
“Does this character blink like a person... or like a malfunctioning robot?”

If your character enters the frame like they just drank five Red Bulls, slow it down.
If they move like they're underwater in molasses, speed it up.
Trust your gut. And maybe your coffee intake.


---

Act 3: Timing Practice is Everywhere

- Dance videos

Breakdowns, beats, transitions = animation gold.
I now see every TikTok dancer as a mentor.

- Conversations

Listen to pauses. Punchlines. Reaction time.
Great animators are basically comedians with keyframes.

- Watch cartoons with a stopwatch

Yes, this is legal.
And no, your friends won’t understand why you’re timing Roadrunner’s jump arcs at 2am.
But that’s showbiz, baby.


---

Final Act: Your Keyframes Deserve Better

Don’t let your animation timing be the reason your epic 3D dragon looks like it’s on a slippery treadmill.

Get those habits in.
Study the bounce. Respect the ease. Worship the overshoot.

Because in motion design, “when” is just as important as “what.”

And if you time it right?
Even a rectangle can bring people to tears.

What’s your weirdest habit that actually made you a better animator? Drop it below—I need excuses to keep watching squirrel parkour in slow-mo.

**Part Eighteen**

No one wants to be caught looking at me, but they can’t help themselves from stealing quick glances towards my station every now and again. They’ll look at me and then they’ll look towards the empty station to my left. I can see it in their eyes; don’t upset or cross the entitled brat in the back of the room because bad things happen to those who do. Tommy’s example made an impact. Other children and their parents had that same mindset after what happened to a boy who scared me when I was five. I’ve resented the isolation I’ve felt for most of my life because of that, but it’s a blessing now. I’m certain that no one is going to be jumping at the chance to be anywhere near me. Simon’s station will probably be vacant for quite a while.

No one sitting next to me, listening to what I’m doing.

When I sit down, I immediately check to see if Simon’s credentials are still active, and to my relief, they are. The only person in Department 49 who isn’t avoiding eye contact with me is Norman. Not more than five minutes after I’ve sat down, he waddles over with two cups of coffee in his hands. He offers me one of the cups.

“It’s just coffee, I promise.” His smile is genuine and I take the cup. “Listen, Aaron, I just want to make sure you’re ok.”

“I’m fine, Norman.”

“Thomas had told me that you wouldn’t be in until tomorrow.”

“I know. I thought it was a good idea to come in and get right back to it. I don’t know how productive I’ll be today, but I just thought it was important to come in.”

“I understand. Listen…that… business with Simon. I want to apologize. I should’ve caught that. He’d given me problems before, nothing like that mind you, but… I should have been doing a better job of keeping an eye on you.” I want to keep up the facade of the spoiled asshole, but Norman’s face is disarming. His concern is honest. 

*Sure, Aaron. He also runs a department that preys on hopeless people.*

He sits down in Simon’s chair and lowers his voice. “You know, you don’t have to be here today. I understand what you’re saying, but…take a day at home, get some rest. This is the hardest station in City Hall, I don’t care what anybody says. It can really get to you sometimes. I know, trust me. I’ve been there.” 

“Norman? Can I ask you something?”

“Absolutely!” His round face lights up. He takes a sip of coffee and leans forward with genuine interest.

“You told me that you had a hard time when you first started here.” He shifts in the seat and he puts his cup down on Simon’s desk. He scratches the top of his head. This was not the direction he thought the conversation would take. “You said you had a sympathy violation. Can I ask why?”

“Oh that was a long time ago, Aaron. Over thirty years. It’s really not that important anymore.”

“I’d really like to know what happened.” He looks around the room. I notice he’s not looking at anyone else, he’s looking up high. I follow his gaze up to the two cameras mounted just under the ceiling at the front of the room. Then he looks back at me. He starts to say something and then he stops as if he’s decided it’s better to try and brush me off. “Norman. We both know my career doesn’t end in this room. It’s only a matter of time until I’m running all of this with Thomas. I’ll find out eventually on my own, but I’d like to hear it from you rather than reading it on a damn screen.”

“Well… it was my first day. Most of the people who come in here are placed by the program because they’re selected. I was placed in here because the program couldn’t find a single place where I would be the best fit. Back in those days, there weren’t as many of us here in the city, so… The Founders were just trying to keep the human side of the system running. I ended up in here because of a random lottery. My luck!” He gives me a nervous chuckle while he keeps looking around. He’s choosing his words carefully. “Anyway… the first day was rough, but I was able to pull through until right at the very end. Back then, a lot of the chattel were prone to… rebel… so it was far more brutal behind the wall. Control was tenuous at best. There were small groups of the older ones here and there who thought they had made a mistake by agreeing to live behind the wall… as if they truly ever had a choice… anyway… they agitated quite a few of the younger people with their stories of the way things used to be. It caused a lot of violence behind the wall. It looked as if it was just going to escalate right up until the rampage of the Red Bishop ended all of that. Also, a lot of people were reporting on each other for smaller violations, so the Examples were far more frequent than they are now.”

One of the technicians in the front of the room claps his hands twice and everyone in the room, including Norman, smiles and shouts their robotic exclamation. 

“Amen!”

Another “Praise Consensus”, another life lost. 

Norman goes straight back into his story. His smile is gone again, his voice lower and more serious than I’ve ever heard it.

“Anyway…I’m getting off track. My last call of the day was a login from a ten year old female chattel. She had reported her parents a couple months before for hiding a book. They decided that they wanted to teach the female the religion that their parents followed before everyone was moved behind the wall. They trusted their daughter and it cost them. The female decided to turn in her own parents for crimes against Consensus. 

They were purified right in front of her. I don’t think she truly understood what was going to happen.

I think she thought they were only going to receive a warning.

Her first two offences came very quickly after the purification, but the third offence, the one I responded to, was over two months later. The chattel was completely overwhelmed with guilt and she couldn’t carry the burden anymore. A ten year old.

…

 She told the system that she kept having nightmares of her mother telling her that she understood and that it wasn’t her fault, all while she was burning right in front of her. 

…

…

Anyway… the data from Consensus all pointed to a damaged little girl that would not be a…” He looks down. He clears his throat and takes off his glasses and rubs his temples before he puts them back on. He takes a deep breath. He looks at me and smiles. His voice is a higher pitch now. He’s composed himself.

“The system made the judgement that the chattel was no longer viable. Too much trauma. Too young to bounce back and make anything useful of herself. And instead of doing my job, I tried to talk her back from where she was inevitably headed. I figured that I would explain why I made that decision and I went to my supervisor. I pleaded with him to spare her life and he brought the matter to your father in the control room. Thomas is much easier to talk to than your father was when he was in control. Anyway… the chattel was purified and it was made very clear to me that I was wrong. Needless to say, I learned my lesson.”

We look at each other in silence. The rest of the room continues on with their duties. Someone in the room claps their hands twice and all the technicians give an amen. Norman doesn’t. He just looks at me. The look on his face is making the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. He doesn’t say anything more.

“I’m very sorry to hear that, Norman.”

“Life goes on. Likewise, I’m very happy to see that you’re obviously feeling much better.”

“I am. Thank you.”

“Aaron… When I was your age, young people were far too idealistic and we had these irresponsible notions of how things should be. Those notions…those ideals… they can get you into trouble. I was lucky. I learned after the first violation. If I had known better, I would have handled things differently... much differently.” He looks away, back towards the cameras at the front of the room. He gets lost in thought for a moment, but then his eyes move back to mine.  

“Someone’s always watching. The system is bigger than one person. It’s too big to change. If you stand directly in its way, it’ll crush you. My violation was very painful. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. Anyone.” He smiles and it's unnerving. He changes back into his jovial self and I don’t know how to take it. 

“But why would anyone want to stand in the way of something so perfect? Right? Our society is beautiful in every way, and I’m very grateful for the lives we all have here. Anyway, I’m glad you’re feeling better. I’ll let you get back to your duties. Very much looking forward to seeing how your career progresses!” He pats me on the shoulder and snatches his coffee from the desk. He groans as he rises from Simon’s chair and his knees pop. Another technician claps twice as I watch Norman go back to the front of the room.

I share in the amen this time.

I look at the cameras at the front of the room.

\-

I spend the rest of my time before the lunch break looking at monitoring station feeds. I ignore the incoming calls from the system, just like Simon did before the break. It takes me a while, but eventually, I find the station feeds inside City Hall. There are cameras in every department. Only the basement and the control room are absent. I find the feeds for Department 49. I see myself at the back of the room.

I minimize the tiles on my monitor as everyone files out of the room for their lunch break, and once I’m alone, I bring them back up. I don’t see any options for audio, the cameras are only visual, at least as far as I can tell. I use the controls and move both of them down to where my station is just out of frame. I keep the tiles up in the corner of my screen so I can see if anyone moves them back.

I hear a ring in my earpiece.

I have just under an hour before anyone comes back. I log into the system with Simon’s credentials and I begin.

\-

Nine people. That was all.

Everyone files back into the department after their break. No one notices that I log out of the system and then log back in. I move the cameras in the room back into their original positions and I put my head in my hands.

I tell myself that I had to be cruel to those people. I had to scare them like I scared that young woman two days ago. I needed to make sure that they would never bring up that conversation with Consensus again. I had to scare them into compliance.

*How do you know they won’t follow through with hurting themselves?*

I don’t. I have to hope. I wish I could give them hope; a kind word. Anything to let them know that they’re not alone and they’re not wrong for feeling that all of this isn’t right, but if I did, they would want more. They would hope for more kindness from Consensus, and they would find none. I have to be cruel. Right now it’s the only thing I can think of to help those people. I erased all of their third violations from the system and I hope they never make another. I haven’t figured out my next move.

*Your opening is weak.*

Small beginnings. Unfortunately, I know what comes next. I have a part to play. I have sacrifices that I need to make.

I hear a ring in my earpiece and my stomach turns and I begin.

\-

I take my time with each of them for the remainder of my shift. I try to have the least amount of reductions that I can.

*They’re not reductions, they’re people.*

I can’t think about that right now. I’ve saved nine people today. I’m seeing Heather soon. I have to keep my mind on those two things.

I choose my words carefully. I’m effective. I have to make sure they end their lives peacefully on their own and not by a Bishops hammer or the fire from a Clerk. 

Someday things will change. I have to believe that.

Six minutes before my shift ends, I hear the last ring. I connect with the call and I try to go through the usual opening, but the woman behind the wall is already speaking. She’s crying.

“I ran home… I tried to make it back here in time for my login… but it doesn’t matter anymore. Send whoever you want…”

I read about her violations. Mary. Age thirty eight. She lives in Castor’s district. 

“it doesn’t matter anymore…you don’t matter…”

Only surviving member of her family. Her son was just recently made an Example. He was almost sixteen.

“I don’t care if you hear me… I want you to listen.”

I realize that I watched her son die. The boy with the burned face that Simon’s hero cut into pieces after he tried to help a girl in his building. The video is in her information. I keep reading and she keeps talking.

“I want you to hear that I cursed you with my last breath… I know someday you’ll end. I know someday that people will finally get tired of you and all of those awful Bishops and Clerks… do you know how I know this? I know it because my son told me…”

“Your son told you?” 

“Yes.”

“Before he died?”

“After… he tells me every time I fall asleep… I hear him like I hear you now… he tells me to hold on because everything’s about to change…he tells me that you’re almost finished… that you’ll be broken from the inside out…”

Her husband and her other son died in a fire in their building fifteen years ago. She made it out with her youngest son. He was barely two years old. There’s another video in her file. The video of her son trying to stop four Clerks from Purifying an old man on the street. I watch the video while she talks. 

It’s taken from a station across the street. I watch him do something that I know I would not be brave enough to do. A crowd is gathered around the old man and the Clerks. They raise their left hands and the kid runs forward. He’s the only person who tries to stop it. He throws himself into the Clerks. He had to know that he couldn’t stop them, but he tried anyway. I’m so involved in the video that I fail to notice that the woman has stopped speaking. I need to say something.

“Is that all?”

“No… he told me something else…”

I watch one of the Clerks raise his hand and cover the kid’s face in flames. The kid rolls around on the damp street until he finds a puddle where he douses the flames. He’s screaming in agony while the Clerks purify the old man. No one steps forward to check on the kid until the Clerks walk away.

“He keeps saying someone is about to solve the puzzle…”

I roll back the video. I’m inspired by his defiance and his bravery. I want to be like that. I want to see his face. I’ve only seen it after it was burned. I’ve only seen it after Castor had his way with him. I need to know his face. I want to remember it. I pause the footage and zoom in on his face under the light from the street lamp.

“Someone is about to win your game.”

Time stops. 

Confusion sets in.

I recognize the face of the kid. I’ve seen it my whole life. 

He looks just like me.

“Holy shit…” The words slip out of my mouth, and once they do, nothing else follows.

…

…

“Consensus? Did you hear what I said? DO I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?!”

I started working immediately after I got my exam results so didn't go convocation etc. Got full scholarship for Masters so didn't need certificate then either. Every job I worked nobody asked me for my bachelor's certificate. 

  
Now as I'm applying for a PHD program, they're asking for a bachelor's certificate. After turning my room upside down, I realized I didn't have it in the first place. Migration, character, marksheets, vaccine card, coffee loyalty card, my gym card, I have it all except that damn piece of paper that says I completed that god damn degree those years ago.

  
By the time TU gets me the certificate the deadline for the program will be gone. 

  
Moral: Don't be stupid and lazy like me and lose the opportunity of a life time. Get all your paperworks sorted, water proof them, photo copy them, scan them, fax them to your aunty abroad, distribute them to 5 of your closest people as well.

But, I kid you not, like five minutes in, it turned into a full-blown therapy session... for him. 😅 He casually slipped in that he's been stressed, so I asked why (you know, typical small talk), and that was my first mistake. From there, he unleashed a saga about his career struggles, his ex (apparently a ""witch"" of an ex-wife), and his existential crisis due to turning 30... 3 years ago. I felt like I should've charged by the hour!

It got to the point where I was nodding and giving noncommittal ""uh-huhs,"" while internally questioning my life choices. Clearly, he was looking for a counselor, not a coffee date. And, of course, I couldn't help but feel a bit bad for him, even tho the vibes were way off, ngl. By the end, all I knew was his life story, and he prob couldn't tell you my name.

I would even argue that your regular softdrinks are worst than energy drinks. 

""Energy drinks have too much caffeine""

Well a normal 250ml energy drink has about 80mg of caffeine. Even your average brewed coffee has more caffeine ~95mg. A normal adult person can handle up to 400mg of caffeine in a day. 

""There's way too much sugar""

The average sugar amount of energy drinks per 250 ml is just about 25-30g. Which is roughly the same as softdrinks. There are also no sugar energy drink options, if this is your deal breaker. 

I just haven't seen any convincing report that energy drinks are THAT bad. If they are wouldn't they banned? Plus they got b vitamins, inositol, taurine and etc, to help improve mental shapness. They are very good to have as a plus in your drinks.

Just drink moderately just like any other drinks/bevs.",15,1748239532.0,unpopularopinion,20,0.65,False

I've spent decades in finance, and I'm here to tell you something that'll make your compliance department sweat: most financial and consulting professionals are nothing more than sophisticated parasites in expensive suits.

You know the type. They slide into your LinkedIn DMs with laser precision, armed with buzzwords like ""synergy"" and ""value-add."" Their enthusiasm burns bright as a supernova—right up until they realize you can't write them a check or connect them to someone who can or you did deliver on their ask. Then? *Poof.* They vanish faster than your 401k during a market crash.

# The Great Financial Ghosting

Here's how it works: These financial vampires identify their target (you), deploy their charm offensive (coffee meetings, lunch invitations, ""I'd love to pick your brain"" sessions), extract what they need (your contacts, your insights, your time), and then disappear into the ether like they never existed. No follow-up. No thank you. No acknowledgment that you just gave them two hours of your life you'll never get back.

It's not networking—it's extraction. And it's unacceptable.

I watched a ""wealth management specialist"" spend three months courting a small business owner, promising customized solutions and personalized service. The moment he discovered the guy's net worth was south of his minimum threshold? Radio silence. The business owner kept calling, wondering if he'd said something wrong. That's not professional service—that's emotional manipulation with a Series 7 license.

# The Time Vampire Economy

These people have turned time-wasting into an art form. They'll gladly consume your hours like a black hole consumes light, but try getting five minutes of their attention once they've determined you're not immediately profitable. They act like hawks circling to pounce. No time for you. 

Here's what really pisses me off: they're not just wasting your time—they're devaluing the entire profession. When you treat people like ATMs instead of human beings, when you ghost them the moment they're not immediately useful, you're not building a business. You're running a con game with business cards.

# The Radical Truth About Financial ""Relationships""

Let me tell you the truth that makes everyone uncomfortable: most financial relationships are transactional BS masquerading as genuine connection. These people don't want to know you—they want to know your bank balance or what is there to extract (knowledge, connections, money). They don't care about your goals—they care about their upside. They're not building relationships—they're building extraction pipelines.

And the worst part? They've convinced themselves they're providing value while they're busy hoovering up yours.

I've had strategy consultants contact me constantly to ""share experiences"" , which translates into how can they suck power point slides out of your brain to repackage and sell. Oh yeah, then they ghost you. I've watched investment advisors wine and dine prospects for weeks, then ghost them completely when they discover the money's tied up in trusts they can't touch.

This isn't relationship building—it's relationship strip-mining.

# The Professional Parasite Playbook

Here's their standard operating procedure:



1. Identify the target with apparent wealth/connections
2. Deploy artificial charm and fake interest
3. Extract maximum value (contacts, information, time)
4. Disappear without explanation or courtesy
5. Repeat with the next victim



It's sociopathic behavior dressed up in financial planning jargon.

# A Modest Proposal for Change

Here's a radical idea: treat people like human beings instead of profit centers. Shocking, I know.

If you're going to take someone's time, respect it. If you're going to build a relationship, build a real one. If you're going to make promises about service and attention, keep them regardless of the account size.

And if someone helps you—if they give you their time, their insights, their connections—acknowledge it. A simple ""thank you"" costs nothing and tells you everything about someone's character.

# The Bottom Line

The financial services industry is hemorrhaging trust because too many practitioners treat clients, thought leaders, and prospects like renewable resources to be extracted rather than relationships to be cultivated. Every ghost, every disappeared connection, every unreturned call after the check clears is another nail in the coffin of professional credibility.

You want to know why people hate dealing with financial or consulting professionals? Because too many of them act like emotional pickpockets—friendly until we've taken what we need, then gone without a trace.

The parasites are killing the host. And the host is our entire profession.

It's time to choose: Are you building relationships or running extraction operations? Because I guarantee you, in the long run, only one of those approaches builds anything worth having.

The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you've got it made.

1kvn3zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kvn3zu/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_hang_out_with_my_best/,AITAH for not wanting to hang out with my best friend’s nieces?,"My (27 F) best friend has two nieces, let’s call them Jane (9) and Jolene (13). I (28 F) met my best friend when we were freshmen in high school and have been inseparable since. We used to go out for drives and try new places to eat. As we got older, we’ve done that less often because I’ve started working for a startup company about 5 years ago and she’s been working as a freelance MUA in the past 3 years, so our schedules have been different (I work M-F and she works almost every weekend). 

Lately we’ve been trying to hang out more and have been making our schedules work - we’re doing a pretty good job with it, too! But I’ve also noticed she’s become more angry and literally everything, especially harmless things and it’s such a nasty thing to be around her or even speak to her (but this is a different issue in itself). Anyway, we’ve been making plans to do things, even just go out to brunch or visit a shop nearby, but she flakes every time. And when she does follow through with the plan, she brings her nieces with her. Sometimes she’ll let me know, but most times I don’t find out until shes already at my house, or as in getting in her car. I don’t have a problem with her nieces coming with us because I love kids, but she does this almost every time we hang out so we don’t end up doing what we originally planned. To make it perfectly clear, her brother (the girls’ dad) and his wife does not make her feel obligated to watch her nieces or bring her along. She just does this because she feels like it. Most of the time it’s just her and Jane because Jolene is now a teenager and wants to hang out with her own friends. 

Her nieces aren’t exactly rude, but they’re not polite or respectful either. Whenever she brings Jane to my and my fiancé’s (30 M) house, she gets really rowdy. She doesn’t turn the bathroom lights off, leaves the faucet running, and throws our cat and dog’s toys around with no regards to our furnitures getting damaged or falling over. She’s also very chatty (which, I know this is normal) and is rude about the things she says. My best friend thinks it’s so funny and always just says “omg she’s so sassy”. When I had them over my house for brunch, she complained about me not letting her help make breakfast (the food I was making wasn’t a simple meal so I couldn’t have a kid in the kitchen with me) so she just kept touching everything so what should have been an hour and half of prep and cooking combined turned into ALMOST THREE HOURS because she kept touching everything and placing them where they don’t belong. My best friend was just giggled and went back to being on her phone. After everything was done, she kept complaining how the food was taking too long and when the food was served, she didn’t even eat it. She took a bite and said “yuck, I don’t like it”. My fiancé gave me a look and my best friend just said “omg Jane, you’re so weird”. That’s it. I don’t say anything because it’s not my kids to lecture or correct, but I know I should also set boundaries with her and especially my best friend. But I also expect my best friend to at least correct her since SHE is the one bringing her around. 

We’ve made several plans and she’s flaked, but the times that she actually followed through, she brings her niece with her. As I mentioned, sometimes she’ll tell me, but most of the time she’ll bring her unannounced. There’s also been times where she just invites her niece assuming that it’s okay. 

Which brings me to my current dilemma: my fiancé and I decided to have a nice picnic last week since the weather was so nice. We invited my best friend and he invited his. When I told my best friend about the plan, she responded to my text: “sounds good! The girls would love a picnic! Not 100% sure Jolene will come because she’s been busy with gymnastics). I brushed it off and let her know more info as the day got closer. I hinted that I wanted it to be just us adults and it seemed that she got that because she stopped mentioning bringing Jane. Then the day before the picnic, I told her what time we’ll be meeting up and which part of the park and she says “cool! Jane and I will meet you guys there!” I showed the text to my fiancé and he just sighed and said that it’s fine if she wants to bring her niece, but he would’ve preferred she didn’t. The day of the picnic and everyone was so uncomfortable having a kid around because we felt like we had to restrict ourselves and we can’t say what we wanna say. My best friend on the other hand, was just on her phone and letting her niece pick at the foods we have. Like she’s literally poking her fingers at the food we have laid out and she’d just giggle at it and say “Jane, you’re so weird.” My fiancé’s best friend spoke up and said “why is there a kid here?” To which she got offended and told me to ask him to leave. I didn’t know what else to say so the words just came out of my mouth, “I think you and Jane should leave”. She was so shocked and hurt. 

Later that day she told me she doesn’t wanna speak to me ever again. She said some very hurtful things to me and about me, as well as my fiancé who has been nothing but kind and caring towards her. So I blew up and told her that I don’t wanna hang out with her and her nieces anyway and that they ruin our plans every time. I told her that it’s not okay that she just lets them trash my house and she doesn’t correct them. She told me that she never wants to see me ever again and that I’m a c**t for making a big deal about her nieces’ behaviors. 

AITAH for not wanting to hang out with her nieces all the time? 

PS - I have spoken to her about this in the past and she took it so personally that she didn’t speak to me for a month and only spoke to me cos she wanted to go try a new coffee shop with me. To which she also brought her niece with her. ",1,1748239339.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

# Introduction to Mid-Century Modern Design

Mid-century modern design is a design movement that emerged in the mid-20th century, primarily from the 1940s to the 1960s. This style is characterized by clean lines, organic forms, and a seamless integration of indoor and outdoor spaces. Its origins can be traced back to a desire for simplicity and functionality, driven by the post-war economic boom that allowed for innovative architectural techniques and materials. The influential work of designers such as Charles and Ray Eames and George Nelson cemented mid-century modern as a significant style that continues to inspire new generations of designers today.

One of the key characteristics of mid-century modern design is its emphasis on minimalism and efficiency. This aesthetic typically features furniture with sleek profiles, open floor plans, and an overall lack of ornamentation. Additionally, the movement heralds the use of natural materials such as wood, combined with newly available synthetic materials like fiberglass and plastics. As a result, mid-century modern interiors provide a warm yet sophisticated environment that resonates well with contemporary needs. The use of bold colors, geometric patterns, and iconic furniture pieces further emphasizes this aesthetic, making it a timeless choice for homeowners.

As we look towards 2025, it is essential to recognize how mid-century modern design continues to influence interior design trends. Many [Interior designers in Thane](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-thane/) and across the globe draw inspiration from the principles of this movement, incorporating its elements into modern homes.

# Embracing Sustainability in Mid-Century Design

As the world increasingly pivots towards eco-friendliness, the realm of mid-century modern design is not left behind. The essence of mid-century design, characterized by clean lines, organic forms, and functional beauty, can harmoniously intersect with sustainable practices. This growing trend allows designers to create spaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also environmentally responsible. Interior designers in Thane are beginning to embrace these practices, melding style with sustainability to create innovative living spaces.

One prominent way to implement sustainability in mid-century design is through the use of reclaimed wood. This material offers both a historical narrative and a unique character, making it an ideal choice for furniture production and home renovation.

 By opting for reclaimed wood, interior designers can achieve that warm, vintage vibe synonymous with mid-century aesthetics while promoting an eco-friendly approach. Furthermore, sourcing vintage furniture is another sustainable practice that aligns perfectly with the mid-century theme. Not only does it embody the spirit of the era, but it also significantly reduces the demand for newly manufactured items, contributing to a lower carbon footprint.

Sustainable textiles also play a vital role in mid-century modern design. Designers can choose fabrics made from organic or recycled materials, which align with the principles of eco-conscious living. For instance, opting for natural fibers such as cotton, linen, or hemp can add both texture and a sustainable edge to interior spaces. Collaborating with the best interior designers in Thane can help individuals find unique pieces that are not only stylish but also environmentally responsible.

# Bold Colors and Patterns: A New Take 

https://preview.redd.it/a1c083nqg23f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3083c56452aadd385c1e154f2b2d7832104216ed

In recent years, there has been a notable revival of bold colors and patterns within mid-century modern design, challenging the more muted palettes that dominated interiors in the past. This resurgence can be seen as a reaction to the minimalist trends that have increasingly replaced vivid expressions. Interior designers in Thane are spearheading this movement, cleverly combining vibrant hues with geometric patterns and daring prints to create spaces that are both lively and nostalgic.

To successfully integrate bold colors into your living spaces, start by selecting a color palette that resonates with the quintessential mid-century aesthetic. Rich shades of mustard yellow, teal, deep orange, and avacado green can be used as statement colors to infuse energy. These hues can either be applied to accent walls or through smaller decor elements such as cushions, rugs, and artwork. Pairing these bold colors with wooden furniture typical of the mid-century period can yield a harmonious balance that draws attention without overwhelming the senses.

Geometric patterns also play a critical role in revamping mid-century modern design for modern aesthetics. Opt for patterned wallpapers or textiles that feature clean lines and abstract shapes. Designers can introduce bold prints through statement pieces such as armchairs or throw pillows, effectively transforming a mundane space into a vibrant environment. The [best interior designers in Thane](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-thane/) often utilize such strategies to accentuate features of a room, creating focal points that invite intrigue.

Furthermore, embracing maximalism in decor allows for layering different textures while remaining true to the mid-century philosophy of functionality. Pairing lively colors and patterns with sleek furniture designed for comfort is essential in achieving a contemporary mid-century feel. Luxury interior designers in Thane can provide valuable guidance on sourcing materials and pieces that not only look visually appealing but also uphold the ethos of the mid-century modern era.

In the realm of interior design, the incorporation of modern technology within established aesthetics is becoming increasingly significant, especially for mid-century modern design. This design movement is renowned for its simplicity, clean lines, and functional furnishings, making it essential to choose technological solutions that resonate with these principles. When seeking the expertise of interior designers in Thane, one can explore innovative methods to blend technology without disrupting the essence of mid-century modern spaces.

To achieve a harmonious integration, consider smart home devices that blend seamlessly with the minimalist design. For instance, smart thermostats and lighting systems can be discreetly installed within the existing framework, allowing for energy efficiency without compromising on style. Energy-efficient appliances are also a crucial aspect, as they reduce the carbon footprint while maintaining the clean aesthetic that mid-century furniture embodies.

Audio-visual systems, particularly those that support streaming services, can be stylishly integrated into mid-century modern furniture. Wall-mounted televisions with sleek frames or soundbars that mimic the clean lines of the original furniture pieces can enhance the living space aesthetically. It is also worthwhile to highlight the growing trend of utilizing vintage-inspired technology, such as record players or vintage-style radios, which can provide functionality while honoring the design era.

Engaging with the best interior designers in Thane can facilitate the discovery of bespoke solutions that align with one's personal taste while incorporating functional advancements. By focusing on a selective approach, homeowners can unveil the potential of their spaces, complementing the classic characteristics of mid-century design with discreet but effective technology.

# Multi-Functional Spaces for Modern Living 

https://preview.redd.it/bukwgs4og23f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffb1c6b3a3a07ac6758ac6d565f40ef1622cec7a

In the rapidly evolving landscape of interior design, especially within urban environments like Thane, creating multi-functional spaces has become paramount. The principles of mid-century modern design emphasize simplicity, functionality, and the blending of indoor and outdoor spaces. This aesthetic lends itself well to the need for versatility in contemporary homes. Interior designers in Thane are increasingly adopting these principles to cater to families and individuals who value both style and practicality.

Open floor plans are a hallmark of mid-century design, promoting fluidity between different living areas. By removing unnecessary walls, spaces become more adaptable, allowing for various uses throughout the day. For instance, a living room can easily transform into a workspace during the day, only to return to an entertainment area in the evening. Incorporating modular furniture is essential here; pieces that can be moved, reconfigured, or even expanded ensure that the space serves multiple purposes without sacrificing aesthetics. This aligns seamlessly with the philosophies of the best interior designers in Thane, who prioritize flexibility and style in their projects.

Another significant consideration is the integration of technology. Multi-functional spaces can benefit from smart home features that enable seamless transitions between activities. For example, adjustable lighting can set the mood for a gathering or provide focused task lighting for work. With this approach, luxury interior designers in Thane are emphasizing the importance of creating environments that not only look good but also enhance the user experience through convenience and adaptability.

In summary, the incorporation of multi-functional spaces in modern living reflects the enduring influence of mid-century design principles. By emphasizing open layouts and modular furniture, interior designers in Thane are crafting homes that align with today's dynamic lifestyles, offering a perfect balance of elegance and practicality.

# Vintage and Modern: The Perfect Blend 

https://preview.redd.it/vhcgyrzmg23f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd833df6baed25a9bbb5bfd284af0273d21807df

Combining vintage mid-century pieces with contemporary design elements creates a striking aesthetic that celebrates the best of both worlds. This approach not only honors the historical significance of mid-century designs but also infuses modern practicality, making it a favored choice among interior designers in Thane. To achieve this balance, it is essential to carefully consider color palettes, textures, and furniture placements.

Color plays a vital role in harmonizing the two styles. Mid-century designs often feature earthy tones, muted hues, and vibrant pops of color, such as mustard yellow or teal. By integrating these shades into a contemporary palette, one can create a cohesive look that respects the vintage essence while appealing to modern sensibilities. For instance, pairing a classic teak sideboard with a contemporary light fixture in matte black can evoke nostalgia while maintaining a fresh ambiance.

Texture is another critical element in achieving this perfect blend. Contemporary designs often emphasize minimalism and sleek surfaces, while mid-century pieces are characterized by rich materials and intricate details. Incorporating a plush, textured rug beneath a modern coffee table can soften the overall look, allowing the warmth of vintage textures to flow seamlessly with clean-lined furniture. This thoughtful integration can lead to the emergence of unique spaces that reflect one's personal style.

Furniture placement is equally important to ensure that vintage and modern elements complement each other. Placing a mid-century armchair alongside a modern sofa can create a conversation area that is both inviting and visually appealing. Top interior designers in Thane recommend experimenting with arrangements that highlight key pieces from both eras, thereby fostering an inviting and dynamic atmosphere in the space.

Ultimately, the fusion of vintage and modern styles offers a versatile approach to interior design. [Luxury interior designers in Thane](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-thane/) can guide homeowners in selecting the best mid-century elements that resonate with contemporary aesthetics, providing a lasting impact. This blend not only enhances the functionality of spaces but also celebrates design history, ensuring that the essence of both styles remains intact.

# Natural Light and Open Spaces 

https://preview.redd.it/lwmfu3wlg23f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aadf3a63e174d6acd1761c81fc274bdba89738ee

Mid-century modern design is characterized by its seamless fusion with nature, and one of the core elements that underpin this aesthetic is the use of natural light. By integrating large windows into architectural designs, interior designers in Thane can effectively create bright, open spaces that invite the outdoors in. This design philosophy emphasizes transparency and connection with the environment, resulting in interiors that feel expansive and welcoming. The careful placement of windows not only enhances the flow of light but also highlights the beauty of surrounding landscapes, making the house feel alive and harmonious with its setting.

In addition to large windows, incorporating skylights can significantly amplify the ambiance within a space. Skylights work to draw in natural light from above, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. This is particularly important in areas such as living rooms and kitchens, where an abundance of light can enhance the overall mood and functionality of the space. Luxury interior designers in Thane often recommend this technique, as it provides a unique architectural feature that elevates the design while maximizing the benefits of sunlight.

To further achieve an airy environment, reflective surfaces should be utilized throughout the space. High-gloss finishes and mirrors can bounce light around, making even smaller rooms appear larger and more open. This strategy aligns perfectly with the mid-century modern emphasis on minimalism and functionality, allowing for a thoughtful and uncluttered design. The best interior designers in Thane suggest maintaining a balance between light and shadow, creating a visually pleasing contrast that emphasizes architectural lines and furniture arrangements.

Ultimately, achieving the perfect mid-century modern aesthetic relies heavily on natural light and open spaces. By thoughtfully incorporating these elements, homeowners can create inviting environments that reflect their personal style while remaining true to the essence of this timeless design movement.

# Landscaping with Mid-Century Flair

Incorporating mid-century modern design principles into landscaping can transform outdoor spaces into extensions of the home. This design aesthetic, characterized by clean lines and organic forms, encourages seamless integration between the indoor and outdoor environments. Homeowners looking to achieve a sophisticated look should focus on using native plants that are low maintenance and environmentally friendly. These selections not only enhance the visual appeal but also support local wildlife, creating a harmonious balance with nature.

One effective way to apply mid-century modern design in landscaping is through structured pathways. Opting for geometric shapes and straight lines can guide visitors through the garden while providing a sense of order. Materials like concrete or flagstone can be used to create sleek walkways that resonate with the principles of minimalism integral to mid-century design. Such pathways invite exploration and interaction, making the outdoor area more enjoyable.

Furthermore, outdoor furniture plays a pivotal role in reflecting the mid-century aesthetic. Selecting pieces that feature organic shapes, functional designs, and vibrant colors can significantly enhance the garden's overall look. Iconic designs, such as those by Eames or Saarinen, can be incorporated to evoke the classic mid-century feel while ensuring comfort and utility. Utilizing materials like teak or metal not only aligns with the aesthetics but also offers durability against the elements.

1kvn2qx,https://i.redd.it/uemfw5gpf23f1.png,"No More Layovers for a Love That Won’t Land-  Freya, Mr. Whitemore signed off on your resignation papers, but he didn't notice it was you leaving-Got the full version of the story.","Freya, Mr. Whitemore signed off on your resignation papers, but he didn't notice it was you leaving. Want me to let him know?"" The HR director's voice came through the phone, concern evident.  
  
Freya's eyes lowered as she replied softly, ""No need. Just leave it as is.""  
  
""But you've been his right hand for four years! He values you more than anyone and totally depends on you. Are you absolutely sure about quitting?""  
  
HR was practically begging, but Freya just offered a small smile.  
  
""Nobody's irreplaceable in this world. My parents aren't doing well, and I need to head back home to settle down. Since Mr. Whitemore approved it, I'll handle the transition. I'll be gone in a month. Thanks for checking.""  
  
After hanging up, Freya went back to sorting through her things. She'd lived in this penthouse for three years. Not too much stuff, not too little—just keeping essentials and tossing the rest.  
  
As the room emptied, she felt momentarily disoriented, memories washing over her like waves.  
  
Eight years ago, Freya—a small-town girl from a modest family—got into Harvard and became best friends with New York heiress Elena Whitemore.  
  
Despite their completely different backgrounds, they clicked instantly—attending lectures together, grabbing lunch, hitting the shops—practically joined at the hip every day.  
  
Gradually, Elena brought Freya into her world, introduced her to family, and unwittingly, Freya fell hard for Elena's brother, Jasper. But she buried those feelings deep, never breathing a word to anyone.  
  
After graduation, Elena took off to study in Paris. Freya stayed in New York, landed a job as Jasper's assistant—all to be near him.  
  
Then came that night when someone slipped something into Jasper's drink. Freya was about to call 911 when he pinned her against the wall, his control gone as his mouth claimed hers.  
  
After a night together, she woke to find him by the window, his sharp profile haloed in cigarette smoke, brooding and distant.  
  
Hearing her stir, he turned. ""You're into me, aren't you?""  
  
Freya instinctively wanted to deny it, but he continued, his face expressionless.  
  
""You blush whenever I walk in. You know all my likes and dislikes. You jumped at becoming my assistant right after graduation...""  
  
""Don't tell me that's all coincidence.""  
  
His words left her face burning, from embarrassment or guilt, she wasn't sure which.  
  
In the heavy silence, he suddenly handed her a card.  
  
""Last night shouldn't have happened. I'm in love with someone else and can't return your feelings or take responsibility. Elena mentioned you come from a modest background—there's enough money on this card to set you up for life. Let's both forget this ever happened.""  
  
Freya was stunned. Then she remembered he'd repeatedly called out a name in bed: Mia. Mia Carter.  
  
From Elena, Freya knew Mia was Jasper's unforgettable first love. He was so hung up on her that even after she dumped him and moved abroad, collecting a string of rumored boyfriends, he insisted on waiting for her return.  
  
Freya recalled Elena's eye-roll: ""The Whitemores are known for being cold fish. How did my brother turn into such a hopeless romantic? Waiting all these years, saying everyone else would be 'settling' because he refuses to settle.""  
  
Feeling this in her bones, Freya suddenly found her courage and called after Jasper as he headed for the door.  
  
""I don't want your money. I just want a chance. Please, just try being with me. If she never comes back or... if she does return but you still can't move on, I'll walk away. I promise.""  
  
Faced with her lovesick gaze, Jasper paused for a beat before muttering, ""Whatever,"" and walking out.  
  
From that day forward, Freya was his assistant by day and his lover by night. They left their mark in his office, his Maybach, against the windows of his penthouse. Four years passed with no one knowing about their arrangement, and she told herself she was happy.  
  
Until his birthday a few days ago. Freya had planned several surprises to celebrate. But as midnight approached, instead of Jasper, she got a notification from his social media—an account he'd never used before.  
  
""Best birthday gift? Getting back what I lost.""  
  
The forever-silent Jasper Whitemore had posted a photo of himself kissing Mia Carter beneath exploding fireworks.  
  
Seeing this, the blood drained from Freya's face, her chest tightening. With one last desperate hope, she called him.  
  
Mia answered. After saying ""hello"" several times to silence, she called out: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""  
  
A moment later, his deep, cool voice came through the speaker: ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""  
  
In that moment, Freya knew her exit cue had arrived.  
  
She packed her things, ready to leave, when she ran into Jasper at the door. Since they'd been sleeping together regularly, Freya had been staying at his place for convenience—but now, she couldn't stay another night.  
  
Seeing her with her bags, his eyes narrowed slightly, but he made no move to stop her. ""Found a place?""  
  
""Yeah, my old apartment. Talked to the landlord—just for a month.""  
  
At this, Jasper frowned. ""A month? What for?""  
  
Freya started to explain, but he seemed to lose interest, merely saying, ""I'll drive you.""  
  
She tried to refuse, but he insisted.  
  
""It's dumping snow out there, and it's late. If anything happened to you, Elena would kill me.""  
  
Freya reluctantly got into his car. Once, they'd been intimate countless times in this vehicle, but now she barely recognized it. The interior was plastered with cute plushies, Hello Kitty seat covers, and snacks everywhere...  
  
She could hardly imagine this serious, standoffish man transforming his car into something so cutesy.  
  
Noticing her stare, Jasper offered a brief explanation: ""Mia's into this stuff.""  
  
Freya got his meaning and stayed quiet for a long while before responding softly.  
  
""You finally got her back. I'm happy for you, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
Jasper hadn't expected that response. His eyes darkened, and he said nothing more.  
  
Halfway to her place, Mia called, wanting to build a snowman with him. He pulled over, clearly eager to go to her, but hesitated when he glanced at Freya.  
  
Understanding his dilemma, Freya opened the door. ""I'll grab a Uber from here, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
He nodded and got out to help with her stuff. Her hands slipped, and the box crashed to the ground. As he bent down, the streetlight illuminated its spilled contents, freezing him in place.  
  
Love letters addressed to him but never sent, candid photos she'd secretly taken, things he'd tossed that she'd rescued and treasured...  
  
Freya's heart hammered as she scrambled to gather everything.  
  
""Sorry about that.""  
  
Without a word, Jasper got back in his car and sped away.  
  
Freya waited in the snow for ages but couldn't get a ride. Trying to lug her box home, she was hit by an electric scooter.  
  
The collision left a nasty gash on her calf, blood staining the snow. Watching the hit-and-run driver disappear, she gasped with pain, lying in the snow for what felt like forever.  
  
When she could finally move, she limped through the snow for four hours before reaching her apartment.  
  
After patching up her wound, she checked her phone to find a message from Jasper, sent after he'd left:  
  
\[Stop being so obsessed with one guy. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't hang all your hopes on me.\]  
  
Freya stared at this message for a very long time.  
  
At dawn, she went downstairs, set fire to the box, and burned everything inside it. The love that had burned fiercely in her heart for eight years turned to ashes alongside those mementos.  
  
Jasper Whitemore, I'll grant your wish.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After a quiet weekend, Monday morning rolled around, and Freya arrived at work on schedule.  
  
She handled her usual tasks, including notifying Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and stopped cold.  
  
Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The famously germaphobic CEO actually ate it with a smile, then gently kissed her fingertips.  
  
""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.  
  
""Mmm, they're perfect—sweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.  
  
The look on Jasper's face was pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""  
  
Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, completely lost in the moment.  
  
Watching them, Freya felt like she'd been punched in the chest, a bitter ache spreading through her. Her fingernails dug deep into her palms, leaving bloody crescents behind.  
  
As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.  
  
""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""  
  
Hearing her, Jasper tensed slightly and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.  
  
""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy-dog eyes.  
  
Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.  
  
""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.  
  
This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations that was crucial to the company's future. Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:  
  
""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""  
  
""God, Jasper, your assistant is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.  
  
Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""  
  
Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.  
  
Everyone in their circle knew Jasper was a workaholic machine. No matter what was happening personally—even right after surgery—he'd drag himself in to finish his work.  
  
Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining. This was completely new territory.  
  
Did he really love Mia that much?  
  
Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.  
  
The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being pissed, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.  
  
She took their verbal abuse silently, head down.  
  
After an excruciating two-hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.  
  
""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make killer coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet—whip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""  
  
Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.  
  
Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.  
  
After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.  
  
The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.  
  
Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.  
  
Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.  
  
Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.  
  
The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.  
  
The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.  
  
""What the hell happened?""  
  
Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. My cramps are killing me now.""  
  
Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.  
  
""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""  
  
Freya raised her deathly pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another assistant.  
  
""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company-wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all-hands.""  
  
With that, Jasper draped his jacket over Mia's shoulders and led her away.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
As Jasper vanished down the corridor, the tears Freya had been fighting finally broke free.  
  
She forced herself up, wincing as she grabbed a broom and mop to tackle the mess of shattered ceramic and coffee.  
  
A few sympathetic coworkers came to help, their eyes full of pity.  
  
""I clearly heard her say 'with ice, no sugar.' How's she flipping this on you? Did you tick her off somehow?"" one whispered.  
  
""Like she needs a reason?"" another muttered. ""Everyone knows she's a total princess. Throws a fit over nothing. Half our circle can't stand her, but with Jasper in her pocket, nobody dares say boo.""  
  
""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks—we can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""  
  
Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled.  
  
Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.  
  
But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just assumes she's at fault.  
  
After years of dedication, handling countless fires for him—didn't she deserve that basic trust?  
  
Or in his world, did right and wrong not matter as long as Mia was happy?  
  
The thought left her heart feeling like raw hamburger.  
  
It took forever to clean everything before dragging her battered body home.  
  
She had barely stepped out of the shower when her phone lit up with Jasper's name.  
  
""Bring over some Advil and heating pads.""  
  
She threw everything together ASAP and headed to his penthouse.  
  
In just days, the once sleek space had transformed completely. The cherry tree his grandfather planted—gone, replaced by tulips. The black and white furniture he'd always preferred—swapped for pink and yellow pieces he used to mock. Display cases now showcased jewelry, designer bags, and gifts...  
  
Pure Mia, through and through.  
  
Freya took it all in silently before knocking on the bedroom door.  
  
Jasper opened it, grabbed the stuff, and finally glanced at her face.  
  
With the coffee cleaned off, her injuries looked brutal, making him pause.  
  
""Jesus. Have you had that checked out?""  
  
Freya just shook her head.  
  
He rubbed his temple, his tone softening slightly.  
  
""Look, Mia was just feeling like garbage. She wasn't gunning for you specifically, so don't take it personally. I'll add what I docked from your pay to your Christmas bonus. Get those wounds looked at—if they're bad, take a few sick days. I'll sign off on it, no red tape.""  
  
""That won't be necessary. At the end of this month—""  
  
Freya tried telling him about her resignation, but he cut her off, shoving a card into her hand.  
  
""Just do what I'm telling you. I need you to put together a welcome-back thing for Mia, so rest up and heal.""  
  
The words died in Freya's throat.  
  
She nodded, took the card, and turned to leave.  
  
As the door swung shut, she caught Mia's voice:  
  
""Babe, is that tea ready? Can you come rub my stomach?""  
  
""Coming right now. Just lie still and don't move, okay?""  
  
Hearing his tender tone, Freya smiled bitterly.  
  
Her own cramps were brutal too—she'd actually passed out at work multiple times and been rushed to the ER.  
  
When he found out? Just a signed time-off form. No visits, no tea, no heating pads.  
  
Back then, she'd told herself he was swamped with work.  
  
Now she got it—he just didn't give a damn.  
  
After leaving, Freya hit up urgent care for basic treatment.  
  
She crashed at home for a few days before getting bombarded with party specs from his assistant.  
  
Everything from floral arrangements to dessert selections to server uniforms came with ridiculous requirements.  
  
With just three days to pull it off, Freya pushed through her exhaustion to make it happen.  
  
After running herself ragged, the party kicked off at 7 PM sharp.  
  
Mia floated in wearing some couture masterpiece, immediately becoming the room's center of gravity.  
  
Guests swarmed her with compliments, feeding her ego.  
  
""It's been ages, but you're still that same knockout, Mia. Even a 'casual' welcome-back party looks like the Met Gala—clearly Jasper's still completely whipped!""  
  
""Remember college when some poor schmuck asked Mia out? Jasper literally got the guy transferred! He shredded love letters on sight, and when people talked smack about Mia, he put those dudes in the hospital!""  
  
""Everyone knows Mia's his kryptonite—the one he can't resist! Look at that ice she's wearing—gotta be worth a couple million! And that dress is one-of-a-kind. Jasper's always been 'price is no object' when it comes to keeping Mia happy!""

1kvmw0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/cs2b/comments/1kvmw0e/explaining_virtuals_with_an_analogy/,explaining virtuals with an analogy,"Just DAWGed the octapus quest and we used it a TON here, so after a lengthy conversation with chatGPT I wanted to explain it to check my understanding.

Here's the analogy, and then I'll attach it to what's happening:

You just started a company, and it's empty, but you have roles like CEO, engineer, and intern all outlined for what they should be doing. Each role has a little helpful clipboard that translates general tasks into specific ones for their job. An example is if you tell them to do work, the CEO knows to host a meeting by looking at this table and realizing that doing work = hosting a meeting for their role. For interns, do work means grabbing coffee and handing it to someone who wants it. When you start to hire people, each of them gets a little reminder written on their hand to look at their clipboard whenever they get one of these directives. Now, you have a company filled to the brim with these people, so when you say do work to the employees, each one checks their hand and then their clipboard to know what to do.

Now for the breakdown:

* Starting the company and it being empty is essentially what you have at compile time - in this case, we had to use virtuals to compile things at runtime
* All the different roles/jobs are really classes underneath the general role of employee (ie, the base class like shape for our quest)
* The reminder on their hand is a vptr (virtual pointer) that is looked at whenever you have a virtual
* The vptr points to a vtable, which is a virtual table that says exactly what the specific class should do with the function
* Getting coffee and hosting a meeting is what the do\_work function maps to for the specific class

Important things to note:

* We couldn't do this at compile time because we didn't know what the objects (ie, people going to become employees) were, so we had to make a whole system that would let us figure it out at runtime
   * To this point, it's because pointers can't be evaluated at compile time, unlike variables, so you can't do it like this
   * Otherwise, in the same way that you overload an operator and you choose which one by passing in different arguments, you could theoretically just have the class\_name.function() figure it out regardless of the arguments because of the classname part. However, when the class name is just a pointer, then this doesn't work, and you need virtuals (assuming the function\_name() is a generic name)
* You don't have to make constructors virtual because you always need to say the specific class name in a constructor

I hope this helps, and I didn't get anything wrong. Let me know if you have more questions or if something didn't make sense!",1,1748238523.0,cs2b,2,1.0,False

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job and I travel a lot. I suppose it’s a good life, I don’t brag but I’ve been told that. It drives me insane because I’m always busy. I guess busy is good.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

I was glad to see a washout especially with the context of prior mental health concerns but was any anybody else a little caught off guard, mildly saddened by the immediate dismissal of Badger from the show? It feels like they got a lot of us rooting for him just to dismiss him with minimal acknowledgement. I nearly completely missed his disappearance because I was cooking while watching and was confused for several episodes.

I recognize that he makes a reappearance in the episode i've reached, but is there any more screen time of him in later seasons or is this the only time i'll see him again? relatively unrelated but it felt very validating to see someone with a larger body type portraying a police role without the whole ""donuts and coffee"" perspective.

They ask me every day to go out for a walk even around the block or walk the dog with them or have a coffee or anything and I always say no and I can see them getting sad . They used to not go out If I didn't want to as well (because even if the relationship sounds problematic on my part we are extremely in love and wanna spend every waking moment together we are the type of couple that is constantly together) but I've managed to have them go out sometimes on their own with the dog or their acquaintances and to events they like so I feel better about that but they still want to spend as much time as they can with me and they ask me every day to go do things but I don't want to and it's kind of difficult for me (everything is kind of difficult for me but also at the same time not enough).
 I'm afraid I will lose them very soon I feel useless I can't spend quality time with them like they want I can't contribute anything substantial financially or in housework ... thoughts or questions or anything?

1kvmq5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaptainAmerica/comments/1kvmq5o/sam_wilsonmcu_should_be_a_mutant_heres_why/,Sam Wilson(MCU) Should Be A Mutant. Here's Why:,"Sam should be a mutant.

""But you're just giving him a different super soldier serum"" No I'm not. Sam is **Sam**. He's not a Human Trial, he's not an enraged trauma-afflicted soldier with PTSD, he's not a Wakandan King. He's himself, authentically.

That is what Sam's story has been trying to be. To be himself, AND be Captain America.

Making Sam a mutant would open a billion different angle for VERY interesting stories for when Marvel decides to bring in the MCU Mutants instead of the Fox mutants.

Imagine:  
A porch overlooking the woods at Sam's sister's house. Sam is drinking a cup of coffee, with the shield not far away from him. It never is.

He scrolls on his phone and he sees: ""CAPTAIN AMERICA A MUTANT! IS THE WORLD READY?"" and he scrolls farther to see comments, and video clips of people saying ""\*\*\*\* those muties"" or something or the other.

\--

Sam's situation was discovered when he donated to a charitable blood drive, and the hospitals found out that his blood was the \*true\* universal recipient and receiver. (AKA ""thing that doesn't exist"") and Sam can donate blood to literally anyone that has blood.

Thus, this caused the desire to test for the X-Gene, and he found out he had it, thus branding himself a Mutant, for better or for worse.

//

What sorts of stories could you tell with a Captain America who not only is Black, but is also a Mutant?

Whatever it is, for the first movie at least, the fact that Cap is a mutant needs to be the center of focus for the story.

The amount of stories the MCU could tell with a Mutant Captain America is so much more than they currently have with Sam's current standing.

Making him a mutant, you can handwave any time something is mildly inconsistent with like, ""eh, he has a low-level durability adaptability for the situation at hand"" (basically sci-fi jargon to say he's as durable as the plot needs him to be)

But beyond that, CAPTAIN AMERICA being a mutant just opens up a billion different stories, all of which could be very interesting.

Or instead of a blood mutation, give Sam Avikinesis - The ability to control/talk to birds. It brings in the possibility for a Mutant Bird to show up and we get Organic Bird Redwing",0,1748237903.0,CaptainAmerica,1,0.38,False

Brian: Ay wala ako noon! Share ko lang kasi INC ako. 

My opinions on this matter: Questioning someone's faith with the intention to shame them is rude. If it's questions based on curiosity and to learn more about other's people's belief, basta phrased in a right way, there's nothing wrong with that.

1kvmk35,https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/1kvmk35/sig_report_from_rid/,Sig Report from RID,"Prior to the Retail Investor Day, I had become pessimistic about my investment in Microvision, especially after the Q1 Earnings Call which I felt was as bad as the 2024 Q1 EC.  The night before RID I had dinner with seven other large investors, most of whom post frequently on this message board, and we openly discussed our thoughts and frustrations with the company to date.  I personally felt that with the current stock price floundering around at $1 and convertible debt payments resuming in September with the conversion price at $1.59 and High Trails having the option to demand cash payments, substantial additional dilution would be required over the next 18 months that would result in a stock price per billion $ of market cap valuation at half or less of where it is today.  At 61 years old and with a large percentage of my assets invested in Microvision, I was becoming very stressed.

Several large investors attending RID were staying at a different hotel about four blocks from the venue of the meeting.  Prior to leaving for the meeting venue, I was having breakfast with u/Speeeeedislife and my pessimism quickly started changing to optimism.  Anubhav walked through the dining area to the coffee bar and when he walked back into the main lobby area, he was quickly joined by Drew, Glen, and a couple young guys finely dressed in blue suits - I quickly told Speed these were investment bankers and explained how I could recognize these IB teams from my previous public company Board experience.  Very soon, u/KY_Investor and his two Kentucky investor friends walked down to the lobby and when they saw the Microvision Executives, walked up to them to say high and learned the young guys were with Deutsche Bank.  So why did that make me optimistic?  These IB teams only meet with companies to sell their representation services for specific reasons - IPOs/Offerings, M&A, and licensing or selling of IP/assets.  Investment Banks like Deutsche Bank don't do low single digit stock offerings (like the current $1) and they aren't interested in small dollar representation fees (fees are usually a percentage of deal with a dollar value floor) - in my prior capacity as a Board member and Audit Committee Chair we had hired multiple IBs, both for IPO and out-licensing IP/drugs and one of these IB hires was Deutsche Bank.

At the RID venue, there were three interaction opportunities with Sumit - informal interactions of investors gathered around Sumit during the tech demonstrations, the official Q&A with Sumit/Anubhav/Glen on stage, and a later social gathering in the evening attended by Sumit at a restaurant/bar.  I won't repeat all of the great questions and answers already reported by other investors on our message board, but I do want to point out a few specific things of importance to me.  Sumit is confident in at least two Industrial wins/partners this year with at least one by September.  Both Sumit and Anubhav separately referred to upcoming announcements causing a ""short squeeze"" with Anubhav mentioning ""asymmetrical price increase opportunity"" due to our institutional investor level and ""eyeballs on our stock"" at least twice.  Both Sumit and Anubhav were optimistic that the Executive Incentive Plan stock price levels that expire in approximately seven months are still at least partially obtainable even though the stock price is currently at $1.  The entire Military commentary and questioning was interesting to me in aggregate (including Anubhav repeatedly saying that the $30-50mm of sales over 12-18 months is ""industrial only and does not include military"").  It appears to me there is much more certainty to this new Military vertical than they are saying now.  I think we will know much more about military opportunities before the end of this year!

I believe the greatest value to attending Microvision RID is more what you see and less what you hear.  Seeing our Executives with a team from a well-known IB at a different venue was telling (my optimism level would be much less without that confirmation) and other attending investors learned there were similar meetings with teams from two other IBs in the afternoon after RID concluded.  You might even catch a glimpse of one of these young investment bankers' laptop screens while they are sitting in a hotel public area - I'll just say that I think these IBs are 'over the wall' - a term meaning they have a full look at insider information.  I also need to point out how at ease and confident Sumit was in every interaction - much different than when he is talking to investors virtually during an EC.  Sumit 'wears his emotions on his sleeve' (I have even heard him say that) and he definitely was not feeling stress at RID.  All four Executives were calm and confident, different from the 2023 RID when I sensed the three then were a little nervous.

In summary, I think we will get some good industrial news that is already queued up (more than one) and that management believes this news will drive up the stock price so that they can raise funding at an attractive stock price for investors.  The IBs are likely preparing/scripting for that now - the only other reason for their current activity with Microvision in my opinion would be for some type of M&A - either a vertical or the entire company which I would also take.  I now think retail investors will have an exit opportunity this calendar year at a minimum price of high-single-digits.  If Microvision funds the company well at that higher price, it may once again be a tough decision to sell with the news we have at that time.",27,1748237287.0,MVIS,5,1.0,False

They served the mixed ingredients together to plates for their party. Water, tea, and coffee was secured from the Enterprise’s replicators and passed around.

“The plan is to sail down the river and cross to get to the road,” said Jack. “Bea will have to come up with wheels so we can roll the rest of the way to the Hangar, or to the city.”

“The river is too deep for the poles,” pointed out Markus. “Once we push out from the shore on this side, we’ll be at the mercy of the current until we get close to the other side.”

“We have options to overcome that,” said Jack. “We have Josie who probably has someone she can use to move us across the river. We have Laura and Bea who can pull the raft between the two of them. And I have a couple of personas I can use. The main problem is going to be the wood for axles and wheels.”

“Why will that be a problem?,” asked Budd.

“We’re heading into farmland, and the trees will be cleared,” said Jack. “Which means Bea will have to look around for what she needs.”

“You could remake the raft into a cart,” said Josie. She sipped her third cup of coffee and felt much more alert and ready for the day.

“But I’m not since this is something Bea will have to be ready to do when she is an adventurer and shepherding her party along so they don’t die a messy death in some backwoods somewhere,” said Jack. “Don’t die on the job, Bea. Josie will cry.”

“I want something grand for my stone,” said Beatrice. “Hawk Ridge’s favorite daughter would be good in my opinion.”

“I’m thinking somebody’s beloved,” said Jack.

“My beloved,” said Budd.

“Do you know where we have to leave the river?,” asked Josie.

“The map says about four miles down the way,” said Jack. He bit into a bagel. “Then we have to go east to meet up with the North South road. We will be below where we recovered Bea after she had been poisoned.”

“All right,” said Josie. “Wait. What map? And where did you get a bagel when none of us have one?”

“What bagel?,” asked Jack. He shoved the last little piece in his mouth. He chewed on the bread as his partner squinted at him. “This map.”

“Don’t talk with your mouth full,” said Josie. She frowned as he pulled his phone and showed her a map of the area around them. “Where did you get that?”

“Mapquest,” said Jack. He grinned at her frowning face.

“You’re about to get punched in the face,” said Josie.

“You asked,” said Jack. “I even have directions.”

Josie looked up at the sky. She closed her eyes. She took a breath.

“What do we need to do to get back on the road?,” said Josie. She looked around their campsite.

“You guys police up the mess, and I will get the raft back in the water,” said Jack. “Then we’ll see how far we can get before lunch time.”

He walked back toward where he had left the raft blocking access to their camp from the river. The whistling song of the Dwarves escaped him as he walked along with his hands in his pockets.

He called on the Hulk to push the raft over so it fell in the water. He pulled it up so they could just push it in the water and go. He thought they could get home before sundown as long as they didn’t run into problems on the road.

Things had been smooth so far. He hoped that would continue so the trip could be marked as a success so they could do it again. He looked around as the Hulk vanished.

He hoped Josie would be happy with Markus for as long as they were together.

He hoped the adventurer didn’t do anything that would lead to being set on fire by lightning from on high.

“We’re ready to go,” said Elaine. She stepped out of the trees, looking up and down the river.

“We have a lot of time before the sun goes down,” said Jack. He looked up at the sky. “We’ll be racing the light at some point. We might have another night on the road.”

“That won’t be so bad,” said Elaine. “Everybody weathered this much of it fairly well.”

“Here comes the girls,” said Jack. “Look innocent. They’ll think we’re up to something.”

“What you like to get up to is not age appropriate,” said Elaine.

“I wouldn’t go that far,” said Jack. “But we’ll see where we land when the sun goes down.”

Josie marched her girls and hangers-on out of the trees. She waved them on the boat. She boarded last, taking care with her footing.

Jack handed out the poles to the three other oarsmen. He took a spot on the near corner closest to the bank.

“I’m going to push hard so we head to the center of the river,” said Jack. “Bea and Laura, we’re going to need you to pull the raft out of the deeper current and close to the other shore. If I push too hard, I’m going to need you to keep us from hitting the other shore and let us drift down to where we have to make landfall.”

“Do you need me to do anything?,” asked Josie.

“Keep an eye out,” said Jack. “If something tries to flip the raft, you are going to have to take care of it.”

“That’s great,” said Josie.

“Everybody, hang on,” said Jack. “I’m going to try to be gentle.”

He took on the Hulk again and braced his pole against the bank. He waited for the girls and friends to lower as much of their center of gravity as they could against the wooden floor of the raft. He flexed his arms just enough to apply pressure to the bank, but not enough to break his pole. He let the persona go as they slid across the river and started sailing down the water.

“I can’t feel anything,” said Jack. “Budd?”

“Nothing but water,” said Budd.

“I can feel a little something,” said Markus. “I can’t get purchase to pull us closer to the shore.”

“Same here, Jack,” said Case.

“Bea, Laura,” said Jack. “Give us a tiny yank so we’ll be closer to the other shore.”

“It should be easy,” said Beatrice. She reached out with Aladdin and pulled them gently out of the center of the river. She smiled at the positioning.

“We’re on target,” said Matilda. “We have two bends and we’ll see our stopping point.”

“Excellent,” said Jack. He checked his normal watch. “We have about five hours until lunch time. Once we reach that point, we’ll stop and eat before trying to reach the Hangar.”

“Gate home for the guys?,” said Josie.

“I don’t see why not,” said Jack. “Naturally they are welcome to eat with us one more time before they do that.”

“Naturally,” said Josie.

Jack started humming the Sloop John B as he watched the river. This side of the water didn’t have as many trees. Pipes reached down to the waterway to divert some of it into the fields he caught glimpses of as they drifted by.

He wondered what they would have to face next. The Society wasn’t just going to let them drift along. He expected a new job before they got back to the Hangar.

He felt ready.

He glanced at the found family that surrounded him. He wondered when he had become the oldest cousin to this outfit of fussy babies. Who else would be added on to their group?

“We just went around the first bend on the map, Jack,” said Matilda, breaking into his fugue. “We’re closing on the second one.”

“Can you point it out?,” asked Jack.

“Not yet,” said Matilda.

“Bea, Laura,” said Jack. “Can you fly ahead with Matilda and pick out where we are supposed to land. We’ll be right behind you, so you won’t be alone for long.”

“I will go with them to keep an eye out for trouble,” said Aviras. “We will secure a landing spot for the rest of us.”

“Good idea,” said Jack. “Make sure nothing happens to the girls, Aviras.”

“I’m on the job,” said Aviras. “Let us go and see our battlefield for ourselves.”

The four of them lifted off into the air. They headed south as he watched.

He saw Josie consider going after her girls and their mascot. He decided to try and get her involved where she was.

Her Ducklings had to fly on their own some time.

“Hey, Jo,” said Jack. “I know we said minimum powers, but could you drag us along a little faster.”

She gave him a look to say she knew what he was doing. He just grinned at her in his bluff frankness. What she could prove was not anything she would get from him.

“I can see what I can do as Aquawoman,” said Josie. “We go down to where the girls are waiting and land?”

“Sure,” said Jack. “We don’t have to go that much faster.”

Josie pushed the button on her watch and turned into water. The raft sped up as something grabbed hold and started pulling them along.

“Pull up poles,” ordered Jack. “Keep an eye out for Matilda and the others. Stay as close to the center as you can until we slow down.”

He nodded as the three adventurers closed on the other passengers in case the raft flipped over. He had an arm around Elaine to steady her.

“She has grown out,” said Elaine.

“She is probably the river,” said Jack.

“Really?,” said Elaine.

“We don’t really know how much the watch can do,” said Jack. He grinned at her. “She might be able to turn into the ocean.”

“You’re joking,” said Elaine.

“Honey Bun,” said Jack. “I promise you we don’t know everything the watches can do. I personally am afraid if we use some of the things that are on them, we might rip this world apart by accident.”

“You could be gods,” said Elaine.

“We could kill ourselves trying,” said Jack. “It’s better to use the smaller stuff and keep things simple instead of trying for a planet eater on the first go when we don’t need it.”

“Mister Warner and June?,” said Elaine.

“I don’t know about Mister Warner, but June isn’t that dangerous yet,” said Jack. “Thank God.”

“That makes me feel much better,” said Elaine.

“Me too,” said Jack.

“We can see you,” said Aviras from his com. “You might want to slow down.”

“I’ll have to call Josie,” said Jack. “She transformed and is piggy backing us. Hold on.”

He changed into Professor X to use the telepathy built into the persona. He reached out with his mind and touched Josie’s. He sent the message they were about to pass the girls so she might want to slow down and head for the shore. He let the persona go when she replied back.

“That was one of the uglier shapes,” said Elaine.

“I know,” said Jack. “Four told me when we raided this guy.”

A wave of water leaped from the river. It hit the top of the raft, splashing the passengers. Josie stood on the wood deck, dry as a fall leaf.

“Poles,” said Jack. He took his place. “We have to push in.”

The four men dug into the riverbed with their poles, pushing to get out of the current. The raft sailed to the riverbank, and then on the grass beyond. Jack rode the impact out with bent knees, catching Elaine around the waist so she wouldn’t fall.

“Everybody off so the girls can turn this into a wagon,” said Jack. He helped Elaine onto shore as he thought about what he could do to turn a wagon into a van to carry everybody home.

He was glad the kids were rising to the challenge. He wouldn’t be there to hold their hands all their lives.

“It was a nice raft,” said Beatrice.

“Can you do something with it?,” asked Laura.

Jack kept an eye on the water. He decided that they should get away from the river. They didn’t want to fight a water serpent while Bea was doing her business.

On the other hand, Josie would probably make short work of anything trying to rush them.

“I don’t know,” said Beatrice. She frowned at the raft. Light surrounded her.

The wood came apart and floated off the ground. Each piece weighed less than the combined total. She reshaped everything, shaving off what she needed for axles and wheels. She put it together gently and let it drop on solid columns that would act for the wheels they needed. She closed her eyes against the sudden release and the loss of power.

Jack smiled as he walked around the new vehicle. He didn’t see any way to get it running, steer it, or make it fly other than Laura taking a hand in everything.

“We now have a rough wagon,” said Aviras. “Can you make it move, welsher?”

“Buddy,” Jack grinned. “There are two things there are no doubt about. Yes, I can make this land wagon move, and tomorrow, you will be green.”

“I think a reddish yellow would be better,” said Alicia.

“The right shade will be hard for me to match,” said Jack.

“More red than yellow would be better in my opinion,” said Alicia. “Now get to work. Sir Harp probably thinks we’re dead.”

“First,” said Josie. “No one is dyeing the dragon any other color than what he is now. Are we clear?”

Jack leaned back. Should he push on this? Alicia looked away from her big sister.

“Are we clear?,” Josie asked in a face punching sort of voice.

“Yes,” said Jack. He liked his face unpunched as much as possible.

“Yes, Missus,” said Alicia. Her tone was still flat, but it had an edge of sullenness.

“Secondly,” said Josie. “I make the terms of the welshing. Understood, Aviras?”

“Yes,” said the dragon. He dropped down so Matilda’s head was in front of any direct blow.

“All right,” said Josie. Her face lightened to her regular grim expression. “How do we get started on this so we can roll the rest of the way home?”

“I just need to make a couple of adjustments,” said Jack. “Most of this is pretty good for a first try.”

“Really?,” asked Beatrice. She frowned at her creation.

“Sure,” said Jack. “The things that need to be fixed are in the engineering part and you don’t know anything about that, and I don’t think Aladdin does either. A little touch-up should take care of things.”

Fast forward to yesterday, they invited my parents to their city and told my parents off - few of the things they told that made my mom cry is as follows:

1. I don’t think they’re happy in this marriage - “Your daughter thinks she’s a queen and my son is her servant”. He always holds their dog while they go out together ( which he loves to btw, I’d happily do it myself ). They said “ your daughter doesn’t like leaving the house, how will my son live with someone like this “. 

I mean, if someone keeps telling you off the second they enter your house. Would anyone want to go out with them? I do go out with my husband, however. 

2. Evening at the wedding thought your daughter was very arrogant - The reason they gave my parents is that “ I didn’t hold my husbands hand while he wanted to hold it in a video “. 

3. I didn’t offer them tea/coffee everyday. They said and I quote “ which sort of a girl doesn’t offer tea “. 

I DONT DRINK TEA!!!! I made all three meals a day, tea was never on the list because it wasn’t something I normally do. 

4. Apparently, I starve their son ( lol ) 

The list goes on and on. Things to note:

1. They never spoke to my husband about any of this because “ they didn’t want to hurt him more “. When I asked my husband about all this, he was as mad as I was. 

2. They stayed with us for 2 days - that’s it.

How do I go about with them as normal after they have invited my partners over and humiliated them to say the least. I can’t ever get myself to speak with them again.

I wanted to get a couple of their products tested because I wanna know what is making them work differently because saying organic and nano technology in one sentence just doesn’t go together. I wanna get simply nano tabs tested just to see what the deal is and it’s been so long. They keep on releasing ones that I’ve asked after that so I have to ask myself. Is this a business now where they’re getting paid to lie or are we getting the true honest results - it’s funny how some companies you wouldn’t expect to get perfect A’s but they do and they also have an F in customer service and an FN logistics and shipping and receiving Tuesday at 2 o’clock I’m being picked up and I’m happily going to detox for 30 days. I’ve never in my life. Felt happy about getting this shit over with when I found 70h after being a long-term opiate addict, I have about eight years off of opiates. I was only taking crayon leaf the first time I tried half a tab of 70HMZ and I remember the feeling of it hitting me and my mind going I’m fucked like I knew it was the beginning. I didn’t know a year later I would be finally realizing that. I’m just prolonging something that has to stop at some point wasting and I looked and I only made purchases from my cash app card 26,000 yep in a year I spent 26,000 and that makes my stomach turn the fact that my gut was torn up from five years of ingesting leaf but then add in the solvent and all the shit that I didn’t even know was in 7oh . It’s definitely on its own level when it comes to categorizing opiates because I went through all the stages and none of them could produce a precipitated panic attack before you even start feeling any physical with all symptoms. That alone is scary and I think that is what makes people not stop because they’re afraid if it’s that bad before it’s supposed to get bad then it’s gonna be brutal but I know that I’ll be in a place that has a PHP license partial hospitalization and I am ready to be miserable until I’m not. I hope this stuff stays on the market. I believe there is amazing benefits to it and I met another person today. Who says I take 14 mg in the morning and that’s it and I just look and I go how and it just can’t make sense of it because it’s like you have to be feeling great especially with your coffee and then it tears up your gut some and then I guess you just if you keep it that low maybe that’s like what I definitely flew right by cause I went to three times a day one in the morning, one for lunch and one for the evening and that was me going. I did a great job then I would go let me just place an order so I can buy a lot more for a lot cheaper that way I’ll save a lot more money and I end up just thinking about celebrating the fact that I got a package that supposed to last so let me take three of them because that’s how I do shit so I’m not a good candidate but if you’re good at selling in person or talking, this is where things changed it been invincible and I sold a lot more cars, and I made a lot more money and I spent a lot more money. I take everything under the sun to combat the box of this like I’m an herbalist I know all about all the parasite, cleanses and diet. I know all that shit. I also know simply by just taking this substance out of my life is going to give me back what I miss. And with the knowledge that I gained since I’ve been on it I know I’m gonna heal. I know that I’m gonna come back better than ever and I know I’m gonna wish I did this a year ago if there’s anyone reading this that is prescribed benzos or is thinking about experimenting with it just know it does not mesh well with Xanax especially Xanax clonazepam totally different night and day difference I was taking Cymbalta in the beginning and I had that pink cloud serotonin syndrome. It had to have been because I was happier than a pig and shit 24 seven every day all day and then I started to notice adverse effects from the generic version so I decided at this point why am I taking this? This is so powerful that I shouldn’t be depressed because I’m numb. I stopped at cold turkey had enough which all feelings that’s one good thing and I won’t go back to antidepressant. That’s all situational for me. The only thing I could say is I’m nervous about the first two days going into it. I don’t even like subs every time I use them to get off opiates, they usually backfire and make me feel like shit. I was on subs for 10 years with 90s Xanax and prescribed 60 Adderall that is like normal in West Palm Beach, Florida all you gotta do is say I have generalized anxiety disorder and I can’t focus and I try opiates and you’ll get all that anyways that we all acid for three months and it was complete hell that’s what stuck in the back of my head and that’s what comes to my mind when I think about quitting, it’s not sleeping. It’s not sleeping for months. Yes, I did not sleep for months. I did not have access to any sleep meds. I detox at a halfway house, listening to people snore all night while I had restless legs, twitching chills, and I guess I called anxiety bombs about every time I felt like I was going to fall asleep, one of those riddle, my body, so it was easy after I made it through that to stay sober for the rest of the time, but after I lost my business, my support or my friends that I got sober with we all worked at the same place and we all lost our jobs at the treatment center because we weren’t gonna work for free for another week. They ended up taking out payday loans just to take care of payroll. I also lost points in the rehab and then was told I need to go find another place to live so basically I was like trap house number one speed dial still there purposely disappeared in a hotel in Delray Beach for a month and a half went through 25K seeing that and I knew right away if I were to blow the rest, I would’ve probably ended it so I hit my knees and I prayed the very next morning. I got into a car accident that stopped it so it also took my license for six years I’m happy that was 10 years ago.. I’d appreciate it if some of you guys just said inside a prayer you don’t have to write nothing just I’m 43 starting over from scratch. I do have a job when I get out. I hope and I’m praying to get off of everything. The place I’m going has been reaching out to me every day. I had to taper down before I went cold turkey like that I wasn’t comfortable with stopping in at 500 mg a day like no in three days, I’m down to 150 and I feel normal but I don’t feel like I’m gonna sleep and I do know where one is in case I have to take it just to get through the night for one more day. I mean the amount of weight that came off of my shoulders when I found out my insurance paid for the entire 30 days and I had everything lined up honestly so much stress left my body. I felt the 70 working again I’m like damn stressed does have an effect on this. I can feel it now. Shit maybe I might call that place up cancel it— hell Naww - if you’re wondering, what do I look like or if you’re wondering what my life looks like you can follow me on Instagram it’s on private so I check yours before I accept it because there’s too many bots and messed up people and if you’re into traveling growing plants are I have about six years of travels on my Instagram shoot me a message. I would be happy to help if you guys have any questions and I will report after I leave there what I experienced at this moment, the only thing I’m not looking forward here is the first two or 3 days I don’t think subs are gonna touch what this monster has in it and then I’m going to be detoxing from benzos because they’re taking me off of mine and they’re giving me volume which is gonna be a minute dose i’m OK with that as well. I’m prepared to suffer and I know they’re gonna try to make it as comfortable as possible. This is my only chance in my eyes. The only thing I am doing is riding down my back up plan in case I do have a bad reaction right away. The only other thing I can think of trying is a high dose of methadone the first day— if anyone has been in this type of situation and can help I would greatly appreciate it my Instagram @peace_ch1ef . Have fun while you guys are young. I’m jealous if I was 21 this would be the message the guy that I’d be like you’re a pussy you need to just dose up and shut up that was me . Man all I got going at this point is a good starter job and training again is making me so excited because I feel like with my knowledge with stem cell therapy and hormones and five methylfolate I have a good chance at completely coming off of everything if I don’t worst case scenario, I go back on the lowest dose possible benzo to where I’m not sweating through my shirt while I’m trying to talk to a woman in public where it’s freezing like that’s the type of anxiety I used to get at three years sober. Fuck that if I get sober I at least wanna be happy and be doing the things I enjoy. I don’t wanna be just spending my money on clothes and food and then get anxiety attacks when I try to go out in public and talk socially when really to a person I can get up and talk to anyone. I have no fear in women that are taller than me. In fact, I give myself brownie points if I ever crawl up a tree . Oh and last and definitely least 7oh will abolish your testosterone.

Now, I don’t smile as much as I’m just mentally drained all the time.

I’m coming to the point in life where I’m realizing how crappy people are friends, family, and relationships. Everyone works so selfishly there is no care about people. I’ve noticed I always go out of my way to help people and now am realizing no one does the same thing back.

My girl friends are at stages where they are all male centered. Literally get dumped by one guy and the next week they are onto to someone else. All of them love attention - man buys them coffee and boy they say that man is the life of their life but none of them are trying to make deep meaningful connections with said partner. People have asked me why aren’t you dating and I say the same thing. Im looking for someone to add to my life not take away from it. Maybe im just tired of everything

People say they are unhappy in life and do nothing to change it. People love staying in cycles and it really burns me out to have the same conversation all the time …there unhappy or this person did them wrong the list goes on and on.. 

I’m just tired of it all. That girl that use to care about people is dying and I don’t know what to do about it.

For those that are older, could you give some advice? Does this feeling last forever?

She always wore it. The thin chain kept the heart-shaped locket pressed to the hollow of her throat. Her braid of brown hair fell off her right shoulder and down the front of her conservative dress. My mom always wore the most conservative dress. She was such a fifties housewife, staying at home, keeping everything clean, being subservient to [dad.Like](http://dad.Like) always subservient. She would fetch him beers when he watched TV after work and always made sure his coffee was topped off during breakfast. Every day when he came home from work, Mom would be waiting for him, ready to take his jacket and massage his feet.And she did it with a smile on her face. She loved my dad. And I didn’t blame him. He was a handsome man, tall, dark-haired, and muscular. Sometimes he made my body ache with desires and I would have to masturbate in my room hoping my twin sister Alice didn’t notice.Now Alice and I weren’t identical twins but fraternal. We looked as much alike as any other normal set of sisters. She was taller and slimmer than I was but my breasts were bigger and my hair finer. It fell in a similar braid to my mother’s down my back, almost the same shade of brown.“Mom, we’re going to be late,” Alice shouted from the car, her head shoved through, her bushy, tawny hair spilling about her delicate face. We both inherited Mom’s small nose and delicate cheekbones, making us look fragile and innocent.“In a moment, dear,” my mom shouted, always full of patience. She turned to me and stroked my hair. “While I’m gone it will be up to you to take care of him, okay. Be obedient and a good girl. I know you will be. You love being a good girl for your daddy.”My cheeks warmed. Ever since I realized that my dad was a muscular hunk beneath the dress shirts he wore for his office job, I found myself wanting to do whatever he said, running errands, fetching him drinks, doing things Mom normally did for him so I could be around him. It made my heart almost float out of my chest when I did.I just wanted to be close to my dad. I was a daddy’s girl, but so were lots of my friends. My friends, including my best friend Sun, were all jealous that I had the cutest dad.Alice, on the other hand, was a brat. I was glad she was going with Mom to Grandma’s. Three weeks of just me and Dad while Mom helped Grandma adjust after Grandpa’s hip surgery. I could have gone, but it was my choice to stay.And I would get to spend so much time with Daddy. So of course I declined. It was so boring at Grandma’s. I loved her and Grandpa, I did, but there was nothing to do there but be board. They barely had internet and no cable, just rabbit ears on a black and white TV.“I’ll be good for Dad,” I smiled.She sighed. “You don’t call him Daddy anymore. I get it, you’re getting older, but it always made him happy when you call him Daddy.”“It does?” I asked, a hot thrill shooting through me. Daddy. It felt so naughty to call him that at my age. I squirmed my hips, my nipples hardening in my bra.She nodded her head. “Now you be good. Do everything he tells you. Eighteen is not too old to be spanked over your father’s knee.”I blushed. Once, I had seen Dad spanking Mom a few weeks ago. They were in their bedroom, but the door had been cracked. It was Saturday and my sister and I were supposed to be weeding the garden. I slipped in to change my clothes—my tight shorts were proving impractical to moving—and heard the slaps. At first, I thought dad was hurting her until I glimpsed her face.Mom loved to be spanked.The image rose in my mind. My mother naked, her large breasts pressing against Dad’s muscular thigh, her round bottom red and wiggling as he slammed his broad hand on her flesh. Her head had risen with each spanking, her toes curling. I caught a glimpse between her legs. She was shaved and looked so youthful. And with her hair braided, she seemed more like a little girl being spanked by her daddy than a wife playing with her husband.I had only watched for a minute before I was so afraid I ran. I burst into my bedroom, shoved my hands down my shorts, and rubbed at my pussy lips. I was so wet. I had never masturbated with such a frenetic need as I pictured Dad’s muscular chest, covered in barbwire tattoos, rippling as he drew back his arm and spanked me.“Melody,” my mother said, bringing me out of my fantasy. “You are going to behave, right?”“I’ll be Daddy’s good girl,” I smiled.“Good.” Dad’s voice rumbled behind me.Startled, I let out a squeak and turned around, my hands clasped before me as Dad, wearing a plain, white t-shirt that molded to his muscles, walked up. Mom lowered her head and clasped her hands before her. Dad stopped before her, ignoring me, and raised her chin.“Dear,” Mom said, “Melody has promised to take care of you while I am gone. I hope she will be a satisfactory replacement.”“Once I have her trained,” Dad answered, his thumb brushing her cheeks.“Good.” A smile played on Mom’s lips. “Then, with your permission, dear, I would like to go and visit my parents.”“Granted.”Permission? Why did Mom need permission?Dad seized Mom’s lips in a kiss. My eyes widened at the unbridled passion. Mom shuddered, her eyes closed while Dad owned her lips. He still held her chin as he kissed her. She moaned, her hips shuddering, her hands squeezed tight together. And then he broke it. Mom took a deep breath, her cheeks flushed.Daddy's GirlDaddy's Girl“I love you, dear.”Dad nodded, his thumb still caressing her cheek, an intimate touch. Wild thoughts of Dad touching me like that spilled through my mind. A heat ignited between my thighs, wet, molten passion. The urge to run upstairs and masturbate seized me as Dad patted Mom’s ass as she walked away, a laugh on her lips and a saucy look in her eyes.They were so affectionate.“Well,” Dad said, staring down at me. He cupped my chin and lifted my eyes. Would he kiss me now? “It is just me and you. Your Mother promises me you will behave.”“Of course ... Daddy.”His lips twitched, a smile almost forming. “Good.” He kissed me on my forehead instead of my lips. My flesh burned where he touched me. I shuddered. “Go fetch me a beer, the game’s about to start.”“Yes, Daddy.” My heart beat in my chest as I turned and raced to the kitchen.I thought I felt Dad’s eyes on my ass. I wore an old pair of jeans—I was supposed to go school shopping with Mom and Alice tomorrow—and they were tight. They hugged my rear and legs. I had grown since I bought them.I hoped he was watching. It made me feel so womanly. Mom was gone. It was my place to be the woman of the house and make sure the man was taken care of.My teachers at school would be horrified. Especially Ms. Gardner and Mrs. Thompson. They were always talking about how women didn’t have to serve men and being a housewife was “internalized misogyny.” But it was nice to serve. It made me happy.What was so wrong with that?Nothing.Of course, I never contradicted my teachers. And I never told them about my mother. She was almost straight out of the ancient TV show that sometimes appeared on Nickelodeon late at night—Leave it to Beaver. But she wasn’t faking her happiness. She was always humming and singing as she cooked or clean.“Your father earns the money and provides for us,” she would say, “and he works hard to do it. So I work just as hard at home making our life pleasant. Your father appreciates what I do, and I appreciate what he does. We compliment each other.”Hearing her say it made it sound like the most romantic thing in the world.My head buzzed with images of me being Daddy’s wife. Cooking and cleaning, waiting for him to come home, then I would massage his feet after his hard day while we talked. They always laughed when Mom massaged his feet. It was their private time. Alice and I were banished to our bedrooms or elsewhere during it.I brought the beer to Daddy.“Thank you, Melody,” he said, taking it and giving me a nod.“You’re welcome, Daddy,” I smiled.He patted the arm of his recliner while the announcer called the baseball game. The Mariners were playing the A’s, and the first pitch had just been thrown. I sat on the chair’s arm and leaned back, Daddy’s arm going around my waist.It was wonderful. I smiled, loving being near him even if it meant watching a boring baseball game. Twice more he sent me to get him another beer. I returned with his drink and diet cokes for myself. I even started getting into the game, and when the Mariners won, Daddy hugged me to his chest.He smelled so manly. The hot itch returned to me. I squirmed, my cheeks burning, suddenly so embarrassed. “I have to go make dinner, Daddy.”“Okay, sweetheart.” He kissed me on the forehead.I crawled off the recliner, my thighs squeezed tight. I really did have to start dinner, but I wanted to masturbate so badly. “Daddy, Mom was supposed to take me clothing shopping tomorrow.”“I’ll take you.” his eyes fell on mine. So strong. “But you won’t buy anything without my approval.”Part of me wanted to revolt. What did my dad know about clothes? He would probably try to dress me like Mom. Long skirts, loose blouses, nothing to show off my growing body. I liked to dress in tight jeans, short shorts, and daring skirts. But I had promised to be a good girl for Daddy.“Okay, Daddy.”“Good girl,” he smiled.My heart thudded for joy.Daddy’s GirlDaddy’s GirlI was so tired the next morning. I couldn’t sleep last night. Thoughts of taking over all of Mom’s duties for Daddy filled my thoughts. I had rubbed my poor pussy raw masturbating last night. But I couldn’t stop. The idea gripped me. Massaging his feet, stripping him naked, laying beneath him as he pumped his cock in and out of me.I knew about sex. Several of my friends had had sex, and they told me all about how disappointing the boys were the first times. “I wish I had a man do it,” they all said. “Someone older and sexier. Like your Dad, Melody.”“I would totally let your dad pop my cherry,” Sun had giggled.“Older men know how to get the job done,” Tiffany had proclaimed. “Trust me.”“Every girl knows it,” agreed Donna. “But good luck finding an older man that isn’t a perv. He needs to be perfect. I bet your Dad would be perfect. Maybe I should spend the night.”I had said no. There was no way I was letting Donna near my dad, not with the hungry look in her eye.Now my thoughts were consumed with him. We were all alone. Three times I stood up and walked to my bedroom door, set on walking down the hall and slipping into bed with Daddy. But it was also so scary. I wanted him so badly, but incest was wrong. He wouldn’t want to sleep with me and cheat on Mom.He was a good man not a pervert.The third time I had stood at my door, gripping the nub, my stomach twisting. I listened. The house was so quiet. I strained to hear him in his bedroom. I imagined him awake, burning with desires for me, waiting for me to come and perform Mom’s wifely duties with him.But I chickened out and ran back to my bed. And then masturbated to another orgasm.I almost overslept and forgot to make Daddy breakfast. But I remembered at the last minute and rushed downstairs wearing only my thin nightgown. I whipped up Sunday breakfast and had it ready when Daddy came down at his usual 8 AM.It was after breakfast he took me to the mall. I held his arm as we walked through the mall. I noticed the other girls and women who looked at them and a prideful surge went through him. He was desired but he was mine.Until Mom got back.I led Daddy to the first store, pulling him past the shoplifting detectors and into the vibrant clothing store. Everywhere I looked were frilly, feminine items. Daddy was the opposite of it all, standing tall, muscular, hunky.“I only want you to buy skirts,” Daddy said. “I like my girls in skirts.”“Is that why Mom never wears jeans or pants?”Daddy nodded. “And you’re at that age where you should do the same.”“But long skirts, like Mom? Hers are so boring.”A smile crossed his lips. “Sweetheart, buy the shortest, tightest skirts you want. You have gorgeous legs. Let Daddy see them.”Heat rushed up my legs. “Yes, Daddy,” I squeaked then turned away, my cheeks on fire. Daddy wanted to see my legs. I wish I was wearing a skirt right now instead of stupid shorts.There were so many wonderful skirts. Short tennis skirts, pleated skirts, pencil skirts, flowery skirts, knee-length skirts, mid-thigh skirts, even shorter ones. I felt so daring when I grabbed on of those, imagining it only falling past my rear and not much else. It would show off so much of my legs. Daddy didn’t complain as I handed him another skirt to hold. He threw them over his muscular arms, a patient smile on his lips as he glanced at what I bought.I liked flashy skirts with bright colors, drawing the eye.And then I had to find blouses to go with them. We headed across the store where I snagged halter tops, peasant blouses, V-necks, scoop necks, baby doll t-shirts, belly shirts. With each one I considered which bottom it would go with, making my outfit plans. This top could go with three different skirts, bu this one only went with one. I took the top that could match three skirts.Variety. I needed to mix up my clothing. I couldn’t wear the same outfit combinations all the time.With a dozen blouses and skirts chosen, I headed into the back for the changing rooms. “I can’t wait to see how pretty you look,” Daddy said as I closed the door.My cheeks blushed. I looked out the louvered slats. I could sort of see through them from my side, glimpsing his legs in his blue jeans while I pulled off the t-shirt I wore. A sudden surge of excitement went through me as I wiggled out of my shorts.I was almost naked in here and Daddy was just on the other side.I grabbed a knee-length skirt and a halter top that went well with it, adjusting my bra. I would have to get a strapless bra to wear with the halter top, my straps were too obvious. I stared at myself in the mirror, turning, loving how my braid of dark-brown hair fell down my back, almost reaching the soft swell of my rear. The skirt fell lovely across my butt. I shifted my hips, loving how the hem swayed about my legs.“You dressed yet?”“Coming, Daddy,” I giggled. “You need to be patient when girls are trying on clothing.”“I’m not good at patience. I like to take what I want.”A hot wave rushed through me. I almost said, “You can take me, Daddy,” but that would be absolutely stupid.I stepped out, standing before him, suddenly so afraid. What if he hated it. His arms folded before him, his eyes studying me as I fidgeted. I played with my fingers before him, wishing he would say something.“Straighten your back,” he said. “And turn around. Let me get a good look at you.”Daddy's GirlDaddy's Girl“Yes, Daddy,” I said, my spine snapping straight. Then I turned, putting a little sway into my hips to really make the skirt swirl. “Do you ... like it, Daddy?”“The skirt’s a little long,” he said, “but your top is great. We’ll need to get you a strapless bra. Unless you already own one?”“I don’t, Daddy.”“We’ll fix that.”I swallowed then reached for the door and opened it. I slipped in. Only the door didn’t close behind me right away. I turned and gasped as Daddy stood in there with me, his arms folded, his eyes on me as I clutched the next top.“Well, this will be faster,” he nodded, his eyes rolling up and down my body. “You won’t have to keep coming and going.”“I ... I don’t think it’s allowed for you to be in here, Daddy,” I trembled.“I don’t care.” His eyes were so dark and commanding. “Now change. Show me your next lovely outfit.”“Yes, Daddy.”I hastened to obey him. I pulled off the halter top. I felt so naked in just my bra, cupping my round breasts. My nipples were so hard, poking at the front. I don’t know why. I had worn my bikini around Daddy before and it showed just as much flesh. I wiggled out of my skirt, bending over to step out of it and pointing my panty-clad rear at Daddy.“Cute pair,” he said. “Black. I like them.”“Black? What...” My panties. My cheeks burned even more and the hot itch between my thighs swelled. “Thank you, Daddy.”“You’re growing up so fast.”I straightened and pulled on a red, V necked blouse and turned to face him.His cock bulged the front of his jeans. I froze, half-pulling on the top, my right arm through the sleeve, my left arm searching for the armhole. I sucked in a deep breath. Daddy was turned on right now.I turned him on.“Keep changing,” he ordered. “Don’t stop. I need to approve all your outfits.”“D-do you approve all of Mom’s?”“Why do you think I take her shopping? Your mother dresses to please me. She’s a good girl. And I know you want to be just like her, another good girl for Daddy.”“I do,” I whispered. I pulled the top over my head and pulled my braid out the back. Then I grabbed a jean skirt I thought would be quite cute with this top. I stepped into the skirt, pulling it up my hips. It was tight. I sucked in a breath to get it up over me and then zipped up the side. It fell to my mid-thigh, a few artfully worn through spots showing off my pale thighs beneath.Daddy nodded his head as I turned. “Now bend over,” he ordered. “Touch your toes.”“Yes, Daddy.”I knew I had to do it with my ass facing him. I bent over, the skirt sliding up my thighs, revealing more and more of my flesh. I almost wished it was short enough to flash my panties at Daddy. The hot itch between my legs grew even hotter. I had to be wet, my panties soaking up my excitement.I wanted to escape to a bathroom and masturbate.“D-do you like them?” A tremble ran through me.“They are perfect. You have great taste in clothing.” His hand stroked my bare thigh right beneath the hem of my skirt. I shuddered and moaned, the blood rushing to my head as I stayed bent over. What was he doing. “Just perfect. Okay, try on the next.”My virgin body trembled as I turned. I could still feel his hand on my thigh even though he stopped touching me. It was the most intimate contact I had ever had with another person. I didn’t date much—Daddy didn’t approve and, unlike Alice, I was a good girl. I had barely kissed a boy let alone let one really touch me.It was amazing to feel his hand on me. As I stripped down to my underwear, I wanted Daddy to touch me again.I grabbed the one very short skirt I selected. I had never worn a miniskirt before. It was made of a stretchy, black material that hugged my ass when I pulled it on. It felt so exposed. It ended right below my butt-cheek. As I pulled on a purple belly skirt with dangling, golden fringes around the hem, I felt like at any moment the skirt would slide up my flesh and expose my panties.“Now that is a skirt,” Daddy said, as I faced him, the tasseled fringes caressing my belly and back as they swayed. “Yes, it is. Turn around. Let me see your ass.”“Yes, Daddy.”I turned, so aware that I was turning him on. He groaned. His hands reached out, touching me. It was so wrong. No father should touch his daughter like that, especially not when she was underage, but I didn’t care. It was so wonderful. His hands so strong as they squeezed me.“That’s my good girl,” he whispered as his hands kneaded me. “Mmm, you’re making Daddy so happy. Now bend over. Let’s see how this skirt moves.”“Yes, Daddy.”My pussy clenched as I bent over. He let go of my ass as I did. I gasped when I pressed back into his cock bulging his jeans. I felt it along the top of my ass as I bent over, my braid falling to the floor. I fought the urge to grind back against him. My pussy was so itchy. I wanted to be touched.Needed to be touched.I didn’t care if it was my Daddy doing the touching.That would just make it hotter.“What a gorgeous skirt,” he groaned, gripping my hips. He moved, sliding his bulge up and down against my ass, moving it lower. It pressed against my pussy. I felt him through all our clothing. So big. So thick. Was he bigger than a normal guy? What would he feel like in me?Incestuous passions gripped me. I wanted my father to fuck me right here, right now.“Melody, kneel,” he ordered, grinding harder against me.”“Kneel?”His hand smacked on my ass. I yelped as the burning pain shot through me. I didn’t understand why that made my pussy even warmer. “I gave you an order. What happens when girls are bad.”“We’re spanked, Daddy.”He rubbed my ass where his hand landed. “Well?”I spun around and knelt before him, the thin carpet of the changing room rough on my knees. I stared up at him. He seemed even taller than usual. The changing room’s light shone above his head, making him a dark shadow.“You’ve made me hard,” he continued. “You’ve excited me. Good girls take care of the problems they create.”I stared at his cock, my eyes widening. “I ... What are you wanting me to do, Daddy?” This couldn’t be happening. This really couldn’t. We were in the changing room. I know I was horny and wanted my Daddy, but they were just fantasies.Incestuous, forbidden fantasies.Daddy’s GirlDaddy’s Girl“I am telling you to pull out my cock and suck it until I cum. You will swallow every drop. If you don’t, I will spank you so hard when we get home.” His hand reached out and seized my braid. “You promised to be a good girl, Melody.”“I did, Daddy.” I licked my lips, staring at his bulge. “But ... but ... what about Mom?”“What about her? She’s not here. You are. What will it be, young lady?”Another wave of heat washed through me. “I’ll be good, Daddy.”My hands trembled as they reached for the zipper of his jeans. I had never sucked a cock before. I had only heard my friends whispering and giggling about it. I needed to watch my teeth, use my tongue. Lick it and suck it.The zipper rasped as I pulled it down. His cock pressed at the open fly, tenting a pair of dark-blue boxers. My breath quickened as I reached up and hooked my fingers in the waistband. I froze. I couldn’t believe this was happening.Daddy seized my braid. “Do you want a spanking, young lady?”His stern voice compelled me. I would be a good girl for Daddy. I hauled them down. His dick popped out, bouncing before me. A flick of something wet splattered my cheek. It was warm. More juices leaked out of the tip of his cock.“Lick the precum up then suck,” he growled, still holding on to my braid.I leaned forward and licked.Daddy groaned as my tongue slid across his warm, spongy tip. Then I reached the drop of clear fluid—his precum. It didn’t have much flavor, a little salty. Not bad at all. An erotic thrill went through me as I licked again. And again.I was blowing my Daddy’s cock.My lips opened wider. I sucked the tip into my mouth. My tongue explored it as I remembered my friend’s words. I sucked, my lips forming a tight seal, my cheeks pulling inward. Daddy groaned again, louder.I pleased him. I made him hard and I would be a good girl and take care of his erection. Mommy wasn’t here to do it.My hands seized his cock. He felt so huge in my grip. I stroked my fists up and down his shaft, brushing my lips. His dick throbbed with his heart beat, pulsing with his passion. I stared up at Daddy and his shadowed face.“That’s it,” he panted. “Melody, you’re being such a good girl for Daddy.”I sucked harder. I fisted him faster. My tongue swirled circles about the tip as more and more of his precum filled my mouth. My head bobbed. I took more of his cock into my mouth. Daddy loved it. His hand pulled on my braid, encouraging me.My hips shifted. My pussy was so wet. I bet there was a big wet spot. When I masturbated tonight, I would relive this over and over, remembering every taste and smell. When I breathed in, I smelled his musk. It was intense, rising out of his thick, dark curls.“Such a good girl,” he groaned. “And good girls swallow every drop.”I moaned a yes about his dick. Daddy was about to cum. My right hand, curious, left his cock and found his heavy balls. They were thick, swelling his sack. His cum filled them. In a moment, his jizz would feel my mouth.I massaged them, eager for the treat. I didn’t care if this was wrong. My Daddy told me to do something, and I would do it. I was his good girl.“My good girl,” he echoed. My heart fluttered and my virgin pussy clenched every time he said. “My good, wonderful girl.”His hips thrust forward, pushing his cock to the back of my throat. Then he drew back while I sucked. He growled. His balls twitched. His hand tightened on my braid as his cum squirted into my mouth.I gasped at the force of the first blast of jizz splashing at the back of my throat. It was thick and salty. And then a second and third blast followed. I moaned, shocked at how hard he erupted and how much flowed into my mouth. More and more pumped into me, overflowing my mouth.I had to swallow. I gulped. Daddy’s seed poured down my throat and warmed my belly. I swallowed again and again. It was so salty, but not terrible. It was my daddy’s, and that made it better. He grunted with each blast, his head tossing back, the light illuminating the primal passion crossing his face.And then he grunted the last time. “Mmm, so good. Melody, you did a great job giving you first blowjob.”His cock pulled from my mouth. “Thank you, Daddy.” Then I realized some of his cum trickled down my chin. My eyes widened. “I’m sorry, Daddy, I really did my best to swallow all your jizz.”He laughed and pulled on my braid. I winced and stood. “Sweetheart, your mother can’t always contain my flood, either. I know you swallowed as much as you could. But let’s get you cleaned up.” He knelt before me and reached beneath my miniskirt. He yanked down my panties. The hot, tart musk of my pussy filled my nose. He chuckled again. “Someone’s excited.”He held up my panties. A dark spot soaked the material even darker. I blushed as he reached out and wiped my face clean. I smelled my pussy even stronger. I had the sudden urge to taste myself. I had always been curious, but chickened out licking the juicy crotch.Daddy pocketed the panties in his jeans and said, “Well, let’s continue.”Daddy loved the rest of my outfits. He told me to wear the miniskirt and belly shirt and we headed to the counter to pay. I was so aware I didn’t have panties on beneath. Cool, air-conditioned breezes swirled up my legs and caressed my bare lips. I trembled as Daddy paid, my hands constantly pulling down the skirt, making sure I didn’t show anything.Daddy noticed. It amused him.I had to walk in front of Daddy on the way to the lingerie store to buy me new bras and panties. Every time I glanced back, he had a hungry smile on my lips, his eyes locked on my ass. My cheeks burned. My pussy leaked excitement. I felt the juices trickled down my thighs. People had to notice.It was so embarrassing. But Daddy wanted me to do it. Even though my cheeks burned with shame, I was also so horny. I could explode at the slightest touch.

1kvmb8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeeshopowners/comments/1kvmb8d/spare_espresso_machine/,Spare Espresso Machine?,"Hello, my daughter is in the planning and looking for location stage for a small cafe.  I have an idea for the espresso machine, and would like to get reactions and critiques.

As we know, commercial espresso machines are expensive ($5,000?) and when they fail, your shop is largely shut down until you can get a service company to come and repair it.

Well, I have a mini-hobby of refurbishing older commercial espresso machines.  For simplicity I stick to one brand, “Elektra”, and to one older model family.   These are typical Italian commercial machines that you’d have seen on espresso bars back 20-30 years ago, more so in Italy though.  11 liter boilers, heat exchangers, 230v, mechanical pressure-stat, old school stuff.  I’ve used one at home for a decade, gave another to a friend who was moving from home roasting to open his own coffee shop, I know the machines well and have spare pumps, valves, etc.

So my idea is to refurbish two similar or identical machines and mount them on rolling bases with quick-disconnect plumbing lines and electrical plugs, not hardwired.  The bases would slot into the coffee counter and latch firmly in place.  

If her espresso machine fails, she can unhook and roll it away, roll in and hook up the spare machine, and be back in business in the 15 minutes it takes for the boiler to heat.  Then I can come repair the failed machine after my workday or over the weekend.

Similarly, regular maintenance could be more convenient.  

On the downside, the counter and plumbing will be more complicated and the spare machine needs to be stored somewhere.  Ideally a location with water and power so it can be turned on and “exercised” occasionally.  

Also on the downside, commercial machines don’t really fail often.  I don’t know how often your machines go down.  So maybe this is unneccessary.

Endless resumes, biased interviews, and onboarding nightmares are costing companies billions every year. So why waste time with the drama when you could just… hire AI instead?

🤖 AI doesn’t call in sick.

🤖 Doesn’t take coffee breaks.

🤖 Never complains about workload.

🤖 Works 24/7 crunching data, managing projects, and handling customer support flawlessly.

With AI assistants, chatbots, and automated decision-makers evolving fast, we’re already halfway there — and it’s only accelerating.

Think about it: AI delivers consistent results, unbiased decisions, and scales instantly — unlike humans who need constant training, management, and hefty paychecks.

Yes, humans bring creativity and empathy — but for repetitive, routine, data-heavy tasks? AI kills it, and at a fraction of the cost.

The real question is: Are you ready to rethink your workforce? Are you ready to invest in AI “employees” and leave outdated hiring in the dust?

I’m ready for the backlash — but if you’re NOT considering AI-first hiring strategies in 2025, you’re already falling behind.

So, what do YOU think? Is AI the future of work, or are we sacrificing humanity for convenience? Drop your thoughts — let’s discuss! 👇",1,1748236348.0,u_Time-Ad-4663,0,1.0,False

She left me because I didn’t rinse the mug.

This happened about a year ago, but I still think about it more than I'd like to admit.

It was Tuesday. Ordinary, harmless Tuesday. I got up earlier than usual. I thought I'd surprise her with coffee. Alam ko kasi na may online meeting siya that morning, tapos palaging inaabot ng alanganin sa breakfast.

So I made her coffee. Two sugars, konting gatas, no stirring, because she likes watching the swirl. I placed it beside her laptop, kissed her forehead, and whispered, ""Good luck, love.""

She smiled. That slow, sleepy smile na parang, well, parang mahal pa rin ako. But there was something quieter about it. Like it was showing up out of habit, not feeling.

That night, tahimik siya. Akala ko pagod lang. So I gave her space. Hindi ko siya kinulit. Hindi ko alam na yun na pala yung huling gabi na may kami pa.

The next morning, she said we needed to talk. No warning. No signs. Just that line that splits timelines, before and after.

""I can't do this anymore.""

My world stopped. Of course it did. So I asked why. And she said it. Because I didn't rinse the mug. Akala ko joke. I even laughed. Sabi ko, ""Huh? Yung mug? Yung kape kahapon?"" She said yes. That I always leave things almost done. Laging may kulang. And that she got tired of trying to love someone who only ever meets her halfway.

And just like that, it all unraveled.

Apparently, the mug wasn't just a mug. It was the last drop in a cup I didn’t know I'd been filling with my failures. I didn't rinse the mug. I forgot to send that playlist she asked for. I always left my socks near the laundry basket, not in it. I said ""later"" too many times and ""I'm tired"" too often. I missed the details. The ones that mattered to her.

So yeah. She left me because I didn't rinse the mug. 

And I used to think that was absurd. Petty, even. But now I get it. Because love isn't always loud. Sometimes, it's in the small things. And when you keep neglecting the small things, you make them feel that the little parts of them don't matter either.",423,1748236245.0,OffMyChestPH,69,0.95,False

At first I just used it straight. Ie I just told it to calculate what I ate. Then I set up a new GPT and told it my goals height weight age uploaded screenshots of apple health data. etc.  

Advantages are you can take photos of a plate of food and it will get it about right esp if you put a scale object in photo. 

You can say I'm going to a Mexican restaurant tonight (give name) tell it to check menu and suggest best options. 

Also if you screw up and drink a 6 pack it will advise on how to get back on track

It also can read screenshots of your gym records and tell you how you are progressing better tips to recover etc. 

If you have chat GPT I don't think you need to bother w calorie counting

Just say I drank a coffee, had 2slice white toast whatever. It can even suggest what to eat based of photo of what is in fridge

Things not good about it are:
It makes errors on calorie total sometimes so you need to check it. and for some reason occasionally screws up what day it is.
But overall it's doable more than a calorie logger. Simple nothing to look up. I've been using since Jan.  Slow weightloss. And of course it's always on your side and doesn't beat you up n

One of the most recognized nootropics is caffeine. Commonly consumed through coffee or energy drinks, caffeine acts as a stimulant, increasing alertness and energy. It is particularly popular among students looking for a quick boost during late-night study sessions.

Rhodiola Rosea is another potent herb taken by students for its adaptogenic properties. This natural nootropic is known to reduce fatigue and enhance mental performance under stress, making it an excellent supplement for exam preparation.

Panax Ginseng is often included in nootropic stacks due to its potential to improve cognitive function and memory. Combined with other focus supplements, it can create a synergistic effect, benefiting students in their learning processes.

Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish oil, are essential for brain health. Studies suggest regular intake may support cognitive function, particularly in memory retention and processing speed, making them a great addition to a student’s diet.

Lastly, L-theanine, commonly found in green tea, can promote a calming effect while improving focus. When paired with caffeine, it can help mitigate anxiety, resulting in a balanced state of alertness that many students crave during their studies.

Incorporating these nootropics into a daily routine can support sustained focus and cognitive enhancement, ultimately aiding students in achieving their academic goals. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.

1kvm2at,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1kvm2at/relapsed_after_45_years/,Relapsed after 4.5 years,"I went and stayed at my moms for a weekend who is a smoker. She is my trigger because I’ve had so many bonding moments smoking with her since I was young. I started bumming her cigs with her because one I was in vacation mode and two I missed her and our smoking time together. I went home dedicated to not smoking and to only smoke when I visit her. 5 months later I found myself obsessing over cigarettes. Every show I watched, every post on sm I saw with a cigarette made me want one so badly. I caved this weekend and bought 3 packs of my favorite brand. I don’t drink and I also quit weed not too long ago and I justified cigarettes because I am vice-less. I think the real issue here is that I am lacking connections in my personal life. My mom is my only friend and the only one I talk to. And being alone has made me reminisce on the past when cigarettes were my ritual for not only chilling alone but also by connecting with other smokers at concerts, parties, bars and coffee shops.",8,1748235443.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False
1kvm29j,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kvm29j/the_invisible_backpack_a_story_about_mental/,The Invisible Backpack: A Story About Mental Health and Wellbeing,"No one noticed the invisible backpack Liam carried.

From the outside, he looked like the guy who had it all together. Sharp suit, polished shoes, a quick smile for his coworkers. Every morning, he’d breeze into the office with a cup of coffee in one hand and a confident nod to the receptionist. But what no one could see was the weight he carried.

His invisible backpack was filled with things that had no shape but immense gravity. Sleepless nights, self-doubt, the endless pressure to perform, and that quiet voice whispering *“You’re not enough.”*

It started small. A missed gym session here, an ignored call from a friend there. The backpack got a little heavier each time Liam told himself he didn’t have time to unwind, didn’t need to talk, didn’t want to seem weak. He believed resilience meant silence. That strength meant smiling through storms.

But even the strongest backs can buckle under too much weight.

One evening, as the sun painted the sky with pink and orange hues, Liam sat alone in his apartment, scrolling through photos of happy people he barely knew. A sharp ache settled in his chest. The loneliness was deafening. His phone buzzed — a message from his old friend, Maya: *“Hey, haven’t heard from you in a while. How’s life treating you?”*

For reasons he didn’t understand, Liam replied with a simple, *“Not great.”*

Maya called. And for the first time in months, Liam talked. He spoke about the long hours, the anxiety, the fear of failing, and the weight of expectations. There were pauses, silences where words failed him, but Maya just listened.

The invisible backpack began to lighten.

The next day, Liam booked a session with a therapist. It wasn’t easy. It felt awkward, like speaking a language he hadn’t yet learned. But little by little, he unpacked that backpack. He started walking again in the mornings, cooking meals instead of ordering takeout, and reconnecting with people who made him feel seen.

And what Liam discovered was this: everyone carries an invisible backpack.

Some days it’s light, filled with joys and laughter. Other days it’s heavy, burdened with grief, stress, and old wounds. And the only way to truly lighten it is to acknowledge it — to ask for help, to talk, to rest.

Mental health isn’t about avoiding the storms but learning how to dance in the rain, knowing it’s okay to get drenched, to stumble, and to ask for an umbrella when the downpour feels too much.

Liam’s story isn’t unique. It belongs to the colleague who hides behind humor, the friend who suddenly withdraws, the family member you haven't heard from in a while. And perhaps, it belongs to you.

So check in — with yourself and with others. Speak kindly, listen deeply. The world would be a lighter, kinder place if we all helped carry each other’s invisible backpacks from time to time.

Because mental health matters. And no one should have to carry it alone.",1,1748235439.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

***Quail Creek Reservoir***

***2008***

They left before dawn.

Owen woke him with a gentle shake and a thermos of hot chocolate, steam curling into the predawn air. The truck was already loaded, rods, tackle box, a small cooler packed with sandwiches, and a bag of red licorice he’d picked up the night before.

Dean climbed into the passenger seat, still in his hoodie and pajama bottoms, and they pulled out of the driveway as the world yawned awake.

They didn’t talk much at first. Just the sound of tires on the road and the soft hum of a country station on low volume. Owen sipped his coffee. Dean dozed against the window, the glass fogging under his breath.

They reached Quail Creek just as the horizon lit up, casting orange streaks across the water. Mist rolled off the reservoir in low, lazy sheets. The water looked like it was breathing, like it remembered things people had forgotten.

Owen parked, grabbed the gear, and they made their way down to the shore, boots crunching over sand and broken reeds.

“I like mornings out here,” Owen said, setting up a rod for Dean. “No shop talk. Just fish.”

Dean smirked. “And bad jokes.”

Owen grinned. “That too.”

They cast their lines, sat on overturned buckets, and watched the water.

A memory stirred, this same shoreline a year earlier. Caleb had come that day. He’d dropped his pole into the lake trying to catch a plastic bag he mistook for a fish. Owen had laughed so hard he nearly spilled his hot chocolate.

Now that spot sat empty. Dean didn’t say anything, but he felt it.

“You’ve been quiet lately,” Owen said after a while, reeling in, checking his bait. “Everything okay?”

Dean shrugged. “Yeah. Just been busy.”

“Bishop Hayes keeping you on your toes?”

Dean nodded, then asked, “Do you think I’m a leader?”

Owen didn’t respond right away. He adjusted the reel, then cast again, the line slicing through the morning calm.

Owen finally said. “You’re sharp. People follow you. Just make sure you’re still the one steering.”

Dean looked at his dad. “You don’t trust him?”

Owen didn’t flinch. “I trust you.”

Dean stared at the water. “He says you’ve changed. That you’re not the same man you used to be.”

Owen exhaled slowly through his nose. His shoulders dropped.

“I am different,” he said. “I don’t say yes to everything. I don’t pretend to be someone I’m not just to keep my calling. That scares men like him. But that shouldn’t scare you.” Dean didn’t answer.

“I mean it,” Owen said gently. “You don’t have to be afraid of being like me.”

“I’m not,” Dean said too quickly. Owen raised an eyebrow but didn’t push. Instead, he reached into the tackle box and pulled something small from the bottom, an old silver lure, scratched and a little bent.

“This used to be your grandpa’s,” Owen said, turning it over in his palm. “He gave it to me when I was around your age. Said if I ever lost the trail, I should follow the water.”

Dean took it and ran his thumb over the cool metal. “What does that mean?”

Owen shrugged. “Probably nothing. He wasn’t a poet. But he meant that things get clearer when you sit still long enough.”

Dean pocketed the lure without comment. They fished for another hour. Quiet. Steady.

Dean watched Owen from the corner of his eye, how he moved slowly but deliberately, how he always seemed to know when a line needed checking or when a fish was testing the bait. There was no urgency in him. No need to prove anything.

Bishop Hayes was the opposite. All precision. All fire. He made Dean feel like he was on the edge of something big, something sacred. When he spoke, it felt like he was running toward something. When Owen spoke, it felt like grounding. And somehow, both felt like love.

That’s what made it so hard.

At one point, Owen shifted slightly, his expression thoughtful.

“There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask,” he started, then stopped. He reeled in slowly, line tight, eyes on the horizon. Dean waited, but Owen never finished the thought.

Instead, he changed the subject. “You want to drive on the way back?”

Dean blinked. “Seriously?”

Owen grinned. “You break the truck, you’re buying the parts.”

Dean took the wheel on the dirt road, heart thumping with the thrill of doing something grown-up. The engine rumbled under his hands, and the tires jostled through packed gravel. Owen didn’t hover. Just rested his elbow out the window, one arm catching the wind like he was testing its temperature. They didn’t talk much on the way home, but Dean kept that silver lure in his pocket the whole time.





***Maya***

***Washington***

***2008***

The morning bled itself into being when Maya Bishop woke. The cloud of sleep refused to be cleared cleanly from her mind as she rose and stretched. Sluggishly, she made her way down to her family’s kitchen, her hunger led by a leash.

As she ate, she could feel her awareness reforging its edge, her mind finally warming up to the task of being present for the day.

There used to be more days than not when Penny would be going through this with her, but lately she’d been focused on her calling, helping the bishop. Maya had tried to pry out of her what it was, but all Penny would give away was that he was preparing her to find a husband. Now, Penny couldn’t be bothered for a sugared jump start to her morning, and seemed to skip quite a few meals all too often.

Maya moved back to her room to get dressed for the day, worrying for her sister. Their bond had been adamant for as long as she could remember, and her core shook at the loss rearing its head.

She heard Penny exit her room down the hall and all but rushed out to catch up with her. Maya told her of the creative writing teacher she had that year. Yet another attempt where she was simply trying to get Penny to engage with her like she used to, but to no avail.

Scrutinizing her appearance like she had done so often before, Maya noticed how puffy her eyes were and the scabs on her lower lip. Like she’d been trying to hold back tears and had to bare her teeth for the strength needed to dam them.

“Pen, I was hoping we could ride together. To school?” It came out more pleading than she had intended, almost desperate in the need for her sister to return. Penny looked at her, and through her. A fear that cast the light behind her eyes into a shadow beyond sight.

“I’m sorry Mai, I can’t today.” Her voice came out rough, almost gravely, the damage of someone who had cried out into an emptiness that wouldn’t hear them. “I have to attend a seminary lesson. First period. I won’t even be at the school when you need to be.” Maya’s shoulders slumped, but she nodded the acknowledgment Penny sought in her empty stare. Maya held that gaze, hoping against the logic gnawing at her the answer would change.

The alchemy of the moment never came, and Penny drifted out the door. Her ghost, girl-like frame, entering their old Buick and turning the engine over. Maya would come to hate that car and those moments. The seats that had held her sister when she should have been doing so, and the moments she was powerless in her ability to spot the signs of distress. The signs of a young woman in need. Penny’s face would always haunt those dreams, even in waking.",2,1748235353.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1kvm0tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1kvm0tt/the_open_marriage_trapfaking_love_with_a_secret/,"""The Open Marriage Trap：Faking Love with a Secret CEO Novel""- My husband, Ryan, is standing on the karaoke stage, making a fool of himself.","Chapter 1\~\~Julie\~\~  
  
  
  
My husband, Ryan, is standing on the karaoke stage, making a fool of himself. His shirt is unbuttoned halfway, his tie long abandoned, and his cheeks are flushed from too much whiskey.  
  
“And I………will always love you…..” he sings, closing his eyes.  
  
His voice is terrible.  
  
Standing next to him, practically glued to his side, is his secretary, Emily. Her left arm is around Ryan’s waist, her fingers lightly grazing his back as she sings along. She’s younger than me, at least by half a decade, all wide eyes and perfect curves, dressed in a tight, low-cut dress that makes it impossible to ignore her presence. She leans into Ryan, whispering something in his ear, and he throws his head back, laughing. He looks at her like she’s the funniest person in the world.  
  
I’ve never seen him this happy.  
  
The last time I saw him this happy was on our wedding day, seven years ago. Back then, his eyes sparkled when he looked at me. Now, the light in them has grown dimmer; they’re shining for someone else.  
  
Around me, everyone is laughing. It’s the company’s quarterly review party, and the employees are loose after a few too many drinks, finding Ryan and Emily’s performance hilarious. But I know what they’re really laughing at. They’re laughing at me. The CEO’s wife, sitting here while her husband practically gropes his secretary in front of everyone. The whispers, the side glances, they don’t even try to hide it.  
  
“Do you think they’re going to kiss?” someone whispers behind me.  
  
“Definitely. Bet they’ll be doing more than kissing after this,” someone else replies, and they both chuckle.  
  
I turn around to look at the people talking. Young, drunk, probably high on weed too. They must be interns. Only people with zero knowledge of the company’s hierarchy would make such a statement close to their employer’s wife.  
  
Or maybe they just don’t care.  
  
The girl, with messy blonde hair and red cheeks, locks eyes with me. “Hi!” she says, a little too loud. “Do you work here?”  
  
Do I work here? My eyes narrow. She’s definitely an intern.  
  
She’s pretty, the kind of pretty that comes with youth and arrogance. The boy next to her drapes his arm lazily over her shoulders.  
  
I don’t respond. I just stare at them, cold and unblinking.  
  
Before I can say something that would make them regret their existence, I hear my name called.  
  
“Julie!” the voice says, drawing my attention.  
  
Even before I turn, I know who it is. Samantha, the vice president of marketing. We both work for Paragon Jewels, Ryan’s company, the leading manufacturer of luxury jewelry in North America. Her position is just below mine, so she’s one of the few who calls out my name like we’re friends, even though we’re not.  
  
“Samantha,” I reply, forcing a polite smile.  
  
“I didn’t know you were here, Julie. I was just telling the marketing team we have to get you involved more!”  
  
“Oh?” I say. “Why’s that?”  
  
“Well, you’re the head of marketing, and everyone wants to meet you! You’re so hard to catch these days. And besides, we never get a chance to chat at work,” she says, with an overplayed wink.  
  
Her gaze drifts to the stage where Ryan and Emily are swaying together, sharing the mic, laughing like they’re on some private date instead of a work event.  
  
“So, Mrs. O’Brien,” she says, smirking, “how are you enjoying the show so far?”  
  
She’s mocking me. The fucking bitch.  
  
I force a bright smile. “Oh, it’s… fantastic,” I say, struggling to keep a straight face. “I’m thrilled to see my husband’s hard work is being rewarded with such… dedication from his staff.”  
  
The crowd is clapping now, giving Ryan and his secretary a standing ovation. I guess they’re done with their nonsense.  
  
But then Ryan speaks into the microphone. “Before we get down, we’ve got one more song for you!”  
  
More applause. More laughter. And I just want the ground to open up and swallow me.  
  
Samantha looks at me with pity in her eyes. “Well… umm,” she says. “I’ll catch up with you later.”  
  
She quickly excuses herself.   
  
Behind me, I hear those interns whispering again. “Oh, my God. Did you hear what she said? That’s Mrs. O’Brien.”  
  
I turn to glare at them one last time, and the boy shifts uncomfortably, pulling the girl to her feet. “Let’s go,” he mutters under his breath, and they stumble away, sneaking a look at me before disappearing into the crowd.   
  
Good. Let them run.  
  
I turn back to the stage, my heart pounding in my chest. Ryan is singing “Everything I Do”—if you can call that singing. Emily is now pressed against him, her hand running up his arm in a way that makes my stomach twist. She’s completely shameless, and he’s too drunk to even notice—or worse, he doesn’t care.   
  
I can’t take it anymore.  
  
Without thinking, I push my chair back and stand. My heels click against the floor as I march toward the stage. I can feel the weight of everyone’s eyes on me, the whispers dying down as they realize what’s happening. They’ve been waiting for this—waiting to see if I’ll crack.   
  
But I don’t care. I’m done playing the perfect wife.  
  
I climb the steps to the stage, each footstep feeling heavier than the last. Ryan doesn’t notice me at first, too lost in his drunken performance, but Emily spots me and her smile falters. Good.   
  
“Ryan,” I say. “We’re leaving now.”  
  
Ryan looks at me, surprised. “Why?” he slurs, still holding the microphone. “The party’s just getting started.”   
  
I grit my teeth, my fists clenched. “Let’s go. Now.”  
  
“Julie, come on,” he says, sounding annoyed now, as if I’m the one ruining his night.   
  
I can’t help it. Something inside me snaps.  
  
Without another word, I turn and walk toward the back of the stage. The technical operators sitting in the booth look up as I approach, their faces going pale.   
  
“Who’s in charge here?” I ask.  
  
They all point to a man standing near the soundboard, holding a half-eaten donut. His eyes widen as he sees me.  
  
“Mrs. O’Brien,” he stammers, quickly setting the donut aside. “Is there something—uh—something I can do for you?”  
  
“Shut it down. All of it,” I say. “The party’s over.”  
  
He blinks, not sure if I’m serious, but one look at my face and he scrambles to obey. His hands fly across the controls, and within seconds, the speakers cut out with a harsh screech. The lights dim. The music dies. Silence falls over the room like a heavy curtain, and all that’s left is the sound of my heels as I walk back to center stage.  
  
Ryan is standing there, his microphone useless in his hand.  
  
“Julie, what the hell?” Ryan mutters.  
  
I meet his eyes, feeling the weight of everything I’ve been holding in for too long. “You’ve had your fun,” I say quietly, but with enough steel in my voice that it stops him from saying anything else. “Now it’s over.”  
  
I don’t wait for a reply. I grab his arm and start leading him down the stairs.  
  
Ryan stumbles slightly, caught off guard by my sudden forcefulness. His eyes flick to the crowd, scanning their faces for something, maybe support, validation, but all he finds are wide eyes and muted whispers. Everyone’s too shocked, too entertained by the unfolding drama, to come to his defense.  
  
The whispers start immediately. I hear snatches of conversation as we pass. Let them talk. Let them laugh.  
  
Ryan’s too drunk to fight me, too embarrassed to protest. For once, he’s the one who’s quiet, and I’m the one in control.  
  
Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard/chauffeur, sees us coming and is already moving into action. He steps forward, opening the back door of the car without a word.  
  
Ryan mumbles something under his breath—maybe an apology, maybe an excuse—but I don’t stop. I don’t even look at him. I tighten my grip, forcing him into the backseat with a firm push, and he collapses into the car.  
  
“Take us home,” I say, climbing in behind Ryan. Then I slam the door shut.  
  
Chapter 2It’s true what they say about marriage: one partner is always happier than the other.  
  
  
  
In my case, I’m the unhappy one.  
  
I’m the one who can’t sleep. I’m the one who watches her husband’s sleeping face at night, looking for a sign—anything to prove what I’ve suspected all along, that he’s cheating on me. Just say a word, goddammit, a name, something, dear God. That’s all I want. Say Emily, Ryan. Say Emily.  
  
But Ryan never does. He’s too controlled for that.  
  
I’m the one checking his phone, seeing notifications from the same person, the same tiny image. But I can’t see the name of the sender, can’t recognize the face due to the image size—though it looks like Emily. I can’t even read the messages because Ryan has privatized his pop-up notifications.  
  
I’m in the kitchen right now, already on my fifth cup of coffee. And it’s just 6 AM.  
  
“Morning,” Ryan says, walking in, rubbing his temple. “Feels like someone took a chainsaw to my head. Last night was fun.”  
  
“I’m glad you had fun,” I reply, trying to keep my voice steady, but the bitterness slips through. He notices it, of course. He always does.  
  
“Something wrong?” Ryan asks, eyeing me cautiously.  
  
“Wrong?”  
  
“You seem… I don’t know, off.”  
  
I’m counting down from ten in my head. Calm down, Julie. Calm the hell down. But how can I? Ryan disgraced me last night, and he doesn’t even remember?  
  
“I’m fine,” I say.  
  
Ryan fetches himself a cup of coffee and joins me at the table. He’s watching me with that innocent look of his.  
  
Sometimes I forget how handsome he is. With his lovely, sharp jawline and his bright green eyes. The eyes were the first thing I fell in love with. We were freshmen in college, and Ryan mistook me for some girl he brought to the frat party, a girl he swore was his girlfriend. And well, I played along. I enjoyed playing the part, letting him call me Vivian. And in the morning, when he was sober again and didn’t recognize me, I told him Vivian no longer wanted him and I did.  
  
Funny how things turn out.  
  
“You say you’re fine,” Ryan says, breaking the silence, “but you keep looking at me like you want to murder me.”  
  
I grip the edge of the table, my nails digging into the wood. “You humiliated me last night, Ryan. How is anyone supposed to respect me when my own husband doesn’t?”  
  
“What are you talking about?”  
  
“I’m talking about your stupid karaoke performance yesterday with that bitch, Emily.”  
  
Ryan slaps his forehead dramatically. “Oh, not this again. I’ve told you a hundred times, Julie, there’s nothing to worry about. You always bring her up, like you’re obsessed or something.”  
  
“Obsessed?”  
  
I want to throw my coffee cup at something, and it definitely isn’t the wall.  
  
“You have a life most women would kill for,” he continues. “A great job, a husband who comes home every night. Do you know how many women throw themselves at me? And yet, I come home to you. I pay your family’s bills. I’ve set up trust funds for your nieces and nephews. But it’s never enough, is it? You’re always whining about the same thing—Emily this, Emily that. It’s exhausting.”  
  
I’m shaking now, my heart pounding so hard I can barely breathe. But if I say anything more, he’ll call my mother again, and she’ll tell me I’m being ungrateful. “Stop trying to push Ryan into divorcing you, Julie,” she’ll say. “No one wants hand-me-downs. Do you want to be alone forever? Go on your knees and tell Ryan you’re sorry for being a bitch.”  
  
“How would you like me to show my gratitude, my lord?” I say, glaring at Ryan. “Should I commission a carven image of you and worship it?”  
  
“I’m not in the mood for your sarcasm, Julie. My head is already pounding enough.” Then something crosses his eyes, a strange look. “Actually, there’s something I’ve been meaning to discuss with you. I feel like now’s the right time.”  
  
Oh, God. My stomach tightens. He’s going to ask for a divorce. I can feel it. Mom’s going to kill me. She already planned a vacation in Rio in December.  
  
“What is it?” I ask, bracing myself.  
  
“I want an open marriage.”  
  
For a moment, the words don’t register. “What?” I say.  
  
“That’s when a couple decides to give each other room to see other people, and—”   
  
“I know what an open marriage means, Ryan. Jesus Christ. The answer is no.”  
  
He looks at me with disdain. “I wasn’t asking. From now on, we’re in an open marriage. When you see me with someone else, don’t bother asking questions.”   
  
My heart slams in my chest. “It’s only an open marriage if I agree. And I don’t.”  
  
I’m on my feet now, pacing the kitchen, trying to contain the rage and hurt boiling inside me. Seven years of marriage, and I’m already gearing close to a heart attack.   
  
“I want kids, Julie,” Ryan says. “How am I supposed to have any if I don’t date someone else?”  
  
I can’t help it; I begin to cry. “But it’s not my fault.”   
  
“It’s not my fault either. Maybe it’s just us together.”  
  
I can’t believe he said that. We’ve tried for seven years, spent a lot of money. And it’s always the same reply: you’re both healthy. The embryos are just acting weird. Nine IVFs.   
  
I untie my robe and let it fall to the floor, stripping down until I’m standing naked in front of him. Ryan’s eyes widen in surprise.  
  
I move closer and straddle him. I then grab his hand and place it on my chest. “Does this not move you anymore?”   
  
“Julie—”  
  
“Am I ugly to you now?” I reach into his pants, but he quickly stands, pushing me away.   
  
“Stop it,” he says firmly, putting space between us. “Put your clothes back on.”  
  
Trembling, I watch as he walks away, heading for the stairs.   
  
“Wait,” I call out, my voice shaky.  
  
Ryan turns, impatient. “What?”  
  
“It’s cool,” I say, my voice hollow. “Let’s have an open marriage.”  
  
Ryan nods. “Good.”  
  
And just like that, he walks away, leaving me in a million pieces.  
  
\~\~\~  
  
I like to say I’m a calm person. Sometimes I swear I’m the most level-headed person I know. All my family are maniacs. My sisters, my brothers. My parents. I’ve always been the one bailing people out of prison. I’ve been the designated driver during college wild night parties. I’ve been the cover-up story for my friends in high school. Yeah, everyone claimed they were spending the night at Julie’s house. Because their parents knew I’m a decent person.  
  
But for the first time in my life, I think I want to kill someone.  
  
I’m watching our driveway from the window, and Ryan is stepping out of his car with none other than Emily. Fucking Emily. And she’s carrying suitcases.  
  
“What’s going on?” I ask as soon as Ryan and Emily step into the house.  
  
Ryan smiles. “Julie, meet Emily.”  
  
“I know who she is, Ryan.”  
  
“Good. Then I won’t need to explain. Emily’s moving in.”  
  
I’m honestly too stunned to speak. What does he mean by that? After what feels like ages, I ask, “Is she homeless?”  
  
“No,” Ryan says. “She’s my girlfriend now.”  
  
Chapter 3I look at Ryan, then Emily. “I don’t understand.”  
  
  
  
Ryan doesn’t even look at me, just grabs Emily’s hand and starts leading her away. “Stop being such a bad host, Julie. We’ve had a long day.”  
  
“No way, Ryan. She’s not staying in this house,” I say, my voice shaking with disbelief.  
  
He doesn’t respond. They’re already halfway up the stairs.  
  
“Do you hear me? She’s not staying here! Take her back to wherever you picked her up. I don’t want her in my house.”  
  
Ryan stops, turning just enough to glare at me. “Your house? I put a roof over your head. If I say she’s staying, she’s staying. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. I don’t have the energy for your nonsense, Julie.”  
  
Oh, my god. My chest tightens. “How could you do this?” I say. “Don’t walk away from me, Ryan. Stand here and answer me.”  
  
Emily turns to look at me, smirking. “By the way, you’ll need to move your things into the guest room. I’m not sharing a bed with you and Ryan. It’s bad enough sharing him with you.”  
  
All the energy in me evaporates. I just stand there, speechless. I can’t move. I can’t breathe. I hear them whispering and giggling as they head into our bedroom. My room. They’re kicking me out of my own room.  
  
The living room suddenly feels too small.  
  
I stumble to the front door, fling it open, and run outside, needing to escape. I don’t know where I’m going, but I can’t be here.  
  
“Ma’am, are you alright?” Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard, asks as I approach, breathless. He’s wiping down Ryan’s Rolls-Royce, eyeing me with concern.  
  
I hold out my hand. “The keys.”  
  
“Ma’am?”  
  
“The damn keys, Justin.”  
  
He hesitates for a second, but hands them over. I know he’s wondering why I need Ryan’s car when I have my own. Honestly, I don’t know either. But if I stay here for one more second, I might lose it completely.  
  
“Mrs. O’Brien, let me drive you—”  
  
“No, Justin. I’ll drive myself.”  
  
I pull out of the driveway and speed off into the night.  
  
\~\~\~  
  
It’s been over an hour, and I’m still driving aimlessly. My mind is a blur of everything—Ryan, Emily, their smug faces. Initially, I’d planned a Saturday evening manicure and pedicure, just to get my mind off things. Things that involve Ryan. But I’m no longer in the mood to get my feet and hands pampered. It’s not even been two days since he dropped that bombshell about an open marriage, almost giving me a heart attack, and now he’s bringing his mistress over? Emily? The same Emily?  
  
The craziest thing is I can’t cry. I feel nothing. No tears, no anger—just this hollow emptiness. The last therapist I spoke with said it’s a defense mechanism. That I’m in denial of my actual emotions. Cry it out, Julie, she used to say. Let yourself be free of the burden.  
  
Well, they can all go to hell. Ryan. Emily. The therapist. My entire family.  
  
I know what I need. A drink.  
  
I pull into the nearest bar and head inside.  
  
“A shot of whiskey,” I tell the bartender. “Neat. And keep them coming.”   
  
“Long night?”  
  
“I don’t want to talk about it,” I say.   
  
He pours the first shot, and I throw it back, welcoming the burn in my throat. It’s harsh, but it’s better than the alternative—thinking about what’s happening back home.  
  
As I down my second shot, I hear someone call out, “Maggie! Maggie!”   
  
I turn, confused, and see a tall, handsome man approaching me, his eyes locked on mine. Before I can react, he’s wrapping his arms around me. “Thank God I found you,” he says, pulling me into a tight hug.  
  
I stiffen. “Who the hell are you?”   
  
“Please, just go along with it,” he whispers in my ear. “I’ll explain later. I promise.”  
  
Before I can push him away, a furious-looking woman storms over.   
  
“Luke! I knew it. You can’t hide from me.”  
  
The stranger—Luke, apparently—turns to face her, still keeping his arm around me. “Veronica, what a surprise,” he says, feigning nonchalance.   
  
“My name isn’t Veronica, it’s Evelyn.”  
  
Luke flashes her a sheepish smile. “Right, sorry. I get those mixed up sometimes. Anyway, this is Maggie—my wife.”  
  
He lifts my hand, showing off my wedding ring, and I nearly choke. What is happening?  
  
Evelyn glares at me. “You married this scumbag?”  
  
I don’t know what to say, so I just nod.  
  
“You should divorce him,” she snaps. “He spends one night with you and disappears the next. Who does that?”  
  
“But that’s what we agreed on. A one-night st—” Luke begins, but Evelyn cuts him off.  
  
“Fuck you, Luke.”  
  
And with that, she storms off, leaving the two of us standing there, stunned.  
  
Luke breathes a sigh of relief. “Well, that one was a stalker. At least she’s off my back now.” He turns to me, smiling. “Can I buy you a drink? You’ve definitely earned it.”  
  
I stare at him and then stare at the spot where the angry lady once stood. It all happened so fast. I can’t even process it. I think I need that drink.  
  
“Make it two,” I say.  
  
And Luke smiles.  
  
Chapter 4\~\~Luke\~\~  
  
  
  
Lord knows I’ve seen my fair share of beauties.  
  
But the lady beside me is something else. Not only is she the prettiest thing I’ve seen, but she’s married. Some men are just lucky.  
  
“So, I’m guessing your name isn’t Maggie?” I ask, trying to ease the tension.  
  
“No,” she replies flatly.  
  
I nod, waiting for her to give me something more. “So, what is it?”  
  
She gives me a slow, deliberate look. I can’t lie, wherever her eyes touch immediately burns.  
  
“Look,” I say, raising my hands in mock surrender. “I’m not hitting on you. Honestly, I’m taking a break from women. They’re problematic.”  
  
She lets out a laugh, a bitter one. “You’re the one who just hugged a stranger to dodge another woman you’ve clearly wronged, and you’re saying we’re the problematic ones? You men are all the same.”  
  
She downs her drink like it’s water and winces at the burn. That’s her second shot in less than five minutes. I’ve got to say, I’m impressed.  
  
“Let’s start over,” I suggest, offering her a fresh start. “I’m Luke.”  
  
She rolls her eyes. “Yeah, I caught that. Your ‘problematic’ ex wouldn’t shut up about it.”  
  
“She’s not my ex,” I say.  
  
“Whatever.”  
  
Great, another woman convinced I’m the villain. Not even five minutes in and she’s already pegged me as the problem. I guess I deserve that one.  
  
“So, are you going to tell me your name?” I ask, trying again.  
  
I can tell she’s got money just by looking at her. She’s probably an heiress or the wife of some big-shot businessman. Those Louboutins, the Rolls-Royce keys sitting on the bar, and that dress—all of it screams wealth. Maybe that’s why she’s not keen on giving me her real name.  
  
“You don’t have to tell me your last name,” I say with a grin. “But you look like you could use someone to talk to. Since you just saved my ass back there, I figure it’s the least I can do.”  
  
She watches me for a moment, her expression unreadable, before finally relenting. “Julie. My name’s Julie.”  
  
“Nice to meet you, Julie,” I say, extending my hand.  
  
She takes it.  
  
\~\~\~  
  
Julie’s on her fifth glass of whiskey, and at this point, she’s unstoppable, pouring out her life story like we’ve known each other for years. I’ve already told the bartender to cut her off, but she hasn’t noticed yet.  
  
“…So, I’m standing there, and they’re both going upstairs. To my room. And do you know what the bitch says?” Julie doesn’t wait for me to reply. “She says I need to move out of my room. My room.” She laughs so hard that she starts coughing. And then, just as suddenly, she’s sobbing.  
  
I don’t know what to do. How do you comfort someone else’s wife without crossing a line?  
  
“Julie,” I say. “Are you okay?”  
  
She shakes her head. “I need another drink.”  
  
“No, you don’t.”  
  
She frowns at me. “What? You think I need one more person telling me how to live my life? You can all go to hell. I said I need a drink.” She taps her empty glass against the bar, but the bartender, Mart, knows better than to disobey me.  
  
“Sorry, I own the bar, and I can’t let you drink anymore,” I say.  
  
Her eyes narrow. “Oh, you own the bar? Good for you. I’ll find another one.”  
  
She tries to stand, but I step in her path.  
  
“Listen, Julie, I know you’re hurting, but this isn’t the way to go about it. Have you thought about divorce?”  
  
For the first time, her eyes soften, and she slumps back onto the barstool. “I can’t. I don’t want to be a disappointment to my family. They depend on Ryan’s money.”   
  
I let out a snort. “Screw them. It’s your life. No one should make you feel like this.”  
  
She gives a sarcastic smile. “Easy for you to say, Mr. I-own-the-bar.”   
  
I’ve seen people like Julie before, people who won’t leave a toxic relationship because, deep down, they still love the person. She’s saying it’s because of her family, but I can tell it’s more than that. She’s not ready to let go of him. Love does that to you—it makes you hold on even when you shouldn’t. I know that feeling all too well.  
  
What kind of solution could I possibly suggest that wouldn’t involve me physically dragging her out of the marriage?   
  
Suddenly, an idea hits me. “You know what?” I say. “You need to get yourself a boyfriend. Someone to introduce to Ryan.”  
  
“A boyfriend?” She looks at me like I’ve lost my mind.   
  
It sounds like a stupid plan, but one thing I know about guys who cheat is that they can’t stand being cheated on. It’ll drive him crazy. I’m hoping it leads to Ryan divorcing her, since she’s too chicken to do it herself.  
  
“It doesn’t have to be a real relationship,” I add. “Just hire someone to play that role until Ryan comes back to his senses.”   
  
Julie’s quiet for a moment, turning the idea over in her head. “That’s actually not bad,” she says, surprising me. “Are all bar owners this good at giving advice?”  
  
I laugh. “We try.”   
  
“Okay, but where am I supposed to find this ‘boyfriend’?”  
  
Without thinking, I blurt out, “I could do it.”   
  
Her eyes flicker over me again, slower this time. “You?”  
  
“It’s easier than hiring someone. No need to go through the hassle of finding the right guy, making sure he knows what he’s doing. I’m single, not looking for a relationship, and I like a little adventure. I’d be perfect for the job.”   
  
She studies me, weighing her options. After a moment, she says, “You are good-looking too.”  
  
I raise an eyebrow, but she cuts me off.   
  
“Don’t ask.” She pulls out her phone. “So, how much is this going to cost me?”  
  
I hadn’t thought about money. I don’t need it, but if I offer to do it for free, it might seem weird.  
  
“How much are you willing to pay?” I ask, playing along.  
  
She glances around the bar, one arm raised as if to appraise the place. Her diamond ring catches the light, sparkling like it’s worth a fortune.  
  
“Your bar’s decent,” she says. “What does it make? Two hundred thousand a year? Maybe five?”  
  
I stay silent.  
  
“I’ll double that,” she says.  
  
I raise an eyebrow. “The two hundred?”  
  
“The five hundred.”  
  
Wow. She’s serious. “Deal. But I’ll only take the money after we pull it off.”  
  
She extends her hand. “Deal.”  
  
I shake her hand, her skin soft against mine. I then pull out a pen and scribble my number on a napkin. “Call me when you’re ready.”  
  
She tucks the napkin into her purse and gives me one last look before heading out of the bar. I’m right behind her, escorting her toward a sleek Rolls-Royce.  
  
“You sure you can drive?” I ask.  
  
“I’m not that high, Luke.”  
  
“Alright,” I say. “Give me a call.”  
  
She drives off into the night.  
  
I feel so guilty for letting her leave in that state. But what else could I do? I head back into the bar, already wondering what I’ve gotten myself into.  
  
Chapter 5\~\~Julie\~\~  
  
  
  
Ugh, my head feels like it weighs a thousand pounds.  
  
I crack my eyes open and glance around. I’m in my living room, but I can’t for the life of me remember how I got home last night.  
  
Shit, Ryan’s car.  
  
I scramble to the window, heart racing, and peek outside. There it is, still parked in the driveway. Thank God. Ryan would have been so pissed if I’d wrecked it.  
  
I need a shower. And definitely a toothbrush. My mouth tastes like something died in it.  
  
I drag myself upstairs, but as soon as I push open the master bedroom door, I freeze. Emily is on top of Ryan, both of them completely naked, moving in sync. Their panting fills the room.  
  
I scream.  
  
Emily yelps and tumbles off him, scrambling to cover herself.  
  
“Jesus Christ, Julie,” Ryan mutters, sitting up and glaring at me. “Ever heard of knocking?”  
  
I want to tell him I’ve never had to knock in my own house, let alone my own bedroom, but what’s the point? “I just came to grab my things.”  
  
“It’s already done,” Emily snaps. “Everything you own is in the guest room.”  
  
I nod stiffly and close the door. If I stay in this hallway a second longer, I might decide to walk back in there with a knife. So I climb down the stairs slowly, counting down from ten. You’ve got this, Julie. You’re doing great.  
  
When I get to the guest room, I see Emily’s handiwork. My things are scattered everywhere—on the floor, on the bed, like some chaotic display of disrespect. I’m too tired and hungry to deal with it now.  
  
In the shower, I let the hot water wash over me, willing it to cleanse the pain of yesterday, today, and whatever fresh hell tomorrow brings. The sound of the water is like white noise, drowning out the sobs I refuse to let out. I won’t cry for Ryan. I won’t cry for Emily.  
  
“Martha?” I call, heading into the kitchen where our cook is busy with breakfast.  
  
“Good morning, ma’am,” Martha says, glancing over. “Hope you slept well?”  
  
“Like a baby,” I lie. “I’m starving, though.”  
  
“I’ll bring your food in a moment. Please, take a seat.”  
  
A few minutes later, she sets a plate in front of me, and I blink, surprised. Just a few pieces of lettuce and some sad-looking greens.  
  
“Where’s the rest of it?” I ask, lifting an eyebrow.  
  
“The new missus says we’re no longer allowed to cook high-calorie meals,” Martha explains, looking nervous. “I told her you had a meal plan, but Mr. O’Brien said I’d lose my job if I didn’t follow Ms. Emily’s orders.”  
  
Of course. The little snake is starting a war. First, she takes my husband. Now, she’s messing with my kitchen. Game on.  
  
“That’s fine, Martha. You’re just doing your job.”  
  
I stare at the plate of greens, my stomach growling. I force a bite down, trying not to gag. It’s no wonder Emily’s so tiny—she eats like a rabbit. I try to finish it out of respect for Martha, but every bite feels like torture.  
  
My mind drifts back to last night. Should I call Luke? How are we even supposed to pull off this fake boyfriend plan?   
  
I grab my phone and shoot him a quick text, saving his number under Luke Escort. “Hi, it’s the drunk rich lady from last night. Just letting you know I got home safely, and no scratches on the car. I’ll be in touch about our plan. Cheers.”  
  
I hit send.   
  
Within seconds, his reply comes in. “Who?”  
  
Oh, my god. He doesn’t remember me. Now that’s awkward.   
  
But then he sends, “Kidding. I’ll keep my fingers crossed, Julie.”  
  
Ugh. He’s insufferable.   
  
Just then, I hear footsteps on the stairs. Ryan and Emily appear, hand in hand, looking smug.  
  
“Good morning, Julie!” Emily chirps, smiling too brightly. Her teeth look expensive. “How was breakfast?”   
  
I return her smile. “Delicious. Exactly what I needed. You’re right, we should all be eating like New Yorkers—everyone’s so tiny these days, they might start building smaller doors.”  
  
Emily giggles, clearly missing my sarcasm. “That’s so true, Julie! Martha, we’re ready for our breakfast too.”   
  
Martha brings them the same sad plate of greens she gave me. I smirk as Ryan takes a bite and immediately struggles not to spit it out.  
  
“You like it, babe?” Emily asks.   
  
Ryan nods, chewing reluctantly. “Yeah, it’s… nice.”  
  
Perfect. Now, time to give him something else to choke on.  
  
“You know,” I say, leaning back in my chair, “I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. I realize I gave you a hard time, Ryan. You didn’t deserve that.”  
  
He glances at me warily, sensing something’s off.  
  
“You’re my husband,” I continue, keeping my tone sweet. “And everyone’s entitled to their desires, even if they don’t make sense. So, I’ve decided I’m fully on board with this arrangement.”  
  
Ryan doesn’t look comfortable. After all these years, he knows when I’m bullshitting.  
  
But Emily does not. She seems genuinely relieved. “That’s great to hear, Julie! I mean, humans were never meant to be monogamous.”  
  
“Is that so?” I say, raising an eyebrow.  
  
“Definitely. From the beginning of time, our ancestors were explorers.”  
  
Right. Biology lessons from the woman sleeping with my husband. Fascinating.  
  
“Exactly why I’ve decided to do some exploring myself,” I say, watching their faces closely. “I’ve found myself a boyfriend.”  
  
Ryan freezes, fork halfway to his mouth. Emily’s smile falters.  
  
“Boyfriend?” Ryan asks, his voice tight.  
  
I grin, enjoying the moment. “That’s right, honey. I figure it’s only fair. If you’re going to explore, so am I.”  
  
Chapter 6Ryan has been quiet since I dropped the news.  
  
“Say something,” I say, my voice breaking slightly. But Ryan just stares at me, his jaw clenched, his face rigid. I know that look too well. It’s hino more",1,1748235295.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

**AITAH for hiding that I'm homeless from my girlfriend?**



I'm 18M and I'm dating my girlfriend who just turned 20.

I've been in foster care since I was 13. I lucked out when I was younger, I had some good homes but the most recent one I had was really bad.

I've been homeless for 1 month now. It's been exhausting hiding it from my girlfriend.

One of the jobs I work is at a local martial arts gym in my city which I sneak back into at night because I have keys for lock up. I am pretty sure the owner knows I'm sleeping here because there are cameras. He hasn't said anything. Sometimes he leaves me food. So I'm doing okay for being homeless.

I'm saving up and I'm trying to find another job so I can make money faster and find a place to live. I'm staying out of trouble. I don't drink alcohol and I don't do drugs.

My girlfriend lives in a university dorm with a roommate. She goes to a prestigious school that she worked really hard to get into.

Tonight, she said I have 'sad eyes' and she asked me if something was wrong.

I wanted to break down and tell her everything. Instead, I said I was sleepy and hugged her then made a joke which distracted her and changed the topic.

I know in a relationship, you're supposed to be honest. But I guess I have pride or something. All these years growing up, there were so many times I felt like I had no dignity, so it's really hard for me to let go of this 'pride' or whatever you want to call it. It's hard to explain.

Besides, she can't really help me. It would just be adding to her stress.

AITAH for thinking I can find a place, get settled in, basically fix this problem and then tell her?

I see these on TikTok all the time and I know what I'm asking is not the same as wedding drama or marriage drama but I thought I would give it a shot with this being anonymous and all.

*NTA. But it sounds like you're talking yourself out of opening up to her about this. She might not be able to fix everything, but she can offer support. It sounds like you could really use that right now.*

**AngryDresser**

*Agreed. Also OP, I’m sorry. I’ve been homeless, myself, but this.. you don’t deserve to be 18 dealing with all this. No one does, but you are just in a position I know many go through but I wish no one experienced.*

>OOP: I'm sorry you had to deal with homelessness too. Deep down, I know I am lucky for the circumstances I do have, like the ability to crash at my boss's gym. It's a lot better than a shelter... those honestly scare me.

*My now husband was living between friends houses and a direct provision centre when we met. He is a very proud man and was vague or wouldn't discuss where he lived or allow me to drop him anywhere and said things like he was going to visit friends at night. He was always so upbeat and caring towards me that it seemed like a small thing so i didnt push it. He is also a really hard worker and works day and night. I initially worried he didn't trust me to see his house in case I turned stalker or something 🤣.*

\*I thought with all the working hours maybe he already had a family or something like that except he added me on his social media and openly walked around town with me so that didn't make sense. I totally didn't realise the things he must have been going through till way later till we had our own place and I accidentally saw an old document he had with the DP address as his address and it all made sense also how he is always helping people he meets who have a had time. Ringing friends and getting them a couch to sleep on etc. \*

*At the time he helped me with any problems i was having but is very religious and used to tell me that he shared his problems with God and me being in my little happy self and spending time with him was enough for me to do to help him back. From the woman's perspective I respect him so much. He didn't lie to me but he kind of made it clear what he did and didn't want to talk about and I respected and accepted that. I have a good job and my own money but he always liked to pay for things like if we got coffee etc. Things were probably very hard for him but I'm glad I didn't push it and force him to be vulnerable with me about his fears and circumstances because I know him and that would have damaged his pride in himself. Sorry for the long rambling reply I suppose what I'm saying is once u don't make her question how u feel about her it's ok to struggle and be a man and keep your pride in her eyes.*

>OOP:

>This was really inspiring, i'm really glad you shared this with me. I actually read it over two times because it made me feel less bad about myself.

>I want to be that kind of man one day, like your husband.

>I try to show up for my girlfriend and the few people in my life.. not as a burden, but someone they can rely on. Normally i'm really good at presenting myself a certain way no matter what's happening to me. I will go as far as to hide injuries and I think I have a really high pain tolerance now. I'm always smiling and I like to focus on other people, not myself. But lately I'm working a lot more and even though I have a place to sleep every night, there's this stress that never leaves.. so I guess i'm not as convincing as I usually am because I'm too tired. Like.. Idk what i'm saying right now, what was the point I was trying to make? I need to sleep lol. But you said ""He didn't lie to me but he kind of made it clear what he did and didn't want to talk about and I respected and accepted that""

>Maybe I could try approaching it somehow like that.



**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***



**Update - 14 days later**



Howdy. I just wanted to come back and share that I ended up confiding in my girlfriend about my homelessness. She was devastated for me but ultimately I'm really glad I pushed myself to tell her the truth. It was really eating at me and it was a huge relief in itself to no longer be carrying that around on top of everything else. We're still together (also a huge relief). My girlfriend is keeping my homelessness a secret. One thing I haven't shared with her (or anyone really outside of you guys) is that I continue to struggle with feelings of shame and inadequacy about this situation, but I know those are more my internal dialogue and not necessarily how others perceive me given that they don't really know. I'm trying really hard to keep my head up and maintain my self-worth and convince myself that I'm not trash.

I also ended up telling the owner of the gym I've been crashing at what I've been doing. As I suspected, he knew about it but doesn't want to acknowledge it for insurance purposes so essentially 'this conversation didn't happen'. He said I can keep doing it given that I find housing ASAP. I have to move onto a new place to sleep if I'm still homeless in a few weeks.

I've got 2 places pending that I know are strongly considering me. I'd happily take either one. Affordable housing here is really difficult to come by and very competitive. There's a lot of interest per listing. I started expanding my search area and this helped, although my commute is going to be rough.

Thanks again to everyone who commented on my other post.

*You have people in your life that care about you, keep you head up, you will get through this!*

**CherrySnugglez**

*Absolutely. The support OP’s gotten proves they’re not alone in this, even if it feels like it sometimes. Owning the truth like that takes serious strength, and it’s clear they’ve got people who truly care. One step at a time, they’ve got this.*

**punsnroses420**

*Honestly man, I’m so sorry to hear you’re going through this and I’m sending you an air hug. Sometimes just being able to confide in people about the awful things that happen to us can be such a source of relief and just help with relieving the intense pressure and stress if nothing else, and even if the problems aren’t fixed.*

*Being open about your situation is tough, but for whatever it’s worth I’m honestly proud of you for being brave enough to do it. Being 18 in the world is already hard enough - having to face it out of an unpleasant foster situation and with the stack you’ve been given isn’t fair or right, but I can tell from what you’ve written that you’ve been fighting to get to where you need to go. You’ll get there. You deserve to be happy and have a place to call yours, you deserve to feel safe and get away from the stress you’ve been under.*

>OOP: Thank you so much man, from the bottom of my heart. I’m really glad I posted here. I know we’re all strangers but it’s been so impactful for me to read comments. Thank you for taking time to do that.

>It’s hard to explain but I needed the boost yall gave me. It rewired how I view myself (for the better).

Only wrote the prologue and first chapter here it is:

# Prologue

“The man is watching you!” Nana cried. Amelia sighed, her eyes focused on Nana's frantic grey eyes, which moved rapidly around the bedroom. Where it once was a beautiful pink now seemed hollow and empty, the color faded. Amelia moved her hand on her grandmother's shaking knee, the color splotchy and wrinkled with age.

“Nana there's no man here.” Her words were no use to her grandmother, her eyes were focused on something only she could see. Amelia knew that there was no use even looking where she saw this “man”, she had long since realized that no one stood there.

 When Amelia was a child she remembered trying to search for this “man” or this “monster”  thinking it was a game. It took many talks from her parents, Joslin and Liam to realize that her grandma was schizophrenic. Amelia remembered when she was about seven years old she was making bracelets with Nana when she gasped and screamed “He’s not real, don't trust him!” Amelia told her she didn't like the game, though she started to cry it meant nothing to Nana. She never truly trusted Nana after that.

Amelia thought that she would one day improve and be able to play with her like Grams used to too. It took a long time but she did this more often, she realized that she would not get better but only worsen. Her words became less coherent as she screamed that one day we would understand. But Amelia knew she would never understand what she was screaming about. Though she was scared one day that she would, that the genes would activate in her. Everyone would look at her like she was crazy, she didn't want to be crazy. She hated the test she had to get, when they asked her stupid questions, like “does anything seem strange to you, Amelia?” or “do things appear different from the way they usually do?”

“Nana, did you take your pills?” Though she knew she didn't, Nana often thought that pills were a lure to poison her into giving into the man. Someone visited her daily to make sure she took them, whether it was her, her parents, her brother, Lucas, her uncle and aunt, Danny and Violet, or her cousin, Benji.

 Some days when she had to wake up before the sun and drive the two hours to Nana’s house she wished that they could put her in a facility, but her dad and Aunt Violet had agreed that she should be put in there since it was Grandpa William’s last wish before he passed. It sometimes seemed like so much work for a woman who was so old, Amelia drove those two hours every Tuesday, because she thought she was still her sweet Nana. Nana’s utterances interrupted her thoughts.

“He’ll come for you! I won't let him though!” She pointed a shaky finger at the mirror, her nails were chipped. *I wish she didn't have to experience this, sometimes I just don't know what to do to help you, Nana.*

“I’ll get them for you, Nana, and some water.” Amelia stood up the old bed creaking as her weight lifted off the bed. “Lay down and think of when you and William met.” Amelia left quietly trying not to spook Nana as she left the room. 

As she walked through the pale white hall she saw the picture when Nana was her age, only twenty two. She was kissing Grandpa on the cheek in the park, and Grandpa had a great big smile on his face. Even on Nana’s terribly bad days Grandpa always seemed to be able to cheer her up with a joke or memory. On Nana’s good days she sometimes told of the time they went to the aquarium and water splashed all over them when they went to the whale show. Or the time when Uncle Danny was a kid and he thought it was a good idea to eat an entire ice cream cake and he was sick for three days. Amelia chuckled. Nana daily had her good days now, she was often yelling at the empty space. Remembering that Nana was waiting in her room she quickly hurried down the stairs.

As she reached the bathroom she saw the soft colors, the pearl white calming her. She looked in the mirror, her black shirt had some lint on it, she rubbed it off. The lines on her pale face shows her tiredness. She rubbed her eyes. *I just wanna take a nap.* Amelia sighed and reached up and grabbed the blue bottle. She first checked off  “Tuesday Morning”, on the chart by the medicine cabinet. Amelia took the small pill out of the bottle and put it back in the cabinet. 

She walked to the kitchen passing the blue-gray walls. The kitchen was painted a tan color and a painting of three doves hung next to the window. The window was round, revealing a few bushes. Amelia watched a squirrel run by. Amelia turned to the shelfs they were Imprinted with leaves, she opened the cabinet and carefully grabbed the yellow-green water bottle from the shelf, as she hummed the song she and Nana used to sing; Girls Just Wanna Have Fun. She grabbed the water container from the fridge first watering the plant. The design on the plant was quite nice, it was covered in blue swirls like the ocean’s waves. Amelia loved going to the ocean with Benji, they used to go every Sunday, but since she started her new job they’ve had less time to do so. *I’ll reach out to him today, I miss going. It was so fun.* Then Amelia poured some of the water in the yellow bottle, a bit more than needed to give to take her pills so she could have water for the rest of the day.

Suddenly there was a loud thud from upstairs. Amelia froze, “Nana?” No response. She whipped around her reddish brown curls bouncing on her shoulders. “NANA!?” She knew something was wrong, she would have said something. She ran, knocking down the water pitcher, the water splashed as it hit the ground, forming a puddle. Amelia’s feet stomped as she ran up the stairs. The brown carpet flattened as she ran through the hallway, her heart pounded in her chest. Amelia pushed the door open, Nana was sprawled on the ground, her gray hair going in all directions. 

“My Amelia! He has my arm!” She looked at her left arm. *Fuck, she's having a heart attack! Shit!*

“Nana, you're ok, it’s going to be ok.” She wasn't sure if she was trying to convince herself or Nana Amelia grabbed her hand, squeezing it tight. “It’s going to be ok, it’s going to be ok.” Amelia pulled her phone from her pocket, looking at the lockscreen of her best friend Millie and Audrey and her boyfriend, Charley kissing her. She quickly went to emergency contacts and dialed 911.

“911, what's your emergency?” the operator said. Amelia spoke quietly into the phone. 

“Please help, I think my Nana just had a heart attack.”

# Chapter 1

It had been two months since Nana died. In the first month she woke up early every Tuesday, then her heart fell when she remembered that she was gone. Though she knew she shouldn't, she blamed herself, *if only I was faster downstairs.* But her parents said, 

“She was old, we all knew she was dying.” She tightly pursed her lips together. Amelia felt like it was her fault, like could have done something. Amelia remembered the way Nana looked on the ground, so helpless and scared, not like an ill old woman.  When the doctors got there they tried to resuscitate her. But it was too late. She was already gone.

Amelia walked deeper into the cemetery, the bright sun contrasted with her somber mood. Her shoes crunched on the dry leaves with each step. *It hasn't rained in a while.* Then Amelia saw the headstone; “*Here Lies Abigail Horsin, 1923 - 2014 – Beloved Mother and Friend*” The flowers were fresh. A soft pink bouquet of lilies and roses lay next to the headstone. Carefully Amelia crouched down, and pulled a lightly colored shell. She ran her finger over the ridges slowly, taking a deep breath of the morning air. Amelia’s  eyes filled with tears at the sight of the small shell.

Amelia remembered when she and Nana were playing in the ocean, she was about eight. Amelia thought of the fear when suddenly something touched her leg. She screamed, her voice piercing the calm of the waves. Amelia remembered screaming “It’s a shark! A shark is biting my leg!” Nana looked down, the water barely up to her knees and screamed. 

“I'll get it, no one touches my baby!” She reached her hand into the murky blue water, searching for the culprit that had ferociously attacked me. Nana, her face serious, pulled out the smallest shell. They burst out laughing. Amelia had always kept that shell, now she was giving back to Nana. Amelia had told the same story at her funeral, and she chuckled; the first laugh since she died. *I miss you so much… I wish I could say goodbye.* She felt tears rolling down her cheek, wetting her face but a slight sting pierced her eyes. *Or have spent more time with you. I feel like I wasted it doing stupid things, I’m sorry.* 

“I miss you Nana, you always stopped the days from blurring together.” She gave the shell a kiss and placed it on the dirt. “Here Nana, take this, I love you.” *I shouldn't cry, I'm not a child anymore.* 

Amelia stood there for just over thirty minutes, not wanting to leave Nana alone. She spent a few more seconds just staring at the grave, the stone already starting to wear from the rain. Before Amelia left she gave the shell a last kiss and whispered “I love you.” 

After walking for a minute Amelia pulled v                        v out her phone, wanting to distract herself. She saw her lockscreen of her posing at the top of a hike. Next to her, stood her besties, Millie and Audrey, Audrey’s boyfriend; Jake, stood on the end. Their arms around each other's shoulders and all of them had these dorky smiles on her face, showing all her teeth. She had met the girls at college, they had been paired together freshman year and had been friends ever since.

 She had met Millie first. Millie had dark almond skin and dark freckles and wavy-straight brown hair that went just above her shoulders, but Audrey and Amelia were always trying to convince her to let her natural hair grow out. Millie was very talkative, always ready to cheer someone up. Though she often forgot to cheer  herself up though she still always sported a shining smile.

 Audrey had joined their room later but quickly joined their friend group. Though at first she was laid back, avoiding talking and mumbling answers. Soon though Audrey came out of her shell, and was one of the kindest people Amelia knew. She always perfected her appearance, she had long blond hair, ivory skin and blue-grey eyes. She met boyfriend Jake as early sophomores, and talked about him often. Millie and Amelia questioned him, making sure he was perfect for her. Amelia was surprised they didn't scare Jake away with their interrogation and Jake and Audrey were still dating, their relationship strong.

 Next to her, Charley was kissing her on her cheek. *He has been so supportive through this.* While serving coffee, at the coffee shop where she worked, (Thunder Cafe) she met Charlie, shw him in the far both and he took her breath away. Charlie had brown hair, shining dark green eyes and beige skin. Amelia loved his smile and he liked her laugh, or so he says. They chatted together, about the most obscure things. They liked talking but not wanting to ruin what they dint make a move. But after a week or two of this, Charley finally asked her out. They had been dating for four months and were still head over heels for each other. 

 Amelia hit the home button  then quickly typed in her password, 2643 as her car came into sight. She opened her  text chain with Audrey and Millie, she quickly typed out “hey guys, know we haven’t hung out in a while wanna come to my apartment?” Her finger hovered over the send button then deleted it, instead typing “Wanna come over, i could use a good laugh.” Before Amelia could overthink it she hit the blue send button and heard the swoosh from the phone. Amelia ducked into her car and put her phone down on the passenger seat. She hit the steering wheel, trying to calm her nerves. She breathed out a sigh, her lips in a tight circle as she did so. Amelia put the keys in the ignition and put the car in drive.

 Right before she started to pull out she heard the familiar ding from her phone. Pausing, she reached over and picked up her phone. First seeing it was from Millie she smiled, looking down at it it read

“I'll bring cookies!” that text was followed with “be there in 20” with a thumbs up emoji a few seconds later.

 Hitting the gas Amelia pulled out of the stop and started towards her home. Bored, Amelia turned up the radio, and started to hum in unison to the beat of “Honey, Honey”.  Around half way home, when the houses began less frequent and the green trees becoming more familiar Amelia heard a bark from her phone, her text tone set as Duckling, her pitbull’s bark. Seeing the red stop light Amelia took a second to glance at her phone, Audrey

 had texted her back with a simple text of “Kk, I’m omw”.  

 **. . .**

When Amelia arrived home she plopped on her blue-green couch but now looked more blue-grey with age. Checking the clock it was now 2:43, now 2:44. She looked around and glanced at the door, a wood basic door with a silver handle. She waited for a second, maybe if she stared long enough it would turn. She debated turning on the tv and turning on an episode of *Friends*. Amelia decided against it; her friends would probably be here in only a few minutes. Feeling her stomach rumble she gently moved Duckling and dragged herself up moving through the double doors that separated the living room from the kitchen, though it was more of an arch, she couldn’t remember a time where she ever closed the doors. 

Grabbing the chips from the top of the fridge Amelia felt her tummy rumble again. Amelia took the bowl which lay in the cabinet next to the fridge. Amelia poured the chips into the bowl, behind her she heard the click of Duckling’s paws. Turning around, clips in hand,  she saw Duckling, his brown eyes were surrounded by his brown fur, a white blotch on his muzzle and another from his chin to his stomach. His little head was cocked to the left, his black nose shining. His eyes shined expectantly, as if asking where his own food was. Amelia let out a little “aww” but resisted the urge to dump the whole bowl in front of him. 

Then Amelia heard the doorbell rang, gasping; she quickly ran to the door, dropping a chip on the way. Duckling immediately gobbled it up like a vacuum on high power. Quickly she opened the door, squealing Amelia Audrey and Millie hugged each other. Millie had her hair up in a tight bun, with a cropped green shirt and black pants. Audrey wore her usual, hair down and an off the shoulder white oversized shirt and light blue jeans. 

“It’s been so long!” Millie spoke quickly, still squealing with excitement.

“Girl it’s only been a month!” Audrey pushed her playfully.

“Well that's still too long!” After a moment of silence between them, unusual, Amelia continued, “So are we planning on standing here all day or are you guys coming in?”

 “Yes! Yes!” Audrey said , hurring in.

“Hi Duckling!” Millie said as Amelia saw he was looking at the clear container with a red plastic cover covering the contents she was holding. Clearly Millie did too because Millie lifted it higher, “Sorry buddy- cookies aren't for doggies!” Duckling looked back, still hoping for a prize.” Another pause- Amelia winced to herself knowing how the last gathering went. When the two came to console her after Nana’s death she ended up yelling at them to leave. She felt bad but didn't know how to apologize though both Audrey and Millie said it was fine so she didn't say anything- and their group chat was quiet.

“So how have you guys been?” Amelia asked, breaking another awkward pause between them.

“Good, how about we go upstairs?” Though Amelia had broken the silence she worried how much time at her house would be spent in silence",1,1748234719.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

**Part 1**

I (Alex 29M) have been married to my wife (Olivia 29F) for 5 years.  We have been together for 7 years in total.  

We started together during my Senior year of college and ran in the same friends group, although I had known her for 2 years at that point (She was the sister of a girl who went to the college). I was supposed to be a rebound.  She had been in a relationship for the previous 3 years, even lived with the guy (who I was sort of friends with).  They had issues before they moved in together, and needless to say moving in together to fix issues wasn't a good idea.  Things got worse and he kicked her out of their apartment. Three days later she was riding me on my couch.  

Olivia had been single for around a combined month's worth of time since she was a Freshman in High School. All of her previous boyfriends had issues around sex, and my reputation proceeding itself, she figured I'd be a good candidate to have some fun with given her new found freedom.  She had never had a fling, and just wanted to use me like a friends with benefits thing.  I wasn't complaining, the sex was amazing. However, I had always kind of had a thing for her.  I just never acted on it because she had a boyfriend. I was smitten from that first night on my couch. Fortunately, she was not very good at maintaining any form of her own boundaries. It took her a month to really kiss me, but other than that, any time I asked her on any type of date she said yes. We were spending every available night together. After 6 weeks she asked me to be exclusive with her. I agreed.    

After college I got my ideal job as a social media manager. My now wife had been doing secretarial work since she was 19 and had just landed a spot at a High School.  

The first two years of dating and engagement were really fun and we connected in every way.  The whole thing was fast. We dated a year, engaged a year, and got married.  Our first year of married life was pretty good. We did a small vacation, bought a house, and had discussions on children (We agreed to not start until we were closer to 30).  

When Covid hit, I went to working from home. While the buildings were closed and most staff at home. The secretaries were still working in building.  It was during this time that we began to drift apart.  I just found the whole situation to be pretty easy.  I was still doing my job from the comfort of my basement office.  I found keeping the house clean was a breeze with it just being the two of us and her being gone most of the day. 

With some extra time on my hands, I got really into GTA Online. It was my new hobby.  I was playing quite a bit during that period of time.  When Olivia would get home, I was usually just getting into the ideal play time.  I tried including her in it but she wasn’t very interested in my new hobby. Since then I have expanded my variety of games, so I am online a fair amount of time each day.  

It was also during this time that some glaring communication issues became more and more evident. This problem has only gotten worse in the last 4 years since I went to work from home.  For example, for nearly 3 years she has been telling me that I don’t communicate with her.  Which is not true, I tell her everything that happens to me, which isn’t very much.  I work at home and my main hobby is here at home. There really isn’t that much to tell, so I don’t really understand why this is an issue. I think she has finally come to understand this as it hasn’t been brought up for months now.

This is just one problem we’ve been battling the last few years.  There are other things she is always going on about as well, like that I don't care about her or support her.  Which is ridiculous because I obviously do, I married her (wouldn’t have done that if I didn’t care), and even though I make way more than her now, I rarely splurge on myself, instead I encourage her to get the things she likes (She buys a ton of shit every month. We could literally survive off my salary now, she chooses to work.)  I have no idea what she wants, I work full time and do almost all the housework.

Those are the things she largely nags me about. Anytime we try to talk about any of our issues though, it just feels like I am supposed to sit there and take it.  She never wants to talk about any of the issues I see.  She just tells me I’m being defensive and hijacking the conversation.  Always telling me that I don’t say anything until she brings something up, and then suddenly it's a floodgate of problems I have with her. It’s not a floodgate and it’s nothing new.  It’s the same problems. She never just outright says what she wants or what she means. I have told her so many times I’m not going to pick up on stupid hints and half the time I have no idea what she wants.  She wants me to be “vulnerable”, what does that even mean, I’m not going to just randomly start crying.  

I think the biggest thing that shows me that she doesn’t care about me or like me at all, is complete lack of physical intimacy. Our sex life started to diminish right around the same time Covid hit.  The frequency just kept dropping and has continued to over the last 4 years. I was the only one ever initiating. The rejections built up more and more, eventually I just stopped trying.  Most of the time I don’t even come to bed anymore. Instead I just sleep on the couch down here in my office.         

Our problems aside, we’ve had some changes over the last few years. Three years ago I switched jobs. I’m still a social media manager, I just jumped from the small company I was working at to a much larger corporation. I had lots of reasons, I liked the people I worked with before but this was more money, better benefits, and 100% work from home.  My old company was planning a hybrid situation once Covid restrictions began relaxing.  Olivia also switched jobs 2 years ago, and became a secretary at another large company.  

About 6 months ago, a new entry level guy (Asher 23M)  began working at Olivia’s company.  At this same time she got a new iPhone. Like usual, I set her phone up for her. However, I had been suspecting that she was talking badly about me to her Mother and Sister. It just seemed like their overall mood towards me had soured. So, I am not proud of this, but while I was setting up her phone I also put some different types of “spying apps” on it, and synced everything into the cloud, which I then synced to my tablet.  

I did see her complain to her sister about our marriage. Her sister never really bashed me, just gave her advice.  A month ago though, is when I started to see her message with Asher.  It started off as just friendly office talk. Quickly that turned into “innocent” personal talk. They would discuss books they liked, tv shows, hobbies, and so on. They would do this for hours at a time. It definitely had me thinking something was going on, but at the same time if she just had a friend I figured it would be good for her, and keep her off my ass at least some. The last 2 weeks I have noticed she was in a better mood overall, that is also when their conversations took a steep turn into the inappropriate. It was quick too, they went from just discussing a love of Hunger Games to talking about what they wanted to do to each other in a single night. It only kept escalating from there, and this past Wednesday they met outside of work for the first time.  

She gave me the dumbest excuse too. Telling me she had to work late (She typically works 8:30 to 5pm) and she wasn’t sure how long she would have to work past 5pm. Even if I didn’t KNOW what she was up to, this would still be a red flag. She works under a very high up in the company, and he is literally the sweetest old man. I have met him twice, and she has never said one bad word about this guy.  So for him to suddenly require her to work for an undetermined amount of time past her normal hours, after two years in which she was never asked to do “extra” or “stay late,” was a red flag in itself.  

She told me that on Monday, and I decided I was just going to play it cool. See what happens. I didn’t want to burst her bubble and have her backtrack with all that “It was never physical” crap.  Wednesday came, she didn’t get home until around 8:15 pm and immediately hit the shower.  Normally she likes to snack first, workout, or sit down and scroll on her phone for a half hour.  She tried to come down to my office and talk to me, but I just ignored her. I knew what she did and I wasn’t interested in easing her conscience. I actually think I inadvertently did though, as she seemed to relax more just before she left. 

I guess the thing that is throwing me off is, I don’t really feel any which way about her cheating.  I feel like I should be pissed or hurt, but I’m just “meh.” I can’t really explain it. Later that night they exchanged a few messages but she was very short in response and was giving off the vibe that she didn’t want to talk with him. That changed the next day and they talked a lot more, including discussing how “amazing” the night before had been. Olivia told him that she was going to tell me that “Late Wednesdays” was going to be a regular thing going forward. She did just that yesterday.  

I am genuinely happy about this. This wasn’t a one off situation, she is having a full blown affair and I can prove it.  She had no power over me now. I don’t care what she is doing, so if she is trying to hurt me, she has failed. Now I can get out of this marriage and not be the “bad guy.”  I‘ve always assumed she would paint me negatively if we ever divorced, now she can try but at the end of the day, she cheated.  

I know I have let myself go a little bit physically, and of course there are things I could improve on, but everyone does. That doesn’t mean it's okay to go out and cheat, if you’re that unhappy go out and get a divorce first. I was planning on spending this day researching divorce attorney’s.  Olivia came into my office about 20 minutes ago and asked me to take her on a hike and picnic. I don’t know what she is getting at. I could see the shock on her face when I agreed to go.  I’m debating on whether or not to drop the bomb on her while we're out there or wait until we get back. I half expect she will ask for a divorce.     

**Part 2** 

I (Alex 29M) didn’t end up saying anything during the hike. Neither did my wife (Olivia 29F). It was actually a really nice day. We hiked, we joked, we talked. It was like being on a first date.  She had packed a picnic filled with my favorite snacking foods. I just kept expecting her to ask for a divorce or come clean about the affair and beg for forgiveness. It didn’t happen. When we were done we drove home.

When we got home I went down to my office and started up a game. She went and showered. I was sitting there playing when she walked in and said, “I’m ordering take out from the Japanese place, then I’m going to watch Abigail. I would like it if you watched it with me, but you don’t have to if you are busy, either way what do you want to eat.” I told her, she left the room, and I went back to my game. I was planning on just gaming through the night, I had already missed a lot of time going out with her during the day. Then I started feeling guilty about not watching the movie with her. I ended up leaving my game when she came back with the food. We ate and watched Abigail together. When we were done eating she moved over closer and we cuddled on the couch together. I couldn’t even remember the last time we had a day or night like that one.

The next day on Sunday I was gaming, and I just kind of started to feel bored with it. I went into our home gym, if you want to call it that. It’s a treadmill and set of dumbbells going up from 5 lbs to 50 lbs. I worked out for the first time in probably three years. I went back to gaming afterwards but it did feel good.  

On Monday, when she got home I came back upstairs and asked her how her day was. We ended up talking for 2 hours about random stuff like work and what’s going on with her friends. She made us both dinner and picked out a new show for us to binge.  We didn’t make it but halfway through episode 2 and we were getting it on right there on the living room couch. We hadn’t had sex in at least 5 months at this point, well, I guess that’s only true for me. 

Tuesday was much of the same. I had no idea what was going on but she was putting real effort into our relationship, and in return I began to do the same. When Wednesday rolled around I wondered if she would “work late” or not. I monitored her messages during the day and while they are few and far between when they are at work, the ones that were there did indicate she intended to go to his place that night. Which is exactly what she did.  For the 2 hours or so she was there I sat and wondered. I wondered why it didn’t bother me. It made no sense, I should be very angry that she is banging some other guy literally right at that moment. It didn’t though. I don’t want to give the wrong idea, I also got no pleasure or excitement from the knowledge either. I felt nothing. My feelings were literally no different than if she were out getting her nails done, or at Starbucks having a coffee with a friend.  

When she got back home after that second time, I was going to confront her. I had no doubt about what transpired, his graphic text to her on her way home really didn’t leave much to the imagination. Like the previous week, she went straight to the shower upon arrival. I waited in the bedroom for her to come out. Olivia walked out into the room wrapped in her towel. I had a somber look on my face. I kept thinking about how great the previous few days had been, but I still needed to confront her. When I saw her though she looked literally amazing, and actually happy. I was so used to her sulking. I had noticed this change slowly after her affair started.  She was much more like the Olivia I had fallen in love with 7 years ago. When she looked at me her face turned to concern, actual affectionate concern for me. She approached quickly, put her hand on my back and asked me what was wrong in a sweet voice. I looked at her, I actually felt a well of tears begin to form, but I pushed that down. I decided not to say anything. I told her I had a rough day with work and just needed some reassurance. She loved on me with some shoulder rubs and we talked about it. I got up and went to get her some food I had prepped earlier. As I was leaving she said “You know all those times, I told you I wanted you to open up to me, or be vulnerable?  This is what I meant. You don’t have to face everything alone, I want to be part of your life.”  I nodded and left. 

After that night, I started to really think about our relationship, and just about myself as a whole.  Ever since Covid hit I really haven’t done anything.  I barely talked to my parents, I had lost connection with all of my friends.  I was horribly out of shape, especially for a guy who had always been the “fit guy”.  I decided if she was going to put effort into our relationship then I should as well.  I began to look into some relationship books, I also designed myself a workout plan.  

All of that was almost 6 months ago now and I can report I don’t think I have been happier than I am now. I really enjoy the routine of our lives. Sunday and Friday are do your own thing nights. On Mondays and Tuesdays we hang out around the house with each other, one day she picks what we watch the other day I pick. Wednesday is when she “works late”. I have reconnected with some friends and we have a weekly D&D night. I had never played before but I’ve gotten really into it. They are all seasoned players but I am coming along. Typically I am also out later than she is, which I prefer. Thursday and every other Saturday are “Date Nights”. We usually just go to a movie or dinner on Thursday. Saturday we do something fun, like hit a museum or go hiking. On the “other Saturday” is for us to do our own thing on our own. I sometimes go out on these days but usually this is where I do my gaming. I barely play through the week now and have gotten into pretty good shape by replacing it with working out.  She could be doing any number of things on these days. Sometimes she is with Asher, I get annoyed sometimes because she lies to me about where she is going. I just smile and nod but I know what she is actually doing.  She also uses these days to visit family or just have some alone time.  

I know what everyone is going to say, how can you be okay with her cheating?  I don’t have a good answer. It just doesn’t bother me. I had some person reach out to me on my last post and tell me they think I might be poly. I just don’t think that’s the case, I have no interest in pursuing anyone else. For whatever reason, I am just indifferent to the fact of her infidelity. I also really want to stress the indifferent part. I’ve had so many in the comments imply that I “get off” on this. I don’t. I feel no excitement, no pleasure, no jealousy, no embarrassment (this might be different if it were public knowledge, but it's not.) 

I still hope that the affair just ends. If it does I'll never say anything, and we can just go about the rest of our marriage. I know at some point I’m going to have to force it to stop, we will want kids eventually and I am only doing that if we can be 100%.  In the meantime, I’m just going to keep enjoying my life.

**Part 3**            

Before I (Alex 31M) get into the problem, I’m going to give a quick update on what the last year and half since my last post has been like.  It’s been great.  We have really reconnected as a couple. We’ve been on a few vacations, I am spending more time with friends and family, and our communication has never been better.  She (Olivia 31F) is still seeing Asher (25M), and still lying about it. I pay very little attention to that. I haven’t looked at her messages with anyone in probably the last year. Honestly, I don’t know how she keeps up with it. I figured out from their messages, and assuming they are still going like this, that she sleeps with Asher 1-3 times a week. I know from first hand experience she sleeps with me 3-5 times a week. That does not include the random “messing around” we do. 

Now I don’t want it to seem like we don’t still have arguments and disagreements. We fight a little bit, some of our old issues creep back in there sometimes. The difference is now we talk them out, we get over them faster, and we show each other respect when we share our feelings.

Our current issues began when I noticed that my wife had been on the phone quite a bit with a friend of hers (Codie 31F).  After the 3rd or 4th consecutive day of her being on the phone with this friend for upwards of an hour, I finally had to ask what was going on. Codie just figured out that her husband (Channing 32M) was having an affair for the last 3 months. They have been married for 10 years.  Making matters worse, his affair partner is Codie’s 19 year old first cousin (Micayla).  I went back and looked through Olivia’s messages with Codie and unless she has said it over the phone, Olivia has not let Codie know that she is having an affair.  

Everything would have been fine if I could have kept my dumb mouth shut. Olivia went into this tirade about how awful Channing was for being an adulterer. I was shaking my head with a dumb grin on my face, when she noticed. Olivia kind of snapped, “What you don’t agree?” I couldn’t contain it and blurted out, “You’re one to talk.” Her whole demeanor changed, and she started to press me for what I was talking about. I at first tried to deny it and apologize. She wasn’t having it, she just kept pressing me. That’s when I told her that I knew about her affair with Asher.  

She asked me how long and I said the entire time it’s been going, back when it was just innocent messages about work. She asked me why I just let it go on, and I told her, “Because I didn’t care.” She completely broke down crying and ran into our bedroom at that point. She locked the door behind her. It was pretty late at night at this point. I was messaging her trying to get a response, trying to get her to talk to me about what just happened. She only sent me one message that read, “Please leave me alone, I need time.” I slept on the couch in the basement for the first time in over a year. 

The next morning she left for work earlier than normal. I checked her messages.  She contacted Asher that night and ended things with him. He was blowing up her phone trying to get answers and she was blocking him on everything he tried. When she got home that night I was waiting.  She just looked at me and went into our bedroom. She locked the door behind her. I went to sleep on the couch again and was awoken at around 1am. She came in and laid down next to me and just cried. I held her for maybe 15-20 minutes while she just let it all out. She began apologizing profusely, and self-deprecating. I told her to stop, that she wasn’t all these horrible things she was saying. I knew, and I didn’t say anything. I didn’t think less of her and still loved her completely. She asked me how I knew and I came clean about my surveillance apps. She was hurt by this but strongly conflicted. She was telling me she felt this intense invasion of privacy that she was having a hard time processing. At the same time she was betraying me, and feels that she deserved this.I asked why she locked herself away for 2 days. She told me, “When you said, “I don’t care” it just all flooded into me all at once.I spent years believing you didn’t care about me, it was just too much at that moment.” It was a crazy and emotional conversation but we eventually fell asleep together on my couch. .  

She took the next two days off and we went over everything that had happened in our relationship. We talked about how bad things got after Covid. My indifference and unwillingness to change. My surveillance of her phone. We talked about how much I have changed over the last couple years.  We spent a huge amount of time going over her affair, more details than I actually cared to hear, which was surprising because I hadn’t had even the slightest emotional response up until this point.  

I asked her why she started the affair, and she said because he paid attention to her, but also she assumed we would be divorcing. She loved the attention and validation, especially after years of being ignored. She remembers she would try to get me to do things with her, even things that I “used to” like. I would usually turn her down, and on the rare occasions that I didn’t it was always like I wanted to hurry through it so I could get back home and get back on my games.  She was totally right about my behavior at that time. I should also say she wasn’t trying to justify her behavior, just explain to me what she was thinking at the time. After she slept with him for the first time she knew we needed to divorce. She got this idea for one last “test” to see if our relationship was even remotely salvageable. That was when she invited me on the hike and picnic. She never thought in a million years would I agree to go. When I did she was shocked, but also figured I’d be trying to make it quick. Then I didn’t and we had a wonderful day. She thought she should continue to make an effort, and all of sudden I was responding and making an effort myself. I interjected during this part and asked, “Why after everything got better between us, did you keep up with the affair.”  

She held nothing back in her responses, “I was just selfish, I liked having it all and didn’t want it to stop. I actually feel bad for stringing him along, I am pretty sure he is in love with me.” 

I cut in once more, “And how did you feel about him?”  

Olivia, “I definitely had…have feelings for him, but not like with you.  I guess you could call it love like, but really what I loved was the attention and I didn’t want to give it up. Once I had you back, and we were really enjoying each other again, I knew I should end things, but I didn’t want to. I was spending time with the man I loved, and that meant a ton to me, but I was also selfish, and allowing this other person to shower me with attention. I used all the cliche justifications to myself: Coming clean will just hurt Alex, I’m in too deep to stop, I deserve it, and so on.”  

I asked, “Did you ever feel guilty?”

Olivia, “All the time, but having it all was more important to me.” 

I responded, “Did you have it all?” 

She continued, “In my mind I did, if I’m being totally open, yeah I think I did. I had you, and we were enjoying each other more than we had since we were dating. I had my space and free time, then I also had this guy who wanted nothing more than to shower me with attention. You were both so different, I liked sleeping with both of you.  We were back to our wild kinky crazy stuff that you know I’m into, and he was the opposite: simple, attentive, kind of sensually vanilla. Not that we don’t do passionate, but it was just different.”                     

I was pretty worn out after this conversation, and we had several more over the weekend. It was Sunday afternoon, and Asher was still trying to get ahold of Olivia. I told her she should call him, and give some sort of closure. She fully agreed.  When she called she put it on speaker and I remained silent just listening. 

She explained to him that I had found out about the affair, but not that I knew the whole time.  That she was committing fully to her marriage and we were going to work through all of our issues (She admitted to me that after things got better she stopped talking about our marriage to him). He begged her to reconsider and said he loved her, you could tell that he really did. He truly believed through all of this that they would end up together, and had bought into the idea that she was just waiting for the right time to divorce me.  I kind of felt sorry for him. As she tried to reassure him, and convince him that he needed to move on, he began to get a bit confrontational. Eventually he made a veiled threat at telling me everything. She told him that I already knew all about it and that she had come completely clean. She quickly ended the conversation after this and blocked him once again.  

The next week while Olivia was at work I heard a knock on the door. It was Asher. I stepped out to talk to him. I wasn’t worried about a physical confrontation, I’ve got 3 inches and probably 40lbs on the guy. He just started showing me evidence of their affair, he seemed a little manic. I told him to stop, I tried to be as empathetic as possible, but honestly didn’t really care if he was upset. I told him I always knew about their affair and he could just save it. I figured it out when it started. I just didn’t say anything or stop her because I didn’t care. He was dumbfounded, and just turned and left. I told Olivia what happened and she went into a bit of a doom spiral.  

That’s kind of been the norm the last few weeks, I am getting a little worn out from it. She got us some “Recovering from Infidelity” books and we’ve been reading them together, because she thinks we should. The thing is it’s all ass backwards. Like I’m the betrayed partner and she is the wayward partner, yet I spend all the time trying to reassure her. She has these huge crashes and triggers, and I’m the one trying to anticipate this stuff. She wants to talk, and check in on me, and make sure I’m fine, but I processed all this a long time ago. It's old news to me and I’m ready to get back to our routines. I have missed my last 3 D&D Wednesdays, didn’t go to the fights last weekend even though that night had been planned for 2 months. I’m trying to be a good partner here, but the irony of the situation is not unnoticed.  

I’m thinking of putting in some hard boundaries in regards to “Affair talk.” I am also pushing her to come clean to her sister. I need someone else to shoulder the burden of keeping Olivia together. Olivia and her Sister (Cam 34f) have always been really close.  

I think in the long term we will be fine, I just needed to vent through this rough patch.

I’m looking for a POS system for my mobile coffee trailer. It’s a little unique, so I’ll detail my ideal setup and I’d love to hear what you guys would recommend as far as; price, ease of use, functionality, etc. Thanks in advance!

Our Setup
- We only do venues( weddings, graduation, etc) 2-4 hrs normally 
- I’d love to have %100 orders taken from self order kiosk/qr codes 
- No customers will PURCHASE anything( meaning, I need the self order to ring up as $0.00) like Wawa, Sheets if you know those.
- The host won’t necessarily need to pay through the POS if It saves me fees
- I’ll need the orders to show up in my trailer to know what to make
- Optionally, I’d love to have a sticker print to put on the cup with name and order (afterthought)

1kvllie,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kvllie/nf_how_do_i_live/,[NF] How do I live?,"Never in my life did Hussein support an idea of mine. Every plan, goal—hell, even word—about my future was ridiculed into an early grave. 

“There are more ways to live than by thinking about it, you know,” he would say. 

“Thinking about what?” 

“About living it.”

So I would pester him. Clearly, he was a billion-year samsara veteran, seeing the world with eyes unclouded. “The best of life is unplanned,” he would tell me.

Hussein painted animals. Only elephants, for most of his life. In fact, if it wasn’t for me harassing him for a giraffe, a lion, a touch of color to fight the sea of grey, he never would have changed.

 “There you have it.”

 ""Have what?"" I say.   
“You were an unplanned part of me. And yet, no matter how hard I try, you never leave.”   
“Okay, sure, but that’s different. People come and go. Plans can stay—even with people’s presence and absence.”

I carry the absence of many with me. Not just those close. Not just the friends whose familiar voices strung my favorite chords across my soul. Not the family who, even at their worst, saw the best in me.

I carry the absence of strangers. The woman who gave me directions with a laugh that lingered. The man whose silence on a crowded train made me feel oddly understood. Every girl whose eyes felt like nostalgia and wore the scent of avoidable tragedy. Faster than the subway, she would enter and leave my life, unloading invisible passengers that never make themselves known—until I call out for them.

I carry the burden of the coffee I forgot to drink. I love coffee. I never wish I did. It was an accident, you see—after going cold turkey on all the nicotine, alcohol, and weed, I needed something to keep me going. Now, crawling out of bed sounds like hell without the bitterness I deserve crawling down my throat.

I bear that burden as I try not to fall asleep, listening to Hussein ramble in his tent. His canvas walls flap gently in the wind. I’m in his chair, fingers wrapped around a chipped mug. Maybe if I had planned better, we wouldn’t be here. 

“I didn’t plan on my daughter,” he said. “I didn’t plan her existence, but I wouldn’t be anywhere without her.”

Parenthood is a different conundrum. A child might peel back the corners of my soul that I dog-eared long ago—passages I meant to return to. Highlighted words I skimmed, marked *Poignant*, then ignored. But even then—if I can barely commit to a single routine, what says I can commit to a child?

“I just need time to think about things, is all,” I finally mutter.

 “Time?” he says. “Time is a luxury man could never afford. It's a bank built on interest, and one day you’ll pay with everything you’ve got. If you spend half your life planning your full life, you’ll be sad when you run out of time.”

I always run out of time, don’t I? In school, I'd hover my pencil over the last question, the one that sounded like it came from a stranger’s mouth. I'd stare until the bell rang, hoping my silence would make the teacher understand that I wasn’t—and never would be—ready.

I ran out of time on love. I saw the subway doors open and knew I could make it—but I didn’t run. Do I trip? Or do I go slower than I can because I’m scared?

“We all run out of time,” I say. “Is it so wrong to try to do something with it?” 

“No,” he says. “But the more you try, the more you fuck yourself chasing the final destination. Enjoy the ride. Enjoy the company. Get off at the next stop—or ride three more stations. Hell, maybe even get off and take a taxi.

Every path has a trailblazer—but all that separates them from anyone else is a will and a way.”

Hussein walked away from me, back to his easel. His brush strokes blurred into something wild and bright. His soul on canvas.

I leaned back. The tent smelled like old paint and incense.

“So what do I do now?” I asked. “Go home? Unenroll? Find a passion and keep it? What if I want to do something meaningful?”

He turned to me, with the weight of the world in his eyes. “Meaning comes from within. It’s not about how many people you touch. It’s about how deeply.”



A woman at a train stop. Heavyset, slow-talking, going somewhere I wasn’t. People stared, confused—two strangers hugging over a Coke and a half-eaten burger. She asked for money. I gave her food. I hoped it would appease, and it did. She reached into me and tugged on my soul. I wish I hadn’t closed it on her hand.



The book of my soul has been read by few, and understood by fewer.

Privacy’s a hard thing to hold when the world watches from your pocket—from every wall, every doorbell. People call me paranoid. Say I’m a stranger and a friend, Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing myself for control at all times.

The last time someone turned the pages, they tore them out. She was a great gal. Hair that framed her face like a watercolor in the rain. Eyes deeper than the loch, the ocean, the sea. Their blue looked like *I will never leave.* They always had.

I loved her like I love coffee. Like I love art. Like music in a dark room. I once listened to Sinatra hum his inhuman talent into my ears for a week straight. I’ve been to every gallery, flea market, and museum of art on the East Coast.

But not even Hussein’s giraffe ever touched me like she did. When she ran, she took the page that taught me how to love. Her touch still lingers.





Self-reflection got me nowhere in eighteen years. I don’t know why I thought it would start now.

I stood, shook Hussein’s hand, and walked into the market. The smell of spice and citrus hung in the air.

Maybe it isn’t the journey. Or the destination. Maybe it’s what we do to keep moving.

Maybe it’s every conscious and unconscious act that carries us over a fallen tree, or down a new trail because a bridge snapped. Maybe, because the bridge snapped, you found a field. Maybe you stopped to smell the flowers. Maybe you met someone else at that same bridge—and decided to travel together.

Maybe I carry a hundred pages from the souls of others—what they taught me, what I took, what I gave. Maybe they carry a piece of me too.

We adapt. We evolve. Minute by minute. Every plan I make is outdated the second I make it.

But first— I need coffee.

# 🔬 1. Backed by Science: Health Benefits of Coffee

Numerous **peer-reviewed studies** confirm that coffee—when enjoyed in moderation—offers several **science-backed health benefits**:

*""Caffeine in coffee interacts with neurotransmitters to improve alertness and may lower the risk of cognitive decline.""*

# ❤️ Supports Heart Health

According to a **2021 study published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology**, drinking **2–3 cups of coffee per day** was associated with a **reduced risk of heart disease and stroke**.

""Moderate coffee consumption was linked with a longer lifespan and lower cardiovascular risk,"" says lead researcher Prof. Peter Kistler.

# 🧬 Rich in Antioxidants

Coffee is one of the **biggest sources of antioxidants** in the modern diet, even more than fruits and vegetables for some people. Antioxidants help fight **free radicals** and reduce **inflammation**, which is linked to many chronic diseases.

# 🩸 May Reduce Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

Harvard research found that people who increased their coffee intake by **more than one cup per day** over four years had an **11% lower risk** of developing Type 2 diabetes.

·         Insomnia

·         Anxiety

·         Digestive discomfort

·         Heart palpitations

# ❌ Not Ideal for Pregnant Women

The **American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists** recommends limiting caffeine to **200 mg/day** during pregnancy to reduce risks.

“Moderate coffee consumption is safe and may even be beneficial for most people,”  
— **Dr. Frank Hu**, Professor of Nutrition and Epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

I’m in my 27f and I have a younger half-sister who’s 23f. She lived out of the country with her dad and grandparents until a few years ago, then moved in with me, my mom, and stepdad who i refer to as my dad. A couple years ago, I had my first child. Not long after, my sister also became a mom. Since having her daughter (which it’s been said multiple times to me that there was a huge assumption she couldn’t handle me having all of the attention having a baby, the first one out of my sibling/cousins to continue on the family bloodline) she hasn’t held a stable job, still lives at home, has no social life, and has always struggled with friendships. I worked and saved to move out on my own for the sake of my child. She, on the other hand, hasn’t made any effort to get her life together. She’s been lying to her grandmother (who still lives out of the country), telling her she works at a daycare and that her daughter goes there with her. This isn’t true. The grandmother sends her money regularly covering her phone bill, sending money for baby supplies, etc. A while ago, her grandmother (that I haven’t seen in a decade, or have ever really spoken to) came to me confused about why my sister constantly asks her for money (worried about drug use and as far as we all know there is none besides the occasional joint like 2x a month), and I told her the truth, she hasn’t worked in a long time, and the baby’s never been in daycare. The real problem is the way she lives. Her room is disgusting. There are dirty diapers piled up, dishes filled with old urine hidden under blankets, used feminine products left out, it’s a health hazard. My dad says the floor is soaked and the smell is unbearable. He also discovered human waste in bowls and coffee mugs…. My niece sleeps in this room. In a bed that is filled with trash. My parents have tried getting her to clean, but it never lasts more than a day or two. My dad is beyond done. He wants her out. But every time he says anything, my mom defends her and says he’s being too harsh. It’s like no one knows how to handle her. I’ve told him to talk to our grandmother or even kick her out, but nothing changes. Everyone’s walking on eggshells. My sister is also super controlling when it comes to her daughter. She doesn’t let anyone babysit not even our parents. She took the baby’s father to court trying to get full custody, and that failed. Now they have shared custody, and she gets a very small amount in child support. The court process cost our grandmother tens of thousands, and for what?? She didn’t even get what she so strongly thought the judge would award her. 

At this point, I don’t want my own kids going to my parents’ house because it’s not safe. But everyone is too afraid to call CPS. I’m not afraid, but I just don’t want to bring on the chaos that would follow. Still, I can’t ignore what’s going on, I feel beyond guilty for not protecting my niece, she doesn’t deserve to live in that kind of environment.

So Reddit:
	•	What can be done to force her to grow up and be responsible?
	•	Could this be some kind of mental health issue or just entitlement?
	•	Is calling CPS the only realistic option left?
	•	How do I get through to my mom, who keeps enabling all of this?

Any honest advice or personal experience would help. I’m exhausted and just want what’s best for everyone involved.. especially the kids. ",4,1748233648.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

1kvlg3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kvlg3x/mf_the_axe/,[MF] The Axe,"“What kind of weather are we expecting?” Finn asked Captain Oliver as they packed the cargo onto the boat.

“Well, it’s clear right now and should be for the next few hours, but based on those clouds over there I’d say it could be a storm tonight.”  
  
“Worried?”  
  
“Not at all. A storm’s not so bad so long as we have the proper equipment,”

“You mean like this axe?” asked Finn as he gestured to an old woodcutting axe that sat next to the supplies.

“Certainly! This axe here saved my life when I was no older than you are today. It was a terrible shipwreck and if not for the old thing I’d have drowned while trapped in the lower decks. But that’s a story for another time, go untie the ship from the dock.”

Finn untied the rope as Oliver let down the sails. Finn was thrilled for what was his first real voyage not only without a large crew but where he would help in meaningful ways. He had only ever mopped, swept, and moved cargo before. This was his first real step to one day living a life on the seas delivering cargo to new and strange places. Oliver on the other hand was less than thrilled about the voyage. He found the entire thing to be beneath his paygrade. He was an experienced Captain and had done such work for most of his life. While he’d never admit it he was rather old and the simple thought of wasting his time on such a trip irked him to no end. It was not even his idea to go on such a trip he was tricked into it while at the tavern in a drunken stupor just two nights before. Nevertheless, he was far from one to admit he was or could be wrong, and as such Oliver found the cheapest partner he could for the trip and prepared to set sail immediately. 

The first three days went smoothly. There was no storm nor unforeseen mishaps, outside of Finn spilling Oliver’s morning coffee on the second day. While he was disappointed with the job’s pay, Oliver did find himself enjoying the less stressful and busy environment a two-man crew offered, even if he found Finn to be as dull as a spoon. The voyage was expected to last three weeks, it would be the longest voyage Finn had ever been on and the shortest voyage Oliver had taken in years. This news had both parties thrilled.

On the fifth day, tensions began to rise. Finn had entirely misread navigation and the voyage would now last an extra two days. Oliver was furious at the idea of being late and even more furious that Finn could mess up such a simple task. He swore that Finn would have a large cut of his pay removed for such an inexcusable mistake. Oliver attempted to course-correct themselves but soon gave up and accepted his seven-year streak of never being late would be broken. Much like Oliver, Finn was also having a terrible day. His captain Oliver had put him in charge of navigation without proper training while his captain chose to instead take a nap. Personally, Finn considered only being two days late despite his lack of training in navigation to be a pretty good win on his part. Oliver made it clear he did not see this the same way. 

To celebrate a week out at sea, Finn made a glorious dinner for himself and the captain on day seven. It included a large ham, a plate of garlic bread, two separate lime broiled catfish, and a plate of diced fruit for dessert. It wasn’t his best work and it had taken him an entire afternoon to cook, but he was proud of his little feast. He rang the bell signalling that food was ready and sat down eagerly awaiting Captain Oliver’s arrival. He figured even that bitter old codger would be thrilled to have more than a single fish, two slices of bread, and an apple for dinner again.

The loud thumping of Captain Oliver’s boots could be heard before he was seen and as could his constant self muttering. 

“The blasted boy hasn’t much sense but these last two days he’s been improving. Who knows, maybe he has a chance at success afterall, despite ruining my seven year perfect record. I don’t got enough time to fix that at this point,” he finished saying as he arrived into the dinning area. At the sight of the feast Oliver’s jaw dropped to the floor, he stood motionless as though frozen into a statue, and the color drained from his skin. Finn was too distracted by his excitement to notice any of this.  
  
“I’ve made a feast Captain Oliver, to celebrate one week out at see.”  
  
“A feast? Is that what you call this?”  
  
“Well, yes sir. I suppose it could have been better, we just travelled so light and I didn’t have enough food to make it any better-” Finn was quickly cut off by Oliver’s bellowing howl.  
  
“Didn’t use enough food? That’s the issue you see here? I think you used plenty of food, in fact I doubt we have enough left to last till’ the end of the week!”  
  
Finn’s smile dropped. As his skin turned pale and his hands became shaky  he looked back at the table of food he had already prepared. He tried to utter an apology but could only stumble out the words “didn’t think” and “sorry” repeatedly.   
  
Oliver sat down at the table and began to eat. “For what it’s worth, it’s a damn good last meal,” he said beckoning Finn to join him.  
  
“Is there anyway we can salvage it? Or maybe we could catch more fish? Or it’s only two more weeks, maybe the food won’t go bad in that time?” spit out Finn talking fast in an attempt to hide the trembling in his voice.  
  
“Just enjoy the meal boy, it really is a good meal.”  
  
Week two began with a bang as Oliver smashed two kitchen pots together to wake up Finn extra early.

“Get up quick boy, it doesn’t look good outside. The rain has already started and it looks like it’ll get far worse before it gets better.”

“I thought you weren’t worried about storms?”

“That was when we were properly prepared, and at this moment we’re far from that.”

Oliver smashed the pots together one more time before dropping them on the ground and preparing the ship for a storm. Before he went back to readying the ship Oliver looked at his lucky axe hanging on the wall and muttered to himself about how it needs to start working fast.

Finn had never been in more than a light rain while at sea and certainly had never dealt with a storm while already doomed to starve before. Still shaken by the previous night, he forced himself out of bed and onto the deck to begin readying the ship. 

Soon the wind began to howl and scream as lightning broke across the sky, thunder cracked, and the water became rageful and violent as though it were out for revenge. Oliver attempted to navigate and keep the ship on course while Finn readjusted the sails. After a near miss from a bolt of lighting striking just five feet away from him, Oliver had dropped and lost the compass leaving him without a way to navigate. As the storm continued to get worse and worse. Oliver cursed to himself before yelling to Finn.

“Roll up the sails and get inside!”

“What?”

“The sails, roll them up and get below deck!”

Finn didn’t respond that time. Complaining to himself, Oliver grabbed his lantern and made his way to the sails to fetch the boy. A flash of sapphire blue light lit up the sky as a bolt of lightning struck the crows nest sending it crashing down on top of Oliver’s left leg. After a quick but powerful howl of pain, Oliver, thoroughly annoyed but not quite surprised considering the voyage so far, began calling for Finn with much more colorful language now. 

Finn stumbled about blindly unable to see more than a foot or so infront of him due to the rain and lack of any light. Finally hearing Captain Oliver’s voice he began slowly creeping into it’s direction until he saw a lanterns light. 

“Captain Oliver are you okay? What happened?”

“The mast was struck, now get this thing off of me and lets get inside!”

“I don’t think I’ll be able to lift it, but I have an idea,” Finn yelled ovet the storm as he left with the lantern.

No more than five minutes later Finn was back and carrying Captain Oliver’s lucky axe in one hand. It shimmered in the lantern light as the light bounced off it’s metal blade accentuating the intricate engravings Captain Oliver had added to the blade. With a heavy heave Finn brought the axe down hard straight through the railing of the crows nest. With another two hits the axe dug into the mast. “Careful with that thing! It’s your head if you break it!” Captain Oliver yelled out. With a third and final swipe Finn sent the axe straight throught the what remained of the fallen mast and into the deck. However, as he brough the axe back up the blade was wedged too deep into the deck and the old wood of the handle snapped as he brought it up from the swing. Not seeming to notice, Finn helped up Captain Oliver and brought him to the lower deck while the blade of the axe remained outside buried in the floor of the deck.

“Look what you’ve done!” Oliver began to bellow. “You made us late for delivery, then you doomed us, and now I can’t even die with my own lucky axe because you’ve managed to break that too!”

“I saved you! It was an old brittle axe and I’m sure it can be fixed if we-”

“Fixed? Who’s gonna fix it? We won’t see shore again, you ensured that long ago now! After this storm blows over, if I’m not dead I’d appreciate it if you’d left me alone to drink myself away, thank you very much.”

Finn and Oliver fell silent for a long while the stormed raged on outside.

The storm lasted for two days, by the end of which there was only food left for both of them to eat for three more days if they both rationed out meals. Without anyway of knowing where they were at sea or anyway of surviving the voyage outside of being saved by another passing by ship, the two gave up on continuing to steer the ship or attempting to deliver the cargo. While Oliver seemed content with using his last few days to drink his emergency alcohol he kept under the floorboards of his quarters, Finn had another idea. He was too young and had too much to live for to willingly sit down and die on this trip, especially when he was stuck with such a hateful crew mate. 

Finn went out onto the deck for the first time in two days and found the blade of the axe. With the blade of the axe he cut out a section of the sail to use to tie the head of the axe back onto the handle. He’s never been very good with knots or tying things, so this task alone took him the better part of an hour. It was worth it thoug, he thought. Wouldn’t Captain Oliver, the spiteful old dog, be thrilled to see his lucky axe back to a usable condition. He took the newly fixed axe and brought to the kitchen where he used a pot to begin sharpening it. It wasn’t the best tool for the job and it took a while, but by the end the blade was sharp enough to split a hair. Now he just had to show Captain Oliver, that malevolent old man, his work.

Holding the refurbished axe by his side in one hand, he knocked on the door to the captain’s quarters three times before the great Captain Oliver drunkenly crept to the door and cracked it open. 

“What do you want? Didn’t I tell you to leave me alone?”

“Well yes, however I have a gift for you. I’ve spent all day on it.”

“I don’t want it, knowing you it’ll just make things worse.”

“I don’t know if that’s exactly true. It’s your axe, I’ve fixed it up as best I could. Mind if I come in?”

There was a moment of silence before the door creaked the rest of the way open revealing the captains quarters. Despite only being a day, the once well kept captains quarters had quickly become a mess as papers littered the floor, a empty bottled were strewn about, and a broken glass from a shattered wine bottle littered the floor occasionally glintering as the light from a single candle next to the bed shone on it. 

“Well, the axe?  Doesn’t look so well from here, let me get a better look at it.”

“Of course,” replied Finn with a wicked smile curling onto his face. He slowly lifted the axe into both hands and above his head. In one quick decisive motion Finn brought the axe down blade first into Captain Oliver’s head. Down the blade went between the eyes, swiftly the newly sharpened blade cut into the skin, before crushing the skull and embedding itself into Captain Oliver’s brain.

Finn looked down at the bloody mess he had caused. It was for the better he told himself. They were going to die there anyway, and even if they weren’t the old man would just drink himself to death anyway. It was better for himself to have all the food, survive as long as he could he told himself. Finn walked outside, axe still in hand, and sat down at the railing. 

“I had to do it,” he began saying to himself. “It was him or me, and he’d have done the same. I know him, he was a hateful old man who would have done the exact same to me if he had only thought of it sooner,” he muttered to himself.

When sunset finally began to come, Finn still sat in the same place muttering the same excuses to himself until he heard something miraculous. He heard the sound of singing and music playing nearby. Finn jerked his head to his right and left searching for the source of the music. He saw just behind the late captain Oliver’s ship was a new ship about to pass by. Through an unimaginable effort of yelling, jumping, and even throwing things, Finn got the attention of the other ship.   
  
“Excuse me,” began the captain of this new ship as he boarded the late captain Oliver’s ship, “but is that a bloody axe over there? And where is the rest of your crew? What exactly happened here?”  
  
Finn froze for a moment trying to think of an excuse he could use. Some way he could explain everything away and get off scott free. People died at see all the time afterall he thought, it won’t be that unbelievable that Captain Oliver simply died. But that was ridiculous, the bloody axe is next to me and they’d have to be blind to notice Captain Oliver’s head was cracked open like a coconut.   
  
“Do you have any explanation?” asked this new captain as his men began to raise their firearms.  
  
“Of course I do, while tragically lost at sea dear old Captain Oliver had finally gone mad and attempted to kill me. I had to do what I had to do to survive that was all,” began Finn ready to make up any story to get him out of this mess.",1,1748233237.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Hoping to explore more shops this time. Any recommendations?

I'm staying at the Drift Inn, and thinking about eating there for dinner. It seems to get pretty good reviews.  I ate at Luna Sea last year, but prefer not to go there again. I love me some fried seafood at the coast, but the prices seemed a little crazy for what it was. Hoping maybe the Drift Inn will actually feel special or ""worth it""?

More importantly, looking for a good breakfast option. I know Drift Inn serves breakfast, but if I eat dinner there it seems redundant to do breakfast. Looking for light breakfast fare, especially good coffee and pastries. Sit down is fine, as long as I can grab some pastries for the road.

Lastly, I realize I've timed this over a holiday and it may be busy with a lot of traffic, but I'm okay with that. Any events going on for the holiday?

ETA: Green Salmon and Bread and Roses sound amazing and exactly something I'd love, but they're not open on Tuesdays. I'm open to other favorite coffee shops, bakeries, or sit down breakfast recommendations.

If I can't find a morning place, I may just end up getting breakfast at the Drift Inn by default due to lack of good options in town. In this case, I'd be open to finding another spot to try for dinner. As amazing as the Drift Inn restaurant sounds, I was really looking to sample a bit of what Yachats had to offer.

# Moby Dick: Chapters 114 - Epilogue (136)

This week's section segues back into more of the straightforward adventure tale we got at the beginning of the novel.

More gams. Gam with The Bachelor, a ship sailing back after their successful whaling. Gam with The Rachel is looking for a lost whaleboat, including the Captain's son, and The Delight, a ship that has lost a bunch of crewmembers.

Pip starts following Ahab around like a puppy. All navigation tools are destroyed. Starbuck repeatedly tries to get Ahab to turn back, right up until the end. We get more of Ahab's history, including more info on his wife and child.

And we finally meet Moby Dick in the flesh in Chapter 133, as brilliant and aggressive as we've heard. After 3 days of chasing, Ahab kills him but gets entangled in his line and brought down with the whale while the Pequod sinks from the ramming damage, killing everyone but Ishmael.

Rather quickly, Ishmael recounts he was almost sucked into the whirlpool created by the sunk Pequod, but he grabbed the coffin life buoy and was saved by The Rachel, still looking for its lost crew.

*Some ideas for discussion (suggestions only, post about whatever you want and feel free to post your own prompts):*

I found that structure reflected the feel of a long voyage: lots of business at the beginning and end with time for deep thought punctuated by episodic activity in the middle. Was the return to mostly plot heavy writing welcome for you? Or did you miss the digressions?

Most of the gams seem to serve a particular narrative or insightful purpose, but I'm not quite sure what the point of The Bachelor was. Just to illustrate what could have been for The Pequod under sane management? Anyone have any other ideas?

Although this echoed the early chapters of the novel (there's even another quick series of chapters indicating the passage of time during a night watch), Ahab is the star here (at least until we get to the whale), not Ishmael. There's tons of philosophizing, conversations, and soliloquies where his language really shines. Were there any favorite moments for you?

Speaking of those time shift chapters, any thoughts on the Tashtego chapter?

And if Queequeg was the memorable supporting cast from the opening, here it must be the mates. In the first chapter of the week, The Gilder, we see their and Ahab's different reactions to tranquil waters, and throughout we see Starbuck's wearied concern and Stubb's boorishness. Any particular moments stand out to you?

There are a lot of ominous warnings leading up to the Moby Dick encounter: the destroyed navigation instruments, the increasingly bleak gams, the crying seals, the coffin being transformed into a buoy, Stubb remarking it's as if they'll never drop anchors again, etc. Any particular moment you found chilling?

What was up with Fedallah? In a previous discussion, Dengru remarked about his relationship with Ahab possibly mirroring the homoeroticism of Ishmael and Queequeg and we see this a bit again here with Ahab dropping his harpoon in shock upon seeing the torn up body of his (ship)mate lashed to the whale.  However, he remains so enigmatic to the reader, never humanized like Queequeg, despite his presence seeming to loom very large in Ahab's life. And there are also more linking him to shadows. What did you make of this?

In previous discussions, we talked a bit about the importance of the water and air elements, and we have more of that here, especially in The Symphony chapter where air is characterized as feminine and water as masculine. Any thoughts on this?

Did you find that the action of the final chapters lived up to the hundreds of pages of build up? The book ends abruptly - did this disappoint you or did you find it suitable for a book with so many quiet moments to go out with a bang?

The brief epilogue had an almost ""and then everybody clapped"" outlandishness to it - as with the ""Call me Ishmael"" opening line, do  you think this called the reliability of Ishmael into question?

As usual: the weekly question of any quotes, passages, or moments that resonated with you? Please share them, it's fun seeing if we all marked the same sentences.

Started my own [Moby Dick Read-Along playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71tOzsHVTcU4Z5ESpcP8JW?si=935171d86a084e3e&pt=9f11cbd47aa104c307539ee52f9207ad) intended to be played in the background while reading. Nothing new this week.

Dumb question: did Starbuck drink coffee even once? If so, I missed it. I must have made it up in my head that the chain was named after him because he liked coffee in the book, but I always thought that was the reason.

**🌟🌟🌟 And since this is the final discussion post, most importantly:**   Did you like the book? If this was a reread, did you glean anything different this time around. If this was your first read, do you see yourself developing a  lifelong relationship with it or was it a one-and-done deal for you?

# Resources

I think one of the most touching things about this novel is the cult that surrounds it and how it seems to attract a particular type of obsessive, analytical person who likes to record, catalog, and think deeply so there's a lot of post-reading material out there for those who want more.

Here are a few I intend to check out in the coming weeks/months:

1kvlfdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1kvlfdj/you_left_me_in_labor_now_die_in_war_novel_my/,"""You Left Me in Labor… Now Die in War Novel""- My husband, Eric, was on a business trip abroad when he got caught in a terrorist attack.","Chapter 1  
  
My husband, Eric, was on a business trip abroad when he got caught in a terrorist attack.  
  
Everyone started calling me.  
  
The embassy reached out, asking me to come in for discussions.  
  
Even Eric’s family and colleagues bombarded me with calls, inquiring about the situation—some even offered to help bring him back, free of charge.  
  
I had just come out of the delivery room, yet I calmly hung up on call after call.  
  
After all, when Eric saw the news of his ex-girlfriend, Aria, a war correspondent, caught in the crossfire of a terror attack, he left me—his pregnant wife—to fly over and make sure she was safe.  
  
Back then, I was leaking amniotic fluid, clutching my swollen belly, and I asked him:  
  
“Are you really going to abandon your wife and unborn daughter to go into a war zone? Eric, if you go, I will not be responsible for the consequences.”  
  
Eric had taken all our bank books and passports and shouted at me, “You and the baby aren’t going to die anytime soon—she, on the other hand, could be dead the next second!”  
  
“You’re just giving birth. Haven’t you always been strong?” With that, he slammed the door and left.  
  
So, if he’s the one throwing his life away, why should I save him?  
  
——————  
  
Eric loved watching international news. I never understood why—until two days ago when a news report aired.  
  
A female war correspondent had been captured by terrorists during an interview.  
  
The footage lasted only a second, but I recognized her immediately—Aria, the most famous anchor on the international channel.  
  
At that moment, I was nine months pregnant, about to go into labor. Sitting in a rocking chair in the living room, I rested my hand on my belly and felt a pang of sympathy for the journalist.  
  
The next second, Eric knocked over the fruit bowl in a panic.  
  
He stood up so quickly that his knee slammed into the corner of the coffee table.  
  
The impact looked so painful that even I winced, but Eric didn’t seem to feel a thing.  
  
He staggered into the kitchen for a glass of water but accidentally hit the hot water button, scalding himself so badly he dropped the glass, shattering it.  
  
Ignoring his reddened, burned skin, he rushed into the bedroom and slammed the door shut behind him.  
  
An hour later, Eric finally emerged.  
  
“I… I have to go on a business trip.”  
  
I slowly stood up, hand still resting on my belly.  
  
“Eric, my due date is in the next couple of days. I could go into labor at any time. It’s not a good time for a trip. What if the contractions start suddenly?”  
  
“You know my mother died in childbirth with my younger brother. I’m genuinely terrified of giving birth.”  
  
“Didn’t you say the thing you were most looking forward to was being the first person our daughter saw when she opened her eyes?”  
  
Eric’s face paled, but after a moment, he said, “This trip is really important to me—I have to go. But don’t worry, I’ll definitely be back before you give birth.”  
  
I gave him a broken smile.  
  
Even though the pain in my belly was already sharp and spasmodic, and fluid was trickling down my legs like a faucet had been turned on.  
  
“I’ll agree. But Eric, I want you to know—whatever consequences come from this trip, you’ll face them alone. I won’t bear any of it for you.”  
  
Maybe my expression was too solemn, because Eric’s body trembled slightly.  
  
Then, as if swearing an oath, he said, “Don’t worry, I’ll come back safely.”  
  
With that, he rushed into the room, hastily packed a few items of clothing, and shoved on his shoes, ready to leave.  
  
Just as he was about to walk out the door, I couldn’t stop myself. I softened and called out to him.  
  
“Eric, wait a second.”  
  
He turned back, visibly irritated.  
  
“Didn’t you already say I could go? Why are you calling me back now?”  
  
Clutching my hand tightly into a fist, the pain in my belly intensifying, I remained calm.  
  
“You forgot your passport.”  
  
I dragged my body, still leaking amniotic fluid, back into the bedroom.  
  
I brought him his passport, and then handed him a bank card.  
  
That card held every paycheck Eric had transferred to me over the seven years of our marriage.  
  
His hand trembled slightly as he took the passport and the card, and even his eyes began to redden.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
For a moment, I thought he might stay.  
  
But instead, he stuffed the card and passport into his bag and swore again:  
  
“I promise I’ll be back before the baby comes.”  
  
Then he slammed the door and left in a rush.  
  
I listened to the echo of the door slamming shut in our now-empty home and calmly called the maternity ward and a postnatal care center.  
  
A man who didn’t even notice my water had broken dared to swear he’d return in time for the birth.  
  
How laughable.  
  
Eric and I met through a mountaineering club.  
  
Back then, I worked at a tech company under intense pressure. I regularly worked overtime, and the only time I could breathe was on weekends when I hiked to recover some energy.  
  
He joined the club in my second year there. At first, we were just regular teammates, but we always charged ahead together, always the first to reach the summit. Over time, we grew close.  
  
He worked in investment banking.  
  
I worked in internet tech.  
  
He liked hiking, running, and working out.  
  
So did I.  
  
When we summited our hundredth mountain, he confessed his love to me.  
  
No fancy words, no over-the-top romance.  
  
Just one sentence: “Freya, let’s be together.”  
  
I agreed.  
  
Not because he was especially charming—my father was the king of romance. When he pursued my mother, he lit up half the city with fireworks and even got arrested for disturbing the peace.  
  
But that passion ultimately destroyed my mother. When she was pregnant with their second child, my father’s mistress showed up, deliberately provoking my mother who was about to go into labor—and it killed her on the operating table.  
  
So I’d long since realized: romance is cheap. Reliability is what matters.  
  
And Eric was reliable.  
  
He was never late.  
  
His gifts were always cliché, but he never forgot a single occasion.  
  
He wouldn’t pick me up when it rained, but the moment I called, he’d come without hesitation.  
  
So, after three years of dating, we got married.  
  
Married life wasn’t much different from before.  
  
We split chores equally. On holidays, we took turns choosing vacation spots—one trip to a place he liked, one to a place I liked.  
  
It was calm, orderly, and uneventful.  
  
I once believed I was made for this kind of life.  
  
Until three years ago, when one of his college friends got married, and he brought me along to the wedding.  
  
At the bachelor party, one of his very drunk friends pulled him aside and cried:  
  
“Eric, seeing you like this—with no spark in your eyes—breaks my heart.”  
  
“I’m getting married tomorrow. I’m finally stepping into happiness. But you… you’re like someone who’s locked his heart away.”  
  
“If Aria hadn’t insisted on becoming a war reporter, you wouldn’t have ended up like this.”  
  
I saw Eric glance at me, instinctively.  
  
He quickly explained, “He’s drunk. Don’t listen to him.”  
  
I just smiled and said nothing.  
  
On the way home, leaning in the passenger seat, I said calmly, “I don’t ask for much in a partner. But the one thing I need is for him to be over his ex.”  
  
He stood where the hallway light couldn’t reach, so I couldn’t see his expression.  
  
But from that night on, the name Aria vanished from our lives.  
  
Until now.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Because I hadn’t been answering calls.  
  
I had just finished nursing our daughter at the postnatal center and was about to put her to sleep when the door suddenly flew open.  
  
It was my mother-in-law, Victoria.  
  
She rushed in, her voice trembling:  
  
“Freya, why haven’t you been answering your phone? William’s at the embassy, practically losing his mind!”  
  
“Come home with me right now. Bring Eric’s passport and documents—we have to get to the embassy immediately and confirm what’s happening.”  
  
William was my father-in-law.  
  
I didn’t respond right away. I calmly said six digits: “2-1-0-6-3-0.”  
  
She froze.  
  
I carefully tucked the blanket around my daughter before slowly explaining, “That’s the code to the front door. If you need his documents, you can get them yourself.”  
  
Victoria’s hands trembled.  
  
“Freya, how can you be so cold? Eric is in a war zone—his life’s in danger.”  
  
“He sent a group message asking for help. He’s been shot in the leg and is hiding in a stranger’s home, trying to dodge gunfire!”  
  
“I know you just had surgery and need time to recover, but this is an emergency. Can’t you just come with me to the embassy, just once?”  
  
She was shaking all over, looking like she might break down at any second.  
  
I still spoke calmly. “I knew he was injured. Before he sent out that mass message, he had already sent me several desperate pleas for help. I didn’t reply.”  
  
Victoria staggered, nearly losing her balance.  
  
I looked at her, and I won’t deny I wavered a little inside.  
  
After all, for the past seven years, she had treated me well. During the years I was without a mother, she had filled that void.  
  
But all of that had already been destroyed—by Eric himself.  
  
I took a USB drive from the nightstand and handed it to her.  
  
“This is a recording of the conversation between me and Eric that night. Watch it first, then we’ll talk.”  
  
Victoria took it with trembling hands. When the video ended, she collapsed to the floor. Her lips quivered for a long time before she finally managed to speak.  
  
“Freya… you have to believe me. Nothing ever happened between Eric and Aria.”  
  
I still couldn’t harden my heart completely. Even though the pain from my C-section was still sharp, I forced myself to get out of bed and helped her up.  
  
Just like that day when Eric left—I had already gone into labor, my water had broken—but I still softened and handed him his passport and bank card.  
  
I said gently, “I know nothing physical happened between him and Aria. But the fact that he was willing to leave his wife and unborn child behind to fly into a war zone for her—that says everything about his choice.”  
  
“He was willing to let my daughter be born without her father. He was willing to let me face the surgery alone. A man like that should be held accountable for his decisions.”  
  
As I spoke, Victoria’s face grew paler and paler. In the end, she didn’t argue further.  
  
Maybe even she couldn’t find a reason to convince me.  
  
She finally gave up and stood up, her body trembling. “You… get some rest. I’ll leave now.”  
  
She walked out the door looking like she’d aged ten years in an instant, stumbling as she went.  
  
Although I truly felt sorry for her, I still called out before she could leave completely.  
  
“Victoria, let me know sometime this week when you and William can move out of that apartment.”  
  
They had been living in a property I had fully paid for, ever since I got married.  
  
Victoria turned back, exhaustion written all over her face.  
  
“Do you really have to rush this? Can’t you wait a little?”  
  
I shook my head.  
  
“Did Eric wait? When he left, he didn’t even take me—whose water had already broken—to the hospital first. He just flew out of the country.”

Not everyone has that luxury. Here are some of my thoughts on how to detox for cheap. 

1. The best medicine is time away from mold. Go to the library or coffee shops or anything outside. The fresh air is good for you, socializing is good for you, and being away from the mold is very good for you. You cannot heal if you stay in a moldy environment. And going outside is free. Sleeping is hard if your house has mold. Either use a tent or wash your laundry frequently with borax or ec3. If you go to a friends house, don’t be like me and cross contaminate their place. That just gives you two mold problems to deal with. 
2. First line treatment is to detox with toxin binders. A blend with some common ones like activated charcoal and bentonite clay costs about $50. There are some prescription ones that work better but my doctor still recommended the supplement. A mycotoxin test can tell you which binder you need to use but mine came back negative (likely false negative) so I think a general blend is good. 
3. Detoxing can also be done via sweating. Go for a run, it’s free and has many other health benefits. Saunas are another option but usually not free. Taking binders before the sauna is generally recommended. 
4. For symptom relief follow a low fodmap or low MCAS or keto diet. Basically any elimination diet that is high in meat, no gluten, no dairy, and low in processed foods and simple sugars will be a really good start. This doesn’t fix anything it just reduces symptoms. Honestly there is no more expensive alternative for this other than maybe food sensitivity testing. Make sure to give it about 2 weeks to see if it’s working. I saw improvement quickly but it wasn’t fully clear until that 2 week mark. 
5. Meditate and do yoga. Use free online videos. Laugh a lot. Later on in the detox process you will need a nervous system reset and these are good free ways to do it. Dnrs programs can cost up to $400. I assume they are more effective but meditating and telling yourself you are safe I think is the gist of the program anyway. 
6. Once you’ve taken the binders for a while and avoided the mold then symptoms will hopefully be rapidly improving. Getting enough fiber, eating fermented foods, and eating a variety of veggies can help keep your gut healthy. You can take a stool test but it is expensive.

Everything above costs about $50 plus maybe a bit if you need to buy more expensive food or want to get supporting materials like  meditation app or a yoga matt. 

Some other things you might consider that cost money but not very much. 

Many will be low in things like magnesium, vitamin d, and b vitamins. Antioxidants like vitamin c and NAC are also really helpful. These can be supplemented. If I were to pick something most widely applicable I would choose magnetism and vitamin c as starting points.

Doing a nutreval test and talking to a doctor to figure out a personalized plan of what I was missing was useful but expensive. Trying everything I listed above is relatively hard to mess up from a safety point of view. And will cost less and take less time than buying the tests and waiting for the results.
