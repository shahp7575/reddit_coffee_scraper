For example: Lillehammer looks to be about 2 hours by train which is about right for my purposes. Would that train ride have good views? Is Lillehammer worth a visit? I would probably just be wandering around for an hour or two, grabbing a coffee or lunch and heading back.

It is still active if you'd like to cast your votes there.

This is - Round 2: Scramblers / ADVs / Multi terrain bikes

City use (maximum).
Bangalore roads.
Bangalore traffic.
Recreational vehicle.
No pillion.
_Further context below;_

75 kg body weight.
36M
5'9"" height

PICK ONE.

I used to ride Pulsar 180, rode it for ≈13 years, before selling it off, 4 years ago.
Currently, I'm eyeing ditching 2 out of the 4 wheels in my car and getting a bike again for solo city usage and recreational riding.

Primary use case would be within the city, but once every three months, if the opportunity presents itself, I'd like to venture out on a bewildering highway exploration ride, in and around Bangalore.
No goals, no destination, ride solo, enjoy the scenic views, stop for food, and return.

I'm going to run a bike choice poll, once in two to three days, of different categories of bikes. I'm not hellbent on a specific kind of motorcycle, as long as it makes me feel happy.
Personally, from experience, I have always preferred a slightly aggressive stance, like a roadster, but I realize I'm getting old for it (not really), but I think I can explore / learn to enjoy the experiences of other form factors as well.

Additional context is that, my job is WFH, so my daily commutes within the city are not work related journeys. It's just running basic errands or going across the city to grab a cup of coffee and unwind. Or simply unwinding through the busyness and noises of the streets. (Sometimes I get lonely alone at home working all day, okay, don't judge.)
And the misses, well she don't do bikes. The car will be there for when we need to travel as a unit.

[This was Round 1: Cruisers](https://www.reddit.com/r/indianbikes/s/c0mVPUY6MB)

This is Round 2: Scramblers / ADVs / Go almost anywhere bikes.

The Rounds 3 will be Roadsters / Naked sports.

Round 4 is undefined.

In absolutely no hurry to buy it, i think I'll use this to prioritize the sequence of test rides/eliminate if something glaring comes out in the discussions:

It is not the end of the world, by all logics, it might seem like it is. Trust me, it's not. There is something in store for all of you. 
It's not over until it's over. Koi exam mai puchhega nahi mock score kya thha, kitne revision kare. You just have to finally choose the right option. 
Comparison is the thief of joy. Do not talk to people who you think, are ahead of you, esp today. Protect your mental peace. 
Don't take BT thinking about your parents. You are good kids thinking it is your responsibility to make them proud. Life is more than that though. There will be many more opportunities to make them proud later. 
'Kaash aur padh leta', everyone thinks that. What matters is not giving up. 
Show up, put your best foot forward and calmly attempt the exam.
Don't drink too much coffee.

1qhx96s,https://i.redd.it/xl5ywgcwaheg1.jpeg,Animated Infographics vs. Live-Action Commercials: The Ultimate battlefield,"So here’s the thing… marketing teams are always fighting. Not like fist-fights, more like “my video style converts better than yours” fights. And the two contenders? Animated infographics and live-action commercials. Buckle up, because this is where spreadsheets meet slapstick comedy.

\---

The Cast of Characters

Animated Infographics: The quiet nerd in the corner, armed with charts, graphs, and transitions smoother than your uncle’s jazz hands at a wedding.

Live-Action Commercials: The Hollywood drama queen who insists on real actors, expensive locations, and at least three “emotional” shots of someone drinking coffee while staring into the distance.

Who Wins the Scroll-Stopping Battle?

Animated infographics = speed + clarity. One second you’re like “huh?” and the next you’re like “oh wow, I understand crypto now.”

Live-action = emotional punch. People feel things. Tears, laughter… sometimes confusion about the script, but mostly feelings.

Honestly, it’s like comparing a Swiss Army knife to a Broadway musical. Both have their charms, but one is practical, the other makes you cry over sliced bread.

Quick Comparison (Text Table Version)

Average Cost:

Animated Infographics → Low-Medium

Live-Action Commercials → High

Production Time:

Animated Infographics → 1–3 weeks

Live-Action Commercials → 4–8 weeks

Engagement:

Animated Infographics → High for social

Live-Action Commercials → High for emotional campaigns

Replay Value:

Animated Infographics → Great

Live-Action Commercials → Depends on actors’ charm

Risk of Actor Forgetting Lines:

Animated Infographics → 0%

Live-Action Commercials → 100% (probably)

The Verdict

Want clarity and speed? Animated infographics.

Want emotions and drama? Live-action.

Want both? Hire a unicorn. Or just make two videos.

I feel like my coffee is thin and there’s too much of it compare to an espresso I get at a cafè.

The puck is also wet after.

Same with meals even if the bill is split I skip alcohol and choose a cheaper dish. The company & conversation matters more than food to me. Tiny savings but they add up.

Public transport and walking whenever possible. Mumbai transport is brutal but timing it right makes it doable, at least one way.

No food delivery, like at all. LDR date nights mean my partner Instamarts me groceries instead lol.

Switched from monthly waxing to laser hair removal. Higher upfront cost but cheaper long term. Now I just shave. Haven’t spent a penny on hair removal in 1.5 years. 2 haircuts a year, no more, no less. Stopped getting my nails done at all because I hate the feeling of roughness once you remove them. I stick to natural nails most of the time, max will apply polish. Pedicures are DIY’ed.

Very basic (pharma-centric) skincare and capsule makeup collection. I only buy replacements when something finishes.

Discount and cashback maxxing. Amazon plus ICICI card usually beats local store prices.

No overbuying. I did this last year - buying more of a certain item just because of a discount, but I ended up struggling to use them up before expiry. Now I usually buy just how much i need.

I read books for free on my kindle that I was gifted. Just email a pdf to your kindle email and it comes into your library.

Places where I spend without thinking:

Family (especially birthdays, and treating them, paying for bills, groceries, other expenses here and there)

Work (just bought a MacBook, regularly attend events for networking)

I had a crush on one of my neighbors for over eight months. He also had a big crush on me. However, he thought I was married and didn’t make a move until I introduced myself and told him that I am poly, married, and open to dating others.

We went on our first coffee date, and it went really well. We were both very interested in each other’s lives. We stayed in contact until I asked him out for a second date. After that, he kept saying he was busy for two weeks. I took that as a no, so I stepped back.

He later sent me a New Year message, so I finally confessed over text that I liked him. He said he liked me too. At the same time, he told me he was afraid of getting hurt because I am poly. He said he was not familiar with poly relationships and asked for some time to think. I told him to take his time.

I didn’t chase him for three weeks. During that time, he mostly ignored me, but we still said “hi” and “how are you” when we saw each other as neighbors.

Today, I saw him moving out. He didn’t even send a goodbye message. I couldn’t help myself and asked if he was moving out today. He had mentioned before that he would move out this month, so I already knew. 

When he said yes, my heart broke. All I could say was, “Good luck and take care.”

Today was a day off from work. I woke up, showered, did my morning routine. But I had such a strong urge to go out and buy something. I WANTED to drive around and do chores. But all of that costs money. Grocery store, cleaners, I wanted to get some nail polish, buy a coffee….

And I was like “well I’ll feel bad if I sit home all day and accomplish nothing. I want to go be productive.” 

I sat with that for a little bit. Why would going out to do chores make me feel accomplished? I think because I always went with my parents growing up. And it became (in my head) the ultimate sign of being an adult and being responsible. (Even when my mom was just taking me to Marshall’s or home goods, I felt this way.)

I ended up just walking my dog around the neighborhood for the whole afternoon. It got my itch of needing to leave the house and get something done out. And I couldn’t go in any stores because I had the dog. I did get the coffee though. Which I feel like, is okay. 

Anyone else feel this way? Or any thoughts?",1,1768902993.0,shoppingaddiction,1,1.0,False

Curious to hear from the community when it comes to drinking filter coffee (not brewing), what’s your personal favourite cup? 

There are so many options now: different materials, shapes, rim thicknesses, mouthpieces that supposedly change flavour perception, etc.  
Some people swear by thin porcelain, some by glass, some by very specific designs.

If you had to recommend **one cup you’d grab without thinking twice**, what would it be?

For context:  
I recently picked up an xBloom. Before that I was brewing with a Deep 27 + ZP6.  
Now it’s basically xBloom + ZP6 Special for all my cups, and honestly the brews have been perfection.

I live in Muswell Hill and work in White City. Last week I was so drained that the thought of squeezing onto trains just felt impossible so I told myself I’d drive in and give myself a break and have my morning coffee listening to BBC Radio. I genuinely thought it would be easier on my head.

It wasn’t.

On the way in I went through Kentish Town, Camden, Regent’s Park and the Westway. On the way back I tried to be clever and go via Paddington, Hampstead and Highgate. Didn’t matter. Both directions were soul destroying. Everywhere I turned there were cones, closed lanes temporary lights, diversions that made no sense. It should have been an easy drive but it turned into more than an hour and a half of despair.   
By the time I got home I wasn’t just tired, I was angry too. It genuinely felt like London was working against me. I don’t mind roadworks existing, but having half the city dug up at the same time just feels brutal.

She'd accumulated them over decades from travel and antique shops and gift exchanges. Recently started ordering reproduction vintage styles from sellers on Alibaba specializing in traditional teaware from various regions. The collection has grown beyond cabinet space into boxes stored in closets throughout her house.

We collect objects representing lifestyles we imagine but don't actually live in our day to day existence. Her tea cups suggest refined tea ceremonies and leisurely afternoons that don't match her actual rushed coffee drinking routine before work. Maybe the cups represent aspiration, holding space for person she'd like to be even if circumstances don't allow it currently.

One thing I’ve noticed is that there’s a clear difference between fresh cream and most long-shelf packaged creams available in stores.

From my experience, fresh cream :

* Has a more natural thickness and texture
* Blends better in gravies and desserts
* Gives food a richer, more authentic taste
* Doesn’t feel overly heavy after eating

Packaged cream, on the other hand:

* Is very uniform in texture
* Sometimes splits while cooking
* Tastes slightly flat or processed in comparison

I especially noticed the difference while making:

* Creamy gravies
* Homemade desserts
* Coffee and milk-based recipes

Food made with fresh cream just feels more balanced and closer to traditional homemade cooking.

I’m curious to know:

* Do you prefer fresh cream or packaged cream?
* Have you noticed any taste or digestion differences?
* Is convenience more important, or quality?

1qhwy1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1qhwy1i/got_my_endoscopy_i_was_only_a_little_crazy/,Got my endoscopy... I was only a little crazy,"For context, I'm 28m and was diagnosed with GERD 3 years ago. Got an endoscopy in while hospitalized in 2021 that showed ulcers from heavy drinking and chronic self-induced vomiting. I quit drinking a few months later but the GERD symptoms didn't start until almost a year after that. Went thru the classic ""went to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack"" rite of passage and got diagnosed with GERD. 

For years I tried my best to manage my diet and lifestyle, and would only have occasional flare ups where that chest pain was my only symptom (I've had my heart checked several times, including some cardiac specialist testing when I was at my worst with drinking, only thing that ever comes up is moderately high blood pressure). However, I suffer badly from anxiety, with health anxiety being the worst culprit. Over the past year, my flare ups have gotten more frequent and my list of symptoms has grown to include horrible indigestion, throat tightness, and voice hoarseness. I got on PPI's but never saw the results I wanted. I quit smoking cigarettes back in October and saw no noticeable difference whatsoever. Stopped eating most foods I enjoy and eventually began to dread eating altogether.

Finally, I saved up the money for an endoscopy. At this point I was expecting cancer or at the very least a hernia or some bad scar tissue. Results came back as mild Esophagitis. No hernia. No ulcers. No narrowing of any kind. The relief I felt was indescribable.

A day after I got my results went on vacation and decided fuck it, for a week I'm gonna go wild and see how much of this has really been in my head. Black coffee, spicy food, cigarettes, citrus, chocolate, tomatoes, all the things I had convinced myself I'd never be able to have again. What I found was that some of my triggers are definitely still triggers, but after a week of smoking and eating whatever I wanted, my throat tightness was gone and my indigestion was drastically reduced. No chest pain to be felt. I've been cleaning my diet back up, but God DAMN it feels good to know that if I decide to get a spicy meal every now and then it won't be the end of the world.

So while I feel validated knowing that there is *some* tangible damage to my esophagus that can explain some of the things I've been dealing with, I know now that your own mind truly is your worst enemy when it comes to dealing with this condition.",3,1768902607.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

1qhwwev,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qhwwev/i_have_to_change_my_life/,I have to change my life,"I am in a bad place right now. I need to change. So, I have decided to be in the ""locked in"" mode. To be fully focused to turn around my life. I want to be a better partner, to be a better professional and overall to be a better human being.

I think my alcohol abuse is a symptom and a cause. It's the symptom of the fact that I'm lost in life although I have a girlfriend and a job, a symptom of my constant unsatisfaction with my life and my own personality. It's also the cause for feeling lost and unsatisfied. 

So, I've decided to stop that nonsense. And I will do it this way:

\- **Alcohol**: As the rule says, one day at a time. I'm not drinking with you today. It will be the foundation of my change and my growth.

\- **Sport**: I will go to the gym, twice a week first and then I'll increase it depending on my working and personal schedules. 

\- **Health**: I will eat healthy, everyday and I will focus on losing some weight. I will also sleep from 11 pm to 7 am everyday, even during the weekends. I will also quit vaping.

\- **Work**: I'll go to the office every day of the week, except on Monday. Of course, if it's needed for some reason or if I feel really tired, I will give myself the opportunity to stay at home another day of the week once every two weeks. I will also put more effort and thoroughness in my work, try to stick out with professionalism - while keeping balance with my private life; I can work more but not to an unhealthy extent. 

\- **Work** (2): I will try to find satisfaction with my current job, try to find a liking in what I do; I will always look at the bright side of things (also applies to my personal life).

\- **Career**: I will work everyday on competitive exams to enter a public institution, as it has been my goal. I will also try to think about how I can evolve my career to improve my revenues and my satisfaction at work.

\- **Relationship**: I will be a better partner with my girlfriend, be more present, nicer and more patient. With other people, I will be welcoming, smiling and genuinely interested in them.

\- **Finance**: I will invest more money and cut down my expenses (quitting alcohol and vaping will definitely help).

\- **Hobbies**: I will spend less time on screens and I will read more. I will also keep cooking good meals, especially during the weekend. I will try to find other hobbies. Another hobby I will need to take up is learning new leanguages - it will also be useful for my job. 

\- **Two little rules for myself**: Once every two weeks, I give myself a little gift, or a little treat. I can be something free or it can just be a nice sophisticated coffee or something a bit more expensive like some clothing. Second rule is: once a month, on a Saturday or a Sunday, I do absolutely what I want to do. If I want to go to a museum and be the whole day outside, I do that; if I want to stay at home playing video games, I do that. The only caveat is that I won't engage in a self-destructive behaviour (alcohol mainly, in my case).

  
I am writing this here for accountability and to come back to this post once in a while once I'm feeling a bit lost, because I know there will be ups and downs. I will also develop more these ""steps"" (e.g. how much money should I invest; what fitness programme I will follow, etc.) but I'll probably do that on a notebook or on my computer.",3,1768902448.0,stopdrinking,6,1.0,False

1qhwvn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qhwvn4/hr_friends_first_chapter_the_house/,[HR] <Friends> - First Chapter: The House,"I opened my eyes to complete darkness and the feeling of a snuggly feather duvet. I took a deep breath in and enjoyed the woody scent of my night shelter to a melody of absolute silence. What time was it? My arm reached for my smartphone on the side table. A white six thirty-two flashed above my usual mountain range wallpaper.

Two years ago, I relocated to Zurich after accepting a senior position from a big financial group, expecting a tamer workload than in London. Unfortunately, the hours were still long and strenuous, and my colleagues— But the pay was fantastic and the country beautiful. From the city centre, on a clear day, you could see the Alps, a wall of majestic mountains teasing from beneath the sky.  
Earlier this month, in dire need of a green break, I booked a one-night shelter in the middle of a two-day hike, two hours southeast of Zurich.

Yesterday, after a five-hour trek alternating between pine forests and breathtaking cliffs, waterfalls, and distant glaciers, I reached the shelter. It was incredible.  
I expected the usual bring-your-own-sleeping-bag, cramped dorm with a fireplace, outside latrines, and maybe a tiny gas kitchen, but this was a five-star Airbnb in the wild. The house was a scarlet-painted, one-bedroom, wooden cottage. The inside was similar to a modern, fully furnished apartment. There was a big and cozy livingroom, its walls painted with the same scarlet, adorned with photographs of local mountain ranges. Against the entrance wall was a three-people woolen beige couch facing an ashen coffee table next to a wooden armchair. The kitchen had a gas stove and oven, and a fridge full of fresh meat and vegetables. The immaculate bathroom was equipped with an automated Japanese toilet and an Italian shower with hot water on tap.  
At first, I believed I must have entered the wrong house. Especially, there was only one large king-size bed in the bedroom. But a leaflet at the entrance presented the house as the shelter I had booked, with explanations on how to use the appliances. I knew Switzerland was wealthy, but that was way beyond my wildest trekking dreams.

And now, after the best sleep of my life, my heart ached to leave this heavenly home. I still had a six-hour scenic trek to complete, followed by a two-hour drive back.  
I flipped on the small lamp on the side table. It projected a dimmed amber light on the ceiling and walls. Reluctantly, I slipped out of the snuggly comforter and opened the curtains to… pitch-black darkness. I could only stare at the reflection of my thirty-five-year old face, with his scruffy liquorice hair and not-shaved-yet twenty-four-hour beard.  
It was the middle of July. The sun should have risen before six. I glanced at my phone again: six thirty-six. And, wasn’t there a pine tree just outside?

Still in my underwears I opened the entrance door, expecting to be graced by the crispy mountain air, but the temperature was as balmy as inside. A long juniper light pole clicked and lit up by itself, beaming an eerie white light on a small white metallic garden table with a single white chair, both adorned with pink flower motifs. The table and chair waited on green trimmed grass, two metres in front of the entrance. The grass extended for around three more metres and ended.  
Yes, ended.  
I staggered outside, passed the table, and reached the “edge of grass” to find… nothing. Only pitch black darkness above, below, left and right. I was on a small island, floating in an ocean of void.

The first days were unnerving. I thought I was dreaming. But when I kept waking up, day after day, in the same place, I became enraged. I cursed this island of solitude and whoever trapped me here. I stabbed, sliced, tore, and shredded the furniture, shattered all the tableware, and threw the small table and chair into the abyss, only to find everything back and mended on the next day. I begged whoever was listening to reveal what it wanted from me. I wanted to scream at the abyss, but refrained, afraid of what would answer. Then, desperate, I contemplated jumping from the edge.

Every day, the fridge opened, refilled. Water, hot or cold, never ran out. No matter how long I let it run. Even the coffee machine had a bottomless stock of coffee beans.  
A small walnut-coloured vintage Victor radio was sitting on a shelf in the livingroom. When on, it was somehow capturing several stations, constantly playing classic, rock, metal, and other genres of music with an impeccable sound quality. On the bookshelf rested a collection of award-winning books, including The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, illustrated by J. R. R. himself.

One day, after my depressed episode, I decided to exploit the little control I still had, starting with an improvised twenty-minute workout session with bodyweight squats, push-ups, and crunches. In the bathroom, I found a trimmer and used it on my overgrown beard and hair. Smiling back in the mirror, I finally recognised myself – a far cry from my old athletic self, but still myself.  
The little workout made me feel so energised that I wished my gaoler had built a little home gym. I missed a real squat rack, bench, and pull-up bar, and... nevermind.  
The next morning, I was enjoying a nutty and creamy coffee, sitting in the front yard with the old abyss, when I noticed the house had a new extension. Connected on its left was what looked like a parking box.  
The heavy parking door tilted open. Inside was a concrete three-by-three metres room equipped with a squat rack, a bench, and a pull-up bar.

I think one of the worst offenders is when this girl and I kept texting back and forth, eventually I asked if she'd like to get coffee over the weekend, but she said she couldn't because she goes home on the weekends (I live on campus and she lives close enough to commute) so after not being able to find a time we fell out of contact. Some months later she texts me asking if I was at some event, so then we get to texting again and a I offer her my phone number (because before we were texting on Instagram) anyway she says she'll text me, a day or so goes by and I never get a text, I then realize I sent her a wrong number by accident and then had to correct myself. I messed up my own phone number and didn't notice for like a day and a half. Honestly I should have just given up there, but eventually we set a time, got ice cream and talked for like an hour. She was nice, it was a normal conversation. But nothing ever happens after. Idk man, I left out some details but looking back at that whole endeavor makes me cringe so hard. There were so many signs to just give up and I kept trying and making things worse. Idk nothing happened so nobody got offended or creeped out or hurt or whatever, but I just wish I gave up and saved myself the cringe I feel every time these thoughts randomly pop up.

Maybe it's all a sign. Because every time I try and ask oth a girl, I do the cringiest thing imaginable one way or another. Idk maybe it's a sign to just give up. It's been about a year since that story above happens and I haven't asked out a girl since.

Despite paying 10x, as much as a major service, still came back mechanically off-tune and post-rain rusty brake discs because that's a ""warranty issue"". But if you're restoring a classic, refurbing a used, or doing this as part of a wider modding project, maybe makes sense.

It included interior deep upholstery cleaning, waxing interior surfaces, and body polishing. Got it next day feeling super clean, but smelling toxic and rode back with wet butt. Body paint still warped from the sun and they didn't touch the dusty hood or under the boot trunk cover, missed a crayon lodged under the rear seatbelt. Customer experience was superb... branded paper mats on the floors, great waiting room coffee, gave me maintenance tips, they followed and gave me a multi-point checklist. Renegotiated after dissatisfied and got a discount but one shouldn't have to.
* **Garage Z - Mine (1 week ago): Nice guys, super price (300-400), so good it's bad!** Was too good. Took 3 days. They did an AMAZING job returning the car to normality after being a 4-year-old's art canvas and parkgoer's footrest. Although no under-chassis, they didn't miss any important spot, warned about broken parts like reverse camera, and they degreased the hood. Zero smell, dry seats. Unfortunately, the cleaning damaged the car, and having been given no invoice, you don't have many rights. So beware.

I'm still going around in circles about what to do now after this last one. Problem is, this 2017 Sportage couldn't handle it... every 5 SECONDS now it makes two annoying clicks inside. Took it to them, they couldn't figure it out, so I took to my mechanic who told me that moisture from chemical steam is likely interfering with electric boxes under the steering column, possibly the security system. They did touch the steering wheel for sure because when it came back, the adjustment handle was unlevered. I had him talk to them in Urdu and the consensus was to leave it in the sun with windows open and heater on for a few days, and it will go away. 48 hours later, still there.

A friend of mine called ChatGPT agreed that it's a common problem in Kias/Hyundais/etc, probably moisture or detergent causing voltage instability/extended relay chatter, resulting in contact resets with a relay connector, battery/ground, BCM-triggered accessory, steering-lock logic, or HVAC actuator. Now, as a non-mechanic, I probably have to take it back to dealer for a costly diagnosis & replacement. Hard to prove that it was the detailer's fault, vs coincidental wear-and-tear given the age of the car. Not exactly what I paid for or have the time to deal with, just to get my car cleaned. So I guess I'll just sip on the karak.

1qhwsh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/reviewmystores/comments/1qhwsh2/httpgrooviegoodscom_review/,http://GroovieGoods.com review,"## **First Impressions - The Good**

The site loads fast, which is a huge win. Clean, minimalist design that doesn’t get in the way. The photography is gorgeous - that warm, natural light on the ceramics gives off serious artisan vibes. You’ve nailed the aesthetic for what looks like handcrafted coffee gear.

The hero image with “DESIGN MEETS RITUAL” is solid branding. It tells me immediately this isn’t just selling stuff - you’re selling a lifestyle, a morning coffee experience. That’s smart positioning.

## **Now, The Problems…**

**1. Content is WAY too thin**

you’ve got like 4 products showing on your homepage. Four! When I land on an ecommerce site, I want to see what you’ve got. Right now it feels more like a portfolio site than a store. I have no idea if you have 5 products total or 50.

The “VIEW ALL” button helps, but you’re asking me to click before I even know what’s here. Show me more products upfront - at least 8-12 on the homepage.

**2. Product descriptions are missing**

I see prices ($15-$60 range), but zero product info on the homepage. What makes that Jade Moka special? Is it handmade? What’s the material? Capacity? Why should I pay $45 for a moka pot when I can get one at Target for $20?

The “Oatmeal Espresso Cups” are sold out - which is actually good social proof! But I still don’t know anything about them.

**3. No storytelling or brand identity**

“WELCOME TO GROOVIE GOODS - DESIGN MEETS RITUAL” is all I get. Who are you? Why do you exist? Are these your designs? Where are they made? What’s the story?

Coffee people are obsessed with origin stories and craftsmanship. You’re missing a huge opportunity to connect emotionally. Even just 2-3 paragraphs about your mission would help.

**4. Navigation is confusing**

You have “Goods” in your menu, which presumably shows all products. But on mobile, what’s the difference between that and “Shop All”? Also, only 4 menu items total feels empty. Consider adding:

- “Our Story” or “About” in the nav
- Maybe “Collections” if you plan to group products
- “Care Instructions” or “FAQ”

**5. Trust signals are basically non-existent**

I see payment icons in the footer (good), but:

- No customer reviews visible
- No testimonials
- No “As Featured In” if you’ve gotten press
- No Instagram feed showing your products in use
- Nothing about your return policy upfront
- No info about shipping times

When you’re asking someone to drop $45-60 on coffee gear from a site they’ve never heard of, you need to build trust FAST.

**6. The free shipping threshold is hidden**

“Free Shipping on Orders $45+ (US Only)” is in that scrolling banner at the top, but it goes by so fast. Put this prominently on product pages and in your cart. This is a conversion driver - use it!

**7. Instagram link is there but…**

You’ve got a link to Instagram (@grooviegoods) which is great, but embed some of that content on your homepage! Show me real people using your products. User-generated content sells better than product shots alone.

**8. No email capture**

I don’t see any popup or section asking for my email. Even if I’m not ready to buy today, you want to capture me so you can bring me back. Offer 10% off first order or early access to new products.

**9. Pricing concerns**

$15 for espresso cups, $45 for a moka pot, $60 for the set… these aren’t impulse buys for most people. You need to justify the value. What makes these special? Are they:

- Handmade by artisans?
- Made from special materials?
- Limited edition?
- Better quality than mass-market stuff?

Tell me why I should care!

**10. Mobile experience**

The site works on mobile, but that horizontal product scroll is awkward. Most people expect to scroll down, not sideways. Consider a grid layout instead.

## **What’s Working**

- **Speed**: Site loads super fast - keep that up
- **Photography**: Really professional, consistent style
- **Brand name**: “Groovie Goods” is memorable and fun
- **Color palette**: Warm, inviting tones match the product vibe
- **Sold out items**: Shows demand (just don’t leave them sold out too long)

## **Quick Wins - Do These This Week**

1. **Add product details** to every item - materials, dimensions, care instructions
1. **Write an About Us page** - who you are, why you make these, your values
1. **Add 10-15 customer reviews** (hopefully you have some customers already?)
1. **Create an Instagram feed widget** on your homepage showing your products in action
1. **Add an email signup** with a 10% discount incentive
1. **Beef up your FAQ page** - returns, shipping times, care instructions
1. **Show more products** on the homepage (8-12 minimum)

## **Medium-term Fixes**

1. **Start a blog** about coffee rituals, care tips, maybe recipes
1. **Create bundles** - “Complete Coffee Ritual Set” at a slight discount
1. **Add live chat** or at least a prominent “Questions? Email us”
1. **Build out your story** - photos of your workshop, process, team
1. **Create size/buying guides** - “Which moka pot is right for you?”
1. **Add a “Shop Instagram”** feature so people can click on your photos to buy

## **The Bottom Line**

You’ve got a beautiful foundation, but it feels like a soft launch that’s not quite ready for prime time. It’s too minimal - not in a zen way, but in a “there’s not enough here to make me confident buying” way.

Your target customer (coffee snobs, design nerds, ritual-makers) wants to know the story behind their stuff. They want to feel like they’re part of something. Right now, you’re just showing pretty pictures with prices.

Give me reasons to care. Give me reasons to trust you. Give me reasons to tell my friends about you.

**Current state: 5/10** - Looks nice, but not conversion-ready

**Potential: 8/10** - You’ve clearly got taste and good products

Fix the content and trust issues, and you’ll be in much better shape. Happy to dig deeper into any of these areas if you want specifics!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1768902051.0,reviewmystores,0,1.0,False
1qhwrse,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepSolid/comments/1qhwrse/vpn_encryption_isnt_magic_heres_how_it_actually/,VPN encryption isn’t magic – here’s how it actually keeps creeps out of your data,"Hey [r/KeepSolid](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepSolid/),

Around 40–45% of US adults say they use a VPN mainly for privacy and to hide their online activity, but very few could explain what “VPN encryption” really does under the hood. At the same time, reports show that modern VPNs rely on strong encryption standards like AES‑256 and secure tunneling, which are also used by governments and banks to protect sensitive data. Understanding this at a basic level helps you know when a VPN meaningfully improves your online safety – and when you’re still exposed.​

* **What “encryption” actually means** Encryption is just turning readable data (your messages, logins, browsing) into scrambled text that looks like nonsense to anyone who intercepts it. With a VPN, this scrambling happens *before* your traffic leaves your device, so even your ISP or that sketchy airport Wi‑Fi “boss level” network only sees encrypted blobs, not what you’re doing.​
* **The VPN tunnel in plain English** A VPN builds an encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server, so your traffic travels inside a protected “tube” through the internet. Even if someone sits on the same public Wi‑Fi and sniffs packets, what they capture is encrypted and practically useless without the decryption key.​
* **Why AES‑256 keeps popping up** Many modern VPNs use AES‑256, a symmetric cipher widely described as the gold standard for protecting sensitive data. Brute‑forcing a 256‑bit key with today’s computing power would take an absurd amount of time (think longer than human history), which is why banks and governments also rely on it.​
* **Encryption doesn’t fix everything** Even with strong encryption, a VPN does not stop phishing, weak passwords, or you typing your credentials into a fake site. That’s why many organizations now combine VPNs with basics like multi‑factor authentication and better password hygiene to reduce real‑world account takeovers.​
* **A quick mental model you can use** Think of your online safety stack like this: VPN encryption protects your traffic in transit, MFA protects your accounts if a password leaks, and good browsing habits protect you from handing data to attackers yourself. When those three work together, casual snoopers and “coffee shop hackers” have a much harder time getting anything useful from you.​

The key takeaway: **VPN encryption is powerful, but it’s one layer in your privacy and cybersecurity setup, not the whole story.** Try treating VPN + strong passwords + MFA as your default online safety trio this week and notice where you’re still relying on “hope” instead of actual protection.​

Questions for you:

* When did you first realize what your VPN actually does with your traffic – was there a specific “aha” moment?
* Do you think most people around you overestimate or underestimate what a VPN can protect them from? Why?
* Which part of VPN tech should r/KeepSolid unpack next?",1,1768901983.0,KeepSolid,0,1.0,False
1qhwrmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1qhwrmt/i_need_help_with_my_fear/,I need help with my fear,"Hi, I really need some outside perspective because I feel like I’m losing my sense of reality a bit.
I recently reconnected with my ex. We’re back in contact, we text (not constantly, but regularly), he’s not dry, he initiates sometimes, he’s called me when he saw me in public, we grabbed coffee before, and he even came over to my place recently — we talked for hours and were comfortable enough to just lie on my bed and talk. From an outside perspective, it really doesn’t look like someone who has completely moved on.
He did tell me honestly that he went out with one girl once but said it went nowhere and that he likes being single right now. That part really triggered me.
The issue isn’t so much him — it’s my mind.
I’ve been stuck in this intense fear that he’s going to replace me or find someone else, even though there’s no concrete evidence of that happening right now. My brain keeps jumping to worst-case future scenarios (like imagining him having a girlfriend by summer when we’re supposed to work together), and I get physical anxiety from it — chest tightness, panic, crying.
I also got really caught up in manifestation / “law of assumption” content, which honestly made things worse. I started believing that my fears could cause reality, so every negative thought felt dangerous. I became hyper-aware of my mind, constantly checking if I’m “believing the wrong thing,” worrying I’ve already messed things up or that it’s “too late” because I’ve been afraid for so long.
What confuses me the most is that:
Reality shows signs of connection and interest
My fear says “ignore that, he’ll still find someone else”
I don’t want to believe that fear, but it keeps looping
I keep asking myself:
How do I know what I truly believe vs what I’m just afraid of?
Can fear really “create” outcomes, or am I just anxious?
Am I sabotaging something by being scared, or am I just dealing with attachment anxiety?
I feel exhausted, confused, and scared of repeating past pain. I don’t want reassurance that “everything will work out” — I just want to know if this sounds like anxiety / anxious attachment, or if I’m missing something obvious.
Has anyone experienced something similar — where things look okay on the outside, but your brain just won’t let you feel safe",1,1768901970.0,NevilleGoddard,1,1.0,False

1qhwox0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhwox0,"A bit more, and reflections","It’s been a month since my husband’s passing. I knew when I overturned the stones into Jay’s background and in South Africa, I would uncover bad acts he had committed. A person doesn’t completely obscure who they are and put on a different persona and nationality and is apprehensive about returning (being deported) to their homeland, if they weren’t hiding from their past and didn’t want their origins and family to be discovered. But I had to know, no matter what. Otherwise I would keep wondering, which would eat away at me and be worse. At first it was wild and mind-boggling, but after a point I was not shocked, only fascinated by Jay, like a bizarre specimen or alien creature. There was the Jay I knew, and there was this Jay-stranger. He has been described by others as secretive and mysterious. He told me in the beginning we would have an adventure together…he was right, just not in the way I would ever have expected.

I have always had a firm sense of right and wrong (being a victim in other respects, this was the 1st time I was romance scammed), and what Jay did was so fundamentally foul and of such magnitude for decades, that despite my love for him, I won’t protect or cover up. He needs to be accountable. Now that he is deceased, who he was and what he’s done to so many women/people, and gotten away scot-free doesn’t have to be under wraps. When he was alive and L put up that 2010 warning about him, she faced his wrath and threats and zeal in getting it removed, which he was successful, unfortunately.

For Jay’s victims, knowing he is deceased, they can at least know he cannot harm anyone ever again. The victims who are aware of his passing feel this way, as do I, despite how I miss and loved him, and still do. The mornings are the worst, when I awaken and he’s not beside me in bed or up and about with his coffee, and it hits me hard he’s no longer here and is gone for good. He was such a dominant, strong force in my life; as a friend here said, he filled the room.

I had mentioned when Jay presented himself as British/English, how his accent was convincing. It seems the Durban accent is not the “typical” South African one, it’s more akin to British, and hence why he was able to sound believably like an Englishman. And on the topic of his voice, as L had brought up, Jay had an amazing voice which he used to great effect, along with his charm and magnetism, to attract women (and men when so inclined). It was deep, smooth, seductive and magnetic. L said when she and Jay would be out, women would fawn over him; I had witnessed that myself and even Jay mentioned the effect his voice had. It was like a radio voice on steroids. Hence, one of his lies that he had been a voice over artist, was very credible.

He had numerous victims in South Africa, Namibia, the UK and the US. But there could be other places. Jay spoke of his travels, for instance, in Continental Europe, Australia, and Asia, with Ibiza and Thailand being big favorites. He could’ve been lying as he usually did, but given his propensity to get around, it is possible he also had a presence in these locales.

When it was early days in our involvement, Jay told me he had scrubbed everything about himself online, due to having crazy admirers and stalkers from his international DJ days. He was international alright…an international con man and those “crazy admirers and stalkers” were victims trying to track him down.

But back to his early life in South Africa, Jay had told me that he came from a highly abusive household, that his father (who he said was an award-winning Michelin chef) was violent and his mother was a battered wife; that his grandmother Mavis had disowned her son/his father due to that; also, that an uncle had tried to molest him as a child, his father found out and he thought his father had something to do with his uncle’s death. Those were not true, he had an ordinary enough childhood, not one full of family drama and trauma and misery as he claimed.

When we first got involved, Jay said that he had been celibate for a few years, had gotten the womanizing out of his system (told me he lost track at over 100), and had been seeking the right woman to spend the rest of his days with. And that he had never been married, as I had not. He did this habitually, to make his targets feel special and “selected”, when in reality Jay was a huge player. Not that I wanted anyone other than him as I was hooked, but I was faithful for 4 years thousands of miles away, while he was not. He not only cheated on me with this woman but also others. I know now that as soon as we settled in Arizona, he was on the hunt, as a woman here informed me after his death, that he tried it on with her.

He hid this side completely, I thought he was totally loyal and satisfied, as I was, but he got bored and restless easily and needed constant stimuli and novelty and activity, hence the con man profession and constant prowling for action. Whereas I was the complete opposite, an introverted, sedate homebody who liked familiarity and stability and security, not the chaos and agitation Jay caused and craved. I liked things simple and frugal (he did make concessions) and minimal whereas Jay’s entire existence was convoluted and extravagant and maximal. He would often say my dear wife who gives me no strife, that I was the yin to his yang. But among his many PMs to other women, he states women who are creative and adventurous, dislikes routine and are up for an adventure at a moment’s notice, are his turn on. Which is so not me. He pretended we were compatible, when in actuality he craved female versions of himself.

But I feel no sense of inadequacy; even if I had been the most exciting woman in the world, Jay still would’ve strayed and betrayed as he did with the others. He desired novelty and variety in spades. It’s as if he was possessed to live as depraved and hedonistic an existence as possible, way beyond the realm of human decency. His insatiable appetites could never be satisfied…a friend of his said, he lived by his wits and did what he had to do to live the life he wanted on his terms, consequences and people be damned. And as his school friend and later victim told me, Jay would’ve taken it all from me and felt nothing, he had zero conscience.

The pattern I noticed Jay had: he had a main target that he would be living with and supporting him, but would also sometimes have another one going at the same time or overlapping, so he could transition from one to the next without any gaps. Also, he had side pieces and hustles going on as well. While he didn’t yet have someone to fall back on here as far as I can ascertain, undoubtedly in time he would’ve found another mark. Plus, had he absconded with all my funds, that would’ve given him quite the cushion. He was constantly on the make and on the take.

Despite obtaining tons of money from his multitude of victims over the decades, Jay didn’t have any to show for it. He didn’t have any bank accounts or credit cards, and used cash or money orders or gift cards. He was a profligate spender and blew through money quickly. He didn’t want a paper trail and to be on the radar, which is probably why he was able to get away unscathed. That, as well as being a very devious person, along with a bit of luck, and knew when to vanish before the walls closed in.

What I find particularly sad is for days and weeks after his death, there were no phone calls or emails or text messages from friends (only a smattering had been informed of his passing), just some, not a lot of, perfunctory Facebook messages pertaining to his birthday. I know he did have a female accomplice he concocted schemes with in years past, whom L told me all about, but it seems for the most part he flew solo in his criminal endeavors. For such an extroverted person who knew many people, it struck me as profoundly sad. What a life, never having authentic relationships because his entire existence was made up of lies and selfishness.

Regardless of what he was and as insane as it may sound, I am especially thankful he was in my life because he got me through a really rough period when my mother passed. She had been my rock all my life, and I don’t know what I would’ve done if not for Jay and him becoming my rock, once my mother was gone. It was all for deplorable self-serving reasons as I now know, but for that and all those 8+ good years I had with him, in a way I feel he was worth every cent he cost me. He was also a domestic god and marvelous house husband, cleaning and maintaining and fixing things; his exes I know of had told me with them, he didn’t do that. And things like making vegetarian/vegan meals for me, he was an excellent cook, and drying/brushing my hair…he doted on me. He took charge of everything, although after his death I have had to learn or relearn things, having gotten rusty at it since I became very reliant on him.

And most importantly, whether he meant to or not, his giving me the legit passwords to his laptop and phone in case something were to happen to him, was an enormous  gift and an atonement, otherwise I would’ve been in a terrible way, not having access to his contacts and chats and photos/videos and the wealth of (dismaying) info provided. Of course, had Jay lived to fleece me of everything, that would be different and he wouldn’t be worth ending up destitute, heartbroken and abandoned, never knowing where he is and continuing to prey on others. Although I have been advised to change it back, I am keeping the Lumsden surname forever because as it stands, while being self-aware to acknowledge he was a diabolical predator who devastated and traumatized so many lives, mine included, on an emotional level I loved this man ferociously and will always carry a torch for him.

Posted here around a month back while going through some pretty awful withdrawals. hadn’t been through anything like that before, honestly had no clue what was going on. Glad I found this sub in the midst of my 30-hours-in-withdrawal-panic-despair mode.

I do not want to go through that again. while I knew things were bad, I did not think they were /that/ bad that I’d be having closed eye hallucinations, insomnia, tremors and twitching, hypnic jerks, brain zaps and all kind of weird sensations in the head, icepick headaches - random twinges in my head, tingling in extremities, visual flashes and disturbances at night, temperature sensitivity, lightheadedness, light sensitivity, speech slurring the first three days (?), lots of brain fog and head pressure, blanking out - amongst other things that I don’t fully remember. going to a hospital was not an option for me at the time, but of course, if you can then just do it. Oh and the biggest symptom that still persists - visual snow/hppd(?)/vision disturbances. I also experienced a bit of derealisation and was unable to even cry or ‘feel’ emotion those first few days. I can usually cry on command so that was pretty freaky. 

It feels odd because while I’d been a heavy drinker, I could stop for 2-3 days in the middle, feel shitty for a few days, and get right back to drinking. I’d only experienced close to whatever this was… maybe a few months back when I was going through an illness + cold turkey quit alcohol after a bender. Even then, it wasn’t this bad.

For some context: I’m 26f, been drinking pretty heavily since college - I’d say it began veering into serious alcohol abuse territory around 3-4 years ago. Was probably sober during covid for a bit of a stretch and then for a month and a half in 2025. Otherwise it varied between weekend drinking to 3-4 times a week maybe more (binging and blacking out about half the time), depending on what was happening in my life. I’d been drinking almost every day for a month and a half prior to quitting cold turkey this time, ranging on an average from 15-20 units of alcohol to 25+ on occasion. I’d done acid the week before I quit cold turkey as well. The day I quit, I had a strong coffee around 5 in the evening which was extremely dumb but I was so out of it and needed ‘something’ and hadn’t really expected withdrawals this severe. I think it definitely contributed to whatever the fuck ensued that first night. 

The first night, I couldn’t sleep - every time I closed my eyes I’d have these visuals flash before my eyes, very acid-psychedelic like visuals, but like, creepier. Cartoon like. Faces of people I knew but like they were made of wax, dripping, exaggerated cartoon eyes. Sexual stuff. Creatures. This kind of amoeba looking structure that had tentacles wiggling. I don’t think I’d experienced anything like this since I was a kid - like being able to literally ‘see’ stuff so clearly when I close my eyes, travel through worlds like a portal like I was going deeper and deeper - id jerk awake when it got too much for me to take. I’d see wisps and flashes of light in the dark when my eyes were open at night, very slight movements from the corner of my eyes. Terrifying stuff honestly. I posted on this sub the next day and got some advice to taper, and ended up doing that for one day… probably should have continued for 2-3 days but I was pretty out of it and just decided to raw dog it.

I ended up quitting coffee as well, which probably worsened (was a heavy caffeine drinker too) my symptoms. And I guess I’m kindled (?) cuz while my drinking was bad, it wasn’t /too/ bad (or so I thought) to have serious withdrawals. The first few days, I kept a small bottle of wine near my bedside table and carried it around with me if I had to step out. A bit comical honestly. i was just making it hour by hour, reading pretty much every single reddit thread on seizures and danger zones and withdrawal symptoms etc etc. I was trying to eat as well as I could, taking supplements and electrolytes (was taking a low dose b1, should have gotten the benfotiamine), drinking water, going for walks, etc etc. I was able to sleep a bit better the second night, having had 1/4 bottle of wine that day + melatonin. The rest of my physical symptoms continued on for another 3-4 days, and started to improve around day 4 or 5.

If you’re doing this at home, it really helps to have someone who knows what you’re going through around. I told my brother and called a friend over. It was a lot easier to ride out having someone around (was still pretty shitty don’t get me wrong but It helped having a semblance of safety). 

Occasionally I’d have these spells of wooziness and body chills and slight twitching and tingling in extremities take over me around day 2 and 3, while I was just going about my day for around 10ish mins. While they felt like anxiety symptoms it wasn’t so much anxiety as just general feeling of being ‘off’. I have no idea if these were partial seizures or just my brain chemistry going out of whack…yeah. I was doing plenty of reddit reading of course. Again, If you can go to a doctor, just go. im a bit scared to find out what this stuff was. 

It took around a week for these major physical symptoms to subside. the closed eye visuals subsided by day 3 or 4 and so did the major visual disturbances. but this sort of visual snow/hppd thing continued - like everything around me was slightly jittering or shaking or shimmering, and like the world around me felt kind of…off. Like I wasn’t seeing straight. It wasn’t so much blurriness, as a slight distorted (?) view/halos/slight afterimages when looking into lights/like my eyes had trouble settling on something still. Words were kind of jittering. Walls. Straight lines. Patterns. visual strain. Not sure if it was from alcohol or caffeine withdrawals, or hppd/llingering effects of acid - I suspect it’s the combination of all the substances and the subsequent withdrawals.  It’s gotten much better since then - still persists mildly though. I saw an eye doctor who said my eyes were fine and that i should check with a neurologist or some such. Which I plan to do soon. But I wasn’t able to find too much info linking withdrawals and vision issues - definitely not something that fits my particular case. sensitivity to sunlight as well that seems to be very very slowly improving, but is definitely an annoyance.

Around 2 weeks in was when I began to feel mildly like a person again. the brain fog began to slightly dissipate, but the mental and emotional symptoms started to get more erratic. Mood swings, irritation - a lot of irritation, random crying spells, anhedonia, lack of motivation. That stuff still pretty much persists. Annoyance, regret, guilt, shame, lots of hate directed inwards… you get the picture. Why did I get myself into this position, sobriety content fucking sucks, am I brain damaged, am I never going to amount to anything, have I ruined my future, am I never going to have fun again, have I lost my edge my creativity my ambition, I’m too young for this shit, am I broken, etc etc. yeah. That stuff comes and goes.

Mostly just trying to get into an exercise routine, eat well, slowly do whatever I can when I can. go for events (your tolerance level for drunk bs and bad music is a lot less), meet people (this is a hit and miss), read. Should probably go for therapy. Get some blood tests. See a neurologist. Pretty scared of doctors, potential major diagnosis stuff. Liver/brain/heart/etc. so I’ve been a bit slow on that front. 

The desire to drink mostly overtakes me in those ‘nothing’ moments. what a nice afternoon to get a drink. What a nice day to day drink. Wouldn’t it be nice to stay up fucking around on the internet with a bunch of beer. Wouldn’t it be fun to go on some dates get sloshed and walk around. But yeah, I will most likely crash and burn if I drink again so while I’m not thinking of forever, I’m trying to spend as long as I can sober. It feels kind of okay on some days. I guess.

I do wonder how ‘kindled’ I am though. I’m mostly terrified of dealing with withdrawals should I ever drink again. So yeah… gonna be a while I suppose. ",4,1768901445.0,dryalcoholics,0,1.0,False

**\*\*\* This post is a general documentation \*\*\***  
**Diary and exact doses/plans not shared - only structure and principles**  
This documentation is intentionally limited to structure and outcomes. No attempt is made to generalize or recommend the approach described.

**Two-Phase Fasting–Ketosis Protocol (Documented Case)**  
**PART 1 - Weight reduction phase**

Total energy intake below 500 kcal/day over 10 weeks - equivalent to less than 40% of the body's basal needs (Based on a combination of eating days of 400–700 kcal and fasting periods of 48–72 hours.)

**1.0. Context and clarification**

This document describes an extreme, medically inspired weight loss regimen designed to test the limits of physiological fat burning in a healthy adult male. The protocol combines deep ketosis, scheduled fasting intervals and extreme calorie restriction. It is carried out with occasional medical supervision and documented as an experimental case, not as a recommended method.

The regimen corresponds to what is referred to in professional circles as therapeutic ketosis with fasting or extremely calorie restrictive ketosis - methods used clinically in epilepsy, severe obesity and metabolic dysfunction. It is in practice a combination of OMAD (One Meal A Day) and 48–72 hour fasting periods in deep ketosis. In more technical language it is called a medical fasting protocol with ketogenic meals.

In this project, OMAD is implemented as one meal a day consumed in less than 30 minutes, not an open eating window. On fasting days, omega-3 and collagen are omitted to achieve complete fasting and maximum autophagy.

More brutally expressed, this is a “hard ketosis with fasting days and zero exceptions” – a pure fat burning protocol, not a lifestyle fad. In short: 100% metabolic control – no food, no compromise.

**1.1. Preparation and setup**

The aim was to investigate how far fat burning and metabolic control can be driven without medication or exercise, but within a safe physiological framework.

Starting point: 51 years / 181 cm / 92 kg.

The protocol was based on long-term experience with OMAD through shift work, and included planned fasting periods of 48–72 hours, strictly controlled electrolyte intake, and full daily micronutrient coverage.

**1.2. Permitted foods and supplements**

\- Protein sources  
Skinless chicken fillet, turkey fillet, white fish (cod, pollack, haddock, saithe), shrimp, crab, mussels, egg whites, tuna in water (limited to 3–4 cans per week).

\- Vegetables  
Non-starchy only: broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage types, Brussels sprouts, spinach, squash, cucumber, mushrooms, celery, spring onions, leeks, chilies, garlic, lettuce types, green peppers, fennel, asparagus, green beans, seaweed/algae.

\- Seasoning  
Salt, pepper, sugar-free spices, vinegar, lemon/lime, soy sauce (reduced salt), unsweetened mustard, herbs, sugar-free broth.

\- Drinks  
Water (carbonated or non-carbonated), black coffee, unsweetened herbal tea, water with salt.

\- Supplements (categories without doses)  
Multivitamin, vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, omega-3, sodium/potassium, salt.  
All supplements were taken daily, including during fasting periods (not collagen or omega-3). Collagen (only on eating days): used as connective tissue/skin support and as an amino acid supplement during low energy/protein intake; omitted on fasting days to maintain complete fasting and maximize autophagy.

**1.3. Structure and implementation**

Eating days: 400–700 kcal (total average <500 kcal/day when fasting days are included).  
Fasting days: 48–72 hours after planned rotation.  
Fluid intake: 3–5 liters per day.

Electrolyte balance was maintained through systematic supplementation of sodium and magnesium, adapted to fasting periods and fluid intake. This part of the program was considered critical for physiological tolerance and stability throughout both the weight reduction and acclimatization phases.

On fasting days, 60–90 minutes of brisk walking was normally performed to stimulate circulation and fat mobilization, without intensity that could affect recovery or hormonal balance. No structured strength or interval training was performed during the period.

All data were recorded daily (date, working hours, weight).

**1.4. Results**

Day                       Weight (kg)      Comment  
01                          92                          Start  
06                          90                          First noticeable reduction  
16                          85                          Ketosis stable  
30                          80                          Halfway  
42                          77                          Plateau  
51                          75                          Last phase started  
67                          72                          Target weight reached  
74                          70                          End

Total weight loss: ≈ 22 kg in 10 weeks.  
Estimated distribution: 8–9 kg fat, 13–14 kg fluid/muscle.

**1.5. Observations**

·         Weight measurement was performed mainly in the morning after normal sleep and toilet visits, to ensure consistency.

·         Adaptation occurred after approximately two weeks.

·         Hunger response was significantly reduced, energy levels stable.

·         Sleep difficulties occurred during night shifts and towards the end of 72-hour fasting periods.

·         Short-term orthostatic hypotension, no persistent symptoms.

·         No headaches, cramps or electrolyte-related problems reported.

·         Physical exercise was deliberately omitted to avoid catabolic stress at extremely low energy intake.

·         Weight plateaus around 80, 77 and 75 kg were broken without adjustment of method.

·         Strict electrolyte control is considered the primary reason for stable physiological tolerance.

**1.6. Status at the end of phase 1**

Final measurement day 74, actual final weight ≈ 70 kg.  
Goal achieved within planned time and physiological limits.

**Diary and exact doses/plans not shared - only structure and principles**  
This documentation is intentionally limited to structure and outcomes. No attempt is made to generalize or recommend the approach described.

**Two-Phase Fasting–Ketosis Protocol (Documented Case)**  
**PART 2 – Habituation and stabilization**

Phase 2 does not describe what should be done after weight loss, but what actually happened when further weight reduction was no longer desired.

**2.0. Context and delimitation**

This document describes phase 2 of the same self-directed experiment as presented in Part 1. Phase 2 starts immediately after the end of the weight reduction phase and is not a new regimen, but a goal adjustment within the same overall structure.

Where Part 1 had weight reduction as the primary endpoint, phase 2 is aimed at stabilization, regulation and assessment of sustained physiological response.

**2.1. Purpose**

The purpose of phase 2 was:

·         to stop further weight loss

·         to limit reactive weight gain

·         to preserve fasting adaptation and metabolic flexibility

·         to use fasting consciously as a regulatory mechanism, with autophagy as the guiding principle

Phase 2 was explicitly not intended as normalization or termination, but as an active transitional phase.

**2.2. Structure and framework**

The basic structure from phase 1 was continued without any fundamental changes. The eating pattern remained tightly organized, with clear demarcation of meals.

OMAD/OMAS was used as the organizational framework, where OMAD was defined operationally as one whole meal consumed within a short period of time (<30 minutes), not as an open eating window.

Fasting periods were continued, but in phase 2 were used selectively and purposefully. Fasting functioned as a regulatory tool, not as a continuous driving force for further weight reduction.

No structured training was introduced in phase 2.

**2.3. Dietary transition**

The diet was gradually liberalized within the existing framework. Carbohydrates, fat and social foods were gradually reintroduced, while protein remained a stable and dominant component of the meal structure.

Increased energy density and social load were deliberately included as part of phase 2, not as normalization per se, but as a load to assess the robustness and regulatory capacity of the system.

**2.4. Regulation and control**

Body weight was used as the overall management parameter in phase 2, with a focus on trend and interval rather than individual days.

Weight appeared to be dynamically regulated rather than statically stable. After periods without fasting, weight gain was observed over subsequent days, while weight quickly fell back with targeted regulation.

No cumulative buoyancy or persistent loss of control over time was observed. At the same time, further weight loss was actively avoided.

**2.5 Results – weight development in phase 2 (acclimatization)**

Phase 2 covers the period days 75–150 and represents the transition from active weight reduction to controlled stabilization. Body weight was used as the primary outcome variable, recorded sporadically but consistently, mainly in the morning.

Overall weight picture

·         Start phase 2: \~70 kg

·         End phase 2: \~70 kg

·         Net change: ≈ 0 kg

The weight remained within a limited interval of approximately 69–73 kg throughout the entire period.

Patterns and dynamics

·         Temporary weight gain occurred after several days of eating, increased alcohol intake and reduced fasting frequency.

·         Weight reduction occurred rapidly after 48–72 hours of fasting, without the need for further restrictions.

·         No cumulative weight gain was observed, despite the reintroduction of carbohydrates, fat and socially conditioned high energy intake.

·         Further weight loss was actively avoided and in practice stopped.

Representative data points (selection)  
Day                       Weight (kg)      Comment  
75                          70                          Start phase 2  
84                          69                          Lowest observed value  
99                          70                          After several days of fasting  
117                       71                          After Christmas party  
119                       73                          Temporary peak  
122                       70                          Reversed after fasting  
148                       70                          After high alcohol exposure  
150                       71                          End phase 2

\- Overall assessment  
Weight regulation appeared responsive and reversible, not slow or progressive. The system established in phase 1 remained operational in phase 2, but with changed function: from weight reduction to active stabilization and control.

**2.6. Observations**

\- Weight  
Body weight remained within a relatively narrow interval throughout phase 2. Short-term fluctuations occurred, especially in connection with increased energy load, but were consistently reversed. No progression in either a positive or negative direction was observed.

\- Energy and general condition  
Subjective energy level and function were reported as better than before the start of the project. Willingness to take action and perceived physical capacity were consistently high, without this being attributable to changes in training load.

\- Sleep  
Sleep disturbances occurred primarily in connection with fasting periods, especially with regard to falling asleep. Outside of these periods, sleep was reported as satisfactory. Sleep was not recorded quantitatively.

\- Stomach/intestines  
Stomach and intestinal function was variable. During longer fasting periods, changes in bowel patterns were observed, while function appeared more normalized with regular food intake. The data base is not sufficiently standardized to draw strong conclusions.

\- Behavior and routine attachment  
A significant reluctance to break routines established in phase 1 was observed. Fasting and structured meal patterns appeared to be the default, even when further weight loss was not desired. At the same time, more meals were gradually introduced on certain days, without this fully replacing the established structure.

**2.7. Reflections**

Phase 2 was characterized by ambivalence between fear of further weight loss and the desire to preserve control mechanisms that effectively limited reactive weight gain.

Fasting was experienced as both easier and harder than in phase 1: easier as a result of established adaptation, harder because the goal was now precise regulation rather than linear reduction.

Increased exposure to energy-dense food and social stress increased awareness of one's own responses and need for regulation.

The experience is considered to be unsuitable for generalization. The program requires a high degree of self-discipline, continuous self-monitoring and tolerance for both physiological and psychological stress. The risk of error is considered significant in others.

 

The overall assessment is that the benefits can be significant, both physically and mentally, provided that the stabilization phase is treated as an active and conscious regulatory phase, not as an unstructured after-period.

I finally took the plunge and created a GitHub account for my Reddit user, KineticEnforcer. This is meant to be my public GitHub presence. For obvious privacy reasons, I cannot link my work GitHub account to my Reddit account, but the username was available, so I grabbed it and decided it was time to start sharing things openly.

I have always wanted a simple, easy, right to the point knowledge base system that I can just make work without friction and without extra features that I will never use. Projects like mkdocs or mdBook are truly awesome, clearly built with thousands of hours of work behind them, and they deliver exactly what they promise. That said, I personally wanted something much simpler, easier to reason about, and without layers of features I would not touch.

I wanted to see if I could build my own solution that stays minimal and practical. My original goal was very specific. I wanted to run it as a local knowledge base on a Raspberry Pi 2 W and be able to edit Markdown files directly on the system, on the fly, without a complicated setup. That idea became the foundation of this project. After many days and hours digging through the Node.js documentation and MDN, an unreasonable number of coffee mugs, and possibly two JavaScript infused meltdowns because JavaScript is the only language where \[\] == !\[\] is true and so is your decision to rage quit and become a farmer, MarkStack slowly came together.

The first project I pushed is called MarkStack:  
[https://github.com/KineticEnforcer/MarkStack](https://github.com/KineticEnforcer/MarkStack)

There is also a live demo available here:  
[https://kineticenforcer.github.io/markstackdemo](https://kineticenforcer.github.io/markstackdemo)

This is a project I have been working on for quite a while. The goal was to build a clean, practical Markdown focused stack that feels simple to use but still powerful, especially for people who live in text files, terminals, and GitHub. I tried to keep things readable, predictable, and easy to extend rather than overly clever.

I want to be upfront and say that I am not a professional developer. I learn by reading the manual, experimenting, breaking things, and fixing them. For me, learning to code is much more than just typing code. It is about understanding what the expected output should be, why something behaves the way it does, and how design choices affect usability and maintainability.

Along the way, I did get help from other developers here. That included small bug fixes, pointing out issues that could show up later if the code structure was not adjusted, and reinforcing the importance of comments and proper documentation. Those contributions genuinely made the project better, and I learned a lot from them.

I would really appreciate any feedback you are willing to share, especially around ease of use, structure, documentation, and whether the project makes sense from a fresh set of eyes. If something feels confusing, awkward, or unnecessary, I would honestly like to know.

If you have suggestions or ideas for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or a PR. I would truly love that and I am very open to collaboration and learning from others.

Why I can't help but still...still feel just love for you.  I know I should just forget you, but I never want to forget you.  I want to hate you, but all I can feel is hope that you are ok mentally and physically.  If I can't be with you, just fucking be ok, be well.  I wont forget you, I wont block you I would never have to.  It felt so unfair, so sudden.  I hope you get out of the loop life you have been miserable in.

How are you supposed to make friends in a foreign county when you didn't go to college there?? It's so easy when you attend college as everyone is of the same age group, has similar hobbies and you can connect over little things. Basically you have a pool of like minded similar aged people, and most of these friendships last a lifetime. 

People say go to the gym, but everyone is just out there to do their workout and leave after a long day's work. Most of the friendships you form as an adult feel so surface level. Like you can chat, be friendly and hang out once in a. while but it doesn't feel the same as uni or school friendships. 

  
Work life?? Everyone is so dialled in, has their own routine and responsibilities and friend group, their own partner and family and it's like you'd have to book an appointment to see someone for an hour. Work drains you in a way uni never did. You come home and have as much energy for two things, eating and lying down. Transitioning into work life seems like a mental punishment. It's like you are constantly meeting people in small doses. One coffee here, one dinner there and back to being alone again. I miss my people, friends you can be bored with, don't need to plan two weeks in advance to see them, randomly grab food or just call at 1 am.

I finally received my order from Shades of Coffee yesterday. Overall, I am very happy with the items that were delivered.

Unfortunately, there is an issue with the delivered portafilter: the thread for the double spout is crushed on one side, so the double spout cannot be screwed on. Overall, the build quality of the portafilter is not what I had hoped for. At the point where the handle attaches, it is very unevenly finished, and the wooden handle is not properly fitted to the metal. 

When I asked about it, I was told that this is all normal. Supposedly, the 'end grain' cannot be seen from the operator’s side anyway, and the thread is always pressed in like that. Can anyone here confirm this? In the photos on the website, I don’t see any such issues.

Ideally, in the living room I would love to have a sofa-bed, a small coffee table, a TV table, maybe a small bookcase, and a dinning table with 4 chairs. That's the tricky part. I can't make it fit. Feel free to suggest anything else that might fit (floor lights, bookcase etc.).

In the bedroom I hope to fit a double bed, a desk (+ office chair) as a workstation, a small office drawers cabinet next to the desk, and maybe a chest of deawers.

Since I am located in Europe, I am looking mostly at IKEA (or Jysk or similar) for inspiration and for the furniture.

Below is the floorplan. Do you have any thoughts, advice or recommendations? Feel free to share photos, suggested layouts, furniture or anything you think might be useful. I look forward to your ideas!

I'm sure many will think this is ok but honestly it just one of the main reasons game sales decline and obviously Meta will think there's no demand for some games while in reality there's but ppl just dont want to pay and dont tell me its small community or ppl can't afford it because there's massive sales going on every now and then and many games equal the price of your daily coffee 

We cannot tell if there's demand on games based on sales since many gamers are interested but dont buy the game and that certainly effected and keep effecting their sales unfortunately

My van was ready last week, but I've been stuck at work. My boss knew my van was ready and I needed to get it. Sunday at 1030pm, while we're laying down for bed, my gf says she's home on Monday. I realize that's my only opportunity to pick my vehicle up before Friday (Friday is also a maybe), so that's the plan. First thing in the morning we head to get it. I text my boss at 7:40am, telling him I'll be late, because this is my only opportunity to get my van. Usually I start at 8, planned to be there around 10. He complains about the short notice, and I remind him that I was supposed to be gone last Wednesday when my van was ready. I worked Thursday and Friday to finish the week, and I'm only working Monday and Tuesday, because he keeps talking like I'm working this entire week, so he can make money while he's on vacation skiing. I'm my opinion, you shouldn't text someone that works early in the morning, especially if it's potentially stressful, that late at night. We argue back and forth all morning about who's in the wrong, only to find out, I couldn't work at all Monday anyway, because his equipment wasn't ready. I offer to come in at 6am, instead of 8 on Tuesday, to compensate for the time lost, and we agree. He retaliated, in order to prove that 10:30pm on a Sunday night isn't too late to text, by sending me 5 consecutive messages at 1:41am, so me and my gf were woken up. All texts were related to work, but at nearly 2am. I get up early for work to get coffee in me, so I'm not groggy behind the wheel. I leave at 5:30, so I get up at 3:30, so I text him 4 consecutive messages around 3:40am, sarcastically thanking him for clearing up reasonable hours to text about work.

It had the seeds of something truly magical, but was let down by casting and execution.

A big issue for me was Issa Rae. I think she's very talented, but she was a very poor fit here. Emma Corrin was absolutely sensational — completely blew it out of the park — which only makes it sadder that the other lead couldn't match Emma's energy. None of the heavy or sweet moments really hit for me. I kept imagining what this could have been if the two leads had chemistry like in Hang the DJ or San Junipero.

The second issue was the immersion-breaking plot holes and silly situations. What was even the point of this remake? You're putting a modern actress with 2025 hair speaking in a 2025 accent into a 1940s period film and changing nothing else? Why not at least have Friday style her hair like a 1940s star and adopt the cadence — something like Josephine Baker? And the complete incompetence  of the ReDream team just took me out of it. Not verifying Friday could actually play the piano, planning to shoot everything in a single take (??? WTF) with no room for error, and a simple coffee spill literally almost killing an A list actress?

I can't help but feel a sense of sadness for a massive waste of a very high potential idea. Better casting + additional polish and script passes would have had massive returns here.",28,1768900058.0,blackmirror,17,0.8,False

Mystery isn't some dark, brooding act you put on like you're Batman. It's not about wearing all black and staring into the distance dramatically. Real mystery? It's about knowing when to shut up, when to reveal just enough, and how to keep people guessing without trying too hard.



I dove deep into this because I noticed something weird. The people everyone found ""intriguing"" weren't necessarily the smartest or most attractive. They just knew how to control information flow. So I went down a rabbit hole, consuming everything from Robert Greene's work to psychology research on charisma, even studying how cult leaders (yeah, dark territory) captivate people. What I found? Mystery is a skill. And here's the playbook.



 Step 1: Master the Art of Strategic Silence



Most people talk too much. They over explain, overshare, dump their entire life story in the first conversation. You? You're going to do the opposite.



The rule: Answer questions, but never completely. Give 70% of the answer, leave 30% hanging. When someone asks what you did last weekend, don't give them the full itinerary. ""Explored some new spots downtown"" beats ""I went to Starbucks, then Target, then watched Netflix for 6 hours.""



Research from Princeton shows that information gaps trigger intense curiosity in the brain. People literally can't help but want to fill in the blanks. You're not being secretive for no reason. You're creating psychological hooks.



The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down perfectly. She's a former advisor to Google and Harvard, and this book is basically the bible for understanding presence. One insight that hit hard: charismatic people don't dominate conversations, they know when to create pauses. This book will make you question everything you think you know about social dynamics. Best charisma book I've ever read, no contest.



Step 2: Become Unreadable (Not Emotionless)



Big difference here. Mystery isn't about being cold or robotic. It's about emotional unpredictability. If people can predict your reactions, you're boring. If they can't quite figure out how you'll respond, you're fascinating.



Mix warmth with distance. Be genuinely engaged in conversation one moment, then slightly detached the next. Laugh hard at something funny, then go quiet and thoughtful. This creates what psychologists call intermittent reinforcement, the same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive.



Pro tip from behavioral psychology: People obsess over what they can't fully understand. A study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that inconsistency in someone's behavior makes them more memorable and intriguing than consistent, predictable behavior.



 Step 3: Have a Life People Don't See



You know what kills mystery instantly? Posting every thought and activity on social media. The mysterious person isn't chronically online documenting their coffee order.



Cut your social media presence by 60%. Post occasionally, but make it interesting. Not ""here's my lunch"" but more like a photo from somewhere unexpected with zero context. Let people wonder what you're doing instead of showing them everything.



Real talk? The most mysterious people I know have entire dimensions to their lives that never make it online. They read obscure books, have weird hobbies, know random skills. Which brings me to the next point.



Step 4: Cultivate Obscure Knowledge



Mystery thrives on depth. When you drop unexpected knowledge into conversations, people pay attention. Not in a show off way, but naturally.



Read outside mainstream stuff. The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene is insanely good for understanding human nature and social dynamics. Greene studied historical figures across centuries, and this book reveals patterns of power and influence most people never see. It's controversial, sure, but it'll make you understand why certain people command rooms while others fade into the background.



BeFreed is a personalized learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create custom audio content based on what you want to learn. Built by a team from Columbia and former Google experts, it's designed for people who want depth without the time commitment.



Type in something like ""social influence strategies"" or ""charisma techniques,"" and it generates a tailored podcast, anywhere from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on your goals and interests, so content stays relevant as you progress. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with for recommendations or to clarify concepts mid-listen. The voice options matter more than you'd think, especially during commutes or workouts. Worth checking out if you're serious about continuous learning.



Also, explore niche podcasts. Lex Fridman's podcast features deep conversations with scientists, philosophers, and thinkers that give you talking points nobody else has. When you can reference something fascinating from AI research or ancient philosophy naturally in conversation, you stand out.



 Step 5: Control Your Reactions



Mysterious people don't react immediately to everything. There's a deliberate pause, a moment of thought before responding. This isn't game playing, it's self control.



Practice delayed reactions. Someone shares news? Don't immediately gush or freak out. Take a beat. Process. Then respond thoughtfully. This makes people feel like you're considering them deeply instead of just reacting on autopilot.



Stoic philosophy helps here. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (yeah, a Roman emperor's personal journal) teaches emotional regulation like nothing else. Ryan Holiday's modern interpretation in The Obstacle Is The Way makes it accessible. Holiday worked in marketing and media before diving into Stoicism, and he breaks down how ancient wisdom applies to modern chaos. Reading this shifted how I handle situations that used to throw me off balance.



Step 6: Have Boundaries People Can Feel



Mystery requires boundaries. You're not available 24/7. You don't respond to texts instantly every time. You have parts of your life that are yours alone.



The boundary principle: You can be warm and friendly without being an open book. Protect certain things, your creative projects, your family stuff, your struggles. Share selectively, and only with people who've earned that access.



Use the Finch app for building this habit. It gamifies self care and boundary setting through a cute digital bird companion. Sounds simple, but it helps you track when you're overextending yourself socially and need to pull back.



Step 7: Master the Exit



Mysterious people know when to leave. They don't overstay conversations. They don't linger awkwardly. They exit while things are still good, leaving people wanting more.



At social events: Don't be the last person there. Leave when the energy is still high. Same with conversations. End them before they run out of steam. ""I've got to head out, but this was great"" beats awkwardly running out of things to say.



Research on peak end theory shows people remember the peak moment and the ending of experiences most vividly. Exit well, and you'll be remembered positively and mysteriously.



 Step 8: Develop Genuine Interests Nobody Expects



The easiest way to seem mysterious? Actually be interesting. Have hobbies and interests that don't fit people's first impression of you.



Learn something obscure. Lockpicking. Mycology. Ancient languages. Whatever genuinely interests you but surprises others. When these things come up naturally, you become multidimensional.



Skillshare or YouTube can teach you almost anything. But pick things that fascinate you, not just things that sound cool. People can tell the difference between genuine passion and trying too hard.



 Step 9: Ask Better Questions Than You Answer



Flip the script. Instead of talking about yourself, ask questions that make people think. Deep ones. Not ""what do you do?"" but ""what's something you believed five years ago that you don't anymore?""



The power move: When someone asks about you, give a brief answer then redirect with a thoughtful question about them. People will walk away feeling like they had an amazing conversation with you, but they'll realize they still don't know much about you. Perfect.



 Step 10: Stop Explaining Yourself



Here's the final piece. Mysterious people don't justify their choices constantly. They do things and let their actions speak. No long explanations, no defending decisions, no seeking approval.



""Why'd you do that?""

""Felt right.""



That's it. You don't owe everyone a detailed breakdown of your reasoning. The more you explain, the less mysterious you become. Confidence doesn't need explanation.



This doesn't mean being rude or dismissive. Just comfortable with your choices standing on their own.



The truth is, mystery isn't manipulation. It's self possession. It's knowing your value doesn't depend on others fully understanding you. Most people are so desperate to be known and validated that someone who isn't creates natural intrigue.



Start with one or two of these steps. You don't need to become a completely different person overnight. Just pull back slightly, speak less, listen more, and let people wonder about the depths they're not seeing. That's the real trick. There is no trick. Just intentional restraint in a world that overshares everything.",2,1768899741.0,rSocialskillsAscend,0,1.0,False

I don't want their lives, but I'd like to be ABLE to have their lives, to be able to actively reject and dissent instead of not having a choice in the matter. But still, their content, that of a mundane existence, fascinates me. It's like watching The Discovery Channel or Animal Planet. Even though what they present is an elaborate farce, aspiration is provided to the masses. They are able to vicariously have their shit together by watching other people pretend to have their shit together. And some truths can be gleaned from any performance if you watch closely.

I'd been following one of these lifestyle influencers on Youtube for years because I enjoyed that albeit artificial glimpse into what normalcy is supposed to look like. Somehow I find it therapeutic to witness someone else going through their routines, even if it was fictionalized for monetary gain. The results are twofold: I am reminded how banal and repetitive everybody's existence is, something which sedates my resentment, while their own banality distracts me from my own personal version of it. I can seethe about the materialism and rampant capitalism and overconsumption and how the fuck these content creators are making hundreds of thousands per year while not producing anything of actual societal value and how they're perpetuating and encouraging ongoing social decay, desperately mining the wild west of doomsday capitalism before it all goes bust, and I know that, but my brain was infected with its pathogen too, so I watch the 30 second videos anyways because I am also held rapt by the content.The POV angles also allow you to so easily insert yourself into a mindless life, one where your problems dont exist, where all that matters is making an over the top iced seasonal coffee in a decorative glass with its decorative glass straw. It hijacks you.

I knew she lived in South Florida. She has over 1 million followers on Tiktok. She barely shows her face because she must've figured out she couldn't profit off her looks, but she could profit over 'lifestyle content.' She posted she was moving. I always wondered where in Miami she lived because I envied her small apartment, a symbol if independence I'd do anything to achieve, that I as far as I can tell can't do anything to achieve. When she posted her latest 30 second reel of her first morning in her new home, I recognized the door and I recognized the backyard. We just had new neighbors move in across the street.

This influencer now lives across my street. She had filmed that very reel, usually something so figuratively distant from me, literally several feet from me. Probably while I was sleeping in. Older than her, still living in my childhood bedroom, hurricane shutters over my window and towel tacked over it for as much coverage from the afternoon sun as possible, vanity strewn with prescription bottles and empty water bottles and supplement bottles instead of makeup and skin care, no planners or calendars in sight, less than 2000 square feet of something I'm not contributing to in any way. A fat, over ripened, leaking vestigial appendage taking up space with no claim.

She's only made one reel since she's moved in across from me. But now it's like I'm part of her reels, part of her life in a way. Those reels are reflecting so much more back to me now that they're taking place only a few steps from me. She's younger than me, 'self made', she drives a car, she's engaged. She represents all of the ways I fall short. Even if her milestones include things I'm not personally interested in achieving, it's the fact that I can't do it.

I immediately commented that I've been a follow for years and she's now my neighbor. I wrote 'welcome to the neighborhood' even though my mom and I had been shit talking the new neighbors for playing music too loud on the weekend, hopefully just a housewarming weekend thing. Shit talking is the neighborly thing to do. I then realized I'd commented on my burner account with no name or photos, so I looked like a creep. I replied to my own comment to add that Yotuube wouldnt let me comment so I went to Instagram to leave the comment on my burner account. This probably only made me seem like even more of a creep. I don't leave my house so it's not like I'd ever run into her. I just wanted to let her know because how insane is that!? What are the odds!? I don't want a friend, she's basic and doesn't appeal to me as a person at all. But she didn't even acknowledge me. What a bitch. I sent my mom her social media links and heard her watching her vlogs. Her preppy Miami accent is the type that all women who have ever bullied me have.

I actually did leave my house once since she moved in at around 11 pm, only wearing a shirt and panties, and only opening the door to my porch to excavate some bars of dark chocolate from the latest delivered groceries. I kept my eyes down and body pressed to the side so I was hiding from anyone's possible line of sight and heard loud jovial voices from in front of her house. Its a neighborhood full of older people so I wasnt expecting company. I felt especially naked and especially hairy, the pubes creeping down my thighs and the dense black layer of hair on my legs like leggings as I scavenged through every package with the chocolate of course being in the last one. The porch light was on so I could navigate. I turned around back into my house, relieved I look okay from the back, and convinced myself I wasn't spotted like some rare cryptid in the night. The werepossumwomanchild who never comes out of her house. The sad and remarkable thing is I dont even come out enough to set that precedent.  

We had almost bought the house she lived in originally. It's a two story. ""It's huge!"" everyone comments. ""She's RENTING! Everyone thinks she bought the house, but she's RENTING!"" screams my mom. We were acquaintances with the last family that lived in it. I get sad thinking about their two golden retrievers I watched live and die, that's how long they lived there. They lived there when I was healthy and when I got sick.  It feels like the duration of my life when I was healthy has been buried a couple feet further below with these new changes. I hate change, it reminds me of how stagnant my life is.

Before that last family, a lesbian couple with their adopted daughter lived in there. I used to go over all of the time. This was when I was a child. I remember helping them bathe their daughter who had a thick hemangioma on her chest. I remember thinking it was bubblegum and probably smelled like artificial grape. It disgusted me, so t's vivid in my memory. I remember their beautiful garden, tended to by a lesbian green thumb I guess. I remember getting intimate with a cactus for the first time, figuring out that if you touched one of those lovely plants they would draw blood. That backyard was an oasis. It looks so tiny and bare in the influencer's video. She should've put more production into it. The stress of the move must have had her standards slipping.

I know her next video will probably be about setting up her new home because my mom heard her vacuum on and off and on and off again, i could hear it from across the street for the moment the door was open, which means she was probably filming herself cleaning, turning the vacuum off to review her footage and then recording more. Perfecting her surroundings. Showing us how she perfects her surroundings. Ive never vacuumed my house. I get angry when my mom rams it into my room and disturbs the detritus of my life. Then again I dont get paid to shill the vacuum, the rug im vacuuming, the furniture in the shot. Can you believe her and I even share the same first name? With the same f spelling, not the ph spelling, which I never run into and am very proud of. This is a practical joke. 

Tap tap tap tap tap. Click click click click. So now she's inadvertently in my life and I can't help but contend with her. She's like this phantom hanging over the neighborhood. I feel like she and everything she represents is sitting on my chest and head as I lay here, like that painting, The Nightmare by Henry Fuseli. I can't wait for her future content. It's so close to home. LITERALLY. Will I see a peek of the outside of my house, my dark window I sit behind? But I feel awful and I don't know if I'll get used to it, another hurtful thing to coexist with, or if it'll grow bigger. I feel like a blaring advertisement of my inabilities and inadequacies is sitting right outside and listing all my defects on a marquee. I dont know what I'll do about it. Probably just continue to be rueful about it all. Probably make room for it. I mean, it already moved in. Now it's my move, but I don't have any. I can only continue to watch. It's too bad the nature of her content won't allow her to talk about the creep down the street. ",1,1768899471.0,sadchildclown,0,1.0,False

From an Earthly perspective, things were seemingly 1 to 1 with 616's world history until the post-WW2 era when the world seemingly collapsed into a mass wave of anarchy and anti-authority thinking. Some countries fell quickly, some fell over time, and some managed to stand. But even those that stood strong would be altered by the change. The age of Armageddon would last until the turn of the new millennium when thing eventually started getting back into something resembling order. But even in this new world of order, the feelings of counterculture still remained strong within the populace.

On individual levels, there would be great changes in the identities and backstories for familiar faces would be radically altered. Rather than cousins mutated by the power of gamma, siblings Lennox and Lucia Lynchpin were turned into the monstrous Hulk and She-Hulk by Lennox's study into mutate biology. A chemical compound he developed after 2 all nighters driven by his research led him to transforming into the Hulk. And a drop of the compound getting into his sister's coffee by accident led to her becoming She-Hulk later on.

Even on the cosmic scale, things are different. The usual purple planet eater is replaced by a sapient tree. The tree starts as a seed that will navigate towards planets that have the energy it needs to feed on. Once it lands, it will drain the energy from the planet, turning even the most lush paradises into barren lifeless wastelands. Once it's done feeding, it creates a new life seed to launch out into space to restart the cycle. But the silver lining for this is that the tree will decay and the energy left by the seed will restart the planet's biosphere.",1,1768899116.0,Spidersonas,0,1.0,False

1qhvwld,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeReccomendations/comments/1qhvwld/anime_recommendations/,Anime Recommendations,"Hey anime gurus, I'd like some recommends for myself to watch and some GF friendly to watch with her. She's super high on the empathy power level scale and can't handle dark/horror themes. 

My individual tastes are a stark contrast to hers(had a messed up childhood, so some pixels getting blown up or eaten doesn't move me, not one millimetre). Below is a list of stuff I've seen with my uncultured thoughts following them(most of what I like falls under the Seinen category), to provide the esteemed anime gurus with insight for recommendations they might have.

I've watched the following(unless explicitly stated otherwise). Starting with my top 5, the rest in no particular order:

Attack On Titan - One of my top 5, I think the ending was kinda mis-handled. Even if certain someone wasn't being manipulated the whole time, it showed too much to the contrary. Soundtrack is on a whole 'nother level though.

Dragon Ball(og, Z, GT, Super) - All good, one of my top 5. 

Berserk - golden age, old anime, and 2016. One of my top 5. 

Black Lagoon - One of my top 5, would watch everyday if I could. 

One-Punch Man - One of my top 5, season 1 was amazing, 2 was good, 3... look how they massacred my boy.

Death Parade - Great, narrowly edged out of my top 5. Legit cried a couple times during my watch through.

Black Clover - good, likeable supporting characters. I really resonate with Yami.

Jormungand - good, Koko is f'ing loko.

Devilman Crybaby - ok, felt like i was having a fever dream.

Naruto/Shippuuden - good, Never watching Boruto. Depowering your legendary figures to make new threats credible is lazy and not worth a watch. And if they were powerful all along, where were they when Madara was making his move?

Gundam - Og series movies, Unicorn, Thunderbolt(movies, loved 'em), wing series and endless waltz, Iron blooded Orphans, I liked these a lot. Seed - it was mama june after hot yoga, Heero soloes Athrun + Kira if suit powers were equalized(queue Kira Yamato Crying GIF), fight me. Witch From Mercury - No thanks, episode 1 was enough to turn me off it.

Goblin Slayer - good, excited for new releases for this.

Re:Zero - Great, liked the interesting spin on the MC trope.

Dandadan - ok until the doofy face guy showed up, 3 way relationship drama is irritating. GF loves the show though.

Your Name - Great, I don't always like dramas, but when I do... This one was special.

Almost all the studio Ghibli movies - good/great, only haven't seen Grave of the Fireflies. GF sobbed too much to wanna finish it.

Akira - Great, the first anime movie I watched.

Transformers Movie - Great. Prime dying was scarring as a kid.

Helsing - great, both series iterations.

Full Metal Alchemist/brotherhood - great, I liked that it got dark and didn't pull punches with the dark shit.

Pokemon - ok but not all of it, pretty lame in retrospect despite liking the games.

One Piece - No thanks, don't wanna invest in 1000+ episodes to see if i like it.

Bleach - ok until the bount arc on tv, I laughed everyone out of the room if they said they were a bleach fan during this time.

Frieren - Great, very thought provoking show. The first few episodes made me have a 1/4 life crisis.

Demonslayer - Good, lots of recency bias and hype. Swordsmith Village Arc was a snooze fest compared to entertainment district(which was absolutely amazing).

Chainsaw Man - good, it's slightly overhyped(recency bias). I do like it though.

Mob Psycho - Great, kinda limp noodled the ending a bit.

Hunter x Hunter - Great, Meruem/chimera ants arc was the shit. Reminded me a lot of the Frieza Saga in DBZ.

Yugioh - ok, lame in retrospect. I watched only until Yugi wasn't main character.

Sailor Moon - watched but don't remember a lot of it, only watched with sisters or when a certain GF I had ""liked"" anime.

Inuyasha - good, kinda mid in terms of story. But lovable Characters, that teach kids sexual harassment is funny.

Dororo - Good, shame there isn't plans to continue the anime.

Sword of the stranger - good, tobimaru was kinda irritating though.

Ninja Scroll Movie - Great, its a slopfest in terms of evil-just-to-be-evil enemies, but I liked the gruesome combat and art style. I totally didn't watch it or like it just because of the pretty naked ninja chick on tv. That'd be wrong.

Samurai Champloo - good, I wouldn't give it as much praise as others give it though.

Vinland Saga - season 1 great, season 2 ok(medieval tokyo revengers, is what I thought). 

Jujutsu Kaisen - good, more recency bias/hype. I do like the cool abilities the curses grant characters in this show. Todo is my spirit animal.

Solo Leveling - good, recency bias/hype. Its a guilty pleasure power fantasy show, I like it.

Steins;Gate - ok, couldn't get into it. I got a harem builder vibe on the first 10ish episodes I watched. I'm likely wrong, but I couldn't get invested in the MC.

Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress - ok, Kinda like princess mononoke but with zombies. Wouldn't watch it again.

Cowboy Bebop - good, some scenes were great. I couldn't get invested though, not sure why. I did finish the show though.

Eureka Seven - Ok, even as a kid watching this I couldn't relate to the 14yr old protag. Eureka was kinda cute though.

Gantz - ok, dark + nudity. One of those shows I'm surprized made it on to tv.

Promised Neverland - good, season 2 floundered the great set up season 1 laid out.

Overlord - good, another guilty pleasure power fantasy show. I could really go for some Albedo with a side of Shalltear right now.

Sword Art Online - good, watched it when I was a teen. Got super into it because of the dot//hack series and games. Couldn't get into the phantom bullet arc.

Dot//hack series - good, wouldn't watch it again, but it was a fun ride while it lasted. 

Dr. Stone - good, I liked it until stuff started magically appearing without much effort(season 2). It's a shame, considering I'm an engineering student and wanted the science show to be amazing through its entire run.

Haibane Renmei - good, still waiting for the war haibane to show up and make the show more interesting. GF loved it though.

Natsume's Book of Friends - ok, the only thing I remember is the season 1 end credits song.

Dorohedoro - good, felt like I was tripping on acid but liked it.

Arslan Senki - good, Arslan is basically Liu Bei. I wouldn't watch it again though.

Claymore - ok, good concept. Basically female witchers that lose their shit if they use their powers too much.

Tower of God - good, only seen season 1. Saw the betrayal coming from a mile away.

Arifureta - ok, another guilty pleasure power fantasy show. Wouldn't watch it again.

Redo of Healer - ok, revenge/power fantasy. Tried too hard to toe the line of dark and tv acceptable. Should've went all in on the dark side moments. Would've made the show better.

Tokyo Ghoul - ok, coffee culture was in its infancy during this anime debut. Only seen season 1, don't feel like watching it again. Funny story, I literally had someone say "" Don't talk to me until I've finished my coffee."" I looked at this person and screamed "" MF, YOU'RE TALKING TO ME! I HADN'T EVEN **LOOKED** AT YOU UNTIL YOU SPOKE!"" It turned out ok, we became friends after that.

Bungou Stray Dogs - Great season 1, Akutagawa was cool AF. I got continually baffled by the asspull non-deaths as the series went on though. No stakes, so why should I care? 

Deadman Wonderland - good, shame season 2 isn't happening.

Drifters - Great, I loved the concept. I would love season 2 to come out.

Shugurui Death Frenzy - Great, the art and story was outstanding.

Jojos Bizarre Adventure (all anime adaptations released so far) - Bizarre, good but also not. Pretty sure someone was greening out when they designed the art style for this anime(The only time I had ever greened out, I was seeing everything with the vibrant color of a Jojo episode).

Monster - good, tense and story driven. would watch again.

91 Days - currently watching, pretty damn good so far. Godfather meets anime. 

Parasyte - ok, wouldn't watch again.

Elfen Lied - ok, wouldn't watch again.

Blood Battle Blockade - good, likeable supporting characters, the insanity of having odd creatures roaming the streets normalized and eating at a table across from you is pretty interesting. 

Seirei No Moribito - good, I have a huge crush on Balsa. Wouldn't watch again, can't handle Tanda the anti-gigachad creeping on me waifu, or the GF getting angry that I was flirting with the tv whenever Balsa was on.

Made In Abyss Season 1 - good, not GF friendly. The poison swelling scene was too much for GF. I did enjoy the show in general though. Real stakes and dark atmosphere, despite the cutesy animation style.

Death Note - Good, pretty good beginner anime.

Tokyo Revengers - Blech. I usually try and give anime a fair shake by going 10 episodes, but I couldn't with this. Re:Zero premise but without any redeeming qualities IMO. I don't like the asskicked --> Cry --> emotions --> asskicked cycle Takemichi goes through almost every episode. GF liked it, but I vetoed watching it.

Hell's Paradise - good, excited for season 2.

B: The Beginning - good, what's it with good anime with interesting story getting production hell, while we get 300+ episodes of slop?

1qhvw1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qhvw1p/aitah_for_not_hating_on_my_brothers_ex_after_they/,AITAH for not hating on my brother’s ex after they broke up?,"I’ll try and give as much context as I can, I’m sorry if it’s too rambly. 

So me (39F) and my brother (38M) have always been close, despite the fact that my mom is a raging narcissist and basically does everything you can imagine a narcissistic mom do. I have always been the scapegoat and my brother the golden child. Everybody within our family and even their friend circle knows this and sees this, but my parents obviously deny it. 

My mom especially put my brother on a pedastal so high, he doesn’t see the problem with her most of the time. I mean, it’s hard to see a problem with somebody who thinks he can do wrong and blames every problem on their sister. 

Nevertheless, we have always been close. I got over my jealoussy in our teenage years and saw that this isn’t his fault but my mom’s and I never blamed him for this situation. My mom always called him if me and her had an arguement and for years he put up with it but once he told her he’s had enough, he doesn’t want to be involved in our drama anymore - for context, I have never called him to complain about my mom. 

I have three kids and live about 1,5 hours from my brother and about 3hrs from my parents, so we don’t meet very often. 

My brother had a failed marraige, after which I tried to take care of him as much as my family duties let me. It took him a while to get over this but then finally he had a new girlfriend, let’s call her Rayne. She is a lovely girl and we hit it off instantly. Both her and my brother are well established musicians with a fan base and as she’s a singer, we would listen to her music on spotify with my little family too. 

After about 1.5 years they broke up, and I didn’t really understand the whole thing. She was madly in love with my brother and to us they seemed perfect. Out of the blue he comes out and says that they broke up, and that she’s mentally ill because she’s been severly abused in more than one way before, and she’s just broken, and he can’t fix her and because of this he broke up with her. She was apperently blackmailing her with taking her life if he broke up with her. What rubbed me the wrong way was when he said ‘you have no idea what I’ve been through’  and he besically said that she was sick but he couldn’t be bothered so he left her and he was expecting sympathy from us for HIM. Me and my husband found this super strange and felt like there was something he wasn’t telling us, because this just didn’t make sense but obviously I just thought, it’s his life and he’s my brother so I’ll be there for him anyway. He told us that he left her in their flat and that he is staying with a friend we don’t know. At the end, he kept the flat (it’s a rental) and she moved out so he moved back in. 

Me and Rayne kept in touch in the beginning but I quickly drew a boundary and said we cannot talk about my brother. The messages fizzled out in a few months and we really only stuck to basic messages like her saying happy birthday to one of my kids or me congratulating her on her new music video, etc.

My brother told us about 2 months ago (4 months after the breakup with Rayne) that he has a new girlfriend, let’s call her Kayla.

Two weeks ago,my grandfather passed away and I travelled to my hometown with my brother. On the way back I asked him if he would have a problem with me meeting his ex for a coffee or something when I was in her city in a few weeks as I will have some time to spare. He got really mad and said this was crazy offensive to him and Kayla and he doesn’t understand how I could even think that this was okay. I was a bit baffled but said fine, if that’s how he feels, I won’t keep in touch with her. And i thought that was it. 

He was going on and on about how amazing Kayla is (she seems like a fantastic girl tbh, I really liked her when we met), and that he’s basically been staying at her place for months now. It made me wonder about the timeline of things so I aksed if there was an overlap between Rayne and Kayla and he got so mad and offended and said he would never do that. I said okay, fine, he wasn’t really sharing details so it left me confused, I wasn’t accusing him of anything anyway. 

Two days after this I got a call from him. He basically laid out that he has a bad feeling about me and my family and he knows we are hiding something from him and he is convinced that I’m still in touch with Rayne. He feels that this is very disrespectful towards her and Kayla and he will not bring her into our family until the Rayne-mania is over within my family. I was completely taken aback obviously and I didn’t understand where this came from. He claims that because I asked if there was an overlap and because I didn’t stop my daughter listening to Rayne’s music, he knows (not thinks) that I am in touch with Rayne and that I am spying on him for her. This shocked me even further obviously. I explained that this is in fact untrue and I’m not saying there was no communication at all but to prove that there is nothing like this going on, I offered him screenshots of all my messages with Rayne since their breakup - which he denie. He said it would be unethical to read other people’s messages to which I said I think it’s unethical to claim something and not ask. I told him repeatedly that I am not lying, offered him proof, which he denied, and basically said he doesn’t care and he knows that I’m lying and he won’t bring Kalya into this. Also, he thinks I’m a hypocryte for smiling at Kayla while I’m still in touch with Rayne. And he is so embarassed about this that he won’t even tell Kayla about this whole thing. I told him that he would be a hypocrite smiling at me while claiming that I’m a liar, so he isn’t welcome at our family anoymore. 

One other thing worth mentioning is that he said he didn’t ask me and decided to claim instead because he wanted to see my reaction and because I ‘acted’ so shocked and offended and desperate, it further proved to him that he is right and I’m lying.

I have been crying for days over this and I’m at a loss at what to think. He’s never really acted this way before. I don’t think there’s a way back from here because I asked him what he wanted me to do for this to change and he kept saying that I know. I kept telling him that I don’t understand, but he insisted that I know what to do. We hung up and I feel like this is the end of our relationship and this came seemingly out of nowhere.

I consider myself a decent, grounded, and emotionally mature person. Clean conversations, consent, comfort, and mutual interest matter a lot to me. If we click, great. If not, no awkwardness.

She just has a rough manner. She has been staying with us for a few weeks now due to some relationship issues with her husband, and ever since she got here we are constantly repairing things.

My wife and I have lived in our home for almost 20 years and we do regular maintenance and upkeep like most people, but the SiL seems to have carnage following her around. First night she was here she broke the shower organizer, putting the shampoo back. We tossed it up to bad luck. Next morning, she dropped the soap dish, then pulled the toilet paper holder out of the wall later that day.

We were still laughing at her being klutzy until she broke the paddle off the fridge door ice dispenser.  I started watching her closely and saw she is just rough on everything, drawers and cupboard doors get yanked open and slammed shut.  She pushed the buttons on the TV remote so hard they got stuck, then slammed the remote down on the coffee table hard enough to break the battery cover. I repeatedly asked her to be more gentle, but she said she didn’t know what I was talking about.

New Years Eve we had friends and family over and SiL wanted to make a big pan of nachos. Our gas range is a Bertazzoni, a very expensive highend Italian brand. It was already here when we moved in, the previous owners had designed the kitchen around it. It is built very robustly, but the SiL still managed to break a knob off.

It took me until today, 3 weeks, to find where I can order a replacement knob from and that it is going to cost $128.00+shipping. For a fucking knob, for a 28 year old appliance. I mentioned the replacement cost to the SiL, who is both living here for free and also has not been charged for anything she has broken yet, and she was dismissive. It struck me at that moment that she has never apologized, nor offered to pay for anything she has broken.

There were a few elderly people sitting in the chairs that are specifically there for them while they wait for their turn. Totally normal.

Then this guy just walks up and cuts right in front of all of them. I spoke up and said hey they were already in line. Without even looking at me he goes I dont see them standing in line though. Real smug about it. The elderly people looked uncomfortable but none of them said anything. I guess they didnt want to make a scene.

So I dropped it. But I was annoyed.

A few minutes later were both still in our lanes and I notice his cart is full of what looks like camping stuff. Sleeping bag paper plates marshmallows instant noodles a portable stove. And sitting right on top was a single can of butane gas.

Thats when I saw my opportunity.

He was on his phone not paying attention to anything around him. So I just casually reached over grabbed the butane and slid it into my cart. He didnt notice at all. He paid for his stuff and left. I paid for mine including the butane and went home.

Somewhere out there this guy probably showed up at his campsite ready to cook his food and make coffee.

 And when he went to use that portable stove he realized he had no gas. No hot food. No coffee. Just dry noodles and hopefully a long annoying night.

1qhvp2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1qhvp2i/my_father_is_making_odd_faces_depression_or_not/,my father is making odd faces (depression or not depression?) Need advice from others...,"My father has had a history of depression (bipolar personality) traits so I will say in chronological order that when I was 7 years old, my dad stopped going to work and then overdosed on medication. He was apparently acting depressed and then ended up in the hospital. After this happened, he spent months in a rehab center and then took years to get better. Then, in 2016 he started doing the same depressed behavior again when my mom said she was going to divorce him. He sad in bed for months and acted strange around my mom and then ended up in a psychiatric ward in 2017 for 3 months. My mom still divorced him but it was delayed by a couple years because he stopped going to work and she had to support him. He took another 3 years to get better (by better I mean for the medication he took to ween off of him as he acted slow in his speech and driving for 2-3 years after 2017). 

  
My father has intense ADD, mood swings, and a very *intense* personality. He has seemed to be back to his normal mindset the past couple years but now I am feeling like he is descending back into his depressed behavior because of the following reasons:

1. My mother recently called him (4 days ago) and got mad at him and said she would never speak to him again. 

2. He acted fine for 2 days and then started complaining to me he had a headache. 

3. After I took him to urgent care, he claimed to me that they said that he just seemed tired, nervous, and stressed out. 

4. He started making weird faces and trembling when he speaks (which is very uncomfortable to be around) since leaving the urgent care. 

Specifically by weird faces I mean that he seems like he is now constantly squinting. I don't know if he is just tired or exhausted or what but it is very odd. He also trembles when he speaks (sounds like cowardly lion from wizard of oz would be the best comparison). He acts sad and has said to me he cannot handle that my mom told him to ""f off and leave her alone forever."" My mom has been irritated by my dad (who she divorced) after he recently asked her for a few loans of money. I know this is getting into family drama but I have to give some context to explain. Anyways, based on the above, I would like to get anyone's opinions on whether he is truly depressed or just faking it (to win back my mom into speaking to him again?) Also, during the afternoon hours he sometimes sounds completely back to normal and has sent me texts saying ""my brain is clear I drank hot coffee...one day at a time."" 

  
I am truly wondering because he has behaved this way before in order to prevent my mom from leaving him (which somewhat stalled her but she still ultimately left him). This behavior financially ruined my father and his relationship with my mother and distanced himself from me. I am not sure if I should seek a mental counselor for my father or tell him that it is making me uncomfortable. Sometimes...deep down...I feel like he is trying to make me uncomfortable (or think something it wrong with him) so that I will do something like tell my mother to speak to him again. I am not sure what behavior I am dealing with or if I am dealing with serious mental illness that I need to address with a professional.

I’m an MBA student and was fortunate to receive summer associate offers from all three MBB firms. I’m incredibly grateful, but now that I’m past the adrenaline of recruiting, I’m finding the decision harder than expected.

On paper, all three feel like amazing opportunities. Where I’m struggling is how to actually decide between them beyond brand name and comp.

Some things I’m thinking about:

	•	Day-to-day experience as a Summer Associate

	•	Staffing flexibility vs. structure

	•	Feedback, mentorship, and promotion dynamics

	•	Office culture differences (especially outside HQ offices)

	•	Exit opportunities and long-term optionality

	•	How much the internship experience truly differs across firms

I’ve done coffee chats, spoken to recruiters, and heard the usual high-level comparisons, but I’d really value first-hand perspectives from people who:

	•	Interned at MBB and chose one over the others

	•	Switched between MBB firms

	•	Regret (or strongly don’t regret) their choice

If you were in my position again, what factors would you weigh most heavily for the internship decision, and what do you wish you’d known at the time?

Found out about a week ago my girlfriend of almost 5 years is cheating. Planning on leaving this note for her then going to my tattoo appointment so she has time to read and process it. 
I want to know if anyone thinks anything in here is too harsh?
While I'm heartbroken and crushed I just want peace while we figure out how to split up our lease and car loan. I can see her pulling some crazy stuff. I don't know what exactly but if anyone else has ever dealt with a compulsive liar that cheats, whats the fallout on this situation gonna be like? 😬 



I don't know what world youre living in that you can't even admit to yourself you're unfaithful. Or how in any world you think I would want to stay and live with being treated like this. 
I've had to beg you from practically the beginning of our relationship to give me basic needs and equal labor. Not physical labor but the emotional labor of carrying this relationship. I tried so hard in the beginning to tell you I felt neglected, touch starved and unappreciated. Every little word of advice on how to better love and understand me was ignored time and time again. Eventually I stopped. About a year ago.
Most of the times I tried to bring up how I felt, you took it as a personal attack and emotionally turned the tables so I ended up feeling bad and regretted ever trying. 
There were times where you heard my frustration and said ""okay, I'll do better"" but your words never matched your actions. Or you do try but it's inconsistent. 
Every time I asked you to please not leave your coffee cup *with coffee* in it on the counter because it's not safe for the cats-and you still do that shit. That's just one example; you constantly display signs of not giving a shit about anyone or anything around you and it's not attractive. You're neglectful. Just look at your dog, I know I don't need to explain that. 

I do have some questions for you.
Why?
If you love me and you're not miserable then why would you do this? 
Why can't you be honest?
I dont need the answers, but you do. 

I've known about your cheating for a little over a week now and as I've had time to reflect on our relationship I've genuinely never felt more stupid in my life. There's no way this was going to work. 
I was 20 and you were 26 when we met. At the time I couldn't comprehend or forsee 6 years being that much of an age gap but it's there. 
We should have never dated fresh out of divorces, we're both to blame. 
Throughout the relationship I continuously let our communication and behaviors get worse. I enabled your inability to take care of yourself. 
I dedicated the first 2 years of our relationship to just taking care of you and making sure you were happy and didn't have to lift a finger at home and I'm sure that was great for you but it's not sustainable for me.
When I look back at the last 5 years I don't even feel like I was my own person for part of it. I just existed to please you. 
When I started investing more in myself I noticed how much I was putting into the relationship and how i just continually felt unloved. Yeah things were fine for the most part. But they were never great. I feel like we're just roommates that say I love you. 

Obviously I can only speak from my side of things. But I made an honest attempt. I really did love you there in the beginning. All love starts out that way. But then life happens and we learned more about each other. Over time I knew it wasn't meant to be, and that's okay. Those things happen but I regret not doing something about it years ago. I guess I was holding out hope you'd miraculously not be selfish and neglectful. I'm sorry I wasn't more honest and direct sooner. I realize now this is probably more my fault for letting this get this far. 

I want you to know in the end it's gonna be okay. You get to choose how you're going to handle this. You can make me out to be the villain in your story if you want. But I don't think it'll help you be happy in the long run. I hope you take this as an unfortunate learning experience and grow from it. Get therapy and be honest during your sessions. There's no point in being there if you're not digging up dirt.
You need to learn how to take care of yourself and most importantly love yourself. 

Please take time to process this information, feel your emotions. I know this sucks, it doesn't need to be worse. I hope that we can work together in the end to make this as easy of a breakup and transition into different living situations, as possible.
