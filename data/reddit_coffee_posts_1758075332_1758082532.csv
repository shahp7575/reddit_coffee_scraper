I stopped for a couple of years tho and started smoking once a month or so. 

Anyway it’s illegal in my country and well i got caught by the cops. Now i gotta get tested regularly though and if i get caught again im going to prison. She actually can’t see the records but someone ratted me to her so i had to spill. 

She is scared bcs weed is a gateway drug, that i will essentially do the golden shot, that my brain will rot by the time im 30 (im 26), and that i am not telling her about the other drugs im doing (im not). 

I bought her flowers, tried telling her weed doesnt always lead to the use of harsher drugs, that im so sorry that i lied to her but it was because i knew this would be her reaction. 

I saw her crying while drinking her coffee today and its been 3 days since she found out. My heart ripped apart in a million pieces. Seeing her sad was the saddest part of the whole ordeal. 

So reddit what do i do, i cant take it anymore. ",1,1758082250.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

Hey there,

I’m looking to connect with someone genuine who enjoys good conversation, laughter, and building a real connection. Friendship is always the starting point, but I’m open to seeing where things can naturally go whether that’s just good company, something casual, or eventually more.

A little about me: I’m 33, 5’10”, athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. People would describe me as laid back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down to laugh. My work keeps me busy with odd hours, but I actually enjoy the flexibility it gives me. I can travel and usually work around different schedules pretty easily.

When it comes to interests, I’m all about the outdoors during spring, summer, and fall whether that’s hiking, camping, being out on the water, or just a long walk with good company. In the colder months I switch gears and keep it cozy with reading, cooking, binging shows, or relaxing with coffee and good conversation. I also really value physical connection and quality time. It’s my way of feeling close to someone.

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s fun, witty, playful, and open minded. Consistency matters to me, and I’d love to find someone who enjoys both the silly side of things and the deeper conversations. Someone who’s not afraid of a little sarcasm, loves to laugh, and appreciates genuine connections.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message. I’d be glad to get to know you.

30F here. I have a friend who I used to work with until June 2023 when we both resigned. Ever since (~2yr), we have walked together every Friday morning with our dogs. We meet @ 5:30am, same place each week, get a coffee & walk the same route.

We used to share the coffee purchasing - her one week, me the next.
Over the past 6 months she has consistently shown up 15-20min late, leaving me with the coffee purchase each week. While ~$12/week doesn't break the bank, the principle is really starting to get to me. Each week she shows up late, gets greeted with a purchased coffee, doesn't apologise, sometimes makes excuses, other times doesn't even mention it and we just start our walk.

Our financial circumstances are pretty similar, so it's not a matter of affordability. I live further away from our meeting spot (30min vs 15), and manage to make it on time every week. Am I wrong for feeling this way? How would you address it? It's gotten to the point where I don't enjoy the walks (like, dread them) as the constant lateness is making me feel really disrespected.",1,1758081667.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

Breakfast:

Bagel (homemade) + cream cheese $0.50
Banana $0.50
Pot of Coffee and flavored creamer for the day $1.50

~$2.50 for breakfast, off to a good start.

Lunch and snack:

1 pb&j, 1 turkey sandwich (homemade bread, pb, jelly, mayo, mustard, turkey, cheese, tomato, lettuce) $4.00

2 flavored seltzer waters- $1

Loose almonds- $1

~$6.00 for lunch

Dinner curry stew:

I already have a loaded pantry with spices so this is harder to calculate exactly but I'll just say $1.00 for what I used of:

Curry powder
Lime Juice
Ginger
Garlic
Oil
Garlic
Salt
Pepper
Crushed red pepper

3 potatos
2 Bell peppers
2 cups chick peas
1 white onion
2 cans coconut milk
3 zucchini 

$11

So a $12 pot of stew that is good for 3 meals= $4 dinner plus I had some candy and other little snacks/ drinks so I'm going to say $6 for dinner total.

That's $14.50 for the day with me making my own breads and already having all of that stuff on hand and enjoying cooking.

Today was definitely a cheap day for me just coincidentally. Usually there will be more expensive dinners because I like meat and I'm not on a food budget.

No way the freaks that end up in front of Caleb are spending $10/day or less on food and I think it just serves to quickly discourage his guests because they probably try to follow his meal plan for a day or two, see that it won't work for them then just say ""fuck it"" to all the other advice they got.

Tomorrow is the day 53 years ago, when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas Texas.  Still there are researchers that are analyzing every piece of information they can get ahold of. Thanks to the internet the information seems endless. This year I discovered many new pieces I did not know existed, because my focus has been on Lee Harvey Oswald. Today along that same line I am going to focus on the policeman that Oswald was accused of Killing Officer J.D.Tippit.

The murder of Officer Tippit was the reason the police stormed the theater pulling Oswald out and arresting him… Not much has been written about him as historically he has been seen a bit player in this drama. Now there is more information revealed that indicates he may have a much bigger role in the assassination than first thought. Who is Officer J.D. Tippit?

He started with the Dallas Police Department in 1952. He also had 2 other part time jobs, one at Austin BBQ and another at Stevens Park Theater. He was a family man, married with three children. In the Dallas Police Department, he was car #10, badge #848. Over the years Tippit was accused of being part of the assassination of Kennedy, and others have said he was part of the plot to take out Oswald at the end. Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act and diligent researchers so much more has been uncovered.

Tippit’s beat #78 was in the Oak Cliffs residential area of Dallas, it is also in the same general area as Oswald’s rooming house. Tippit’s movements that day indicate he started his morning with eggs at the Dobbs House Restaurant, 2 blocks from Oswald’s rooming house, just outside his beat. It is said that Oswald ate there also, though there is no indication of him doing so that day. Tippit frequently went in and out of his beat throughout the day.

**As we shall see, there are other reports of him being far from his patrol district on a regular basis. For Tippit to have a coffee break at Dobb's House at 1221 N. Beckley, it would take a minimum of 15 minutes to get there from his patrol district, about 10-15 minutes for coffee and at least 15 minutes to get back to Tippit's assigned patrol district. A grand total of about 45 minutes. It defies logic that the Dallas Police Department would authorize a coffee break location that was that far from Tippit's Patrol District.**

**A 1966 article in “Ramparts” magazine by researcher, William Turner states that on a recent trip to Dallas, he “uncovered five witnesses to Tippit’s whereabouts the last minutes of his life. There is no indication that the Commission or any police agency was even aware of them. Photographer, A Volkland, and his wife, Lou, both of whom knew Tippit, said that 15 or 20 minutes after the assassination they saw him at a gas station and waved to him. They observed Tippit sitting in his police car at a Gloco gas station in Oak Cliff, watching the cars coming over the Houston Street Viaduct from downtown Dallas. (1)**

**At approximately 1:10-1:15pm Tippit was driving east on East 10****^(th)** **street. He pulled alongside a man, most believed to be Oswald. The man walked over to Tippit’s car, they exchanged words. Officer Tippit got out of the car, at which time the man thought to be Oswald pulled out a gun and fired five shots in succession. Officer Tippit fell to the ground. Two bullets hit him in the chest, one in the stomach and one in his right temple, one completely missed. He was pronounced dead at Methodist Hospital at 1:25. They arrested Oswald because he was acting suspiciously and he snuck into the Texas Theater without paying. (2)**

**The next question is, “Was J.D. Tippit the second patsy?”  Many believe he was.** The President was killed outside of Oswald’s work place and 30 minutes later a police officer killed near his home, this would pave the way to an open and shut case – one that would of course never go to trial.

JD Tippit didn’t know what was coming. He had been ordered to be on the lookout for Oswald. Later his wife, Marie Tippit, would learn this from a fellow policeman, according to author Joseph McBride in the book ***“Into the Nightmare”***. This would actually mean that Tippit looked for Oswald before the Dallas Police arrested him and officially knew who Oswald was. Most likely Oswald wasn’t the only patsy that day. JD Tippit was sacrificed and his wife was financially well taken care of. (3) Officer Tippit had to die that day to lead the people to that Theater and Oswald.

There are a couple of interesting facts, in one account theater ticket taker Warren “Butch” Burroughs said he sold a ticket to Oswald, that he did not sneak in.  As I said in a previous blog, another theory is that the killers of Kennedy created a second Oswald, and this patsy would follow a script to make sure Oswald was blamed.  The imposter stepped outside Oswald’s rented room at 1:01-04 and Oswald walked into the theatre at 1:00- 07, while Tippit was killed at 1:04-06, there are ample (circumstantial) evidence of three simultaneous scenes a mile apart.  His identity is not really important, but besides suggested imposters such as Larry Crawford, Michael Paine, Thomas Masens and others, there was one who looked surprisingly much like Lee Harvey Oswald and who went by the name of Don Norton. (4)

 

**Jim Garrison, District of Attorney of Orleans Parrish, Louisiana and the focal point of Oliver Stone’s** ***“JFK”*** **movie, did not believe Lee Harvey Oswald killed Tippit. He stated in an interview with** ***Playboy*****, that** two men, neither of whom was Oswald, were the real murderers of Tippit; he believed we have one of them identified. The critics of the Warren Report have pointed out that a number of the witnesses could not identify Oswald as the slayer, that several said the murderer was short and squat — Oswald was thin and medium height — and another said that two men were involved. (5)

Garrison was quoted as saying, “I could go on and on recounting similar instances, but there is no doubt that there was indeed a “second Oswald.” Now, the Warren Commission recognized that the individual involved in all these activities could not be Lee Oswald; but they never took the next step and inquired why these incidents of impersonation occurred so systematically prior to the assassination.” (6)

Garrison went on to say that evidence appeared staged, from the scene on the 6^(th) floor of the Book Depository to the cast-off gun cartridges and finally to the theater Oswald snuck into. Oswald did not physically have the time to get from the Book Depository to the area Tippit was shot in. That really supports the theory of a second Oswald, but Garrison goes on to say that the Warren Report found Oswald guilty in spite of the evidence not because of it.

Officer J.D. Tippit’s funeral was held the same day as Oswald’s and President Kennedy’s, November 25, 1963.  He won several awards posthumously, Medal of Valor †, Police Medal of Honor †, Police Cross †, Citizens Traffic Commission Award of Heroism †.

We sat in the motel room. I was nursing my drink and Gus was helping himself to a cup of instant coffee. 
    “So, what exactly are you going to do?” I asked. 
   He took a sip from his cup and cleared his throat.
“The killings appear to be spontaneous, that is, until you look a little closer,” he said before pulling out a notebook from his backpack. He shuffled through the pages of the notebook and showed me a page that was somewhere in the middle. 
A crudely glued on map of the town was covered in pen markings. 
   “All of the locations have been at places where there’s nobody around,” he said. 
   “At most there’ll be three people, but it’s never in a heavily populated area,” he said. 
“Well, as heavily populated a town like Wayfield can be,” he chuckled. 
   “How many people have been found dead?” I asked. 
“About thirteen,” he replied. 
   My mouth was open as I stared at him in shock. 
   “Thirteen?” I asked. 
“That’s including the three victims from tonight,” he said. 
    He closed his notebook and put it back into his backpack. 
   “We need to act fast, the behavior is changing and it’s not for the better,” he said. 
“How so?” I asked with a raised eyebrow. 
   “Take the killing of the lobby boy. He was maybe a hundred feet away from a diner. The church on the other side of town is not too far away from the town's Walmart,” Gus said. 
   “What does that mean exactly?” I asked. 
He chugged down his instant coffee and looked like he was about to gag for a moment. 
   “That means, it’s getting comfortable with being near more people. I’d say we have only a matter of time before he starts going after large crowds,” he explained. 
   “What do you plan on doing?” I asked sheepishly. 
   He threw out the paper coffee cup and looked out the motel window. 
“We have to kill a werewolf tomorrow night,” he proclaimed. 
   “What the hell do you mean we?” I sneered. 
He turned around and faced me. 
“You said you’re a journalist? Well, isn’t this a story that someone like you would kill for?” He asked. 
   “I don’t know, this is kind of out of my comfort zone,” I said. 
    He nodded his head and rubbed his chin. 
“I see,” he said. 
   “Did you go to school to be a journalist?” He asked.
“I did but I don’t really see what this has to do with anything,” I said. 
   “Well, when you were in school. Did you fantasize about being the journalist who went on the cutting edge? The reporter who looked death in its eyes and wrote a story on it? Or did you go to school to talk about shitty diner food in small towns?” He asked. 
   “I thought the diner's food was rather pleasant,” I said. 
He glared at me and extended his hand as a handshake. 
“This is a one-time deal. Are you a real journalist or are you a fluff writer?” He asked. 
I stood up and walked towards him. 
  “You have a way with words,” I said before shaking his hand. 
“Excellent,” he said. 
“Then tomorrow night, we kill a werewolf,” he added before leaving and walking into the night. 
——-9
“I’d have to say that this is by far the most…interesting assessment you’ve put me on,” I said into the phone. 
   There was silence for a moment. 
“What do you mean by that?” He asked. 
   I stared out the window and saw the morning sun shining down on the motel parking lot. 
     “There have been several developments that have occurred and I haven’t even been here a full day so far,” I said. 
   “Well, that’s good…hopefully. Send me some of your notes when you get a chance,” he said.
   I saw outside that a big black van had rolled up into the parking lot of the motel.
   “I certainly will sir,” I said before hanging up. 
I quickly put on my shoes and grabbed my keys and wallet. 
If something was going down, I didn’t want to be a part of it. 
   I made sure my door was locked and I started walking towards my car. The black vans engine wasn’t running and my fight or fight was starting to kick in. 
  I reached my car and started fumbling with the keys until the van door opened. 
I looked over and saw Gus VonHammer getting out. 
  “Where are you going this fine morning?” He asked. 
   My heart started to slow down. 
   “I just kind of figured I’d get something for breakfast,” I said. 
   “I have protein bars in my van. We don’t have time for breakfast,” he said before waving at me to come over. 
   “Where are we going exactly?” I asked as I walked over to him. 
  Gus got back into the driver's seat and I opened the passenger side door. 
A slew of empty soda bottles and meat stick wrappers lay in the seat before Gus had quickly swept them to the floor. 
   “We need to get supplies and then we need to cover our ground,” he said while starting the van's engine. 
I looked behind me and saw the back of the van, it was surrounded by tote boxes, all of them marked with a small description. 
In the middle of the van's floor was a yellow-stained mattress with a sad blanket and a limp pillow. 
  “I’m also planning on trying to get some information from the locals. We need to find out what places these people tend to congregate at during the evenings,” he said. 
	“Tipping cows, I would imagine,” I said sarcastically. 
	Gus scoffed at me and rolled his eyes. 
“This is a serious matter, Conner,” he said while pulling out of the motel parking lot.  
	“There is a bloodthirsty killer on the loose, and if we don’t act fast, more innocent blood will be spilled,” he proclaimed. 
As we were driving down the road, it dawned on me that a stranger got me into his van with the promise of candy. I bet Mom would be so proud of me right now. 
	As I was finishing up the protein bar the Gus had given me, we pulled into the Walmart parking lot. 
	“So, what supplies are we getting exactly?” I asked.
“We need to get bait,” Gus said as he unbuckled himself. 
	“Since this specific American lycanthrope has gotten a taste for human flesh, we can’t use beef like I would normally use,” he said while getting out of the driver's side. 
I got out and started following behind him, 
“We need to go with pork. It has a texture that tastes similar to human flesh and that might just be enough to help attract it,” he explained. 
The parking lot was almost crammed to the brim. A slew of shoppers were entering and leaving, they looked like ants around an ant hill.
“Is it usually this busy here?” I asked. 
  Gus stopped for a second and looked at me. 
“I’ve only been here for a week, how would I know?” He asked. 
  I shrugged my shoulders, “It was really more of a rhetorical question,” I said.
   We entered the mouth of the Walmart and Gus grabbed a cart.
It was at that moment that I noticed that Gus VonHammer was wearing cargo shorts and a trenchcoat together, the man truly is a fashion icon. 
Families were all around us, they seemed alert and on edge. They seemed itching to start a fight no matter how small it might be. 
   “Pork steaks are going to be what we aim for but pork chops can be a decent substitute,” Gus said. 
  “Okay but, why exactly?” I asked. 
The wheels on the shopping cart wobbled back and forth like a top that had just been spun. 
“Pork steaks are bigger in length and fairly thin, that’ll make it easier to attach,” he explained. 
  “However, with pork chops, we can poison them,” he added. 
 I looked around at the shopping carts going past us. They all seemed filled to the brim with cases of water, canned food, and what one might call home defense gear. 
	“Are you going to fill them with silver?” I asked. 
“What? No! Silver is way more expensive than people realize,” he said. 
	It was at that moment that as Gus was facing me, he bumped into another shopping cart. 
Under a normal circumstance, this would be a situation where the two parties apologize and go on with their day. 
	However, we were rather far from normal circumstances. 
“Hey! What the fuck is your deal dickhead?” a towering man with a mullet and sideburns asked. 
“I do apologize about that,” Gus said with a heavy dose of sincerity. 
	“You trying to size me up boy?” the man asked. 
He was wearing bright green crocs and an obnoxiously yellow pair of basketball shorts that paired rather well with his gangster Bugs Bunny smoking weed and holding a desert eagle t-shirt. 
“No, I’m really not, it was just an accident,” Gus said. 
“Baby, is everything okay?” a blonde woman asked as she ran up behind him. 
“This dickhead is trying to size me up,” he said. 
The woman was wearing a Cookie Monster shirt and a pair of hot pink booty shorts that had the words “Eat it while it’s hot” over her crotch. 
It was at that moment that I started to wonder if I was overly dressed. 
“I promise you, I am not trying to size you up,” Gus insisted. 
The man clenched his fist and I could see the vein popping in his forehead. 
	“Baby, don’t do anything dumb,” the woman said with desperation in her eyes. 
Everyone around us had stopped shopping entirely, all of them glued to us like a child watching an ISIS beheading video. 
Gus raised his hands into the air. 
“If I was trying to size you up, why would I do it in a place this busy?” Gus asked. 
“If I tried to pick a fight with you, there's a high probability I would be getting my shit rocked by every man here with the exception of Conner,” Gus explained while pointing at me. 
“Don’t bring me into this,” I whispered. 
The man said nothing for a moment while his partner caressed him. 
“Baby, please don’t do this,” she begged him. 
The man pointed at Gus and I. 
	“If y’all try that shit again, I’m beating the fuck out of you,” he said.
It would be a cold day in Hell before I let a grown man wearing crocs in public beat me up but I stayed quiet. 
“Sounds like a plan,” Gus said before grabbing his shopping cart handle. 
The four of us began to walk away slowly while the two men kept their eyes locked.
“Anyways, I was going to load the pork chops with rat poison and antifreeze,” Gus said nonchalantly. 
“However, we’ll be limited on how we can attach. They don’t bend that well,” he said. 
When we made it to the meat section, it had all been picked clean.
I looked over at Gus. 
“What’s the plan now?” I asked. 
Gus had a surprised look plastered on his face. 
“It’s a werewolf, not a blizzard. Why is everyone panic buying?” He asked aloud. 
As a woman was walking past us, Gus raised up his hand as if he was asking a question. 
The woman had on big black over the ear headphones and was wearing jeans and a green “Jesus loves you!” Shirt. 
Her shopping cart was filled with cases of water and canned food. 
“Hello, sorry to interrupt you ma’am,” Gus said. 
The woman stopped and took off her earphones. 
“Is everything okay?” She asked.
“Hello yes, so my associate and I aren’t from around this area, is there something going on?” He asked. 
She looked at Gus like he had grown another head. 
“Y’all really must not be from around here,” she said. 
“A bunch of people have been found dead,” she said.
Gus nodded his head. 
“Oh I know, that’s why we’re here,” he said.
The woman’s face got even more confused. 
“Why is everyone panic buying?” Gus asked. 
Still in a state of bewilderment the woman leaned closer to us. 
“If y’all aren’t from around here, I reckon y’all leave,” she said. 
“And to answer your question: they are putting us on a curfew. Nobody can leave their house from sundown to sunrise,” she added. 
“Thank you ma’am,” Gus said before reaching into his pocket and grabbing a business card. 
He handed it to the woman and she looked at it for a solid thirty seconds before smiling and nodding. 
She didn’t bother putting her earphones back on as she began to quickly walk away. 
“So what do we do now?” I asked. 
He stood there for a second and pondered the question. 
“I think we’re going to have to pivot,” he said. 
“You’ll see,” he said before leaving his shopping cart and walking away.

I have been complicit with many great ideas in my life, however, this was far from one of them. 
Gus had a boombox on his car's hood as he was shuffling through a binder full of CDs. 
“So what music does a werewolf enjoy?” I asked sarcastically.
“The music doesn’t matter, what matters is if it’ll be loud enough to draw it towards us,” he said as he flipped another page. 
“Why not put on wolf howls or something?” I asked while pulling a cigarette out. 
“If you heard a group of people talking, would you just walk up towards them?” He asked. 
“Probably not,” I replied. 
“Well the same thing applies for werewolves,” he said. 
He flipped one more page and tapped on a CD. 
“This is our bait,” he said before pulling the CD out of its sleeve and putting it into the boombox. 
“It’s a three song EP so it’s not going to have a lot of variety,” he said. 
“Uh, okay…” I said unsure what reaction he was expecting. 
We were in a field in the middle of nowhere. Just out of county lines so that we wouldn’t be hounded by the police over breaking the curfew that was slowly approaching. 
Gus held the boombox in one hand and a cane in the other. 
“Why do you have a cane?” I asked. 
He scowled at me. 
“Never ask someone why they have a cane, that’s incredibly rude,” he said. 
He walked towards the middle of the field and placed the boombox on the ground. 
The song started softly and pleasantly before turning into an incoherent mess. 
Gus walked back towards me, cane still in hand. 
“What the hell is this?” I asked. 
“Lorna Shore,” he said, making it sound like I was a dumbass for not knowing. 
“You guys really shouldn’t be here,” a voice said from behind us.
I turned around expecting to see a cop but I instead was greeted by a malnourished man who was wearing nothing but a pair of black underwear. 
“You guys really need to leave right now,” he said.
He was shaking violently, his eyes were drowning in fear and a disgusting mop of hair sat atop his hair. 
“I don’t want to hurt you,” he said. 
“Is everything okay?” I asked. 
“I don’t want it to hurt you,” he said with tears forming in his eyes. 
“Get in the car,” Gus said. 
“Yeah, we can get you to the hospital or something,” I said. 
Gus pointed at me. 
“No, you get in the car and start the engine,” he said before handing me his keys. 
I took them and walked to the driver's side. 
Gus began to talk to the man but I couldn’t hear them. 
The man was crying and Gus gave him a hug. 
They began walking towards the boombox. As the sun began to set on the horizon, the man got down on his knees and Gus put his hand on his shoulder. 
They stood like that in silence. 
Gus reached into his trenchcoat and pulled out a pistol. I pressed down on the horn hoping to warn the man but that was to no avail. 
Gus looked at me and a heaviness rested in his eyes. 
I got out of the van and began charging him. 
How could I have been so fucking stupid? This was clearly a mentally disturbed man and I was falling for his delusional worldview. 
“Turn around Conner,” Gus said. 
I leaped into the air and made contact with him. I held him by the waist and dragged him down to the floor. 
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I yelled at him. 
I pinned his arms down to the ground with my knees. 
“You don’t know what you’re doing!” He yelled at me. 
I made a fist and struck him in the nose. 
“I’m not going to let you kill an innocent man!” I yelled before sending another blow to his nose. 
Blood began to gush out of it and Gus was squirming around. If it hadn’t been for his size, I would have been able to keep him pinned to the ground. 
Yet I now found myself off of him. 
“I understand this looks bad, but you have to trust me!” He yelled.
I scrambled upon my feet and began scanning around for the gun. However, it had gotten too dark to find. 
“Trust you? Trust you!” I yelled. 
“You’re going to execute a random fucking dude!” I added. 
I looked over at the man that I had saved and saw him with his mouth wide open. 
Black bile began to flood out of his mouth as his eyes rolled to the back of his head. 
“Oh fuck,” I said. 
“We need to call an ambulance,” I said before reaching into my pocket. 
Gus grabbed his cane and began looking for his gun. 
The man began to shake violently back and forth before landing on his back. He flopped around like a fish out of water. 
Yet even though we had little light, I could see his face was wincing. However, it began to grow outwards. His eyes were closed and he sat on his knees again. He held his face with his hands and I saw that his fingernails had somehow grown at least three inches. 
More black bile came out of his face and onto his chest which was now covered in heavy black hair. His skin was growing more and more grey. 
“Conner,” Gus said, breaking me from the trance that I had been hypnotized into. 
I looked at him and he said one word: 
“Run.”
The man let down his hands and his eyes were wide open. 
Now they were a deep yellow with his iris confronted. 
His face was no longer human, but now that of a wolfs.

  I had never ran so fast in my life. The mix of adrenaline and genuine terror was overflowing in me. My hands trembled as I flung the van door open. I looked up and saw Gus was in the passenger side. I put my hands on the steering wheel and threw the car in reverse. The newly transformed was in our headlights. It got on four legs and began running towards us. Even though we had a good ten second head start, it managed to jump onto the hood of the van. I heard two thuds under us, we had hit the road. I slammed on the breaks and it went flying into the air. It landed on its legs and let out a snarl. 
I spun the steering wheel and gunned it down the road. 
“What the fuck!” I yelled out. 
“What the fuck?!” I yelled while looking at Gus. 
“I said it was werewolf!” He yelled at me.
“I didn’t think it was a real fucking thing!” I yelled. 
“It ripped a guy's head off! What were you thinking it was?” He said gruffly. 
“Did you think it was a metaphorical werewolf? Did you think it was a slang word for something?” He asked oozing sarcasm. 
I glanced at the side mirror and my stomach sank.
I saw a figure running behind us and he was gradually getting closer.
“Did you expect it to be a serial killer who glues hair to his face?” He asked.
“Gus,” I said. 
“There were claw marks all over the place,” he said, continuing his tirade. 
“Gus,” I said, hoping to get his attention. 
“He was a guy in his underwear telling us he didn’t want to hurt us,” he said while ignoring my failed attempt to draw him. 
The werewolf’s face was illuminated by the taillights of the van. 
“Gus!” I yelled. 
“What!” He yelled looking at me, a vein popping in his forehead. 
“He’s right fucking behind us!” I said. 
As the words left my mouth, a thud was heard from the roof of the car.
We fell silent for the first time since we got in the van. 
Gus rolled down his window and looked outside before immediately getting his head back in. 
“There’s a werewolf on the van,” he said. 
“No shit!” I yelled. 
A crunch came from the top of our heads. 
I looked up and saw that the roof of Gus’s van had been punctured by the claws of the beast. 
“What do I do?” I asked. 
Gus was silent.
“What do I do?” I asked with more urgency in my voice. 
“Give me a second, I’m trying to think!” He snapped.
“Take a turn up here!” He said. 
I hooked a right and I could feel the van almost flip. 
“Let’s not do that,” I said. 
“We have to shake him off,” he said urgently. 
To my surprise, the turn we had made was into the humble Walmart parking lot that we had been to. 
I was getting closer and closer to the door when an idea struck me. 
I slammed my foot on the brakes and the tires squealed like a horde of hogs. 
The werewolf flew off the top of the van and crashed through the front doors of the Walmart. 
The glass doors exploded and sent shards of glass flying everywhere.
As soon as he hit the floor he rolled several times and laid down on the ground.
I took a deep and shaking breath. 
“What the fuck,” I weezed out with my hands still glued to the steering wheel.
I looked over at Gus and took another deep breath. 
“What the fuck!” I yelled. 
Gus held up his hand. 
“I understand, you have a lot of emotions going on right now. However, I would like you to please take a deep breath,” he said. 
“Did you just tell me to take a deep breath?” I asked. 
“That is a literal fucking werewolf over there!” I yelled. 
I pointed at the werewolf but when I looked over, I saw that it was gone.
I looked over at where Gus was sitting and he was already running into the Walmart. 
I unbuckled my seat and followed right behind him. 

12
I was only a few feet behind Gus as we charged into the Walmart. The bright fluorescent lights were oppressive with their glare. The tile was slick and Gus held his cane up as he ran. 
Gus froze and looked around for a second before booking looking at me. 
“I need you to get a message over the intercom, we need to evacuate this place immediately,” he said. 
He bent down like he was about to tie his shoes but instead he pulled out a small thing that was hiding behind the fabric of his jeans. 
He handed over to me a pistol that I had only known as a stripper pistol.
“You’ll need this,” he said. 
I grabbed it from and held it in my hand. 
He held my hand and moved it away from him. 
“Have you held a gun before?” He asked with a scowl. 
“No,” I said. 
   He looked like he had a lot to say but he sighed and looked me in the eyes.
“Don’t point guns at people,” he said before he began to run away. 
He was facing me as he ran away. 
“I’ll teach you how to shoot later,” he said before running off into the store. 
I looked at the pistol for a moment and then looked up and began to jog over to the closest cashier I could. 
I saw a red-haired woman standing behind the counter. She was playing on her phone and she had a dead look in her eyes. 
“Ma’am!” I yelled. 
She didn’t look up and I got closer. 
“Ma’am!” I yelled out. 
She glanced up and looked at me for a moment before going back to her phone. 
I stood in front of her and had the pistol clutched in hand. 
“Ma’am! You need to tell everyone to leave, this place isn’t safe,” I said. 
“We are closing soon,” she said, still scrolling on her phone.
“This doesn’t have anything to do with that, there is a werewolf in the store and everyone needs to leave right now,” I said, stressing every word. 
She turned off her phone and looked at me with her head tilted. 
“I have two hours left on my shift, this is only going to keep me here longer,” she said. 
“People are going to die!” I yelled. 
Screams could be heard from the distance as a howl was cried out. 
I looked at her and hoped for any reaction from her. 
She turned on her phone and went back to scrolling. 
I took a deep breath and bit my lip. I didn’t want to do this, but I had to.
I pointed the pistol at the woman and cleared my throat. 
“You’re going to get on that intercom…or else,” I said. 
She looked at the pistol and looked at me with the dead look not leaving her face. 
She moved her head and placed her forehead right against the barrel of the pistol. 
“Honey, I’ve been working here for ten years, death is better than night shift,” she said. 
My hand was trembling and I tried to keep a stoic face. 
“I’ve also been robbed enough times to know that you don’t have the balls to pull that trigger,” she said. 
“You can prove me wrong if you like?” She said with her dry lifeless voice. 
I pointed the gun away from her. 
She got back onto her phone and went back to arranging brightly colored fruits.
“I’ll leave you alone if you-“ before I could finish what I was saying she had the intercom phone in her hand as she dialed away. 
“Attention Walmart shoppers, we are making a request that everyone leaves the store effective immediately. We will not be taking purchases at this moment but we will be happy to help you tomorrow morning,” she said before going back to her phone. 
I began to run away and tried to listen to where the screaming was coming from. It felt surreal to run around Walmart this late at night. 
If it wasn’t a life or death situation, I’d even dare call it fun. 
Gunshots began to ring out from the furthest corners of the store. 
I ran as fast as I could until I slipped and fell on the tile floor. 
I looked to see what I slipped on and I saw my shoes were covered in blood. 
A crimson pool was where I had been running . I got up and saw the blood had made a line that entered into the fitting room. 
I held my pistol in my hand, trying to remember how they would hold it in the movies. 
I slowly walked towards the fitting rooms as I followed the trail of blood. 
The trail ended at a door that was closed. 
I put my ear against it and could hear a heavy breathing coming from within. 
I knocked on the door but got no answer. 
I knocked again and heard a sob come from within. 
“Are you okay in there?” I asked. 
“Go away,” a voice said. 
   “Look, I assume you’re hurt and I want you to know I’m not that…thing,” I said. 
There was a moment of silence before the door opened. 
The same man from earlier who almost fought Gus stood in the doorway. A long laseration went down his arm. 
He took a look at me and a grimace came over his face. 
“Are you fuckers why this shits been happening?” He asked. 
“I need you to trust me right now, it is definitely not because of me,” I said. 
The cut went from his elbow to his shoulder. 
I turned around and grabbed a shirt that had been thrown into a return pile. 
It was a hot pink t-shirt with a unicorn on it that said “Live life magically”. 
I tore it and made a tourniquet out of it. 
“Have you called the police?” I asked. 
“I was about to ask you the same thing,” he replied. 
I pulled out my phone and dialed 9-1-1 before handing it to him. 
“You know this place better than me, you can explain more of where we are,” I said. 
He took the phone and began talking, his words left his mouth like a bullet train. 
I went over to the return section to see if I could find another shirt to tear off and make a bandage. 
I figured this would safest place to stay until help arrived. 
That was until I heard a growling coming from behind me. 
The werewolf was smelling the pool of blood that I had slipped in. 
My brain was no longer capable of thinking, a primal instinct began to override my body. 
I shut the door but stayed out front. 
He didn’t see me. 
I pointed the pistol at him and did what I thought was aiming. 
There was no sights on the pistol and my hand was trembling with a concoction of adrenaline and fear running through me. 
I pulled the trigger and a loud BANG went off. 
There was now a bullet hole in the white tile that was in front of the werewolf. 
It looked at me and blinked for a second before looking at the bullet hole and back to me. I pulled the trigger again but all I heard was clicking. 
I bolted in the opposite direction and ran as fast as my body would allow for me to go. 
Yet I heard it right behind me. I couldn’t afford to look behind but I knew he was getting closer and closer. 
“GUS!” I yelled out. 
“GUS!” I yelled out again. 
I didn’t hear anything except the running of the feet and the sound of corporate friendly pop music playing over the PA system. 
I ran passed section after section, trying to find anyway to get the beast off my tail. 
Yet I felt him getting closer.
I swear I could feel its breath on my neck.
My knee buckled and I fell to the ground once more. 
I turned around and tried to get up but it was too late. 
It was now on top of me smelling me. 
There was not an ounce of humanity left in him. His skin was a sickly grey and a long brown fur covered him. 
I cursed Hailey in that moment, if she hadn’t called out last second, I wouldn’t be here. 
Granted, what was even the point in trying to fight back? I wasn’t going to win and it’s not like life was going to get better for me. 
I was only going to delay the inevitable.
I closed my eyes and braced for the end. 
Until a slew of gun shots rang out like the sound Gabriel’s trumpet. 
I looked and saw Gus coming at me from the side. 
“Did you really think we were done fighting wolf face?” He yelled before firing off three more shots. 
I watched as the bullets made impact with its flesh. Tearing into one side but not leaving the other. 
It got up and began to charge Gus who in turn let out two more shots and began to run away. 
I got off the ground and began to follow the two. 
I looked for anything I could use to arm myself and the best thing I saw was in the beer section. 
I grabbed a forty and smashed it against the floor. Beer and glass went everywhere and grabbed the neck of the bottle and followed the gunshots. 
My makeshift weapon was in my left hand as I ran into combat. I saw Gus swapping his magazines and firing a few more shots at the werewolf but it only barely slowed him down. I ran up behind the werewolf and crammed the broken bottle into his back. It howled and it dawned on me that much like the pistol, this was a one shot weapon and I had nothing else planned. 
I ran towards Gus and was right behind him with the werewolf on my tail for the fourth time that night. 
“What do we do?” I hollered towards him. 
“I have only a few shots left and it doesn’t seem to be effective,” he yelled at me. 
We ran through more of the Walmart, a kaleidoscope of different colored chips were in the corner of my eye. 
Gus stopped running and I turned my head to see what he was doing. 
Shells went flying into the after each trigger pull, and the werewolf was stunned. 
Gus held his cane in both hands. 
I was about to see a man die tonight and I was going to follow suit. 
I owed it to see his final stand, his final huzzah. 
The werewolf shook its head and began to run towards Gus before jumping into the air. 
As he was in the air Gus pulled the top of his cane and a sword came out. In the same motion he dodged the werewolf mid air and pierced its flesh as it was flying over him. 
The werewolf hit the ground and while it was laying on the floor Gus pulled out the blade and dove it into the chest of the beast. 
A blood curdling howl was let out before it moaned and groaned. 
Slowly the werewolf began to look more like a human again. 
Its fur and claws retracted and its skin returned to a lifeless pale complexion.
Gus held him in his arms.
“I’m sorry,” the bleeding man said with tears in his eyes. 
“It’s okay,” Gus said.
“I didn’t want to hurt anyone,” the bleeding man said. 
Gus held the man’s shoulder. 
“I know, but it’s over. You can sleep now,” Gus said.
“I’m so sorry,” the bleeding man said. 
“It’s okay, you don’t have to worry anymore,” Gus said.
The man said nothing more but he held such sorrow. 
Silence bestowed us as his eyes closed on last time. 


13
It’s rather impressive what situations you can get out of with a surveillance system and a police force willing to perform a cover up. 
I don’t really recall much of what happened afterwards. As Gus was holding the bleeding man, a police officer charged me from behind and I hit my head against the tile. 
Everything went black or so I’ve assumed. 
The moment my memory comes together is when I was on my phone with my editor. 
I told everything that happened and he didn’t believe me. I sent some photos and a rough draft of the story that was going to be run. 
He said it was something that was definitely going to sell. 
I asked if I could stay down south for a little longer, I told him I found a source that could easily get us some top stories. 
We argued for a little bit but he said I could stay as long as I was on my own dime. 
It worked for me since this was definitely a better situation than what I had up north.
I left my motel room and walked to the van. 
“What do we have next?” I asked. 
Gus smiled and unlocked the vans doors. 
“Ever seen a ghost before?” He asked.

1nj2q45,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioLandlord/comments/1nj2q45/looking_for_help_navigating_eviction_notice/,Looking for help navigating eviction notice without a hearing,"Hello everyone, 

I would like to ask how to navigate an eviction notice that has been decided without a hearing. 

My brother and I rented out a 3 bedroom apartment for $3324 per month. We moved into in June 2024, along with my elderly parents. Late last year in December my brother was injured at work and ended up being off for almost 3 months. I was covering as much of the rent and bills and car payments as I could but ultimately, we fell behind by 2 months. If you ever fell being in rent, you know it adds up quickly. By July we were a little under $9k in arrears. 

We got the hearing notice in March and had our hearing with the LTB on May 2025. By the time of the hearing, we had paid off half of the amount left of the arrears. 

During the hearing, the landlord rejected the mediation request and stated that they want to move forward with the eviction process anyways. They presented their case to the judge and the judge asked what our plan was to pay off the arrears. We told the judge that we wanted to pay $5000 in rent every month divided into 2 payment (one payment at the beginning of the month and one payment on or before the 17th of the month). However the landlord did not agree to those terms and so the judge said he would deliberate and give us a decision in a few days. 

We got the mail that the judge agreed to our terms to pay 2 payments. And the date for the start of this agreement was listed as July 1, 2025. Since July we have been paying off our arrears and rent on time. That was until September 1st 2025. Due to Labour Day, our pay days (my brother gets paid bimonthly) and the bank being closed for the holidays, we ended up paying $2500 on September 3rd instead of the 1st. This ended up violating the terms of the agreement with the landlord and LTB and today I recieved a letter stating that I am vacate the apartment by September 23rd. 

I am so stressed out. This is the last month of paying off the arrears too. After this month we would have been back to normal. What are my options and what can I do. I know the landlord wants me out, and they have started this multiple times through their property manager who has told me to just move out and go somewhere else. But 2 weeks isn’t enough time to find a new place and move out. 

I know they want me out long before we had gone into arrears. The property manager has also been giving me a hard time since February. They did not tell me that my rent had increased in May 2025 to $3407. They also tried to have my car towed away when I was off loading my groceries. Her husband has been rude to my guests and has tried to have thier cars tagged, even when we paid for parking. Someone dropped coffee in the stairwell and we reported it to have it cleaned, and they told me to clean it myself since I probably dropped the coffee there. We are people of colour and another couple yelled racial slurs at my brother. My brother chose to ignore it and the property manager came to our house to tell us not to instigate people. 

I’m just so sick of this place but I don’t know where to go and in such short notice. What are my options? ",2,1758080656.0,OntarioLandlord,2,1.0,False

In this job I serve food, take orders, make coffees and other similar jobs all day and its quite a high pressure environment. 

My sleep schedule has completely changed, as I now have to wake up at 4:30am to be able to get in for 7:30am, and I am asleep by 9pm at the latest. However, I am now starting to wake up in the night round 2-3 am totally panicking because I think I have to make someone a coffee. I usually sleep with no clothes on aswell, so this adds to the panic. 

I just don't know what to do? It's really not nice waking up having these almost hallucinations that people are here for coffees, but i'm not sure what I can do to stop it. 

TLDR: Just started a new job, keep waking up 2-3 am panicking thinking people are here in my house for me to make them drinks ",1,1758080626.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

Today, I noticed the water from the shower screen was not coming out evenly and it was pouring out in an awkward and uneven pattern. I have done the following:

1. Backflushed the machine using cafiza and the Weber Spring Clean - this is my first time since I purchased and I realize I should likely do this weekly. However, the backflush did not emit any dirty coffee water as it was primarily clean detergent water in the tray. 

2. Removed the shower screen - upon inspection it was very clean; practically new. Since I use a puck screen there were no visible coffee grounds or residue. I rinsed and wiped with a microfiber to be certain. 

3. Refilled the water tank - it was on the lower end so I refilled for good measure. 

Any other tips on what could be causing the water to not dispense evenly through the shower screen? For additional background, this is my first espresso machine so I am still learning. 

For any potential buyers - I love this machine and highly recommend (note: I have nothing to compare it to)

1nj2m6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1nj2m6y/the_beast_of_wayfeild_part_1/,The Beast of Wayfeild part 1,"1 I stared out at the city skyline, a can of cheap beer in one band and a cigarette in the other. The sun was starting to set and for the first time in awhile, I felt like I could breathe. I still had no clue what I was going to do, my life at that moment was a train wreck but I felt that the fire had died down. Even if only for a breath. I had no place to stay anymore and I wasn’t sure if I could ever trust anyone again. A stream of smoke blew out of my mouth; the melody of the city was a barrage of angry horn honking that would go on long into the night. My phone rang and I looked down to see who it was. “Editor Murphy,” the screen read. I answered the phone and took a sip of beer. “Hello, boss,” I asked. “Hey, West, I know this is the last second but would you be willing to come to the office?” He asked. My stomach sank, with the way everything was going, I wouldn’t be surprised if I got fired at this point. “Is everything okay?” I asked. “Oh yeah, it’s just I have an assignment that Hailey had to drop out of. It’s a pretty big assignment and I figured it might be more up your alley anyway,” he said. I took a sip of beer. “When do you need me in the office?” I asked. “Come by first thing in the morning and we’ll talk,” he said. “Well that sounds good to me,” I said before hanging up on the phone.

“Virginia?” I asked. Mr. Murphy took a sip of his black coffee. “I know it’s a bit of a way away, but the company is willing to pay for your travel expenses,” he said. The dying light bulb in his office continued to flicker. Throughout my entire time working here, his lights were always like that. I looked at the smoke-stained wallpaper of his office. “What does the assignment entail?” I asked. Mr. Murphy took another swig of black coffee and moved his seat closer to his desk. “There is a town called Wayfield and they’ve had a series of grisly murders occur,” he said. “I’ve seen some of the leaked photos online, and they are truly grotesque. I about damn near vomited when I first saw them,” he said. “So like, do you want me to solve it or something?” I asked. “It would be amazing if you did, but no, I just want you to go down and interview some of the people in the area. It’s a small town, and everyone seems to know everyone. It’ll be a juicy story,” he said. I sat in silence for a moment, running through every situation in my head. “What time do I leave?” I asked. Mr. Murphy let out a smile.

I drove for five hours, and everything I still owned was packed in the duffle bag I had been using as a suitcase since high school. I pulled up to the smallest motel I had ever seen. It was painted a gross off-white color and had a giant neon sign in the front. When I say it was small, I don't think this place had more than six rooms on the entire property. I got out of my car and looked at the sludge-filled, man-made swamp that was likely once a pool, and I walked into the lobby. It was small and smelled like a cheap cleaning solution. I walked up to the front desk, where a long-haired guy was reading a magazine. I stood in front of the desk for a second or two, waiting for him to acknowledge me. Yet my attempt at subtlety was in vain. “Hello,” I said. He glared at me and put his magazine to the side. “How can I help you?” he asked. “I’m here to check in. The Midnight Press booked a room for me. It should be under Conner West,” I said. He tapped away at a computer that was on the desk and clicked his mouse a few times. “Yeah, so, like your room isn’t ready yet,” he said in the most disinterested voice I had ever heard. I wanted to be sarcastic, I wanted to ask why the hell it wasn’t ready yet. It wasn’t like this was a big luxury hotel, my car is the only one in the parking lot for fucks sake. I took a deep breath, I couldn’t burn any bridges yet. “Do you know when it should be ready?” I asked. The man shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know, maybe like an hour or something?” he said. I inhaled deeply and tried to hide my frustration. “Okay, I am kind of hungry so I’ll go grab a bite to eat and I’ll be right back,” I said. “Okay,” he said before going back to his magazine. I walked out the door of the lobby and sat on a bench they had out front. I pulled out the pack of cigarettes that I had been puffing on since I started driving down this way. I lit the third to last one up and I started smoking. I felt the summer wind blowing on my face, the sun was starting to set and I was starting to understand the appeal of a small town. I didn’t hear the barrage of horns and yelling; I listened to a welcoming silence. The sound of cicadas hummed in the distance and I heard a wolf let out a howl. I looked over across the street and I saw a place that just called itself “The Diner”. I figured I still had time to kill, and eating something that wasn’t potato chips and energy drinks might do me some good. I put my cigarette butt in the ashtray, and I started walking over.
The smell of bacon and burnt toast greeted me as I walked in. It was around eight o'clock on a Tuesday night and it was about as dead as you expected. I walked up to the counter and took a seat on a barstool. I looked at the sticky laminated menu that was already there. I don’t think this thing has been updated since the 2000s. A woman walked up to me with a small notebook in hand. “Know what you want hun?” She asked. “I’ll just have a burger and fries with a chocolate shake,” I answered. She scribbled on her paper. “It’ll be out in just a moment,” she said. She left and my eyes began to wander around the diner. Black and white tiles covered the floors and the booths all had a fake red leather. There was a jukebox in the corner of the room that had an “Out of order” sign on it. I looked next to it and the only other patron in the restaurant was sitting in a booth in the far corner. From where I sat I could already see the trench coat and stained Final Fantasy t-shirt. “I got an hour,” I said to myself before getting up and walking over to him. He was a man that could be described as husky. He had a beard that was kept way cleaner than his greasy hair that was wild and unkempt. He had a black fedora sitting next to him on the table. “Hey I don’t mean to bother you sir,” I said. The man looked up from his meal, which was three grilled cheese sandwiches and a plate of bacon. “But I’m a reporter from out of town, would you be willing to participate in an interview?” I added. The man finished chewing and took a sip of his drink. “Sure, I could use the company!” He said joyfully. I sat down in front of him. “I take it you’re here for the murders?” He asked before taking a massive bite out of his grilled cheese. “Yes actually,” I replied. “How did you know?” I said. He took a moment to respond while taking a sip from his straw. “There’s not really a whole heck of a lot that happens around these parts. The police have tried to keep things quiet but that went out the door almost immediately,” he said. I pulled out my phone and started taking notes. “So, did you know any of the victims?” I asked. “No sir I did not,” he said. “I’m actually from out of town,” he said before taking a bite of a piece of bacon. My face grew puzzled and I tiled my head. “Oh, so what brings you to town then?” I asked. He ate another bite of bacon. “The murders,” he said.

——-4

The waitress brought over my food around the same time the man finished his second grilled cheese. “So are you an investigator, journalist, or…” I said very confused. “No, I’m here for an alternative reason,” he said. “Dark tourism?” I asked. “What?” He said with a face as confused as mine. “Dark tourism, it’s when people go to check out really dark and disturbing things for a vacation,” I answered. He shook his head before taking a sip. “No, I’m here because someone hired me,” he said. “So, you are an investigator?” I asked. “No,” he said before reaching into his pocket. He pulled out a business card and handed it to me. In big white letters on a black card it read: “Discount Vampire Hunter” and under that in smaller letters was the name Gus VonHammer and his phone number next to that. I was starting to think I was being fucked with. “Well Mr. VonHammer, do you think it’s a vampire doing all of this?” I asked, trying to hold back every ounce of sarcasm in my voice. He let out a chuckle and shook his head. “No no no, it’s obviously not a vampire,” he said. My eyebrow raised as I took a bite of my burger. “It’s a werewolf,” he said. I snorted right in front of him. “Is something funny?” He asked. “A werewolf?” I said. “Yes, a werewolf,” he said with the seriousness of a doctor telling his patient the tests came back positive. “That doesn’t make sense, there’s been a string of murders and it’s not even a full moon,” I said, deciding to play along with the delusions this man was clearly encapsulated in. “Only European werewolves do a monthly transformation,” he said. I took a bite of my fries. “Oh really?” I asked while wondered if this was how Art Bell felt every time he was on air. “Yes, North American werewolves transform nightly and are typically drifters in the day time,” he said. “Wow, I never knew that,” I said. “The thing is, they mostly go after cattle, deer, and other similar animals. It’s rather unusual that they go after humans,” he explained. “So, when you find this werewolf, are you going to shoot it with a silver bullet?” I asked. “Kind of,” he said. “Kind of?” I asked. “I’m going to shoot it with a hollow point forty-five and then while it’s down I’m going to cover it with gasoline and burn the body,” he said. I was happy to see that even small towns had crazy people. However, I was deeply disturbed by the fact that this man might kill a random person and claim he was a werewolf. I finished my milkshake and asked for a check. “Keep my business card,” he said. “If you see anything out of the ordinary just let me know,” he said. I smiled and nodded my head as I placed a twenty-dollar bill on the table. “You bet buddy,” I said, trying to leave as soon as possible. I left the diner and started walking over to the motel. If my room wasn’t ready it was going to take a lot to not throw a fit. I marched over and thought about what type of life Mr. VonHammer lived. He couldn’t have had a lot of family or friends close to him, because who the hell would let someone live in such delusion? As I was walking towards the motel lobby, something felt off. I shrugged it off as being creeped out by the guy I just spent the last hour talking to. When I got to the front door, it was broken off of its hinges. I walked past the broken door and my heart dropped. Blood was splattered all over the lobby. Viscera and bone fragments littered the linoleum floor like daisies in a meadow. What was left of the front desk clerk's head was sitting on the desk, his magazine soaking in blood. Torn limbs were scattered and a broken window led out to the night. A scream erupted out of me and I bolted out.

——5 The blanket sat on my shoulders and a cup of coffee was in my hands. “I really wish you got introduced to our town in a better way,” Sheriff O’Neil said. I said nothing as the shock was still processing itself out of my system. “We have a peanut festival in March, it’s a really big thing…well big for us,” he said. The flashing lights of the ambulance coated us, the sirens had been cut once they got into the parking lot. “It’s a shame really, he was a good kid,” the Sheriff said. “Do you need me to give a statement?” I mustered up. He stood awkwardly for a second and scratched his face. “Look, this ain’t really a big town, we know you had no involvement in any of this,” he said. Even in my recovering state of shock, alarm bells began to go off in my head. “What?” I asked. The sheriff took his glasses off and leaned in towards me. “Look, it was probably a suicide, the guy was miserable and this just looked like a suicide,” he said. “He was fucking decapitated and dismembered,” I said. “Watch your tone boy,” the sheriff said. “Watch my tone? Watch my fucking tone?” I asked. “Unless that guy threw himself in a wood chipper, I don’t see that being a suicide,” I said. “Watch your tone with me boy,” he said as his hand was slowly moving towards his pistol. I took a deep sigh. “Is there a place I can stay for the night?” I asked about choosing my life over questions. ”We contacted Gary; he should be here in a few minutes,” he said. I took a sip of my coffee and nodded my head. The sheriff no longer had his hand on his pistol. “Has this happened before?” I asked. “I can't disclose that information,” he said. A deputy came up to the sheriff with a worried look on his face. “Sir, I need to talk to you,” he said. Sheriff O’Neil gave a thumbs up and looked at me. “I’ll be back in a few minutes,” the Sheriff said to me. He walked away and I sat in silence as I sipped my coffee. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the business card I had received. “Was he right?” I thought to myself. The officer's speed walked past me, the sheriff pointed at me. “Stay out of trouble,” he said to me. The two got into a cop car and turned the sirens on immediately. Before I could blink they darted into the night.

Gary was the owner of the town motel. Although he tried to maintain as much of a professional presence as possible, he was clearly disturbed by everything that had transpired. “I can assure you, this isn’t a normal situation here,” he said. He was a short fat Italian man who was balding at the top of his head. “I do apologize that your stay this far has been delayed,” he said. “I understand, things happen,” I said. “That’s true…that’s mostly true,” he said as he pulled out the keys to my room. “I’ll go ahead and comp this room for you and tell you what, you can have anything you want in the mini fridge,” he said to me. I held my duffle bag around my shoulder and walked inside the room. It was a rather unremarkable place, a tv that looked straight out of the 90s sat on a dresser that looked straight out of the 70s. The walls were covered with a wallpaper that had a variety of flowers on it and a painting of the ocean rested above the single bed. “Am I allowed to ask you a question?” I asked. “Of course sir!” Gary said with a slight head nod. “The kid who worked at the front desk, were you close to him?” I asked. He stood stiffly and rubbed his head. “I mean, we were about as close as a front desk worker and his manager could be. I didn’t really know him personally,” he said. “Okay, that’s fair,” I said before putting my bag on the bed. “Do you know if he was dealing with any mental health issues?” I asked. “Well, you’re a rather interesting character,” Gary said with a confused face. “So I’ve heard,” I responded. “I don’t really think I’m allowed to give out information like that,” he said. I raised my hands up and shook my head. “And I fully respect that,” I said. I bit my lip for a moment and lowered my hands. “It’s just the police are saying that, he passed because of a suicide,” I said. Gary took a deep breath as a look of grimace overwhelmed his face. “Sir, it’s late and I’m sorry for the inconvenience that this night has caused you. I will not be answering any questions regarding my employees mental wellbeing. I wish you a good evening and a pleasant stay,” he said before handing me over the hotel key and walking off into the night.

What they never tell you about seeing a graphic crime scene, is you can’t stop thinking about it. The T.V was tuned to something stupid as the scene of the lobby played in my head on repeat. I looked at the alarm clock and saw it was after two. I got out of bed and walked to the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face and looked at the heavy bags that were under my eyes. I walked to the mini fridge and looked at the inside. I grabbed two airplane bottles of Jack and a can of Coke. The night wasn’t going to go any faster if I was buzzed or sober. The cracks of the airplane bottles made me salivate as I poured my drink. I opened the curtains and sat in the chair that was right next to the window. The horror dawned on me that I very well might have been the last person that kid interacted with. Thoughts began to run through my head, speculations of a person I had only interacted with for less than five minutes. Then I saw a flashlight walking towards the lobby. I closed the curtains and put my shoes on. I looked for anything to arm myself with, the best I could do was a lighter and a can of complimentary hairspray. I peaked out the window and saw that the flashlight was now inside the lobby. Either the purest ambition of journalistic integrity overcame me, or the stupidest impulse override my senses, but either way, I was outside and walking towards the lobby. I was crouching in the parking lot, trying to make myself as small as possible. I got to the window of the lobby and I peered through. A figure was looking at the crime scene, they were hunched over a bloodstain and were taking a photo of the things around them. I slowly began to start walking away and towards my room. The game plan was still developing in my head. I was going to lock myself in my room and call the police. If anyone who wasn’t a cop came by, I was going to use my crude flamethrower to distract them as I ran to my car. “A bit late for a stroll isn’t it?” A voice said from behind me. I turned around and held the lighter and hairspray up. “I don’t want any trouble,” I said with a quiver of fear in my voice. I could only see the silhouette of the figure standing in front of me. The bright light of the street lamp radiated a dim gross orange. “I never assumed you did,” he said as he got closer. “It’s nice to see you again, I will say I wish it was under better conditions,” the silhouette said. “Who are you?” I asked. “Well, you should still have my business card,” he said before stepping close enough to where I could see his face. “Why the hell are you here?” I asked. He let out a chuckle. “Simple, I’m being paid to investigate and kill the werewolf that’s in town and this was the second most recent werewolf attack,” Gus VonHammer said. “Are you still going on about this werewolf shit?” I asked. “Also what the fuck do you mean second most recent?” I added. “What do you suppose it was then? A gust of wind?” Gus said sarcastically. I was baffled by such a statement. “What? No this has to be a serial killer or something,” I said. He nodded his head in silence for a second. “So, a person broke down the doors of a motel lobby and violently dismembered one of its employees before jumping through the window and then went to the local baptist church where they did the exact same crime to two teenagers who were in a car together?” He asked with a smug look on his face. “W…what,” was all I was able to muster up. “Listen, I know it’s hard to believe, I know it sounds batshit insane. However, you have to believe me when I say that a werewolf is on the loose,” he explained. There was a silence that lingered between us. “I need a fucking cigarette,“ I said.",1,1758080334.0,CreepCast_Submissions,2,1.0,False

I’m looking to upgrade our keurig to an espresso machine but my wife also likes to have drip coffee.

Is there a solid combo machine out there (happy to spend $600 or a bit more) or do I just resign myself to less counter space and have 2 machines, one for drip one for espresso?

1nj2jr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nj2jr8/may_have_dug_myself_a_hole/,May have dug myself a hole,"I'll be as brief as i can. I'm currently talking to 4 women. A, E, M and G. All via dating app  
A: Matched back in April, replies once a week at best (busy woman) and asked her out in May. My schedule changed and its been ages since she agreed. Our schedules do not line up and she books out things well in advance. Haven't seen her yet. Had another woman similar to her, J, but she has since started ignoring me as of 3 weeks ago so shes not included here but A still seems interested in a coffee. Lives a decent distance away as well (few hours)

E: Talking for a little over a month, gone out twice, only hugged. Mad friend vibes; but im wondering if thats just her guard being up as she's made it clear that any sort of advances would not be tolerated. Now, i know consent is a thing, but its very difficult to find attraction with a large dental bill staring you in the face (shes combat trained, which is fine but constantly bringing it up is a bit of a moodkiller). Considering one last date to see if things change, if not, i'm probably going to cut this one loose because im just not feeling it. I feel like 1-2 dates is a little too short to get a good gauge on who someone is, but the sparks just arent there right now.

M: Old acquaintance from about 8 years ago. Never did anything/spoke much. Appeared out the blue; seem to get on well and things have quickly turned from innocent 'probing' questions to hot heavy and flirty with the heavy implication that things will probably happen should we go out. Trying to think with my brain here and not just be lustful. No dates yet.

G: The front runner, She actually asked ME out (very flattering btw) and we've gone out twice with a third coming up next week. She's funny, she's a lot like me on so many levels and she said that she wanted to shoot her shot ""before she missed out"". I really, really like this one. She says shes after long term on her profile but when i asked her she was much more casual about the whole thing. The only bad thing about her so far is that she sucks with texting/calling by her own admission. much better in person. So communication is a hurdle

They all are opposed to kids except G; but i don't know her timeline for them yet. Im not opposed to kids; just not right now with how everything is.

Now here's the kicker: Every single dating app pursuit since february tends to fail in 1-2 dates (not many; say,  8 total women). Only one made it to the third. I have not slept with any of them or any previous ones (though the opportunity was right there). I don't feel right about seeing M, sleeping with her, then pursuing G seriously right after. Also if I saw G first, slept with her, then slept with M, i also wouldn't feel right about it. I was raised pretty old school so intimacy carries a lot of weight to me (plus whoever it is will only be my 2nd partner ever). The only reason i'm talking to multiple is because when i focus on 1 person, it breaks down no matter how well aligned we are on things. It just so happens that this time, they have not bailed early. This would be a lot easier without M in the picture but i'm battling self control on that one.

1nj2ere,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nj2ere/mr_morrigan/,Mr. Morrigan,"Red drips from beneath the blade he holds to his skin. Cursing briefly, his hand flinches away from his face. He drops the razor into the dirty sink and twists the tap. Irritation flares up in his chest as he watches it flow down into the drain, the fresh cut stings further as he waits.

Gray-ish water mixes with the red, and the man realizes just how much he was bleeding. Looking up into the mirror revealed how a perfect crimson streamed down from his upper lip and down his chin. He feels morbid enough to reach up and smear the color across his lips and admire it, and then he’s quickly splashing away the unconscious action.

Wondering what got ahold of him, Mr. Morrigan brings a towel to his face to pat away the moisture. Quickly, he presses his fingers to the cut to keep it from dripping further. Shuffling around in the drawer under the sink with his other hand, he still watches himself in the mirror as if the man in it might do something else out of pocket.

Just his luck, his hand catches on something sharp, and a jagged line of red is now sliced into his palm. He kicks the bottom edge of the cabinet in a sort of rage. Prying his eyes away from the mirror, he quickly finds the bandages he’d been hunting for. Snatching the accursed things out of the drawer, he tears them open.

The clicking clacking noises of a small, trotting creature comes close enough that his ears make him turn his attention to it. His own pet comes up to him gingerly, nuzzling at his fist with her cold, wet nose until finally he turned his hand toward her.

She licked at the red that had begun to leak slowly out from his newest slash with an almost uncharacteristic fever. His temper goes down faintly into nothing more than a dull pang that synchronized with each twinge of his wounds.

When he finally does rush out of his house, he’s struggling into his overcoat— which he usually wears for work— with a scabbed-over lip and a bandaid that makes great attempts to peel off of his palm.

Out of habit, or out of paranoia, Mr. Morrigan keeps his car parked out back, behind his house. It’s great in embarrassing instances such as this when he’s jumbled in the early morning. Nobody can see him struggle back here, guarded by tall trees and shadow.

However, it also has a downside. The forest behind his house is dark, and each dark morning he wonders fantastically about what gory, dripping creatures lurk in it. What things might watch from the dankness of the dirt?

He never really stares in between the trees for too long, lest he scare himself with his own imagination.

As he finally pulls on his coat, his fingers run over the hairs that stand straight up at the back of his neck. He’s feeling particularly in his head today, likely as a result of the stressful events of his morning. He tries to write his irrational fear off as such, letting his eyebrows furrow until finally he can’t take it anymore, and he leans on his palms against the door of his car. His head aches as he fumbles for the handle, all but throwing himself inside the perceived safety of the vehicle.

Taking a deep breath at the hum beneath his hands when he starts his beat-up car, Mr. Morrigan attempts composure. *There’ s nothing in those woods*, he tells himself, *you’re just being ridiculous. You didn’ t get enough sleep. You’re under stress. You’re late for work!*

A familiar, burning feeling flares angrily in his chest again. Practically slamming the gear shift forward, the man pulls away from the dark woods and the back of his house. Poking the front of his car out of the driveway just enough to perceive the surrounding roadway, inching out onto the asphalt with more speed than he should.

Mr. Morrigan quite enjoys his job. Being the person people will look to as a sort of heroor bringer of justice is gratifying. Normally he would be humming whatever song was on the radio, ready for the day, but instead he gripped tightly onto the steering wheel in silence.

He finds it fascinating, too, the occupation. It’s not just the pay or the praise that make him eager to do as he does. It's the mystery, the puzzles to put together… *The blood*.

Mr. Morrigan swerves at the intrusive thought. If anything, the gory scenes are the worst part of his job as a detective for the local police department. He’s one of the first on every scene, and it's his job to see *everything* as it was, before the clean-up crew even touches a hair on the victim’s head.

Sure, he may be a little desensitized by it at this point, but it’s not something he should ever— *could* ever— *enjoy*. He clenches his jaw. *What’ s wrong with him?*

A dog— much like his own, but dirty and grungy with the wear of outside life— trots in front of his car, stopping in the middle of the road to sniff at the ground. He recognizes the mangey thing, a locally favorite stray that never really gets close enough to anybody who might snatch it.

People drive below the speed limit around here for that dog, not wanting to hit it out of either peer pressure or personal affection. But Mr. Morrigan has to get to work, and his face burns and his patience is worn thin, and he doesn’t particularly *care* that the mutt is not something to run his tires over.

The sound of it hitting and crunching against the vehicle makes him cringe only slightly, but he flees from the scene as fast as he’d committed it.

He arrives at the station as he usually does, accepting an already-prepared coffee and casefile. Looking at pictures of the bloody scene doesn’t make his stomach churn even a bit this morning, and he takes the fact as a way to lessen hindrance rather than as something to be worried of. As quick as he’d gotten here, he had to leave again.

The place of the crime, he used to know well. A warehouse, now old and unused, was the place of his first job out of highschool. It was never in the best shape, even when it was up and running, but today it looks even worse.

The air tastes like blood, now, in this old warehouse with red-brown stains encrusted on the floors and up the walls in places. Mr. Morrigan can take a good guess that those stains aren’t all from industry— and especially not the freshly crimson ones which splatter the walls and pool on the floor next to a distended corpse.

He listens to cameras as they flash and shutter around the space, particularly focused around the obvious. Glancing around with some sort of wonder, the detective inspects the space around and within the scene.

He looks for places where there is likely to be fingerprints, some sort of DNA residue, a murder weapon, all of the standard things that could be found on-scene.

When he finds the most conspicuous, most obvious bloody fingerprint on the wall, he comes to a sort of realization. It almost makes him angry, how dumb these criminals are, how easy it is to catch most of them, how easy it is to place them at the scene.

He realizes he could do this so much better. He could never get caught. He could do it, just like how he’d wiggled the tires as he ran over that stray so that his tire tracks wouldn’t be imprinted in the corpse in a way that would be distinguishable. He could do something bad, knowing the telltale signs that would connect him to it, and be able to avoid ever even being suspected.

Mr. Morrigan calls the forensics team over for examination, watching with emotionless, flickering eyes.

His cellar is dusty, he thinks as he sweeps his hand over the wall to find the switch for the light, dirt and dust floating off the walls and into his respiratory. He never likes to stay in it so long as to dust it. He doesn’t come down here much, just sometimes to gather tools that he hardly uses.

He believes that even if there is a storm, he could never stay in here long enough to weather it. He’d rather be swept up in a dangerous wind than lost in his own thoughts down in the cold, mildewed pit.

He swears he can hear something’s claws scurrying across the floor every time he flicks on the stubborn, rusted switch. He shakes it off, grabs his needed supplies as quickly as he can and leaves.

When he emerges into his backyard again, he pauses in front of the treeline. He holds up the tools in his hands for nobody in particular to see. The glimmer of a sharp spade and a long, weathered pitchfork seem to bring out a shuffling in the woods.

“Are these good?” He mutters to the wind and the trees.

Something crawling, dragging across the mud registers in his ears, and as quick as he can he turns away. There's no time to talk to imaginary creatures, no time to meet the eyes of whatever demon has possessed him.

He must test his theory

He’s invited to a lovely dinner at his neighbor’s house tonight, and he’s dressedaccordingly, enough layers to obscure the suspiciously heavy weight in his pocket. He reminds himself to find better suited tools later. Regardless, he is welcomed in and sat down with no second glances.

He is a nice man— Mr. Dubois— and his wife is lovely, though aged. She sits down as Mr. Dubois pulls out the food, setting it into the middle of their three plates. The room is well lit, warm-colored and decorated nicely.

“We’d just like to tell you thank you for completing my brother’s case,” says Mrs. Dubois, “Thanks to your work, he now can rest in peace, and what happened to him won’t happen to anybody else.” She smiles at Mr. Morrigan and raises her glass.

Mr. Morrigan smiles back, and as the woman’s husband settles down at the table, they all clink cups. “It’s just what I do ma’am, but thank you very much. How are you handling yourselves?” He says politely.

The couple joins hands atop the tablecloth. Mr. Morrigan finds a sudden spark of annoyance at the very visible display of affection, but continues his amiable demeanor. “We are doing alright, Morrigan. The funeral for my dear brother is next weekend, and you would be free to come, if you’re able,” the woman slid her hand away in order to grab her utensils and begin eating.

“Thank you very much, I’ll hope to be unbusy.” Mr. Morrigan responds casually, though having little intention to join the ceremony.

They all begin to eat, but Mr. Morrigan’s hands twitch with the opportunity he instead has sitting across from him. He’s unsure how to start. It should be easy to take out the older woman, as he knows she’s had multiple health problems through the years, but Mr. Dubois himself is rather healthy himself, though not particularly bright.

*What a hard decision…* Mr. Morrigan turns this over in his mind, flicking the end of the fork handle with his fingernail.

“I think I’ll excuse myself,” Mrs. Dubois interrupts, standing from the table and smoothing out her shirt. When she disappears, Mr. Dubois is leaning toward the man who’d just gotten snapped out of his thoughts.

“She doesn’t eat much, anymore, since he’s died,” He confides quietly. “I’m worried… But she denies the change happened.” The concerned man shook his head, glancing down at his plate as if he, too, would like to leave it there.

Mr. Morrigan grits his teeth. “You might go talk to her, if you should.” He lets a hand rest encouragingly upon the husband’s shoulder.

“Perhaps you’re right,” Mr. Dubois nodded numbly and stood, leaving the dining room with only Mr. Morrigan and three unfinished plates of food.

*Poison*, he curses himself, he should’ve brought poison! Tossing his fork down onto the place mat, he himself stood from the table.

He would like to chalk it up to his plans being ruined, but if he’d actually admit it, he was rather afraid of going through with them. He would not like to admit this as a *chickening out*. He tells himself he’ll try some other time as he grabs his coat.

“Dinner was delicious, thank you!” He calls, placing his hand on the knob. “Have a wonderful night,” he twists his wrist, slipping through the door with the spade weighing even heavier in his pocket. *What a waste of an afternoon.*

Just before he shuts the front door, though, something small comes flying out of the crack of it. The furry thing nearly trips him on the step, and then Mr. Morrigan is very mad.

His hands hum with the force of it, and just as soon as he’s recovered from his near-fall,he whips the spade out of his pocket and lashes out with the newly-sharpened blade. It catches, unexpectedly, although delightfully, on the animal’s throat. Mr. Morrigan takes no time in snatching up the foul beast and hiding its body against his own on the inside of his coat.

He hurries home, hoping none of the neighborhood saw the split second when his composure let up.

Not really knowing what to do, Mr. Morrison hurries into his backyard, where nobody can see as he drops the poor cat to the ground with the harsh clang of the bloody tool that caused this. Frowning at the mess, he goes over to kick open the door to his cellar. Shuddering at the sight of the gradually darkening staircase, the man grabbed the limp creature by the tail, opting to just toss it down rather than go in.

The bleeding lump thumps and rolls down until it falls between the space between the bottommost two stairs. Everything is quiet except for the woods that whistle behind him. He turns to the trees, frowning at the bloodied tool in his hand. He drops it to the ground and slides it across the wet grass with his foot.

Looking up, then, into the darkness beneath leaves, Mr. Morrigan feels a deep sense of dread root in his gut. Before anything more can happen, he turns around and flees to the comfort of his house.

His dog stands at the end of the hallway, wagging her tail with barely-contained excitement. Mr. Morrigan should think the sight is very cute, but instead he thinks of how badly he just wants to go to sleep and how the attention-seeking dog would get in the way of that agenda. He attempts to walk around the animal with no further interaction, but instead his pet jumps up and places her paws upon his chest.

Instinctually, his hands go to the dog’s shoulders, but a dark idea lights up in his brainthat seems like an irresistible notion. Placing his hands up, one on the sweet dog’s head and one beneath her snout for leverage, Mr. Morrigan twists with an abrupt motion. A crack sounded loudly from the poor animal, and then she fell limply to the floor at her owner’s feet.

Mr. Morrigan is only distraught by the time-consuming task of having to move the body when he’s so tired, and decides he’ll dispose of her tomorrow morning. Leaving his beloved pet in the hallway outside his door, he slips into his bedroom.

Waking up the next morning, he merely scooted the animal with a foot to get her out of the way— too lethargic, still, to remove the roadblock. He does the usual morning routine of brushing his teeth, doing a quick shave, and taking a shower before he finally stands in the hallway with dripping hair.

Frowning at the thing that used to be his dog but what now smells worse than she did before, Mr. Morrigan grabs it by the tail and drags her relatively heavy body across the floorboards. Once outside, his gaze lands on the cellar door. Just as before, with the neighbor’s cat, the man throws his own pet down the dimly lit staircase.

This time, her body stops rolling at the fourth stair, and Mr. Morrigan lets out a loud huff at the inconvenience. Stepping down to her, he nudges her to fall in between the steps with the tip of his shoe.

That taken care of, he went to work. It was a long, boring day of un-events. No new cases, no new leads on the ongoing cases that were long dried up of evidence. Needless to say, when Mr. Morrigan was back at home, he was seeking *something* entertaining.

Before opening the backdoor to go inside his home, the man paused. He turned around

toward the forest, believing something was watching him. His gaze turns to the cellar, where he knows now there is something lurking in the dark, some things he’s been fascinated by lately.

Opening up the hatch of it, Mr. Morrigan stepped down, running his hand along the dusty wall as he always did, catching on cobwebs on the way to the light switch. When he flicked it on and made it to the bottom, the two furry bodies were revealed to the light. He should be repulsed by the sight of somewhat distended bodies and the blood pooling on the cold concrete, but instead he kneels down to examine it.

After about 3 hours of spending time with things that could not spend time with him, Mr. Morrigan made his way out of the darkness. Surprisingly, he emerged out into darkness, as well. He must’ve lost track of time down there, and the stars were out.

It would be almost pretty if it wasn’t for the fact that the woods were only now even darker than before, even more foreboding. The grass and the trees sounded louder and the chills Mr. Morrigan felt were more intense when the moon was out. Still in fear of what he might come face to face with, the man hurries inside the comfort of his home.

Mr. Morrigan attended the funeral for his neighbor’s brother that weekend. The graveyard was damp and dreary, lifeless besides those few surely buried under the dirt and left to suffocate. Everyone stood, dressed in dark and staring at the ground or flicking their eyes up to the closed coffin. Closed, because the man inside was too torn up to see.

He glances around the expansive space with little except grass and headstones. The gentle covering laid atop the coffin ruffled in the wind and he imagined someone alive in it. Someone shaking it as they try to escape, bloodied and injured but not as dead as they were thought to be. He leaves the ceremony without a word to any of the other attendants, and though they’re all crying, he needs to wipe nothing from his own eyes.

When he’s gathered enough animal bodies to carpet his bedroom, Mr. Morrigan begins to think bigger. The woods talk to him louder, and each time he busts another murderer he gets more and more amused with how stupid they all are.

He stands in his backyard, having just come up from the cellar of which the scent has become unbearable, but Mr. Morrigan is much too enthralled with his collection to care. He stares in between the trees, feeling much more different than he had before. He was almost steely, ready for what was to come, encouraged by the fact even.

The leaves barely rustle and it's almost as if the trees will offer nothing to him tonight. A branch cracks on the forest floor. A gruesome hand with deadly-looking claws wraps around the trunk of a small oak. It’s far away, but the man can make out something that looks human, yet unsettlingly off.

Mr. Morrigan shivers, though he doesn’t run away to his house this time. He makes what he believes to be eye contact with the morbid thing, clenching and unclenching his fists at his sides.

Its skin looked ragged, drooping in places, and almost moldy. It opened its mouth, and its teeth were a horrible rust brown. *Kill them*, it said, not aloud but in his head, *Kill them for me*.

So he fashions a lovely knife out of his pitchfork’s tine and he goes out in the dark with every preparation planned for. With his gloved hands, he helps people meet a swift and secret end. On the street, in an alley, during visits to families involved in his very own investigations, he takes them one by one to his cellar, lifeless.

He attends funerals he’s never invited to, sneaking up on stragglers and taking them out when they’re down. He digs tirelessly with his spade until he can crumple his victims up in them with some difficulty.

Coming back from an early shift, Mr. Morrigan drags out his catch of the day— a distraught young woman who swore she would never be involved in her cousin’s murder. She’s a bit heavy, and Mr. Morrigan has some struggle to bring her out of his car and down the stairs of the cellar.

He’ll look at his collection again later, opting to get some rest from such a long day instead. The detective slips back into his house with the voice of the creature from the woods in the back of his mind.

Within the next few days his collection grows, and his tactics become more adventurous, more risky, one would argue. But he’s still confident that he’ll never get caught. And still every day he’s proven right, able to do his detective work and come back with no repercussions.

After a week goes by, he gets called in to the police station, though he’s told it’s not for work. Only disturbed faintly by the vagueness of the request, he’s still sure it could never be about what he’s been putting to practice lately.

He pulls into his reserved space in the lot, humming to himself as he walks in. Then immediately, he’s apprehended. Mr. Morrigan still doesn’t believe anything could’ve gone wrong, laughing at his coworkers as they tug him further into the building.

“What is this? It’s not my birthday, is it?” He chuckles, though slightly discomforted by the rub of cuffs against his wrists. His associate frowns at him sharply.

“You’re suspected of murder. Lisa said she saw you this morning dragging a body-like object into your cellar. When you came in to work, we checked it out…” The man shook his head solemnly. “I can’t believe you’ve been hiding this, Mr. Morrigan.”

Dread drops and swirls low in his stomach. This is surely his own end. He figures hewasn’t quite as good as he thought he could be. His ego had gotten ahold of him just as the creature in the woods had grabbed his mind and twisted it further.

In the end, Mr. Morrigan has to admit his guilt. It was surely incriminating to have multiple bodies in your cellar. He tells the people he was once friends and close associates with where he’d put the ones not able to be transported.

He can only really be at peace with the resolution. He’s almost grateful for the severing of the creature’s grasp and the darkness of his mind that will come. He thinks of this because Mr. Morrigan was convicted of murder and subsequently sentenced to death.",1,1758079701.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1nj2a0e,https://a.co/d/1sOYOVz,Local author release – “The Room We Choose” (set in Minneapolis),"Hey everyone, I’m a struggling local author just trying to make my imprint on the world. I recently published The Room We Choose, a near-future story set right here in Minneapolis.

Beneath the quiet hum of Minneapolis winters, two strangers decide to turn their phones face down — and, in doing so, turn toward each other.

Jack fixes the things most people never notice: squeaking vents, crooked tables, failing heaters. Lina writes words that rarely survive the scroll. When a chance meeting in the University of Minnesota’s Coffman Memorial Union leads to coffee, they begin tracing the fragile boundaries between connection and performance, authenticity and expectation.

As Jack and Lina navigate mentorship launches, viral clips, meme pages, and the strange choreography of modern dating, they set their own rules:

Phones down. No tests. Tell the truth, even when it’s messy.

But in a world where every moment risks becoming content, can two people choose each other without letting the internet choose for them?

The Room We Choose is a deeply human, intimate, and sharply observed novel about love, vulnerability, and the courage it takes to be seen without filters.

I’d be incredibly thankful if you gave it a look and shared your thoughts—it would mean a lot to me. Here’s the link:

1nj24n7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1nj24n7/are_they_gonna_fire_me/,Are they gonna fire me?,"Hi, I 20 NB have worked at a smoothie company for a year and a quarter or so, recently I got hired at a coffee shop and I kept my smoothie job at the same time. Technically, I work three jobs, although my third job is an acting gig that rarely ever happens, it’s more so a call me in if they need me job on Saturdays.

Now that you know my situation, let’s go into the problem. 

Recently with my smoothie job and me just starting training with my other job, I had to pick and choose what days I would work each job. I need the money to live the life I like to live, go on vacations, be able to have fun. Not like I’m living super lavish, though. As everyone knows the cost of living right now is hell, and the ability to do fun things is very slim for most people.

Anyway, with my smoothie job, I work Tuesday Thursday, and early Saturdays.

With my barista job, I work Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and early Sunday. 

Nonstop, though, my smoothie job has given me nothing but 7 AM’s, I never used to work mornings, I was almost strictly a mid shift and closer. This is because I’ve made it clear to them that I do not do well in mornings, I could fall asleep, standing up, fall asleep while driving, etc. These are very real concerns, that I’ve brought up to medical professionals and they’ve been dismissed. not to mention my smoothie job has me only working four hour shifts each time. I don’t mind shorter shifts, especially with me having three jobs, what time I don’t get there, I typically get at the other. But I just think the shift is odd.

I understand that school season just started, and the minors that we work with also need shifts, which means that if they do work on their school days, they have to come in for closing shifts. That’s totally fine. But having me work back to back to back 7 AM’s is insane, especially for what I have expressed to my managers.

I’m not joking when I say that I typically closed, or that I typically did mid shifts. I did that so often that when they started piling 7 AM shifts on me I had to relearn how to open. 

The worst part of all of this is I work morning shifts at my barista job, considering they’re only open until 7 PM, (my smoothie job is open until 9 PM.) Therefore, I am working almost exclusively early mornings in an extremely fatigued state.

I wish that I had a diagnosis to be able to explain everything that’s going on with me, but unfortunately I don’t. It would be a lot of money, and a lot of time that I cannot spend towards probably getting nothing out of it. Another thing about me is that I have type one diabetes, and so when I go in for other issues that are arising, typically doctors like to shift the blame on that. So before you comment that I’m being dramatic, me falling asleep behind the wheel or falling asleep standing up is 100% real, and it makes me utterly miserable. If you have ever been in a situation where you were so exhausted that it felt like your face was melting off, that’s me almost every morning. Not asking for medical advice, just simply stating the struggle that I’m going through right now.

With that, my final question is, are they slowly trying to get rid of me? Should I quit my smoothie job? I really don’t know what to do, I need the money from both of those jobs, but I really feel like I’m not even being listened to at my smoothie job. Another reason I don’t wanna quit is I feel like I’ve established friends at the smoothie place and it would make me so sad to not get to see them during shifts.",1,1758078864.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

My daughter has NEVER enjoyed school, often has felt left out and picked on for no good reason. She has always been closer to her older and younger siblings and their friends than kids at school. She had one male friend for years and the his dad ended up being a child predator so we had to end that friendship. Her teacher last year I really did not like, he was very clearly not interested in behaviour management and would just teach and expect kids caught up or got help outside of school and would just hang out and reward the rest of the class while ignoring those that were struggling, and while my daughter wasn’t struggling she felt like it was rude she was just constantly being told to play Minecraft education while her classmates were all six lessons behind her. This year she’s attending a public school not really in our area but by my parents house in a desperate hope it would be better for her (as well as her younger siblings). She’s making SO many friends, doing so well! She has never been so happy everyday. Literally she was in tears today in happiness because not only did her friend buy her a treat at lunch but her teacher put them in the same group for reading and math. I also just love how much the teacher is communicating and seems to be invested in her job. It’s grade 6 but she’s treating us (in a good way!) like we’re all new parents and just being so open with communication about what’s going on in class and school. And I really like that she went home already take home reading activities to push the kids to read because I have older kids that I would love if there was some sort of incentive to read for them because they will not read 😞

Anyways my daughter wants to make her a really big thankyou card and I’m helping her write a nice message explaining how happy she is this year to be with you and I want to include a nice little gift to really just say thank you. I really haven’t had a kid this happy to attend school since before Covid. Would like a coffee gift card be good? My daughter says she’s sure she’s seen her drinking frozen coffee.

1nj1rtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1nj1rtt/longtime_boycotter_and_heres_what_ive_learned/,Longtime boycotter and here's what I've learned. Long winded but no AI used!,"I've been boycotting non fair trade coffee, beer and clothing(fast fashion) for the better part of this century so I'd like to share what I've learned: 

1) Don't be judgemental or sanctimonious to impose your own principles because it just doesn't work, instead, use the other reasons why you enjoy the product and give them agreeable reasons (my examples below ) to choose the product and don't refuse an offering (it's rude and just makes you look like an ass). 
 
A Coffee example: When people offer to get me Tim Hortons, I order a milk or chocolate milk ""I'm a coffee snob when I went to Brazil, I had my first real coffee and haven't gone back since, a small, talented roaster can create a roast that is like wine, you can taste different flavors, also..they buy direct from the farmer so they know what they're getting and the farmers are fairly paid.

B Beer example: If a person offers me a Canadian/Budweiser, I say thank you and find an alternative for my next drink. I'm a beer snob,I went to Munich on my first European backpack trek for Oktoberfest and nothing can beat a fresh beer, also most of the ingredients are locally procured so I'm supporting small business and farmers. 

C. Clothing:When they tell me how cheap they got their Old Navy/Walmart/Joe item, I tell them how much I love my Old Navy/Walmart/Joe item and that I thrifted it and how cheap I got it, recently picked up old Navy pant with tags for 1.50! (if you use this one be cognizant of folks with non-standard body types, thrifting isn't easy for them and sustainable fashion is expensive)' I'm super careless with my clothes, and I'm supporting local consignment entrepreneurs who I've got great pieces from.. my 1000k Jbrand jeans for example, that I got for 40 bux ...they have an eye for quality! Also ..lady-owned!

2) It's spherical you don't have to choose everything to be a successfu boycotter: just think in circles. Think of your easiest, totally Canadian choices as your smallest circle, what you can always do, your mid circle are choices  that you can sometimes do, and can choose non-american alternatives and your largest circle as something you might never be able to do, some American products are just cheaper and better. 

3)Choose your words but don't make them battles. Example: to co worker 1, who loves baseball:I've minimized my American consumption so didn't get the MLB app but you have Sportsnet, what happened in last night's game? to co-worker 2 whose going to Florida for a music fest: that sounds really fun, I hope you have a great time. Everyone has to choose their choices, it doesn't make them bad 

4.Passive aggression is great on strangers. I walk by a Timmy's that is directly across from a local bakery in a mall. I pretend I'm on my phone while saying  ""Just walking by the Timmy's and the folks who support slave labour and a maple washed American company when there's a Canadian business across the way...they'd rather f***Trudeau than have sovereignty(I live in Alberta) "" Never once have I been confronted, but it's a drive-by comment, use this tactic safely and sparingly.

4. All my boycotts have been small, this one isn't ...when I first asked Starbucks if they have fair trade, the barista told me that ""They don't carry that brand""...they have since developed a trademarked version of fair trade that isn't real because they have lost a significant market share to consumers who demand an exceptional product that pays it's producers fairly. The Buy Canada/EU boycott is having a significant impact, even Like-minded Americans are doing it. Be steadfast, I can buy fair trade coffee in 5 coffee shops in my hood, and it's because a small number of people believed it 25 years ago ...way more believe in this one. Stay steadfast, boycotting works!


So that's what I've learned, hope it helps! Truly appreciate you all

*Where Baseball Meets Stand-Up Comedy*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in baseball, math doesn’t lie (unlike a pitcher who’s had six cups of coffee for breakfast). The Hanwha Eagles are the clear favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **-400 to -500** (decimal: \~1.5), implying a **60%+ chance to win**. The Kia Tigers, meanwhile, are priced at **+400 to +550** (decimal: \~2.5-2.74), giving them a **28-37% implied probability**. That’s the statistical equivalent of asking a toddler to solve a calculus problem—possible, but not advisable.

The spread tells a similar story: Hanwha is favored by **1.5 runs**, with odds of **-110/-110** across books. The total runs line is set at **8.0**, with **Over** and **Under** odds hovering near **evens** (1.85-1.95). Given Hanwha’s recent offensive explosion (An Chi-hong’s 3-RBI homer in their last game would make a demolition expert weep) and Kia’s pitching woes (their starter, Kim Geon-guk, has a 6.44 ERA that’s more “comedy hour” than “postseason contender”), the **Over 8.0** feels like a statistical inevitability.

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Draft Drama, and a Vet’s Redemption**  
The Eagles are riding a **two-game winning streak**, fueled by An Chi-hong’s recent heroics. The veteran first baseman, despite a dismal 2025 season (.167 BA), has suddenly become the team’s offensive sparkplug. His 3-run homer last game? A **115-meter moonshot** that would’ve won a home-run derby if the Derby had a “please don’t hit my house” rule. Manager Kim Kyung-moon’s decision to bat An lead-off? Either genius or a Hail Mary, but with a .294 career average, it’s the baseball equivalent of betting on a warhorse with a slight limp.

The Tigers, meanwhile, are stuck in a **postseason drought** and facing a pitching crisis. Starter Kim Geon-guk’s 6.44 ERA is about as reliable as a toaster in a monsoon. To make matters worse, the KBO draft—where 1,261 players are vying for 110 spots—is looming. While this shouldn’t affect tonight’s game, it’s worth noting that Kia’s draft pic

I'm a single dude in my mid-30s relocating to Toronto for work (Marketing & Sales gig – exciting but nerve-wracking change!). I'll be living around Eglinton and Yonge St., so super central but totally new to the city. As someone who's more of an introvert at heart, I'm eager to build some connections and make this feel like home ASAP.

A bit about me to give you an idea of potential vibes:

Books: Huge horror fan – Stephen King is my GOAT, and I've devoured Neil Gaiman's stuff too. Always up for book club chats or swapping recs.

Sports: I play tennis and pickleball a couple times a week (not pro-level, but I won't embarrass you on the court). Also a moderate gym-goer – nothing crazy, just consistent cardio and weights.

General: Work keeps me busy, but I love grabbing a coffee, exploring neighborhoods, or catching a low-key event.

Question for you Torontonians: What's the best way for a guy like me to make new friends here? Any recommendations for:

Local meetups, clubs, or leagues for tennis/pickleball/gym groups?
Book clubs or events focused on horror/fantasy lit?
General newcomer tips – apps, bars, volunteer spots, or casual hangouts that aren't overwhelming for someone flying solo?

I'd love any advice, stories from your own experiences, or even ""hey, we should grab a game sometime"" vibes. Thanks in advance – can't wait to dive into TO life!

[Neuro Energizer Review](https://preview.redd.it/e851v2rc2npf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec323e9483c8c3e0901451e37211e6b805a86ccf)

I used to think I was doomed to struggle with focus. My desk was a graveyard of unfinished projects, coffee cups, and half-baked “productivity hacks” that never delivered. Every time I sat down to work, my mind scattered in a thousand directions. It felt like success was always just out of reach.

Then something unexpected happened. I stumbled on an audio program built around **binaural beats and brainwave entrainment**. At first, I rolled my eyes. Another gimmick? But curiosity won. I put on my headphones, pressed play, and within minutes I felt my mind shift. It wasn’t hype—it was like someone had flipped a switch in my head.

That first session gave me a taste of what was possible. My thoughts slowed down, distractions faded, and for the first time in months I sank into deep, uninterrupted work. The longer I used it, the more dramatic the results became. Suddenly, I didn’t need to fight for focus—it came naturally. My to-do list shrank faster than ever, my **mental clarity sharpened**, and my energy didn’t crash in the afternoon like it used to.

Here’s the kicker: it didn’t just help me at work. The **relaxation techniques** built into the tracks became my secret weapon at night. Instead of tossing and turning, I dropped into deep rest, waking up charged with fresh energy. That alone changed everything. My mornings transformed from sluggish drags into powerful launches.

People started asking me what I was doing differently. The truth? I had tapped into a simple **focus booster** that rewired how I worked, rested, and created. This wasn’t another quick fix. It was an **energy upgrade** that built consistency, discipline, and a sustainable **success mindset**.

In just a few months, I was hitting deadlines ahead of schedule, taking on projects I would’ve once avoided, and actually enjoying the grind. My income climbed, my stress dropped, and I felt in control again.

I don’t believe in magic pills. But I do believe in tools that actually work when you give them a real chance. This one became the missing piece in my journey toward **peak performance and self improvement**.

Looking back, I realize I was never “unfocused” by nature. I just hadn’t found the right way to train my brain. Once I did, everything changed.

The real shift started when I committed to using **Neuro Energizer** daily. At first, I just threw on the tracks when I felt mentally foggy, but then I realized the real magic came from consistency.

Here’s what it looked like in practice:

**Morning Ritual**  
Instead of scrolling my phone and wasting my first burst of energy, I put on the “focus” track with headphones. Within 10 minutes, it felt like my brain had locked into work mode. No caffeine jitters. No dragging myself through the motions. The **brainwave entrainment** guided me into a calm but laser-focused state where tasks that normally drained me suddenly felt effortless. That was the first sign this wasn’t just a placebo.

**Work Sessions**  
The more I used it, the faster I could slip into what people call “the flow state.” I’d put on a session, open my laptop, and suddenly two hours would pass in what felt like minutes. My productivity doubled without working longer hours. That’s the part that blew my mind—this wasn’t about grinding harder, it was about working smarter by syncing my mind with the right frequencies.

**Afternoon Energy Crash**  
Normally I’d hit that 2 pm wall and reach for sugar or another coffee. Instead, I tested the **energy booster track**. It didn’t just wake me up—it reset my mental clarity so I could push through the rest of the day without burnout. Over time, my reliance on caffeine dropped, and my natural energy levels actually improved.

**Evening Reset**  
This might be the most surprising part. The relaxation sessions helped me disconnect after a long day. Instead of my mind racing with unfinished to-do’s, I’d unwind in minutes. My sleep improved dramatically, which meant I woke up sharper, calmer, and more creative. The domino effect was huge: better rest led to better focus, which led to better results.

What makes it powerful is how **Neuro Energizer targets different brainwave states**. When I needed focus, it tuned me into beta waves. When I needed creativity, it shifted me into alpha. When I needed deep rest, it guided me toward delta. Before this, I didn’t even realize my brain had “gears” I could shift into.

The bottom line? Neuro Energizer didn’t just help me work harder. It rewired my routines, eliminated wasted energy, and gave me the mental edge I was missing. It turned stress into momentum and gave me a repeatable system to stay at **peak performance**.

Now, instead of constantly chasing motivation, I have a reliable tool that keeps me locked into a **success mindset**. The kind of mindset where projects get finished, opportunities get seized, and success compounds.

**What is Neuro Energizer?**  
Neuro Energizer is a digital audio program that uses **binaural beats and brainwave entrainment** to help improve focus, boost productivity, reduce stress, and promote better sleep. It’s designed as a self improvement tool for anyone who wants more mental clarity and energy.

**How does Neuro Energizer work?**  
It works by guiding your brain into specific brainwave states using carefully engineered sound frequencies. For example, beta waves help with concentration, alpha waves with creativity, and delta waves with deep rest. This allows you to unlock focus, relaxation, or energy on demand.

**How long does it take to feel results?**  
For me, I noticed effects in the very first session—especially with focus and energy. The real transformation happened after consistent use over a few weeks, when it became part of my daily routine. Like any powerful tool, the more you use it, the stronger the benefits.

**Is Neuro Energizer safe?**  
Yes, it’s generally safe for most people. It’s just audio tracks, so there are no side effects like with stimulants or supplements. That said, if you have epilepsy or other neurological conditions, it’s smart to consult your doctor before using brainwave entrainment.

**Can Neuro Energizer replace coffee or energy drinks?**  
For me, it did. I used to rely on caffeine to get through the day, but with Neuro Energizer I no longer needed constant refills. Instead of spikes and crashes, I had steady, natural energy.

**Who is Neuro Energizer best for?**  
It’s ideal for students, entrepreneurs, creatives, or anyone who wants to **boost focus, productivity, and mental performance** without burning out. It’s also perfect if you struggle with stress, overwhelm, or poor sleep.

**Does Neuro Energizer come with a guarantee?**  
Yes, there’s a 60-day satisfaction guarantee. That was one of the reasons I tried it in the first place—I knew I could get a full refund if it didn’t work for me.

**Where can I get Neuro Energizer?**  
It’s only available online through the official website. Once you order, you get instant digital access to all the audio tracks and guides.",1,1758077349.0,ReviewDaily,0,1.0,False

### Parsing the Odds: Math, Mayhem, and Mild Midlife Crises

The numbers scream “Hanwha party!” with implied probabilities hovering around **62.5%** for the Eagles (decimal odds of 1.53) and a paltry **27%** for the Tigers. The spread (-1.5 for Hanwha) suggests this won’t be a nail-biter unless someone invents a way to turn a 3.30 ERA into a 6.44 ERA mid-game. The total runs line sits at **8.0**, with slightly better value on the over (1.85-1.87 odds) than the under. Why? Because Ryu Hyun-jin, Hanwha’s lefty ace, has a 3.30 ERA, while Kia’s Kim Geon-guk looks like he’s pitching for the *KBO version of a coffee stain* (6.44 ERA).

### News Digest: An Chi-hong’s Resurgence and the Tigers’ Existential Crisis

Let’s start with Hanwha’s hero, An Chi-hong. The veteran first baseman is having a *“I’m here, I’m alive, and I just hit a 115-meter moonshot”* moment. Last game, he went 4-for-4 with 3 RBIs, proving that even a .167 batting average can feel like a .500 slugfest when the stars align. His 2025 stats? *Charming.* A .167 average is like a slow elevator in a two-story building—there’s not much tension. But here’s the twist: Hanwha’s manager, Kim Kyung-moon, trusts him to lead off like he’s narrating a TED Talk on *“How to Swing a Bat Without Tripping Over Your Shoelaces.”*

On the Tigers’ side, their pitcher Kim Geon-guk has an ERA that

1nj1kmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nj1kmb/my_ex_is_joining_my_work_project_after_a_year_of/,"My ex is joining my work project, after a year of not seeing each other.... And I don't know how to act","Hello everyone!

First of all I would like to say that I love you Charlotte! Your videos always keep me company while I'm getting work done and I always giggle listening to your stories.

Please pardon any weird mistakes in my post, english is not my first language, and this is my ever first Reddit post :)

On to the story.

I (34 F) have been working on my current industry for about a decade and I have worked my way up over the years, achieving to finally get my dream job this year after many major projects. My job is not a normal 9 to 5, I work on a kind of industry that has short period projects (about a month or so, per project) and we work on this endless race of starting a job, executing, wrapping and then doing it all over again. I really love it and this has given me the oportunity of meeting all kinds of people and places.

A few years ago, on one of this jobs, I meet a man (let's call him Logan 43 M) who was a vendor for us. I was still in a lower work position and I started to work with him (paperwork, contracts and stuff) and we hit it off. I always thought he was cool, but nothing more. The years went by and we continued to collaborate, and as I rose within my company, we started having more contact, since my job required to have deeper communication with the vendors, and at that point, he was beccoming one of my main and must trusted vendors for very specific needs, including high risk projects. He was kind of the action guy I would call when I saw something risking popping on the horizon.

As time went by we became friends, following each other in social media and casually chatting over our jobs together. He also, became flirthy with me, to the point of actually asking me out for coffee and openly saying he was attracted to me. At the time of this I was on a long term relationship that was rapidly crumbling. Although I was not happy on my relationship, I was not the kind of person to vent about this matters with almost anyone, so when he asked me out I flat out told him I would not be going out for coffee or for anything else with him, as I had a boyfriend.

He, being straight forward as always, asked if I was bothered by him flirthing with me. I said, honestly no. I told him I was not indifferent to him either, but as long as I was on a relationship, I would not be engaging with him in anything more than the friendship we had already built based on our jobs and mutual interests. We agreed to keep things as they were, and he playfully told me that he would keep flirthing as long as I wasn't anoyed by that.

Time kept passing, and I inevitably broke up with my boyfriend. It was a long time coming, so I was upset, but also glad I had finally ended the relationship with a man that was just not right for me.

And so it all began. Shortly after my breakup, Logan and I started talking more and more. He shamelessly flirthed with me everytime we met, and even some of my friends/collegues would ask me what was going on cause they noticed how much Logan would follow me around, call me, chat with me, get me coffee, etc. Eventually we started seeing each other outside of the work place, and I felt I was on a real life fairy tale. He was everything I had always wanted on a man, or at least I thought so at the time.

We were dinamite together. I fell head over heels for him and we dated for about 6 - 7 months. We were getting to know each other, not like formally boyfriend girlfriend relationship, but we would hang out almost everyday, stay at each others house, our close friends knew we were dating and we even went on vacation together. I was in love and I was sure to show him how happy he made me.

Well, in the end it all went to shit. After almost 7 months dating, I started to feel a little uneasy, feeling that he was not very onboard on making the relationship ""official"". It's not like I was asking for marriage and kids. No. I just wanted us to have a conversation and be able to recognize that this was now a relationship. He was my partner and I was his, regardless of the fact that we didn't live together or planned to change any of the logistics of our current days. I just wanted to know I mattered to him, as much as he did to me.

Long story short, turns out he was not ready for that. A lot of past trauma, toxic ex wife, avoidant mother, trauma from childhood and whatnot. A lot happened, but that was the breaking point. We broke up, and I was absolutely crushed.

I actually started therapy after the breakup cause I physically felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest after losing him. It was a very rough time, but with the help of my friends, therapy and my lady balls I managed to pull myself out that very dark place where I had fallen.

It's been about a year and a half since we broke up, and next month it will be a year since the last time I saw or spoke to him.

I think it's important to add that after the break up (like two months after) I was involved in a major accident which resulted in surgery, a long hospital stay, 3 months of not being able to walk and over a year of physical therapy and more therapy to tackle the PTSD that I was left with. 

The day I crashed, I was pulled to the sidewalk (since I couldn't stand) and a good samaritan called the police for help. When asked who they could call for me, I gave them Logan's number and, I kid you not, the man crossed the city in less than 15 minutes (during peak hour), held me on the ground and when he realized the ambulance had not arrived, he picked me up and took me to the hospital himself.

For this, I will forever be greatful to him.

So after all this context.... and after a year of not seeing or talking to him, turns out my feared moment of meeting him again has come. I am currently working on a new job that will force me to work with him  (although I did try to push back on his participation) and I am not sure on how to act on this.

One part of me is nervous and a little excited to see him again after all this time. The other is hurt by the idea of facing someone that broke my heart into a million pieces and wishes I could just ignore him and preteng he doesn't even exist. But the reality is that now my actions on the work place are more on display than before, since I now lead my own team, and I feel the preasure to act profesionally and be civil with him. I also add in the fact that I do not wish to be rude to him.... I feel that if I were rude, this would only show that I still have not fully procesed the grieve of this past relationship and even worst, this would be a horrible thing of me to do to someone who, when I was in need, dropped everything to rush to my aid, no questions asked.

Basically I think that perhaps, I am not as ""over the situation"" as I though, and perhaps I still harbor feelings for him, but I do not want, nor can I allow, my feelings to take over while this is a major project for my company and I will be under the scope on every step.

So, nice people of Reddit. What would you do? Any advice would be welcome. I just don't want to act like a bitch to him (he doesnt deserve it) nor do I want to give him the impression that I wish to be friends again. I only wish I could have further pushed for him to be dismissed of the job all together and that way I could just keep away from him.

1nj1kbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nj1kbk/the_bodies_screamed_when_we_brought_them_back/,The bodies screamed when we brought them back.,"Each time we brought the recently deceased back from the dead, they screamed. We didn’t know why. The studies and preparation made sense in theory, and yet, they screamed. Every time we injected the serum into a cadaver, it would awaken violently, thrashing if it hadn’t been strapped down, and scream until it expired.

I worked at a facility, one that specialised in the study of prolonged longevity, death, and the possible resurrection of dead tissue. We had developed a new compound that appeared capable of repairing and regenerating damaged cells back to full vitality. All our tests on animals showed miraculous results: lifespans extended by years, and in several cases, subjects were brought back from recent death. One rabbit, who came to us at the age of twelve, lived for another ten years within the lab.

Once we were satisfied with the results, we began discussing human testing. Before moving on to live subjects, we wanted to see if we could bring back the recently deceased. We submitted the necessary requests for cadavers and, after navigating a mess of paperwork and red tape, established a steady stream of bodies kept on ice. The individuals sent to us had died from known diseases and had been marked for scientific use. We tried to ensure that the brain had not fully degraded, so we required the bodies to be no more than a few days, at most a week, post-mortem.

The first test was catastrophic.

Generally, when we applied the serum to animals, the body would convulse slightly and, as if waking from sleep, the creature would open its eyes and look at us. One dog we tested even wagged its tail in excitement at the sight of us. But for the first human subject, excitement was the last thing on its mind.

We laid the male subject out on a table, modesty underwear placed on them for decency. Once prepared, we injected the compound at the base of the skull and waited, usually thirty seconds to a minute, for the serum to begin rebuilding neural tissue. Our theory suggested we’d awaken a conscious person, albeit brain-dead. Our hope was to see them fully restored.

Both were wrong.

The subject tensed its entire body before a wave of movement flowed from the neck, down the arms, and through to the feet—as if, in one smooth motion, the ‘soul’ had slid back into its flesh. The hands gripped the sides of the table, the head twitched, every muscle fibre firing in chaotic, distorted spasms. His heartbeat began to pulse on our equipment, sending freshly created blood through the body. We watched in stunned amazement as the body took a long, deep breath. We smiled at the results, we did it.

Suddenly it lurched forward, its upper half snapping upright like a sprung trap. Its face contorted, mouth gaping wide, eyes bulging from their sockets, nostrils flared.

Then the screaming began.

It was a distorted scream, not unearthly, though it could be described as such. But that was only because the sound destroyed its own vocal cords and oesophagus under the sheer strain of what it was trying to emit. It was the sound of an animal, fighting with every fibre of its being to escape. The scream filled the small room, reverberating through the glassware, tearing through me, and likely everyone present.

It peaked as the body began to shake violently, its hands clawing at its own flesh, as if something unseen had gripped it from the inside. The legs trembled with frenetic energy, as if they were desperate to run, before twisting violently to one side. A sickening crack signalled the snapping of the hip.

The body collapsed, falling from the table, its head striking the cold floor with a wet smack. The screaming dragged on for another five frail seconds, then stopped with a final, broken whimper. Revitalised blood began to pool from the fractured skull, the leg bent at an unnatural angle. The noise that had escaped from that corpse felt like something being burned alive, or torn apart. Not that I know what those things sound like… but I imagine that would be the closest approximation.

I wanted to end the tests there and then. But the others insisted, we’d had a breakthrough, and we had to see it completed.

With the second subject, we took no risks. He was strapped tightly to the bench before we began. Another male, mid-forties, dead from a heart attack. My own body tensed in anticipation of what was to come. The injection was administered and, much like the first, the body responded with small, twitching bursts of energy before the spasms began. Bound at the limbs and forehead, its movements were restricted, but not silenced.

No amount of hearing protection could shield us from the guttural growls and screams that forced their way out of the subject’s throat. The entire table rattled beneath him, restraints tightening and tearing deep into the flesh as freshly reanimated blood began to leak from the wounds. Between each shriek and convulsion, the mouth snapped open and shut violently until the tongue was chewed and torn apart. The subject choked on his own blood less than a minute after revival.

We had been instructed to intervene only if the subject could be reasonably calmed. If they expired again, the company would simply supply more bodies, and more funding.

It didn’t matter, the sex, the race, the build, the age, the health before death, or how they died.

They all came back screaming.

After staggering through weeks of what could only be described as unholy experiments, we began testing different methods to sedate and prolong the bodies post-reanimation. One attempt stood out, we purposely severed the vocal cords of a cadaver before revival, hoping to silence the inevitable screaming.

She was a woman, middle-aged, and already pale from death. When she awoke, there were tears already welling in her eyes, as if her mind remembered something her body hadn’t yet caught up with. Her breathing came fast and shallow, accelerating into panicked, rasping sobs, wet, desperate gulps of air like someone drowning in the open.

Though she couldn’t scream, the sounds she made were worse. Muffled cries slipped from her ruined throat, each one a garbled echo of agony that sent shivers through every person in the room. The moans of pain, of disbelief. Grief. Recognition.

Her eyes darted wildly, bloodshot and filled with terror, locking onto each of us in turn as if begging for help or mercy, perhaps both. She tried to lift her arms, but the restraints held her down. Instead, she writhed, shuddering uncontrollably, her body convulsing in silent torment. The tears flowed freely now, tracking down her cheeks in trembling rivulets.

We had silenced her voice, but we hadn’t silenced the pain. If anything, it made it worse, watching her suffer without the outlet to scream. The room was filled with the sound of breath and whimpers, and something else: a low, involuntary whine that came not from her, but from one of the assistants, curled slightly in the corner, unable to look.

We disposed of the subject humanely.

The effect on the staff was undeniable. Conversations shortened, small talk faded, and laughter disappeared entirely. The jokes we once shared over coffee about playing God felt horrific, even dangerous to say aloud. Soon, silence became our default. We spoke only when necessary, and only about work. Every day we showed up, ran the tests, documented the results, and went home. No one asked questions.

The sense of camaraderie we’d built during the animal trials dissolved. The feeling of triumph, of being on the cusp of something extraordinary, turned to quiet dread. The resignations came quietly, one by one. No formal farewells, just an empty desk the next morning. Their replacements arrived with wide eyes and excitement, but that never lasted long.

Due to the confidentiality clauses in our contracts, I wasn’t allowed to contact any of them after they left. I never found out what happened to most of them. But I do remember one clearly. James. A close friend of mine. He was quiet in his final weeks at work, barely spoke, barely ate. Then one day, he didn’t come in. Then I saw the news. He had jumped from the top of his apartment building.

I thought about quitting. I really did. But the raise they gave me was too good to leave.

Our results were yielding nothing. Every subject we brought back either screamed, wailed, or violently thrashed before eventually expiring, or being put down.

With permissions, we began to explore the unconventional. We dabbled in pseudoscience and religious dogmata, anything that might offer an answer science could not.

The people we brought in were paid obscene amounts and sworn to absolute secrecy. Toward the end, even threats were issued. One hypnotist, an odd woman with steady hands and tired eyes, was brought in to help calm the subjects. Her role was to attempt to induce a calm state as we gradually reanimated, stimulating isolated regions of the brain one at a time while keeping the rest dormant.

For a while, it seemed promising. We ran countless sessions, and on one occasion, after several attempts and enough sedatives to drop an elephant, a subject stirred gently under hypnosis.

There was a breath, a shallow, ragged gasp of pained air squeezed through clenched teeth.

Then a single word.

“Why?”

It was faint. Barely audible. A tremble of soul-deep confusion and grief.

And then, the screaming returned, more feral and violent than before. The subject convulsed so hard the restraints tore deep into the flesh. The hypnotist never returned after that session. She didn’t even collect her final pay.

After her, we were truly desperate. We brought in a priest, an ageing man with a cautious demeanour, willing to participate in hopes of finding some sort of answer. None of us were superstitious, but something in the screaming had begun to strip away our rationality, our sense of detachment. It felt as though each reanimation peeled back another layer of our humanity, leaving something hollow and shaking beneath.

The priest performed a full exorcism over the cadaver as it reanimated. He held a crucifix above its chest and muttered Latin gospels with trembling conviction. Strangely, the body responded. It strained violently against the restraints, muscles taut as steel cords, but it didn’t scream. Not at first.

The priest’s words seemed to still it, but only for a moment. Then the corpse snapped upright with terrifying force, tearing free of the table as metal bolts ripped from the floor. It lunged, flailing wildly. The priest stumbled back, narrowly avoiding a crushing blow to the head, and managed to escape with no significant injury.

What followed was not panic, but fury. He shouted at us, eyes wild, accusing us of blasphemy. “You’re dragging sinners from hell,” he screamed. “You’re summoning torment, not salvation!” His voice cracked as he ranted and raved, his tone eerily echoing the corpses we’d brought back. Then he left, stormed out of the facility, never to return.

From that point on, armed guards were stationed in every session. Not that it mattered. The sessions didn’t last long after that anyway.

For one final try, one more attempt to gain any understanding, we turned away from the mystical and into even more eccentric science. We selected an elderly subject, late 90s, died of natural causes. A quiet death, with no visible trauma. We surgically detached his spinal column from the base of the brain, severing all motor function. The body was essentially quadraplegic, incapable of movement or speech. Only the essential organ connections were maintained.

Then, we installed a neural interface, an experimental chip connected directly to the brainstem and visual cortex, linked to a computer in the adjacent observation room. It was programmed to interpret neural signals and convert them into written text.

Only a few of us remained by this point. We sat in silence behind the thick glass, monitors glowing faintly in the dim observation room. The only other person present inside the subjects room was the armed guard, now a permanent fixture, with orders to terminate the subject immediately if necessary.

We administered the injection and waited.

There were no spasms, no strained limbs, no hideous sounds of vocal cords tearing. Just the soft, rhythmic beep of a heart restarting and the subtle rise and fall of a chest drawing breath. The room was so silent, it felt as though the screams of the previous cadavers echoed from memory into the still air.

Then the text flashed on screen:

‘Where am I?’

We froze.

Even though it was only text, something in my mind gave it life. I heard the voice behind it. An old man. Tired. Confused.

We typed back.

‘Who are you?’

‘John Forrester. Who are you?’

‘We’re here to help, John. How old are you?’

‘Ninety-six. Who are you?’

The information matched. We were finally getting somewhere.

Then the next message appeared:

‘Are you him?’

We paused.

‘Who?’

There was a long silence.

Then:

‘You’re not him. No, no no.’

John’s heart rate began to climb. The breathing grew rapid. His test flashed again.

‘You’re not supposed to know.’

We stared at the screen, unsure how to respond. My assistant looked at me, her mouth slightly open, but I said nothing.

‘You’re not supposed to know.’ He repeated.

I looked through the window.

John’s eyes were open.

Wide. Wet. Unblinking.

Tears streamed down his cheeks, pooling on the slab beneath. It shouldn’t have been possible.

‘He won’t let me back. You’re not supposed to know.’

The cursor blinked.

I turned to the screen again, only to see another message.

‘He won’t let you.’

Pause.

‘He won’t let you.’

Again.

And again.

And again.

My heart thudded painfully in my chest, matching the BPM displayed on the monitor. My breathing grew shallow. Then I heard something.

Not in my mind.

Real sound.

I looked up.

John’s mouth was moving.

Impossible. His nerves were severed.

His lips parted wider. Sound emerged, quiet at first, but real. Tangible.

“He won’t let you…”

I froze. I shouldn’t be able to hear it through the glass but I heard it. The guard looked to me for the termination signal.

I shook my head. Not yet.

“He won’t let you…”

The whisper grew in volume, ragged and forced from a throat that should’ve been silent.

“He won’t let you! He won’t let you! He won’t let you! He won’t let you! He won’t let you! HE WON’T LET YOU!”

The gunshot was final.

The sound rang out across the lab like a gavel striking the lid of a coffin. John’s body slumped against the slab, what remained of his expression frozen in wide-eyed agony. The guard, shaking, holstered his weapon and left the room without a word.

The silence that followed was suffocating.

I collapsed back into my chair. My ears rang, not from the shot, but from the absence of everything else. No monitors, no voices, no screams.

Just silence.

I didn’t know what to report. I didn’t know what I just witnessed.

The project was terminated soon after, officially deemed a dead end. We were compensated generously, bonuses, severance, hush clauses buried in legalese. More than enough to vanish, to start over, to never work again.

But money does nothing for the silence.

I sit here now, alone, typing these words. Surrounded by a silence so heavy it feels alive. Suffocating. Endless. To fill that silence, my mind conjures John’s voice, Lingering on his words.

I now wish for the screaming instead.

Rent, utilities, Wi-Fi, random Target runs, even just setting up a basic dorm room, it all stacks up like a whole extra class on top of the actual classes.

Back home I saw relatives get buried in credit card debt, so I’ve always been cautious. Now I’m here trying to keep track of coffees, snacks between lectures, textbooks that cost way more than I expected, groceries, and a Pepco bill I didn’t even think about when planning. Living on my own is giving me the independence I wanted, but my budget already feels stretched thin.

I’m trying to stick to a budget and I know building credit matters, but I really don’t want to dig myself into a hole before freshman year is even over. A couple people mentioned debit cards that build credit, where you’re only spending what you already have but it still reports to the bureaus. That honestly sounds more my speed while I’m still figuring this out. Has anyone here actually used one? Did it help your score? Any hidden fees or downsides I should watch out for?

Also looking for local tips. Best ways Terps keep utilities down once it gets colder? Any internet options in College Park that don’t suck but also aren’t overpriced? For groceries do most people lean Lidl, Aldi, or Giant? And what’s the move for textbooks besides McKeldin or Amazon?

Right now I’m mostly walking, taking the Shuttle UM, cooking more instead of always hitting Route 1 spots, and trying to give myself a weekly cap for “fun” money so I don’t burn through cash too quickly. Would love to hear what’s worked for other people here.

1nj1hol,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1nj1hol/would_you_casually_date_someone_somewhat/,Would you casually date someone somewhat *physically* unattractive? Virgin,"I hate to word it that way because like... they're a person and didn't pick their parents, and they're a cool person. But... they just aren't that pretty and they're like... kinda a loserish (unemployed living w/ family late 20s?)

Idk, this is kinda a nasty thing to say I know. Reflecting- it doesnt bother me at all, a lot of the things i'm into... aren't all that tied to physical aesthetics now that I think about it.

  
I have extremely bad anxiety and terrible self confidence. never approached someone in public. Working on this, have had good results with exposure therapy over the last few months just doing volunteer work and having casual conversations with people. Also made some basic smalltalk near daily on various errands, eye contact, smile etc practice with strangers. Back to dating- I had 3 separate dates with more objectively pretty women who even then I'm pretty... on paper a decent match for? that I bailed the day of on. Absolutely terrified and chickened out so hard multiple times.

I matched with someone because of their bio and went on a date. And it was actually okay. I was still insanely nervous but i think they were more than i was so idk if they even noticed tbh. we talked for about an hour.  it's at the point where #2 (she wants to cook for me) is planned and there was some banter around initiating physical touch so... i mean shes probably interested in at least some sort of intimacy.

Anxiety in other areas (school and work) i've found has gotten WAY way better with exposure therapy. I'm probably autistic, officially adhd but undiagnosed. Objectively I'm really using this person for exposure therapy. I'm SUPER proud that i actually went on the date, and fairly satisfied with the conversation. I did not do a good job making it feel like a date rather than just a meetup but it seems that is acceptable for a coffee. I'd really like to learn to be a good partner, i'd really like to try out intimacy, am generally touch starved. 

 I'm thinking absolute worst case we go on some fun little dates, maybe get some experience? This person isn't dating with intention in terms of kids/marriage- there's also been no real discussion beyond that which feels ethically a little eh? but also if we're both having fun it's fine right? 

  
Kinda a ramble and just looking for feedback. Typing this up... honestly I'm feeling like i'm putting myself in a bad situation that's disrespectful to her? But also... is it even that serious if we're just yknow, doing fun little activities and maybe having some intimacy without any real discussion?

My stomach growls while my mind remains preoccupied with food to the point where I become unable to focus.
I think people who create hunger attack plans in advance obtain better outcomes than people who attempt to battle hunger through willpower alone. 

Here's what actually worked for me:
Electrolytes are everything. Hunger and dehydration feel really similar and often when I think i'm starving i'm just dehydrated.
Having something for the intense cravings helps too. Been using ozzi during fasting windows since it's basically just natural ingredients.
I learned to avoid starting with extended fasting periods right away. Started with 14 hours and worked up gradually instead of trying to do 20 hour fasts on day one like some keto influencer recommended.. 

Black coffee and herbal tea become your best friends. The warm liquid helps with that ""i need to consume something"" feeling.
Getting in ketosis is definitely the hard part, but does anyone else find that the hunger gets way more manageable once you're actually in ketosis? Those first few weeks are rough but it does get easier.",2,1758076827.0,ketobeginners,2,1.0,False

1nj1ee9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nj1ee9,What are causing my patches/receding hairline/thinning/pimples etc? 20F,"PLEASE HELP 
I’m 20 and i’m experiencing thinning of my hair, hair loss and hair fall, receding hairline, and pimples and patches on my scalp that itch. My scalp itches throughout the day and I also have dandruff. 

The pimples and eventual bald patches started I THINK when i was around 14. I had so much thick hair back then I didn’t really care. I think I would only have a few patches every year, but I’m not really sure. These patches most happen on the sides of my head and around the back. Since then, they’ve pretty much mostly all grown back I think.
I never noticed thinning of my hair and receding hairline really until I was around 17 or 18. That’s when i realized that my scalp would itch, my hair was falling out, it was thinning, and my hairline was receding. I also would still get pimples that itch and eventually turn into bald patches.
My parents made me go to the doctor when I was around 18 and they just said it was from stress and prescribed me a topical cream to grow the patch I had back, and i’m pretty sure it didn’t really work at all. They grow back eventually anyways for me mostly. 
I’m 20 now and it’s still the same. But now it’s getting to a point where I’m not the only one who notices it. 
Please help me. I want to grow my hair back and make my hair and scalp normal again so bad.
Some things i’ve noticed that make it worse I THINK are eating junk food and gluten. It might be placebo but i think it makes the itching and hair loss worse. 
I eat extremely clean for the most part, eating mostly meat and fruit and some veggies. I eat dairy occasionally and try to avoid grains and legumes mostly. I drink tea and coffee ocassionally, mostly tea. 
I have a reverse osmosis shower filter. 
Red light therapy i think seems to help speed up growing back the patches but that could possibly be placebo as well. 
Certain things like certain oils/shampoos I think break it out more i THINK.
I use a very clean shampoo and conditioner.

My only “health history” is that when I was a preteen/early teen, I had self-diagnosed malassezia folliculitis. I believe I had this because my symptoms were flesh colored bumps on the oily spots on my face (mostly forehead). it cleared up using Nizoral shampoo, but then it got used to the Nizoral and came back a little bit. I still have a little bit on my forehead sometimes but it’s not quite as bad. 
I’m wondering if the scalp pimples are fungal related as well? I’m not sure. But i’m not sure if Nizoral would work since I think my body has built a resistance to it. 

Please help me anyone🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼with remedies, cures, suggestions, or any possible diagnosis or idea what is causing all of this!!!!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ambition :** The second guest I’ve had on my stream, Kezman.

**Kezman :** The player Ambition I’ve known, and the streamer Ambition I see now is quite different. You’ve become a professional streamer now, huh. Though the part of you that obsesses over every small thing when it comes to the game has stayed the same.

**Ambition** **:** Have you been keeping up with some of the other old-CJ guys? What about Flame?

**Kezman :** Flame and I still talk a lot. We talked a lot around the end of his career, when he was telling me that he wanted to continue his player career and asking me for advice. Flame’s always been the kind of kid that needs 1-on-1 attention, even back during the CJ days. He’s the kind of player that reciprocates attention with effort. But also the kind of player that will sleep in and start straying if you don’t. I found it kinda funny at the time, because he would pout and go “Why do you only go out for coffee with Ambition?”

**Ambition** **:** He’s always liked being close to his teammates. Helios was very receptive of him. I wasn’t.

**Kezman :** You were more of the cold-shoulder kind of guy at the time that would go “Bro, get off me” when he would try to get close. So that’s why Helios was basically carrying him around everywhere during CJ. He had it rough. Imagine being Helios, where Ambition is always farming your Wraiths, and Flame is always farming your Krugs.

**Ambition** **:** Those were the days. Man, we all lived like hobos back in the MiG house. Everyone wearing faded t-shirts and shorts. I remember when CptJack’s dad came to visit, and took us all out to go eat at Outback Steakhouse. Man. That was everybody’s first time going to someplace that fancy.

**Kezman :** How the times have changed.

**Ambition** **:** He took all the guys from both Blaze and Frost out, too. That was a really big deal, because we were all just living off $3 each for every meal back then. I remember all of us taking care of our meals at a kimbap joint (Korean equivalent of Waffle House), where we would always just order the cheapest thing on the menu.

**Kezman :** Nothing over $5. I think we upped the limit to $7 per person a couple years later. Those were the Dark Ages, because we were all just starting out. OnAir and I would stream all day, then pool our donation money together to feed all of you guys. Reapered as well. Cloudtemplar would also pitch in his stream donations.

**Ambition** **:** How did we even end up paying for our internet café fees?

**Kezman :** We didn’t have to pay for that, because we had a PC-bang as our sponsor. Actually, we did pay. Just at a discounted rate. We had no choice because our gaming house wasn’t big enough, and Blaze had to go practice at that PC-bang instead. It was only after we switched over to Azubu, where structure became a thing. The MiG days were really tough.

**Ambition** **:** I was young at the time, and all I cared about was that I got to play the game I liked. So I think the joy of being paid to play League was bigger than the conditions at the time.

**Kezman :** It got a lot better in 2013 with Azubu. But I remember OnAir and me feeling very sorry, because both of us felt all of you deserved better. It was worse because we were also both dirt poor, and couldn’t do anything about it. That’s why OnAir and I would go participate in MBCGame BroodWar shows to get extra cash for the team. If you took me back though, I’d do it all again.

**Chat :** Did you witness the apology Flame made to Ambition in 2014? You know, because of how his performance prevented CJ from making Worlds that year because he got obsessed with girls.

**Kezman :** That was interesting. So 2014 was when Flame really started becoming popular, and when fans would send him DMs all the time. That was his first time experiencing that kind of popularity, and he kind of got caught up in all of it. That definitely led to a dip in his performance, although he would always deny it.

He told everyone that it wasn’t going to affect his gameplay, so we all just kind of let him be. But when that eventually stopped the team from making Worlds that year, he had his “I f\*\*ked up” realization, and went around begged for everyone’s forgiveness.

**Chat :** Were you also there to witness the hate that formed between CptJack and Ambition?

**Kezman :** I’m not sure how much both of you have opened up about this on stream, so I’m unsure as to where to draw the line.

**Ambition** **:** No lines. You can tell the full story.

**Kezman :** So Ambition wouldn’t go off on any of his new teammates. He was only a dick to the teammates that had always been on Blaze. That’s why Ambition would always be yelling at Helios, although you kind of gave up on him after a while because you thought “He can’t be reformed.”

This actually ties in to a moment I remember quite fondly. So it was when we went to Dallas, I think for IPL. It was the Losers Bracket game where we got smashed by WE, and Helios was playing Amumu. So during the game, Ambition would visibly jump up from his chair in rage whenever Helios would miss an Amumu Q. I remember that moment clearly, because we had no observers back then. So I would be watching the games from your screens a couple feet away. You would literally get so mad at Helios that you would jump up 1 full foot from your chair.

Watching that, I remember having a “How am I going to fix these kids” moment. But I also understood where that was coming from though, because I think all of us felt that we didn’t deserve to lose to WE the way we did.

**Ambition** **:** Back then, the idea of losing to a non-Korean team was unthinkable. So I think emotions were high during that WE game because we had lost to teams like FNC and M5 during the event as well. Yeah, I remember. I remember throwing a fit at CptJack during that event because we got our asses kicked by Rekkles.

**Kezman :** In a way though, I think that kind of drive was what led us to winning IEM 7.

**Chat :** Ambition said during Season 2 that he was the best Midlaner in the world. He also said that xPeke was #2, and everyone else was irrelevant. Thoughts?

**Kezman :** To be honest, that’s also what I thought. At the time, I really did think that no other Midlaner could challenge Ambition. I remember all the non-Korean Midlaners struggling hard in lane against us.

**Ambition** **:** xPeke was really the only Midlaner outside of Korea that I thought was good at the time.

**Chat :** How did you react when you saw Ambition’s Khazix get solokilled by Faker’s Nidalee?

**Kezman :** I honestly didn’t even see why he got killed. It was just unexpected, because I knew Ambition was a kind of player that would never get hit by a Nidalee spear in that kind of situation.

**Ambition** **:** That was old Nidalee too, with the Q projectile being much wider. Before that game, poke Nidalee really wasn’t a thing. That game was what got everyone to start playing the long-range poke Nidalee.

**Kezman :** The evolution was a mistake on Ambition’s part though, with him pressing it out of habit. But at the time, I thought that Ambition was a better Midlaner than Faker. Although I changed my mind once I witnessed what happened in that game.

**Ambition** **:** Nah. Faker was already better than me during his debut year in Season 3.

**Kezman :** You have to understand my position at the time, where I’m not really in the spot to send my player out onto stage with the idea that the opponent is better than him. That Nidalee spear was a wake-up call though. Not only for Ambition, but for me as well.

**Ambition** **:** I was pissed off after we lost that Game 1, but I also did think that “Oh, this kid is good.” I think I was able to internalize that really quick.

**Kezman :** You were always good at accepting things objectively. I remember you always having a very clear idea of which player was, and wasn’t better than you. I think the only people that were on the ‘better’ list were Faker and Ryu.

But hey, that solokill ended up working out for you in the end, right? You were immortalized by becoming the first solokill of League’s icon.

**Ambition** **:** Mhm. I was Faker’s first. Nobody can take that away from me. Always featured in all Faker documentaries and montages.

**Chat :** Who was the most problematic brat of CJ?

**Kezman :** In terms of skill? Or as a human being?

**Ambition** **:** For skill, it’d have to be CptJack. Solely because he was the ADC, and ADC was the position that had the highest expectations during those days. So he was naturally the recipient of everyone’s attention.

**Kezman :** I had high hopes for the CptJack-Lustboy lane, because I knew they were good. CptJack also had a lot of confidence in his play and micro as well. But there was a certain point where he seemed to have hit his ceiling, where his upwards trend kind of stopped.

When it comes to player skill, I always think it’s a constant battle of breaking limits. A constant repetition of stagnation after growth, and additional growth once the player overcomes that stagnation. But for CptJack, his stagnation just kind of continued

**Ambition** **:** For Flame, it was the TP meta. His stagnation started once TP meta started, and he never got over it.

**Kezman :** But CptJack was definitely the type that’s just naturally gifted when it comes to games though. Same for MadLife. But MadLife has low fuel efficiency, where he wasn’t able to play games for extended periods of time.

**Ambition** **:** I think that MadLife would have had a longer career if he wasn’t a Support. As the naturally-gifted kind of gamer, he would’ve thrived for much longer if he played a different position.

**Kezman :** He started out as an ADC though, with him switching to Support because we didn’t have one.

**Ambition** **:** Well, the concept of fixed lanes weren’t a thing back then as well.

**Kezman :** We ended up making him our Support because he gave us the best results. I remember trying out guys like Woong and Locodoco for Support and it not working out at all. That’s a testament to the talent MadLife had as a player though, considering how he was able to succeed at Support without being one in the first place.

**Chat :** Wasn’t Blaze just 5 Junglers that had 4 people roleswap because Helios couldn’t play any role other than Jungle?

**Ambition** **:** It was a different time. All of us were recruited because we were high-tier players, and the only way to get to that point was by being good at every position. Everyone had at least 1 champion for each role in their Top 5-7 most played. It only really changed once the EU Meta became the norm.

**Chat :** Did Riot or the LPL contact you for an interview to star in Uzi’s Hall of Legends documentary?

**Kezman :** I don’t think so. Oh no, I think I did get an interview request. Aren’t there two different versions? Like a Chinese one, and a Korean one.

**Ambition** **:** Yeah. The Korean one is where a bunch of Korean ADCs show up and reminisce on the times they lost to Uzi.

**Kezman :** Man. Only if Uzi didn’t have to deal with his wrist injury. As someone that’s coached him, I can vouch that he was one of the players in China at the time that had the best professional mindset.

One thing I really struggled with during my tenure in China was nurturing that kind of professional mindset with players. Things like what players need to do to get better, practicing champions they didn’t like, etc. I would sit down with a translator and talk about these things with Chinese players all the time.

Again, it was a different time. Of course, all the players were hyper-competitive and wanted to win. But there also needed to be a culture of discipline that went along with it – which was something that a lot of coaches had trouble instilling into players at the time.

The issue kind of stems from how League doesn’t have a correct answer. So conflicts inevitably occur when two players have opposite opinions, and neither side is willing to back down because each player thinks his view is right. This kind of notion existed with Uzi back in 2018 RNG, where he had a view of the game that was centered around him.

But outside of Uzi, we also had extremely talented players like Xiaohu, Mlxg, Karsa and Ming, who were all good at consistently playing their part for the team. So what ended up happening was Uzi letting go of that kind of perspective once we started winning. Before Uzi joined 2018 RNG, he hadn’t won a single Championship. But once we started securing Championships, he was able to let go of a lot of his Championship woes and his self-centered view on the game. I really think that it was a realization moment for him, where he was finally able to let go of that view once he saw that his team was capable of winning without it. It was definitely a turning point in him really opening up to other in-game perspectives for the rest of his career.

**Ambition** **:** I remember a lot of LCK players thinking that Uzi becoming more of a team player was because he was surrounded by good players that actually knew how to play around him.

**Kezman :** We don’t really see it in ADCs now, but Uzi was really a player that loved playing aggressively and hard-pressuring his opponent. To where he would actively request that his Jungler start at a specific camp, or path a certain way to supplement his playstyle. His entire plan revolved around him setting up and winning the Lv3 fight in the Botlane. He loved doing it, and he was good at it. The team realized that he was very good at planning and designing this kind of strategy, and we all committed to fully enable that kind of playstyle.

**Ambition** **:** If you think about it, there’s really no point in having a player like Uzi on your team if your plan is to suppress him and shut him down, right?

**Kezman :** You kind of have to say yes because he is good, and because he proves himself with results, right? The reason why I think 2018 RNG was able to have such a high winrate despite being a one-trick team was because that one trick we had was centered around Uzi. Uzi was just that good, and the players around him that committed to that playstyle were also good.

**Ambition** **:** That was pretty much the story of Samsung as well. We tried all sorts of strategies that involved investing in different lanes. But none of them worked out as well as investing in Ruler, so we would just go all-in on the Ruler one-trick team style. That’s why we lost a lot of games when bruisers became meta, because all the enemy bruisers would just dogpile onto Ruler. It’s also why we crumbled when Herald was added.

**Kezman :** All the additional objectives made the game a lot more difficult, along with shifting the game away from the individual player to the interactions involving those objectives.

**Chat :** Can you elaborate on your beef with NoFe?

**Kezman :** Beef? I don’t really think I’ve had beef with NoFe. We would sometimes disagree on certain things when sharing opinions about the game, or talking about how to construct rosters. But I’ve always seen him as an extremely intelligent person, and someone that just kind of gets stuff done on his own. Even after he transitioned to casting, we would always talk and hang out at LolPark. I don’t really keep up with online forums at all, so I’m not sure that this beef is exactly about.

I guess there could have been discontent on NoFe’s end, because I was in the position to either sign off on the things he wanted to do. So there could have been a situation where there was something he wanted to do on 2020 HLE, where I had to turn down because the team wasn’t in a position to support it. But that’s just discontent that stems from work, right? Not full on beef. Conflicts occur frequently between head coaches, coaches and players all the time throughout the course of a season.

**Chat :** Who was the ADC that was set to start on the main roster for 2020 HLE? Because it was that player revoking his decision 1 week before the season that led to Vsta becoming the starting ADC.

**Kezman :** This isn’t something I can share, because it has directly to do with that player in question.

**Chat :** What about the rumor saying you turned down the organization’s plan to invest a ton of money to buy a superteam during the 19-20 offseason?

**Kezman :** That rumor just doesn’t make sense, because no head coach would ever turn down an organization offering him a blank check. The team is saying that they’re giving you wads of cash to get good players. No head coach would ever say no to that. Who says no to someone that’s trying to give you money? This rumor is just straight up not true.

**Ambition** **:** When someone is trying to give you money, the only acceptable response other than “Yes” is “Can I have more?”

**Chat :** I think that rumor was from when OnAir was the head coach for HLE, not Kezman.

**Chat :** NoFe did say that there were some 2020 HLE stories that can only be told after the LoL scene is dead and 10 years under.

**Kezman :** I don’t know how to answer that, because I don’t know what he was referring to. I need something to go off of.

**Ambition** **:** Just ask directly. Just straight up ask what party I voted for in the recent election. Don’t beat around the bush by saying “I heard you had interesting political preferences.”

**Chat :** Are you aware that the hate for your 2021 HLE drafts instantly died down once the Morgan-Dudu-Yohan-Arthur-Willer Mock Draft Challenge became popular in Korea?

**Kezman :** I’ve heard people mention it to me, yes.

**Ambition** **:** That’s 2021 HLE, right? With Chovy and Deft. Ohh. So people doing mock drafts in 2021 HLE’s perspective was called the ‘Kezman Challenge’. I see.

**Chat :** What was your most difficult off-season while being a part of HLE from 2020 to 2023?

**Kezman :** It would have to be the 19-20 offseason when I first came to HLE. That year was challenging because it was my first year back from the LPL, and I was also given the task of laying down the structure of the HLE League organization. Not only that, but by the time I got signed and started my job at HLE, almost all the free agents for that year had already been signed. So I had to try and make the best out of what was left of the 19-20 player market.

**Ambition** **:** Ohh. That was the HLE season with Cuvee and Haru. Man. Who was responsible for signing Cuvee? Y’all should have asked me about Cuvee before getting him on board.

**Kezman :** I was the one that pushed for Cuvee. The reason being because I thought his potential hadn’t yet been realized when I reviewed his games. From an outside perspective, I wanted to really tap in to the aggressive potential he showed in the past with champions like Kennen and Camille.

**Ambition** **:** That’s one misconception people often have about Cuvee. People think that he was never able to fly because his Jungler would always path towards Botlane. But it was the other way around, where his Jungler would always path Botlane because he couldn’t fly.

**Kezman :** I saw him as a player that was on a team like RNG, and wanted to give him the opportunity to really break through his ceiling by setting him up to become a Toplane carry.

**Ambition** **:** Until then, he’s played for so long on rosters where his role was to survive in a Toplane island to where I think his playstyle had solidified to that one style of play.

**Kezman :** There definitely was an aspect of him being very mild-mannered, which I think was the reason why he was able to play that kind of role for so long. During 2020 HLE, I remember everyone on that roster, including Cuvee and Haru all going through some tough times during the season. Because our results weren’t very good, right?

Cuvee went through a lot that year. I requested that he fulfill a leader role in that team, and he tried his best despite his personality not being a good fit for it. I have a lot of respect for Cuvee.

**Chat :** Is it true that Flame took the least amount of showers in CJ?

**Ambition** **:** CJ was just uh, an embarrassing time for all of us.

**Kezman :** I told you guys, time and time again to not go outside wearing flip-flops. None of you would listen though. All of you would go outside with t-shirts, shorts and flip-flops, when everyone else was going about their workday in business attire. You guys were literally the only ones dressed like that in that entire 9-story building that we were located in.

**Ambition** **:** So the building we were located in was SK M-City, which also happened to be a office complex building in the most high-end area of Ilsan. So it was literally a neighborhood full of people in business attire going about their regular workday. Looking back, we were basically a troupe of hobos walking around a high-end business district.

**Kezman :** You guys wouldn’t change, too. It was always the same green-colored Razer t-shirt and flip-flops. I remember this because the tenants of nearby buildings would file complaints to the team saying that you guys were actively devaluing the neighborhood. They were literally begging us to please have you guys walk around in presentable attire.

**Ambition** **:** We ended up banning flip-flops because of that, right?

**Kezman :** We made a rule against it, but you guys broke it just a couple days later.

**Ambition** **:** Us gamers can’t help it though. It was exactly like that during Samsung too, where we were also located in a really well-off area full of high-paying white-collar offices. We marched around that neighborhood as shameless hobos, with CoreJJ waltzing around with his unorganized, spiky hairdo.

**Chat :** I was the fan that asked for a hug during the 2022 CampOne event. I was a CJ-HLE fan all throughout my teens. I know the role that you played in HLE having their first Championship in 2024, and I want to thank you for it.

**Kezman :** Thank you. It’s really touching that you think of it that way. Considering that HLE won its first Championship the season after I left, I definitely could have been ‘jelly’, right? Even just a little bit. But I was just as happy for HLE when they won. While I wasn’t the perfect head coach for HLE, and made a lot of mistakes during my 2020-2023 tenure – I did get a sense of gratification when I saw some of the players and systems I had put into place bear fruit.

**Ambition** **:** Oh yeah. Because you left HLE after finalizing the roster for the 2024 season.

**Kezman :** It was a synergy of all the players, and also the HLE management’s thirst for success that year. Everything worked out.

**Chat :** Is there a head coach that you consider your rival, or someone that you deem as similar in terms of caliber or career?

**Kezman :** I’ve never really thought about it. But while I was in China, I did view Kkoma as a worthy, or formidable opponent. So before I returned to Korea. I guess I can say this jokingly because I’m good friends with Kkoma.

**Chat :** I feel there’s a lot of confusion as to what the position of ‘Director’ or ‘Supervisor’ (총감독) is in the E-Sports industry, and it’s role in a team. Can you elaborate?

**Kezman :** This is actually something that I’ve wrestled with quite a bit. So when I was promoted to Director/Supervisor, it wasn’t something that I exactly wanted. I actually wanted to continue working as a head coach. So when I was put into that role, I remember spending a couple months trying to figure out what my exact role was on the team.

What I ended up doing was every job that was left. Including things that I personally wished the team, or management had done for me during my time as a head coach. So if there were management-bound interferences that were about fall onto the ground-level, I would step in as Director/Supervisor and stop it. I guess you could think of it as the guy that takes care of anything that could result in conflict or discomfort when it comes to interactions between the management, head coach, coaches, and players.

You could say that this is the job description of the General Manager. But the thing with HLE was that there was already an existing GM in the main HLE HQ, so they couldn’t exactly give me an overlapping title. So I ended up being a sort of middleman or arbitrator between the HQ and LoL team, and a guy with the title of Director/Supervisor that performs the job of an on-site GM.

**Ambition** **:** So someone that tries to create an environment where the head coach can focus only on game-related things.

**Kezman :** That’s what I was going for. Think about a situation where a head coach has to say some harsh words to a player. While tough love is necessary, players are, and will get their feeling hurt in the process. Even just a little bit. But once those schisms appear, it’s really difficult as a head coach to approach a player and make amends. So what I would do as a director/supervisor is be the polar opposite of the head coach. If the head coach was playing good cop, I would play bad cop. If the head coach was going stick, I’d go carrot. Vice versa.

**Ambition** **:** Don’t you also have to watch over other titles like Valorant as supervisor/head coach?

**Kezman :** But HLE only had 1 team, which was the LoL team at the time. There were pushes internally to expand to other titles, but the organization came to the decision to focus on LoL in the short term.

**Ambition** **:** I guess a more fitting English title for the job would be head-head coach, or main coach. Something like that.

**Chat :** The performance analyst ‘Bibra’ has been a part of the HLE coaching staff since 2021. Can you specify what he does for the team?

**Kezman :** He’s not a widely-known name in the industry, so I think some people could be curious as to what he does. So my first time working with Bibra was in 2018 RNG. Bibra was the performance analyst, and Heart was the coach. Back during 2018, I remember having a lot of disagreements and discussions with Heart when it came to things like draft. But Bibra would appropriately chime into those discussions with some very good ideas, to where his interventions and opinions were sometimes single-handedly responsible for us winning a game that happened just minutes after. He was not only a very through analyst, but also somebody that knew exactly what he needed to do for the team as performance analyst.

**Ambition** **:** So I still think people are curious as to what a performance actually does.

**Kezman :** It’s someone that needs to keep tabs on both the state his, and the opponent’s team is in. In terms of what we’re good at and what the opponent is good at. Within the coaching hierarchy, the head coach and coach doesn’t have enough time to watch and review every single game, right? So what the performance analyst does is review all of those games, organize and isolate relevant data, and relay it on to the coach and head coach. In a mock draft environment, he will be the one that will be telling us relevant information like the specific draft patterns, champion preferences, scrim data, SoloQ history of the opposing team.

While it’s an accompanying position, the role is extremely crucial. Like I said, the coach and head coach just doesn’t have the time to do all the things I mentioned above. In a schedule of accompanying players to stage games, providing feedback to those stage games, participating in scrims, doing VOD reviews, etc – the performance analyst does everything that the head coach and coach doesn’t have the time to do.

One thing that I had Bibra do during our time together was creating short, 5-minute videos that the players could watch. These videos would include things like crucial mistakes that were made in past games and specific ward locations that were collected after reviewing every single game. I would have Bibra make those videos, and I would then make the players watch those videos before they go play games on-stage.

**Ambition** **:** So it’s not a job or position that has that much exposure to the public.

**Kezman :** Right. It’s really hard to get a grasp of what a performance analyst actually does from an outside perspective.

**Chat :** The fans regard the 2022 development roster as something that took place because a larger grandiose plan during the offseason failed. Is this true?

**Kezman :** At least in my perspective, I do think that the ‘grand plan’ of the 21-22 offseason not working out is true. So the thing about 2022 was that my contract had also expired at the end of 2022, and I was still in the process of re-negotiating my contract with HLE while the off-season was taking place. So I wasn’t in the position to actively go out and pursue roster-related moves for the team. I ended up getting my contract renewed, but it was a bit too little too late. That’s at least my side of the story, where I feel I didn’t have the freedom to make the moves I wanted to make because I had arrived in the player market a bit too late.

**Ambition** **:** What was the 2022 HLE roster again?

**Kezman :** It was Dudu, Onfleek, Willer, Karis, SamD and Vsta.

**Ambition** **:** How did you guys do?

**Kezman :** 10th in both Spring and Summer, of course. It was a full, 5-man development roster. But I actually have a lot of love for this 2022 team, because all of the players really put their all into the 2022 season despite its hardships.

**Ambition** **:** So to summarize, the 2022 HLE roster didn’t go development mode and release all their existing players because you or HLE wanted to from the beginning. But it was a situation where it was too late for you to do anything by the time your contract for head coach had been renewed.

**Kezman :** Right. By the time my contract was renewed, the offseason was already over.

So what ended up happening in at the end of 2021 was us being eliminated in Worlds Quarterfinals by T1. Right around that time, I remember making a direct appeal to management that it would probably be best that the team try and re-sign key players like Chovy and Deft before heading into the 21-22 offseason. Well, Deft was a bit iffy, because he had already told the team that he was unsure about his future career due to military obligations and his back pains.

Ok. So one thing that’s really difficult about any offseason is deciding, and securing the player that’s going to be the basis of your team. Once that player is secured, that player will act as the centerpiece of your potential roster that you use to draw other players in.

**Ambition :** So something like a “Our Midlaner is Chovy, wanna come?” kind of thing.

**Kezman :** But what happens when you have no basis at all, is equivalent to a hard reset. You start from 0. It’s bad courtesy of me to mention player names, but I tried really, really hard to get Chovy and Deft again for 2022. Especially Chovy. Chovy was a player that I’ve had my sights on even before he went to DRX. I visited his family at his house in-person multiple times to try and persuade him. Long story short, I invested a lot of time and effort up to try and secure Chovy right up until he signed with HLE.

**Ambition :** One thing that some old-school fans need to know is that the value judgements of players have shifted with the increase in player salaries. Once we developed into an ecosystem where every team just about pays a similar but large amount – players naturally became more inclined to value winning over extra money. So this inevitably leads to players asking “Who am I playing with?” when being recruited. If you’re a GM or team that doesn’t have a good answer to that question, that player is most likely going somewhere else that does.

**Kezman :** So assuming that the free agent in question is a high-tier player, multiple teams are going to have similar offers in terms of salary. So in a situation where that player is choosing between different teams with similar financial incentives, the next point of comparison will always be the roster. So the better your ‘basis’ player is, the higher chance that you’ll have of attracting and branching out players of a similar level around him.

I’m not sure if this is OK to say, but even I was considering offers from different teams at the time. Because I was in a position where the industry and public views me as the person responsible for strategizing the team’s offseason, but I was not in a position to do so because I was still in limbo of re-negotiating my own contract. So there was an incentive for me to not consider HLE, because I knew that by the time I did renew my contract with HLE, it would be too late. That would result in me being the recipient of hate and responsibility for ‘failing’ the offseason, which I didn’t want.

**Ambition :** I feel like this was a situation where you could have brought in the press and tried to sway public opinion.

**Kezman :** That’s not a good idea. HLE is a company that uses sports as the primary means of spreading and elevating their corporate image to the public. So the image of the team is equivalent to the reputation of not only HLE, but the Hanwha Group as a whole by association. So there’s no reason for me to sour my relationship with Hanwha, or try to save my own skin by driving Hanwha into the dirt. If I did, I would just be tarnishing my own reputation in the process. And besides, assuming responsibility and tanking public aggro is part of my job as head coach – so it was only right that I did so.

**Chat :** Is it true that both Rookie and Mata could have joined CJ Blaze?

**Kezman :** Partially. So this goes back to a fanmeet that we hosted at Shindorim with both the Blaze and Frost roster. We had different players form teams with fans and play each other. Rookie was on Rapidstar’s roster, and he put on a pretty awe-inspiring show with LeeSin. I remember talking to some of the people on CJ about it, and how this kid was a good player. But we never gave it any second thought, because it was only just a fanmeet event match.

I guess that could count as Rookie almost joining Blaze. But I do remember being quite interested in him, where I went up to him in person to ask his SoloQ rank, and whether or not he was interested in going pro. I’m not sure about Blaze.

**Chat :** I’m joking, but remember 8 years ago where you said on NiceGameTV that you wouldn’t recruit Faker because you already had Ambition and RapidStar on your team. If you could go back in time, would you say something different?

**Kezman :** As a coach, it’s part of my job to prop up my players whenever I can. It would be wrong for me to say, “Oh, I’d get rid of Ambition and Rapidstar for Faker because he’s better” in an official interview, of all things. That’s just wrong. I gotta look after my own boys, not some other guy’s kid. Best I can say is acknowledge that the other guy’s kid is pretty good, but also rep my boys by saying they’re just as cool.

**Chat :** Okay, but what if you really had the chance to recruit Faker? (As a joke, of course)

**Kezman :** If I could, of course I would. Heck, if it meant I had to switch teams over to wherever Faker was at, I’d go. We’re all people, c’mon.",59,1758076680.0,leagueoflegends,6,0.95,False

1nj1d2u,https://i.redd.it/5nsayxqd0npf1.jpeg,"How to Clean, Condition, and Maintain Your Home Theater Leather Seating (For Any Brand)","Proper care of your home theater leather seating helps it stay comfortable, luxurious, and long-lasting. Here’s a professional yet practical guide to keeping your seating in top condition.
 
1. Weekly Dusting and Light Cleaning
 
Wipe your seats with a soft microfiber cloth to remove dust and surface dirt.
 
For small spills, lightly dampen the cloth with distilled water. Avoid soaking the leather.
 
Use circular motions rather than scrubbing in straight lines to maintain the finish.
 
Why it matters: Even genuine leather can accumulate dust that dulls its look or creates micro-scratches over time.
 
Common Mistake: Using rough cloths or household cleaners can leave marks or strip natural oils.
 
2. Monthly Deep Cleaning
 
Use a pH-balanced leather cleaner or mild soap solution suitable for genuine leather.
 
Lightly dampen a cloth with the solution and gently wipe the surface.
 
Follow with a clean, damp cloth to remove residue, then dry immediately with a soft towel.
 
Tip: Always test cleaners on a hidden area first. Harsh chemicals can damage the leather finish and make it appear dull.
 
3. Conditioning (Every 3–6 Months)
 
Apply a lightweight leather conditioner designed for home furniture. Avoid heavy oils or waxes.
 
Rub a small amount into the leather using circular motions.
 
Let it absorb for 20–30 minutes, then buff with a dry cloth.
 
Why it helps: Conditioning restores natural oils, keeping leather soft, supple, and resistant to cracking.
 
Common Mistake: Over-conditioning or using thick waxes can leave a sticky surface or cause uneven darkening.
 
4. Cleaning Spills and Stains
 
Promptly addressing spills and stains helps prevent permanent damage. Different types of stains require slightly different approaches:
 
Liquid spills (water, soda, coffee, juice):
 
Blot immediately with a soft, clean cloth—never rub. For sticky residues, lightly dampen the cloth with distilled water and blot until clean.
 
Oily or greasy stains (food, butter, lotions):
 
Sprinkle a small amount of cornstarch or talcum powder on the spot to absorb the oil. Let it sit for 15–30 minutes, then gently brush it off and wipe the area with a lightly damp cloth.
 
Ink or dye stains:
 
Use a leather-safe ink remover or a specialized leather cleaner. Always test on a hidden area first. Apply sparingly and gently, avoiding aggressive scrubbing.
 
Food crumbs or dry debris:
 
Use a soft brush or vacuum with a soft brush attachment to remove particles. Avoid pressing hard, which can embed debris into the leather texture.
 
Pro Tip: Quick action is key. The longer a spill sits on genuine leather, the more it can penetrate and alter the surface. Avoid alcohol, harsh detergents, or abrasive tools—they can damage the leather finish.
 
5. Preventive Care
 
Keep seating out of direct sunlight to prevent fading.
 
Maintain moderate indoor humidity (40–60%) to avoid drying or mildew.
 
Avoid placing sharp objects or heavy items on the leather.
 
Scientific Note: Genuine leather absorbs and releases moisture; controlling the environment preserves its softness and appearance.
 
6. Choosing Products
 
Cleaners: pH-balanced, non-toxic, labeled for leather furniture.
 
Conditioners: Lightweight, non-greasy, designed for home leather; avoid heavy waxes or petroleum oils.
 
Common Mistake: Multipurpose cleaners or abrasive scrubbing can remove the protective finish or damage leather fibers.
 
With regular care, your genuine leather home theater seating will stay soft, comfortable, and visually appealing for years. Light weekly cleaning, monthly deep cleaning, periodic conditioning, and prompt attention to spills and stains protect your investment while avoiding common mistakes that can shorten its lifespan.",1,1758076610.0,weilianda,0,1.0,False

I'm not entirely sure what to do about my relationship with my best friend, which feels like it's on the rocks. To start, I am 100% anxiously attached (in general). I've been doing therapy, and I think I can see some slow progress, but I still feel like I'm at the beginning of the process. I'm becoming aware of my patterns, though, and how they relate to my childhood.

I'm also fairly confident that my best friend is avoidant, based on how he's talked about his cold and distant father, himself, and other people, and just based on what I've seen since knowing him.

Anyway, my best friend and I started out really close. We met online, and then became IRL friends. I will admit, we are (were?) friends with benefits, but he was definitely more friend than benefits. I had always assumed the friendship was fairly deep, but now I'm not so sure.

To be vague enough to have plausible deniability, this friend hasn't been showing up for me much for most of the last year. He'll make vague commitments to do things, and then those things will never happen. Or worse, he'll suggest planning something, sometimes things that require tickets or reservations, and then follow up with me at the very last minute.

He ""values independence and freedom"", and definitely seems to live his life on his terms, even when it inconveniences other people, in ways that are entirely selfish. I'll spare the specifics, but he made me miss a really important event we had planned together months ago because he stayed out too late the night before and, instead of rearranging his day to accommodate me, kept his usual schedule and we missed the event.

This is triggering the hell out of me, but I'm also starting to rethink the friendship. He does this kind of thing a lot, and it's really disrespectful. Meanwhile, he seems to be able to manage scheduling things that _he_ wants to do just fine. It all just feels really one-sided, which isn't necessarily an avoidant thing

I've been pulling away a bit this week after a similar painful experience this past weekend. I will explain to him this week what's bothering me, but mostly as a courtesy; I really don't think anything is going to change. (I have extra therapy this week, too, just for this lol.) I really don't know how he processes _his_ emotions, though, so that might be a wildcard, too. In the past, though, when people present him with conflict, he just gets dismissive and seems kind of annoyed with them. I feel like I need a few weeks apart from him, though, either way.

I've considered kinda ""downgrading"" the friendship, and suggesting that we just do easy things like coffee or hanging out, low-stakes things that can be arranged at the last minute, but that feels like losing a part of myself. I don't know if I can care _less_ about this person; it feels like it has to be all or nothing. I don't want a superficial friendship with him, and I'm afraid because I think that is how he conducts _all_ of his relationships. He won't even commit to the man he loves; what hope is there for me?

Anyway. Anyone have any advice, I guess? Can APs and DAs be close friends? Do I need to disengage completely to protect myself? Thanks for listening.",1,1758076494.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

They told me it wouldn’t work because the bottle sits higher than the machine, so the milk could siphon out. My idea was to place the fridge in the cabinet/bench *below* the machine.

Does anyone know if the Jura’s pump can handle pulling milk upwards from a fridge sitting below counter height? Or is this going to cause issues with flow/head pressure?

I’m 20 and i’m experiencing thinning of my hair, hair loss and hair fall, receding hairline, and pimples and patches on my scalp that itch. My scalp itches throughout the day and I also have dandruff. 

The pimples and eventual bald patches started I THINK when i was around 14. I had so much thick hair back then I didn’t really care. I think I would only have a few patches every year, but I’m not really sure. These patches most happen on the sides of my head and around the back. Since then, they’ve pretty much mostly all grown back I think.
I never noticed thinning of my hair and receding hairline really until I was around 17 or 18. That’s when i realized that my scalp would itch, my hair was falling out, it was thinning, and my hairline was receding. I also would still get pimples that itch and eventually turn into bald patches.
My parents made me go to the doctor when I was around 18 and they just said it was from stress and prescribed me a topical cream to grow the patch I had back, and i’m pretty sure it didn’t really work at all. They grow back eventually anyways for me mostly. 
I’m 20 now and it’s still the same. But now it’s getting to a point where I’m not the only one who notices it. 
Please help me. I want to grow my hair back and make my hair and scalp normal again so bad.
Some things i’ve noticed that make it worse I THINK are eating junk food and gluten. It might be placebo but i think it makes the itching and hair loss worse. 
I eat extremely clean for the most part, eating mostly meat and fruit and some veggies. I eat dairy occasionally and try to avoid grains and legumes mostly. I drink tea and coffee ocassionally, mostly tea. 
I have a reverse osmosis shower filter. 
Red light therapy i think seems to help speed up growing back the patches but that could possibly be placebo as well. 
Certain things like certain oils/shampoos I think break it out more i THINK.
I use a very clean shampoo and conditioner.

My only “health history” is that when I was a preteen/early teen, I had self-diagnosed malassezia folliculitis. I believe I had this because my symptoms were flesh colored bumps on the oily spots on my face (mostly forehead). it cleared up using Nizoral shampoo, but then it got used to the Nizoral and came back a little bit. I still have a little bit on my forehead sometimes but it’s not quite as bad. 
I’m wondering if the scalp pimples are fungal related as well? I’m not sure. But i’m not sure if Nizoral would work since I think my body has built a resistance to it. 

Please help me anyone🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼with remedies, cures, suggestions, or any possible diagnosis or idea what is causing all of this!!!!

One plan is to join a police department in whatever city I end up choosing or state and then from there work for a little bit and then obviously my end goal is my coffee shop but it depends how soon I get to do that. If I get married then I can't do it as soon and stuff like that but that was one plan and another plan was to join the army or not the army the military for a little bit and use that as a stepping stone same as what I'm doing in plan A but this plan would bring me free school and a whole lot of benefits but my whole reason for not wanting to go to school is because school is expensive so I would have free school with that plan



 most of my family agrees and they want me to to join the military but it's my sister who doesn't want me to do that to myself and just because like obviously America you know kind of have a little bit of a bad rep and plan B would also include the coffee shop later on so that's my end goal either way but it depends how I'm going to do it because if I do plan A I would I would try to find a roommate in whatever city I end up choosing or state and apply to the the local police department police department and work over there



 without having to pay full rent because I have a roommate and then from there I could just keep working and saving and then then do that so I'm kind of leaning towards plan A but because I don't know I feel like we might go to war soon and I don't know if plan B is the best option but I'm not sure what I should do any advice.

This is a Long post about Sexual Transmutation and the invisible forces that hinder it.*



# AUTOMATICITY : THE MECHANISM OF OBEDIENCE

Human Body is evolved to reduce load.

Repetitive cognitive load causes Neurons to fire together and wire together which develops automaticity/habits.

Thanks to that, we can multitask. However, it's not just Neurons, environment plays a role in this too. 

**Environment acts as stimulus for certain automatic neural impulses.** 

1. Old songs and Music can make you feel nostalgic.

2. Fresh Cut-grass can bring childhood memories back.

3. Even your favorite song, when set as Alarm Ringtone can start irritating you.

***With enough repetitive exposure to specific environmental cues: YOUR EMOTIONS CAN BE MANIPULATED THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT.***

With repetition, This automaticity becomes so efficient that it starts happening WITHOUT your intellectual consent.

Just like a Dog that can be trained to perform tricks with treats, 

A human can be trained as well using treats of dopamine instead. 



Give it enough dopamine and repetition, this AUTOMATICITY WILL OVERRIDE your WISHES. YOU LOSE CONTROL OVER YOUR BODY and MIND. 

Give it decades, it WILL HAPPEN regardless of your choice. **Choice becomes an illusion.** 

**When you are Compelled by this cycle of doom, you become the perfect CONSUMER, the perfect Product.** 

**An obedient Slave fattened on Dopamine, engineered for profit, happily milking himself dry off of his finances and nutrients night and day.** 

**He does this under the mantra ""Live and let live"".**

**""As long as I am not hurting anyone, I can do whatever they want""**

**Even some long term retainers are trapped in Dopaminergic environments that offer artificial surges of dopamine preventing Sexual transmutation.**

 

# Automaticity + Dopamine | The Man Killing Combo

[This study and a 1000 other studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3462342/) show how addictions EAT AWAY YOUR BRAIN's ABILITY TO QUESTION THE ADDICTION ITSELF.

DOPAMINE ADDICTIONS WILL MAKE A PROPER SLAVE OUT OF YOU. 

# ""You will own nothing and still be happy.""  

# ~World Economic Forum (2016) 

Translation: 

***""We will strip you of ownership, keep you dependent on our systems for everything, and drug you with comfort and convenience AND you WILL mistake slavery for happiness.""***

The Technology is only getting started.

**YOU** **~~WILL~~** **ARE LOSING THE ABILITY TO QUESTION THE HABITS THEY ARE FORCING UPON YOU WHILE MAINTAINING PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY.**

**DOPAMINE ADDICTION IS THE DISEASE THAT TELLS YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE IT.**

This is the reason why r/Semenretention does not have more members. 

Majority of men are in denial.

*- ""There's No scientific proof, no empirical evidence that SR works.""* 

*- ""Oh, its just placebo.""*

Without ever giving it a fair chance. Because porn has encroached upon their Prefrontal Cortex, their self-awareness, taken control of their higher order executive control like a parasite and tells them its okay to watch porn. 

Until the stars align and they find a woman ready to have sex with them and they cannot get it up when the time demands. At that moment, truth is laid bare. But it's too late.

Even us, long term retainers are guilty of self sabotage. We have our own vices. We write things off without giving them a fair chance. 

What most of us are scared of here is, **the Void.** 

We quit a bad habit and a **time void** appears. That void will ALWAYS be filled. 

If logic doesn’t choose how, YOUR LIMBIC BRAIN will. 

Majority of us just Fire one addiction and hire another. At the end we still end up paying.

Most of us here Never give Dopamine Fasting a chance. We write it off and say SR alone is good enough. 

Unbeknownst to them that Dopamine Retention + Semen Retention is the ultimate God Hack.



# REINFORCED BY ENVIRONMENT

***Now that we know that Automaticity is the PRIMARY driver of relapse.***

 **We need ot know how it is weaponized.** 

**-PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY:** 

**The dopamine trainer aka the Elites wear the cloak of anonymity, where will you point fingers if you don't know them? Who will you blame? If its overt psychological operation, you will be stand on Guard, you will rebel. If they keep a low profile with just Temptation ever-present, That gives you an illusion of choice. Only you are to blame.**



**-AVAILABILITY AND CONVENIENCE OF ONLY THE ADDICTIVE things:** 

 **like Caffeine, junk food is available in EVERY SINGLE TOWN no matter how small it is. Paying for stuff is easier and quick. One click and you are subscribed. One click and you can order stuff.**

**-FRICTIONLESS ACCESSIBILITY:** 

**Pay attention to how everything that's bad for you is frictionless, absolutely no barriers to impulsivity. Drive thru is only for junk food, alcohol, coffee, donuts and other trash not for Steamed Broccoli/Kale.** 

Pay attention to how everything around you is Sexualized to the point that YOU CANNOT BLOCK ALL FEMALES ON INSTAGRAM/TIK TOK. YOU HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS AND ADD a MILLION HASHTAGS to avoid watching any nudity on these apps.

THERE ARE NO 3rd-PARTY apps that help sort content according to gender and content. 

The only option remains is to give it up altogether.

>!They are even designing Women's clothing to be as perverse as possible. It is literally engineered to attract Male attention.!<

>!Never ever believe anyone who says ""I am wearing this for myself, to feel confident""!<

>!What does Confidence have to do with having your Breasts appear bigger than they are?!<

>!What does Confidence have to do with your waist appearing smaller than it actually is?!<

>!However, When a woman wears Push up bras, hides her acne behind make up, it's NOT insecure.!<

This disparity means there is a deep social programming that is aimed to harvest ONLY male attention.

**Behavior is the language of truth. Don't ever believe their words, only their actions.** 

This applies for self accountability too, Don't ever believe your own words, watch what you do. Keep a check on your time. Watch your ""Screen Uptime Activity"" and trust it more than your own words. 

**Past Behavior is a much better predictor than future expectation of behavior**  
  
**Past Behavior >>> Future Intent of Behavior**



# Solution:



After Covid-19, the company I worked for posted a 30% increase in average annual revenue.

I was in sales so obviously I was very happy until we had an annual financial meeting.

The analysts in the meeting basically said:

Statistically speaking, a huge 30% increase means an external factor has been applied to a data set forming an unprecedented result.

**A CHANGE OF 30% IS STATISTICALLY EXTRA ORDINARY AND NOT REPLICABLE UNDER THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL conditions. Our products were the same, the B2B and B2C model was the same, we did not do ANYTHING extra that would increase the revenue.**



**In layman's terms, UNLESS THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGES, THE PROBABILITY OF DURABLE CHANGE IS almost ZERO.** 

**YOU NEED TO IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULUS THAT ARE KEEPING YOU IN THE HABIT LOOP AND UPROOT IT FROM THE SOURCE.** 

**YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ADD ANYTHING TO FOCUS, YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THINGS TO FOCUS. CONSISTENCY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU ADD, IT IS UNMASKED AFTER YOU REMOVE ALL THE DIRT.** 

**When there is no choice other than to work on transmuting your sexual energy, consistency happens. You just have to deliberately block other choices.**



**Biologically: The neurological pathways have been reinforced for 10, 20, 30 years or more.** 

**These pathways are like river bed formed through water gushing and cutting rocks. It won't be reversed by mere intent.**

**Environmental Cues peppered all around us are designed to REINFORCE the release patterns. YOUR PHONE is the biggest threat to your biological imperative. It is ever present.**

**DURABLE CHANGE WITHOUT ALTERING THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT IS VERY RARE. IT TENDS TO ZERO in the world of Statistics.**

**IN GAMING TERMS: YOU GUYS NEED TO CHOP OFF ALL THE other side CHOICES IN THE DECISION TREE. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Put friction in the way of those choices. Strategize.**

The more barriers you set up between you and the addictive behavior the easier it will be to stick to that apparently boring project you were doing.

As your brain corrects your neurology, with time the boring things will becoming entertaining again.

Identify at least one dopamine source in your environment and get rid of it. It is costing you thousands of dollars, and tons of self confidence. It is feminizing you, making you inactive, unable to move, emasculating you. 

***30% change is actually more than enough to cause the snowball effect and take you places you would have never imagined. You can achieve ANYTHING you have EVER desired in your life.*** 

The only issue is The Horse comes before the cart. 

The SACRIFICE COMES BEFORE MANIFESTATION. 

That is the hidden covenant with God. 

Every temptation is a test in disguise, every pleasure you reject takes you closer to God and your deepest aspirations. 

Each temptation rejected transmutes into your Will Power. 

Each temptation accepted transmutes into unending temptations like the Hydra.

I have a good life and enjoy myself. I have hobbys I'm passionate about, no wife, no kids, no mortgage.
Something about 3 months ago  where I reviewed my finances and was absolutely shocked at the amount I spent eating out and going to coffee shops.
 Since then I have been doing meal prepping, I have 30 meals in the freezer right now. I make my coffee at home, buying things in bulk for way cheaper (have a mini deep freeze), making lunch everyday. Stopping Amazon spending on random usless shit. Basically just thinking way more about every purchase I consider. 
 I was sitting on my couch did a little bit of research and ended up creating a wealth simple account and opening up a TSFA. Since then I have invested $17,500 all into VEQT. It has been quite motivating to see it grow. 
I have $250 a week being automatically invested into veqt and my plan is to dump a chunk in once in a while once i build my emergency fund up to $20,000, currently at $8,000. I have no debt other than my truck and make sure I pay my credit card balance every month. I didn't even know what my credit score was so I checked that and it said it was 852 and I did some research and I guess that's good?
My job is very physical but I see myself crawling around on roofs and up ladders well into my fifties making good money as I am fit and eat healthy. 
I guess I'm just wondering if it's too late for me to be able to comfortably retire in my 60s.
I don't really know what retirement looks like to me and what the world will look like in 35 years.
Buying a home isn't a goal of mine. I understand it as an investment, but my goal in life is to deal with less stress and responsibility. I'm hoping I can still retire comfortably while renting.

I never noticed thinning of my hair and receding hairline really until I was around 17 or 18. That’s when i realized that my scalp would itch, my hair was falling out, it was thinning, and my hairline was receding. I also would still get pimples that itch and eventually turn into bald patches.
My parents made me go to the doctor when I was around 18 and they just said it was from stress and prescribed me a topical cream to grow the patch I had back, and i’m pretty sure it didn’t really work at all. They grow back eventually anyways for me mostly.

Please help me. I want to grow my hair back and make my hair and scalp normal again so bad.
Some things i’ve noticed that make it worse I THINK are eating junk food and gluten. It might be placebo but i think it makes the itching and hair loss worse. 
I eat extremely clean for the most part, eating mostly meat and fruit and some veggies. I eat dairy occasionally and try to avoid grains and legumes mostly. I drink tea and coffee ocassionally, mostly tea. 
I have a reverse osmosis shower filter. 
Red light therapy i think seems to help speed up growing back the patches but that could possibly be placebo as well. 
Certain things like certain oils/shampoos I think break it out more i THINK.
I use a very clean shampoo and conditioner.

My only “health history” is that when I was a preteen/early teen, I had self-diagnosed malassezia folliculitis. I believe I had this because my symptoms were flesh colored bumps on the oily spots on my face (mostly forehead). it cleared up using Nizoral shampoo, but then it got used to the Nizoral and came back a little bit. I still have a little bit on my forehead sometimes but it’s not quite as bad. 
I’m wondering if the scalp pimples are fungal related as well? I’m not sure. But i’m not sure if Nizoral would work since I think my body has built a resistance to it. 

Please help me anyone🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼with remedies, cures, suggestions, or any possible diagnosis or idea what is causing all of this!!!!

Been a member for years but this is actually my first post.  
What I like about reddit is the authenticity, I don't have to put on a fake persona, so I come cap in hand with my truth.

Another startup, I've been at this one for a while, a ton of iterations and failures but this one is close to my heart. I guess I'm trying to channel a little childhood abandonment trauma into something useful. Sort of like Batman minus the billions, gadgets and vigilante beatings.. **My gut and data both say its the right time** the urge that won't die so hey.

Looking around, the world's a fucking mess right now:

Silicon Valley can't fix homelessness in their own backyard but wants to ""change the world""

Gen Z and alpha's future looks bleak as hell and they kinda no it.

Power and resources keep centralizing to the same handful of people

War is looking inevitable. I'm not even sure who were supposed to be fighting, is it the Russians, Chinese, Aliens or ourselves.

Then there AI, we'll get into that at some point.

But hey, we'll ""own nothing and be happy"" apparently

My favourite quote of all time and a statement that sums it all up is Dr. E.O. Wilson's:

# ""The real problem of humanity is we have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology.""

It's perfect as it just sums the whole shitfest up. We're out of balance.

DLT Cafe is my humble attempt to try and shift the needle. Get us working together like ants instead of crabs in a bucket.

I don't have all the answers - nobody does, but I have a plan and I am certain of three things:

1. **Together, anything is possible.**
2. **If you don't set a destination you wont know where your going.**
3. **The hive mind always wins.**

It's 8 hours later and her chest/armpit on that side is sagging. Is that ok? Or normal? They said we might notice it settles in her leg(s) but I just want to be sure. She's got some loose skin from weight loss so I didn't notice it until she was walking on the back of the couch over my head.

She's been sleeping and eating today, and she's a little off balance since the fluids. Still able to jump onto and off of the couch/coffee table.

We aren't supposed to give more fluids until Thursday so we shouldn't overload her. This is just the first time this has happened so I don't know how long it's supposed to take for fluid to disburse? Is 8 hours too hasty? She's a tiny girl.",2,1758075496.0,RenalCats,4,1.0,False

1nj0ycy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nj0ycy,Please help me figure out the cause of this hair loss,"PLEASE HELP 
I’m 20 and i’m experiencing thinning of my hair, hair loss and hair fall, receding hairline, and pimples and patches on my scalp that itch. My scalp itches throughout the day and I also have dandruff. 

The pimples and eventual bald patches started I THINK when i was around 14. I had so much thick hair back then I didn’t really care. I think I would only have a few patches every year, but I’m not really sure. These patches most happen on the sides of my head and around the back. Since then, they’ve pretty much mostly all grown back I think.
I never noticed thinning of my hair and receding hairline really until I was around 17 or 18. That’s when i realized that my scalp would itch, my hair was falling out, it was thinning, and my hairline was receding. I also would still get pimples that itch and eventually turn into bald patches.
My parents made me go to the doctor when I was around 18 and they just said it was from stress and prescribed me a topical cream to grow the patch I had back, and i’m pretty sure it didn’t really work at all. They grow back eventually anyways for me mostly.

Since we got here a month ago she would cry and say that she’s all alone. I have my friend here but I do spend most my time with him. That is bc she never wants to watch what we want to watch. She said that I’m not a man that I don’t defend her against my other friends who are mean to her. I believe no conflict is best. She used to shower with me and we’d sleep naked together. She’d wait all day for me to come home and be sad if she wasn’t getting any attention. But recently she spends all day going to boutiques and coffee shops. She’s on the phone always with her friends. Dresses up just to go to the grocery store? Sleeps with clothes on and no longer showers with me. No kissing no hugs. Shes smiling and laughing but while talking to me it’s just like I bore her. How can she complain about feeling alone when she’s only making herself lonelier? Please help me understand.,1,1758075415.0,relationship_advice,8,0.6,False

I just wanted to say, thank you! The opinions, the debates, the analytical skills, y’all never cease to impress me, I lived for it all!

I have my alarm set for 5 AM, I will turn my coffee pot on, take my pups out, turn my little fall candles & lights on, then sink into my couch to catch the finale before work! I will save my shower for after so I can let the tears fall & the shower sound cloud my sobs as this finale completes the journey I started nearly a decade ago when I picked up the books for the first time!
