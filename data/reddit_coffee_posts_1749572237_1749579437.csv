I’m the guy behind the lens, chasing beauty in all its messy, unexpected glory. I live for those in-between moments—the smirk before the laugh, the glance that says everything, the kind of light that makes skin glow like it’s telling secrets.

Outside the frame? I’m your classic Irish rogue—tattooed, music loud enough to shake the walls, book in hand (probably with a half-drunk coffee beside it), and always up for an adventure, especially the kind that starts with “I probably shouldn’t…” and ends with a story worth retelling.

I crave deep convos, cheeky chemistry, and the kind of connection that makes the world fade out like the end of a good film. If you’re a fellow dreamer, night owl, or someone who knows there’s beauty in being truly seen—then maybe we’re overdue for a little spark of something.

Oh, and I absolutely swap pics—cameras are my thing, remember?

He puts himself on nearly all of my shifts, makes an effort to talk to me, remains respectful but genuine, and overall, he’s just a great person to be around. We’ve bought eachother coffee, have a couple good conversations each shift, and have gotten to know each other pretty well. 

That being said- I’m not sure if he has romantic feelings or just sees me as another employee. We have about 30 employees at the locations, and around 4-8 per shift. I’m usually working with him, but I’ve also made a lot of friends in the business. I noticed (and I’m sure he has too) that I talk to just about anyone with ease, but when it comes to him, I’ve gotten worse and worse with acting natural. 

I tense up, smile but can’t get words out, laugh at his jokes but don’t make my own (which is odd because I joke with everyone else), and stare at him but don’t interact. I love talking to him, but I can’t seem to show it. 

I dropped by yesterday with some friends and froze up when trying to talk to him. He was being very kind and talkative but I just couldn’t say a thing and now I’m starting to think he’s getting the idea that I don’t want to talk to him (or so it seems like). 

My plan: I decided I’m going to approach him next shift (4 days from now) and apologize for my lack of communication with him and explain that I do enjoy working with him, I’ve just had a hard time talking to him because he’s my boss and I feel some pressure. (While that isn’t the truth, I want him to at least believe that I appreciate his presence, because I really do.)

I’ve had a few somewhat personal conversations with him, but this is definitely the hardest. I found out he goes to my gym, which means I’ve been avoiding working out with the fear he might be there, and honestly, I just want this whole ‘crush’ thing to go away. I know he’s way too old for me and probably doesn’t view me the same way, but I don’t know how to make my feelings go away. Any advice on how to handle the conversation would be much appreciated :) ",0,1749579215.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

The number of guests your property sleeps should also be able to comfortably gather in the living and dining areas.

Some homes are definitely more challenging than others when it comes to maximizing seating in the living areas. (Side note: do bunk sofas exist? Because they should!

If your property falls into this camp, here are my favorite ways to add seating to a small living room:

1. ​[Ottomans & poufs](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vulz5xz6gh9h970xn0slhvmgn555snhdnzvz/3ohphkh39q7kr6hr/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5zaG9wbXkudXMvcC0xOTQxNjk2Mg==). Great for kids and versatile enough to double as footrests or even side tables. Select ones in colors that complement your decor style and pop in photos.
2. ​[Nesting coffee table](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vulz5xz6gh9h970xn0slhvmgn555snhdnzvz/48hvhehmq0r79pix/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5zaG9wbXkudXMvcC0xOTQxNzE4MQ==). Pull out seats as needed, tuck them away and they're gone!
3. ​[L-shaped sectional](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vulz5xz6gh9h970xn0slhvmgn555snhdnzvz/wnh2hghqvrwl44h7/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5zaG9wbXkudXMvcC0xOTQxNzQxMw==) vs. one with a chaise. When space is tight, no one gets to lie down and stretch out 
4. ​[Floor cushions](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vulz5xz6gh9h970xn0slhvmgn555snhdnzvz/reh8hohmvq0o7vt2/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNaWjgwR2E=). Kids love these, they can be stacked when not in use, and are a great way to add to your decor.

My reason for thinking this is basically in chapter 1vthe way you find the first egg is incredibly similar to how you find the mystery man in Undertale,

In chapter 2 if you found the first egg the man randomly appears in one of the cars before the cyber world and has the same way of finding it in the first chapter,

Chapter 3 has a convoluted way to find the egg but when you do but in this one he actually talks to you and rambles on quite a bit, Specifically he speaks in all caps like the voice at the start and whenever you get a game over who are already theorized to be gaster, but he also tell you in a convoluted way how to get the first five eggs

""On Thursday, I go to sell the donuts"" - Chapter One, just before the Bake Sale

""On Friday, I toss the leftovers in the dumpster"" - Chapter Two, the alley with the trash can

""On Saturday, I let it cool on the windowsill"" - Chapter Four, the entrance is a window

""On Sunday, I harvest the wheat"" - We don't know yet

And I'm pretty sure this is a cheeky nod from toby how people think the mystery man from Undertale looks like he's holding a donut and coffee,

And in chapter 4 if you found the third egg the man appears in the diner right before the dark world happily pointing to a takeout box presumably holding onto the egg you never got to put anywhere last chapter,

I haven't gotten to the chapter 4 egg yet but this is just my thoughts,

Granted, I have never had hot flashes, but the irregularity of periods over six years Lead to a roller coaster of emotions on a regular basis. I became so tuned of my body I was able to listen to it when there was that internal shift. I was vegan for nine years and loved that experience of nourishing myself with whole food plant based nutrition. However, once in my 40s and learning about perimenopause and how the body ages as females get older, I began to look at protein in a new way.

One day, I literally woke up craving salami, and so listened to this and started to research protein and perimenopause (it’s great people are talking about it more so we have this awareness however it concerns me that HRT is becoming the normal antidote because these are artificial hormones and you can actually change your hormones by adjusting other things in your life ) i became aware I could get more protein in a smaller amount of animal product without the extra fat and carbohydrates/sugars that will come through for example nuts… And I got tired of trying to hit even just 20 g of protein a day because I wasn’t a big fan of vegan protein shakes in my diet every single day or trying to consume enough edamame or peas from the plant based kingdom (and I am not such a great fan of tempeh) to get over the 20 g of protein a day.

By introducing a cup of Eden soy milk, which has 12 g of protein per cup, and which is the cleanest soy milk out there (they have been a company since the 60s) because I had learned for a woman in this stage it is important within the first half hour of waking up to get protein of some kind into your body. Now there are many options to do this, but I opted for this very clean soy milk, and it has kept me so much more balanced in my mornings. If we do not consume protein during that first 30 to 60 minutes of waking up, our cortisol levels go quite high and it doesn’t set us up for a good day - producing adrenaline and stress and other chemicals that throw us off our groundedness.

My breakfast consists of either (after the soy milk and coffee) a fresh green juice I make with dandelion (excellent for the skin) chard, kale, lemon, ginger, celery, and cucumber. Or I will make a smoothie from a cup of raw berries, frozen banana, hemp seeds (10 g of protein in 3 tablespoons) frozen spinach and water. For lunch, I may have a yoghurt (15 g of protein) or a tin of sardines on toast or tuna or salmon or chicken and a little bread and any vegetables I wish for dinner. I always end with a vegetable soup with or without bread or seeds on top - other lunch options are turkey slices or ham slices with 1oz of cheese and bread and vegan butter (just because I prefer the taste of vegan butter).

As long as the products are well sourced and organic, having not (the animal sources) been fed GMO‘s or issued hormones during their growth cycles. (unfortunately, I can’t eat eggs because I am allergic to eggs, they give me a rash) and then around these protein sources I have also added collagen powder - something I would never have dreamed of in my vegan days! But it’s unbelievable how stabilizing it is. In two scoops there  are 18 g of protein. I can add this to my smoothie or have it in a tea before going to bed. I also started making jellies (jello) as dessert (from a clean organic source) because I understand as you get older weight is easier to gain so I try and stay aware of my calorie intake as approximately as possible (after awhile, this is easy to eyeball) 

This awareness has caused a massive shift in my body and instability and moods, and I have no need to venture into the HRT world. Now this might not be right for everybody, but I really feel it’s important to address all the things one is putting in their body and this includes social media and your phone. (I also went off Instagram because it felt like a complete waste of precious time.) Keeping phone time to a minimum (sending emails checking emails ordering certain things I need) because the stuff you put into your brain through your eyeballs is just as important as the food you put in your mouth to feed the cells of your body as well. Becoming more emotionally aware by registering the feelings in your body, as well as anchoring through a groundedness at the same time (knowing that you can have a negative emotion as well as being grounded simultaneously) and massaging thoughts in a positive direction because humans are wired towards negativity! Is also helpful — moving the energy through the body by walking or yoga, or whatever form of movement one chooses also changes the chemicals in your body, and produces dopamine and serotonin, which are hormones in which helped regulate us females!  

I hope this post inspires other directions and a positive experimentation in looking for natural solutions in dealing with new crossroads - as us females venture through perimenopause and navigate this phase in life! ",1,1749578196.0,Perimenopause,0,1.0,False

It’s a very traditional area, and family gatherings are serious business. My grandmother is turning 75 next week and she’s throwing a classic Danish brunch at her house outside Aabenraa—open sandwiches, lagkage, strong coffee, and about 30 family members all packed into one room.

Over the last year or so, I’ve become more open about how I present myself. I still go by my name and most people use he/him, but I dress in a way that feels more natural to me—more feminine. I like soft sweaters, flowy skirts, subtle makeup, and delicate jewelry. It’s not about being shocking, it’s just about being comfortable in my own skin. It’s how I feel most like me.

My immediate family has had mixed reactions. My parents tolerate it but definitely don’t love it. My brother doesn’t say much but makes the occasional sarcastic comment. Most of my cousins have accepted it or just ignore it. In a small area like Sønderjylland, people notice anything different, and I’m definitely considered different.

Anyway, my mum told me about the brunch and asked if I could “please just dress normally” for one day. When I asked what that meant, she said, “You know—just wear jeans and a jumper, something simple. Not… a skirt.” I told her I wasn’t planning to wear anything wild, just a black maxi skirt, a neutral sweater, and light makeup. Still, she insisted it would be better if I “toned it down” so we wouldn’t be “the talk of the brunch.”

Then my grandmother called me herself. She wasn’t mean, but she said this brunch is very important to her and she didn’t want anything that would make her friends uncomfortable. She asked if I could wear “young man’s clothes” for the event and change into whatever I wanted after. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable pretending to be someone else just so a few older ladies wouldn’t whisper over their coffee.

She said that if I couldn’t respect her wishes, maybe it was better if I didn’t come at all.

So I didn’t. I dropped off a handmade card and a gift with one of my cousins the day before and stayed home during the brunch.

Now my mum is furious with me. She says I made it about myself and couldn’t just think of the bigger picture. My dad hasn’t said much but he clearly agrees with her. A few of my cousins messaged me saying they understood, but that “it probably would’ve been easier to just go along with it.”

For context: I’ve always been kind of hidden away in the family. My brother was the golden child—he got to shine, and I was the weird one, the “phase,” the one everyone didn’t quite know what to do with. This brunch wasn’t just some party to me—it was one of the only chances I had to show up as me, not as the version everyone else tolerates. I didn’t want to be loud. I just didn’t want to hide anymore.

Joe Stecher - a tough as nails standout amateur wrestler looking to turn pro.

Frank Gotch - the biggest name in pro wrestling.

Samuel Rachmann - a theater promoter who would take a turn in pro wrestling.

Jack Curley - a Chicago based promoter with bigger aspirations.

Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis - a young wrestler looking to make a name for himself.

Masked Marvel - am unkown wrestler named Mort Henderson,  who is offered a once in a lifetime opportunity.

As always, it's in chronological order, this one will kick off following Frank Gotch's voctory over George Hackenschmidt in 1911.

**1912 - 1913** 

Following Frank Gotch's second victory over George Hackenschmidt, Gotch continued to tour and defend his world title all over America throughout 1912, defeating names like Martin Plestina and ""Americus"" Gus Schoenlein.

Frank Gotch would officially retire, in what seems to be most reported as April of 1913, for seemingly the half dozenth time in the past five years. He would issue a statement, saying, ""Please announce positively that I am through with wrestling forever. My wife and myself have gone over the matter thoroughly and nothing will induce me to change my mind. The call of the foreigners and the offer of the big New York purses...$25,000 for three bouts...will never make me leave the farm again. I would suggest that Beell and Americus get together and then let the winner of this match defend the title. I will willingly waive my rights to the title in favor of the winner of the Beell-Americus match""

Professional boxing gained legitimate legal status in New York a few years prior, under 1911 Frawley Law, which allowed for fights up to ten rounds in clubs that posted $10,000 bonds with the state to guarantee honest fights. This saw boxing popularity take off and usurp pro wrestlings place in New York.

With Frank Gotch formally retired, the pro wrestling scene took a significant hit in popularity, with the biggest name worth mentioning in those years, being Joe Stetcher, who made his professional debut at nineteen years old, a year prior, in 1912. 

**The Next Generation**

Joe Stecher was a simple Midwesterner with a no-nonsense approach and a body said to have been made strong by his farm work. Stecher won his matches quickly and consistently, and was dubbed, ""The Scissors King"" in homage to his most popular hold, in which Stecher would trap his opponents chest between his legs and squeeze them to defeat. Jack Curley would be quoted on Joe, saying, ""Don't make any mistake on this fellow. I've been in the wrestling game many a year, and he's the greatest I ever saw-bar none.""

**1914**

Frank Gotch's recommended match of Gus ""Americus"" Schoenlein and Fred Beell for the vacant title would become official, and it would see ""Americus"" win the world title on March 13th, 1914, which he would hold for a few months before dropping it to Stanislaus Zbyszko on May 7th. Stanislaus Zbyszko made a name for himself in Europe the previous few years, as mentioned in my [post on Jack Curley.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wreddit/s/XEysiprVyc)

Stanislaus Zbyszko would hold the championship for a few months as well, before vacating the title to enlist in the Austro-Hungarian Army in October 1914, following the beginning of the first World War. Horrifyingly enough, Zbyszko would be captured in Russia during the first World War and spend six years incarcerated as a prisoner of war.

Back to the less bleak tale of pro wrestling though, Charlie Cutler would win the vacated championship ship on January 8th, 1915, after defeating Dr. Ben Roller for the prize. Cutler's reign wouldn't last long either though, eventually dropping it to that kid from Nebraska, Joe Stecher on July 5th, 1915, in front of a sold-out crowd at Rourke Park in downtown Omaha. On his loss, Cutler would be quoted saying, ""When he gets a body scissors on an opponent-good night-its like a giant boa constrictor. Frank Gotch cannot now, nor never could throw him.""

**Strangler**

Worth noting, while looking at the history of pro wrestling, would be Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis, from Wisconsin. While he was once quoted saying that he choose ""Strangler"" as an homage to the original ""Strangler"" Evan Lewis, Ed also said that he just liked the name. Whatever the case, Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis was fast becoming a popular young wrestler, having quit twelve hours per day job in 1909, to begin his career in pro wrestling.

He was still struggling to grow his name value when in 1914, he met an ambitious young manager named Billy Sandow. Sandow would share many qualities with William Brady, the one time wrestling manager behind Yusuf Ismal twenty five years prior. In fact, Billy Sandow actually met William Brady when Sandow was only twelve years old, and was so taken by Brady's flashy presence, that Sandow turned his own attention towards preforming and managing athletes. 

Billy Sandow saw big value in Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis if marketed correctly, and got to work immediately. Sandow had connections with local journalists around Chicago and made sure newspapers and reporters presented Lewis as a human rip saw, and marketed him as a violent and dangerous competitor. Having seen how Joe Stecher was getting the body scissors over as a signature move known to end matches, Sandow got to work putting over a signature headlock for Lewis where he would squeeze the air out of his opponents.

**1915**

With his popularity growing to massive heights, it only seemed fitting for Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis to challenge Joe Stecher for the world title, and that bout took place in October of 1915, in Evansville, Indiana. The bout lasted over two hours and was so slow paced that it drew boo's from the crowd. Eventually a frustrated Stecher charged Lewis, sending him crashing to the ringside area and onto a chair. Despite the doctor on-hand declaring Lewis as fine and ""fit to continue,"" Lewis would forfeit anyways and later claim to have sustained a groin injury from the fall. 

The mayor of Evansville would declare the match a ""fake"" and seized the gate receipts. Though the bout was declared a dud, it didn't change public perception much as there were immediate calls for a re-match. Though that would have to wait until the following year.

Stecher was the first world champion to be widely recognized as a genuine world champion across all of America, since Frank Gotch. Stecher didn't have the same name value as Gotch, though considering pro wrestling popularity was usurped by pro boxing over the previous three years.

Boxing exploded in popularity, with the implementation of the Frawley Law and the undefeated championship reign of Jack Johnson, which lasted over two thousand days, leaving pro wrestling with very little popularity or growth. It wasn't until the first World War started that things would change for the pro wrestling scene. By late 1915, a score of top-flight foreign wrestlers who had fled to America during the early days of the War, were ready to make a splash in the American market. They just needed a promoter who could see the potential. 

**Rachmann's Tournament**

That promoter, would be former actor, turned theatre promoter, Samuel Rachmann. Samuel Rachmann is a name most wrestling fans will have never heard of, but almost every wrestling fan has felt the influence he left on the business. Rachmann would host a wrestling tournament in New York, featuring an all-star cast of world wide talent, and he planned for it to be grander and more ambitious than any tournament the city had ever seen before.

Rachmann, having successfully promoted theatre's and concerts in Europe, wanted to bring that grand flavor to the States for this event, and planned twelve consecutive weeks of nightly wrestling shows at the 3000+ seat theatre, the Manhattan Opera House. Thats right, nightly shows gor twelve straight weeks inside a 3,000 seat venue. 

In early November 1915, Rachmann was quoted in the New York Times, hyping up the event, ""Swedes, Finns, Turks, Greeks, Poles, Huns, Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, French, Germans, Swiss, Danes, English and Americans will compete!"" Rachmann even promised each preformer a weekly salary, something unheard of at the time. Though the starting salary was only $100 per week, with only the top guys earning a percentage of the gate.

I'm assuming some of you may be remembering how Gotch got over as the American hero besting the foreign menace Hackenschmidt, and now wondering why Rachmann would go all in on an international tournament. It's worth considering that between 1900 and 1914, more than thirteen million people arrived to the country, with a large portion finding home in New York, and this influx of people continued for over a decade and only doubled and tripled at the start of the first World War. America, and New York in general, was filled with folks from all over Europe at this point. 

Rachmann seemed poised to win over the theatre going crowd in New York with Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis, who preformed in the tournament, recalling that ""it seemed to be a show conducted by an artist, with artists, for artists."" 

Rachmann seemed to be creating a card that would better resemble something Vince McMahon Jr would later be known for. Rachmann judged his performers based on their ability to excite a crowd and arranged each evenings card in a way that gave it variety, mixing the more serious matches on the same show that also featured matches designed 100% around comedy. Some wrestlers would chase each other around the ring and fight into the wings of the opera house, others would stamp their feet out of frustration when they lost a bout, and it seemed like more so than what came before, this show resembled what we see today. The goal of each wrestler in the tournament seemed to be sports entertainment-infused. Here are several examples of wrestlers in the tournament.

You had one wrestler named Sulo Hevonpaa, who would drape his elegant robe over a chair at ringside, before his opponents would wipe their boots off on it. 

The near-four hundred pound French wrestler, La Colosse made broad pleas to the referee in his over exaggerated accent, as the audience laughed at his inability to communicate. 

""Farmer"" George Bailey had a gimmick that would make Jim Cornette's head explode. Bailey claimed he could hypnotize his opponents and did just that on one match, convincing his opponet to run around the stage like a maniac. 

Greek wrestler Dimitrios Tofalos, was a former Olympic weightlifter, who would come to the ring dressed in a tuxedo, where he would sing opera before changing into his wrestling gear.

One show ended when the curtains above the ring fell mid-match and onto two wrestlers who refused to break their holds. As the theatre staff extinguished the lights and the patrons filed out of the building, they could still hear the two wrestlers groaning in the dark, seemingly still holding onto one another. The Brooklyn Times Union's John Fleeson would wrote about these shows, saying ""It would be impossible to describe what occurs every night. Still, I can say, without fear of contradiction, that there is more genuine comedy and laughter in this tournament than in many play now running.""

Personal note: I've never been a big fan of comedy in wrestling and usually hate it to be honest, but I didn't realize silly shit like this was happening as far back as 1915. Next time I argue against the use of comedy (for my mind isn't changed) I will at least not cite old school wrestling as being above this horseshit. 

Unfortunately though, and has been my argument against comedy in wrestling, Rachmann's tournament struggled to fill seats as the weeks went on. Because comedy isnt sustainable as a long-term solution for filling seats, by the second month, Rachman was reportedly facing thousands of dollars of debt. Ever the showman, Rachmann would gamble even further before admitting defeat, by getting serious.

**The Masked Marvel**

Rachmann kept the tournament going and debuted a new name, and unknown man wearing a black hood with holes cut out for his eyes. This new masked man, was called the Masked Marvel by reporters and became an immediate hit as an unbeatable force in the tournament. The Masked Marvel would make short work of the four hundred pound La Colosse, the the roar of the crowd, and another time when his opponent tried to flee the venue, the Masked Marvl dragged him back to the ring so he could pin him.

The Masked Marvel never stayed long after his win, always quickly heading to the back, which only added to his mystique and aura. The boys in the back didn't even know who he was, as the Masked Marvel would always leave immediately after his matches. When the Marvel did mingle with the crowd, he was a pro who always knew what to say and put himself over. One time when asked what his name was, he told the fans, ""Call me Desdichado,"" referencing the legend of Ivanhoe. He would assure the fans that he has a very good reason for concealing his identity and promised it would all be revealed eventually, though that was all a bluff.

The Masked Marvel's popularity and impact on the tournament cannot be understated, as seats filled up significantly on nights he wrestled, with Rachmann noticing that on the nights Marvel competed, nearly half the seats would be filled with women. Seeing that many women in the stands was unheard for pro wrestling so of course Rachmann started to capitalize on the new found interest. Rachmann adopted a new slogan for the tournament: ""Dont cheat your wife, bring her along!""

Zoe Beckley was a writer for the Washington Post when she was assigned the task of coving the tournament, with her writing ""Every third person in the audience was a woman. I went to stay five minutes and remained there for three hours and a quarter, being then pried, reluctantly, from my seat. Don't ask me what it was all about. The funny part is that you don't have to understand it to enjoy it."" I absolutely love this quote, as it sums up how a non-fan can become immediately indoctrinated by the spectical of pro wrestling.

Worth noting is that The Masked Marvel was not the first masked wrestler in recorded pro wrestling history. The first one was actually all the way back in 1867, in Paris, France, where he got over for a short period besting many of the most well known wrestlers at the time. Many assume that Rachmann must have gotten the idea for the Masked Marvel from that first masked star, nearly fifty years prior. In fact, in the contract Marvel signed for the tournament, it gave Rachmann sole credit for the idea of the Masked Marvel.

Also worth noting in the same vein, would be Ben Atwood, who newspapers claim was the original visionary behind the Masked Marvel. Though Ben would later clarify and say the idea was given to him by Mark Leuscher. Leuscher was a theatre producer who had a hit of his own, years prior with a masked dancer in the Zeigfield Follies, whom he called ""La Domino Rouge."" Credit for choosing thebwrestler to be under the mask, apparently goes to Jack Curley, who had a relationship with Rachmann that was ""vague at best"" with Curley supposedly helping fund some of the tournament.

The man under the mask was Mort Henserson, a no-name wrestler from Altoona, Pennsylvania, who despite being pegged for such a significant role, was still being paid the bare minimum $100 per week. 

**1916**

In January, Henderson abruptly quit the tournament and informed Rachmann that Jack Curley had offered him more than ten times his weekly salary for one big match at Madison Square Garden at the end of the month. While Curley had lreviously set up shop in Chicago, he now found great interest on claiming a foothold in New York. His spot in Chicago would be snatched up by the aforementioned Billy Sandow.

Deapite being under contract, Henderson stopped showing up for his tournament matches and eventually Rachmann hit Henderson with an injunction, just two days before he was scheduled to main event Curley's Garden show.

Just like Jack Curley and Ole Marsh exposed the business in Seattle, five years prior, the resulting suit, which was reported on by all major New York papers, also exposed the business. The suit named Henderson as the Marvel and revealed that his contract with Rachmann called for Henderson to win and lose matches as directed. Luckily for Curley, who faced the prospect of replacing his main attraction on two days notice, both he and Rachmann were able to come to terms and the injunction was dropped. No details are given beyond the fact that Curley and Rachmann spent hours deliberating with their lawyers until some agreement was made between the two promoters.

On January 27th, 1916, Curley's Madison Square Garden show went as planned, with thousands in attendance for the main event that pitted the Masked Marvel Mort Henderson against the current world champion from Nebraska, Joe Stecher. Stetcher would dominate the best two of three falls contest, pinning Henderson in back-to-back falls in less than fifteen minutes. With this show a success, Curley had firmly established his own foothold in Manhattan, making the city his new base of operations going forward.

Rachmann finished his tournament, but without his star attraction, attendance bottomed out completely by the final show. Rachmann, seemingly having enough of pro wrestling, never attempted to get back into the wrestling business. Though he only spent long enough in the buisness to have a cup of coffee, his influence on the product going forward cannot be overstated. Judging by what we just read, Rachmann would have fit right in with a lot modern performers.

**The Dream Match**

Even though he had been retired for several years by 1916, the pro wrestling world wouldn't stop buzzing over the prospect of Frank Gotch challenging Joe Stecher for the world title that Gotch never lost. And just like Gotch-Hackenschmidt from years prior, there was a bidding war of sorts to be the one to land and stage the potential Gotch-Stecher bout. 

An unnamed Chicago promoter reportedly offered Gotch $25,000 for the fight, but Gotch refused unless he was paid at least $35,000. Jack Curley, having set up a home-base in New York, attempted to bring Gotch and Stecher to Manhattan, but Gotch refused, on the grounds that it would draw better if it's done somewhere in the Midwest. The winning bid, came from Gene Melady, a prominent promoter in Nebraska, who made a deal with Curley, thst would see both men hold the match in Omaha.

Gene Melady was a former amateur boxer and college football standout as part of Notre Dame's first football squad, after which he made a fortune dealing in livestock. Melady was able to entice both Gotch and Stecher into the offer, by promising to build a stadium in time to host the event on Labor Day. Another Labor Day payday for Gotch it would seem. Melady on the other hand, was hoping to make history with a $150,000 gate, which would be the biggest pro wrestling had ever seen up to that point. 

While Frank Gotch agreed to a seven month long tour to build interested in the bout, and get him back in ring shape, Joe Stecher was looking to bide his own time with a rematch the fans were clamoring for.

**Stecher vs Lewis II**

On July 4th, 1916, in Omaha, Nebraska, Joe Stecher once again got into the ring with ""Strangler"" Ed Lewis, in a match that is best remembered for miserable weather and miserable contest. It was an outdoor event, with a tarp to block the sun for the wrestlers, but the fans were stuck in the sweltering heat for a rematch that was over two hours long. 

Just like their previous encounter, this was a dull affair with Ed mostly looking to avoid all of Joe's attempts to lock up. Several locals had bet large sums of money that Joe would beat Lewis in under an hour, with some even betting that Joe would win two straight falls. Lewis's manager, Billy Sandow remembers this, later recalling how ""Those Nebraska chaps, loaded with Eastern money they had won previously on Stecher against some of the best in the country, had bet wildly."" When that first hour passed, and those bets turned into losses, many in the crowd turned hostile towards both competitors and started heckling and jeering the contest.

Gene Melady had set this bout up too, and despite the contest starting at 4pm, he didn't plan for it to go past sun down. So as the slow plodding match entered its third hour, and they began to lose daylight, Gene realized that they had no way to view the action. Gene actually got up and suggested they pause the match and resume it in the morning, but the crowd responded so negatively to the suggestion, that Gene immediately got crew to stand on ladders and hold lanterns.

The match was so boring, that the only moment of action happened when some kids lit off fireworks in the middle of the grandstand. Finally, after 9pm, referee Ed Smith shut the match down. Ed was quoted as hilariously saying ""In the name of humanity, the match is over."" Fans would later claim that there was maybe thirty seconds of actual wrestling during the five hour contest where Stecher and Lewis stayed locked up and slowly moved around the ring for hours. Brutal. The fans in attendance apparently threw garbage and bottles at the wrestlers following the end of the match.

**Gotch's End**

Just two weeks later, on July 18th, Frank Gotch arrived in Kenosha, Wisconsin for a public training match with Bob Managoff. Unfortunately, during their friendly skirmish, Gotch's foot became tangled between the two ring mats during a scuffle, and the speed of Gotch's movement snapped his left fibia. Gotch fell to the mat in legitimate shock and had to be carried out of the ring and into a waiting car. Bob Managoff would later recount this day, remembering how ""the people booed. They thought Frank was faking."" Reminds me of Bret Hart breaking his sternum, being unable to stand, but could hear several people in the front row calling him a fake.

Gotch headed back home to recover, and unfortunately his weight would drastically drop, eliminating any chance for the potential Gotch-Stecher bout. Frank Gotch's wrestling career, was effectively over.

Without a blockbuster bout, world champion Joe Stecher found himself in a rare moment of solace and peace. He was only twenty three years old, but he had been going hard in the pro wrestling game for the past four years. Stecher was able to get married and enjoy his honeymoon before being thrust back into the role of pro wrestlings reigning world champion. 

**Broken Lineage**

Stecher's first match back following his marriage, was on December 11th, 1916, in Springfield, Massachusetts. Stecher was facing a wrestler from Finland, who the locals had taken a shine to. Olin didn't expect to win but was hoping to put on an entertaining crowd for Olin's local fans. Stecher didn't get the memo, unfortunately and walked into this bout looking to fight for his life. 

For all his popularity with fans, Stecher had a reputation with the boys as being uncooperative, and on this night, John Olin and the fans of Springfield saw this first hand. The match was messy, with Stecher looking to quickly dispatch Olin and the challenger instead choosing to fight off literally every single attempt at offence from Stecher. The bout would finally end, several hours later, at past 1am, with Olin and Stecher outside the ring, and trading legit punches in the front row. A frustrated Stecher would just walk off and take a DQ loss.

Following his DQ victory over Stecher the prior year, John Olin started to proclaim himself as the real world champion, and even fashioned together a title he would tour in Canadian territories and defend. While Olin wasn't widely recognized as a world champion, and Stecher still held the physical belt, this is the start of this lineage getting muddled.

**1917**

Sticking with the legitimate world title for now, the reign of Joe Stecher would come to an end a few months later when Stecher returned to Omaha, this time challenged by Earl Caddock in a best two of three falls bout. The first two falls lasted several hours, and they called for a brief break, before the third fall, just after 2am. 

Stecher was said to be slumped, sitting in a chair in the dressing room, looking dazed with tears running down his face. Stecher's brother Tony and his managers Joe Hetmanek were with him and remember how Joe was tearfully telling Tony, ""I won't go back and you can't make me go back and nobody can make me go back."" 

Stecher's manager, Hetmanek, sent word back to the referee that Stecher was forfeiting the match. When the referee announced the result and announced Earl Caddock as the new world champion, the crowd erupted. Hetmanek would tell reporters the next day that ""Joe Stecher was not himself.""  

Stecher would later refute this version of events, instead claiming that he didn't return to the ring because he didn't know the match had resumed. I dont know how many people buy that one, and maybe Stecher himself didn't either, because Stecher took the loss as opportunity to dissapear for the wrestling scene for the next five months. The kid was burnt out, going hard like that for nearly five years must have mentally broke him that night.

Back to John Olin's false ""world"" title claim, Billy Sandow must have seen opportunity and arranged a big match between Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis and John Olin at the Chicago Coliseum on May 2nd, 1917. Sandow even arranged for a more frail looking Frank Gotch to act as special guest referee. Unsurprisingly, Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis would win the false ""world"" title in a best two of three falls contest in under three hours, and infront of 7,000 fans.  

Lewis would briefly drop that ""world"" title to Stanislaus Zbyszko's little brother, Wladek Zbyszko, later that year in June. This was just another short reign though, with Lewis winning the title back less than a month later, and I suspect this had to do with Jack Curley, who had big plans for Wladek. Before returning home at the start of the first World War, Stanislaus brought his younger brother to the States in 1913, and Jack Curley had plans to make him a star. 

As you can see the world title lineage gets a little messy. We already had John Olin drop a false ""world"" title to Lewis and soon after promoter Jack Curley fashioned himself another ""world"" title for the New York area, and in December of 1917 proclaimed Polish athlete Wladek Zbyszko to be the world heavyweight champion in pro wrestling. 

Worth noting, for his significance alone to the sport, would be the passing of Frank Gotch. Gotch passed away on December 16th, 1917, in his home in Humboldt, with his wife and four-year-old son by his side. He spent the final years of his life battling various health issues that would eventually be diagnosed as uremia, a poisoning of the blood caused by untreated kidney failure. Frank Gotch, was only forty years old.

That's a good place to stop here, considering the passing of Gotch and Curley's move to New York. The next part will show how promoters Curley and Sandow would volley for control of the wrestling world and detail the rise of of Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis into the biggest name in wrestling.

Below, you will find the title history as it's detailed here.

This title lineage began on December 12th, 1916, when John Olin defeated legitimate world champion Joe Stecher by DQ. Stecher never technically dropped the title, but Olin claimed to be a world champion from that point on, with several notable promoters like Billy Sandow willing to work with him.

Truthfully, I didn't even know why I didn't miss a single day when it came to taking my birth control pills. I guessed it was habit from when it actually mattered. She giggled as she leaned against the table......","**Chapter One**  
 Sweat dotted my brow. Tendrils of red hair clung to my neck. My legs felt like I'd been sitting in a sauna. I was pretty sure there was a waterfall of sweat coursing between my breasts, and that alone put my mood somewhere between slapping someone and pushing them in front of a trolley.  It was so hot and sticky humid that I was seriously beginning to believe that New Orleans was one of the seven circles of hell and the outdoor seating area of the Palace Café was the gateway. Or the waiting room. A fat drop of sweat slipped from the tip of my nose and smacked off my Philosophy of Human Person text, leaving a little damp circle in the middle of a paragraph I could barely see through the sheen of sweat blinding me.  I always thought the title of my class was missing an 'A' somewhere in there. It should be Philosophy of A Human Person. But oh no, that wasn't how Loyola rolled.  
  The small table rattled on its legs as a large iced coffee slammed down directly in front of my book. ""For you!"" As I peered over the top of my sunglasses, my mouth watered like I was one of Pavlov's dogs. Valerie Adrieux plopped into the seat across from me, her hand like a claw on top of my iced coffee. A mix of Spanish and African heritage, Val had an absolutely beautiful skin tone, a rich and flawless shade of brown, and she looked awesome in bright oranges and blues and pinks and every freaking color of the rainbow.  Like today, Val wore a loose, orange halter that defied gravity, a purple necklace, and as I glanced down, I saw a turquoise peasant skirt. She looked as if she had stepped off a catalog featuring urban chic. If I wore any color other than black, tan, or gray, I looked like an asylum escapee.  Sitting up straight, ignoring how the backs of my thighs stuck to the chair, I made grabby fingers at the iced coffee. ""Gimmie.""  She arched a brow. In the sunlight, Val's hair had a burnt auburn sheen to it. Pretty. Mine looked like a fire engine. Scary. No matter the level of humidity, her head full of corkscrew curls always looked great. Again, pretty. Between the months of April and November, the curl in my hair got lazy and turned into a frizzy wave. Again, scary as hell.  
  
  Sometimes I wanted to hate her.  
  
  ""Don't you have something else to add to that?"" she asked.  
  
  This was one of those times.  
  
  ""Gimmie . . . my precious?"" I added.  
  
  She grinned. ""Try again.""  
  
  ""Thank you?"" I wiggled my fingers toward the coffee.  
  
  She shook her head.  
  
  I dropped my hands in my lap with a tired sigh. ""Can you point me in the right direction of what you want to hear? Play a game of hot and cold or something?""  
  
  ""While I love that game most of the time, I'm gonna pass."" Lifting the iced coffee between us, she smiled broadly at me. ""The correct response would be, 'I love you so much for getting me iced coffee that I'd do anything for you.'"" She waggled her brows. ""Yeah, that sounds about right.""  
  
  Leaning back in my chair, I laughed as I kicked my legs onto the empty seat to my left, stretching out the muscles. The reason I was probably sweating so much was because I was wearing lace-up boots that ended just below my knees and it was like two-hundred degrees, but I was working tonight, and flip-flops really weren't conducive to getting the job done or hiding the things necessary to get said job done. ""You know I can totally just kick your ass and take the coffee, right?""  
  
  Val stuck out her lower lip. ""That's not nice, Ivy.""  
  
  I grinned at her. ""It's true though. I could ninja-kick your ass all up and down Canal Street.""  
  
  ""Maybe, but you would never do such a thing because I'm your best-est friend-est in the world-est,"" she said with another wide smile, and she was right. ""Okay. What I want isn't a big deal."" She moved the straw jutting out of the iced tea close to her mouth, and I groaned. ""Not at all.""  
  
  ""What do you want?"" My second groan was lost in the hum of foot traffic passing the café, and the sound of sirens most likely heading toward the Quarter.  
  
  Val shrugged one shoulder. ""I have a date Saturday night—a hot date. Well, hopefully a hot date, but Daniel has me on the schedule to work the Quarter, so . . .?""  
  
  ""So, let me guess."" I reached behind me, draping my arms over the back of the chair. Not the most comfortable position, but it helped me air out. ""You want me to take your shift in the Quarter . . . on a Saturday night? In September. Smack dab in tourist hell?""  
  
  Her head bobbed an enthusiastic yes. ""Please. Pretty please?"" She shook the iced coffee, and the chunks of ice rattled in the plastic container enticingly. ""Please?""  
  
  My gaze moved from her hopeful face to the iced coffee and stayed there. ""Sure. Why not? Not like I have a hot date.""  
  
  ""Yay!"" She shoved the coffee forward, and I snatched it out of the air a half second before she dropped it. A heartbeat later, I was slurping away happily, totally transported to a chilly, caffeinated heaven. ""You know,"" she began, placing her elbows on the table, ""you could have a hot date, if like, you went out on a date once every year or so.""  
  
  I ignored that comment and continued drinking at brain freeze speed.  
  
  ""You're really pretty, even with all that hair."" She made a circle with her hand in the general vicinity of my head as if I didn't know I looked like a Q-tip with my hair piled atop it. ""And you have really great boobs and a total tap-that-ass kind of ass. I'd totally do you.""  
  
  I continued to ignore her as a dull ache started behind my eyes. I so needed to slow down on the coffee, but it was so damn good.  
  
  ""Do you even like boys, Ivy? You know, I swing both ways. I'm more than willing to help a girl out.""  
  
  I rolled my eyes then immediately winced. Lowering the iced coffee, I pressed my palm to my forehead. ""Ow.""  
  
  Val snorted.  
  
  ""I like boys,"" I grumbled as the icepick sensation faded. ""And can we not talk about boys or swinging both ways or helping me out? Because this conversation is going to lead to the lack of orgasms in my life and how I need to get naked with some random dude, and I'm not really in the mood to talk about that.""  
  
  ""What do you want to talk about then?""  
  
  Taking a slower sip of the coffee, I eyed her. ""How come you're not sweating?""  
  
  Val tipped her chin back and laughed so loudly an older couple strolling by with matching fanny packs stared at her. ""Babe, I'm born and raised in Louisiana. My family can be traced back to the original French settlers—""  
  
  ""Blah, blah. Does that somehow mean you have some kind of magical ability that makes you absolutely resistant to the heat while I'm drowning in my own funk?""  
  
  ""Can take the girl out of the north but can't take the north out of the girl.""  
  
  I snorted at that. It was true. Having moved to New Orleans only three years ago from northern Virginia, I still hadn't adapted to the weather. ""Do you know what I'd do for a polar vortex right about now?""  
  
  ""Not have sex, that's for sure.""  
  
  I flipped her off. Truthfully, I didn't even know why I didn't miss a single day when it came to taking my birth control pills. I guessed it was habit from when it actually mattered.  
  
  She giggled as she leaned against the table, her dark brown eyes surveying my philosophy book. ""I just do not get why you're going to college.""  
  
  ""Why not?""  
  
  The look on her face suggested the heat had fried a few of my brain cells. ""You already have a job—a job that pays extraordinarily well, and you don't really need to get another one like some of the others do. We don't have a lot of bennies, and we have probably the shortest lifespan of any job out there that doesn't involve sky diving without a parachute, but that's another reason to not waste your time on that crap.""  
  
  My shrug was my response. To be honest, I wasn't sure why I started going to Loyola a year ago. Maybe it was boredom. Maybe it was the weird need to do something most twenty-one-year-olds were doing. Or  
maybe it ran deeper than that, and whatever that was, was the reason behind taking sociology with a psychology minor. I toyed with the idea of being a social worker, because I knew I could do both things if I wanted to. Maybe it had to do with what happened to—  
  
  I cut those thoughts off. No reason to go there today, or any day. The past was in the past, dead and buried with the entirety of my family.  
  
  Despite the sweltering heat, I shivered. Val was right though. Our lifespan could be brutally short. Since May, we'd lost three Order members—Cora Howard, aged twenty-six. She was killed on Royal, neck snapped. Vincent Carmack, aged twenty-nine. He met the end on Bourbon, his neck torn open. And Shari Jordan, thirty-five, was killed just three weeks ago, her neck also snapped. She'd been found in the warehouse district. Deaths were common, but three in the last five months had all of us uneasy.  
  
  ""You okay?"" Val asked, head tilted to the side.  
  
  ""Yeah."" My gaze tracked the trolley as it rolled past. ""You're working tonight, right?""  
  
  ""Yeppers peppers pots."" Shifting back from the table, she clapped her hands and rubbed them together. ""Want a friendly wager?""  
  
  ""On?""  
  
  Her smile turned downright evil. ""Most kills by one in the morning.""  
  
  An elderly man shuffling past our table sent Val a strange look and then picked up his pace, but the truth was, people heard stranger crap on the streets of New Orleans, especially when you were only a handful of blocks from the French Quarter.  
  
  ""It's a deal."" I finished off the coffee. ""Wait. What do I get when I win?""  
  
  ""If you win,"" she corrected. ""I'll bring you iced coffee for a week. And if I win, you do the . . ."" She trailed off, eyes squinting. ""Lookie. Lookie, artichokie."" She lifted her chin.  
  
  Frowning, I twisted around and immediately saw what Val was talking about. I sucked in a shallow breath as I bent my right leg so my boot was closer to my hand. There was no missing the chick.  
  
  To most humans, like ninety-nine percent of them, the woman in the flowing maxi dress walking down Canal Street looked like the average person. Maybe a tourist. Or possibly a local out shopping on a Wednesday afternoon. But Val and I weren't like most humans. At birth, a lot of mumbo jumbo was said, warding us against glamour. We saw what most did not.  
  
  Which was the monster behind the normal façade.  
  
  This creature was one of the most deadly things known to man and had been since the beginning of time.  
  
  Sunglasses shielded her eyes. For some reason, her race was sensitive to the sunlight. Their true eye color was the palest of blue, a shade leached of all color. But using glamour, a dark magic, their kind could choose what humans saw, so they came with a variety of physical traits, shapes, and sizes. This one was blonde, tall and willowy, almost frail looking, but her appearance was extremely deceptive.  
  
  Not a single human or animal in this world was stronger or faster, and their talents ran the gambit, anywhere from telekinesis to igniting the most violent of fires with a brush of their fingertips. But the most dangerous weapon was their ability to bend mortals to their will, enslaving them. Fae needed humans. Feeding off mortals was the only way the fae slowed their aging process down to a lifespan that rivaled immortality.  
  
  Without humans, they'd age and die just like us.  
  
  Sometimes they played around with their victims, feeding off them for months, if not years, until nothing was left but a dry husk of what used to be. When they did that, they poisoned the human's body and mind, turning them into something just as dangerous and unpredictable as the fae. But sometimes they just outright slaughtered their victims. People like Val and I couldn't be warded against the feeding and the effects at birth, but centuries ago, the simplest and smallest thing had been discovered to null their abilities to manipulate us.  
  
  Nothing was more unexpectedly badass like a four-leaf clover.  
  
  Each member of the Order wore one. Val had a clover encased in her bracelet. I wore mine inside my gemstone tiger-eye necklace. I even wore it at home when I showered and slept, having learned the hard way that no place was truly one hundred percent safe without one.  
  
  Seeing through the glamour that enabled them to blend in was how we were able to spot and hunt them. Their true forms were equally beautiful . . . and disturbing. Skin a silvery color, kind of like liquid nitrogen, and incredibly smooth. Their beauty was eerily flawless, with high angular cheekbones, full lips, and eyes that tilted up at the outer corners. Everything about their true form was creepily alluring, in a way that made it hard to look away. The only thing the fairytales and myths got correct was the slightly pointed ears.  
  
  ""Fucking fae,"" muttered Val.  
  
  My sentiments exactly since they had taken everything from me. Not once, but twice, and I hated them with the passion of ten thousand blazing suns.  
  
  Other than the ears, the fae were nothing like Disney painted them, or the ones Shakespeare had spun tales about, and they, like all their distant relatives, did not belong in this realm. Long, long ago, the fae had discovered a way to breach the divide between the mortal realm and theirs, what was known as the Otherworld. The summer and winter courts, if they'd ever existed, had been dissolved, and there was just one ginormous group with one really scary, totally typical goal.  
  
  They wanted to take over the mortal realm.  
  
  And it was our job to send them back to the Otherworld. Or kill them. Whatever worked the quickest.  
  
  Problem with that was the fact they weren't easy to do either of those things to, and they'd woven themselves into every facet of the mortal world.  
  
  As the fae passed our table, Val smiled up at her, all friendly innocence, and the fae returned a tight smile, having no idea we saw right through it all.  
  
  Val looked at me and winked. ""That one is mine.""  
  
  I flipped my textbook shut. ""No fair.""  
  
  ""Saw her first."" She stood, smoothing her hand along the wide leather belt she wore over the waist of her skirt. ""See you later."" She started to turn. ""Oh, and seriously, thank you for Saturday night. I'll get laid and you'll be able to live vicariously through me.""  
  
  I laughed as I shoved my book into my bag. ""Thanks.""  
  
  ""Always thinking of others. Peace out."" Spinning around, she easily sidestepped another table and disappeared into the throng of people crowding the sidewalk.  
  
  Val would catch up to the fae and lure it to a place where she could quickly dispose of it without the general populace witnessing what would probably look like cold-blooded murder.  
  
  Things got really awkward really fast when an unsuspecting human stumbled upon that mess.  
  
  Other than the mortals that fae kept around for a multitude of nefarious reasons, most of mankind had no idea that the fae were very real even though they were everywhere. And in cities like New Orleans where a whole crap ton of weird could go down without anyone batting an eyelash, they were a plague upon the city.  
  
  As I lifted my gaze and stared out at the swaying palms, I wondered how it was to be like everyone walking up and down the street. To, well, live in blissful ignorance. If I'd been born into any other family than the one I was, so many things would be different.  
  
  I'd probably be graduating from college in the spring. I'd have a large group of friends where memories instead of secrets linked us together. I might even have a—gasp—boyfriend.  
  
  Boyfriend.  
  
  Immediately, the busy street I sat on faded away. It was just me and . . . God, three years later and it still cut deep to even think of Shaun, and it took no effort to picture those soulful brown eyes. Some of the detail was beginning to fade—the image of his face had begun to blur, but the pain had not lessened.  
  
  A seed of sadness rooted deep in my stomach, and I desperately ignored it. Because what did my mother used to say? Not my real mom. I had been too young when she was killed to remember anything about her. My foster mother—Holly—used to say if wishes were fishes, we'd all cast nets. It was a quote she picked up from some book, loosely translated into there was no point in spending time on wishes.  
  
  At leas  
t that's how I took it.  
  
  It wasn't as if I didn't know how important my job—my duty—was. Belonging to the Order, a widespread organization full of knowledge that had been handed down through families, generation after generation, meant my life had more meaning than most.  
  
  Or so they said.  
  
  Each of us was marked with a symbol signifying that we belonged to the Order, and the tattoo, which were three interlocking spirals reminiscent of a Pre-Celtic design. Ours had three straight lines underneath it, though. It had been adopted as the Order's symbol of freedom.  
  
  Freedom to live without fear. Freedom to make our own choices. Freedom to thrive. Mine was next to my hipbone. None of us wore it an area visible to mortals or fae.  
  
  So what I did with my life was important. I got that. The Order was my family. And I didn't regret any of what I had to do or what I'd given up. Even if the vast majority of people had no clue what the Order and I were doing, I was still making a difference with my life. I was saving lives.  
  
  And I was one badass ninja when I wanted to be.  
  
  That brought a grin to my lips.  
  
  Slinging my bag over my shoulder, I grabbed my empty iced coffee and hopped to my feet. It was time to work.  
  
  \~  
  
  The fae I spotted outside of a bar on Bourbon Street reminded me of Daryl Dixon from The Walking Dead. Which was made of suck since I was going to have to kill him.  
  
  He was wearing a tan button-up shirt with the sleeves cut off at the shoulders, the edges frayed and worn, and jeans almost faded out completely at the knees. He had that weirdly hot redneck vibe about him, especially with the shaggy haircut.  
  
  The whole silvery skin tone and pointy ears really ruined the redneck ambiance though.  
  
  In and out of the bars on Bourbon Street, the fae reminded me of a tourist, because each time he walked out, he had a new container in his hand. Rumor had it that human alcohol didn't affect the fae, but nightshade, a plant toxic to humans, worked just like liquor did.  
  
  After seeing him with so many different containers and watching him for the past hour, I began to suspect that each of those bars might have a fae in them, because he was walking like he was three sheets to the wind by the time he wandered off Bourbon and passed the Gumbo Shop.  
  
  I made a mental note to call David Faustin, the head of the New Orleans branch of the Order, to see if he'd heard anything from the other members about nightshade being served at the human bars. But first I needed to take care of the Daryl Dixon reject.  
  
  I couldn't just walk up to the fae and get all stabby with him in front of people. I didn't want to spend a night in jail. Again. The last time someone saw me take out a fae, the police were called, and even though there was no body, I was loaded up with weapons, and that was kind of hard to explain.  
  
  And I really didn't want to listen to David bitch about all the strings he had to pull and blah, blah.  
  
  I'd probably sweated a pound off my boobs by the time the fae stumbled down an alley. Halle-freakin'-lujah. I was starving, there were beignets with my name written all over them, and since it was Wednesday night, there weren't a lot of fae roaming around, so I was totally going to lose my bet with Val.  
  
  The weekend would be a totally different story. When there were more mortals to mess with and it was easier for them to do what they wanted and get away, they came out in droves.  
  
  Kind of like cockroaches scurrying around at night.  
  
  The fae blended in with the thick shadows of the narrow alley, and I was quiet as I followed him, keeping close to the damp brick walls. Sliding my hands off the straps of my backpack, I groaned when the fae stopped halfway down the alley and faced the building.  
  
  His hands dropped to his zipper.  
  
  Was he seriously going to pee? Really? Ugh, that was so not on my list of things I wanted to hear or see tonight. And could I really kill something while it was peeing? Seemed kind of unsportsmanlike to kick a dude with his pants down.  
  
  I was so not going to wait for him to do his business. At the rate in which he was moving, I'd be here for about ten minutes before he got his zipper down.  
  
  Keeping my gaze trained on the fae, I reached down and slipped my hand around the non-business side of the iron stake secured inside my boot. Iron had always been epically destructive to the fae. They didn't go anywhere near it. Just the touch of it singed them, and if you stabbed one in the center of the chest, it didn't kill them but sent them right back to their world.  
  
  However, separating their heads from their bodies ended them. For realsies.  
  
  But sending them to the Otherworld was enough, thank God, because obviously chopping heads off was messy and gross. Gates, hidden all over, were the doorways between our worlds. They'd been closed for centuries, but were still well guarded. Sending them back was a one-way ticket.  
  
  I stepped away from the building, stake in hand as I moved swiftly down the alley. At my back was the hum of the busy street, muted conversations, and the distant drone of laughter.  
  
  My fingers tightened on the stake as the fae shifted his legs, spreading his thighs. I didn't make a sound as I walked right up to him, but some kind of inherent instinct alerted him to my presence. Fae couldn't sense us, but they knew the Order were around.  
  
  The fae twisted at the waist; his milky blue eyes met mine but were unfocused. Confusion splashed across his striking features.  
  
  ""Hi!"" I chirped, cocking my arm back.  
  
  His gaze flickered to my hand and he sighed. ""Fuck.""  
  
  Even intoxicated and about to pee, the fae was freaking fast. Whirling around, he deflected my blow with one arm and lifted his knee. Spinning to the side, I narrowly avoided a kick to the stomach.  
  
  I didn't glance down to see just how far he got with the zipper as I sprung forward and dipped under the arm he swung at me. Popping up behind him, I planted my foot in the center of his back.  
  
  The fae grunted as he staggered a step then turned to me as I rushed forward, ready for this to be over. Swinging my hand with the stake, the sharpened edge wasn't even an inch from his chest when he spat, ""Your whole world is about to end. He's—""  
  
  I shoved the iron stake into his chest, cutting off his words. The stake cut through his skin like he was made of the cheapest tissue. For a second, he stayed completely intact, and he opened his mouth, letting out a high-pitched howl that sounded like a coyote getting run over by a Mack truck.

Holy shark teeth!  
  
  Four incisors were razor sharp and elongated. They reached his lower lip and reminded me of a mutant saber-toothed tiger. Fae could bite. It wasn't pretty. Actually, all creatures from the Otherworld had a tendency to get nippy.  
  
  Snapping back, I lowered the stake as the fae was sort of sucked into itself. From the top of his shaggy head to his sneakers, he folded like a ball of paper being crumpled, going from over six feet to the size of my hand before there was a crack of sound, like one of those bang snap fireworks, and a flash of intense light.  
  
  Then there was nothing.  
  
  ""As last words go, that was kind of cliché and lame,"" I said to the spot where the fae had stood. ""I've heard better.""  
  
  ""I'm sure you have.""  
  
  Heart slamming against my chest, I whirled around. Visions of spending the night in the city jail danced in my head. Despite the fact that I'd probably already been caught red-handed, I shoved the stake behind my back.  
  
  Thankfully, it wasn't one of the city's finest standing at the mouth of the alley, but a man wearing black pants and a white shirt. As he lazily walked forward like he was out for a midnight stroll, I felt no measure of relief.  
  
  The dude obviously saw me stab the fae. This could only mean one of two things. The man belonged to the Order, but wasn't a part of the New Orleans branch, because I didn't recognize him. Or he was a servant to the fae, a human entranced to them. They could be just as dangerous.  
  
  And when you stabbed them, they didn't pull the poof, be-gone act. They bled. They died just like everyone else did. Sometimes slowly. The Order didn't have a no-kill human policy because it was a necessary evil at times, but it had to suck something fierce to kill one.  
  
  My fingers spasmed around the stake. Please don't be a servant. Please be some whack job who thinks I'm his redheaded stepchild or something. Please. Please. ""Can I help you?"" I asked, bracing myself.  
  
  The man cocked his head. Oh, I didn't like this. Every muscle in my body tensed. He stood a few feet inside the mouth of the alley, and then I saw it.  
  
  Pale, washed out blue eyes, slanted at the outer corners—fae eyes. But his skin wasn't silvery. It was a rich olive color that stood out against blond hair so pale it was almost white, and that hair was long, like  
Legolas in the Lord of the Rings long.  
  
  Legolas was kind of hot.  
  
  Okay. I so needed to focus because this dude was not right. Every instinct in me fired off warnings. I took a step back as I eyed the newcomer. There was no glamour on this guy, and he didn't carry the typical glazed over look servants favored. He looked human but not, and there was something about him that screamed he wasn't going to get friendly in any way I'd be happy with.  
  
  The man smiled as he lifted his arm. Out of thin air, a gun appeared in his hand. Just like that. Hand empty one second and the next he was holding a gun.  
  
  What in the holy hell? ...............

This book was amazing, released just a few years ago, detailing the origins of pro wrestling in America, as well as a fantastic cover of Jack Curley's promotional career. 

I'm continuing my timeline posts, and while I mostly use Balllyhoo, I also use other books and sourced articles I can find.

[The first post covered the earliest years of wrestling, the pre-prioneer days of 1864 - 1899.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wreddit/s/V6nrd2JAhS)

[The second post covered the pioneer days of names like Frank Gotch and George Hackenschmidt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wreddit/s/jR1hidtxgu)

This post will cover the convoluted lineage of the original world heavyweight championship, the rise of several key figures like Billy Sandow and ""Strangler"" Lewis, as well as a very influential tournament held in New York.

**Main Characters**

Joe Stecher - a tough as nails standout amateur wrestler looking to turn pro.

Frank Gotch - the biggest name in pro wrestling.

Samuel Rachmann - a theater promoter who would take a turn in pro wrestling.

Jack Curley - a Chicago based promoter with bigger aspirations.

Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis - a young wrestler looking to make a name for himself.

Masked Marvel - am unkown wrestler named Mort Henderson,  who is offered a once in a lifetime opportunity.

As always, it's in chronological order, this one will kick off following Frank Gotch's voctory over George Hackenschmidt in 1911.

**1912 - 1913** 

Following Frank Gotch's second victory over George Hackenschmidt, Gotch continued to tour and defend his world title all over America throughout 1912, defeating names like Martin Plestina and ""Americus"" Gus Schoenlein.

Frank Gotch would officially retire, in what seems to be most reported as April of 1913, for seemingly the half dozenth time in the past five years. He would issue a statement, saying, ""Please announce positively that I am through with wrestling forever. My wife and myself have gone over the matter thoroughly and nothing will induce me to change my mind. The call of the foreigners and the offer of the big New York purses...$25,000 for three bouts...will never make me leave the farm again. I would suggest that Beell and Americus get together and then let the winner of this match defend the title. I will willingly waive my rights to the title in favor of the winner of the Beell-Americus match""

Professional boxing gained legitimate legal status in New York a few years prior, under 1911 Frawley Law, which allowed for fights up to ten rounds in clubs that posted $10,000 bonds with the state to guarantee honest fights. This saw boxing popularity take off and usurp pro wrestlings place in New York.

With Frank Gotch formally retired, the pro wrestling scene took a significant hit in popularity, with the biggest name worth mentioning in those years, being Joe Stetcher, who made his professional debut at nineteen years old, a year prior, in 1912. 

**The Next Generation**

Joe Stecher was a simple Midwesterner with a no-nonsense approach and a body said to have been made strong by his farm work. Stecher won his matches quickly and consistently, and was dubbed, ""The Scissors King"" in homage to his most popular hold, in which Stecher would trap his opponents chest between his legs and squeeze them to defeat. Jack Curley would be quoted on Joe, saying, ""Don't make any mistake on this fellow. I've been in the wrestling game many a year, and he's the greatest I ever saw-bar none.""

**1914**

Frank Gotch's recommended match of Gus ""Americus"" Schoenlein and Fred Beell for the vacant title would become official, and it would see ""Americus"" win the world title on March 13th, 1914, which he would hold for a few months before dropping it to Stanislaus Zbyszko on May 7th. Stanislaus Zbyszko made a name for himself in Europe the previous few years, as mentioned in my [post on Jack Curley.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wreddit/s/XEysiprVyc)

Stanislaus Zbyszko would hold the championship for a few months as well, before vacating the title to enlist in the Austro-Hungarian Army in October 1914, following the beginning of the first World War. Horrifyingly enough, Zbyszko would be captured in Russia during the first World War and spend six years incarcerated as a prisoner of war.

Back to the less bleak tale of pro wrestling though, Charlie Cutler would win the vacated championship ship on January 8th, 1915, after defeating Dr. Ben Roller for the prize. Cutler's reign wouldn't last long either though, eventually dropping it to that kid from Nebraska, Joe Stecher on July 5th, 1915, in front of a sold-out crowd at Rourke Park in downtown Omaha. On his loss, Cutler would be quoted saying, ""When he gets a body scissors on an opponent-good night-its like a giant boa constrictor. Frank Gotch cannot now, nor never could throw him.""

**Strangler**

Worth noting, while looking at the history of pro wrestling, would be Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis, from Wisconsin. While he was once quoted saying that he choose ""Strangler"" as an homage to the original ""Strangler"" Evan Lewis, Ed also said that he just liked the name. Whatever the case, Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis was fast becoming a popular young wrestler, having quit twelve hours per day job in 1909, to begin his career in pro wrestling.

He was still struggling to grow his name value when in 1914, he met an ambitious young manager named Billy Sandow. Sandow would share many qualities with William Brady, the one time wrestling manager behind Yusuf Ismal twenty five years prior. In fact, Billy Sandow actually met William Brady when Sandow was only twelve years old, and was so taken by Brady's flashy presence, that Sandow turned his own attention towards preforming and managing athletes. 

Billy Sandow saw big value in Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis if marketed correctly, and got to work immediately. Sandow had connections with local journalists around Chicago and made sure newspapers and reporters presented Lewis as a human rip saw, and marketed him as a violent and dangerous competitor. Having seen how Joe Stecher was getting the body scissors over as a signature move known to end matches, Sandow got to work putting over a signature headlock for Lewis where he would squeeze the air out of his opponents.

**1915**

With his popularity growing to massive heights, it only seemed fitting for Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis to challenge Joe Stecher for the world title, and that bout took place in October of 1915, in Evansville, Indiana. The bout lasted over two hours and was so slow paced that it drew boo's from the crowd. Eventually a frustrated Stecher charged Lewis, sending him crashing to the ringside area and onto a chair. Despite the doctor on-hand declaring Lewis as fine and ""fit to continue,"" Lewis would forfeit anyways and later claim to have sustained a groin injury from the fall. 

The mayor of Evansville would declare the match a ""fake"" and seized the gate receipts. Though the bout was declared a dud, it didn't change public perception much as there were immediate calls for a re-match. Though that would have to wait until the following year.

Stecher was the first world champion to be widely recognized as a genuine world champion across all of America, since Frank Gotch. Stecher didn't have the same name value as Gotch, though considering pro wrestling popularity was usurped by pro boxing over the previous three years.

Boxing exploded in popularity, with the implementation of the Frawley Law and the undefeated championship reign of Jack Johnson, which lasted over two thousand days, leaving pro wrestling with very little popularity or growth. It wasn't until the first World War started that things would change for the pro wrestling scene. By late 1915, a score of top-flight foreign wrestlers who had fled to America during the early days of the War, were ready to make a splash in the American market. They just needed a promoter who could see the potential. 

**Rachmann's Tournament**

That promoter, would be former actor, turned theatre promoter, Samuel Rachmann. Samuel Rachmann is a name most wrestling fans will have never heard of, but almost every wrestling fan has felt the influence he left on the business. Rachmann would host a wrestling tournament in New York, featuring an all-star cast of world wide talent, and he planned for it to be grander and more ambitious than any tournament the city had ever seen before.

Rachmann, having successfully promoted theatre's and concerts in Europe, wanted to bring that grand flavor to the States for this event, and planned twelve consecutive weeks of nightly wrestling shows at the 3000+ seat theatre, the Manhattan Opera House. Thats right, nightly shows gor twelve straight weeks inside a 3,000 seat venue. 

In early November 1915, Rachmann was quoted in the New York Times, hyping up the event, ""Swedes, Finns, Turks, Greeks, Poles, Huns, Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, French, Germans, Swiss, Danes, English and Americans will compete!"" Rachmann even promised each preformer a weekly salary, something unheard of at the time. Though the starting salary was only $100 per week, with only the top guys earning a percentage of the gate.

I'm assuming some of you may be remembering how Gotch got over as the American hero besting the foreign menace Hackenschmidt, and now wondering why Rachmann would go all in on an international tournament. It's worth considering that between 1900 and 1914, more than thirteen million people arrived to the country, with a large portion finding home in New York, and this influx of people continued for over a decade and only doubled and tripled at the start of the first World War. America, and New York in general, was filled with folks from all over Europe at this point. 

Rachmann seemed poised to win over the theatre going crowd in New York with Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis, who preformed in the tournament, recalling that ""it seemed to be a show conducted by an artist, with artists, for artists."" 

Rachmann seemed to be creating a card that would better resemble something Vince McMahon Jr would later be known for. Rachmann judged his performers based on their ability to excite a crowd and arranged each evenings card in a way that gave it variety, mixing the more serious matches on the same show that also featured matches designed 100% around comedy. Some wrestlers would chase each other around the ring and fight into the wings of the opera house, others would stamp their feet out of frustration when they lost a bout, and it seemed like more so than what came before, this show resembled what we see today. The goal of each wrestler in the tournament seemed to be sports entertainment-infused. Here are several examples of wrestlers in the tournament.

You had one wrestler named Sulo Hevonpaa, who would drape his elegant robe over a chair at ringside, before his opponents would wipe their boots off on it. 

The near-four hundred pound French wrestler, La Colosse made broad pleas to the referee in his over exaggerated accent, as the audience laughed at his inability to communicate. 

""Farmer"" George Bailey had a gimmick that would make Jim Cornette's head explode. Bailey claimed he could hypnotize his opponents and did just that on one match, convincing his opponet to run around the stage like a maniac. 

Greek wrestler Dimitrios Tofalos, was a former Olympic weightlifter, who would come to the ring dressed in a tuxedo, where he would sing opera before changing into his wrestling gear.

One show ended when the curtains above the ring fell mid-match and onto two wrestlers who refused to break their holds. As the theatre staff extinguished the lights and the patrons filed out of the building, they could still hear the two wrestlers groaning in the dark, seemingly still holding onto one another. The Brooklyn Times Union's John Fleeson would wrote about these shows, saying ""It would be impossible to describe what occurs every night. Still, I can say, without fear of contradiction, that there is more genuine comedy and laughter in this tournament than in many play now running.""

Personal note: I've never been a big fan of comedy in wrestling and usually hate it to be honest, but I didn't realize silly shit like this was happening as far back as 1915. Next time I argue against the use of comedy (for my mind isn't changed) I will at least not cite old school wrestling as being above this horseshit. 

Unfortunately though, and has been my argument against comedy in wrestling, Rachmann's tournament struggled to fill seats as the weeks went on. Because comedy isnt sustainable as a long-term solution for filling seats, by the second month, Rachman was reportedly facing thousands of dollars of debt. Ever the showman, Rachmann would gamble even further before admitting defeat, by getting serious.

**The Masked Marvel**

Rachmann kept the tournament going and debuted a new name, and unknown man wearing a black hood with holes cut out for his eyes. This new masked man, was called the Masked Marvel by reporters and became an immediate hit as an unbeatable force in the tournament. The Masked Marvel would make short work of the four hundred pound La Colosse, the the roar of the crowd, and another time when his opponent tried to flee the venue, the Masked Marvl dragged him back to the ring so he could pin him.

The Masked Marvel never stayed long after his win, always quickly heading to the back, which only added to his mystique and aura. The boys in the back didn't even know who he was, as the Masked Marvel would always leave immediately after his matches. When the Marvel did mingle with the crowd, he was a pro who always knew what to say and put himself over. One time when asked what his name was, he told the fans, ""Call me Desdichado,"" referencing the legend of Ivanhoe. He would assure the fans that he has a very good reason for concealing his identity and promised it would all be revealed eventually, though that was all a bluff.

The Masked Marvel's popularity and impact on the tournament cannot be understated, as seats filled up significantly on nights he wrestled, with Rachmann noticing that on the nights Marvel competed, nearly half the seats would be filled with women. Seeing that many women in the stands was unheard for pro wrestling so of course Rachmann started to capitalize on the new found interest. Rachmann adopted a new slogan for the tournament: ""Dont cheat your wife, bring her along!""

Zoe Beckley was a writer for the Washington Post when she was assigned the task of coving the tournament, with her writing ""Every third person in the audience was a woman. I went to stay five minutes and remained there for three hours and a quarter, being then pried, reluctantly, from my seat. Don't ask me what it was all about. The funny part is that you don't have to understand it to enjoy it."" I absolutely love this quote, as it sums up how a non-fan can become immediately indoctrinated by the spectical of pro wrestling.

Worth noting is that The Masked Marvel was not the first masked wrestler in recorded pro wrestling history. The first one was actually all the way back in 1867, in Paris, France, where he got over for a short period besting many of the most well known wrestlers at the time. Many assume that Rachmann must have gotten the idea for the Masked Marvel from that first masked star, nearly fifty years prior. In fact, in the contract Marvel signed for the tournament, it gave Rachmann sole credit for the idea of the Masked Marvel.

Also worth noting in the same vein, would be Ben Atwood, who newspapers claim was the original visionary behind the Masked Marvel. Though Ben would later clarify and say the idea was given to him by Mark Leuscher. Leuscher was a theatre producer who had a hit of his own, years prior with a masked dancer in the Zeigfield Follies, whom he called ""La Domino Rouge."" Credit for choosing thebwrestler to be under the mask, apparently goes to Jack Curley, who had a relationship with Rachmann that was ""vague at best"" with Curley supposedly helping fund some of the tournament.

The man under the mask was Mort Henserson, a no-name wrestler from Altoona, Pennsylvania, who despite being pegged for such a significant role, was still being paid the bare minimum $100 per week. 

**1916**

In January, Henderson abruptly quit the tournament and informed Rachmann that Jack Curley had offered him more than ten times his weekly salary for one big match at Madison Square Garden at the end of the month. While Curley had lreviously set up shop in Chicago, he now found great interest on claiming a foothold in New York. His spot in Chicago would be snatched up by the aforementioned Billy Sandow.

Deapite being under contract, Henderson stopped showing up for his tournament matches and eventually Rachmann hit Henderson with an injunction, just two days before he was scheduled to main event Curley's Garden show.

Just like Jack Curley and Ole Marsh exposed the business in Seattle, five years prior, the resulting suit, which was reported on by all major New York papers, also exposed the business. The suit named Henderson as the Marvel and revealed that his contract with Rachmann called for Henderson to win and lose matches as directed. Luckily for Curley, who faced the prospect of replacing his main attraction on two days notice, both he and Rachmann were able to come to terms and the injunction was dropped. No details are given beyond the fact that Curley and Rachmann spent hours deliberating with their lawyers until some agreement was made between the two promoters.

On January 27th, 1916, Curley's Madison Square Garden show went as planned, with thousands in attendance for the main event that pitted the Masked Marvel Mort Henderson against the current world champion from Nebraska, Joe Stecher. Stetcher would dominate the best two of three falls contest, pinning Henderson in back-to-back falls in less than fifteen minutes. With this show a success, Curley had firmly established his own foothold in Manhattan, making the city his new base of operations going forward.

Rachmann finished his tournament, but without his star attraction, attendance bottomed out completely by the final show. Rachmann, seemingly having enough of pro wrestling, never attempted to get back into the wrestling business. Though he only spent long enough in the buisness to have a cup of coffee, his influence on the product going forward cannot be overstated. Judging by what we just read, Rachmann would have fit right in with a lot modern performers.

**The Dream Match**

Even though he had been retired for several years by 1916, the pro wrestling world wouldn't stop buzzing over the prospect of Frank Gotch challenging Joe Stecher for the world title that Gotch never lost. And just like Gotch-Hackenschmidt from years prior, there was a bidding war of sorts to be the one to land and stage the potential Gotch-Stecher bout. 

An unnamed Chicago promoter reportedly offered Gotch $25,000 for the fight, but Gotch refused unless he was paid at least $35,000. Jack Curley, having set up a home-base in New York, attempted to bring Gotch and Stecher to Manhattan, but Gotch refused, on the grounds that it would draw better if it's done somewhere in the Midwest. The winning bid, came from Gene Melady, a prominent promoter in Nebraska, who made a deal with Curley, thst would see both men hold the match in Omaha.

Gene Melady was a former amateur boxer and college football standout as part of Notre Dame's first football squad, after which he made a fortune dealing in livestock. Melady was able to entice both Gotch and Stecher into the offer, by promising to build a stadium in time to host the event on Labor Day. Another Labor Day payday for Gotch it would seem. Melady on the other hand, was hoping to make history with a $150,000 gate, which would be the biggest pro wrestling had ever seen up to that point. 

While Frank Gotch agreed to a seven month long tour to build interested in the bout, and get him back in ring shape, Joe Stecher was looking to bide his own time with a rematch the fans were clamoring for.

**Stecher vs Lewis II**

On July 4th, 1916, in Omaha, Nebraska, Joe Stecher once again got into the ring with ""Strangler"" Ed Lewis, in a match that is best remembered for miserable weather and miserable contest. It was an outdoor event, with a tarp to block the sun for the wrestlers, but the fans were stuck in the sweltering heat for a rematch that was over two hours long. 

Just like their previous encounter, this was a dull affair with Ed mostly looking to avoid all of Joe's attempts to lock up. Several locals had bet large sums of money that Joe would beat Lewis in under an hour, with some even betting that Joe would win two straight falls. Lewis's manager, Billy Sandow remembers this, later recalling how ""Those Nebraska chaps, loaded with Eastern money they had won previously on Stecher against some of the best in the country, had bet wildly."" When that first hour passed, and those bets turned into losses, many in the crowd turned hostile towards both competitors and started heckling and jeering the contest.

Gene Melady had set this bout up too, and despite the contest starting at 4pm, he didn't plan for it to go past sun down. So as the slow plodding match entered its third hour, and they began to lose daylight, Gene realized that they had no way to view the action. Gene actually got up and suggested they pause the match and resume it in the morning, but the crowd responded so negatively to the suggestion, that Gene immediately got crew to stand on ladders and hold lanterns.

The match was so boring, that the only moment of action happened when some kids lit off fireworks in the middle of the grandstand. Finally, after 9pm, referee Ed Smith shut the match down. Ed was quoted as hilariously saying ""In the name of humanity, the match is over."" Fans would later claim that there was maybe thirty seconds of actual wrestling during the five hour contest where Stecher and Lewis stayed locked up and slowly moved around the ring for hours. Brutal. The fans in attendance apparently threw garbage and bottles at the wrestlers following the end of the match.

**Gotch's End**

Just two weeks later, on July 18th, Frank Gotch arrived in Kenosha, Wisconsin for a public training match with Bob Managoff. Unfortunately, during their friendly skirmish, Gotch's foot became tangled between the two ring mats during a scuffle, and the speed of Gotch's movement snapped his left fibia. Gotch fell to the mat in legitimate shock and had to be carried out of the ring and into a waiting car. Bob Managoff would later recount this day, remembering how ""the people booed. They thought Frank was faking."" Reminds me of Bret Hart breaking his sternum, being unable to stand, but could hear several people in the front row calling him a fake.

Gotch headed back home to recover, and unfortunately his weight would drastically drop, eliminating any chance for the potential Gotch-Stecher bout. Frank Gotch's wrestling career, was effectively over.

Without a blockbuster bout, world champion Joe Stecher found himself in a rare moment of solace and peace. He was only twenty three years old, but he had been going hard in the pro wrestling game for the past four years. Stecher was able to get married and enjoy his honeymoon before being thrust back into the role of pro wrestlings reigning world champion. 

**Broken Lineage**

Stecher's first match back following his marriage, was on December 11th, 1916, in Springfield, Massachusetts. Stecher was facing a wrestler from Finland, who the locals had taken a shine to. Olin didn't expect to win but was hoping to put on an entertaining crowd for Olin's local fans. Stecher didn't get the memo, unfortunately and walked into this bout looking to fight for his life. 

For all his popularity with fans, Stecher had a reputation with the boys as being uncooperative, and on this night, John Olin and the fans of Springfield saw this first hand. The match was messy, with Stecher looking to quickly dispatch Olin and the challenger instead choosing to fight off literally every single attempt at offence from Stecher. The bout would finally end, several hours later, at past 1am, with Olin and Stecher outside the ring, and trading legit punches in the front row. A frustrated Stecher would just walk off and take a DQ loss.

Following his DQ victory over Stecher the prior year, John Olin started to proclaim himself as the real world champion, and even fashioned together a title he would tour in Canadian territories and defend. While Olin wasn't widely recognized as a world champion, and Stecher still held the physical belt, this is the start of this lineage getting muddled.

**1917**

Sticking with the legitimate world title for now, the reign of Joe Stecher would come to an end a few months later when Stecher returned to Omaha, this time challenged by Earl Caddock in a best two of three falls bout. The first two falls lasted several hours, and they called for a brief break, before the third fall, just after 2am. 

Stecher was said to be slumped, sitting in a chair in the dressing room, looking dazed with tears running down his face. Stecher's brother Tony and his managers Joe Hetmanek were with him and remember how Joe was tearfully telling Tony, ""I won't go back and you can't make me go back and nobody can make me go back."" 

Stecher's manager, Hetmanek, sent word back to the referee that Stecher was forfeiting the match. When the referee announced the result and announced Earl Caddock as the new world champion, the crowd erupted. Hetmanek would tell reporters the next day that ""Joe Stecher was not himself.""  

Stecher would later refute this version of events, instead claiming that he didn't return to the ring because he didn't know the match had resumed. I dont know how many people buy that one, and maybe Stecher himself didn't either, because Stecher took the loss as opportunity to dissapear for the wrestling scene for the next five months. The kid was burnt out, going hard like that for nearly five years must have mentally broke him that night.

Back to John Olin's false ""world"" title claim, Billy Sandow must have seen opportunity and arranged a big match between Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis and John Olin at the Chicago Coliseum on May 2nd, 1917. Sandow even arranged for a more frail looking Frank Gotch to act as special guest referee. Unsurprisingly, Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis would win the false ""world"" title in a best two of three falls contest in under three hours, and infront of 7,000 fans.  

Lewis would briefly drop that ""world"" title to Stanislaus Zbyszko's little brother, Wladek Zbyszko, later that year in June. This was just another short reign though, with Lewis winning the title back less than a month later, and I suspect this had to do with Jack Curley, who had big plans for Wladek. Before returning home at the start of the first World War, Stanislaus brought his younger brother to the States in 1913, and Jack Curley had plans to make him a star. 

As you can see the world title lineage gets a little messy. We already had John Olin drop a false ""world"" title to Lewis and soon after promoter Jack Curley fashioned himself another ""world"" title for the New York area, and in December of 1917 proclaimed Polish athlete Wladek Zbyszko to be the world heavyweight champion in pro wrestling. 

Worth noting, for his significance alone to the sport, would be the passing of Frank Gotch. Gotch passed away on December 16th, 1917, in his home in Humboldt, with his wife and four-year-old son by his side. He spent the final years of his life battling various health issues that would eventually be diagnosed as uremia, a poisoning of the blood caused by untreated kidney failure. Frank Gotch, was only forty years old.

That's a good place to stop here, considering the passing of Gotch and Curley's move to New York. The next part will show how promoters Curley and Sandow would volley for control of the wrestling world and detail the rise of of Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis into the biggest name in wrestling.

Below, you will find the title history as it's detailed here.

**Championship History 1912 - 1917**

**World Heavyweight Championship**

Frank Gotch, April 3rd, 1908 - April 1st, 1913 (estimated 1824 days as champion)

**John Olin's false ""world"" title claim**

This title lineage began on December 12th, 1916, when John Olin defeated legitimate world champion Joe Stecher by DQ. Stecher never technically dropped the title, but Olin claimed to be a world champion from that point on, with several notable promoters like Billy Sandow willing to work with him.

since I (M27) moved into a new apartment last year, I have very poor sleep. Most of the nights I wake up in the night and can barely fall asleep again. Also I have very vivid dreams and I'm absolutely not recovered in the morning.
Strange thing here is: I have this sleep issue only in my apartment. Sleeping at my parents or girlfriends place I don't have any problems falling asleep. 

So my guess was always some kind of allergy (mold?). Argument for that would be that as soon as I'm laying down, I feel my bronchi getting blocked and it feels like my lung volume shrink immediately. Sometimes my eyes also start tearing and have palpitations when laying down.
And the only thing that improves sleep is Cetirizine. Although I don't have any known allergies..
Often I have a blocked nose in the morning that will be completely gone throughout the day.

My sleep hygiene is already very good:
- darkness
- earplugs
- no coffee & alcohol
- no meals after 8 pm
- same bedtime almost everyday 
- air purifier

But even with all these improvements my sleep is not getting better. I did a polysomnography.. Result is no sleep apnea and Doc doesn't believe in allergy. He doesn't know anybody with allergy symptoms only in the night.

I switched mattresses and blankets, but all that didn't help. After all, I moved out but sleep didn't improve.

Someone out here who has faced similar issues or has any idea/hint for me?

Started a strict carnivore diet in Nov. 2023 right during the holidays (yep that was a struggle lol). Weight was 305 lbs. Immediate results were better sleep, more energy, skin was clearing up, libido was through the roof (thought I had ED for almost two years) and I lost about 30 lbs by March 2024. My then 17 year old son, started living with me and from strict I became more animal based because I introduced him to the lifestyle as he was about 100 lbs overweight. He's now gone off to the military (lost 110 lbs in one year due to being 90% strict carnivore but also, you know, teenage metabolism) and I'm back to being strict carnivore once again.   
  
FF to now, being animal based wasn't helping me as I started becoming inflamed again and always felt bloated so I decided to go back to being strict. I'm one month in and I feel the difference already and I ***believe*** that I'm in ketosis as I no longer suffer from cravings and also don't have keto flu. I drink my homemade LMNT drink every day and drink nothing but water and one lg cup of straight black coffee with a bit of grass-fed butter. My concern is that although I feel great again, I don't see any change in my body. I know that this isn't a weight loss miracle, but based off my first time being on the diet, I lost a nice chunk of weight and body fat. My diet has been consistent with eating chuck roast, an occasional ribeye, 80/20 ground beef, eggs, bacon, butter, cooking with beef tallow and ghee. I don't have cheese that much but if I do, it's raw cheese and it's literally a small piece every 2-3 days so it's not a lot. I do use hot sauce but I made sure the ingredients are only Aged Peppers, Distilled Vinegar, Salt.

My question is, am I doing something wrong? Is my body still trying to adapt to burning fat instead of carbs? I'm going to be honest I'd like to drop down to 250lbs by Jan. 1 because I myself am going back into the military to serve alongside my son so I'm just a little curious about my body now. Any advice is welcomed and thank you in advance. ",1,1749577700.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

She leans over my shoulder and lifts a dusty rag, one of my old cloth diapers, to remove a tape measure hidden underneath. Then she kisses my forehead. “I’ll leave you in ..............","Sir?” she repeats. “How soon do you want it to get there?” I rub two fingers, hard, over my left eyebrow. The throbbing has become intense. “It doesn’t matter,” I say.  The clerk takes the package. The same shoebox that sat on my porch less than twenty-four hours ago; rewrapped in a brown paper bag, sealed with clear packing tape, exactly as I had received it. But now addressed with a new name. The next name on Hannah Baker’s list. “Baker’s dozen,” I mumble. Then I feel disgusted for even noticing it. “Excuse me?” I shake my head. “How much is it?”  
She places the box on a rubber pad, then punches a sequence on her keypad.  I set my cup of gas-station coffee on the counter and glance at the screen. I pull a few bills from my wallet, dig some coins out of my pocket, and place my money on the counter. “I don’t think the coffee’s kicked in yet,” she says. “You’re missing a dollar.” I hand over the extra dollar, then rub the sleep from my eyes. The coffee’s lukewarm when I take a sip, making it harder to gulp down. But I need to wake up somehow.  
Or maybe not. Maybe it’s best to get through the day half-asleep. Maybe that’s the only way to get through today.  “It should arrive at this address tomorrow,” she says. “Maybe the day after tomorrow.” Then she drops the box into a cart behind her.  I should have waited till after school. I should have given Jenny one final day of peace.  
  Though she doesn’t deserve it. When she gets home tomorrow, or the next day, she’ll find a package on her doorstep. Or if her mom or dad or someone else gets there first, maybe she’ll find it on her bed. And she’ll be excited. I was excited. A package with no return address? Did they forget, or was it intentional? Maybe from a secret admirer?  “Do you want your receipt?” the clerk asks.  
  I shake my head.  A small printer clicks one out anyway. I watch her tear the slip across the serrated plastic and drop it into a wastebasket.  There’s only one post office in town. I wonder if the same clerk helped the other people on the list, those who got this package before me. Did they keep their receipts as sick souvenirs? Tuck them in their underwear drawers? Pin them up on corkboards?  I almost ask for my receipt back. I almost say, “I’m sorry, can I have it after all?” As a reminder. But if I wanted a reminder, I could’ve made copies of the tapes or saved the map. But I never want to hear those tapes again, though her voice will never leave my head. And the houses, the streets, and the high school will always be there to remind me.  
  
  It’s out of my control now. The package is on its way. I leave the post office without the receipt.  
  
  Deep behind my left eyebrow, my head is still pounding. Every swallow tastes sour, and the closer I get to school, the closer I come to collapsing.  
  
  I want to collapse. I want to fall on the sidewalk right there and drag myself into the ivy. Because just beyond the ivy the sidewalk curves, following the outside of the school parking lot. It cuts through the front lawn and into the main building. It leads through the front doors and turns into a hallway, which meanders between rows of lockers and classrooms on both sides, finally entering the always-open door to first period.  
  
  At the front of the room, facing the students, will be the desk of Mr. Porter. He’ll be the last to receive a package with no return address. And in the middle of the room, one desk to the left, will be the desk of Hannah Baker.  
  
  Empty.  
  
  YESTERDAY  
  
  ONE HOUR AFTER SCHOOL  
  
  A shoebox-sized package is propped against the front door at an angle. Our front door has a tiny slot to shove mail through, but anything thicker than a bar of soap gets left outside. A hurried scribble on the wrapping addresses the package to Clay Jensen, so I pick it up and head inside.  
  
  I take the package into the kitchen and set it on the counter. I slide open the junk drawer and pull out a pair of scissors. Then I run a scissor blade around the package and lift off its top. Inside the shoebox is a rolled-up tube of bubble-wrap. I unroll that and discover seven loose audiotapes.  
  
  Each tape has a dark blue number painted in the upper right-hand corner, possibly with nail polish. Each side has its own number. One and two on the first tape, three and four on the next, five and six, and so on. The last tape has a thirteen on one side, but nothing on the back.  
  
  Who would send me a shoebox full of audiotapes? No one listens to tapes anymore. Do I even have a way to play them?  
  
  The garage! The stereo on the workbench. My dad bought it at a yard sale for almost nothing. It’s old, so he doesn’t care if it gets coated with sawdust or splattered with paint. And best of all, it plays tapes.  
  
  I drag a stool in front of the workbench, drop my backpack to the floor, then sit down. I press Eject on the player. A plastic door eases open and I slide in the first tape.  
  
  CASSETTE 1: SIDE A  
  
  Hello, boys and girls. Hannah Baker here. Live and in stereo.  
  
  I don’t believe it.  
  
  No return engagements. No encore. And this time, absolutely no requests.  
  
  No, I can’t believe it. Hannah Baker killed herself.  
  
  I hope you’re ready, because I’m about to tell you the story of m  
y life. More specifically, why my life ended. And if you’re listening to these tapes, you’re one of the reasons why.  
  
  What? No!  
  
  I’m not saying which tape brings you into the story. But fear not, if you received this lovely little box, your name will pop up…I promise.  
  
  Now, why would a dead girl lie?  
  
  Hey! That sounds like a joke. Why would a dead girl lie? Answer: Because she can’t stand up.  
  
  Is this some kind of twisted suicide note?  
  
  Go ahead. Laugh.  
  
  Oh well. I thought it was funny.  
  
  Before Hannah died, she recorded a bunch of tapes. Why?  
  
  The rules are pretty simple. There are only two. Rule number one: You listen. Number two: You pass it on. Hopefully, neither one will be easy for you.  
  
  “What’s that you’re playing?”  
  
  “Mom!”  
  
  I scramble for the stereo, hitting several buttons all at once.  
  
  “Mom, you scared me,” I say. “It’s nothing. A school project.”  
  
  My go-to answer for anything. Staying out late? School project. Need extra money? School project. And now, the tapes of a girl. A girl who, two weeks ago, swallowed a handful of pills.  
  
  School project.  
  
  “Can I listen?” she asks.  
  
  “It’s not mine,” I say I scrape the toe of my shoe against the concrete floor. “I’m helping a friend. It’s for history. It’s boring.”  
  
  “Well, that’s nice of you,” she says. She leans over my shoulder and lifts a dusty rag, one of my old cloth diapers, to remove a tape measure hidden underneath. Then she kisses my forehead. “I’ll leave you in peace.”  
  
  I wait till the door clicks shut, then I place a finger over the Play button. My fingers, my hands, my arms, my neck, everything feels hollow. Not enough strength to press a single button on a stereo.  
  
  I pick up the cloth diaper and drape it over the shoebox to hide it from my eyes. I wish I’d never seen that box or the seven tapes inside it. Hitting Play that first time was easy. A piece of cake. I had no idea what I was about to hear.  
  
  But this time, it’s one of the most frightening things I’ve ever done.  
  
  I turn the volume down and press Play.  
  
  …one: You listen. Number two: You pass it on. Hopefully, neither one will be easy for you.  
  
  When you’re done listening to all thirteen sides—because there are thirteen sides to every story—rewind the tapes, put them back in the box, and pass them on to whoever follows your little tale. And you, lucky number thirteen, you can take the tapes straight to hell. Depending on your religion, maybe I’ll see you there.  
  
  In case you’re tempted to break the rules, understand that I did make a copy of these tapes. Those copies will be released in a very public manner if this package doesn’t make it through all of you.  
  
  This was not a spur-of-the-moment decision.  
  
  Do not take me for granted…again.  
  
  No. There’s no way she could think that.  
  
  You are being watched.  
  
  My stomach squeezes in on itself, ready to make me throw up if I let it. Nearby, a plastic bucket sits upside-down on a footstool. In two strides, if I need to, I can reach the handle and flip it over.  
  
  I hardly knew Hannah Baker. I mean, I wanted to. I wanted to know her more than I had the chance. Over the summer, we worked together at the movie theater. And not long ago, at a party, we made out. But we never had the chance to get closer. And not once did I take her for granted. Not once.  
  
  These tapes shouldn’t be here. Not with me. It has to be a mistake.  
  
  Or a terrible joke.  
  
  I pull the trash can across the floor. Although I checked it once already, I check the wrapping again. A return address has got to be here somewhere. Maybe I’m just overlooking it.  
  
  Hannah Baker’s suicide tapes are getting passed around. Someone made a copy and sent them to me as a joke. Tomorrow at school, someone will laugh when they see me, or they’ll smirk and look away. And then I’ll know.  
  
  And then? What will I do then?  
  
  I don’t know.  
  
  I almost forgot. If you’re on my list, you should’ve received a map.  
  
  I let the wrapping fall back in the trash.  
  
  I’m on the list.  
  
  A few weeks ago, just days before Hannah took the pills, someone slipped an envelope through the vent of my locker. The outside of the envelope said: SAVE THIS—YOU’LL NEED IT in red felt-tip marker. Inside was a folded up map of the city. About a dozen red stars marked different areas around town.  
  
  In elementary school, we used those same chamber of commerce maps to learn about north, south, east, and west. Tiny blue numbers scattered around the map matched up with business names listed in the margins.  
  
  I kept Hannah’s map in my backpack. I meant to show it around school to see if anyone else got one. To see if anyone knew what it meant. But over time, it slid beneath my textbooks and notebooks and I forgot all about it.  
  
  Till now.  
  
  Throughout the tapes, I’ll be mentioning several spots around our beloved city for you to visit. I can’t force you to go there, but if you’d like a little more insight, just head for the stars. Or, if you’d like, just throw the maps away and I’ll never know.  
  
  As Hannah speaks through the dusty speakers, I feel the weight of my backpack pressing against my leg. Inside, crushed somewhere at the bottom, is her map.  
  
  Or maybe I will. I’m not actually sure how this whole dead thing works. Who knows, maybe I’m standing behind you right now.  
  
  I lean forward, propping my elbows on the workbench. I let my face fall into my hands and I slide my fingers back into unexpectedly damp hair.  
  
  I’m sorry. That wasn’t fair.  
  
  Ready, Mr. Foley?  
  
  Justin Foley. A senior. He was Hannah’s first kiss.  
  
  But why do I know that?  
  
  Justin, honey, you were my very first kiss. My very first hand to hold. But you were nothing more than an average guy. And I don’t say that to be mean—I don’t. There was just something about you that made me need to be your girlfriend. To this day I don’t know exactly what that was. But it was there…and it was amazingly strong.  
  
  You don’t know this, but two years ago when I was a freshman and you were a sophomore, I used to follow you around. For sixth period, I worked in the attendance office, so I knew every one of your classes. I even photocopied your schedule, which I’m sure I still have here somewhere. And when they go through my belongings, they’ll probably toss it away thinking a freshman crush has no relevance. But does it?  
  
  For me, yes, it does. I went back as far as you to find an introduction to my story. And this really is where it begins.  
  
  So where am I on this list, among these stories? Second? Third? Does it get worse as it goes along? She said lucky number thirteen could take the tapes to hell.  
  
  When you reach the end of these tapes, Justin, I hope you’ll understand your role in all of this. Because it may seem like a small role now, but it matters. In the end, everything matters.  
  
  Betrayal. It’s one of the worst feelings.  
  
  I know you didn’t mean to let me down. In fact, most of you listening probably had no idea what you were doing—what you were truly doing.  
  
  What was I doing, Hannah? Because I honestly have no idea. That night, if it’s the night I’m thinking of, was just as strange for me as it was for you. Maybe more so, since I still have no idea what the hell happened.  
  
  Our first red star can be found at C-4. Take your finger over to C and drop it down to 4. That’s right, like Battleship. When you’re done with this tape, you should go there. We only lived in that house a short while, the summer before my freshman year, but it’s where we lived when we first came to town.  
  
  And it’s where I first saw you, Justin. Maybe you’ll remember. You were in love with my friend Kat. School was still two months away, and Kat was the only person I knew because she lived right next door. She told me you were all over her the previous year. Not literally all over her—just staring a  
nd accidentally bumping into her in the halls.  
  
  I mean, those were accidents, right?  
  
  Kat told me that at the end-of-school dance, you finally found the nerve to do more than stare and bump into her. The two of you danced every slow song together. And soon, she told me, she was going to let you kiss her. The very first kiss of her life. What an honor!  
  
  The stories must be bad. Really bad. That’s the only reason the tapes are passing on from one person to the next. Out of fear.  
  
  Why would you want to mail out a bunch of tapes blaming you in a suicide? You wouldn’t. But Hannah wants us, those of us on the list, to hear what she has to say. And we’ll do what she says, passing the tapes on, if only to keep them away from people not on the list.  
  
  “The list.” It sounds like a secret club. An exclusive club.  
  
  And for some reason, I’m in it.  
  
  I wanted to see what you looked like, Justin, so we called you from my house and told you to come over. We called from my house because Kat didn’t want you to know where she lived…well, not yet…even though her house was right next door.  
  
  You were playing ball—I don’t know if it was basketball, baseball, or what—but you couldn’t come over until later. So we waited.  
  
  Basketball. A lot of us played that summer, hoping to make JV as freshmen. Justin, only a sophomore, had a spot waiting for him on varsity. So a lot of us played ball with him in hopes of picking up skills over the summer. And some of us did.

While some of us, unfortunately, did not.  
  
  We sat in my front bay window, talking for hours, when all of a sudden you and one of your friends—hi, Zach!—came walking up the street.  
  
  Zach? Zach Dempsey? The only time I’ve seen Zach with Hannah, even momentarily, was the night I first met her.  
  
  Two streets meet in front of my old house like an upside-down T, so you were walking up the middle of the road toward us.  
  
  Wait. Wait. I need to think.  
  
  I pick at a speck of dry orange paint on the workbench. Why am I listening to this? I mean, why put myself through this? Why not just pop the tape out of the stereo and throw the entire box of them in the trash?  
  
  I swallow hard. Tears sting at the corners of my eyes.  
  
  Because it’s Hannah’s voice. A voice I thought I’d never hear again. I can’t throw that away.  
  
  And because of the rules. I look at the shoebox hidden beneath the cloth diaper. Hannah said she made a copy of each of these tapes. But what if she didn’t? Maybe if the tapes stop, if I don’t pass them on, that’s it. It’s over. Nothing happens.  
  
  But what if there’s something on these tapes that could hurt me? What if it’s not a trick? Then a second set of tapes will be released. That’s what she said. And everyone will hear what’s on them.  
  
  The spot of paint flakes off like a scab.  
  
  Who’s willing to test her bluff?  
  
  You stepped out of the gutter and planted one foot on the lawn. My dad had the sprinklers running all morning so the grass was wet and your foot slid forward, sending you into a split. Zach had been staring at the window, trying to get a better view of Kat’s new friend—yours truly—and he tripped over you, landing beside you on the curb.  
  
  You pushed him off and stood up. Then he stood up, and you both looked at each other, not sure of what to do. And your decision? You ran back down the street while Kat and I laughed like crazy in the window.  
  
  I remember that. Kat thought it was so funny. She told me about it at her going-away party that summer.  
  
  The party where I first saw Hannah Baker.  
  
  God. I thought she was so pretty. And new to this town, that’s what really got me. Around the opposite sex, especially back then, my tongue twisted into knots even a Boy Scout would walk away from. But around her I could be the new and improved Clay Jensen, high school freshman.  
  
  Kat moved away before the start of school, and I fell in love with the boy she left behind. And it wasn’t long until that boy started showing an interest in me. Which might have had something to do with the fact that I seemed to always be around.  
  
  We didn’t share any classes, but our classrooms for periods one, four, and five were at least close to each other. Okay, so period five was a stretch, and sometimes I wouldn’t get there until after you’d left, but periods one and four were at least in the same hall.  
  
  At Kat’s party, everyone hung around the outside patio even though the temperature was freezing. It was probably the coldest night of the year. And I, of course, forgot my jacket at home.  
  
  After a while, I managed to say hello. And a little while later, you managed to say it back. Then, one day, I walked by you without saying a word. I knew you couldn’t handle that, and it led to our very first multiword conversation.  
  
  No, that’s not right. I left my jacket at home because I wanted everyone to see my new shirt.  
  
  What an idiot I was.  
  
  “Hey!” you said. “Aren’t you going to say hello?”  
  
  I smiled, took a breath, then turned around. “Why should I?”  
  
  “Because you always say hello.”  
  
  I asked why you thought you were such an expert on me. I said you probably didn’t know anything about me.  
  
  At Kat’s party, I bent down to tie my shoe during my first conversation with Hannah Baker. And I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t tie my stupid shoelace because my fingers were too numb from the cold.  
  
  To Hannah’s credit, she offered to tie it for me. Of course, I wouldn’t let her. Instead, I waited till Zach inserted himself into our awkward conversation before sneaking inside to thaw my fingers beneath running water.  
  
  So embarrassing.  
  
  Earlier, when I asked my mom how to get a boy’s attention, she said, “Play hard to get.” So that’s what I was doing. And sure enough, it worked. You started hanging around my classes waiting for me.  
  
  It seemed like weeks went by before you finally asked for my number. But I knew you eventually would, so I practiced saying it out loud. Real calm and confident like I didn’t really care. Like I gave it out a hundred times a day.  
  
  Yes, boys at my old school had asked for my number. But here, at my new school, you were the first.  
  
  No. That’s not true. But you were the first to actually get my number.  
  
  It’s not that I didn’t want to give it out before. I was just cautious. New town. New school. And this time, I was going to be in control of how people saw me. After all, how often do we get a second chance?  
  
  Before you, Justin, whenever anyone asked, I’d say all the right numbers up until the very last one. And then I’d get scared and mess up…sort of accidentally on purpose.  
  
  I heave my backpack onto my lap and unzip the largest pocket.  
  
  I was getting way too excited watching you write down my number. Luckily, you were way too nervous to notice. When I finally spat out that last number—the correct number!—I smiled so big.  
  
  Meanwhile, your hand was shaking so badly that I thought you were going to screw it up. And I was not going to let that happen.  
  
  I pull out her map and unfold it on the workbench.  
  
  I pointed at the number you were writing. “That should be a seven,” I said.  
  
  “It is a seven.”  
  
  I use a wooden ruler to smooth out the creases.  
  
  “Oh. Well, as long as you know it’s a seven.”  
  
  “I do,” you said. But you scratched it out anyway and made an even shakier seven.  
  
  I stretched the cuff of my sleeve into my palm and almost reached over to wipe the sweat from your forehead…something my mother would’ve done. But thankfully, I didn’t do that. You never would’ve asked another girl for her number again.  
  
  Through the side garage door, Mom calls my name. I lower the volume, ready to hit Stop if it opens.  
  
  “Yes?”  
  
  By the time I got home, you’d already called. Twice.  
  
  “I want you to keep working,” Mom says, “but I need to know if you’re having dinner with us.”  
  
  My mom asked who you were, and I said we had a class together. You were probably just calling with a homework question. And she said that’s exactly what you had told her.  
  
  I look down at the first red star. C-4. I know where that is. But should I go there?  
  
  I couldn’t believe it. Justin, you lied to my mom.  
  
  So why did that make me so happy?  
  
  “No,” I say. “I’m heading to a friend’s house. For his project.”  
  
  Because our lies matched. It was a sign.  
  
  “That’s fine,” Mom says. “I’ll keep some in the fridge and you can heat it up later.”  
  
  My mom asked what class we had and I said math, which wasn’t a total lie. We both had math. Just not together. And not the same type.  
  
  “Good,” Mom said. “That’s what he told me.”  
  
  I accused her of not trusting her own daughter, grabbed the slip of paper with your number from her hand, and ran upstairs.  
  
  I’ll go there. To the first star. But before that, when this side of the tape is over, I’ll go to Tony’s.  
  
  Tony never upgraded his car stereo so he still plays tapes. That way, he says, he’s in control of the music. If he gives someone a ride and they bring their own music, too bad. “The format’s not compatible,” he tells them.  
  
  When you answered the phone, I said, “Justin? It’s Hannah. My mom said you called with a math problem.”  
  
  Tony drives an old Mustang handed down from his brother, who got it from his dad, who probably got it from his  
dad. At school there are few loves that compare to the one between Tony and his car. More girls have dumped him out of car envy than my lips have even kissed.  
  
  You were confused, but eventually you remembered lying to my mom and, like a good boy, you apologized.  
  
  While Tony doesn’t classify as a close friend, we have worked on a couple of assignments together so I know where he lives. And most important of all, he owns an old Walkman that plays tapes. A yellow one with a skinny plastic headset that I’m sure he’ll let me borrow. I’ll take a few tapes with me and listen to them as I walk through Hannah’s old neighborhood, which is only a block or so from Tony’s.  
  
  “So, Justin, what’s the math problem?” I asked. You weren’t getting off that easy.  
  
  Or maybe I’ll take the tapes somewhere else. Somewhere private. Because I can’t listen here. Not that Mom or Dad will recognize the voice in the speakers, but I need room. Room to breathe.  
  
  And you didn’t miss a beat. You told me Train A was leaving your house at 3:45 PM. Train B was leaving my house ten minutes later.  
  
  You couldn’t see this, Justin, but I actually raised my hand like I was in school rather than sitting on the edge of my bed. “Pick me, Mr. Foley. Pick me,” I said. “I know the answer.”  
  
  When you called my name, “Yes, Miss Baker?” I threw Mom’s hard-to-get rule right out the window. I told you the two trains met at Eisenhower Park at the bottom of the rocket slide.  
  
  What did Hannah see in him? I never got that. Even she admits she was unable to put her finger on it. But for an average-looking guy, so many girls are into Justin.  
  
  Sure, he is kind of tall. And maybe they find him intriguing. He’s always looking out windows, contemplating something.  
  
  A long pause at your end of the line, Justin. And I mean a looooooong pause. “So, when do the trains meet?” you asked.  
  
  “Fifteen minutes,” I said.  
  
  You said fifteen minutes seemed awfully slow for two trains going full speed.  
  
  Whoa. Slow down, Hannah.  
  
  I know what you’re all thinking. Hannah Baker is a slut.  
  
  Oops. Did you catch that? I said, “Hannah Baker is.” Can’t say that anymore.  
  
  She stops talking.  
  
  I drag the stool closer to the workbench. The two spindles in the tape deck, hidden behind a smoky plastic window, pull the tape from one side to the other. A gentle hiss comes through the speaker. A soft static hum.  
  
  What is she thinking? At that moment, are her eyes shut? Is she crying? Is her finger on the Stop button, hoping for the strength to press it? What is she doing? I can’t hear!  
  
  Wrong.  
  
  Her voice is angry. Almost trembling.  
  
  Hannah Baker is not, and never was, a slut. Which begs the question, What have you heard?  
  
  I simply wanted a kiss. I was a freshman girl who had never been kissed. Never. But I liked a boy, he liked me, and I was going to kiss him. That’s the story—the whole story—right there.  
  
  What was the other story? Because I did hear something.  
  
  The few nights leading up to our meeting in the park, I’d had the same dream. Exactly the same. From beginning to end. And for your listening pleasure, here it is.  
  
  But first, a little background.  
  
  My old town had a park similar to Eisenhower Park in one way. They both had that rocket ship. I’m sure it was made by the same company because they looked identical. A red nose points to the sky. Metal bars run from the nose all the way down to green fins holding the ship off the ground. Between the nose and the fins are three platforms, connected by three ladders. On the top level is a steering wheel. On the mid level is a slide that leads down to the playground.  
  
  On many nights leading up to my first day of school here, I’d climb to the top of that rocket and let my head fall back against the steering wheel. The night breeze blowing through the bars calmed me. I’d just close my eyes and think of home.  
  
  I climbed up there once, only once, when I was five. I screamed and cried my head off and would not come down for anything. But Dad was too big to fit through the holes. So he called the fire department, and they sent a female firefighter up to get me. They must’ve had a lot of those rescues because, a few weeks ago, the city announced plans to tear the rocket slide down.  
  
  I think that’s the reason, in my dreams, my first kiss took place at the rocket ship. It reminded me of innocence. And I wanted my first kiss to be just that. Innocent.  
  
  Maybe that’s why she didn’t red-star the park. The rocket might be gone before the tapes make it through the entire list.  
  
  So back to my dreams, which started the day you began waiting outside my classroom door. The day I knew you liked me.  
  
  Hannah took off her shirt and let Justin put his hands up her bra. That’s it. That’s what I heard happened in the park that night.  
  
  But wait. Why would she do that in the middle of a park?  
  
  The dream starts with me at the top of the rocket, holding on to the steering wheel. It’s still a playground rocket, not a real one, but every time I turn the wheel to the left, the trees in the park lift up their roots and sidestep it to the left. When I turn the wheel to the right, they sidestep it to the right.  
  
  Then I hear your voice calling up from the ground. “Hannah! Hannah! Stop playing with the trees and come see me.”  
  
  So I leave the steering wheel and climb through the hole in the top platform. But when I reach the next platform, my feet have grown so huge they won’t fit through the next hole.  
  
  Big feet? Seriously? I’m not into dream analysis, but maybe she was wondering if Justin had a big one.  
  
  I poke my head through the bars and shout, “My feet are too big. Do you still want me to come down?”  
  
  “I love big feet,” you shout back. “Come down the slide and see me. I’ll catch you.”  
  
  So I sit on the slide and push off. But the wind resistance on my feet makes me go so slow. In the time it takes me to reach the bottom of the slide, I’ve noticed that your feet are extremely small. Almost nonexistent.  
  
  I knew it!  
  
  You walk to the end of the slide with your arms out, ready to catch me. And wouldn’t you know it, when I jump off, my huge feet don’t step on your little feet.  
  
  “See? We were made for each other,” you say. Then you lean in to kiss me. Your lips getting closer…and closer…and…I wake up.  
  
  Every night for a week I woke up in the exact same about-to-be-kissed spot. But now, Justin, I would finally be meeting you. At that park. At the bottom of that slide. And damn it, you were going to kiss the hell out of me whether you liked it or not.  
  
  Hannah, if you kissed back then like you kissed at the party, trust me, he liked it.  
  
  I told you to meet me there in fifteen minutes. Of course, I only said that to make sure I got there before you. By the time you walked into the park, I wanted to be inside that rocket and all the way up, just like in my dreams. And that’s how it happened…minus the dancing trees and funky feet.  
  
  From my viewpoint at the top of the rocket, I saw you come in at the far end of the park. You checked your watch every few steps and walked over to the slide, looking all around, but never up.  
  
  So I spun the steering wheel as hard as I could to make it rattle. You took a step back, looked up, and called my name. But don’t worry, even though I wanted to live out my dream, I didn’t expect you to know every single line and tell me to stop playing with the trees and come down.  
  
  “Be right down,” I said.  
  
  But you told me to stop. You’d climb up to where I was.  
  
  So I shouted back, “No! Let me take the slide.”  
  
  Then you repeated those magical, dreamlike words, “I’ll catch you.”  
  
  Definitely beats my first kiss. Seventh grade, Andrea Williams, behind the gym after school. She came over to my table at lunch, whispered the proposition in my ear, and I had a hard-on for the rest of the day.  
  
  When the kiss was over, three strawberry-lip-gloss seconds later, she turned and ran away. I peeked around the gym an  
d watched two of her friends each hand her a five-dollar bill. I couldn’t believe it! My lips were a ten-dollar bet.  
  
  Was that good or bad? Probably bad, I decided.  
  
  But I’ve loved strawberry lip gloss ever since.  
  
  I couldn’t help smiling as I climbed down the top ladder. I sat myself on the slide—my heart racing. This was it. All my friends back home had their first kisses in middle school. Mine was waiting for me at the bottom of a slide, exactly as I wanted it. All I had to do was push off.  
  
  And I did.  
  
  I know it didn’t really happen like this, but when I look back, it all happens in slow motion. The push. The slide. My hair flying behind me. You raising your arms to catch me. Me raising mine so you could.  
  
  So when did you decide to kiss me, Justin? Was it during your walk to the park? Or did it simply happen when I slid into your arms?  
  
  Okay, who out there wants to know my very first thought during my very first kiss? Here it is: Somebody’s been eating chilidogs.  
  
  Nice one, Justin.  
  
  I’m sorry. It wasn’t that bad, but it was the first thing I thought.  
  
  I’ll take strawberry lip gloss any day.  
  
  I was so anxious about what kind of kiss it would be—because my friends back home described so many types—and it turned out to be the beautiful kind. You didn’t shove your tongue down my throat. You didn’t grab my butt. We just held our lips together…and kissed.  
  
  And that’s it.  
  
  Wait. Stop. Don’t rewind. There’s no need to go back because you didn’t miss a thing. Let me repeat myself. That…is…all…that…happened.  
  
  Why, did you hear something else?  
  
  A shiver races up my spine.  
  
  Yes, I did. We all did.  
  
  Well, you’re right. Something did happen. Justin grabbed my hand, we walked over to the swings, and we swung. Then he kissed me again the very same way.  
  
  Then? And then, Hannah? What happened then?  
  
  Then…we left. He went one way. I went the other.  
  
  Oh. So sorry. You wanted something sexier, didn’t you? You wanted to hear how my itchy little fingers started playing with his zipper. You wanted to hear…

I already own basic kitchen scale and kettle so I would prefer spending the rest on grinder. Would some of the Timemore manual grinders be the best option to fit the budget?

For a newbie, is it easier to use Hario or Chemex?

1l856me,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/comments/1l856me/over_a_year_out_and_heres_what_i_think_helped_and/,Over a year out and here's what I think helped and didn't and my story,"Title says basically what I'm discussing here. It's long but over a year is a lot to get down. Meniere's as we all know is a little different for each person but I just wanted to put down in writing my experience in hopes that it helps someone else. 

I'm 30 years old (f) and pregnant with my 3rd baby. My symptoms started beginning  
of 2024 when I was about 2-3 months postpartum with my 2nd baby. I have had a  
history of tinnitus but never anything else. My symptoms started with tinnitus  
and ear fullness though I didn't know fullness was a thing at the time. My  
first episode happened a little less than a month after the ear ringing began  
and lasted close to about 12 hours. From there I had about 1-2 episodes a week  
starting roughly a month after my 1st episode. Scared the daylights out of me  
and my husband as we had a newborn and toddler to take care of. I did a steroid  
pack roughly the end of March and that helped clear things up for about a  
month. I saw an ENT around May and started a diuretic which I was on for about  
5 or so months. Since the appointment with my ENT and starting the diuretic I  
had about an 1-2 episodes a month. In tandem with the diuretic I started the  
low sodium diet along with the John of Ohio (JOH) supplement regimen.

I stopped the diuretic roughly in Aug-Sep. Why? Because I was a zombie and losing  
weight rapidly. Thankfully I had a lot of baby weight to lose but it was  
becoming concerning how awful I was feeling. I also do my best to avoid any  
long term medications unless completely necessary. This is obviously a personal  
preference. 

The next path I've tried is DTR (disclusion time reduction) therapy roughly at the  
end of 2024. It's dental related. My reasoning for trying this particular path  
is because I have had a bit of dental work done over the years and know my bite  
isn't perfect. I also knew that even if I saw no benefits from this for  
Meniere's it couldn't hurt my overall health in the long run. This started  
right around the time I got pregnant with our 3rd baby so the results in  
relation to Meniere's are skewed. I'm going back for follow up appointments  
after the baby is born to check on progress and readjust if necessary. During  
this time I was working out a bit but I stopped tracking my sodium (more on  
that later).

This pregnancy threw me for a bit of a loop. As most know, the 1st trimester is the  
hardest when it comes to nausea and food aversions. When tracking my sodium I  
was very strict on clean eating. Minimal processed foods and basically no  
eating out. By Nov 2024 I had not had an episode in over a month which was very  
exciting for us. The only thing that happened was my ear would get really  
really loud for about 12 hours and then silent for a few days and slowly build  
again. The 1st trimester I ate or didn't eat pretty much whatever I wanted  
sodium be damned. I still had ear fullness and ringing but nothing too extreme.  
I thought I was in the clear and that pregnancy had made my Meniere’s go away.

I was wrong. Close to the end of my 2^(nd) trimester my crappy eating habits had caught back up to me and I had an episode in the evening. This scared the crap out of me more so than before. My episodes always caused me to throw up at some point and I knew being pregnant that was not an option. So I buckled down again and started eating clean. Gluten free mainly with minimal processed foods and lower in carbs. I did not however track and sodium and here is why. 

About mid February of this year I started seeing an upper cervical chiropractor. It’s a specific certification and I have to drive an hour to the office each way but I think its worth it. We did some head x-rays and I was severely out of alignment. They usually say with in the 1^(st) few adjustments you notice a difference but mine wasn’t necessarily the case. I stuck with it, and after about a month or so of adjustments ranging from twice a week to then once a week I started to notice clearing in my bad ear. The tinnitus was still there but the fullness was decreased. Not completely gone but better. During this time we have been discussing the vagus nerve and its relation to inflammation. This is important for my particular situation because I may be 30 years old and appear fit and health but that is completely due to a high metabolism. I was eating really really poorly for basically my whole life up to this point. Just to give an example I’d eat a “son of a baconator” meal from Wendy’s twice A DAY for lunch and dinner. I honestly thought I was untouchable. Clearly not. 

So here’s where I’m left at today. I have minimal ringing and slight fullness in my bad ear. Occasionally I have dizzy spells that last no more than 10-20 seconds. I eat a clean diet consisting mostly of meats, veggies, and some dairy. One thing I didn’t focus too much on explaining was hydration. I was drinking anywhere from 160-200oz  of water a day mid 2024. I’m now down to about 80-120oz of water but do notice if I get hungry or dehydrated it makes me spin some. I avoid coffee already because I’m pregnant but will probably be continuing to abstain. I eat chocolate mainly in the form of a protein shake or 70% dark chocolate in the evening. 

My theory is my case specifically has to do with my gut health and inflammation of the vagus nerve relating to it. The upper cervical chiropractor has helped create some needed space around the vagus nerve to releave some pressure and my diet changes have helped decrease the inflammation. If I continue to stay stagnant and have made no other improvements I can say I’d be satisfied with the outcome. I will continue to see the chiropractor after I give birth to receive a full assessment and adjustment as it is not possible currently. If I get worse, I plan to take a deeper dive into SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth) and candida overgrowth and really try and hone in on my eating. If that doesn’t work I’ll probably start looking at other alternatives such as an antihistamine or antiviral. I’ll also probably get back on a regular workout routine. This is all obviously my own personal experience and may not be for others but I just wanted to give my story in case it gives someone an idea or a different path to try.

TL;DR:

Here’s what I think worked for me. Eating clean, gluten free minimally processed with occasionally eating out but still gluten free and fresh. Upper cervical chiropractor helped create space for inflammation from my vagus nerve to relax. Inflammation is probably caused by poor diet for so long. I think its gut related, at least for my case.

Tried:

·      Diuretic: Didn’t do anything but make me lose my appetite and make me a zombie

·      John of Ohio Regimen: Could have helped but I was on the diuretic at the same time so its inconclusive. Might try again later if symptoms flair up again

·      Low Sodium: The sodium restricting I think is pointless, I think the bigger thing is to eat clean and minimally processed

·      DTR Therapy: Inconclusive because of pregnancy, but will continue after to see if it makes a difference

·      Upper Cervical Chiropractic: The most helpful thing I’ve found thus far but needs to be done in tandem with eating clean to reduce inflammation

 

Will Try If Needed:

·      Antihistamine

·      Antiviral

·      Regular workout plans",1,1749577457.0,Menieres,0,1.0,False

Yes, stalker vibes here because I’ve been on the hunt for a perfume that smells like Ananya Perfume Oil from The Body Shop for 20 years. This was a beast of a sweet, fruity, fresh yet creamy, floral scent that could’ve knocked out a horse from 20 miles. My mother hated it because it gave her a headache, damn, it even gave me a headache. But that didn’t stop teenage me from dousing myself in it, whilst triple layering my Rimmel coffee shimmer lipstick. But it was so different and it was SO beautiful and I shan’t be told different! Despite a description of notes and aromas that never seemed to match up on the ongoing hunt, this holy grail of the 90s has remained ever elusive. And here I am! I found you! Excited much? Oh yes!

So now I can’t properly review Valaya Exclusif. My scent memory has kicked my nostrils right in the emotional feels. My nose enjoys ambroxan but it’s a struggle to describe the dry down because my brain is fixated on Ananya. There’s creamy vanilla, yet fresh slight woodiness from the Akigalawood yet it’s sweet and clean. This doesn’t have the powering strength of Ananya, it’s delicate in comparison and defo more sophisticated with a powdery, milky cashmere edge to it… maybe it’s an Ananya for grown ups?

Collection Status: this was a sample. And I’m not even sure if I like it, hell, I’m not even sure if I’d like Ananya if I smelt it for the first time today. But my emotional brain and hungry nose is telling me to buy it. My practical side that says I’ve already got too many perfumes, with its finger ever on the pulse of my bank balance, is telling me that a PDM is too much just for the sake of nostalgia. Send help!

SW: 172
CW: 164
GW: 130-140 (just in that range)
Height: 5’7”

Kit 2: Bupropion, Naltrexone with B12, metformin 

*Positives:* forced to eat healthier, only eat when hungry or necessary, I don’t crave alcohol and yesterday I actually FORGOT to drink coffee and was fine. As a former barista for 10 years and manager of a shop for 6ish of those years, that’s insane for me

Side effects: constipation, fatigue, nausea

*tl;dr:*
*lots of fiber from oats, whole grains, veggies and fruit for constipation - epsom salt or other laxative for a hard “restart” but don’t rely on it
*for fatigue and nausea, *ALWAYS EAT* with the meds, even if not terribly hungry, especially for the metformin- oatmeal works great for being full and getting fiber in


*Constipation* is the WORST. I knew it was coming, but my fiber intake was not as good as I thought it was. I have always consumed an extraordinary amount of water - I have a 40oz bottle that I drink 2-4 times a day depending on how active I am and I’ve been doing that for a very long time. And I drink a lot of coffee

I was so focused on protein, that’s mostly what I was eating, which can make it worse if not balanced.

Took 2 teaspoons of epsom salt last night and I swear I dropped 3lbs lol. Felt amazing! (Took about 2-3 hours to work and was “going” for about .5-1 hour, but I didn’t really time it.) Smooth move tea did nothing for me.

*Solution:*
-Shoot for 30-35g of fiber instead of 20-25
-More veggies and fruit and not just fiber from carbs
-Hard “reset” when needed, but avoiding unless totally necessary 

The *fatigue and nausea* came after I started taking the metformin and did so on an empty or almost empty stomach since I don’t usually eat in the mornings.
I believe that comes from metformin lowering blood sugar levels and since I don’t have diabetes, I’ve never had to manage or think about that before.

*Solution:*
-Don’t take it until I EAT, even if it’s later than I want it to be, absolutely no exceptions
-I’ve found that oatmeal in the morning works GREAT for keeping blood sugar steady and provides fiber and a full stomach to take the meds with
-when in a pinch, like at work when I forget my meal prep, I typically have some apple cider on hand to take before a carby meal, which is supposed to regulate blood sugar (not sure how science backed that is, but it seems to work fine)
-fewer bready carbs and more whole grains with the protein and veggies

Also, did you know that white rice, when cooled and then reheated, actually creates resistant starch and behaves more like fiber and has less of an impact on blood sugar?? I didn’t, but it’s good to know if that’s what you have on hand. (I accidentally ordered a 25lb bag of jasmine rice from Costco, so I eat a lot of it lol)

Anyways, I hope that’s helpful for someone else! Funny how these meds seem to work by forcing me to eat healthy and pay attention to macros in order to feel my best. Really trains the mind and body on what to do when not on medication, which is my personal main goal.

I’m just ranting really but it’s so unfair that a lot of the ‘respectable’ jobs that allow you to earn a decent salary are so unsuited to people with adhd (I know some can manage but my adhd makes it impossible).

Thicker slabs offer greater strength and can support heavier loads,making them suitable for larger islands or countertops with extended overhangs.**color and Finish:** the base color of Calacatta Gold quartz is a bright, crisp white.the quality of the white background is paramount, as it directly influences the impact of the gold veining.

I'm looking for an upgrade from the Breville Infuser (or Solis Cafespresso, since I bought it in Switzerland). 

I very much prefer the only material along the water path to be stainless steel.

I decided to not complicate my life with pressure/flow profiling, but at least I'd love the ability to lower to 6 bar flat for very light roasts.

I do milk drinks as well, would love more pressure than the Breville (and more importantly more predictability, the steam pressure from the Breville can be quite erratic and frustrating). 

There would be many options that fit the above, but the complicated part is: I'd like it to go from off to ready for optimal brewing in less than 5 minutes. The reason is I don't really want to keep it on every day from 07:00 to 15:00. I could be convinced to do that if there are data about the energy consumption and it is not that bad, but I would love the ability to have coffee on a whim at any time during the morning and late afternoon.

For additional context: I own a Baratze Sette 270Wi, but I plan to upgrade that too. I was tempted to go for a Lagom P64, but not sure I am ready to fully give up the hopper (I occasionally single dose light roasted beans, but I find myself using the hopper a lot on medium roasted beans for milk drinks). Fiorenzato All Ground Sense is looking good to me right now.

After using Linux for a few weeks, I’ve noticed that overall performance feels a bit slower compared to Windows, especially from booting up to using the browser and terminal.

A few specific things I’ve observed:

* After booting and entering my password at the lock screen, there’s a black screen that stays for about 3-4 seconds before the desktop appears. Is this normal or a sign of an issue with my setup?
* I mostly resume from hibernation, which works fine and boots quickly.
* However, after a full restart or shutdown, the boot process feels noticeably slower than Windows.
* I've been using Chrome since the early days of the internet, so I'm well aware of how much RAM it consumes. On average, I used to keep around 6–8 tabs open. Recently, I switched to Linux and started using Firefox. Changing browsers wasn't a big deal since I was already switching operating systems. However, I've noticed that Firefox sometimes freezes too—it's only happened twice so far, but it's still a concern.
* sometime i click on app icon(anydesk in my case) and it doesn't open or work correctly.

I’d appreciate any advice or insights to help me understand if this is normal or if something can be optimized.

The presence of U.S. military bases on our soil isn't the safety net we've been led to believe it is. Instead, it's a potential threat lurking in our own backyards. The recent deployment of American military forces against civilian protesters in the United States should be a glaring red flag for all of us. It's time for a paradigm shift in how we view this military presence.

For decades, we've been conditioned to see the U.S. military as a protective shield, a necessary ally in our collective defense against external threats. But let's not kid ourselves any longer. The sight of military personnel, trained for combat, being used to quell civil unrest within America is not just disturbing; it's a stark reminder of how quickly the narrative can change. If the U.S. government is willing to turn its military inward, what's to stop them from using that same power in ways that could threaten our sovereignty and values?

We need to stop viewing this military presence as a crutch and start seeing it for what it truly is: a potential risk to our independence and democratic principles. The idea that we need foreign troops to ensure our security is not just outdated; it's dangerous. It undermines our ability to govern ourselves and makes us complicit in actions that we might not fully control or endorse.

Imagine, for a moment, a Europe that takes full responsibility for its own defense. A Europe that invests in its military capabilities and fosters cooperation among its member states. This isn't just a pipe dream; it's a viable and necessary alternative to our current reliance on the U.S. military. By strengthening our own defense mechanisms, we can ensure that our security aligns with our values and interests, without the looming shadow of external forces that may not always have our best interests at heart.

But here's the kicker: by allowing U.S. military bases to remain, we're not just risking our sovereignty; we're potentially enabling a force that has shown a willingness to use military power against its own people. This is not the kind of ally we want or need. It's time to take a stand and show the world that Europe is capable of defending itself and its principles.

So, let's not wait for the next wake-up call. The urgency of the situation demands immediate action. We must push for the removal of U.S. military bases from our soil and invest in a future where Europe's security is in Europe's hands. It's time to reclaim our independence and ensure that our defense strategies reflect our commitment to democracy, sovereignty, and peace.

1l84lfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l84lfz/crave_the_hidden_biology_of_addiction_and_cancer/,"Crave: The Hidden Biology of Addiction and Cancer is the nonfiction book that made me rethink my coffee, my phone, and why I always need to be doing something","I picked up Crave expecting a science book about cancer. What I got was a hard look at modern life. The argument is not that addiction is just about drugs or trauma. It is that craving itself has become part of everyday survival. Sugar, caffeine, social media, validation, even overwork. All of it.

The book makes the case that chronic craving overwhelms the systems that usually protect us. The immune system. Hormone regulation. Cellular repair. The more we chase the next hit of stimulation, the more we fall behind on long-term maintenance. Over time, this leaves the body vulnerable to disease. Cancer becomes more likely not because of one bad habit, but because of a lifestyle that never allows rest or repair.

One part that stuck with me was the idea that food, work, and even relationships are now shaped by the need to feel something all the time. We no longer eat to nourish, we eat to escape. We do not rest, we distract ourselves. We do not connect, we perform.

Another passage that hit hard was about inflammation. The author describes how constant low-level stress can quietly push the body into a pro-cancer state. Not in a dramatic way, but in a slow buildup of risk that we never notice.

This is not a book that gives you five steps to fix your life. It does not preach. It observes. It builds a case that the modern world itself is addictive, and that this addiction is making us sick in ways we do not see until it is too late.

If you have ever felt exhausted by your own habits but unsure why, or if you have wondered why cancer rates remain high despite all the medical progress, read Crave. It will not comfort you, but it might wake you up.",13,1749576118.0,booksuggestions,2,0.92,False

I have spent 2 years in call focused IT Helpdesk. One year with the Apple college program, and one for a smaller business. The smaller business is my current job. 

I work on a team of about 4-5 people and we manage a LARGE number of users. I’d say around 5k+. We recently lost the Helpdesk manager a few months ago, so our whole IT department is me and 4 other 20 year olds lmao. After losing the manager, two of my coworkers were promoted to team lead. They are my seniors, so it made sense. However, now they are constantly being pulled away for bullshit meetings and other things. This puts a strain on the call queue, as we lose 2 people for hours at a time. There are easy and hard days obviously, but lately I’ve found that every day is hard for me. Even if it’s slow, I don’t want to answer any calls. I’m tired of resetting passwords for the same users everyday. I’m tired of dealing with users who don’t listen. I’m tired of dealing with machines from the Obama administration. I make $17 an hour after my yearly raise of about 50 cent. I’m glad to even get a raise, (and to even have a job) but the pay doesn’t feel like it matches the shit I deal with. This company shells out thousands for dumb shit like weekly lunches and dinners and a new coffee bar in the break room, but purchases the cheapest computers that are god awful to work with. I’m not excited to come to work anymore. I’ve been late the past week because I literally don’t want to get out of bed. I stay up all night until 11pm because going to sleep means I have to wake up and do it all again. I hate working in this office and having to walk around and smile all day because god forbid you don’t tell Linda good morning. 

I don’t have many options. I live in rural NC, and there isn’t another IT job in my direct area. I interviewed for a job about an hour away for significantly more money, but that would mean commuting.

Woodlands was great from the start at online check in. Checked in online, then messaged for an upgrade as a Gold Elite (was previous platinum but our travel reduced for a few years, now back at it). Upgraded within minutes via chat to a water view king balcony (booked a standard king room). The free complimentary parking garage around the corner has a skybridge (air conditioned thankfully) to the hotel. Was also able to take advantage of bonus promotion for weekend stays for both bookings (additional 5k points).  Woodlands was very nice, great areas for relaxing within the hotel. Breakfast was better than most but still lacked in some ways. The bar had good service and drinks. Front desk agents were exceptional in customer service. Some of the best I've seen in in awhile.  Overall great stay and right on top of music venue (Cynthia Woods Pavilion our reason for being there) . Very good restaurants in the area (Charm Thai Restaurant was amazing). The only annoyance was the sliding door to the balcony, very hard to open, didn't want to slide. 

La Concha Key West, we arrived day after Memorial Day. When checking in online, was not able to upgrade ""due to availability"" when I checked the website there were still upgraded rooms for our time there, so I don't know what was going on there. Though they did give us a bottle of champagne as a welcome gift.  The staff was excellent the entire time.  Front desk explained the $30 day resort fee which you get back as a credit for any of the 3 establishments, (bar, Perla and El Dom )Once we were checked in and dropped bags in the room headed down to the bar to get a drink and some food. Mojitos were outstanding and we got the Cubano bites (Cuban sandwich cut up 4 ways) and the steak street tacos (2). Tacos were amazing, probably the best we've ever had.   Pool and pool bar were great, able to get food there if you wanted. No problems getting chairs. Close to everything from the Hotel, was able to walk everywhere for the most part. Concierge hooked us up with a pedicab for a reservation a little further way and the guy was great. We used him a few more times. Everything we ate there at the hotel was great. Breakfast at Perla, coffee and breakfast sandwiches at El Dom and bar food. I think we ate the street tacos everyday! LOL.  We very much enjoyed our stay, I know there were some issues after the renovation and with the resort credit but it seems to have been clarified now.    Only issue, but added character I think, in the bathroom the paint was peeling on the ceiling, but that happens with hundred year old historic building made of concrete due to the humidity. The rooms are smaller but very nice. the suites are much larger and newer on top of the hotel. We were on Duval street side on 6th floor and weren't bothered by noise outside. Beautiful hotel through and through, especially if you like the period aesthetic . Highly recommend both hotels. Staff were wonderful at both. ",2,1749575968.0,marriott,0,1.0,False

I don’t know why (maybe just wedding stress?) but I’ve been very worried about not having enough food, dessert, guests will get bored, etc. I would like to get your perspective on whether you would enjoy the wedding if you were a guest.

Our ceremony starts at 3:30pm, guests are welcomed to arrive at 3pm. I don’t want guests to just hang around without anything to drink/snack on so I’m having a self serve Viet coffee & winter melon tea (Should I hire a barista instead of doing self serve?). We’re setting a custom made silk handkerchief (one of our guest favors) on each chair at the ceremony. Short and sweet ceremony as we don’t have bridal party.

After ceremony, we’ll have a 1hr cocktail hour with passed appetizers, open bar, Viet coffee & tea, a keychain building station (I’ll have 4-5 charms for guests to make keychains, this is the other part of the favors), string quartet, and a photobooth.

For our reception, we’ll have plated style dinner (with lots of servers to ensure things move smoothly), with table side drink services, no toasts, only a welcome speech from B&G, 2min first dance, very quick cake cutting (we’re having a small cake for us, we’re not serving cake to guests), then the dessert table is opened to guests to enjoy. We’ll have 5 different desserts for guests to choose. Ofcourse DJ and dancing. Photobooth will stay opened until 8pm. Open bar with beer, wine, cocktails, mocktails. No send off. Party will end at 9pm since it’s a sunday. 

About 60% of our guests are from out of state but due to our busy schedules (FH is a physician and I’m a scientist), we won’t be able to host a welcome party which I kinda feel bad about. Lots of them have very limited time off as they’re physicians, doing their fellowships, or residents so the fact that they’re traveling and taking time off for us means a lot to us and we would like to give them a good experience as a thank you. 

What else should I add to the wedding to make sure our guests will have a good time? The wedding will be outdoor, is there anything I should do to make our guests comfortable, except proving fans & umbrellas?",5,1749575959.0,weddingplanning,13,1.0,False

Look around you. You are not in some distant land, you are in Los Angeles, a city not of strangers, but of neighbors. You stand not among enemies, but among your own.

You trained to defend this country, to uphold the Constitution, to protect against all enemies — foreign and domestic. You did not pledge allegiance to a man. You pledged it to an idea — that a free people can govern themselves with justice, compassion, and law.

But now, a shadow falls.

A president, consumed by fear and lust for power, has twisted the sacred instruments of our democracy into tools of control. Not for the safety of the people, but to secure his grip on power. He seeks to use you, not as guardians of peace, but as weapons of intimidation. This is not leadership. This is not patriotism. **This is an insurrection cloaked in authority.**

Remember who we are.

We are the ones who pour your coffee in the morning. Who sit beside you at school. Who patch up your uniforms. Who pray for your safety. We are your people, the citizens you swore to protect. We are not the enemy. We are the very heart of this nation.

Stand not with a president who craves dominion, but with the people who crave dignity. You are the sword and shield of liberty, not the fist of tyranny. **If this is the hour we are tested, then let it be said that the Marines, the defenders of our republic, did not forget their oath.**

Is this still salvageable?,"Hello everyone! Just for some context, I have never been in a relationship before. I had a rough time as a teen and after high school my mom was terminally ill so I kinda shut myself off from people for a while. Recently I have moved to a new area near the beach. It’s been alright but I’ve been feeling very lonely from not having any friends or my siblings with me. But I digress. As per the title suggest I have been talking to a girl I met on Hinge for around a few weeks. We matched on the app and have been texting for a while. It’s been very cordial with light flirting. She enjoyed talking to me and I really adore her. We had agreed to meet up at a coffee shop as our first meeting. However the night before, she texted me saying she doesn’t want to do it anymore. She had mentioned briefly before that she had two very bad experiences with men two months ago. She told me that she had spoken to her therapist that day and realized that she was not ready to date again. She assured me several times that it had nothing to do with me and that she thinks I’m an amazing guy. I told her I understood where she was coming from but I think we should still give this a chance. I was very sad and might have went overboard. I told her about how much I liked her and how this was a first experience for me so I wasn’t going to judge her. She still insisted she wasn’t ready. I think she could tell I was very upset but trying to be polite. Right now I think we’re on good terms. She wants to continue texting and I asked if she wanted to maybe try another day down the line which she said she was unsure about, not wanting to repeat this abrupt cancellation. That was our last convo. 

If you’re still with me, thank you for reading all that and letting me get it off my chest. Im posting this because I wanted to know what to do now. Could this still become a relationship with time or is it dead in the water? I’m willing to give her all the space she needs and move at whatever pace she’s comfortable with.

1l84i55,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AbbreviationsFine160/comments/1l84i55/sixty_milespart_1/,Sixty Miles-Part 1,"I awoke from my perilous dreams with a knock. A knock at my door, I look at my watch and saw that it was 3 past 4 a.m. *Who would be knocking on my door at THIS hour?* I thought incessantly. I got up, still half asleep, expecting some sort of solicitor to be at my door, but why would a solicitor come here at 4 a.m.? I shuffled my feet along the marbled wood floor to my door, where the visitor's shadow welcomed me through the window on the door’s right.

I was startled a bit when the shadow peeked inside the window, its frame very tall, and it seemed to have entered my home; looking around for something, or someone.The shadow went back to the door where it waited for my presence. I slowly crept up to the door, the shadow knocked once more, I jumped harshly and hit my right knee on the coffee table next to where I was standing. The whole room was pitch black except for the door, the moonlight peering in. I was able to see a sliver of the room but my main focus was on the door, a stranger waiting on the other side. I walked up to the door and slowly opened it. 

I fully expected to witness a tragedy befalling me. Some kind of horrifying accident or crime. I expected to be robbed, shot, or even worse, a victim of the Heart Street Carver. A serial killer roaming around Heart Street where, he/she, picks victims, (mainly women but a couple men have been found victims themselves) and carves them to pieces, leaving their handiwork on displays in stores or displays around trees (Christmas time), but mainly they find the bodies in allyways. However, I, myself, don’t live on Heart Street, in fact I live a couple streets removed from the main hunting ground of The Carver, but I don’t know if he/she ventures out beyond Heart Street, if any of their victims actually lived on the street or were merely passing by it receiving a stroke of unimaginable bad luck. Was I going to receive such luck? I prepared myself, grabbing a fire poker, ready to swing at my assailant. I opened the door and got a good look at who the shadow belonged to.

I opened the door to find my captain standing on my porch in the night air. “Brian? What are you doing here at 4 in the morning?”

“David, I need your help, let me inside.” He looked excited, happy even. His eyes bulged, it was like a kid’s eyes on Christmas morning. I fully opened my door to him, letting him in my living room where he took a seat and urged me to take the other chai across from him. I did as my captain asked and sat across from him. Stoking the fire with the poker I still had in my hand.

“Why are you here at this hour, Brian?” I repeated. He didn’t answer for but a moment, then he couldn’t stay quiet any longer.

“Have you been keeping up with news lately?” He asked. I looked at him, confused and sort of scared at the way he was acting.

“Not really, no. I’ve been busy the last few days. Why?” I answered honestly. He looked away for a second before turning back with even more glee in his eyes, it was like he was hypnotized.

“I have a mission for us, all of us. It’s a big one.” 

“A mission?” I questioned. We’re fishermen, but not your regular fishermen. You see, we get hired to find fish, not capture them. Our crew gets hired by local marine biologists, who accompany us on our ‘missions’, and we get paid for them using our boat from whatever funds they get from the government. I always wondered where they got their funds from if it was indeed from the government. The only reason I think that is because I stumbled upon them talking to two men in suits who looked FBI. I didn’t hear what they were saying but soon after they left they sent us on a mission to find a rare fish. Now, I know next to nothing about what fish belongs to what species, so I never questioned the missions because we were getting payed very well. I quit after that mission. I never went on a boat since, its been 5 years since I’ve seen Captain Brian and the other crew, hence why I was so shocked to see him at my door, and he wants to offer me a mission. 

“I-I’m sorry, Captain, but I quit a long time ago, you know that.” His face changed from eagerness to sternness.

“Listen to me, David, this is the biggest mission of our entire lives. I can’t do this without my best second-in-command. Please.” 

“Cap, I can’t, I have a ne-”

“DAVID!”, he shot up from his seat and pointed at me, his quick movement startled me, “This is the score we’ve been waiting on for a long time! 50k, David, 50k each!” I was stunned, who would want to hire us for that much money? Why? I decided I needed answers.

“What’s the mission?” I asked curiously. I wanted, no, needed to know what would make someone hire fishermen for 50 grand a person. Brian sat down, the chair moaning slighlty. He reached for his back pocket and pulled out a couple papers. He sat them down on the table. One was a note, detailing the mission, and the other was a map with a red circle drawn on it. The circle was very far away from land.

“Sixty miles, sixty miles out west past these islands”, he started pointing on the map detailing the route we needed to take to get there, how bad the weather may potentially be, and who was coming along. It was only a five-minute conversation but it felt like only seconds and his eyes, Jesus his eyes were bigger than they were before! I only noticed just now but him explaining all the details, it may have aroused him? I don’t think so, but the way he was talking surely made it seem that way. It was strange how his manner of speech changed throughout the explanation. With each second that past during his explanation, his demanor and his manner of speech slowly became more like a childs speech. He stopped speaking for a moment and looked into my eyes. I could see he was waiting on me to ask any question, I stopped for a moment to take in what he said and I aksed away. Hoping he would sate my curiosity.

“Ok, I think I got the gist”, I put my poker down in the empty slot next to the fire where I lost a previous fire poker. I continued, “Brian, listen…”

“Fifty-Thousand dollars, David! Fifty-Thousand Dollars!!” He interrupted. The urgency in his voice has me shaken to the core. I’ve never seen him this excited nor this angry before. 

“Brian, I-ca-” Before I could finish my final rejection, he grabbed me by the shoulders and started to…to…beg…he knelt down like a man on his last legs, begging to be saved by God. He held both of my hands in his and begged me to come along. H-How can I say no? Tears started welling up in his eyes. “F-Fine.” I caved. His eyes lit up as he got off his knees. He was that kid on christmas again. 

“T-thank you, David! I promise you, we’ll be well off with this mission!” His words seemed to me to be, empty. I can’t explain it but I felt that each word coming out his mouth wasn’t *his* words. 

“When’s the day of departure?” His eyes lost their sparkle, they became soulless. Like the moment I said yes, they knew, oh yes they knew, that I wouldn’t back out, couldn’t anymore. It was creepy to say the least. He relieved my discomfort for but a moment when he loked away lost in thought to my question. When he came up with an answer he smiled emptily. A dead smile.

“Tomorrow. We depart tomorrow. Be at Phobos Port by noon.” 

With that he leaves, leaves me in shock and awe of what just happened. I still can’t wrap my head around it. It’s bugging me so much, should I go? Do I have a choice? I am a man who likes to keep his word. I think I’ll sleep on it. Maybe my mind will change in the morning. But that’s not what’s scaring me, what’s scaring me is the prospect that I won’t change my mind tomorrow and I’ll follow through.

So full disclosure I was not raised in the most traditional of ways but I am very observant and religious with my practicing. The only area I fall short on is I don’t cover my hair, but even then I dress conservative for western standards. 

I’m 26 F and have been on the most up and down relationship journey ever. I’ve always wanted to find the right one soon, never thought it would end up taking the turn it has!

You guys I am so done with Muslim/Arab men. One year ago I NEVER thought I would say this. 

But let’s look at my relationship history:

First guy (age 21) —> he came from a very traditional family, completely wore down my confidence over time, narcissistic, would always criticise me for not wearing hijab (I said I would if we got married), made me fall out of love with the religion. So toxic. 

Second guy (ages 22-25) —> started off well but over time we grew apart. He seemed more harsh and judgemental as he became more extreme in religion. Realised I couldn’t do a katb kiteb with him as we were on different pages about the future. 

Now I hate the word ‘dating’ but for guys I’ve not been in relationships with but met who are Muslim/Arab, it’s like the same cycle repeats. They show a lot of interest at first. I am fortunate I do get approached a LOT. But I make it very clear I only want something serious and that religious values are important to me. They make plans, then disappear…. Or they meet me and then ghost… 

So you might be thinking the problem is with me?

Well, so would I but every non Muslim man I’ve ever dated has been the complete opposite!

- They always pay for everything (some of the Muslim guys including my relationships did 50/50)

- Taken me out to incredible places, travelled to see me, really put so much effort in

- Treated me with MORE respect (this surprised me) and much better communication 

- No game playing 

I could go on. 

I realised that a lot of the Muslim guys I’d talk to were still figuring things out and didn’t always have their life together in the same way as non Muslims. Guys I’ve met the same age who are non Muslims are often homeowners and soaring in their career. That’s fine but if you want to raise your family in an Islamic way then you can’t expect your wife to also work full time to contribute to household expenses. 

Another thing is their expectations of women. Muslim Arab guys expect a chaste wife who will do everything yet a lot of them have shady pasts themselves, they won’t answer if they’ve slept with other girls or not (because clearly they have), they admit to having experimented with alcohol and so on. (Although not the two I was in relationships with) But the way they view women can sometimes be distorted. Whereas the non Muslim men don’t put those same cultural expectations or rules on a woman. It’s refreshing. 

Some of you might say the non Muslim guys are only nice because they want to sleep with me. No. I make my intentions very clear from the start that I’m not doing that and I tell them my morals and religious values are #1 importance for me. 

Also I don’t go out with atheist guys. They are always Christian/Jewish in background so share the same morals or respect for God. 

Now all of this said, do I want to end up with a Muslim or a non Muslim?

Of course a Muslim. 

That’s why I gave yet another guy a chance last week. He was Egyptian. He’d been pursuing me for a long time but I was cautious. I vetted him for a while. Finally agreed to let him take me out, but it was just a big mistake. I should have seen the red flags though that he 1) only wanted to meet for coffee then a museum then finally lunch when I proposed that but he kept changing plans. And 2) he asked me to meet him there literally 15 minutes before we were due to meet. But I said no way as guys have always picked me up or arranged transport for me. However I wanted to make it work with a Muslim guy which is why I gave it a chance, and yet again it fell through... 

However I’m so done with them. Whatever happens is in the will of Allah swt but I really do have to say that looking back, and despite what we read online, non Muslim men have always treated me far better and had much healthier mindsets around women/relationships than Muslim men. This is something I NEVER thought I’d say! And of course disclaimer that there are definitely some great Muslim men out there. ",1,1749575687.0,muslimgirlswithtaste,7,0.57,False

1l84dhq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l84dhq,Buy It: $29 Maestri House S3 G Brew Ratio Scale,"$29 on Amazon right now with a $10 off coupon. 

I like this scale better than my $190 Fellow Tally Pro Precision Scale Studio Edition, full stop.

The numbers are larger and easier to read, it’s just as fast at reacting to weight changes as you pour, the buttons are more responsive, the UX is better, and it has a nice audible beep when you reach your ideal ratio weight - and it’s a pleasant beep, loud enough to hear - but never annoy. 

The main value prop of scales that auto-calculate ratios is that you are able to pour your ground coffee into your dripper while it’s on the scale, see the weight of coffee, then push a button and it auto calculates the amount of water you need to pour to hit the ratio you have chosen. My gripe with the fellow, is that it’s easy to forget to hit the timer button and start pouring and then all your ratios get lost and you’re flying blind at that point. It doesn’t happen a lot, but it happens. 

The fellow highlights when you are at the right water weight by highlighting around it in the OLED screen. While this works, you basically have to keep an eye on the screen while you pour - and be less focused on the pour itself. The Maestri gives you that nice single, clear, audible beep AND displays the ratio much larger than the Fellow - which allows you to focus more on your pouring pattern and flow rates (this scale also has a flow rate display - which the Fellow doesn’t) which is far more helpful and pleasant - and actually heightens the experience. 

While some elements of the $190 Fellow have noticeably better build quality, like the metal weighting plate, the metal knob and the OLED display - that’s really it. Even then, I actually like the rubber cover on the Maestri, larger display and more responsive and better feeling buttons - the timer button on the $190 Fellow feels incredibly cheap and taring, turning on/off the Fellow by pushing down the metal knob feels hollow and unpleasant.

Overall - even if these scales were the exact same $29 price, I’d actually choose the Maestri over the Fellow. It’s simply better and more practical to use.

What do you think she'll do afterwards?,"Being an influencer (especially one that is losing popularity) will not provide forever. She's almost 30 with no real work history and limited skills, no higher education, she is immature and often selfish, she doesn't have many interpersonal relationships and therefore undoubtedly has some poor social skills, she doesn't have her priorities straight in general and also prioritizes men, she is irresponsible (like the van incident or driving on a suspended license), she already turned down a job offer from a coffee shop, she's lazy and uses the whole ""my kids school could call at any minute so I can't work"" excuse (which is bullshit), an internet search will bring up her MANY scandals, she's chronically online, appears to have no legit long term goals and is aimless beyond taking pictures and hanging out with men, has an ego and relies on her looks and getting validation, instead of authentic and serious her actions show that she's almost always performative in the things she does, and she's delulu and lives in lala land.

Who would even want to hire her? She's qualified for nothing. She'd definitely shot herself in the foot perpetually relying on Internet popularity.

So, in the future, I assume more than anything she'll try to bag a man with money to avoid working (especially with 3 kids), she will continue to pursue internet popularity in anyway she can (especially if she can monetize it) and fantasize about her Tumblr days when she peaked, she'll beg for money, get on public assistance especially if she's legally single (not that public assistance is necessarily wrong), and try to make money off of more roommates. I see her bouncing from job to job no matter what it is or how easy it is. She's the type that would complain about getting up early, call out often because she isn't experienced with schedules, would come up with all kinds of excuses for poor performance, couldn't handle constructive criticism, would have low motivation and ambition, likely would think she's ""above"" certain jobs/things/tasks, and would easily give up if she thinks something is ""too hard"". She'd use ADHD and her kids for excuses and possibly exploit Rosie's disability.

What do you think?

And any jobs you think she could do? I feel like she'd try to make am embarrassing Model Mayhem profile and do a trade show at best lol. Or pursue more sex work (although no shame to sex workers in general but she's not even popular on OF). She'll mooch off people if she can. I could also see her setting up a Gofund me and use her kids as an excuse. Or maybe to find reasons (or make up reasons) to sue somebody and get a settlement because she's always the ""victim"". She'd definitely only work part-time. She could try out entry level jobs though, like waitressing or catering. Maybe call up that coffee shop again. Maybe give DoorDash another try. She could get a weekend job at a winery to facilitate wine tastings, she could be a carny for games at the county fair (lmao), she could maybe edit photos for actually popular influencers or something like that, she could see about helping a small company with their business social media posts, or she could see about a flower shop since it fits her ""aesthetic"" (although she really should stop caring so much about that). That's all I can think of at the moment but I doubt she'd do them anyway (or be a good candidate to an employer). I don't think she'd go back to school for anything.

I was going to say being a reseller on apps like Poshmark, but apparently she tried something like that before and never shipped the items. I thought about adding babysitter or pet sitter but she neglects both children and animals.

Okay- so I have had a lot of dental issues my whole life and only recently have I started to put the pieces together to understand why I had a lot of cavities/ gum issues growing up! 

I’m in my thirties now; but I got diagnosed with adhd a few years ago and subsequently hypermobility and fibro. I didn’t realize that my teeth were connected to the hypermobility issues. Whenever I would get cavities (which I got a lot of a re cavities on those) I would need a lot of freezing to get through.

Growing up I broke my front tooth a bunch of times as you can probably see how bad it looks now. I’m also on adhd medications which I think are making my teeth look worse? 

I don’t smoke I don’t drink alcohol I only drink decaf coffee but I know there are other things that stain your teeth. I just want to feel confident again with my smile. 

Where do I begin? What do I do? 

I had braces twice growing up. The first time when I was 10 or something and off when I was 12 and again after that around the same time. 

I had a bottom wire and recently took that off. I never had a retainer for the top. But my top right tooth had moved as you can see it’s higher and turned. 

I had the images done to start Invisalign and I don’t know if I want to start there. I just don’t know what to do. Where to start. 

My teeth are making me feel really insecure. I don’t want to smile. My smile is on an angle, I can’t stand my front tooth, and now they’re so yellow or more noticeable for me at least. I started using crest 3D white and perhaps that’s making my front tooth look worse? 

I just don’t know where to start. It’s all overwhelming. Invisalign and then do I do veneers? Then whitening? And I know it’s an investment in myself with whatever I do and I know things aren’t cheap so that’s why I’m so overwhelmed and I want to just feel confident in my smile.

Do I start w Invisalign? Do I have to do Invisalign before I fix my front tooth? Can I white before or do I really need to wait til all of this is done to whiten my teeth?

## Key Features Analysis

The best blanket coats should offer a combination of comfort, style, and durability. Here are some key features to consider when making your purchase.

**Material Quality and Composition**

The material of a blanket coat is paramount, determining its warmth, drape, and overall aesthetic. Look for fabrics that are soft against the skin and provide adequate insulation.Wool, cashmere, and high-quality synthetic blends like fleece or recycled polyester are excellent choices. The specific composition will influence the coat's weight, warmth, and care requirements; a higher percentage of natural fibers often translates to superior comfort and breathability.

A blend of wool and cashmere offers a luxurious feel and remarkable warmth perfect for colder climates. Recycled polyester or fleece lining adds an extra layer of insulation and can be an eco-friendly choice. Consider the type of fabric best suited to your climate and personal preferences.

**Design and Style**

Blanket coats come in a variety of designs, from oversized wraps to structured, tailored silhouettes. Consider your personal style and the occasions for which you plan to wear the coat. Wrap styles are inherently casual and offer a relaxed, bohemian vibe, while more structured designs provide a polished, complex look. look for details such as fringe, tassels, geometric patterns, or solid colors to complement your existing wardrobe.
 
The cut and drape should flatter your body shape. A well-designed blanket coat will fall gracefully and accentuate your best features. Pay attention to the length of the coat as well; longer styles offer greater coverage and warmth, while shorter styles can be more practical for everyday wear.**Construction and Stitching**

The quality of the coat's construction is a direct indicator of its durability and longevity. Examine the stitching carefully, ensuring that seams are securely sewn and reinforced where necessary. Look for clean, even stitches, with no loose threads or frayed edges. High-quality blanket coats often feature reinforced seams at stress points, such as the shoulders and armholes, to prevent tearing or wear over time.

Durable closures such as sturdy buttons or a well-made belt will keep your coat securely in place. A good quality lining, if the coat is lined, adds comfort and protects the outer fabric.

**size and Fit**

Getting the right size is crucial for achieving the desired look and comfort. Blanket coats are typically designed to be oversized, but it's critically important to find a balance between a relaxed fit and one that overwhelms your frame. Check the manufacturer's sizing chart and read customer reviews to get an accurate sense of how the coat runs. Consider your height and shoulder width when selecting a size, and factor in any layers you plan to wear underneath.

If possible, try on the coat before purchasing to ensure it fits well and drapes properly. Remember that the goal is to create a stylish,agreeable silhouette,not to be buried under a mountain of fabric.

**Warmth and Insulation**

The primary function of a blanket coat is to provide warmth. Consider the climate in which you live and the level of insulation you require. Thicker materials, such as wool blends with a high percentage of wool or quilted linings, offer greater warmth then lighter fabrics. Blanket coats with hoods are a good option for colder climates as well,providing extra protection from the elements.

Evaluate the overall thermal properties of the coat based on the material composition and construction. Check if the coat is designed for layering, which can enhance its versatility for different weather conditions.

Second thoughts and libido incompatiblity?","My life is packed with stress the past few years - depsite having a safe and loving relationship, our own apartment, and good groups of friends.. I'm plagued by social anxiety, occasional depression, the general weight of the world, and juggling finances w/ hobbies and a busy social/performance arts life - yet the most prevalent concern on my mind the past few months.. has been how my brain is thinking about my partner of almos6 6 years. He's wonderful, yet I have occasional thoughts (becoming more frequent, like mutliple times a week now) that he isn't the one? And it's fucking me up inside, they're similar to the thoughts I had before finally breaking it off for good with my last long-term partner (who was incredibly toxic) but this one is the first healthy partner I've ever really had... so I keep trying to combat the thoughts with logic, but something still feels horribly amiss.

I have a valid concern about our libidos being incompatible.. As I don't *need* sex to be happy, and usually get the drive to about once a week (at least in my current state of stress) if I'm prime happy & content, or ovulating lol - it can be much more. But once a week has been pretty common, and that isn't enough for him... We've had talks, we're both very good at communicating honestly with one another and not getting too upset/lashing out (SO fucking grateful for that - every ex I've had I couldn't be heard & not screamed at) but with the subject of sex - he can't seem to see my side. 

I'm absolutely on the spectrum, and often get overstimulated with too much touch or noise (working to be better) but I find that anytime he touches me, it's with intent to be sexual - or at least that he wants it to potentially escalate to such. And that has me shying away from touch in general, as I don't want to feel like a sex object or bang every second of the day.. it turns me off and extends the countdown for when I *could* be interested, since I just want a hug or smooch from my partner, and he's trying to grope titty or suck face every time. 😥 It stresses me tf out..

He's specifically said if we aren't banging enough or if he's rejected (even soft and kindly) he feels ugly, unloved, like I'll break up with him, etc... And now he's putting himself in the ""rejected"" mindset pretty much any time we lay next to one another, as he immediately goes to grab my hips or tits in hopes of escalating things.. and I was hoping just to be held or rubbed with genuine love - and am now locked down and uncomfy because it was so sudden (though I now expect it) and it makes me less eager to even initiate cuddling.. yet I know we both crave sweet platonic or romantic touch that isn't sexual (though he won't admit it) and that is a crucial thing for *me* to have before I'll want to be sexual... 😟

I know our brains are very different in this sense... I so very much want him to feel loved - I do my damndest in all the ways I can, I tell him he's handsome (and mean it), give him back massages after work, make him coffee, listen to his vents & comfort him, keep the house clean, make him art, leave him sweet notes to wake up to, send him hot lewds.. I want to try and show a little more PDA when we're out with friends because that's never been something natural to me, but he likes it and wants to feel like I'm showing him off n such,  so I'm trying to improve that. ♡ And I'm trying to be more willing to the idea of banging more frequently/urging my brain into horny when it wasn't initially.. but damn, with all my brains stressors, it can be hard. :( 

I'm trying to do better, truly, esp cuz he said he doesn't feel loved without it (wild concept to me, but it's his brain) and now it's just becoming another weight on me, feeling like I *HAVE* to find time and force myself to bang him multiple times a week, and that's not how I want to be having sex, dude... 😥 It shouldn't feel forced, or like a chore - I don't want to resent him over it. I also don't want to feel like a sex object and like nothing I do matters if we didn't bang recently enough.. Like I have no value in his life otherwise (which I know isn't true) but fuck - it's aparrent as hell when he immediately feels me up while cuddling, and I don't escalate into horny mode because I just wanted to be close for a few mins before being groped.... (I may have been into it like 30mins later - but not 1 second in, you know) and he takes the lack of immediate reciprocation as rejection. His mood will entirely flip, he radiates depression & bitterness, will pull his hands away and bury his face into the couch. Not watch the movie or want to talk now (has a lifeless voice when he does and I ask ""what's wrong love?"" he'll say ""nothing, I'm fine"" in a dull growl and then try to sleep) he was in a perfectly jovial and loving mood before.. and now he's withdrawn *all* touch and affection from me - which feels absolutely godawful - I can't put it to words. It makes me feel like he doesn't want to hold or love me unless we were going to bang??

 We're engaged and had a fairytale like love the first few years of our relationship.. we play video games together, have similar interests, have sweet and hot and communicative sex when we do, we don't yell at eachother, all of these wonderful things that I haven't had with other partners... It should be a romantic dream of a partnership, right?

But when he does this, I feel so fucking unloved and unvalued, it breaks my heart each time.. and it's so passive on his part I don't know how to discuss it? He can have anger issues and lash out about things (he's yet to do it *to* me, but I worry ofc from my other relationship's trauma - and I have seem him get loud and irate about other things, at the cats, etc) and he does struggle with depression.. 

I *really* don't want to put him in a negative self-hating spiral, or have him feel like I'm attacking him by bringing up this behavior.
But I also feel like it's tearing my soul apart and makes me dread being intimate with him a little more each time.. My heart also has the tendency to detach when it feels that kind of heartbreak - so each time this happens, out of self preservation it pulls back a bit, and I hate it... I feel like our libido is just incompatible at this point. 😟 and it sucks, because he's so good otherwise, we're friends as well as lovers, and when we do bang it's amazing.. But my brain, more each week that passes (and looking at the life we've put so much effort into building so far - tears in my eyes in regards) is thinking, maybe this isn't it.. Maybe I should stop wasting both our time/torturing us both and move on? 😓 I don't fucking know, dude. But he doesn't deserve the self-loathing and sad slumps my low libido puts on him.. and the hot n cold heartache of being loved/being cold-shouldered + the stress of sexual duties I need to uphold is tearing me in two.

** I am also concerned (but less so) about things like; we disagree on some social issues (he's much more right leaning than I) and I do get a bitter taste in my mouth at some of those insensitivities.. But generally when we have those discussions, neither of us get too heated and can kinda agree on some bits, though I am mildly concerned at time that may build up to more incompatiblity as well. But I'm also a steadfast lover (who has a history of hanging on *too long* tbh, which is why I'm having thoughts) and despite being a milennial, I believe in working to keep someone you love despite mild conflict here and there. Honest communication and effort from both sides is key.

I apologize for the insanely lengthy vent.. Kudos to anyone who reads (or even skims) this far.

TLDR: My partner is unsatisfied with 1 p/wk bangs, and has expressed he feels unloved, ugly, etc. when we don't hook up enough. He'll withdraw touch from me, pout and get pissy/bury himself in couch when I don't reciprocate.. I feel sexualized / objectified since every time he touches me it's trying to initiate sex. Don't want sex to feel like a chore/hold resentment, also do my best to show him he's loved in every other way.. Worried we are incompatible. 
Relationship is good and seemingly healthy otherwise? 💀

Edit: I have told him that my libido is greatly increased when other needs are met; I get some romantic or platonic touch, quality time, good laughs in together, etc.. I think he just spaces on it because he's *always horny for me* (his words) and I think he feels hurt/takes it personally that I'm not the same? I tried to explain to him that I'm demisexual (he thinks that's made-up liberal attention-seeking terminology 🫠 r.i.p.) but I find him attractive 100% of the time - that doesn't mean I'm also horny / wanna bang all the time? which doesn't compute to him.

He also seems to forget (though I remind him constantly) that just grabbing my tits or hips is very jolting sensually when I haven't been warmed up with other touch first? He just says he likes to grab them, but I think doesn't believe me that they're sensitive in a not good way if we haven't been touching or getting riled up otherwise first.? 

When we are beginning to bang, he's very sweet, communicative, makes sure I'm not hurt, always makes sure I finish (usually multiple times) before he does. It's just the emotional weight/need for frequency of sex that is the struggle.",1,1749575340.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Although, I personally feel a couple things were a hit or a miss, it's definitely a must try if you've never had Singaporean/Malay food. The menu is not very vast, but a good introduction. I also tried the Ice Kopi here which is basically iced coffee and it was amazing. Strong coffee taste with a hint of a smokey flavour and adequately sweet.

Must gets here:
1. Char Siu Pork - Heavenly. However, I did send back the order we first recieved as it was too chewy, the second order was much better but the taste was simply amazing.
2. Malay Fried Chicken (don't remember the actual name)
3. Kopi Tiramisu - The best tiramisu I've had.

What you should skip:
1. Chicken Curry Puffs - This was just meh, but the pastry outside was yummy.
2. Mama's Chicken Curry - Also meh
3. Dimsums - I did not try it, but I've heard it's skippable as the portions are not justified with the price (only 3, weird serving amount) and are just okay. ",2,1749575241.0,IndianFoodPhotos,1,1.0,False

Growing up in the grand old city of New York, Farmer Ted (well, at the time, just Ted) didn't know the damnest thing about farmin'. He didn't know how to plow, how to spread his seed, or how to sustain animal life. But if there's one thing Farmer Ted did know, it was that he had a dream.

Living in the cramped conditions of his Harlem apartment, Farmer Ted knew that there was more to life than the hustle and bustle of the big city. The crowded roads, the smoggy, polluted air, the drunk and disorderlies. He yearned for the wide open field of his ancestors and the chance to work off the land, to make a name for himself.

So one day, it was really a day like any other, Farmer Ted woke up, removed his night clothing and applied his underwear onto his emaciated frame. He then put on one sock, and then the other sock. Then he put his pants on one leg at a time, threw on his flannel shirt, and left his apartment. But when he got outside, he was hit with an overwhelming sense of malaise and existential dread. What was he doing in his life? Why was he in such pain? Why was this all that life had to offer? Well, Farmer Ted had just about had enough of that and decided the time was right.

He packed his bags, cancelled his lease, scraped together every last dime he had, and moved to the small farming town of New Paltz, New York. With his meagre savings, he was able to afford a small ~~bushel~~ parcel of land, 3 hens and 4 cocks and enough feed to sustain his flock until next Spring.

Now, Farmer Ted, as mentioned, didn't know a hell of a lot about farming. But he worked hard, cared for his animals well, and tended the fields. By the next year, he was able to work his way up to a larger parcel of land. To his surprise, when Ted was looking for an egg to eat, he found minor eggshell crumbs leading to a small corner, and in it, a newly hatched baby chick.

Farmer Ted was the first thing that Chick ever laid eyes upon, and Ted, having remembered how baby goslings imprint on the first thing they see, imagined the same was true of chickens. So he took the chick and named it Molly.

Ted treated Molly less like a farm animal and more like a pet. They were inseparable. Molly followed Ted around the farm, and with time, she grew. Ted ensured Molly got the best food, the freshest water, and even let her sleep in his house.

However, two years later, Molly fell ill. The symptoms were dire. She was vomiting up food, shivering and weak in the legs. The situation left Farmer Ted with no choice: he had to return to where it all began.

Now, NYC is home to some of the greatest animal hospitals in the world, and Ted was not going to settle for anything shy of the best for Molly. He took her to a sprawling emergency vet with Harvard-educated veterinarians and leading animal psychologists.

Molly was taken into the care of the best doctors, and Ted waited, distraught, in the lobby. This caught the attention of one of the nearby animal psychologists, who sat down.

""What's wrong, my fine fellow?"" The psychologist asked.

""My chicken... she's, she's dying."" Farmer Ted replied.

""Come, walk with me."" The psychologist answered.

While the psychologist and Ted went for a walk, a miracle happened - Molly recovered - and like a jet, she went racing for the door, wings fluttering.

As it so happened, across from the hospital, Ted and the Psychologist were sitting drinking coffees, when they saw Molly dashing through traffic towards them. Thankfully, the hen was safe, but instead of returning to Farmer Ted, she went racing off into the street looking for worms.

Now, this broke Farmer Ted. He saw Molly as his pet, his friend, even as a somewhat surrogate daughter. He turned to the Psychologist and muttered:

""I don't understand, Molly she... was imprinted on me. Why would she do this?""

""Oh, chickens don't imprint. That's a common misconception."" The psychologist replied.

Farmer Ted ruminated on this for a second, and then added: ""But, it doesn't make sense. She loved me, she followed me everywhere, hell, she came darting towards us just minute ago. Why on earth would a chicken cross the road?""

""Simple,"" replied the psychologist, ""to get to the other side.""",4,1749575050.0,ShaggyDogStories,1,1.0,False

Ever feel like your brain's running on half-power? You know that foggy feeling, the struggle to focus, or maybe just a general sense that your mental gears aren't quite meshing? We've all been there. In our busy lives, it's easy to overlook the incredible engine that powers everything we do- our brain. But what if I told you there are practical, science-backed ways to give your grey matter a serious upgrade?

That's where neuro-biohacking comes in. It's not about complex experiments or futuristic tech; it's about making smart, strategic choices to optimize your brain health and cognitive function. Think of it as fine-tuning your brain's operating system so you can think clearer, focus better, and feel more mentally resilient. I've found that even small shifts can make a huge difference in my daily clarity and energy.

Ready to boost your brainpower? Let's dive into 7 powerful neuro-biohacks you can start trying today.

## 1. Optimize Your Sleep- Your Brain's Best Friend

This might sound obvious, but it's the absolute foundation of brain health. Sleep isn't just ""rest""- it's when your brain cleans house, consolidates memories, and literally recharges. Skimping on it is like trying to run a marathon on an empty tank.

* **Aim for Quality, Not Just Quantity**: It's not just about getting 7-9 hours; it's about deep, restorative sleep.
* **Create a Sleep Sanctuary**: Make your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.
* **Consistent Schedule**: Go to bed and wake up around the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's natural clock.
* **Wind-Down Routine**: Ditch screens an hour before bed. Read a book, listen to calming music, or take a warm bath. You'd be surprised how much this helps.

## 2. Fuel Your Brain with Strategic Nutrition

Your brain is incredibly hungry, consuming about 20% of your body's energy, even though it's only 2% of your weight. What you feed it matters- a lot.

* **Embrace Healthy Fats**: Think **Omega-3 fatty acids** found in wild-caught salmon, chia seeds, and walnuts. They're crucial for brain structure and function.
* **Antioxidant-Rich Foods**: Berries, dark leafy greens, and dark chocolate help protect your brain from oxidative stress.
* **Limit Processed Foods & Sugar**: These can lead to inflammation and energy crashes, which definitely don't help your focus. In my experience, cutting back on sugar made a noticeable difference in my mental clarity and mood.

## 3. Practice Mindfulness and Meditation

This isn't just for monks or gurus. Even 5-10 minutes a day can reshape your brain. Meditation helps reduce stress, improve focus, and can even increase grey matter in areas associated with learning and memory. What's fascinating is how much it helps calm the mental chatter.

* **Start Small**: Use a guided meditation app. There are tons of free ones out there.
* **Consistency is Key**: Treat it like a daily mental workout. It gets easier, I promise!
* **Focus on Your Breath**: When your mind wanders- and it will- gently bring your attention back to your breath.

## 4. Move Your Body- Exercise for Your Brain

We often think of exercise as a physical thing, but it's one of the most powerful neuro-biohacks available. Physical activity increases blood flow to the brain, delivering vital oxygen and nutrients. It also stimulates the production of BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), which is like fertilizer for your brain cells.

* **Aerobic Exercise**: Anything that gets your heart rate up- brisk walking, jogging, dancing- is fantastic for cognitive function.
* **Mix it Up**: Don't just stick to one thing. Try different activities to challenge your coordination and different brain areas.
* **Consistency**: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.

## 5. Nurture Your Gut-Brain Connection

Did you know your gut is often called your ""second brain""? There's a superhighway of communication between your gut and your brain, influencing everything from mood to cognitive function. An unhealthy gut can lead to brain fog and even anxiety.

* **Probiotics**: Incorporate fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, or kimchi into your diet. These introduce beneficial bacteria.
* **Prebiotics**: Feed those good bacteria with foods rich in fiber, like oats, bananas, and onions.
* **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water! It's vital for overall health, including your gut.

## 6. Embrace Lifelong Learning and Cognitive Challenges

Your brain thrives on novelty and challenge. Just like a muscle, if you don't use it, you lose it. Learning new skills literally builds new neural pathways and strengthens existing ones.

* **Learn a New Language**: Even a few minutes a day can make a difference.
* **Pick Up an Instrument**: This engages multiple brain areas at once.
* **Solve Puzzles**: Crosswords, Sudoku, or even strategic board games can keep your mind sharp.
* **Read Diverse Books**: Challenge your perspective and expand your knowledge.

## 7. Consider Smart Supplementation (With Caution!)

While a whole-food diet is paramount, certain supplements can offer targeted support for brain health. Always do your research and consult with a healthcare professional before adding new supplements, especially if you have underlying health conditions.

* **L-Theanine**: Found in green tea, it promotes relaxed alertness and focus without jitters. I sometimes take it with coffee for a smoother energy curve.
* **Lion's Mane Mushroom**: This functional mushroom is gaining popularity for its potential to support nerve growth factor (NGF), which is important for brain cell health.
* **Creatine**: Often associated with muscles, creatine can also boost brain energy, especially useful during mentally demanding tasks.

## Your Brain's Journey Starts Now

Unlocking your brain's full potential isn't about finding one magical pill; it's about adopting a holistic approach. It's the cumulative effect of these small, consistent efforts that truly makes a difference. You don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one or two of these neuro-biohacks that resonate with you and start there.

Your brain is an incredible, adaptable organ. Give it the love and support it deserves, and you'll be amazed at what it can do. Here's to a sharper, clearer, and more vibrant you!",2,1749574869.0,BiohackingLibrary,0,1.0,False

1l83za3,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfertilitySucks/comments/1l83za3/tone_deaf_pregnant_friend/,Tone deaf pregnant friend,"Hello everyone, I need some advice on how to navigate this. 

Some back story, I’ve been trying for 1.5 years and had a MC at 13 weeks in January. My best friend became pregnant in Feb. she didn’t even tell me till she was 13 weeks and everyone knew. She let me talk to her about “wait till you smell coffee, it’s horrible” etc. she knows I’m struggling and went through a crazy MC but I’m a bit annoyed she didn’t tell me when she told everyone else. We talked and I tried to support her. Her first ultrasound was the next day so I said “send me your sonogram pic!”. She proceeded to send me multiple videos throughout the week of the sonogram, a heartbeat (this one triggers me) and all sorts of others. 

I realize everytime I try to talk to her she does something that seems tone deaf. I fade away for a bit, then say I was busy. 

For example, she’s keeping the gender and name a surprise. I knew what names she wanted for a girl so I said hmm I wonder if I’ll be right? She says “maybe for baby #2”. And I’m like.. oh you’re already planning your next pregnancy.. and I can’t even get 1. Didn’t say that, but felt it. She’s also mentioned how it happened so quick (2 cycles) and she said we even skipped a few months cause she didn’t want to be super pregnant around a certain time. Once again, must be nice to pick and choose. 

I’ve been trying to be supportive but she seems really tone deaf with my struggles and honestly doesn’t understand. She will randomly text me “had a dream you had a negative test, then it turned positive!” Like I doubt your dream is the thing that gets me pregnant at this point. Then the cherry on top was a few days ago, she asks me if I’m “still trying”.. like yes I’m still trying? What kind of question is that? 

I’m sorry, this has been a rough ride with IVF (not a candidate) and possibly needing donor eggs, very low levels, etc. I don’t want to make her feel bad but I kind of want to ghost her. Everytime we talk I end up in a spiral of some sorts at the end of the conversation. ",1,1749574729.0,InfertilitySucks,5,0.6,False

Coffea Circulor, Moonwake Coffee, Nomad in Barcelona, Hydrangea, Sey, Archetype, Prodigal and so on. I've tried so many that have been recommended on here.

Moonwake has please me very much (All of those are fantastic) but recently I tried a roaster in Canada and was really pleased with the Ethiopian naturally processed coffee that I got from them. 

Sorellina Coffee Roasters really impressed me. I tied their Ethiopian Naturally Processed Il Giardino and it was incredible. (It was one of probably eight Ethiopian coffees that I've gotten the last couple months and it stood out easily as one of the best. And most of these coffees were incredible by the way, so the bar was set solidly high. 

I reordered from Moonwake and I reordered from Sorellina. I got the Il Giardino again and this time got a second Ethiopian Natural from them in the Kokose Lot 130. I have very high hopes for that one now, especially having tasted the other. (The best beans in the world don't mean nothing if they are not roasted in a way that brings out the greatness.

1l83ww3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l83ww3/refusing_to_let_men_pick_me_up_or_pay_for_dates/,Refusing to let men pick me up or pay for dates in the beginning.,"Hey guys. For some background, I am fairly low income and live in a very expensive area, and because I live on my own I'm scraping by and often can't afford to go out to dinner or anything like that. Unless an even small expense is budgeted for in advance, I usually only have a few dollars to my name. I also do not own a car and walk or bus everywhere in a small city without much public transit. That will explain my perspective somewhat.

When I begin going on dates with someone they usually want to pick me up, but I will only go somewhere I can bus to or walk to since I do not want to get in a man's car until I know him better, which limits options. I also will only meet him for coffee or something cheap I can afford, since I insist on paying for myself. I insist on paying for myself because I once had a date walk out on me at a bar when he found out I had dated minorities before (we are both white.) he was a super shitty guy and good riddance, luckily we were paying for ourselves and I didn't get stuck with a tab. Ever since then I have some anxiety about being walked out on during a date and being left with the bill. Even if it's my own bill at even an affordable restaurant, unless I have budgeted for that spending, I would not be able to afford it. I have a fear of being arrested or something for not being able to pay a bill I get stuck with (not sure how restaurants etc handle that) so any dates I go on have to be planned in advance, budgeted for, and I pay for myself. I also don't think men paying for dates is fair on them, and something in me makes me feel like I am indebted to them if they do.

This kind of limits me because usually I can't afford to go out to dinner etc. and can't even do a few bucks for coffee spontaneously, normally. I'm talking to someone new right now, haven't met him in person, and today he mentioned wanting to take me out to dinner tonight, but I can't and explained my reasons why. I won't even go out to dinner in the beginning because the $20-30 or so I would have to spend on myself if a big expense for me, and I would have to make sacrifices in my budget on other things for it, and I do not want to spend that on a date with someone unless I have gotten to know them pretty well in person first. I know living this poor is very uncommon, everyone in my area on my income seems to live with family (including this guy who wants to see me) but I value my independence/have an abusive family so I rent a room. It's very awkward to explain my situation and concerns when I have to turn down a date.

Guys are usually pretty understanding, but I can tell they are usually a little offended that I do not want them to pick me up, and often want to pay for the date or even insist on it and I'm really not comfortable with that and I can tell it bothers them I won't let them pay. Like they are self conscious about it or feel emasculated or something. Even if they are good, sweet guys, all men seem to be a little bothered by it. I've had guys get self conscious and feel they have to tell the barista or wait staff I am insisting on paying for myself, like they will be judged for not paying for me 

I think I need to just save up like $40 and have it on hand to cover this kind of thing. Anyway, just thought I would post this here because it is a small source of stress for me, and wondering if anyone has any advice or input. Even if I set aside some money and can do things more spontaneously, I still would have the struggle of a man not being happy I don't want him to pick me up or pay for a date.",3,1749574570.0,Advice,7,1.0,False

Only precisely prepared purées “for pleasure” and we switched to a feeding tube for nutrition and hydration. 

He still asks for coffee, water and to try interesting drinks he sees others having. He doesn’t like the “sponge pops” they recommended at the hospital. He chokes and has a subsequent panic attack almost daily when he gets these liquids. 

My siblings are of the mindset that we should do what he asks for because it’s his life and always relent. I push back. Sometimes he insists and then I relent. Sometimes he accepts that I’m not up for a choking event today and goes without the drink. I feel calm and relieved when this happens and panicked when he does take a drink and 3/5 times chokes on it and goes into a panic attack after clearing his throat. 

I am at peace with letting my siblings have a different risk tolerance but is it wrong that I won’t provide him what he wants unless he really really pushes for it? I feel the same about most foods. It seems like my family are always “trying something new” and I’m only comfortable giving him the tried and true snacks we know he can tolerate and nothing more - even if he feels left out at a family dinner.

Growing up in the grand old city of New York, Farmer Ted (well, at the time, just Ted) didn't know the damnest thing about farmin'. He didn't know how to plow, how to spread his seed, or how to sustain animal life. But if there's one thing Farmer Ted did know, it was that he had a dream.

Living in the cramped conditions of his Harlem apartment, Farmer Ted knew that there was more to life than the hustle and bustle of the big city. The crowded roads, the smoggy, polluted air, the drunk and disorderlies. He yearned for the wide open field of his ancestors and the chance to work off the land, to make a name for himself.

So one day, it was really a day like any other, Farmer Ted woke up, removed his night clothing and applied his underwear onto his emaciated frame. He then put on one sock, and then the other sock. Then he put his pants on one leg at a time, threw on his flannel shirt, and left his apartment. But when he got outside, he was hit with an overwhelming sense of malaise and existential dread. What was he doing in his life? Why was he in such pain? Why was this all that life had to offer? Well, Farmer Ted had just about had enough of that and decided the time was right.

He packed his bags, cancelled his lease, scraped together every last dime he had, and moved to the small farming town of New Paltz, New York. With his meagre savings, he was able to afford a small --bushel-- parcel of land, 3 hens and 4 cocks and enough feed to sustain his flock until next Spring.

Now, Farmer Ted, as mentioned, didn't know a hell of a lot about farming. But he worked hard, cared for his animals well, and tended the fields. By the next year, he was able to work his way up to a larger parcel of land. To his surprise, when Ted was looking for an egg to eat, he found minor eggshell crumbs leading to a small corner, and in it, a newly hatched baby chick.

Farmer Ted was the first thing that Chick ever laid eyes upon, and Ted, having remembered how baby goslings imprint on the first thing they see, imagined the same was true of chickens. So he took the chick and named it Molly.

Ted treated Molly less like a farm animal and more like a pet. They were inseparable. Molly followed Ted around the farm, and with time, she grew. Ted ensured Molly got the best food, the freshest water, and even let her sleep in his house.

However, two years later, Molly fell ill. The symptoms were dire. She was vomiting up food, shivering and weak in the legs. The situation left Farmer Ted with no choice: he had to return to where it all began.

Now, NYC is home to some of the greatest animal hospitals in the world, and Ted was not going to settle for anything shy of the best for Molly. He took her to a sprawling emergency vet with Harvard-educated veterinarians and leading animal psychologists.

Molly was taken into the care of the best doctors, and Ted waited, distraught, in the lobby. This caught the attention of one of the nearby animal psychologists, who sat down.

""What's wrong, my fine fellow?"" The psychologist asked.

""My chicken... she's, she's dying."" Farmer Ted replied.

""Come, walk with me."" The psychologist answered.

While the psychologist and Ted went for a walk, a miracle happened - Molly recovered - and like a jet, she went racing for the door, wings fluttering.

As it so happened, across from the hospital, Ted and the Psychologist were sitting drinking coffees, when they saw Molly dashing through traffic towards them. Thankfully, the hen was safe, but instead of returning to Farmer Ted, she went racing off into the street looking for worms.

Now, this broke Farmer Ted. He saw Molly as his pet, his friend, even as a somewhat surrogate daughter. He turned to the Psychologist and muttered:

""I don't understand, Molly she... was imprinted on me. Why would she do this?""

""Oh, chickens don't imprint. That's a common misconception."" The psychologist replied.

Farmer Ted ruminated on this for a second, and then added: ""But, it doesn't make sense. She loved me, she followed me everywhere, hell, she came darting towards us just minute ago. Why on earth would a chicken cross the road?""

""Simple,"" replied the psychologist, ""to get to the other side.""",5,1749574395.0,Jokes,5,0.59,False

There was a time when I didn’t realise this. Whenever I felt sad, angry, or low, I used to blame people or situations for how I was feeling. Whether they were technically responsible or not - that wasn’t the point. What mattered was that I was mentally disturbed, emotionally drained, and even physically affected. I’d get headaches, experience fear, and lose sleep over constant overthinking. I’d wake up late, feeling tired and heavy. At that time, I simply didn’t have the maturity to see that even if someone else caused my state, I was the one carrying it.

Out of a deep interest in self-help and inner peace, I turned to meditation - starting with Isha Kriya on you tube . That simple practice gave me an unexpected joy for no reason. It drew me in. I started exploring more and eventually did several programs with the Isha Foundation.

Now, after 4–6 years of following Sadhguru and doing these practices, I can genuinely say that many things have simply vanished from my system - like they dissolved in thin air.
One of the biggest shifts has been anger. I used to carry a lot of it - now I might experience it just 10–20 days a year, and even then, it's mild and manageable. Headaches, once frequent, are almost non-existent unless I’m in an extremely noisy environment. Addictions like coffee or tea have dropped on their own. I’ve become much more sensitive to what fuels my energy and what doesn’t. And those emotional crashes over silly things? They're not totally gone, but probably reduced to significant portion

Meditation and yogic practices have given me freedom - not just calm. Freedom to see clearly, to not be ruled by every thought or emotion, and to move through life with more awareness and less friction. So many compulsions I didn’t even realise I had are no longer there.

This journey has made me realise - true change isn’t loud. It’s subtle, deep, and often invisible… until one day, you look back and realise how far you’ve come.

Cause i “dont” use instagram that much he sent facebook request and i took it. He told lets go to coffee date but he didn’t say when so i didn’t take it seriously. You know if you are planning date you should text the person the planned day and let them know. He didn’t so i was kind of frustrated that he didn’t follow his words up.

I know i have a problem but i dont wanna ghost or block him like people are saying. Just today he told me lets go to resort to chill. Which is tricky cause we dont know each other THAT well to go that far. So i said no i dont wanna go to far place. It was 12 km away and wasn’t a nice resort.

For example his d size is small and stinks, manipulative and gaslighting, likes minors even tho he is 25 years old now, doesn’t take no for an answer, pushy etc ",1,1749574139.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False
1l83p5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/hingeapp/comments/1l83p5s/rejecting_just_before_the_second_date/,Rejecting just before the second date,"My brains been in a bit all over the show over this, so appreciate anyone knocking some sense into me.

I've (31F) matched with a guy (38m) on Hinge last month. We moved off platform pretty quickly, had a really lovely first date, and we agreed two days ago to go on our second on Thursday. 

In person he was absolutely perfect, conversation flowed really well and we had a lot of mutual interests etc, but via text I feel like I'm being interrogated, getting mixed interest signals and being forced into engaging in cringe flirt (which is not my style this early on) - he's very direct, and very determined to find out if I hit all the matches he wants in a woman (which is fair enough tbh) which some I do, others I don't, and some I'm not willing to disclose this early on - I have certain walls and my trust needs earned before I'm ready to lower those. I'm actively avoiding opening my messages right now because the notification is putting me into uncomfortable response material - which sucks because we got on so well talking face to face.

I haven't had to reject anyone in a very long time, but my gut feeling is that whilst I'd like to experience the fun we had on our first date, I don't think I'm going to get that on our second, and I am definitely not what he is going to want in a relationship.

Is it even worth going ahead with date two at this point? Or am I better just sending a ""hey sorry I know this is all very last minute, but Ive been thinking about our plans for coffee, and respectfully I'm going to have to cancel. I think you're amazing but right now I just don't see this going any further and I don't want to waste your time"" etc etc etc

And 100% would be messaging friends about this and not using a throwaway on Reddit if that was an option lol but it's been causing me wayyyy too much anxiety ",1,1749574070.0,hingeapp,2,1.0,False

1l83l1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l83l1m/sailing_takes_me_away/,Sailing takes me away,"Background:
 
I am 50M with one divorce under my belt. I don’t like to talk about that first marriage or why it ended, but, let’s just say that I’ve learned a few things about relationships, both successful and failed, in my adult life. I worked hard for most of my life and, after saving and making effective investment choices, I was able to retire about 9 years ago just before I turned 41. My retirement didn’t last long as I began to realize that sitting around, smoking weed all day, and avoiding responsibilities. 

Toward the end of my first marriage, I had taken up golf. I was good at it…a “bogey” golfer…but I really only used the activity to avoid my ex on the weekends. Once that marriage ended, I stored my Ping G2s in the basement and found other things to occupy my time. When I retired, I joined a country club and started playing again. I wasn’t as good as I had been, but the activity was more for being social. I am a Navy veteran and because of that, I left my hometown in my 20s and have moved around a lot until my retirement. Now that I had been in one place for a while, I had a few friends, and I rarely went back to my hometown.
 
It was through contacts at the club that I was convinced to start a business to keep the income flowing and to build something. When I was young, during high school, my father had managed a hardware store, and, despite clear child-labor laws at the time, I worked there from the age of twelve. I was paid cash under the table and learned how to take inventory, drive a forklift, skid steers, and large 3 speed stake trucks. Thinking back to summer days in the sun, stacking lumber and unloading trucks with fondness, I liquidated a small chunk of my portfolio and bought a retail storefront with a large gravel lot in the back. The business was once a natural gas distributor so it had good infrastructure for a hardware store. I reached out to a company with a wholesale brand and signed their franchise deal. Six months later, with two employees (two college kids whose parents were club members) I had a grand opening event with free barbecue, games for kids, a bounce house and a Jimmy Buffett tribute band (because I’m a huge Parrothead from way back).
 
The first year of operations, I took a small loss. I absorbed it because I was focused on building the business. One of my employees had left because he had transferred to another university in a different state, but I replaced him with another local guy he had recommended; we’ll call him “Dave”. Dave was closer to my age and had worked a lot of retail jobs, but never landed on one segment of the industry that he had enjoyed. He had a degree in business administration and could have gone to work in corporate management or operations, but, he insisted, he just liked retail. I couldn’t blame him, it was easy work, and, aside from the occasional poorly-behaved customer, comparatively stress-free.
 
It was through Dave that I met Julie (name changed, obviously). She was 28, with a marketing degree and fit. Not “gym rat” fit, with more defined abs than mine, but she knew how to take care of herself. She didn’t come off as particularly outgoing, or a social butterfly, but she was entirely pleasant, spoke her mind in a very measured and deliberate way, and wasn’t afraid of anything. I’ve heard it said that “no red flags” is a red flag, but it didn’t register with me. After a few coffee dates and a few “dinner and a movie” evening, we made it official. She had a job and her own life with her own friends yet somehow seemed to integrate well into my lifestyle. She had tattoos and piercings, some of which weren’t visible, even when she wore a bikini which I found very erotic. 

She was my frequent guest at the country club and after a year, I added her to my membership. At that point, because it made sense for us to live together. She moved in and started decorating my house with some of her things to make it more “our home” instead of mine where she was just living. She contributed half of the utility and grocery, but, because the house was paid for, I never charged her anything for rent. When her beat up Ford Focus finally breathed its last breath, I bought another car for her to use and added it to my insurance. I met her family, not just her parents and siblings, but the entire extended family. They were well-to-do, but not grotesquely wealth, and appreciated my financial independence. Her father, head of the trust department at a local financial firm, was impressed that I had chosen to spend my retirement in a “second-act” owning a business and building something.
 
After a year of dating and two more of living together, I proposed. I booked a long weekend at a cabin in the Blue Ridge mountains and bought a 1.5 carat diamond ring with garnets and sapphires (our birthstones). We arrived late on a Friday night in February and there was snow on the ground. We unpacked from the trip and spent the evening decompressing in front of the fireplace with wine, watching a movie. The next evening I had planned the proposal dinner at a restaurant in the nearby town. After the meal and the server brought the dessert menu, I got one one knee, presented the ring and asked her. She immediately said “yes” and…well…everyone clapped. No shit; everyone in the restaurant clapped.
 
After the proposal trip, we went into full wedding-planning mode: venues, caterer, band, photographer, dresses, tuxes, etc. She was the only daughter among her parents four children and I felt the pressure of making sure it would be a memorable event, not just for us, but for her family as well. I wasn’t trying to impress anyone or cater to anyone else, I just wanted to make sure that it was special for her. “I’ve found the one” I thought. After a failed marriage and countless, less-than-stellar relationships since, I had “the one”.
 
Or so I thought.
 
I had added Julie onto my phone plan shortly after she moved in. We both had iphones and backed them up to a shared account and shared google docs for the wedding planning. One day, about a month before the wedding, I was logged in, looking at the spreadsheet and scanning hard copy paperwork for the photographer into the drive when I accidentally scanned the invoice as a JPEG instead of PDF. Because it automatically saved it to the pictures folder, I opened that folder to delete it and save it to the wedding folder.
 
And that’s when I saw them. The tattoos on her back were the identifying information, but the clue was the arch of her back and the way she was gripping the sheets told me that this was an intimate photo, but I didn’t remember taking it. I quickly checked the time/date stamp and checked my phone, but it wasn’t on it and I thought to myself that I had probably deleted it like I had most of the others. It’s way too easy for someone to hack into accounts these days and steal phones. I thought that maybe we had used Julie’s phone for the photo and made a mental note to ask her to delete it. I don’t know what made me do it, but I checked the meta data on the phone and there it was. The photo hadn’t backed up from an iPhone, but a Pixel and I felt all of the blood drain from my face. I immediately felt nauseated and light-headed. My heart raced and wanted to jump out of my chest. I managed to calm myself down and convinced myself that it was a mistake. I chalked it up to Google being wrong because there was no reason for Julie to behave that way. She was smart, level-headed and very responsible and it was most likely a picture I had taken during our intimate moments and forgotten about. After all, weed and tequila are not known for enhancing memory and we had a habit of getting “crazy” when we, well, you know…
 
I tried to let it go, and I went about my life as if I hadn’t seen it, but the thoughts lingered. I didn’t do bachelor parties, but a week before the wedding I had a few guys from the club over for bourbon and poker and Julie went out to dinner with her friends. She actually came home around midnight, early, because the guys were still there. She seemed a little upset, but brushed it off; told me that one of her friends was kind of a downer talking about how hard marriage is and kind of killed the vibe. We went to bed and woke up the next morning refreshed and ready to tackle all of the things we had to do in the last week. Final fittings for dresses and tuxes, getting the wine to the rehearsal dinner venue and picking up the wedding rings.
 
After running a few wedding-related errands in town, I stopped by the store to check on things. I wasn’t planning on being in much during that week and one of my employees (now up to six) told me that someone had stopped in early to speak with me. She hadn’t left a name or number, just a promise that she would be back later. I texted Julie, told her that something was up at the store, and that I would be awhile getting back. “No problem” she replied and I went back to my office to fiddle with paperwork and wait for the woman to return. About half-an-hour later, Gabbie, one of Julie’s bridesmaids walked in.
 
“I need to show you something.” She announced, pulling out her phone.
 
I looked at the screen and saw the chat history; Julie and Gabbie talking about Julie’s affair, about how, once we were married, she’d be entitled to half and she’d just have to stick it out long enough to get a decent settlement, maintenance, and, if there were kids involved, a hefty chunk in child support too. I scrolled, stunned at how far back the thread went; nearly two years.
 
“She thinks she already may be pregnant.” Gabbie said under her breath.
 
I was floored. It wasn’t just the infidelity, though that was bad enough, nor was it the gold-digging, though also pretty bad. It was the pre-meditation. I can’t even begin to describe how much pain I was in. I was shocked, appalled, angry, and depressed. Mostly, I was just sad.
 
“She doesn’t know I’m here. She doesn’t know I’m telling you this. You’re such a good guy. Honestly, I thought she had always been mostly joking about her plans, just girl talk. You know?”
 
“Just. Girl. Talk.” I growled through clenched teeth.
 
“What are you going to do?” Gabbie asked.
 
“I don’t know.” I replied.
 
“Don’t do anything rash.”
 
“I never do.”
 
I smiled through the next five days, putting on a good show for the crowds who were slowly trickling into town for the wedding. I had a few friends from college and the Navy who RSVP’d but most of the guests were Julie’s friends and family. I set up everything for the night of the rehearsal dinner. I wasn’t going to embarrass her publicly, but she needed to know that I knew what was going on.
 
The wedding party gathered at the church. It was a 200+ year old baroque style Catholic basilica with great acoustics and gold leaf everywhere. As far as churches go, it was pretty impressive. I walked into the bride’s chamber to have the conversation with her before the rehearsal started. I asked everyone if we could have privacy, and everyone left but her mother. “You shouldn’t be alone with the bride this close to the wedding.” She claimed, as if adhering to some made-up archaic rule that dictated how this was going to go. I just nodded and pulled up the picture from the google drive on my phone.
 
Julie’s face went bright red when she saw it.
 
“Where did you get that?” She demanded.
 
“Google drive.”
 
“that’s from before we ever met; why are you bringing this up now?”
 
“Really?” I asked. “You didn’t have that sparrow tattoo when we met.”
 
The reply that she planned to stammer out caught in her throat.
 
“It was a mistake.” She claimed. “I’m sorry. We can talk about this.”

“That may have been a mistake”, I said, “but Gabbie told me everything about your ‘plan’.”
 
“What plan?” Julie sighed, waving me off.
 
“Your plan to ‘hang in there for a couple of years’ so you can get a decent maintenance settlement and maybe some child support.” Her mother was somewhat uncomfortable, but not shocked. Based on her reaction, or lack thereof, I deduced that she was the source of this “plan” or at least that she knew about it.
 
“That was just girl talk; we were joking…”
 
“For two years?” I interrupted.
 
“Please, can we talk about this?”
 
“We’re talking now. Make it quick. I’ve got somewhere better to be.” I stood up, buttoned the bottom button on my jacket and waited for her explanation.
 
“Let’s just get through this dinner and we can talk.”
 
“There’s not going to be a dinner. No rehearsal. No wedding.”
 
Her mother let out a half-gasp, half-moan.
 
“I’m pregnant.” Julie announced.
 
“Then I suggest you tell the father. I had a vasectomy thirteen years ago.” And with that, I walked out.
 
I left the church through a side door, got in my car and drove to a park. There I composed an email on my phone thanking everyone for coming and that the wedding was cancelled. I cancelled all of the arrangements. It was the night before the event, so I lost all of the deposits; all told, $28,000 in straight wedding expenses gone. The worst was cancelling the honeymoon. Another $12,000 that I’d never get back. I didn’t know what to do after that or where to go, so I just drove home. My phone started blowing up almost immediately. I turned it off. I packed a bag and called a ride share to take me to a hotel on the other side of town. I checked in and turned my phone back on to make a quick call to my lawyer. Our lives were entangled. I couldn’t just change the locks on the house. Because she had established residency, I couldn’t just change the locks. He told me he would work on things over the weekend and get back to me on Monday.
 
I lay in the hotel bed and didn’t sleep. I tossed and turned all night and just stared at the ceiling and walls when that didn’t help. No red flags: the biggest red flag of them all. I got up the next morning and had some coffee from the shitty machine in the room and checked my phone for the fallout. The name calling was expected and not very creative. I was an asshole, a douchebag, heartless, coward, no class, etc. I didn’t reply to any of them.
 
Our finances were easy. We’d had separate accounts for everything. No joint savings, no credit cards where she was the authorized user, nothing. I had kept it that way for a reason. All of my assets, house, cars, business, etc., were held in an irrevocable trust. I had protected myself a long time ago, only a few months into my retirement. Everything was judgment proof. I, myself, owned no real assets; the trust did. Still, I had her removed from the phone plan, and buttoned up everything else as tight as I could. My Navy buddy, Scott, had come in for the wedding. He was also retired and single; drove around the country in a converted camper-van, travelling to state and national parks and posting youtube videos about his experiences. I asked him for help and he replied: “Anything I can do.”
 
I had my lawyer draw up a residency agreement for the house. He would stay in the house and occupy it during the fallout. I wanted to make sure that Julie didn’t go crazy and burn the place down while the rest of her world went up in flames around her. Turns out that was unnecessary as Julie never went back. Per Scott, her father showed up that following Monday with a truck to move out her stuff. There was a scene at the dinner venue, but I told Scott that I didn’t care, so he didn’t share. A week after the fiasco, I went back to the house and changed the locks. I did a walkthrough to make sure every trace of her was gone and, but for a few spots where the dust had been disturbed and the outlines on the walls where paint had faded around wall-hangings that were Julie’s or clearly community property, there was  no sign that she had ever been there.
 
The next month was a blur. I got up, went to work, stayed late, and went home, more or less, just to sleep. It was depressing to simply sit in my house alone, after 4+ years of sharing it with someone. I couldn’t handle the depression of staying in that house knowing what it meant: a life cancelled.
 
Ultimately, I turned over day-to-day management of the store to my assistant manager. I sold the house, furnishings, cars, everything I could. I packed two seabags worth of clothes and donated everything that I couldn’t sell. I bought a bus-ticket for the ocean and bought a sailboat: a 44’ Pacific Seacraft which in christened “Lonely Princess”.
 
That was a year ago. I spent four months working on the boat in the yard, building a hard dodger and hard bimini top from foam and carbon fiber using YouTube videos as a guide. I pulled the diesel engine and generator out and upgraded to an electric drive system with 1200w of solar panels to drive the power requirements. I completely refit all of the wiring, plumbing and sailing electronics like the chartplotter, all of the gauges and added StarLink. I spent the winter sailing around the Caribbean and have just recently made my way back up north for hurricane season.
 
Julie had the baby, but all of the dudes she thought might have been the father wanted nothing to do with her. The marketing firm where she worked had espoused conservative values, so when they learned that the wedding was off and that she was pregnant, they terminated her contract (because she was a contract worker, not a FTE). Last I heard, she was working an entry-level office position at a warehouse and living in her brother’s garage with her child.
 
Me? I’m getting ready for the summer cruising season in the north. Martha’s Vineyard, Manhattan and then down to DC/Baltimore for Independence day before slowly making my way back south. I have some shipyard time scheduled from August to September to do some work on the boat, but life is good. I’ve given up on a quiet family and home life. I’m reminded of a line from the Bruce Chatwin book *The Songlines*: from a Caribou Eskimo to Dr. Knud Rassmussen “What can we do? We were born with the Great Unrest. Our father taught us that life is one long journey on which only the unfit are left behind.”

I feel that if you network right you won't have a bad time when finding internships. People talk about how cooked the CS market is and I can definitely see their point. They apply to hundreds of applications and get maybe 1 interview if theyre lucky. But I feel nowadays we shouldnt be cold applying but rather building connections. Thats where I think Queens has an advantage. The network you make is really valuable. Joining clubs was the best thing I couldve done because as a first year I have a part time coop at a startup.  
People keep telling me how cooked they are then I see no personal projects or club experience. If they joined clubs, Im sure they could find some connection that could help them. Maybe not in first year but in second year, they could for sure find someone. I do think I was lucky in getting this coop but I did work hard to present opportunities to myself. GPA wasnt even considered for me getting this coop. Literally I got this coop because I knew someone.  
I used to believe that getting a good GPA was the best way to secure a job. And maybe it is at UofT or UW but Queens actually has so much networking opportunities that it makes up for its lack of academic rigor (in comparison to the ""tier-1"" cs unis).  
What I also love about Queens is us CS kids can get involved with the commerce people. Im not sayign do a duel degree but you could realistically join a consulting club or a startup incubator team and make lots of connections their. Having coffee chats or parties really help. Heck Ive gotten all my club positions based on connections. People have referred me so much that even if I messed up slightly on the interview I would beat out the person who was an academic weapon just because I was more trusted and a more likable person with a personality

1l83iva,https://v.redd.it/1vpopqlpo46f1,Make time for Hebrew with me!!,"“I don’t have time” is the most honest thing anyone has ever said about learning Hebrew.

Between work, family, life… where exactly are you supposed to fit in an entire new language?

Here’s what I’ve learned after teaching Hebrew for years:
The people who actually succeed aren’t the ones with endless free time.
The people who actually succeed are the ones who choose a program that fits into their lives and schedules.

Because Hebrew is a long game.

Five minutes while your coffee brews. Ten minutes on your lunch break. Fifteen minutes before bed instead of scrolling.
When you use the right program and method for you, that’s all you need to make great progress.

And the long game is won by showing up consistently using the right method.

Sarah messaged me last week:
“I’ve been doing 10 minutes a day of Practically Speaking Hebrew, and suddenly I understood an entire conversation at the grocery store.”

That’s the thing about Hebrew:
Every small moment adds up until one day you realize you’re actually having the conversations you always wanted to have.

Your busy life isn’t the problem.
It’s actually the perfect training ground for building the kind of steady Hebrew habit that actually sticks.

The question isn’t whether you have time.
It’s whether you’re ready to use the time you already have differently:

Using a program where every minute spent learning moves you forward…
And that fits into your life and schedule.

Since I stopped seeing him a close friend who was struggling reached out to me to see this same psychiatrist. I gave her their name and she was able to get an appointment with the psych. Unfortunately my friend was really struggling and ended up dying before their first appointment. She had waited over 2 months to get in with him. 

My psychiatrist never said I could reach out after we stopped seeing each other. But they did say I could have my doctors reach out to him.

Whether they were actually responsible or not wasn’t the point - inside, it would shake me. I used to get headaches sometimes, even a fever if I was too sad or angry. Also, I couldn't sleep due to overthinking and used to wake up late with no energy. I was not mature enough to see that even if technically the other person had caused that situation, anyways it's still affecting me.

I was deeply into self-help books, which eventually led me to meditation. I began with Isha Kriya on YouTube - and I still remember the sheer joy I felt for no reason. That experience pulled me deeper. I did more Isha Foundation programs and slowly, without even realising when, something shifted. Looking back after 4–6 years of following my Guru, Sadhguru, & his practices I see so many patterns have just dissolved. One major change is anger. Earlier, it ruled me. Now, I might feel angry 10–20 days in a year and even then, it's mild. Headaches? Haven’t had one in 4 years unless I’m in a super noisy place. Addictions like tea or coffee have reduced. I’ve become more conscious of what nourishes me, what drains me. I still get affected by silly things sometimes, but even that has reduced to quite big level.

I love how meditation gives us freedom to see that every moment we have choice to respond rather than react compulsively to our patterns and also pure ancient form of Yoga gives us freedom from many compulsions which we may not even be aware of.

In May, we added a friend to the lease (knew her in the military, she got out for an injury). She was worried about her cousin kicking her out (should have been my first red flag), and wanted a place downtown that was close to work - so I offered her my office and she was added to the lease soon after.

She's 6 years my junior (I'm 25) and she's extremely immature and has been overstepping boundaries. I had a sit down with her where I outlined a few house rules a few weeks after she moved in. It was mainly addressing ongoing issues my fiance and I had with her: Using my cosmetics and toiletries without permission, borrowing my expensive clothes (and stretching them), leaving full drinks places and letting them go bad, not cleaning after herself after cooking.

She agreed to the terms and cleaned up her act a bit, but now she's straight back to her bad habits. My fiance just found the ""rules"" list I made in the trash. It doesn't even have anything crazy there, it's just basic courtesy stuff that she didn't have the common sense to follow.

I woke up this morning to get ready for work and stepped in a huge puddle of sticky coffee. She left a full grande Starbucks drink on the table last night (that I reminded her about before going to bed). She didn't dump it out, and my cats knocked it over in the night. It's all over the table, floor, chairs, and ruined the tablecloth.

My fiance let her know this morning after I left and she got mad that WE didn't clean it up. And then stormed off back to bed and slammed the door. She left the mess there.

She's also called him names in the past, and throws things at us when we upset her.

We'll have one more talk with her, but if it happens one more time and she keeps disrespecting us in our home, we're talking with management about taking her off the lease and sending her packing. It's like living with a spoiled child, and I can't handle it anymore. I'm not her mother. She's also been talking down to me recently because I don't drive (never got taught, but I don't need to anyway), and she does and just got a new car. I was kind enough to invite her in, and then she acts like this??

Edit: spelling

ETA: I've met her dad, and he's said outright that I'm her only friend that he likes. I might talk to him about what she's been doing as well. She was lying to him before about not texting while driving and he appreciated me telling him the truth.

Last edit: She also doesn't pay us back for things. She complains about how she's so broke, but always buys new junk she doesn't need. She let slip to my fiance that she has $700 in savings. But God forbid she pays us back, she's so broke!",18,1749573151.0,badroommates,19,0.89,False

We have a stray cat that’s been hanging around for around 3-4 years. She had a batch of kittens about 6-8 weeks ago. We named them, and we had one we even wanted to keep.

This morning, as I was making my coffee I heard something squealing outside. I ran out there, and saw my dog had the kitten we wanted to take in, in his mouth. I got him to drop it after a minute and it stood its ground hissing at him. I scooted it under the deck with my foot because I didn’t want my dog to go after it again, and I didn’t want to get scratched. I put my dog up and came back for it. It was under our deck, completely in shock.

We got it out, wrapped it up in a blanket and put some sugar water on its gums every few minutes. It would come in and out of consciousness.  Start crying and acting like it was going to get up, and then go back into a trance. We called several animal hospitals. 1 said they would take it, but not for another hour. I laid next to it on our deck, started talking to it and petting it and then watched it stop breathing. Its mouth turned completely white. And it passed away. 

We let mama and siblings see it before we buried it.

Now I can’t stop crying. I can’t stop replaying it. The whole thing was just so traumatic. I feel so sad. I don’t blame my dog, but it hurts to see him right now. I feel like I’m overreacting but I have the most emotional personality. ",7,1749573130.0,cats,4,0.9,False

I had to consider myself lucky that my sorority sister had an uncle that used to work at this firm and could get me in. Internships were hard to come by these days and this firm had especially high demand. That sister owed me a favor, though, since I spent so many weekend nights this last year taking care of her drunk ass.

But the partners and associates were really demanding, expecting to not have to think about a single thing unrelated to their cases. Supplies had to be stocked, lunches orders, coffee delivered, on and on and on. I figured this was the cost of getting a foot in the door even though I wasn't getting much exposure to any casework. Once in a while I'd be making copies and read a few lines of a brief or abstract.

Maybe today was going to be my big break. One of the partners informed me that I was going to sit in on a meeting with a potential client and that I should ""dress sharp.""

I thought I always dressed sharp. Today I was wearing a white button down blouse tucked into a black skirt, black stockings, and heels. A classic, office appropriate outfit which didn't hide my curves (only the baggiest clothes could do that) but didn't over-accentuate them either. My blonde hair was knotted in a tight bun at the top of my head.

I got to the conference room five minutes early and soon some people from the firm started coming in.

""No water jug?"" one associate said. ""Wow.""

I quickly got up and went to another conference room where a tray with glasses and an empty water jug was sitting. I took it and went to the kitchen, filling the jug with cold water from the filter.

By the time I was back, most people were seated including a partner. I put the tray down on a cabinet near the back of the room. By the time I turned around more people were coming into the room including a tall man who immediately drew my eyes.

A partner stood and clapped his hands.

""Looks like everyone is here, please be seated.""

A bit of a long shot here, but I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me identify an NPB player I met a couple of years ago.

Back in 2022,I was visiting Japan with my fiancée and we stopped by a small coffee shop in Yamaguchi. While we were there, a guy came in with his girlfriend and ended up helping us with directions. He was super friendly and really went out of his way to help, which left a big impression on both of us. 

I remember him saying (or maybe it came up in conversation?) that he played in the NPB and that he was a catcher. What really stuck with me was that he looked quite a bit like Rōki Sasaki—same kind of sharp features and tall build but a little more bulky. I’m 6 feet tall and he was about my height, maybe a little taller. He seemed around my age, so probably 26–27 at the time (which would make him around 28–29 now).

Seriously, i need your input. How do you shut down your instinct? How can i help her by not helping her when every fiber in me screams i need to hug her? My therapist doesn't have an answer because i understand what i need to (not) do but i simply fail. I'm currently building my own life away from her but it's the simple, daily tricky little issues that make me fuck up. Every. Single. Day.

Like: she says she's tired, i immediately offer to make her a coffee and take whatever chore she's doing of her hand and cook dinner (yes...i'm that level of an idiot...).

If you have tips, please comment! Please help me keep the absolute love of my life in my life.",1,1749572689.0,relationship_advice,11,1.0,False

1l8326j,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1l8326j/ash_and_chrome_part_3_finale/,ASH AND CHROME (part 3 FINALE),"The twin moons hung low over the horizon, painting the Glimmerfields in hues of violet and bone-white as Kye crested the final ridge before Meridian Reach.

He was half-dead.

His ribs ached with every breath, his scarf was soaked in dried blood, and his right arm—seared from a ricocheted plasma round—hung useless at his side. He’d lost the satchel’s outer casing during a firefight with the Chrome Men two hours ago. Now the vial sat in a padded pouch strapped to his chest, glowing faintly through his torn shirt like a star that refused to die.

Below him, the domed settlement gleamed behind its shield fence—towering silver arches framed by decaying desert. Drones floated lazily in the air above, scanning for any threats. Behind those walls: over 40,000 lives choking on disease, praying for salvation.

He took one final step forward—

And the sky exploded.

A rail-round tore past his head and vaporized a rock to his right. Kye dove, hitting the dust hard. A silhouette emerged from the ridge behind—power armor, matte-black, Council-issue. Not raider scum. This was sanctioned.

Another round loaded into the chamber with a magnetic whirrr.

Then a voice rang out—clear, modulated, and cold.

“Courier Kye. Halt and surrender. The Council has declared your mission compromised. The serum is a bioweapon. You are to be terminated.”

Kye laughed, coughing blood.

He dragged himself behind a shattered dune crawler, heart pounding. His thoughts raced.

They weren’t trying to stop the disease.

They wanted to control it.

The serum wasn't a cure—it was a leash. Deployable immunity. Whoever held it could choose who lived and who died. Meridian Reach had likely refused to play along—and now the Council would rather see them burn than lose control.

He checked his gear.

One charge left.

No rifle.

Just grit, broken bones, and a soul caught between two species.

And maybe that was enough.

He took a deep breath and activated the implant in his neck.

Time slowed.

The alien half of him surged—biological time-stretching, pumping synthadrenaline through every cell. Colors became sharp. The wind slowed to a crawl. He lunged from cover, sprinting straight at the armored enforcer.

Rounds shattered stone all around him.

He hurled the charge.

It detonated mid-air in a crackling burst of EMP, shorting out the suit's optics. The enforcer howled as Kye tackled him full force, driving his shoulder into the solar plexus. They tumbled across the dirt. The enforcer swung a fist the size of Kye’s head. It connected, splitting Kye’s cheek open.

He didn’t stop.

Kye tore at the chestplate, jammed his knife between seams, and screamed as he drove it in, again and again, until the power armor finally hissed and fell silent.

Kye collapsed next to the body, panting, coughing, laughing.

He stood.

One mile left.

Every step was agony. But the walls of Meridian Reach were close now. Close enough for auto-turrets to track him.

He raised both hands, vial glowing against his chest.

The turrets locked.

He kept walking.

“IDENTIFY YOURSELF,” boomed a loudspeaker. “DROP YOUR WEAPON.”

“I have no weapon!” Kye screamed. “But I have your cure!”

A pause.

Then—movement.

The gates of Meridian Reach parted like jaws.

Figures rushed out—armed, armored, and tense. But not hostile.

One woman ran faster than the others.

Mira.

Hair buzzed short, dark eyes wide. Her breath caught when she saw him—bloody, broken, but alive.

“Kye…”

He dropped to his knees, holding out the vial.

“Get it inside. Now.”

She snatched it carefully, already radioing for containment units.

As medics rushed to him, Kye slumped over. His vision blurred. Voices faded.

But he smiled.

He’d made it.


---

Two Weeks Later

The sun was rising behind the dome as Kye stood on a balcony overlooking the recovering settlement. The streets were filled again—children laughing, people working, drones sweeping clean air instead of ash.

Mira joined him, holding two mugs of coffee.

“Still tastes like mud,” he said.

“Progress,” she replied, smirking. “It used to taste like bleach.”

They sipped in silence.

“You know the Council declared you a rogue element,” she said. “They’ll come for you.”

“Let them,” Kye replied. “I’m done hiding what I am.”

She nodded.

“We isolated the serum strain. It works. Full recovery in 93% of infected. We’re synthesizing more. Enough for other settlements soon.”

Kye stared out at the dawn.

“Good.”

She looked at him. “You could stay. People here know what you did. They’d follow you.”

“I’m not a leader,” he said.

“No. But you’re a symbol now.”

He didn’t respond.

Not yet.

Because something had changed out there. The Glimmerfields were growing. Shriekers migrating. New horrors stirring in the old lands. Rumors of a new voice echoing in the wastelands. Something older than the Council. Older than even the Terraformers.

Something calling to the part of him that wasn’t human.

He took a final sip and set the cup down.

“I need to move on.”

“Where?” Mira asked.

“West. Past the buried coast. There's an old beacon out there, still transmitting on alien bands. I think it's been waiting for me.”

Mira’s brow furrowed. “You're chasing ghosts.”

“No,” he said. “I’m chasing truth.”

He turned to leave, but paused.

“If I don’t make it back…”

“You will.”

He smirked. “Then save me some of that mud coffee.”

She nodded.

And watched as the courier—half-man, half-alien—walked once more into the Wastes.

Not as a fugitive.

Not as a weapon.

But as a legend. ",1,1749572563.0,stories,0,1.0,False

It's a long story but I was able to raise my BP, which is normally about 90/60, to about 110/70 and a lot of my pre-syncope on standing improved. Unfortunately it was from being given Aimovig, for migraines, and that med actually tripled my migraines. I failed out of Midodrine and haven't been able to try anything else for low BP yet because my doctor has been unreachable (paternity leave, in addition to some other things). 

Well the Aimovig finally wore off, and my orthostatic intolerance got so bad I finally fainted for the first time, very briefly. After that I was doing really bad and basically bed bound. Even leaving the bed to use the bathroom caused hideous pre-syncope every single time. My husband was asking me if I was getting all my sodium and fluids and I said no, because when I'm bedbound it's even harder to get liquids in. I pretty much have to sit up in bed, chug something, then lie back down. 

We discussed it and decided I would try absolutely pounding sodium and fluids for like a week and see if the pre-syncope improved and see if I could get out of the bed. I looked up the cleveland clinic recommendation, 3000-10,000mg of sodium and like 87 ounces of fluids per day. That's when I realized, holy crap! I have been drinking 2-3 gatorades, a few cups of coffee, AND about 30-40oz of water per day, with probably 2000-3000mg of added sodium. 

So we came up with a plan. We figured out that I could stop all the extra water, and if I had 4 trioral packets in gatorade + 6 extra strength Vitassium capsules per day I would hit about 9000mg added sodium, and then what's in the gatorade and in my food. I started this yesterday and I feel... amazing. I groomed my dogs. I cleaned. I did a ton of stuff that's been piling up while I've been bedbound. And I had no pre-syncope all morning. My pulse is still stupid, but I FEEL better. 

After this week I'll probably start backing off the sodium until it's at a more manageable level. Plus, it's super expensive obviously. And my doctor is finally back in office so I can look into something other than Midodrine... but just a PSA. Tons and tons and tons and TONS of fluids is not necessarily better.

### Devotional Title: Justice and Generosity: Cultivating Fair Trade in Our Community

**Scripture Reference:**

“Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.” — Psalm 82:3 (NIV)

#### Reflection:

In a world that often prioritizes profit over people, the call to justice and generosity resonates louder than ever. Fair trade is more than a marketing label; it’s a commitment to ensuring that the fruits of our labor benefit all, especially those in marginalized communities. As followers of His Word, we are encouraged to be advocates for equity and stewards of generosity in our daily lives.

Justice is deeply rooted in the character of God. He commands us to care for the weak and the oppressed, demonstrating that our actions should reflect His love and equity. Each product we purchase and each company we support can make a significant difference in the lives of others. By choosing fair trade, we align ourselves with a movement that seeks to uplift farmers, artisans, and workers in developing nations.

#### Educating Ourselves:

To cultivate justice and generosity in our community, we must begin with education. Here are some steps to broaden our understanding of fair trade:

1. **Learn about Fair Trade Principles**: Familiarize yourself with the core principles of fair trade: fair wages, ethical working conditions, and community development.
2. **Support Local Initiatives**: Research organizations and businesses in your area that prioritize fair trade. They often play a crucial role in empowering communities and promoting sustainable practices.
3. **Engage in Conversations**: Share what you’ve learned with friends and family. Encourage discussions about ethical consumption and how it impacts global communities.

#### Practical Applications:

1. **Conscious Purchasing**: Make a commitment to buy fair trade products whenever possible. Quality coffee, chocolate, and clothing often come with fair trade certifications that ensure ethical sourcing.
2. **Volunteer and Collaborate**: Partner with local NGOs that focus on fair trade initiatives or social justice. Offer your time and skills to help raise awareness or support local artisans.
3. **Practice Generosity**: Beyond financial support, consider offering your time and talents. Mentor young entrepreneurs in your community or help create platforms for local artisans to showcase their products.

#### Prayer:

Heavenly Father, thank you for your unwavering commitment to justice and compassion. Open our hearts to understand the importance of fair trade within our community. Help us to act wisely in our purchasing decisions and support those who are often overlooked. May our actions reflect your love and bring hope to the oppressed. Empower us to be advocates for justice and generous stewards of what You have provided. Amen.

#### Encouragement:

Remember that even small actions can lead to significant change. As you commit to fair trade, you become part of a larger movement—one that champions dignity, hope, and justice for all. Let your generosity flow, knowing that, in doing so, you reflect the heart of Christ to a world in need. Together, we can cultivate a community rooted in fairness and compassion.

We’re attending a wedding and have some pretty firmed up plans, however I was hoping to get some tips and insight on what to expect/how to best conduct myself, given I don’t have much exposure to Sri Lankan culture. 

1) Taxis/transport - we’ll be staying mostly in Bentota and Ahangama. My parents are not very mobile and we’ll be relying heavily on taxis / e-hailing. Is that widely available out of Colombo, and if not, what are some alternatives? I understand tuk-tuks are an option, is there an app for that/how would I arrange for one to pick me up from a specific location?

2) Tipping culture - what is the tipping culture/norm in Sri Lanka? I’m coming from a country where tipping is not a thing, however have visited cities like New York where tips are expected for pretty much anything. What’s the norm in SL?

3) Decorum - are there any major don’ts in visiting SL/the towns I’ve listed above in particular? Anything in particular to be mindful of in conducting ourselves/interacting with people? 


4) Paying for things - I gather that cash is the best option. Can card nonetheless be used in some stores and are there any scams I should be mindful of in this respect? Does Sri Lanka have a QR pay system as available in some Asian countries? 

5) recommendations/tips - please feel free to share any recommendations or tips you have for a first timer in Sri Lanka. Bentota/Ahangama specific recommendations/tips would be greatly appreciated! For contexts, I really enjoy trinkets and unique jewellery, coffee / book shops, and live music.

Thank you in advance for any insights!
