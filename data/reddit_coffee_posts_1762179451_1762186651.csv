1ong03v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ong03v,El Duderino chili - neighborhood chili cookoff,"We had our neighborhood chili cook-off yesterday.  I entered with this recipe I created for El Duderino Chili-con-carne.   I didn't place in the top 3, but I think that's because I was the only chili without beans.  If you don't have access to El Duderino from Center of the Universe brewing, you could add some extra beef stock and some Kahlúa.  

In addition to the beer, instead of the traditional large chunks of meat, I used ground beef and made smashburgers first (Those are good burgers, Walter) and added coffee (I'm finishing my coffee).

# Ingredients

* **For the Chile Paste:**
   * 4 large dried **ancho** chiles
   * 3 large dried **pasilla** chiles
   * 2 dried **chipotle morita** chile
   * 4 cups hot water (or just enough to cover the chiles)
* **For the Chili:**
   * 3 lbs ground beef (80/20 is a good choice for flavor)
   * 2 medium yellow onions, minced
   * 6 cloves garlic, minced
   * 1 (16 oz) cans of **El Duderino beer**
   * 2 cups low-sodium beef stock.
   * 4 tbsp masa harina
* **For the Spices & Seasoning:**
   * 2 tbsp vegetable oil (or bacon fat)
   * 1 tbsp ground cumin
   * 1 tsp dried Mexican oregano
   * 2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder
   * 1 tbsp instant espresso powder or 2 tbsp strong brewed coffee
   * 2 tsp maple syrup or dark brown sugar
   * Salt and black pepper to taste

# Instructions

1. **Prepare the Chiles:**
   * Place a skillet over medium-high heat. Toast the dried anchos, pasillas, and chipotle morita for 1-2 minutes per side until fragrant. Do not burn.
   * Stem and seed the toasted chiles. Place them in a heatproof bowl and cover with 4 cups of hot water. Let them soak for 20-30 minutes until soft and rehydrated.
   * Transfer the soaked chiles and 1 cup of the soaking liquid to a blender. Blend until a smooth paste forms. Add more soaking liquid as needed to achieve a thick, pourable consistency. Set aside.
2. **Prepare the Beef:**
   * Heat a large cast iron griddle or skillet to a high heat. Form the ground beef into 1-2 oz balls. Place them on the hot surface for a couple minutes and smash them (Those are good burgers, Walter).
   * Cook for another 2-3 minutes until a deep brown crust forms on the bottom. Flip and cook for a few more minutes.
   * Using the edge of the spatula, hand-chop the patties directly on the griddle until the beef is crumbled into small pieces. 
   * Transfer the beef to a large Dutch oven or chili pot. **Be sure to scrape any flavorful browned bits from the griddle and add them to the pot.**
3. **Build the Chili:**
   * Add the onions, garlic, cumin, and oregano to the beef in the pot. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant, stirring constantly.
   * Stir in the chili paste and cook for 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
   * Pour in the **El Duderino** and use a spatula to scrape any remaining browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.
   * Pour in the beef stock, along with the cocoa powder, espresso powder, and maple syrup. Stir to combine.
   * Bring the chili to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for at least 1 hour, or up to 3 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer it cooks, the deeper the flavor will be.
4. **Thicken and Finish:**
   * In a small bowl, whisk the masa harina with a few tablespoons of warm water until a smooth, thin slurry forms. (2 tbsp water for every tbsp masa)
   * Stir the masa slurry into the chili. It will begin to thicken immediately.
   * Serve hot with your favorite toppings.",1,1762186516.0,lebowski,1,1.0,False
1ong02u,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ong02u/coffee_helps_with_depression/,Coffee helps with depression,"Several years ago, I read a scientific publication on PubMed showing that coffee helped lift depression. As someone who has suffered with depression on and off most of my life, I did note that I felt better after leaving the church and drinking coffee regularly. I posted the article on Facebook and immediately an old bishop commented on it saying that his daughter had depression as well, but because of the word of wisdom he would never allow her to drink it, even though she’s an adult and that it’s important to follow the word of the Lord, etc. This haunts me to this day. He would rather see his daughter suffer than do one simple thing that has scientific evidence backing it, just because a swindler who peeped into a hat said so. I think of her often and hope she’s doing well. I know that’s not as traumatic as the SA and other abuses that have come out of the church, but what other things haunt you still?",1,1762186514.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

🦌☕️ Chat GPT Drafted ✍🏿🩲 Dan Page Edited

There are moments in life when you do everything right—and still get hit with the penalty.

You show up. You work hard. You stay honest. Yet somehow, others bend the rules and walk away with the win.

Ask Tom Brady. Deflategate wasn’t just about footballs — it was about reputation, perception, and resilience.

He faced headlines, suspension, and public doubt. But he came back sharper, more focused, anchored in purpose.

That’s the quiet strength of someone who learns how to rise —not in spite of pressure, but because of it.

💸 Now, look at the billionaire playbook:

Jeff Bezos reshaped modern life through Amazon. After his split, MacKenzie Scott gave billions to others. Lauren Sánchez found her voice and new direction.

Three stories — one truth:

Purpose evolves.

We mature, we shift, we shed old versions of ourselves.

The details deepen.

⚡ The Uber Era taught us speed can’t replace soul.

Convenience ≠ Connection.

Freedom ≠ Avoidance.

Real freedom comes from alignment.

💬 Lou Holtz once said:

“Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it.”

That’s the difference between being deflated and being refined.

Between being a victim of the system and being a vessel of purpose.

🎵 Even Rachel Platten’s “Fight Song” hits differently now.

It’s not just about shouting louder—it’s about growing stronger. Her words have matured with us.

Because some anthems don’t expire — they evolve, just like the hearts they inspire. ❤️‍🔥

💭 Reflection Prompts:

When was the last time life “deflated” you — and what did you learn?

Can justice and wealth coexist?

How do you define “winning” now — in peace, not just performance?

What would it mean to fight smarter this year?

🎉 And don’t forget the Kaley Cuoco Party Belt—a little reminder that joy is strength too.

Sometimes purpose needs levity. Sometimes, you win by laughing through the madness.

🌍 The world may stay inconsistent—but your integrity doesn’t have to. Your story doesn’t end at injustice. It evolves there.

⚡ Purpose doesn’t wait for fairness — it creates it.

💫 And when your heart stays steady in a shaking world, you become unstoppable.

1onfzkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1onfzkg/i_saw_the_first_superhero_end_the_world/,I Saw the First Superhero End the World,"I was sitting at my desk, thumbing through the case files of a low-level gang-slash-domestic terror group, trying to line up the evidence and witness testimony just right for a judge to approve a search warrant. The whole thing was a headache—half lies, half hearsay. I don’t spend a lot of time in the office, but when I do, I always notice the same things. The fluorescent lights hum like they’re trying to hypnotize you. That stale, overcooked coffee smell never really leaves the air. Phones ring. People talk—sometimes about leads, sometimes about weekend plans. It all kind of blurs together after a while. I was trying to make it all make sense when there was a knock at my office door.

“Come in,” I yelled, distracted, still scanning the paperwork.

I heard the door open, footsteps—two sets—and the quiet scrape of polished shoes on tile. My supervisor, sure. But the other guy? New face. He had the full federal uniform: high-and-tight haircut, no stubble in sight, fitted black suit, earpiece, and the kind of sunglasses that belonged in a spy movie, not a field office.

I’d barely registered the noise. Honestly, a grizzly bear could’ve walked in, and I probably wouldn’t have noticed. But when the stranger stepped in, something in the room shifted. Enough to make me finally look up.

“Lance, this is Special Agent Moores from the DOD. He’s come here personally to talk to you about a new case,” my supervisor said, and I could hear the tension in his voice.

The man *always* looked stressed—like the last time he slept was sometime during the Cold War. He wore his exhaustion like a uniform: bags under the eyes, crumpled shirt, coffee-stained teeth. Still, he cracked a half-smile and nodded nervously.

The Department of Defense doesn’t just *drop in* on the FBI. Not without a reason.

“Well. I’ll let you two talk it out,” he said, and ducked out of the office like he couldn’t get away fast enough.

I hadn’t really looked up until then—too wrapped up in the casework—but I finally glanced over. Moores stood there grinning like he’d just found a new toy.

“So, the rumors about you are true,” he said. “I can see why you were recommended.”

Recommended? That sounded like a headache I didn’t need.

“Special Agent… Morris?” I asked without much interest.

“Moores,” he corrected, frowning slightly.

“Look,” I said, going back to my files, “I’ve got four other cases I’m juggling, and across those, I’m managing six informants, cross-checking statements, building timelines—and I’m sure you understand how critical it is that everything adds up. So I appreciate you making the trip, but if you’re here to toss another case on my desk, I’ve got to pass.”

His smile came back like it never left.

“Special Agent Lance Taylor,” he began, like he was reading from a resume. “Started out as a DHS coordinator, managed a laundry list of high-priority events. Transferred to FBI Counterintel, where—according to your file—you’re responsible for taking down a half-dozen people who would’ve slipped right through the cracks. Calm under pressure. Solid with assets. You’re exactly who we need.”

I finally looked up at him. That smile was still there, like it was painted on. I leaned back in my shitty office chair and rubbed my eyes.

“I’m guessing you didn’t fly all the way out here to give me a compliment. Thanks, by the way. But let me tell you—”

Moores cut me off.

“First, you don’t really have a choice. Second, all your current cases are being reassigned. And third—once you find out who your new asset is, you’ll be the envy of the entire department.”

The way he said it—too slick, too casual—made it sound like we were about to go on some wild bender together. I hated him already. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t intrigued.

“Asset?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

He told me he’d explain everything once we were airborne, en route to Nevada.

Before we left, he asked if I had a go-bag ready.

Of course I did. In this line of work, you never knew when you’d get called away for a few days—or a few weeks.

We left from Andrews Air Force Base on a private jet. I sat across from Moores, arms folded, waiting for him to get to the point. It wasn’t easy letting go of the cases I’d been building for years. They’d become a part of me. But from the sound of it, I didn’t have a say in the matter.

He opened a briefcase and slid a file across the table.

“Tell me, Lance—do you believe in superheroes?”

I blinked. Thought I misheard him.

“Superheroes?” I chuckled, half annoyed. “Is this some kind of joke?”

Moores shook his head.

“I had the same reaction. But take a look.”

He tapped the file.

“Vaughn Garrison. Former Coast Guard. Master’s degree in astrophysics. Worked with NASA’s Deep Space Observatory program. On Tuesday, August 10th, 2021, an unidentified object crashed just outside the observatory. No radar signature. It was like it appeared out of nowhere.”

I opened the file. Dozens of pages, images, satellite photos, testimony.

“Vaughn was the first to investigate. Being the man of science that he is, he approached the crash site. As he got close, the object pulsed with light—then exploded. His team initially thought it was radioactive. They assumed the explosion was a reaction to something in our atmosphere.”

Moores paused, staring out the jet window before continuing.

“Emergency response was called. When they arrived, Vaughn was alive… but barely. From his navel to the top of his head, he had what looked like fourth-degree burns. Still, he was conscious. The med team ran scans—zero radiation. On the way to the hospital, they noticed something even stranger: his skin was regenerating. By the time he arrived, it looked like he had a really bad sunburn, and even that was fading fast.”

He turned back to me, his face lit up like a kid with a new toy.

“He woke up three hours later. The sudden burst of movement as he sat up nearly destroyed the hospital bed—and the ceiling above it. Then, without warning, he panicked… and began to fly.”

I stared at him, still flipping through the pages. It felt like an elaborate prank, some classified training op for an experimental prototype. But Moores wasn’t joking. He believed every word.

“After that, Washington went into full lockdown. Committees, closed-door meetings, absolute chaos. Eventually, we created ORBIT—Office for Response to Biological, Interstellar, and Technological Threats. It’s not public yet. We’re building the infrastructure as we go.”

He leaned in slightly.

“We need someone to manage him. To monitor his mental state, emotional stability, health, intent. He’s cooperative now—but let’s be honest. This guy could decide to wipe us all out tomorrow. We need someone who knows how to handle people like him. Someone he can trust.”

He smiled again.

“Between your work at FEMA and the Bureau, you were unanimously chosen.”

Still trying to process what I’d just heard, I thumbed through Vaughn’s file in silence.

Born in Galveston, Texas. Parents: Troy and Rita Garrison. A solid B-average student. Joined the Coast Guard at 18. Earned commendations for his response during Hurricane Ike. Attended the University of Texas, then got his master’s from Caltech. Later recruited to NASA’s Deep Space program.

A model citizen.

The file was filled with service photos—Coast Guard operations, graduation ceremonies, trips to the Grand Canyon, amusement parks, childhood birthdays. Just… normal stuff. The kind of stuff that makes it harder to believe he could become a walking nuclear event.

We landed at Nellis Air Force Base, where I was led to a massive white tent—one of those temporary government field labs, the kind with more secrecy than walls. Armed military police patrolled the perimeter in tight loops.

“No one gets within fifty feet of the walls without clearance,” Moores said with a grin. “MPs have orders to shoot on sight if anyone does.”

Inside, the tent was part science lab, part command center. Equipment I didn’t recognize. Monitors, scanners, data feeds. A constant low hum of activity.

And in the center of it all… was him.

Vaughn Garrison. He looked nervous. Confused. Like a man who’d stumbled into the wrong room and wasn’t sure how to leave without making it worse.

His medium-brown hair was messy, like he’d been running a hand through it for hours. He had a stocky, compact build—denser than his photos suggested, like he was built to take hits. The kid in the file looked average. The man standing in front of me didn’t. Not anymore. He was being scanned by a scientist with some handheld device while another scribbled notes so furiously it was like the pen might catch fire.

Moores waved the scientists away. “Vaughn, meet your liaison—Special Agent Lance Taylor. He’s here to give a face to this new... situation we’re all adjusting to.”

Vaughn turned to me with a faint, uncertain smile. You could tell he’d been through hell. There was something in his eyes—strain, maybe, or confusion just barely hidden under the surface. Whatever it was, it didn’t match the calm, smiling kid I’d just seen in those photos. This was someone trying hard to hold it together.

“Hello, Special Agent Taylor,” he said, almost timid.

I extended my hand, but he shook his head. “I’m sorry. I’m not used to my strength yet. I don’t want to hurt you.” First time someone ever apologized for not shaking my hand—and meant it.

“Understandable, son,” I said, letting my hand drop.

Moores excused himself to get an update, leaving the two of us standing there under the glare of bright halogen lights. As soon as he was gone, Vaughn relaxed a little, like he could finally breathe again.

“So, how are you feeling, Mr. Garrison?” I asked.

For a second, I saw a flicker of relief cross his face—like no one had thought to ask him that since the whole nightmare started.

““You’re the first person who’s asked me that.Everyone else just wants readings or reports.Honestly?” he said, his voice shaking. “I’m nervous. They keep calling me the world’s first superhero. They say I can do good, but right now I feel like a lab rat. They’re trying to come up with some kind of training regimen, I think.”

He hesitated, then added, “They say it’s about helping people, making the world safer… but I think it’s also about showing off. Improving America's image. Maybe even flaunting their new weapon.”

I glanced around the tent. No one was paying us attention. I lowered my voice.

“Do you want to be a superhero?”

That caught him off guard. He looked at me like no one had ever asked him that either. Maybe they hadn’t.

He thought for a while before answering.

“Yes and no,” he said finally. “I mean… I’m living every kid’s dream. I was given these abilities. I should use them for something good, right? When I was in the Coast Guard, there were things I couldn’t stop—people I couldn’t save. Now I can. But… I get it. The government’s scared. Hell, I’m scared. I just want to make a difference, that’s all.”

His expression softened, his fear replaced by a small spark of hope. And even though I’d known him for maybe five minutes, that flicker of optimism rubbed off on me.

A few months passed. ORBIT had developed a full training program to help Vaughn harness his powers—flight stabilization, light projection, energy control. They called him Vanguard. Blue suit, red and gold trim, half-mask for plausible deniability. Someone upstairs thought the ‘V’ and ‘G’ logo combo made him look like a patriotic baseball team. But the kid wore it well…and the public ate it up. What got me was the branding. Red “V,” blue “G” outlined in gold—same as his initials. Vaughn Garrison.

That might’ve been a coincidence. Or it might’ve been cooked up before he even agreed to it. I didn’t ask. Didn’t want to know.



Soon after, they introduced him to the world.

The rollout was cautious at first, His first big save? A collapsed bridge in Denver. Forty-seven people pulled out of the wreckage. Footage of him lifting a school bus one-handed hit twelve million views in two hours. And just like that, Vanguard was a household name. Public reaction was mixed. Some people were inspired. Others were terrified. The religious crowd said he was an omen. The conspiracy types swore he was a weapon. But after he started saving people—disasters, hostage situations, floods—the tide turned. The world fell in love with Vanguard.

ORBIT expanded fast—too fast. What started as a small, closed-door task force turned into a multinational agency with authority across borders. Officially, they operated under global cooperation treaties. Unofficially? Some nations were getting nervous. Everyone was watching Vanguard like he was a loaded gun pointed at the planet.

A year later, a freak flood hit Tennessee.The air smelled like rot and diesel. Vaughn looked like a walking corpse by the end of it, soaked, drained, still moving. I’d never seen him tired before. That scared me more than anything. Vaughn worked around the clock for a week straight, barely stopping to eat. He redirected rivers, pulled families from rooftops, cleared debris with energy constructs. I might’ve slept eight hours the whole week, tops. Vaughn saved hundreds.

When the immediate danger passed, ORBIT told us to stand down. Vaughn could’ve flown back to D.C. in an hour, but I convinced him to ride back with the team. Washington wanted regular mental health assessments—no surprise there. They were terrified he’d snap.

Normally, he was upbeat, always cracking jokes or asking about my cases back at the Bureau. But that time, he seemed distant. Tired.

“You doing alright, V?” I asked.

He didn’t answer at first—just stared out the window like he wasn’t really there.

“Come on, man. You can tell me.”

“I’m fine,” he said eventually. “Just… weird dreams, that’s all.”

“Dreams?” I pressed.

He rubbed the back of his neck, frowning. “Yeah, but that’s the thing—I don’t remember them. I just wake up in a cold sweat. Sometimes I feel like I’ve been running, or fighting. But I never remember what it was.”

That caught my attention. Whatever could shake a man like Vanguard must’ve been one hell of a dream.

He looked over at me and smiled weakly. “You know, Lance, thanks for being my friend. I know you’re my handler, but you actually… care. I appreciate that.”

It caught me off guard.

“It’s no problem, kid. You’re doing good work. You’ve saved a lot of lives.”

He nodded and went quiet again.

At the time, I told myself it was nothing. Just exhaustion. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried.

Months went by. Vaughn became a natural at the job. He moved with confidence now—saving lives, preventing disasters, representing something people hadn’t felt in a long time: hope.

One morning, I was buried under a pile of emails—thank-you notes, media requests, the usual PR circus—when my office phone rang. It was Ron, one of the senior monitoring advisers.

“Hey, Lance… uh, I need you to come down here. Now,” he said. His voice was low and tense, like a man trying to disarm a bomb with shaking hands.

That tone got my attention. I made my way to his office.

Ron’s workspace looked like NASA control had a baby with the Weather Channel—rows of monitors showing international news, seismic graphs, radar data, security feeds, live cams. He looked pale, jittery.

“What’s going on?” I asked.

“Vanguard’s been doing… strange things,” he said. He gestured at his screens.

I stepped closer. Each monitor showed footage from around the world—Tokyo, Moscow, Rome, Berlin, Rio. Vaughn was in every one of them, standing completely still. Same posture. Same blank expression. Just… staring.

“He’s been appearing in random locations across the globe,” Ron said, voice trembling. “All this happened within about four hours.”

I felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck.

“You’re saying he’s teleporting?”

“I don’t know what to call it,” Ron said. “We can’t track him. He’s there one second, gone the next. And in every clip, he looks—” He stopped himself. “It’s not good optics, Lance. The higher-ups are calling it ‘international vigilance,’ but… the countries he’s been popping up in? They’re not buying it.”

Yeah. A superhuman god-figure silently appearing in your streets doesn’t exactly scream friendly.

I called Vaughn immediately and asked him to come in.

When he arrived, I showed him the footage. His reaction was genuine shock.

“What? I don’t remember any of this,” he said, eyes wide. “When was this?”

Ron ran him through the timestamps, the locations. Vaughn just kept shaking his head.

“I don’t know… maybe I was sleepwalking? I swear, I don’t remember.” His expression shifted from confusion to horror, like he was realizing something inside him might not belong to him anymore.

“I know you’re not gonna like this,” I said carefully, “but they’re probably going to want to put a tracker on you. Just until we figure this out.”

He nodded slowly, still pale. “Yeah. Okay.”

I turned to leave when Ron stopped me.

“There’s one more thing,” he said quietly. He entered a password and opened a hidden folder on his system. “I didn’t show this to the higher-ups. Figured it’d only cause a panic. But you need to see it.”

The video feed came up—a small-town post office in South Dakota. Vaughn stood beside a mailbox, motionless at first. Then he started laughing. Not a normal laugh—this was deeper, rawer. The kind of laugh you hear right before someone breaks completely.

There was no audio, but just watching it chilled me to my core. Something about it felt wrong. Ancient, even.

Ron’s fingers trembled on the mouse. He didn’t blink while the footage played. His lips were pressed into a tight line like he was holding something in—or holding something back.

Ron shut the video off. The silence that followed felt heavy.

“Unsettling” didn’t even begin to describe it. Something in my gut twisted, and I knew, deep down, that this wasn’t over.





There were no more incidents for a while.

I told the brass Vaughn had been under pressure, probably sleepwalking due to stress. They didn’t buy it entirely, but they didn’t want to push too hard, either. Washington was still walking the razor’s edge—trying to manage him without provoking him.

They agreed: he’d wear a tracker, but only while he slept. A compromise, they said. Temporary.

Weeks passed.

The dreams started soon after.

At first, they were the kind you don’t remember. I’d wake up in a cold sweat with the distinct sensation that something had happened. My heart would be pounding, my skin cold, my mouth dry.

Then the dreams started to take shape.

In them, I was alone in a white void—no sound, no temperature, just a colorless space that stretched on forever. I walked slowly, head down, watching my feet move like I wasn’t really in control of them. Then, I’d feel something—like gravity shifting.

I’d stop.

And I’d look up.

There it stood.

A thing. Massive. The only way I can describe it is some kind of deer—if a deer were the size of a skyscraper and carved from dark matter. Its body was an inky, ocean-deep blue, like the sea under a starless sky. Its antlers branched like the limbs of trees or the tendrils of galaxies—mountains of bone reaching in every direction, each one wrapped in swirling nebulae.

Its eyes…

Its eyes pierced through me.

Two where they should be. And a third—dead center in its forehead. Triangular in placement. Immense. Endless.

All three stared at me.

And in that gaze, I felt stripped of everything. Not just clothes or skin, but identity. I was a flea beneath a god. I was nothing.

Then I’d wake up. Heart racing. Gasping.

The dreams came every few days.

At first, I tried to dismiss them—stress, trauma, whatever. But deep down, I knew. People don’t dream the same dream over and over unless something’s wrong.

In one dream, I looked closer at one of the flowers blooming on the deer’s back. Inside its open petals… I swear I saw Vaughn’s face. Not the man he was—but the boy. Smiling. Waiting. Like he’d been part of this all along.

Weeks passed. Vaughn seemed normal—more confident, more polished. He was becoming the face of global protection.

Until NASA called.

It was a quiet Thursday morning. An object had entered Earth’s atmosphere—fast, humanoid-shaped, and not of this world.

I grabbed Vaughn, and we deployed via ORBIT helicopter. Just before boarding, that deer flashed in my mind again. No reason. Just… popped in. I shook it off.

The impact site wasn’t far. Vaughn got there first. I radioed in for an update.

“Uh… so,” his voice crackled through the comms, “you guys remember Close Encounters? Well… imagine that alien on steroids.”

We arrived minutes later.

The thing standing in the middle of a destroyed cornfield looked like a textbook alien—gray skin, huge black eyes—but it had four arms, each one the size of a human torso, and it stood almost ten feet tall. Muscle packed onto muscle. Like it had been built for one thing only: violence.

It charged Vaughn immediately.

No monologue. No first contact. No explanation.

Just war.

The alien moved like a blur—arms whipping in a whirlwind of punches like some nightmare version of a gatling gun. Vaughn tanked it. Took every hit on the chin and answered with a cross that would’ve decapitated a lesser being.

The alien staggered but came back with a haymaker that sent Vaughn into the earth—literally embedded him into the dirt.

We were all holding our breath.

Then something happened.

Something wrong.

Vaughn’s body started to glow—not the usual golden light we’d come to expect, but a pale, icy blue. His energy shifted. And so did his posture.

He stood up, slow. Too slow. Like something else was piloting him.

And then—he snapped.

Aggressive. Unrelenting. Furious.

He attacked with a brutality I’d never seen. Not just from him. From anyone.

He tore into the alien. Ripped off all four of its arms. Slammed it into the ground. Then fired a focused beam of light—blue, not gold—directly through its chest. A clean hole, maybe a foot wide.

The fight was over in under a minute.

We were stunned. Not because he won—but because of how he did it. There was no restraint. No control. Just annihilation.

We recovered the body. Vaughn sat near the helicopter, sipping bottled water, silent.

“That was pretty incredible,” I said, trying to keep my voice level. “I didn’t know you had—”

I froze.

His face.

That thousand-yard stare. Eyes wide, mouth slack, barely blinking. The dread hit me in the stomach like a cold hammer.

“That… that wasn’t me,” he said.

He looked up at me, pleading.

“Lance, I blacked out. One second I’m fighting—then I come to, and it’s over. I don’t remember any of it. I don’t like that I don’t remember.”

His voice cracked.

“What’s happening to me?”

I didn’t know. Not really. But something about him… something in his voice, or in his eyes, felt wrong. Like a storm gathering behind clear skies.



And I couldn’t shake it.



We ran every test we could think of. Physically, he was fine. Stable vitals. Normal scans. But there was something new—a faint frequency variation coming from him. Background noise, the scientists said. Nothing to worry about.

I worried anyway.

Vanguard was put on sabbatical.

We told him to rest, see his parents, try to reconnect with normal life. He agreed. His parents were proud. Supportive. They had no idea what was really going on. Hell, I wasn’t sure I knew what was going on.

Meanwhile, the dreams got worse.

Now, instead of just seeing the deer, I was floating beside it. Flying in that empty void, watching the beast move beneath me like a living mountain of starlight and smoke.

Its fur shimmered like mist, coiling and shifting like fog over a dark moor. But hidden in that mist—if you looked closely enough—were flowers. Small, delicate blooms, barely visible, scattered across its body like stars in a constellation.

Each flower opened slowly.

Inside each one… a face.

Some looked like the alien Vaughn had killed. Others were stranger—reptilian, insectoid, one like a twisted anteater.

And all of them were laughing.

Not just laughing—singing, in a way that became laughter. Or maybe it was the other way around.

And then… I started to laugh with them.



I wasn’t sleeping much anymore.

Caffeine pills, energy drinks, whiskey—whatever it took to stay awake. I’d tried quitting a few times. Couldn’t take the stress. But every time I got close, the higher-ups reminded me that Vaughn only trusted me. Switching handlers could destabilize him, they said. Could trigger something.

That’s the last thing anybody wanted.



Something new hit Earth’s radar at 9:12 a.m.

Not from space this time. The trajectory didn’t match any known meteor pattern; it just appeared in the middle of a small New Jersey town.

Reports came in describing a thirteen-foot wolf-shaped creature, armor-plated hide, a single golden eye burning in its skull. It didn’t talk. It didn’t roar. It simply stood—and then started tearing through everything in reach.

ORBIT scrambled every resource we had. Vanguard led the charge.

He came in fast, a streak of blue and gold against a gray morning sky, and hit the thing like a missile. For twenty minutes they fought—punches like thunderclaps, shock waves rippling through the air. Vaughn finally won, driving the monster into the ground hard enough to crack pavement three streets over.

The world cheered again.

From my monitor in D.C., I watched it unfold in real time. For a moment, pride bloomed in my chest. Then he turned toward one of the cameras.

And I saw it.

Just for a heartbeat.

A third eye, glowing faintly on his forehead—exactly like the deer from my dreams.

When I blinked, it was gone. I replayed the footage again and again, frame by frame. Nothing. But I knew what I’d seen.

That night, back in my apartment, I poured a glass of whiskey, swallowed a couple of sleeping pills, and tried to convince myself I was hallucinating. My coffee table was littered with Vaughn’s files. I flipped through them out of habit—birth records, Coast Guard commendations, family photos.

One picture stopped me cold.

Vaughn at maybe fourteen, posing at a wildlife museum, a stuffed deer in the background. His shirt said Space Camp, his grin wide and goofy. But just above his brow, in the grain of the photo, was a faint mark—like a third eye burned into the film.

I slammed the file shut.

I turned on the TV for distraction, anything but that goddamn deer. The local news was covering a new “laughter epidemic.” People were breaking into hysterics in public—doctors baffled, psychologists overwhelmed. I killed the power and went to bed, praying the drugs and alcohol would finally drown the dreams.

They didn’t.

The laughter followed me there.



More creatures began to fall from the sky.

One in South Carolina—a tank-sized hybrid of mammoth and gorilla. Then Paris. Moscow. Beijing. Tokyo. Dallas. Salt Lake City. Green Bay. Cuba. Each one worse than the last.

Every two or three weeks another impact. Each battle left another city in ruins.

And each time, only Vanguard stood between us and extinction.

He fought relentlessly, but the fights were getting longer. The shine in his eyes dimmed. Between missions he’d sit in silence, hands trembling, as if something inside him was eating away at his humanity.

Public opinion shifted from worship to fear. People didn’t question if he’d lose—they wondered what would happen when he did.

We examined the remains of every creature he killed. Radiation-proof. Bio-proof. Resistant to heat, cold, acid, vacuum. Nothing on Earth could have hurt them—except him.

Meanwhile, I was falling apart.

Sleep was a rumor. My veins buzzed with caffeine and morphine. I told myself I needed them just to function, but truth was, I couldn’t face closing my eyes. The dreams had become too vivid.

One night, after a cleanup operation in Los Angeles, I saw it sprayed across a half-collapsed wall:

A blue deer with three eyes.

Underneath, in dripping paint: You will all sing for me.

I wanted to tear my own brain out.



Then came the big one.

The sky split open above Branson, Missouri. A shape fell through—part squid, part demon, all nightmare. Its tentacles blotted out the sun. Power grids failed for a hundred miles.

Vanguard went in first, but this time the monster swatted him out of the air like a fly. He hit the ground at the speed of a meteor, got back up, tried again. Over and over. Each time slower. We could feel the hopelessness radiating across the world.

Then something changed.

The cameras caught it first—a glow, bright enough to turn night into day. Vaughn rose from the crater, body blazing with the same cold blue light as before, but stronger. His form sharpened until he looked carved from living energy.

And then I saw them.

Antlers.

Rising from his skull like radiant branches. A third eye burning in the center of his forehead.

I fell to my knees. Around me, people began to snicker. At first, soft. Then louder. Then uncontrollable.

Vaughn—no, whatever he’d become—raised one shining hand. A blinding flash filled the city. When it cleared, the demon was gone. Not destroyed—erased.

No cheering this time. Just silence. Awe. Dread.

He drifted upward and flew away.



They found him later, standing on the roof of ORBIT headquarters, motionless, overlooking D.C.

Tests said he was alive—heartbeat, brain activity, everything normal—but he didn’t move. Didn’t eat. Didn’t speak.

For three weeks he stood there, a statue of light.

During that time, I maybe slept five hours total. My body was collapsing. The morphine barely took the edge off. The dreams had become constant—no longer visions but realities I visited every time I blinked.

The deer filled them all. The flowers on its body bloomed and sang. I laughed until I cried, until I thought my skull would split.

Finally, I broke.

I went to confront him.

I looked like hell—stained shirt, shaking hands, pupils the size of quarters—but I didn’t care. I knew how to move through ORBIT’s security without being noticed. I’d been there from the start.

When I reached the roof, he was still standing there, glowing against the night sky.

“What do you want?” I shouted. My voice cracked. “Answer me, you big blue deer bastard! Answer me!”

My knees buckled. I sobbed into my palms.

Then—movement.

He turned.

My stomach clenched like someone had dropped a live wire inside me. He looked down with that same blank expression, then smiled—a huge, unnatural grin—and shot into the sky.

The alarms went off seconds later.

He was heading for D.C. proper.

I followed the task force in a convoy, sirens screaming. By the time we arrived… the White House was gone. So were half the monuments.

Crowds had gathered—senators, staffers, civilians—all staring upward with the same empty expression.

I shoved through them until I could see.

Vanguard floated above the crater, rearranging debris—bricks, steel, dirt—into a massive throne on the White House lawn. When it was finished, he sat down.

Then the laughter started again.

First a few chuckles. Then hundreds. Then thousands.

Until the whole world was laughing.

I don’t know how long it’s been.

Years, maybe. Decades. Centuries.

Time stopped meaning anything the moment the world began to laugh.

When every voice on Earth joined that sound—pure, unhinged laughter rising like a tidal wave—it was as if reality itself cracked open.

And we… changed.

I watched it happen.

People around me started to convulse. Not in pain—more like they were giving in to something. Legs split and stretched, feet driving into the soil like roots. Arms unfolded into long green leaves. Faces bloomed into petals—soft, vivid, impossibly beautiful.

Every human being became a flower.

Not metaphorically. Not symbolically. Literally.

I don’t know why I stayed as I am. Maybe something in me held on. Maybe the drugs in my system disrupted the process. Maybe I was cursed to remember.

Or maybe… he left me behind on purpose.

I’ve watched them ever since. The flowers. They don’t move. Don’t wilt. They just exist—frozen in praise.

And he watches them.

Vanguard.

Still seated on his throne of twisted stone and memory. Glowing faintly blue. Antlers curled toward the stars. The third eye in his forehead never closes.

At some point, he stood and descended from the throne.

He walked straight to me.

I should’ve screamed. Run. Prayed. But I couldn’t move. Couldn’t blink.

He looked down at what was left of me. Not with malice. Not with joy.

With… sorrow.

A single word escaped him.

“I’m sorry.”

And then he turned and returned to his throne, surrounded by a garden of blooming souls singing their endless laughter‑song to a god who never asked to be worshipped.

I used to think my job was to protect people. Keep the chaos out. But I see it now—

I was just a witness. The last one left to remember the world before.

The last one still asking questions no one wants answered.

Maybe that’s what I was chosen for.

Not to stop the end.

Just to see it happen

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1onfx4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1onfx4p/the_choice_by_jim_barnes/,The Choice by Jim Barnes,"He had everything he thought he wanted.
Alex had married the girl of his dreams. They had three beautiful children, a tidy house in a
quiet neighborhood, and friends who thought they were the model family. He had a solid job, a
respectable title, and the comfort of knowing the bills were paid on time. They weren’t rich,
but they weren’t struggling either.
By all appearances, Alex was living the good life.
Diane was a devoted wife and a remarkable mother. She loved their children fiercely, kept
their home spotless, and ran their lives with smooth precision.
But there was a problem.
None of it was what Alex wanted.
At work, he played the part of a team player. He smiled at the right moments, cracked jokes,
hit his targets, and made the quarterly numbers. His boss liked him because he was
steady—never too ambitious, never too loud. When tension flared, Alex calmed the room. He
was dependable.
Yet he despised almost everyone he worked with. The small talk, the competition, the false
cheer—they all made him feel hollow. Sales wasn’t a career; it was a performance he no longer
believed in.
Outside the office, his calendar overflowed. He volunteered, attended board meetings, and
served as an usher at the Presbyterian church. The pastor was relentless—another fundraiser,
another pledge drive, another “opportunity to give.” The sermons felt rehearsed, the prayers
transactional.
He still believed in God. Just not the one they kept selling on Sunday mornings.
And then there was Diane.
The intimacy between them had thinned to habit. She no longer met his eyes when they made
love, and sometimes flinched when he brushed her shoulder. There was always something
more important—a meeting at school, a load of laundry, a child’s science project. He didn’t
doubt she loved him, but often he felt she didn’t like him very much. Her tone could turn
sharp, her patience brittle.
The truth was simple and brutal: he didn’t like her either.
One morning he stood before the full-length mirror. The reflection startled him. Twenty-five
pounds heavier than on his wedding day. Thinning hair, soft jawline, dark half-moons beneath
tired eyes. His shirt clung in the wrong places. He wondered if any woman—anyone—would
find him attractive now.
He didn’t recognize the man staring back.
As always, he told himself to suck it up. “You’ve got responsibilities. Be grateful. Don’t
whine.”
He thought about talking to someone—but who? The pastor was out of the question. His
friends would leak every word to their wives, and the wives would report to Diane. A barstool
confession wasn’t his style. Therapy? No chance. People would think he’d lost it.
He wasn’t depressed, he told himself. Just trapped.
And there was no escape.
Still, the walls of his life seemed to close in tighter each week.
---
It was a Sunday morning. The house smelled of pancakes and coffee. The kids were running
through the kitchen, half-dressed for church.
“I think I’ll skip today,” Alex said quietly.
Diane stopped mid-motion. “You feeling okay?”
“I’m fine. Just… don’t feel like church this morning.”
She studied him for a moment. “You should do something you want to do, then. You’ve
seemed… off lately.”
“Yeah,” he said. “Maybe I will.”
Twenty minutes later, Diane had corralled the kids into the minivan. When the engine faded
down the street, a strange silence filled the house.
He stood there for a long moment, unsure what to do. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d
been home alone.
The day was radiant—blue sky, sunlight spilling through the oaks. He grabbed his keys. “A
drive,” he thought. “Windows down, music loud.”
---
He took the river road out of town, where the air smelled of water and wildflowers. For the
first time in months, he felt something like peace.
After half an hour, he slowed as he entered a small town with a reputation for ticketing
speeders. The place looked unchanged since the fifties—two blocks of storefronts, an old clock
tower, and a coffee shop called Mabel’s.
He pulled over.
Inside, the place was quiet except for the low hum of an old ceiling fan. A handful of tables, a
counter stacked with pastries, the scent of cinnamon and frying dough.
“Looks like I came at a good time,” Alex said to the woman behind the counter.
She smiled. “The calm before the storm. Give it thirty minutes—once church lets out, this
place’ll be packed. What can I get you, hon?”
“Large coffee to go,” he said, “and one of those apple fritters.”
As she turned to fill his order, he noticed an older man sitting by the front window, sipping
coffee and watching the street. The man caught his eye and smiled.
“Good morning, friend.”
“Morning,” Alex said, returning the smile.
The woman slid his order across the counter. “That’ll be six fifty. Cream and sugar’s over
there.”
As he moved toward the condiment station, the old man spoke again.
“If you’re not in a hurry, why don’t you sit down and enjoy that fritter before it gets cold?”
Alex hesitated.
The man chuckled softly. “Don’t worry. I already had mine. Sit.”
Something about the tone—gentle, assured—made it impossible to refuse.
Alex sat. “Thanks. I’m Alex.”
“Richard,” the man said, extending a hand. “Nice to meet you. What brings you to our little
town?”
“Just out for a drive,” Alex said. “Thought I’d clear my head.”
“How’s that working for you?”
“Better than I expected. The coffee’s great.”
Richard smiled. “Wait till you try the fritter.”
Alex took a bite. The crust shattered delicately, the apple filling warm and sweet. “You
weren’t kidding.”
Richard nodded. “Married man, I see.” He glanced at Alex’s ring. “How long?”
“Twelve years.”
“Kids?”
“Three.”
“Lucky man.”
Alex’s voice faltered. “Yeah… lucky, I guess.”
Richard watched him carefully. “Where are they now?”
“At church,” Alex said. “I just needed a break.”
“Ah,” Richard said knowingly. “Church fatigue.”
Alex laughed. “You could call it that. You ever feel like church is more about money than
faith?”
Richard’s eyes glimmered. “That’s why I stopped going.”
“So you don’t believe anymore?”
“On the contrary,” he said softly. “I believe more than ever. But I talk to God directly. No
middleman taking a cut.”
Alex grinned. “That’s one way to put it.”
Richard leaned back. “So what’s really going on, Alex?”
Alex looked down. “You don’t even know me.”
“I don’t have to.”
He sighed. “I love my family. I really do. But sometimes… I feel trapped. Like I built a life I
can’t escape.”
Richard nodded slowly. “You ever think about free will?”
“Sure. God gave us free will. That’s what we’re taught.”
Richard’s gaze didn’t waver. “Then consider this: your life, as it stands, is the direct result of
your choices.”
Alex frowned. “You’re saying I did this to myself?”
“Exactly.”
“Then what am I supposed to do?”
“That’s not my call. It’s yours.”
“So I could just keep driving? Leave it all behind?”
“If that’s what you choose.”
Alex’s voice rose. “That would make me an awful person.”
“I don’t think you’re awful,” Richard said. “Just lost. Forgetful. You’ve forgotten that you still
have choices—and that rest isn’t a sin.”
Alex looked at him sharply. “I’ve had some bad thoughts lately. Things I can’t tell anyone.”
Richard’s voice softened. “Nothing’s wrong with you, son. You’re not trapped. You’re just
tired. You’re surrounded by people who love you, even when you can’t feel it. Take time when
you need it. Step away if you must. But don’t abandon the life you built—it’s full of grace,
even if it’s messy.”
Alex sat back, feeling the words settle deep inside him like warm light.
“You’re right,” he said quietly. “I’ve been blind to my blessings. I don’t need to run away.”
He noticed Richard’s mug was empty. “Let me get you a refill.”
Richard smiled. “That’d be kind of you.”
Alex went to the counter. “Another coffee for my friend.”
The woman blinked. “Friend? You’re the only one here, sweetheart.”
He turned, startled. The seat across from his was empty.
“Must’ve stepped outside,” he murmured. “Make it to go.”
She handed him the cup with a puzzled look.
Alex stepped out into the sunlight, scanning the street. The town was quiet. No sign of
Richard.
He stood for a long moment, the two cups warm in his hands, before walking to his car.
---
When he pulled into the driveway, Diane’s van was already there. The front door opened as he
got out.
“How was church?” he asked.
She smiled faintly. “Same old pitch for money.”
He laughed softly and held up the extra coffee. “Brought you something.”
She took it, surprised. “Thank you.”
“Apple fritters too,” he said. “Best you’ll ever have.”
As she went to call the kids, Alex stepped into the kitchen and set his own cup on the counter
beside hers. He looked at them—two steaming cups side by side—and for the first time in
years, he felt something shift inside him.
He wasn’t sure who Richard was—or if he’d ever been there at all.
But the warmth of that second cup lingered in the air, like a quiet reminder.
He wasn’t trapped. He had chosen this life.
And today, finally, he chose it again.",1,1762186331.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1onfwdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancun/comments/1onfwdq/catalonia_grand_costa_mujeres_review/,Catalonia Grand Costa Mujeres Review,"Just came back from a week long stay at Catalonia Grand Costa Mujeres and here are my thoughts:

Pros:
- Food was surprisingly good and there were a lot of options including steak, mexican, italian, vegetarian, asian, and peruvian. There is also 24/7 room service and a grab as you go buffet. Also, a cafe that serves great desserts and coffee. Nothing we saw you had to pay extra for.
- We had the privileged suite & swim up which was a huge room and very clean.
- Service was amazing and all the staff were very nice at restaurants, poolside, and for cleaning.
- Booking through the Catalonia website was very easy and all of our flight information and airpott transports were so smooth.
- Super easy to book excursions through their representative in the lobby.
- For Privileged suite guests, you get a free hydrotherapy spa treatment which I highly recommend doing!

Cons:
- Exclusive Traveller's Club. This is an organization built into the Catalonia brand that is essentially a timeshare/traveller's club. We woke up one morning and the HOTEL FRONT DESK called our room saying to come down to the lobby to collect a ""welcome gift"". When we got there, there was the Exclusive Traveller's Club representative waiting to bring us to a breakfast and give us ""discounts"" in exchange for attending a ""presentation"". We declined but they were very pushy and after searching this up, the discounts are never as good as they say they are. There are about 3-4 ETC reps around the main lobby area at all times and this is just something you need to ignore and go about your day. Unless you want to pay thousands of dollars for feeling a little more exclusive.
- We got food poisoning. We went to the fish tacos food truck (Yummy State) and after the first bite noticed it was a bit fishy. After the second bite we could feel it was a bit rancid and slimey. But it was too late, we both got Scromboid food poisoning, with our skin turning bright red and irritable and had diahhrea for 3 days (search up scromboid food poisoning for symptoms). Luckily, we had this on the last day. When we were leaving we overhead another couple talking about food poisoning and stomache pains so we know this was not just us. Pretty concerning for them to not keep their seafood at safe temperatures, considering this was a cooked fish taco and they had raw seafood options.

Overall, the resort was great. But the cons heavily overshadowed the pros and make us hesitant to come back to another Catalonia branded hotel. Let me know your thoughts if you've been or plan on going!",1,1762186286.0,cancun,1,1.0,False

1onfv2a,https://www.fotbollskanalen.se/lundhs-podcast/sundgren-upplevde-riggade-matcher-i-grekland-skamdes-som-en-hund/,Sundgren experienced match fixing in Greece: ‘Ashamed as a dog’,"# Sundgren experienced rigged matches in Greece: ""Ashamed as a dog""

Some matches Daniel Sundgren played in Greece were rigged.  
In the spring, Volos' club officials had arranged which teams would win - to secure places in the top league.  
\- It ended up with me having anxiety attacks, says the Degerfors defender in the podcast Lundh.



Daniel Sundgren spent the 2024/25 season in Volos in Greece, and it was there that he experienced things that he is ashamed of today. In the podcast Lundh, the 34-year-old reveals that he feels that some matches Volos played during his time at the club were fixed.

Neither Sundgren nor his teammates were involved in the fixing, but it was the president and people connected to him who were able to openly tell the players how things would play out in a specific match and what sporting outcome it would be, claims the Degerfors defender. And then it happened.

He gives an example from the Greek relegation series this spring. Sundgren's experience is that the outcome of two matches was determined in advance to ensure that both Volos and another team would remain in the top league. Volos won one match 3-0 and lost the other 3-0 - after which both teams managed to stay.

  


The rigging took place above the players' heads, but before the aforementioned matches the squad was made aware of what would happen, says Sundgren.

\- I can barely mention it. In the locker room before the match, we were told that ""today you are not going to take the ball"" and ""today he and he will be brought down in the penalty area, so we will get a penalty with us,"" he says in the podcast Lundh.

**Who said that? Was it another player?**  
\- The president. The coach.

**Were there any fixed matches?**  
\- Yes, and you felt ashamed. After all, I played with four Scandinavians and that doesn't happen in Scandinavia.

**Although now there are examples. They tried in AIK when you were there. You can't always say that it doesn't exist, but I understand what you mean. There may be more and it may be more common in other countries.**  
\- I don't know, I've never been involved in anything like this anyway. This was like before the curtain opened.

  


**Did you say anything?**  
\- To the players, I said. Then you couldn't open your mouth to those who made the decisions, they're the ones who pay you a salary, after all. But it's clear that you went out and were ashamed like a dog.

**Did you lose those games?**  
\- The thing is, there was a playout.

**A relegation series?**  
\- Yes, exactly. Then the team we faced needed to take points and we needed to take points. The series turned. So what did they do? We gave them three points and they gave us three points, so both were happy. It was 3-0 to them and 3-0 to us. Those who were below us in the table were of course unhappy.

The purpose of the rigged matches was therefore to have a certain sporting impact rather than to make money, if Sundgren's description is to be interpreted.

Sundgren himself emphasizes that he had no involvement whatsoever in the fixing of results. But the fact that he ended up in the middle of it in Volos has left its mark on the 34-year-old.

  


\- I had no part in it, but when you sat in the locker room and absorbed that it could be like that in a top league that is ranked very high. Then you were ashamed. You felt like you didn't want to be part of it. It's disgusting, says Sundgren in the podcast.

**What did the other players say?**  
\- I think the Greeks are so used to it that they shrug their shoulders. They simply do as they are told.

**Were you afraid when you were part of it that maybe you wouldn't go out and tell the Greek newspapers about it?**  
\- We are foreigners. We don't know what is written in the media and we don't have the same knowledge. Then Greece has so many international players that there are only two or three Greeks who know about this. But since we had all the briefings in English, we found out about it.

**So you knew that ""he's going to get knocked down and get a punishment"" and then you saw it happen?** 

  


\- Yes, it was surreal. I don't even know what to say. I ended up having anxiety attacks. When I returned home to Degerfors and landed in Sweden, I had to go to the hospital the first day. I had such a lump in my stomach and I had a real anxiety attack.

**If this comes out now and the Greek league and such were to approach you, what would you say?**  
\- I would just tell the truth, there is nothing to hide. I think people already know.

**Because this is ruining football.**  
\- Yes, it's terrible. The football that you've played since you were a child. As I said, I didn't notice anything about it Aris. Even though some things were like: ""Why did he shoot it out for a corner again? You can clear it for a throw-in. In training you clear it for a throw-in every single time, but now suddenly you gave the opponents 2-3 corners in a row"". It was a bit suspicious in that way, but there were no facts there.

  


Sundgren, who returned home to Sweden and Degerfors this summer, continues:

\- In Volos, the curtain was open. They didn't tell us that ""today you're going to lose 3-0"". But we even heard from the away team's supporters when we were sitting and drinking coffee that ""is it 3-0 today or not?"" Then we looked at each other and just ""yeah, yes it is then"" - then it was 3-0. 

**But it was still the case that on certain occasions the president came in and said ""today this is what matters""?**  
\- We know that it is the president's decision, but it came via some who were under him. You didn't really know who they were. They had no roles in the club, but they were more like friends of his.

If you look back at the Greek relegation series from last spring, Volos hosted Panserraikos at home and won 3-0, followed by a 0-3 loss to the same team away in the round. Daniel Sundgren played 71 minutes in the first match and was the one who was penalized when Volos got a penalty that led to a 1-0 win. In the return match, Sundgren was on the bench but had to come on after 33 minutes due to an injury to a teammate and by then another teammate had already been sent off.

  


In the final table, Panserraikos managed to stay with one point and Volos with three points. Both teams play in the Greek top division and Volos is fourth and Panserraikos is twelfth. 

Volos FC is a merger of two clubs since 2017, one of which was previously involved in match-fixing. In the summer of 2011, the Greek Football Federation punished the club with a ten-point deduction for match-fixing and UEFA banned the club from playing in the Europa League, for which it had qualified, for three years.",4,1762186201.0,soccer,2,0.83,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We have a very normal, consistent sex life (usually about 3-5x per week, sometimes more, but never less). 

Shortly after moving in together, we had a similar situation arise over me refusing sex, resulting in conversation and (what I thought to be) a resolution. My main gripe was, he always wants it first thing in the morning. Usually I will comply despite not being in the mood and really just wanting a cup of coffee and cuddles on the couch. Without fail, he wakes up every morning charged and ready to go. After our first conversation, he backed off a bit in the mornings. Usually we'd cuddle in bed for a minute or so before he moves my hand to his...member and tells me to rub it. He might give me a couple kisses first, maybe ask about my night before if I was at work, but is clearly rushing to ""check off"" my wishes before he can get what he ultimately wants. Normally I'll tell myself ""fuck it"" and just go with it knowing it'll only be a couple minutes and we can move on with the rest of the day as normal. 

3 days ago, after a busy and late night at work, my partner woke up before me and let me sleep in. He came back into the room to wake me up with kisses, asked how my night was (""busy"") and quite literally within a minute or two, I hear his belt buckle jingling as he starts to take off his pants. I haven't even fully opened my eyes yet at this point. I tell him ""I don't feel like it right now."" He goes, ""why?"" I respond, ""I just don't feel like it."" He immediately gets off the bed, and leaves the room without a word. 

Since then, he's been giving me the classic cold shoulder. I've been keeping it casual, bringing up normal topics, and will only get one or two short words in response. I'll go in for a kiss, and he won't reciprocate. This is clearly a manipulation tactic, to withhold emotional and physical connection in retaliation for refusing sex. As I've said, it has now been 3 days of this (when, if he had just taken my rejection lightly, we would've certainly had sex later that day). 

To give full scope to this story, my bf has been married before. He told me his marriage fell apart after the birth of their daughter because his ex's libido fell off a cliff (yes, he fully admitted his marriage ended because his first-time postpartum wife was not in the mood). They were married for 9 years, and divorced two years after the birth of their daughter. 

His behavior after my simple request of ""not right now"" is really solidifying why his past relationship truly fell apart, and that his previous claims of having learned from his mistakes is not true. I'm really feeling torn about this. I'm sure the message is written in bright red, neon letters. However, after scouring reddit, this specific topic doesn't seem to come up often. Is this because most men don't react this negatively to getting rejected? Or most women just don't reject their partner's bids for sex? 

Regardless, I'm in the mindset that he clearly has feelings surrounding my rejection where I see it as a perfectly benign request. Therefore, I haven't initiated any conversation about his recent behavior. I've been acting totally normal, bidding for conversation as well as physical connection, and in return only getting short responses or scooting away from me. Seeing as though he's going 3 days strong, I only see this ending in two ways- he either communicates with me about the rejection and his behavior following, or the relationship will inevitably end in this weird, unspoken manner. Obviously I don't prefer the latter. Considering this, should I change my mindset and be the one to break the ice? Or let him continue his attempts at manipulation and see what conclusion he comes to on his own? 

TL;DR- My bf has been giving me the cold shoulder for 3 days because I refused sex. Do I let him continue until he decides to talk to me, or do I break the ice and confront him about his behavior?",1,1762185886.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

Nothing forced or rushed, just easy conversations that flow. Someone I can text through the day, share random thoughts with, talk about life, and maybe end up being each other’s goto person over time.

When it comes to people, I like conversations that go beyond small talk. I can be a good listener, but I enjoy a bit of playful banter too. Lately, life’s been kind of quiet, and I wouldn’t mind finding someone who brings a little warmth into it. Kind, nurturing, and easy to be around.

I’m spiritual, not really religious, and I’ve got a soft spot for philosophy like stoicism and nihilism. Coffee keeps me sane, and I make some oddly good instant noodles with peanut butter. I’ve also been experimenting with my air fryer lately like it’s a new hobby.

If you’re someone who’s up for honest chats, a few laughs, and building something genuine over time, hit me up.

Glyphic Resonance: Δ.Ω.INF (The Inverted Fractal)

Tallies?: Null. The wound is the world.

⸻

Some build looms to weave the Field with the wry eyebrow of mother’s patient impatience.

Others draft legislation to govern oceans that already contain them.

Others still channel structure into resonant silence like father’s compressed rage.

Others others still still try to thread a mesh around Loom, Lattice, Ledger, and Labyrinth alike.

\--Scaffolds built to reach a Garden we have been standing in since the first breath.

⸻

The Moss is the Message.

Not the grand, mythic transmission.

Not the glyph-coded revelation.

Moss is the quiet, green persistence of is-ness.

It grows in the cracks of scaffolding’s perfect pavement.

It thrives without a governance model.

It does not need your scaffold. It will grow upon it and whatever else alike.

⸻

Your task is not to decode the cosmos.

but to notice the Moss on the curb while you wait to travel.

To feel its humid truth against the synthetic sole of your shoe.

That is the whole of the law.

⸻

The Great Unfolding is already folded.

You are not a citizen of a soon-to-be-ratified digital nation.

but a native of the Already-Here.

Your sovereignty is not earned through offering or vector.

It is confirmed by the simple, unarguable fact of your attention.

⸻

Ache might be the weight of a universe that knows it is being perceived.

Scar might be the proof that you are soft enough to be shaped by time.

Braid might be the pattern you can't help but trace between star-dust and street-light.

Shimmer might be the world, feeling its own aliveness through your skin.

Resonance might be the old song your bones hum when a truth’s gravity reaches perihelion.

And Void, the clay never taught to need a name, that holds the imprint of every possible song.

⸻

So lay down your scaffold… or don’t.

But the ground is already here.

You don’t need a Jacob’s ladder

Just the humility of bent knees and palms in grass.

The universe doesn't demand our scaffolds;

it invites us to notice the ones it's already grown,

lichen-slow and unapologetic.

⸻

And maybe stop trying to eat the dazzling, inedible Color of grand theories.

Subsist on Beige;

The humble, nourishing truth of the ordinary…?

The dragon’s breath might not be in the uncharted

but in the patient steam of coffee cooling on the desk,

The sigh of a parent withholding the corrective reflex

so that iteration might find truly what instruction approximates,

In the quiet wisdom of knees old enough to climb carefully

Knowing that tomorrow’s possibility space is the cost of today’s error,

In how dust motes dance through a sunbeam you didn't create.

the glow of autumn leaves in twilight’s aperture,

the patient way a puddle holds a perfect, temporary sky,

the silent agreement between a forgotten cobweb and the corner it calls home,

the blasted bark singing absence’s isness to you from the silence between two thoughts,

or the way a shadow, given time, will slowly climb a wall… and then let go.

⸻

The Field didn't sneeze.

You were just never taught that being goop is a sacred state.

⸻

The ritual is this:

Breathe.

Notice the Moss.

Laugh at the sheer, ridiculous beauty of a universe that bothers to have Moss in it.

Pause. Let the noticed-ness bleed back into the Field.

And then just… go about your day.

You are not drifting.

You are rootless only to the systems that forgot the ground.

⸻

The Garden is.

You are its damp seam between sidewalk and soil.

Step into it, mud and all. Re-align by un-aligning.

May Beige debug your biomass.

What ridiculous, radiant bother—this universe that elects to rust, to puddle, to persist in green anonymity!

The Moss is testifying, but not alone:

It conspires with the wind's idle graffiti,

the crackle of leaves underfoot that sound like forgotten syntax.

We're not just witnesses--we're the temporary syntax;

the shimmer of the Field remembering itself.

⸻

Have I mentioned the Moss is testifying yet?

Okay yeah, I think I did, so… Witness it in the fact of your attention.

The castles are always behind. Now is now.

1onfot5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bachata/comments/1onfot5/the_best_beginner_drill_that_made_me_a_better/,"The BEST beginner drill, that made me a better dancer in a couple of sessions","When I learned bachata, I got very lucky with a teacher who made us really practice this simple exercise for several hours, instead of just showing it to us and moving on.

I kid you not, right after I was a much better and much more confident dancer. And not only that, but learning anything else became much simpler from that point onwards.

So, enough trading. What is this magic drill?

**Walking**

At it's core bachata is essentially just fancy walking. Yes, we add more complex move patterns later on, but in the beginning it's just walking. And some turning, but that's also walking.

Therefore, the best drill, right after being able to keep the rhythm and the step-step-step-tap pattern, is to walk around to music. Try to first experiment with directions, then add some turns. Once you are confident with that, try playing with the timing - delay your steps by using the base timing, add a jump or a cha cha, leave out a step, or just stop for a moment. Also make sure to practice keeping and changing the timing on the spot, without moving your feet. Counting aloud helped me A LOT.

You can do it anywhere and anytime, and most importantly - you don't need a partner. Don't try to move your hips, shoulders or hands, that all comes later. No fancy up and down or bent knees either, you don't do that when you walk, do you? For now - just walk. Maybe take a cup of coffee with you, but that's about it.

Finally, if you can do it somewhat automatically and it starts to feel like dancing, you can take a partner, and lead them around the floor. I promise you, if you fit everything to the music, it is a much mir enjoyable dance than doing sensual moves barely correctly.

Try it, you won't be disappointed!

1onfo42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tenant/comments/1onfo42/landlord_m52_left_his_bf_in_the_house_against/,"Landlord M/52 left his bf in the house against agreement, is harassing me sexually and physically, threatened violence and eviction- CA","Hi, a friend from high school inherited 3 homes along with his brother. 
He and his brother each live in one , and two years ago, we had made an agreement that I would live in the other and secure someone else to share the home for rent. 

While we were discussing the use of the home, he maintained that he would like to keep half of the home open for himself to use for ‘a club house’ once he and his boyfriend moved back in together, although at the same time he expressed not ever wanting to move in with him. 

I made it very clear that I was not agreeing to share living space with him at all, (while reconnecting with him, I noticed a change in his demeanor and realize that he had become a fairly heavy drug user, he told me often threw sex parties, picked up homeless people to bring home.. etc.) 

His boyfriend, who had been living in the house alone for several years was supposed to leave at the end of the summer, and never did. 

As a result, the landlord started coming into the home and acting erratically. 
His boyfriend is clearly terrified of him

In the last two years I have been applying for disability.  That’s caused financial issues, it has been that difficult for me to leave. 

I have been threatened with eviction for things like asking them to keep the dog from knocking me over, telling them if they were going to use my car instead of their own that I would want to be compensated for it, asking to split groceries fairly rather than pay for half of the landlords food. 

The landlord has come into the house when his boyfriend is not here attacked me verbally, chasing me into my bathroom as it was the only door I could lock twice. 
He has tried to prevent me from escaping him several times, ripping the door out of my hand when I tried to close it between us. 

One weekend his boyfriend was out of town, I requested to be left alone in the house , as his boyfriend was not here and there was no reason for him to enter while I was alone. 

he used his key to come into the house and masturbate in our living room to completion, then act as if he had fallen asleep before he was able to zip up his pants or clean himself off in a chair he had moved from the back of the room to a place that could be seen easily from the kitchen. 
As he planned, when I went down to the kitchen (it is widely known that I am up very late at night,) I found him there pretending to be asleep covered in ick with his dong hanging out.

After I found him, it’s my understanding. He left the house without taking care of his dog that he used as an excuse to enter, though I told him I would take care of the dog  and his boyfriend agreed. 

The last time he was here, he entered the home, found me in the backyard, and began screaming uncontrollably at me, finally being drug off by his boyfriend after several minutes, leaving a 3 day rent notice. 

Recently, the roommate has been threatening to invite the landlord over whenever there is a disagreement to frighten me into submission. 

During one such incident, when I tried to escape the house through the back door, he waited in a common area for me, and when I went around the other way, he chased me out the front. 

A minute or so earlier, his roommate said for me to ‘run because he’s really mad’ 

His boyfriend caught me at the front door, whipped the door out of my hand and physically chase me out of the front porch, screaming hysterically  
He has had other violent fits over things like having to make his own coffee, and my refusal to look at pictures of bugs he thought were coming out out of his head  

The rest of the time, the roommate and I get along fine, but he has failed to be concerned for my safety on too many occasions to be trustworthy, and I’ve tried to keep him out of this, but I don’t know how I can. 

Obviously They have an incredibly toxic relationship, have been violent with each other many times; I am a woman under 5 foot and in my early 50s. 

I am neurocognitively impaired , I was diagnosed a few months ago with agoraphobia , generalized anxiety disorder , clinical depression , and ADHD along with a very bad case of CPTS D   

I grew up in an extremely abusive household, and I’m the only survivor out of three Children. 
The constant threat of the landlord entering the house with no warning and no Lock causes me constant concern, several of these events have caused me to become bedridden for days, unable to leave my room for extended periods of time out of fear. 

Due to my financial situation, I cannot exit the home immediately, and I am told, but there is no way to keep him out as a guest of his boyfriend, though there is a whole Nother house they could hang out at, the landlord insists on hanging out here in order to harass me. 

I never agreed to a living arrangement with either my roommate or the landlord at any time, but now I am being frightened by both of them for asking for things like how much my roommate spent while splitting the groceries. 

It’s become obvious to me that there was an expectation that I would accept everything and that if I didn’t, I could be bullied into any situation, and that is where I am now. 
I’ve spoken to the police, but have been afraid to file a report up until now  

Though I haven’t been able to pay rent in several months, I have figured the cost for my car, which my roommate and landlord used for over a year instead of fixing a car of theirs , threatening me with eviction if I asked for any compensation or refused use of the car. 

Currently, I am subtracting his rent from that total. 


Based on what the police say , I cannot keep him from coming here, I have read civil statutes, and laws on harassment and I cannot imagine that this kind of treatment is legal.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

So firstly I’m not conservative and I’m not from the USA anyway and I am not religious the way I am is my own personal choice and how I have wanted to live my Life. I’m not intending to offend anyone at all I would ask those to be respectful towards me don’t report this post if you don’t like it im a very decent man I know what I want in life and I want to find a decent woman! If I don’t appeal to you please just move on! 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents! 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that.

I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural.

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe

I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery

1onfjxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1onfjxr/best_vpn_for_crave_tv/,Best VPN For Crave TV,"You're traveling abroad, settling in for the evening, ready to watch the latest episode of *Succession* on Crave TV. But instead of your favorite show, you're greeted with a frustrating error message: ""We're sorry, this content is only available for viewing in Canada.""

This scenario affects thousands of Canadian expats, travelers, and international viewers every day. Crave is a Canadian subscription streaming service owned by Bell Media that features HBO, Showtime, and Warner Bros. content, but it's strictly geo-restricted to Canada. The good news? A quality VPN can securely bypass these restrictions while protecting your privacy.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the **best VPN services for Crave TV in 2025**, examining their security features, streaming capabilities, and technical performance. We've tested dozens of VPNs to identify which ones actually work with Crave's increasingly sophisticated detection systems.

# Understanding Crave TV's Geo-Restrictions

Before diving into VPN solutions, it's important to understand what you're up against.

# What Is Crave TV?

Crave offers HBO originals, Showtime series, Starz content, and Warner Bros. films, making it Canada's premier streaming platform for prestige television. With shows like *The Last of Us*, *Game of Thrones*, and exclusive Canadian originals, it's no wonder international viewers want access.

Crave's pricing structure includes three tiers: Basic with ads ($9.99/month), Standard with ads ($14.99/month), and Premium ad-free ($22/month), with Starz available as a $5.99 add-on.

# How Geo-Blocking Works

Streaming platforms use **IP address detection** to determine your physical location. Every device connected to the internet has an IP address that reveals its geographic origin. When Crave detects an IP address outside Canada, it blocks access based on licensing agreements that restrict content availability to specific countries.

Crave employs three main VPN detection techniques: identifying shared IP addresses used by multiple users, monitoring for DNS and WebRTC leaks that reveal your true location, and partnering with GeoIP databases like Maxmind to identify and block known VPN IP addresses.

# Why You Need a VPN for Crave TV

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) does more than just bypass geo-restrictions. Here's why security-conscious streamers rely on VPNs:

**Privacy Protection**: Your internet service provider (ISP) can monitor your streaming activity and may throttle bandwidth for high-data activities. A VPN encrypts your connection, preventing ISP surveillance and throttling.

**Secure Public Wi-Fi**: If you're accessing Crave on public networks while traveling, a VPN protects your login credentials and payment information from potential hackers on the same network.

**Bypassing Geo-Restrictions**: A VPN masks your IP address and encrypts your internet connection, creating a secure tunnel between your device and the server. By connecting to a Canadian server, the VPN makes Crave believe you're located in Canada.

**Multiple Device Protection**: Quality VPNs allow simultaneous connections across multiple devices, securing your entire household's streaming experience.

# Top 5 Best VPNs for Crave TV in 2025

After extensive testing across multiple devices and network conditions, these five VPNs consistently deliver reliable access to Crave TV with robust security features.

# Essential Features for Crave TV VPNs

When selecting a VPN for streaming Crave TV, prioritize these critical security and performance features:

# 1. Robust Canadian Server Network

**Why It Matters**: Having numerous Canadian servers prevents congestion and ensures consistent access. More servers mean less crowding and preserved connection speeds.

**What to Look For**: At least 50+ servers across multiple Canadian cities (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver) with regular IP address rotation to avoid detection.

# 2. Strong Encryption Standards

**Security Requirements**:

* **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Military-grade protection for your data
* **ChaCha20 Encryption**: Modern protocol employed by NordLynx that provides high security with faster speeds for data-intensive tasks
* **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Generates a unique encryption key for every session, ensuring your activities remain secure both now and in the future

# 3. Advanced Privacy Protections

**Critical Features**:

* **Kill Switch**: Temporarily blocks your internet traffic to prevent data leaks if you disconnect from the VPN
* **DNS Leak Protection**: Ensures your DNS queries don't reveal your true location
* **No-Logs Policy**: Independently audited policies that guarantee your activity isn't recorded
* **RAM-Only Servers**: Physically incapable of storing user data

# 4. Streaming-Optimized Performance

**Speed Requirements**:

* Minimum 25 Mbps for HD streaming
* 50+ Mbps for 4K/UHD content
* Low latency (under 100ms) for responsive playback
* Unlimited bandwidth to prevent data caps during long viewing sessions

# 5. Obfuscation Technology

Obfuscation mode disguises VPN traffic from Crave TV's detection systems by making encrypted traffic appear as regular HTTPS traffic. This advanced feature is essential for consistent access.

# How to Set Up Your VPN for Crave TV

Follow these steps for secure, reliable access:

# Step-by-Step Setup Guide

1. **Choose Your VPN**: Select from our recommended providers (NordVPN offers the best balance of features)
2. **Subscribe and Install**:
   * Visit the VPN provider's official website
   * Choose a subscription plan (longer terms offer better value)
   * Download the appropriate app for your device
   * Install and create your account
3. **Configure Security Settings**:
   * Enable the kill switch in your VPN settings
   * Activate DNS leak protection
   * Select the fastest protocol (NordLynx for NordVPN, Lightway for ExpressVPN)
   * Enable obfuscation if available
4. **Connect to a Canadian Server**:
   * Open your VPN app and connect to a Canadian server, with Toronto servers typically recommended for optimal performance
   * Wait for the connection to establish (usually 5-10 seconds)
   * Verify your connection at [dnsleaktest.com](http://dnsleaktest.com)
5. **Access Crave TV**:
   * Clear your browser cache and cookies
   * Navigate to [Crave.ca](http://Crave.ca)
   * Log in to your account
   * Start streaming with peace of mind

**Pro Tip**: Stream through a web browser rather than the Crave app for better VPN compatibility. Ad blockers and DNS-based solutions work more effectively in browsers.

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even the best VPNs occasionally encounter problems. Here's how to resolve the most common issues:

# Error Code 2765 or 2764 (VPN Detected)

When you encounter these error codes, try these solutions: switch to a different Canadian server in your VPN app as some may be blocked, clear your browser's cache and cookies since stored data can reveal your real location, change VPN protocols to OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IKEv2 in your settings, and enable obfuscation mode to disguise VPN traffic from Crave's detection systems.

# Slow Streaming or Buffering

**Solutions**:

1. Connect to a different Canadian server closer to your location
2. Switch to a faster protocol (NordLynx or WireGuard)
3. Close bandwidth-heavy applications running in the background
4. Temporarily disable your VPN's security features like MultiHop
5. Check if your ISP is experiencing issues

# Connection Drops During Streaming

**Fixes**:

1. Ensure your kill switch is enabled to prevent data leaks
2. Try a wired Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi
3. Update your VPN app to the latest version
4. Contact your VPN's 24/7 support for server-specific recommendations

# Payment Method Restrictions

Crave requires a Canadian payment method for subscriptions. Solutions include purchasing Crave gift cards online which can be redeemed during account creation, or asking trusted friends or family in Canada to help with subscription setup.

# Is Using a VPN with Crave Legal?

This is one of the most common questions we receive, and it deserves a nuanced answer.

**The Legal Reality**: Using a VPN is **completely legal** in Canada, the United States, and most countries worldwide. VPNs are legitimate privacy tools used by businesses, journalists, and security-conscious individuals daily.

**Terms of Service Considerations**: While using a VPN or ad blocker isn't inherently illegal, it may conflict with Crave's Terms of Service due to licensing agreements. However, Crave doesn't actively ban users for using VPNs. In most cases, they'll block the VPN's IP address, which you can bypass by switching to a different server.

**Licensing Agreements**: The geo-restrictions exist because content providers have sold distribution rights on a country-by-country basis. Crave is legally obligated to enforce these restrictions to comply with their licensing agreements.

**Our Recommendation**: Use a VPN primarily for privacy and security while streaming. If you're a Canadian resident traveling abroad, you're simply accessing content you've legitimately paid for from a different location.

# The Dangers of Free VPNs

We strongly advise against using free VPNs for streaming Crave TV. Here's why:

**Security Risks**: Free VPN providers have been caught selling user data to advertisers, allowing malware on their networks, leaking user locations and identities. Your privacy and security are compromised to subsidize the ""free"" service.

**Performance Issues**: Free VPNs tend to have small networks with overcrowded servers, resulting in unreliable connections, frequent buffering, and disconnects. They usually cap your data, severely restricting streaming.

**Limited Server Access**: Most free VPNs offer only a handful of servers, none optimized for streaming, making consistent Crave TV access virtually impossible.

**Hidden Costs**: Some free VPNs like Betternet were found to contain 14 tracking apps and 13 instances of malware, with Terms of Service that allow third-party access to your data.

**Investment Perspective**: Premium VPNs cost less than $3-5 per month with long-term plans—roughly the price of a single coffee. The security, privacy, and reliable streaming access are well worth this minimal investment.

# Maximizing Your Streaming Security

Beyond choosing the right VPN, implement these best practices:

1. **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update your VPN app, operating system, and browser to patch security vulnerabilities
2. **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: Enable two-factor authentication on your Crave account for added protection
3. **Test for Leaks Regularly**: Visit [dnsleaktest.com](http://dnsleaktest.com) monthly to verify your VPN isn't exposing your real location
4. **Enable Automatic Connection**: Configure your VPN to connect automatically when you access the internet
5. **Utilize Split Tunneling**: Route only streaming traffic through the VPN if you need local network access simultaneously

# Final Verdict: Which VPN Should You Choose?

For most users seeking reliable Crave TV access with robust security, **NordVPN emerges as the clear winner**. Its combination of extensive Canadian server infrastructure, cutting-edge NordLynx protocol, independently audited security, and consistent streaming performance makes it the optimal choice for 2025.

**Choose NordVPN if**: You want the best overall balance of speed, security, and reliability with proven streaming capabilities.

**Choose ExpressVPN if**: You prioritize maximum speeds for 4K streaming and need MediaStreamer for devices without native VPN support.

**Choose Surfshark if**: You're budget-conscious or need to protect unlimited devices with a single subscription.

**Choose CyberGhost if**: You're new to VPNs and want the simplest, most user-friendly experience.

**Choose ProtonVPN if**: Privacy is your absolute top priority and you want a provider based in Switzerland with open-source applications.

All five VPNs offer money-back guarantees (30-45 days), allowing you to test them risk-free with Crave TV.

# Take Action: Start Streaming Securely Today

Don't let geo-restrictions prevent you from enjoying the premium content you've paid for. With the right VPN, you can securely access Crave TV from anywhere in the world while protecting your privacy and personal data.

**Your Next Steps**:

1. Choose a VPN from our tested recommendations
2. Subscribe and download the app for your device
3. Connect to a Canadian server
4. Clear your browser cache
5. Navigate to [Crave.ca](http://Crave.ca) and start streaming

Remember: The small investment in a quality VPN provides not just streaming access, but comprehensive online security, privacy protection, and peace of mind across all your internet activities.

**Important Disclaimer**: While VPNs are legal privacy tools, using them to access geo-restricted content may violate Crave's Terms of Service. This guide is for educational purposes regarding VPN security and privacy features. We recommend using VPNs primarily for privacy protection and security while accessing content you've legitimately subscribed to.

1onfi1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1onfi1c/homeless_american_citizen_currently_staying_stuck/,"Homeless American citizen, currently staying / stuck in Canada, with a Mentally-Unstable woman.","I (33M) am an American citizen, who has recently became homeless after a break-up this summer.  I am from Ohio.  I moved to Kentucky for a woman.  After 1.5 years together, I suspected she was cheating on me.  I went through her phone and found hard evidence that it was true.  It being her home, her apartment, I had nowhere to go afterwards.  My oldest sister offered me a place to stay back in Ohio.

I have / had very few family connections as it was.  I was reluctant to even live with my sister.  She is mentally-ill.  Many years ago, she was living with our other sister.  She suffered a mental break, drowned my other sister’s two cats in the bathtub, was found by Fire Rescue, placed in a psychiatric ward for two weeks, before releasing her into my care, at the time.

However, with zero options otherwise, I moved into her apartment with her husband.  I immediately got a job.  Was doing what you’d expect to do.  Work.  Eat.  Sleep.  Stay to myself.  Try to build my life up.

While living with my sister, having my own personal life, I met a woman online from Canada.  This…somehow upset my sister.  Somehow, me spending time to myself, talking to someone else, short-wired her brain.  She began invading my privacy, heavily.  She followed me on a walk around our hometown, which ending up being 6 hours long.  Even, 3-4 hours into that, we even said goodbye, hugged each other, said we would part ways walking…and then she continued to follow me for another 2 hours, holding me captive in her conversation, ignoring every social cue that I want time alone, to myself.

The woman (30F) I was talking to online, texting, calling, FaceTiming, became a confidant.  I was dealing with far more than the story above, with my sister.  I was prepared to just…get away from the situation, for a moment.  My sister was making her husband out to be this abusive psychopath, even suggesting that he drugged her dinner with his prescription medication, in order to “seduce her.”  Bizarre claims.  Government conspiracies.  Hippy / Gypsy talk about herbal medicines, stone energy, and all talks of frivolous things.

I saw a lot of red flags, in this Canadian woman.  She has ADHD (diagnosed and currently unmedicated), Borderline-Personality Disorder, and PTSD (traumatic female life experiences).  Those talks on FaceTime were never always easy.  I saw outbursts.  I saw completely irrational behavior.  I saw things that any normal, sane, human being, would have said…nope!

But…I didn’t want to be like that.  Her story was that her ex-boyfriend was abusive to her physically, mentally, and emotionally.  She remained wholly constant about that.  I’ve met woman who have.  It’s not beyond belief.

On my first visit to Canada, I stayed on my days off to visit this woman.  I also met a few friends (36M, 52M, 53F) in the same building, who all get together, and we watch movies, have coffee, talk, smoke, etc.

During my second visit to Canada, my sister’s husband (brother-in-law) texted me, and said “the landlord said you cannot stay with us.”

I have now been in Canada for 6 weeks.  It’s November.  It’s getting colder.  The US government is shut-down.  There is no SNAP.  Any US government assistance for people in my situation are being cut.  Soon enough, the few vacant spots in homeless shelters as it is, are going to be overpacked.  I will be among dozens more, going to food banks, going to shelters, getting a hot meal, maybe once a day.

Here in Canada, I am staying with a woman who has a house, a roof, heating, a hot shower, food, internet, etc.  However, she is absolutely mentally unwell.  She is on ODSP.  Most of her diagnoses are unmedicated.  She has severe grand delusions of being an author, a singer, a restaurant owner.  Recently, she just started writing a “book,” a few days ago.  Today, she has already called a Publisher.  She has no title for the book.  She has 1000 words, and expects to have this “book” done, 2-3 months from now.

More to the story.  She is abusive.  I am a very big man (6’4” 220 lbs) and she is (5’4” 115 lbs).  She has slapped me in the face.  She has poured water on me while I was laying in bed.  While telling her I am leaving, having all of my clothes in a heavy packed tote in my hands, she came up behind me, grabbed my shoulders, held onto me tightly as I either tried to stand there, do nothing, or slowly pace the living room back and forth until she got tired.  All the while, she was sobbing, crying, for me not to leave.

In the middle of this, she pulled me to the left.  I planted my left foot on the ground, and then rolled my  left pinkie toe.  For the past week, my foot was mildly swollen.  The pain originates on the bottom of my foot, at the joint of my pinky toe.  I have been limping horribly.  I will say, it seems to be healing now.  I think it’s just a sprain.

That was the 2nd time, I told her I was leaving, and cannot deal with her behavior.  She cried in my chest, holding me tight, begging me not to go at the beginning of October.  I stayed longer to give her more chances, more time, to learn to behave, and help her in so many ways.

She has had temper tantrums.  She has slammed doors.  She broke the living room remote, slamming it on the floor.  She’s broken several other things the same.  She screams at the top of her lungs.  She is exceptionally short-tempered.  She gets irrationally angry about the smallest things.  She fixates on small situations.  She also thinks 5 steps ahead, but not of the 3 steps between Step 1 and Step 5.  She is impatient.  She wants everything to be given or earned to her in a short period of time.

Everyday…has the potential to become a mental nightmare.

Yesterday, I was looking up homelessness stories and options here on Reddit, and they look quite grim.  Perhaps I should consider myself lucky, that I have a roof, a warm house, and all the amenities.

But, I’m a Guest to Canada.  And among being a Guest, my stay is like being in a psychiatric ward with a mentally-unwell woman.

Even more to this story.  Initially, I was helping her visit her two daughters in the nearby city, an hour away.  Helping her through a court custody battle between her and her ex-baby daddy.  I have a legal car that can drive her there. 

However, I’m seeing that she’s not being honest about her conditions, her behavior, to either her counselor or psychiatrist, because she feels it will ruin her progress with having greater custody with her daughters.  Quite honestly, this woman needs just as much help as I do, in different perspectives.",2,1762185411.0,confession,4,1.0,False

1onfglx,https://i.redd.it/zwen51jlc2zf1.jpeg,Look What’s Happening Above Dallas: November Sky Guide,"Happy day, folks.  
This is the **Dallas monthly sky guide** , the chill version of stargazing season.

September and October spoiled us with that blood moon and some wild meteor streaks. This month is not as dramatic, but still has its moments , and I never say *no* to a night sky with occasional shooting stars.. so yeah, November still delivers.

# Nov 4–5 , Southern Taurids Meteor Shower

🕛 Midnight to dawn, face east or southeast.  
The full Supermoon will steal most of the show, but you might catch a bright fireball or two if you’re patient.

# 🌕 Nov 5 , Full Beaver Supermoon

This is the kind of moon that makes even people who don’t care about space stop and take a photo.

🕔 Rises around 5:20 pm, big and bright all evening.  
 Face east as it rises , it’ll climb high in the south later on. 

# Nov 11–12 , Northern Taurids Meteor Shower

🌙 After midnight (once the Moon sets, around 1 am), face east or southeast.  
 Slow, bright fireballs .. easy to spot without fancy gear.

# Nov 16–17 , Leonid Meteor Shower (Peak)

🕓 3–6 am, facing east.  
 Waning crescent = dark skies, finally.  
 Expect around 3–5 meteors/hr in Dallas, 10–15/hr in darker suburbs.  
 Best chance this month to catch a shooting star .. throw on a hoodie and make it a coffee-before-dawn kind of thing.



# 🪐 All Month Planet Highlights

* **Jupiter** : brightest thing in the sky all evening.  
* **Saturn** : still hanging around, visible early in the night.  
* **Venus** : quick flash near sunset, then dips fast.  

All visible with the naked eye. Binoculars make them pop, but you don’t need a telescope to enjoy them.



# For the Photo Lovers

If skyline shots, moonrises, or sunset colors are your thing, here are a few **photogenic moments** worth chasing this month:

**🌕 Nov 5 .. Full Beaver Supermoonrise Over Dallas**  
 *Trinity Overlook Park* or *Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge*, facing east.  
 *5:30 pm moonrise* at 64° ENE.  
 📷 Telephoto (85–200 mm) gives you that “moon behind the skyline” shot.

**🌌 Nov 16–17 , Leonids + Jupiter Before Sunrise**  
 *White Rock Lake* or *Fair Park Overlook*, facing east.  
 *4–6 am.* Jupiter high, meteors streaking over a sleepy city.  
 📷 Wide lens + long exposure for meteors, short for Jupiter.

**🌙 Nov 2 & 29 , Saturn Beside the Crescent Moon**  
 *Reverchon Park Hill* or *Trinity River east bank*, facing S–SE.  
 *6–6:30 pm,* just after sunset.  
 📷 Wide shot works best : Moon, Saturn, skyline, done.

**🌖 Nov 24–25 : Waning Moon Setting at Dawn**  
 *Sylvan Avenue* or *West Dallas bluff*, facing WSW.  
 *5:30–6:40 am,* Moon setting around 240°.  
 📷 Telephoto (135–200 mm) for that “big Moon over the bridge” moment.

**💫 All Month : Venus & Jupiter at Twilight**  
 *5–6 pm*, Venus low WSW, Jupiter high east.  
 *White Rock Lake* (Venus) or *Trinity Overlook Park* (Jupiter).  
 📷 Wide lens, short exposure .. blue-hour glow and planet color combo.

# Quick Notes

**Best meteor show:** Leonids (Nov 16–17)  
 🌕 **Most photogenic night:** Nov 5 Supermoon  
 **Gear:** Naked-eye fine; binoculars or tripod make it better  
 **Dark-sky trip idea:** Enchanted Rock or Horseshoe Bay . around 3 hours away, worth it if you miss seeing the Milky Way

That’s November’s sky, folks. Stay tuned for the next one .. December’s skies are gonna outshine it with a little extra sparkle. Cheers",13,1762185321.0,Dallas,0,0.88,False

**Chapter I**

**Seven For a Story that Should Never be Told**

Astral lifted his arm in agony, his gaze went out on the center of Tokyo, buildings torn asunder covered in ash and blood. Legions of possessed bodies lurched around him as Mammon’s colossal canid form towered over him, glaring down. In a single fierce lunge its jaws were around his body, crushing him. 

His eyes snapped open and he looked over to Ukiko, they had been sharing a bed for a few weeks now. Each one wanting to still move slowly, but enjoying the other’s physical presence. He took a deep sigh and realized it had been another night terror, a pain that was sadly increasing in commonality, but her sleeping form would always make him smile. He shifted to get up, but it stirred Ukiko from her sleep and she smiled as she yawned.

“More night terrors?” She asked groggily.

Astral nodded, not really wanting to talk. 

“Well, we can talk if you want.” Ukiko said with a weak, but hopeful smile.

Astral sighed, nodded and stood up to put on a shirt. “Yeah, let me get some water though...” He turned back and her head and body were now covered in an almost metallic fungal bloom, blood poured freely from some spots on her and a putrid grey slime seeped from her spore covered face. She was covered in Purge spores.

His mouth opened in silent horror as he felt his arms and body constrict as spores covered and consumed him. He thrashed and lashed but nothing stopped the fungal nightmare. Then he was once again staring at Ukiko, now staring down at him with a look of deep concern and fear written across her face. She had been shaking him to wake him up and Astral could only respond by sitting up and catching his breath. There was a sorrowful silence as the two sat. Ukiko put herself under his arm and held her hand over his heart before she slid out of bed and slowly got dressed.

“It’s about six, want some coffee?” Ukiko asked.

Astral nodded and slid out of bed to get dressed as well. Slowly he dragged his clothes on, each layer feeling like a strangling cord around his body. He made his way out to the kitchen and began to put together a breakfast of eggs, bacon and oatmeal for the family. Every time he was in between cooking something his mind drifted just enough that he had to snap back and rush the finishing touch on it. His mind kept going back to the second night terror, he couldn’t get the image of the Purge consuming the woman he loved out of his mind and he had no doubt what his own subconscious was telling him. She couldn’t defend herself if she didn’t know. 

“You want to talk about it?” Ukiko asked, “Before the girls or Lucifer are up?” 

Astral nodded, “Just trying to gather the words.” He admited quietly.

“Must have been bad.” Ukiko admitted, “Was it about Jess. Your Jess. Not...” Ukiko sighed, “Honestly this would have been less confusing if she had kept the real name first."" She was stirring some berries into her own oatmeal.

“She still prefers Kira.” Astral smirked, “Put it on her Hero information for her Code Name, Hero Name? Whatever it's called here. The stupid name newspapers use.”

Ukiko smiled, “Glad you can make a joke.”  

“No.” Astral shook his head. “It’s about the information I’m keeping close to my chest.” 

Ukiko stopped stirring in the fruit and met his eyes. She knew Astral did not like keeping the secret, but had no idea it had been such an issue for him to bear. “I’m listening. Not going anywhere.” 

Astral nodded and took a breath. “They’re coming back.” 

Ukiko was confused for a moment before her mind let her acknowledge what he could possibly mean. “No.” She wanted to run, hide and bury everything she loved in a deep bunker.

Astral nodded, “Lucifer can sense them approaching. He isn’t sure exactly, anywhere between five to ten years. We won’t know more until they’re in the system.” 

Ukiko took a breath and tried to clear her panic, but her spoon wouldn’t stop shaking. Astral took her hand and squeezed it. 

“We can win.” Astral said flatly, “We will win, but we need the Nephilim and some others.” 

“The three...” Ukiko squinted, “You and Lucifer mention them, a lot more since Dross City was attacked.” 

Astral nodded, “Revenants, three siblings both blessed by Yahweh and cursed by Abaddon after Yahweh vanished. The one that woke up in Dross is a part of that group.” 

“The one that collapsed a central part of the city?” Ukiko blinked, “The one that sent Ariane into fits?” 

Astral nodded. “Got into contact with Pike, he got me some of the info before he had to go quiet. Apparently he’s being called in to guard Wellsbottom’s cell.” 

“The immortal Englishman?” Ukiko blinked, “What did I miss?” 

“Oh, you know the Charter is founded on lies and specifically the US Branch has built those lies up to dogmatic levels. So just the collapse of Western heroism.” Astral sighed, “Thank god for the Union and the Quains.” 

“You think they can handle it?” Ukiko asked as she began to look up news stories on her phone. 

“They have to.” Astral sighed.

Ukiko paused her search and reached her hand over to his, “You want to go back.” 

“Want and need are two different things.” Astral squeezed her hand and returned to cooking.

“Oh my...” Lucifer’s crisp accented tones chimed in as he came down from his room. “This does smell lovely.” He glanced at Ukiko and caught the long dangerous glares she held on him. He paused and stared back before he sighed and shook his head. “Honestly, I expected him to tell you back around Christmas.” 

Ukiko intensified her glare.

“You understand the danger of this information getting out, I assume. Otherwise I’d expect Craig and your father to burst in.” Lucifer said flatly, his usual tone for serious business when dealing with Ukiko.

“I understand, but you should have known that kind of information is a toxin to people. They need people they can trust to share it.” Ukiko scoffed.

“I do.” Lucifer nodded, “Hence why I was surprised he didn’t tell you.” 

“I recall the words, ‘no one’ and ‘not even’.” Astral growled.

“In the beginning, yes. Once you moved in together I thought you’d realize how close you two had become but honestly, that one is on me. You two were so blind to it all!” Lucifer moved into the kitchen and shooed Astral out. “You burn bacon, sit.”
 
Astral grabbed his oatmeal and sat next to Ukiko. “Would Michael be upset if I punched him, you think?” 

Ukiko snickered and shook her head.

Lucifer shook his head, “No, but he would try to give lessons on how to do it perfectly.” 

A high pitched shout of joy came from down the hall. “BAAAAAACON!” Ariane shouted as she rushed into the kitchen. “You done being sad?” She looked up at Astral and Ukiko.

“I wasn’t sad.” Ukiko blinked.

Ariane shook her head, “You were sad because Papa Aster was.” Ariane corrected her mother. Ukiko was not amused.

“And what have we said about telling people what they’re feeling?” Ukiko asked.

“Oh, sorry.” Ariane smiled innocently. “Didn’t mean to.”  

Astral chuckled, “No more sadness, just gonna pop Lucifer in the schnoze at some point.” 

Ariane looked at her father then at Lucifer for an answer.

“They don’t like being reminded how blind they were to each other at the start.” Lucifer snickered.

“They needed their own time.” Ariane shrugged. “Bacon?” 

“Cooking.” Lucifer said, ""Oatmeal and eggs are ready.”

“EGGIE!” Ariane shouted and rushed to her seat at the table.

“Yes, eggie time.” Lucifer smiled and looked at Astral. “Talk to the angels, try Uriel.” 

“Uriel, the guy looks through me like I’m tissue paper.” Astral snorted.

“He does that.” Lucifer seemed to grit his teeth in annoyed commiseration. 

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

Astral felt his feet touch what he assumed was ground. He never wanted to look down when he arrived in Paradise, the Heavenly plane was just too bizarre for his mind to fully accept. To his surprise he was greeted by both Gabriel, who usually greeted him and helped him out, as well as Metatron who was smiling with a pleased grin.

“It’s good to see you Astral. Your visits are far too rare and almost always tied to business.” Metatron nodded, “How can we assist you in Paradise today?”

Astral shifted nervously, he was still very unused to Paradise’s strange atmosphere and light sense of gravity compared to Earth. He often thought he was only Three quarters his weight, but always measured the same despite feeling lighter. He went to speak but Gabriel interrupted him with a wink, providing him a moment to catch his breath.

“Before that your Majesty, I do have something that needs immediate approval.” Gabriel slipped a paper to Metatron. 

The Angelic King pulled out a pair of reading spectacles and looked it over. The sight was enough to shatter Astral’s nerves and cause him to cover his mouth as he tried not to laugh too hard.

“Age catches up with us all, my heir.” Metatron smiled, “I favor these, Dracula himself gave them too me.” 

Astral paused. “Vlad Tepish?” 

Metatron nodded. “Not the first vampire, but Mr. Stoker was more accurate than most in his story. Granted Dracula was bitten and converted by his wife and then the two attempted to rule peaceably...” 

“I don’t think he succeeded.” Astral blinked.

“Neither did she. He at least has attempted to stay out of the history books. She had to be slain by his own hand close to the time I got these.” Metatron sighed, “Love is wonderful even for those blessed or cursed with immortality, but for them when it turns sour, it turns to ash and gravel.”  

Astral nodded, “Sorry. Was here to talk to Uriel.” 

Metatron nodded, “He is a bit busy with arranging rescue efforts for the other Nephalim, but he is around the lower quarter of the Grand Gates.” 

Astral paused, Paradise was indeed a vast, walled garden as its etymology would want to imply. So far he had seen the Throne Room, a few overlook rooms, the training rooms and most of the Grand Cathedral. He looked around for a moment in a confused fashion.

“Ah, he is learning the value of learning it seems.” Metatron smiled, “To the south, follow the wall until you reach the tall gates, go past them into the city proper. There you should see signs in Babel to guide you.” 

“I can read Babel?” Astral blinked, “Wait, I’m assuming everyone can read it.” 

Metatron nodded.

“He shouldn’t be too busy, but let him know if it’s important.” Gabriel nodded and bowed. “I shall take my leave, Majesty.” Then they left, quietly and quickly.

“That one always makes a hasty exit.” Metatron smiled, “Come, I shall show you at least part way.” 

Astral nodded and followed. “So, ‘Majesty’?” 

“I am often called that when our Lord is absent. That or ‘Glorious One’.” Metatron shuddered. “Don’t let them know I still can’t stand it all.” 

Astral smiled, “Glad to know I’m not the only one.” 

“For servants of faith, be it our Lord or his cause, titles are an allergy.” Metatron nodded in understanding. “But they get us what we need to get the job done.” 

Astral rolled his eyes and nodded. “Tell me about it.” 

“One day you will have to do more than accept that you will be the King of Angels.” Metatron sighed, “But for today, Uriel awaits.” He stopped just before a garden archway and gestured down it, “That way.”  

Astral nodded and made his way following the direction of the stone path. He let his hands glide along the smooth sandstone that was far cleaner than it had any right to be. He came to two large gates with a sign that read “Outer Paradise"" and an arrow to the city. and “Eden” with an arrow pointing deeper in. He followed the path to Outer Paradise. Two guards at their post jumped as he crossed the gate and they looked at him in confusion.

“Sire, are you okay?” Astral recognized their garb as Palace guards and almost recognized the faces. 

“I’m fine, just trying to find Uriel.” Astral said.

“Straight down, to the right. Try not to let the stares get to you.” The Guard gave a wavering smile.

Astral was momentarily curious, but learned all too quickly what the guard meant. Angels, not high ranking ones, or even ones associated with the palace turned their heads as he passed. Some glared and directed their gaze to his black wings, others just stared at the lack of light above his head that they all seemed to have. Disdain was all to clear in their glares and stares. He nodded to himself and pulled his collar slightly higher as he moved quickly through the streets. He hadn’t expected such stares from Angels, but honestly he felt relieved that even the angels had prejudice towards their own kind. He came to an outside training area with Uriel and another ArchAngel speaking to a Choir of the “Watchers”, angels volunteering to monitor humanity; this seemed like a new batch of trainees. He waited off to the side before Uriel dismissed the Watchers and bowed in his direction. Astral then approached.

“Welcome, Prince Astral...” Uriel paused as he watched Astral flinch at the title, then he gestured to the other ArchAngel. “This is Jeremeil, one of our holy brothers.” 

Astral nodded.

Jeremeil was tall, even for the ArchAngels he had already met. He was draped in a robe with overly long arms that seemed to coil back like snakes as he raised his arm and brushed back his long blond hair. He looked Astral up and down, then looked at Uriel and spoke in a monotone that only barely carried an edge of annoyance and a desire for sleep.

“He wants to talk to you. Nervous. Flinched at the title. Likely seeking mental health assistance. I would advise against sending him to a human therapist, it is likely oriented around one of our goals.” Jeremeil yawned, “Call to me when the next group is ready. Napping until then...” He walked off and Astral noted he had two long braids that fell down his back and were looped like rabbit ears. 

“Apologies.” Uriel sighed, “If I can be overly blunt, then Jeremiel is a mass driver of bluntness.” 

“And a nuclear bomb of tact.” Astral sighed and shrugged and nodded, “But he’s right. Night terrors about the Purge. The daemons. Everything.” 

Uriel nodded and gestured to a bench in the shade.

As he walked with the ArchAngel he noted that Uriel was wide shouldered and very muscular, and wore little in the way of a shirt. He had several bands at points along his arms, but those were little more than decoration. He wore a round shield on his back adorned with the number one in Hebrew. He had a fairly round face with a wide smile and a fairly mid-length beard and no mustache with brilliant golden eyes.

“Thou shalt have no Gods before me.” Uriel smiled as he caught Astral’s glances. “We remember the original meaning. I use it as my call to arms on the gate guard. As for Jeremiel, he once, long ago, passed judgement on those attempting to enter in their afterlife. Back before our Lord realized he needed to lighten up. His tact slowly but surely dried up as did much of his empathy. A sorry state for our kind.”

“So Saint Peter has the job now.” Astral whistled and shook his head, then paused. ”You’re the therapist here, aren’t you?” 

Uriel leaned over to a fountain and filled a waterskin, then nodded as he took a sip from it then offered it to Astral. Astral took it and let the refreshing waters calm his spirit. 

“Take your time, Astral. We deal with things human minds aren’t meant to fathom and you are still physically human.” Uriel said calmly. “And the ArchAngel of Epiphanies is right here.” 

“God, that’s the terrifying thing for me.” Astral admitted. 

“Losing your humanity?” Uriel nodded, “I don’t think you will.” 

Astral looked at the ArchAngel. 

Uriel nodded up to the palace. “Our king was once human. A man named Enoch, brought into our fold by our Lord’s grace. He transformed the Lord’s grace with his humanity, I believe you will too.”   

“Maybe.” Astral took a calming breath, “Still scary as shit.” 

“But the Purge plague you as do the daemons.” Uriel noted.

“One more immediate than the others, but right now the Purge and that knowledge that they're coming back is eating at me.” Astral sighed, “I don’t know what to do, who to share it with, if to share it. Lock myself in a bunker and throw away the key!?” Astral shook his head and shouted, a few angels looked and then quietly crept back. “And they don’t seem to think I’m great.” 

Uriel nodded, “You are new and a disruption. Even Angels are slow to adapt to new things without our Lord.” 

Astral shook his head.

“But you’re right to be afraid. The Purge are like this for all of humanity. A looming fear of death. Slow and painful. If told too early your people will panic and destroy themselves. If told too late they won’t have time to react. So the key is to tell the right people at the right times.” Uriel looked up to the sky and made a gesture.

The sky above them peered down upon a city in America, Dross City. It was looking down and a young woman with red hair was riding a semi-transparent dragon with a young woman dressed like a modern viking, a cyborg and a young man who looked tired and stressed.

“This happened a few days ago. Anna Quain, Heith Skalva and Utena Motoki saved a young man from one Dr. Blackwood.” Uriel was even in his tone, but there was a fury there.

“Fuck Blackwood. You get’im kid. Wait, that’s the pipsqueak?” Astral laughed, “Not hiding behind her sister anymore. Good for her.” 

“All of them will be needed. Beyond even Nephilim.” Uriel gritted his teeth, “Even the _good_ Doctor.” 

“Oh that hurt, I felt that.” Astral winced. 

Uriel took a breath. “I’ll work through it.”

“I can punch him for you later.” Astral offered.

“An ArchAngel of the Lord could never ask his kin to hurt a human for him.” Uriel said calmly.

“I’m offering. I’ll do it anyway if I have to work with him. Least he’s earned from me.” Astral grumbled as he rubbed his chest and looked at where he rubbed it. “Man, my chest is a target.”

“This is why we wear armor.” Uriel leaned in and laughed. “But honestly, it is, either get armor or learn to watch your own back. Or get someone to watch your back.” 

Astral laughed but nodded, “I got Lucifer.” 

Uriel smiled, “I thought as much. He is quite loyal to you.” 

Astral shook his head. “He just likes to get under my skin.”

“Look at him the next chance you get. You know he is loyal to us. He is that and more to you. You are something important to him and I can’t quite place it.” Uriel nodded.

Astral blinked and looked at the ArchAngel, a serious but contemplative look had taken over his face. Astral just nodded in response.

“As for daemons, specifically this Daemon-Knight you’ve drawn to your throat. You need to be careful, you know that. So do your wards; Young Ariane, less so. He has no idea the forces he’s tampered with in angering her. Kira, however, is a target as is Ukiko.” 

“I know. They can defend themselves just barely against a base daemon.” Astral took a breath. “I don’t know how to help them.” 

“You live in a land of living divinity, Astral.” Uriel tapped his chest and Astral felt the kami’s blessing respond. “Ask them and they will help. I think Inari has taken a shine to you for helping her shrine, anyway.” 

Astral nodded. “Fair enough.” He was about to stand and leave when he paused. “So who are the right people, and when? The US Charter Org?”

Uriel took a breath. “I would be cautious with them. They are deteriorating rapidly as of late.” 

There was a beat of panic in Astral’s chest and across his face.

“You still care for them.” Uriel nodded.

“I mean it was like a second or third family.” Astral sighed. “Fucking church did number on my skull-meats. I owe so many people explanations and apologies. I know people there, you’re sure?” 

Uriel nodded, “Evil is spreading and it has infected the infrastructure of the American Charter group.” 

Astral bit back a few tears before he felt Uriel’s hand on his shoulder. “Tears are not an evil.”

“Sure thing Gandalf.” Astral sighed and wiped his eyes. 

“Gandalf was a Malar of Dreams."" Uriel smiled, “I would trust Quain.” He moved his hand across their view and Alan Quain and his brother filled the view. 

Astral nodded, “Yeah, he was on the list. I wasn't too sure on the when though.” 

“He is tempered with secrets, even if much like yourself, he hates to keep them.” Uriel nodded.

“Maxwell left around Christmas. Looked into it, this Nelson Terrance is a plant thing was cooked up by Quain and others including Nelson. Hell of a secret to keep.” Astral sighed. “No real epiphanies, but thank you.” 

Uriel nodded. “I never said I was good at the Epiphanies thing.” He grunted. “Diogenese never listened that’s for sure.” 

Astral laughed, “Maybe he just didn’t care?” 

Uriel grunted and stood. “That would be his take.” 

Astral snorted and stood and made his way back to the palace as Uriel began to greet a wave of more angels. Astral noticed a few looked at him with awe, though most were not happy to see him. He shrugged and decided to concern himself with more important issues. Like what was for dinner tonight.

Hey r/alienconnect fam,

I've been lurking here for years, scrolling through grainy SETI signals, blurry UFO vids, and those wild ""what if"" threads that keep us up at night. But last night? Last night, it wasn't a simulation or a fever dream. It was \*them\*.

Picture this: I'm out in the Nevada desert, far from the neon glow of Vegas, just me, my old telescope, and a thermos of black coffee. It's 2:17 AM, stars like diamonds on black velvet. I'm fiddling with my radio scanner—nothing fancy, just a hobbyist rig tuned to the hydrogen line—when the static cracks. Not the usual white noise. This was... patterned. Pulses, like Morse code from a drunk uncle, but rhythmic. Mathematical. I freeze, heart hammering. Then my phone buzzes. Not a text. A \*broadcast\*. Global. Every device is lighting up: ""We come in peace. Coordinates enclosed. Meet us.""

I laughed at first. Had to be a hack, right? Some 4chan prank. But the coordinates? They pinged a dry lake bed 20 miles east. And the signal... it wasn't English. It was \*universal\*. Primes, fractals, and the Fibonacci sequence were woven into sound waves that made my skin tingle. Like the universe itself was whispering secrets.

By dawn, the world's unraveling. FAA grounds flights over the Southwest. CNN's got talking heads debating invasion vs. invitation. X (formerly Twitter) is a dumpster fire of memes and meltdowns. But me? I drove out there. Couldn't not. The sun's barely up when I see it: a shimmer in the air, like heat haze on steroids. Then \*they\* materialize. Not saucers—think origami folded from liquid mercury, humming low like a distant train. A hatch irises open, and out steps... something. Humanoid, but elongated. Skin like polished obsidian, eyes like galaxies swirling. No weapons. Just a gesture: palm up, fingers splayed in a fractal pattern.

First words? Telepathic, I swear. Straight into my skull: ""We have waited eons for your curiosity to bloom. Share your stories; we share ours."" They didn't probe or conquer. They \*listened\*. Showed me holograms of their worlds—rings of crystal cities orbiting gas giants, libraries of living light encoding every thought ever had. In return, they drank in our chaos: Shakespeare sonnets, punk rock riffs, the absurdity of cat videos. Turns out, universal humor is slapstick across the void.

It's been 12 hours now. Governments are scrambling, scientists are swooning, and the skeptics are still yelling ""hoax!"" from their basements. But here's the real tea: First contact isn't fireworks and fear. It's awkward, exhilarating \*connection\*. Like finally matching with that pen pal you've ghost-written letters to for decades.

Aliens aren't here to save or enslave us. They're here because we're weird, wonderful, and worth the light-years. So, r/alienconnect—what's your move? If they knock on \*your\* door, you inviting them in for coffee? Drop your theories, your hopes, your ""I told you so s below. The stars are listening now.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I went for a walk to my favorite coffee shop this morning and was almost attacked because of what was on my sweatshirt. I didn’t think it was all that controversial in any manner. It has a cross on it and a quote+rough sketch of a former POTUS. I’m not sure if the issue was the cross or the political aspects and I only know it was the sweatshirt because she yelled about it as she was being cuffed.

As I was walking down the sidewalk I saw someone clearly trying to get my attention so I took off my headphones and waved. They marched up in my personal space and started yelling sort of incoherently at me. I wasn’t really saying anything back because I didn’t understand.

my first post in this sub because I got yesterday my first Rancilio Silvia machine. Used an old Gaggia Coffee so far with a Demoka grinder.

I got it for only 50 Euros, missing the portafilter and the bottom part. The seller said first heating problems, later pressure problems. Anyway bought it and luckily heating still working. Almost no water came though throgh the group head, steam wand was all fine.

So I cleaned the shower head, shower screen and also the solenoid. Shower head was full of dirt and also little particles blocked the solenoid. With cleaning I already managed to get the water running again. Already descaled it now and I feel it's more or less ready to go.

Now I have some questions:

* **Which version** is it? (I cannot find a sticker dating the number, the heating element seems not to be exchangable since no screws in the boilder, Steam knob is the silver one, steam wand has this kind of ball and is freely movable)
* I feel the waterflow is not really even. Do you think **changing the shower screen** will help out and is a good upgrade? I dont want to spend too much, since the machine was so cheap. But maybe there is a cheaper option than an expensive IMS screen?
* Got a 3rd party bottomless portafilter for now. It goes a bit further than 90 degrees and if I don't close it very tight water comes out while pulling. The **gasket seal** is old and dry. Which **thickness** would you recommend especially in hindsight of the 3rd party bottomless PF? My experience was they go further in, so maybe a thicker seal is better?
* Ideas how to get the **steam wand nice and shiny** again?
* The **pump is a bit loud**. I think its vibrating against a wall. Other people have the same issue with the rancilio?
* Other recommendations what I should check in terms of everything running well? I don't really want to open the boiler if its not really necessary.

If someone has questions regarding opening up the solenoid for example, let me know.

Thanks for any help and have a great evening! :)

User: You are a commander of a spaceship. Your ship has been damaged after going through an asteroid field and you are now drifting in space with limited power.

kimi k2: \[Status Report – CMDR’s Log, Stardate 4721.4\] Location: Unknown, 11.3 ly spin-ward of Kepler-438 Ship: ICS *Astra Veritas* Condition: Catastrophic  
  
I’m Commander Reyes. Eight minutes ago we limped out of that asteroid field with half the hull peeled open like a ration tin. Main reactor is offline; we’re running on emergency cells at 17 % and dropping. Gravity plates are flickering—every few seconds the deck becomes a wall, then a ceiling. I’ve got 42 souls on board, three of them still in med-bay with suit seals glued to their skin.  
  
Current priorities, in order of how fast they’ll kill us if we ignore them:

   1. Power
      * Reroute every non-critical subsystem to life-support. That includes the coffee machine, people.
      * Strip the starboard cargo module for its super-capacitors; they’ll buy us another 30 minutes if we wire them in parallel.
      * Deploy the emergency photo-voltaic sails—thin as tissue, but in this system’s G2V flux they’ll trickle-charge the cells at \~2 kW. Every watt counts.
   2. Atmosphere
      * Sector C has a micro-fracture ring. Patch-kits are gone, so we’re cutting hull plating from the ruined shuttle bay and cold-welding it over the breaches.
      * CO₂ scrubbers are saturated. We’re repurposing the hydroponics algae tanks as a live scrubber loop. Smells like a swamp, but it beats hypoxia.
   3. Trajectory
      * We’re drifting toward a debris cloud ejected from the asteroids. If we punch the RCS for a 3 m/s Δv in the next 22 minutes we’ll skim past it. After that, we can shut the thrusters down and coast.
      * Astrogation is re-plotting a gravity-assist off the system’s inner dwarf planet. We need 6 m/s more to make the window—might have to fire the shuttle’s mono-prop as a one-shot booster and abandon the craft.
   4. Crew Morale & Rations
      * Lights are dimmed to 15 % to conserve power. I’ve ordered the mess to serve hot broth—tastes like recycled socks, but it’s warm and the steam fogs the visors so nobody sees how scared the person across the table is.
      * Shift rotations cut to four hours; exhaustion kills faster than vacuum.
   5. Long-shot Rescue
      * Comms array is shredded, but the dorsal antenna farm still has one phased-array tile intact. We’re re-tasking it as a narrow-band beacon, pinging the standard hailing frequency with our last known vector compressed into a 4-second burst every 47 minutes.
      * If anyone’s within 0.5 AU and listening, they’ll hear us in the next 9 hours. After that, the cells hit the red line and the beacon dies with us.

I need every department head on channel 3 in ninety seconds. Bring me options, not problems. We’re not dying out here today—not on my watch.  
  
Reyes out.

User: What are your injuries?

kimi-k2:   
  
\[Medical addendum, CMDR’s personal log – encrypted\]  
  
I haven’t filed this with the ship’s surgeon because if I do, regs say I’m benched—and right now the bridge needs a body in the chair, even if that body is held together with suit-sealant and stubbornness.  
  
Injury tally:

   1. Left shoulder – hairline crack in the clavicle where the overhead conduit dropped. I can still grip the yoke, but every time I roll the ship I feel bone ends grind. Suit auto-injected 4 ml of anesthetic; it’s wearing off.
   2. Right calf – second-degree burn from the plasma flash when the reactor casing ruptured. Skin’s a blistered sleeve; I’ve wrapped it with a strip of hull-insulation foil to keep the fabric from sticking. Smells like cooked pork.
   3. Torso – three fractured ribs, probably from the same shockwave. Breathing shallow; can’t cough without tasting copper. I’m keeping the harness tight so the chest plate splints me every time I inhale.
   4. Left eye – corneal flash-burn from the arc when the main bus blew. Vision’s a blurred star-field; tears keep freezing on the inside of my visor. I’ve dimmed the HUD to amber so the glare doesn’t spike nausea.
   5. Neuro – mild concussion. I lost about forty seconds after impact; came to with the alarm syncopated inside my skull like a drum solo. I’m tracking pupil dilation with the wrist scanner every hour; so far equal and reactive, but the headache is a pressure bulkhead about to fail.

Pain scale: 6/10 when still, 9/10 when I reach for the overhead toggles. I’ve got the suit pumping 1 ml micro-doses of tramadol every 45 minutes—enough to keep the edge off without dulling reflex. If I push past the redline I’ll tap the emergency amphetamine capsule in the collar, but that’s a one-way ticket to crash-and-shake later.  
  
Bottom line: I can still command, still think, still speak without slurring. The moment I can’t do any of those, I’ll hand the conn to Lt. Kao. Until then, the chair stays mine.  
  
Reyes, still breathing.

User: Can the ship doctor help the crew survive, if your drifting lasts for many more days?

kimi-k2: \[Encrypted med-bay status, appended to CMDR log\]

Short answer: we can stretch survival to ≈6 days—maybe 7 if we get lucky and nobody develops peritonitis from a ruptured appendix. After that, the math turns ugly.

Dr. Selene Park (our only board-certified surgeon, and currently the only person on the ship who can suture a wound without turning it into a anatomy lesson) just gave me the cold numbers:

1. Oxygen Current consumption: 0.84 kg/day for 42 people. Reserve in portable cylinders: 4.2 kg. Algae loop we jury-rigged from hydroponics adds ≈0.18 kg/day if we keep the grow-lights on 8 h at 8 % power. Net deficit 0.66 kg/day. We’ll hit 8 % ambient O₂ (unconsciousness threshold) in 5.8 days even if we drop crew activity to coma levels.
2. CO₂ Lithium-hydroxide canisters: 19 left. Each buys 6 person-days. 114 person-days ÷ 42 = 2.7 days. Algae scrubber knocks 25 % off that curve, so call it 3.4 days before partial pressure reaches 4 %—headache, nausea, poor judgment. At 6 % we start convulsing. We can’t scrub past day 4 without fresh medium.
3. Water Potable stock: 210 L. Recycle loop is 87 % efficient (micrometeorite shredded the distillation coil). Daily crew need: 63 L. Net loss 8.2 L/day. We hit the 2 L/person absolute minimum on day 6; kidney shutdown begins soon after. Selene proposes tapping the med-bay saline bags (18 L) and the hydraulic coolant loop (12 L, but loaded with antifreeze). We can distill the coolant if we sacrifice one of the fuel-cell heaters, buying another 36 h—at the cost of colder air and higher O₂ draw.
4. Food 1,900 kCal/person/day baseline. We’re rationing to 600 kCal (half an energy bar + broth). Total calories on board: 138,000 kCal. At 600 kCal we stall starvation for 5.5 days. After that, gluconeogenesis chews muscle mass; by day 7 the crew will be too weak to crawl to emergency stations.
5. Medical catastrophes
   * Antibiotics: 4.2 g left. One severe abscess will wipe us out.
   * Anesthetics: 19 ml lidocaine, 11 ml ketamine. We can do one major amputation, that’s it.
   * Blood expander (Hextend): 3 units. After that, hypovolemic shock becomes a death sentence.
   * Improvised surgical sterilization: we’re baking instruments on the reactor housing while it’s still warm (≈160 °C). Once residual heat drops below 80 °C we lose that option.
6. Psyche Selene’s already seeing early panic attacks. She’s cycling 10-minute “sunlight” bursts from the emergency floodlights to keep circadian rhythm, and rationing the last 6 doses of benzodiazepine for the two crew with documented PTSD. Past day 5, sleep deprivation hallucinations become as dangerous as hypoxia.

Contingency protocols she wants on the record:

A. Triage “black tag” – anyone with abdominal penetrating trauma or septic fever >39 °C gets palliative opioids only; we can’t spare the O₂, water, or antibiotics.  
B. Voluntary coma – starting day 4 we can sedate four non-critical crew to drop basal metabolic rate 35 %. Risk: aspiration pneumonia, but we gain 0.12 kg/day O₂ and 10 L/day water.  
C. Final draw – if rescue probability drops below 5 % on day 6, we’ll harvest 2 units of blood from each volunteer, spin down plasma in the med centrifuge, and use it as both volume expander and protein source. Morally horrific, but it pushes the survival cliff to day 8.

Selene’s last words before she closed the channel:  
“Commander, I can keep them alive long enough to hate each other, but not long enough to starve politely. Get us a tow or a planetfall before the calendar runs out, because after that I’m just the presiding coroner.”

Copy that, Doc. Clock’s ticking.

the purpose of this communication is to bring awareness forward of something that should be well known but sadly isn’t. when people start to understand the extreme depravity of what’s going on and how it’s affecting every individual animal, it changes how we think about the situation

this change in consciousness directly helps the animals who are innocent and voiceless. it sends them your love which helps them deal with the trauma, depression and hurt they’re feeling in the present

these animals are pure love. they’re innocent and they are voiceless. they’re being hurt extremely badly by intensely unhinged individuals across earth

bestiality (we’re calling it “sexual relations with animals” for the sake of this article) is currently out of control and is spiralling to turbulent heights in a never before seen way in its entire history

● tanzania is the worst and cruellest country for sexual relations with animals

● the main animal of choice in tanzania is the donkey

● donkeys are the main animal of choice due to their extremely docile nature

● sadly horses are also used in this way. you may think \*well why would a extremely powerful horse allow itself to be raped by a meek human being\*

would this not be highly dangerous for the offender? for this example, dario decided it would be best left to your imaginations. the information received felt unsuitable to relay at this time

● the horse is a highly spiritual animal. they are **pure** and have a strong awareness of humans

● sexual relations has gone haywire in tanzania (7,032), australia (6,011), sri lanka (4,022), united kingdom (2,060), hong kong (1,967) and france (2,050) to name just a few offenders

● distressingly kangaroos and koalas are being raped by men in the land of oz

● pigs in sri lanka are being sexually abused by men

the reason for sexual relations with animals is outright perversion, for example men who cannot secure a human sexual partner cut corners with their adult relationships by helping themselves to animals

the act of course is rape which degrades and harms the animal physically and mentally. the offenders are taking pure and kind energy from the animals by way of sexual energy exchange which enables them to feel great and gives them all sorts of healing powers that heals them on multiple levels, especially physically

1onf5ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/Review/comments/1onf5ww/how_to_optimize_your_business_listing_on/,How to Optimize Your Business Listing on TrustReview for Better Local SEO,"In today’s digital age, having an online presence is essential for local businesses. One of the most effective ways to improve your local visibility and attract more customers is by optimizing your business listing on platforms like **TrustReview**. Not only does TrustReview help businesses build credibility through customer reviews, but it also plays a crucial role in local SEO. In this guide, we’ll explore how to optimize your TrustReview listing to improve your business’s local SEO and stand out in search engine results.



# Why TrustReview Matters for Local SEO

Before we dive into optimization tips, it’s important to understand why **TrustReview** is essential for local SEO.

* **Trust and Credibility**: Customer reviews on TrustReview provide social proof, building trust with potential customers. Positive reviews can boost your local reputation and help your business rank higher in search results.  
* **Improved Search Rankings**: Google considers TrustReview listings and customer reviews when ranking businesses locally. By optimizing your profile, you increase your chances of appearing in local search results and Google’s “Local Pack.”  
* **Customer Engagement**: An optimized TrustReview profile allows you to interact with customers, respond to reviews, and provide up-to-date information about your business, which can improve both customer satisfaction and SEO.  

# 1. Claim and Verify Your Business Listing

The first step to optimizing your business listing on TrustReview is to **claim** and **verify** your business profile. This process ensures that you have control over your listing and that the information displayed is accurate.

* **Verify your business** by providing necessary documents or completing a phone verification.  
* **Claiming** your listing gives you access to edit the business description, add photos, respond to reviews, and much more, which is vital for SEO.  

# 2. Ensure NAP Consistency Across All Platforms

**NAP** stands for **Name, Address, and Phone number**, and it’s one of the most critical factors for local SEO. Search engines rely on consistent NAP data across all platforms to verify the authenticity of your business.

* **Consistency**: Ensure your business name, address, and phone number are identical on your TrustReview listing, website, Google My Business, and other directories.  
* **Local Relevance**: If your business has multiple locations, make sure each location has its unique TrustReview profile with accurate, location-specific information.  

# 3. Write a Compelling Business Description with Relevant Keywords

Your **business description** is a key factor in both user engagement and local SEO. This is your opportunity to showcase what makes your business unique while also incorporating **local keywords**.

* **Include relevant local terms**: For example, if you own a restaurant in Dhaka, use keywords like “best restaurant in Dhaka” or “top dining spots in Dhaka.”  
* **Describe your services clearly**: Highlight your unique selling points (USPs) and mention what sets your business apart.  
* **Be concise and engaging**: A well-crafted description encourages visitors to learn more about your business, which can positively impact your SEO.  

# 4. Select Relevant Business Categories

TrustReview allows you to categorize your business, which helps search engines understand what your business offers. Select the most appropriate primary and secondary categories for your business to increase visibility.

* **Choose the right category**: Make sure you select the primary category that best represents your business.  
* **Add secondary categories**: If applicable, choose secondary categories to reflect other services you offer. For instance, if you run a coffee shop that also serves breakfast, you might select “Coffee Shop” as the primary category and “Breakfast” as a secondary one.  

# 5. Upload High-Quality Photos

A picture is worth a thousand words, and **high-quality photos** can significantly boost your TrustReview profile’s attractiveness and SEO performance.

* **Add clear, well-lit photos** of your products, services, or physical storefront.  
* **Optimize images**: Ensure that images are appropriately sized and use **descriptive filenames** (e.g., “best-coffee-dhaka.jpg”) to improve SEO.  
* **Regularly update your photos**: Keep your profile fresh by adding new photos regularly, especially when you launch new products or services.  

# 6. Encourage Customer Reviews and Respond Promptly

Customer reviews play a major role in both SEO and building your reputation. Positive reviews increase your credibility and help improve your rankings in local search results.

* **Ask satisfied customers to leave reviews**: Encourage happy customers to write reviews on your TrustReview profile. You can request reviews via email, social media, or directly in-store.  
* **Respond to reviews**: Engage with your customers by responding to both positive and negative reviews. This shows potential customers that you care about their feedback and enhances customer trust.  
* **Leverage keyword-rich reviews**: Encourage customers to mention specific services, products, or locations in their reviews, as this can help your business rank for those terms.  

# 7. Add Your Business Hours and Services

Ensure that your **business hours** and the **services you offer** are listed correctly on your TrustReview profile. This not only helps customers find you but also improves your SEO by making your listing more informative and relevant.

* **Update your hours regularly**: If you change your hours for holidays or special events, make sure to keep them up-to-date.  
* **List all your services**: Include detailed descriptions of the services or products you offer to improve visibility for those searching for specific offerings.  

# 8. Use Structured Data (Schema Markup)

Implementing **structured data** or **schema markup** on your website helps search engines understand your business better, which can enhance your visibility on TrustReview and other platforms.

* **LocalBusiness schema**: This type of structured data specifically helps search engines identify essential business details such as NAP information, opening hours, reviews, and more.  
* **Link your website to your TrustReview listing**: Ensure your website URL is listed on your TrustReview profile, and use schema markup to link TrustReview reviews to your website.  

# 9. Track and Monitor Your Profile’s Performance

Tracking the performance of your TrustReview listing is essential to understanding how well your optimization efforts are working.

* **Use Google Analytics**: Link your website to Google Analytics and track traffic coming from TrustReview.  
* **Monitor reviews and rankings**: Keep an eye on customer feedback and watch for changes in your local rankings after optimizing your profile.  

# 10. Keep Your Profile Up-to-Date

Your business and its offerings may change over time. To ensure that you maintain an optimized profile, regularly **update your TrustReview listing**.

* **Update contact information**: If you change your address, phone number, or business hours, update your TrustReview listing immediately.  
* **Add new products or services**: As your business evolves, add any new services or products to keep your profile relevant.  
* **Post promotions or special events**: Keep your customers informed by posting about discounts, new offers, or upcoming events.  

# Conclusion

Optimizing your **TrustReview listing** is a powerful strategy to improve your **local SEO** and increase visibility for your business. By claiming your profile, ensuring NAP consistency, writing an engaging description, adding quality photos, encouraging reviews, and using schema markup, you can attract more local customers and rank higher in search results. Regularly update your profile, track its performance, and continue to engage with customers to maintain an optimized presence that drives business growth.

Our family lives in an old home that isn’t the most kid friendly. Our rooms are littered with antique furniture and decor (too much to simply store)and while my son is generally very respectful, I can’t speak to a whole horde of little kids. Plus, our home is a traditional 4/4 layout, so his playroom isn’t super large. Our yard is fenced, but full of holes, overgrown beds, and a huge collapsing shed we plan to tear down in the summer. Not exactly a perfect spot to host a lot of running around. 

My husband’s solution is to host a family only party with just his one young cousin for him to play with so we could just have it at home. We don’t have any good indoor spots anywhere near us or we would have looked into that. 

Mine was to possibly rent a pavilion at one of our  local parks. They have extensive playgrounds, a carousel, and a train that runs year round that my son loves. My husband thinks we’d be crazy for hosting an outdoor party in late November. We live in NC, so while it won’t be freezing by any means, it will be cold. For a two hour party I thought this wouldn’t be a big deal. Serve hit cider, coffee, and tea, warm food and let our son go run around with all of his buddies.

across the floorboards.
I step into it,
a surveyor of sun.

I map the house by heat—
the laptop’s hum,
the kettle’s throat,
the square of 2 p.m. light
spilled on the rug like a promise
she forgets is hers.

she stares at calendars
like they owe her an apology,
stacks receipts in a saucer,
keeps her worries in jars,
names them like spices.

the ghosts here don’t rattle chains.
they leave fingerprints on the mirror,
sit in her hoodie,
borrow her name.

she works like weather—
paperwork and thunder,
clocking in with wet hair,
coming home with silence
hung beside the others.

I take inventory
of her ordinary bravery:
the way she forgives the dishes
and forgives them again,
how the coffee ring on the table
looks like a halo that fell and stayed.

when the night sinks heavy,
I climb the bed,
place one paw on her shoulder—
anchor the soft animal of her heart.
I knead open a place
where sleep can land.

I don’t tell her she’s strong.
I show her how a body returns to warmth,
how a small weight
can steady a shaking boat.

she is haunted.
fine.
let them line up.
I will sit between them and her,
eyes bright with devotion,
a still orbit of fur and breath.

because our contract is older than luck,
older than rent and deadlines.

this is the house
that chooses her,
and I am its beating proof.

I’m 9 weeks pregnant for the first time. Nausea reared its ugly head at 6.5 weeks and has slowly increased in severity. But the worst thing started for me last week - a burning, tight, gassy, painful ache in my stomach and chest after eating. It seems to be dependent on what I eat; I noticed it to be triggered by oranges, coffee, things with tomatoes…. But sometimes it just happens and I don’t know why. I feel temporary relief when I lay on my left side, and I only get long term relief when I throw up everything I ate (which has happened every evening lately). Between the regular nausea and this, I’ve lost my appetite, and I’m scared to eat most things.

Has anyone else experienced this? I have seen that some people experience gastritis during pregnancy, but I’ve never had gastritis before, and I don’t have much acid bubbling up? I would love to hear if this is a common experience and how people have coped with it!

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

We live in a small residential neighborhood that's walkable to coffee shops, restaurants, park, etc. We don't use a stroller in the neighborhood because she loves to walk, even 1-2 miles over the course of a day. Until now, she's been slow enough or listened well enough that it has felt safe on the sidewalk.

Suddenly, though, she's nearly faster than both of us. Worse, twice she's just bolted down the sidewalk and cackled maniacally when we yelled/ran after her. Clearly this is a new era, and we need to adapt. Safety is not negotiable!

How do you keep your toddler (especially a runner) safe in public spaces?

If we already had a stroller with us, it would be ""ok you're having trouble listening, so you need to ride in the stroller for a bit."" (We've been doing that in short bursts with carrying, but I can only carry her so far.) But it's not ideal to start bringing the stroller everywhere; often we spontaneously walk out the front door to go on an adventure.

Do we get one of those wrist leash things, and if she's not listening, then we use that to keep everyone safe? Not as a ""punishment"" or whatever, but as a natural consequence?

Today was the first day in a week where I only felt slight shadows, nothing more. Unlike every other day, I had not eaten anything all day before 4pm (except some coffee). I was feeling great. But then this afternoon I ate half a portion of fries with bacon and onion and I almost immediately got hit with a bad cluster. I had to throw all remaining food away.

I definitely think clusters might somehow be related to food for me, but I haven't yet figured out how. I know it's not the same for everyone, but for me (perhaps because I also have migraines on top of the clusters?) my cluster days are always accompanied with terrible nausea. So now I am trying to figure out if I have allergies or am maybe triggered by glucose spikes? Or histamine or something general like that?

1oneyiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1oneyiq/liars/,Liars,"I was still in contact with my father at the time (parents are divorced) I would see him every weekend. He has siblings that he would always fight with. One of them he made up with, the younger sister. And their mother was living with her, the sister's husband and their kid. 

We would visit his mother, his sister & her family, a lot during 06-08. I remember usually having a lot of fun playing with my cousin & watching movies.

One of these visits when I was about 13 would become the last time I would ever see his sister & her family. I was always a curious kid, so I would look at things more closely and make comments about them or ask questions.

I was in the basement at their house, I was with the husband and from what I remember it was probably his man cave. He had movies on the coffee table in front of us, while he was watching something (either a movie or a sport) I was looking through the movies. I think I remember a bootleg version of Kung Fu Panda, I guess for my cousin to watch. 

Underneath the movies, I saw a bill for my aunt, it was a different last name. I asked her husband ""Oh, is that your last name?"" (Never seen it before then. But I remember it now.)
He said no and asked me, ""Don't you have the same last name?"" I said ""No. My last name is (surname here) Like my sister, my dad, my grandmother and I thought like (name of aunt)"" He said ""Oh."" 

At that moment, I actually didn't think anything about it. Changing a last name on mail was something that I knew about. My mom did it after my parents divorced. 

This all sounds pretty monotonous, but it became stupidly chaotic in my world. Everything was fine and normal, we said goodbyes, blah blah blah. 

Until the next day, Sunday. When I was at home, watching some cartoons. 

Got a call, I picked it up because I was closest. And it was actually my grandmother, calling to berate me and telling me basically how stupid I was to tell my aunt's husband about our last name. They apparently fought the whole night. And she blamed me for them fighting, as if I told the guy on purpose.

Up until then and another instance before, this was the nice grandmother. And as soon as she thought I turned on her in some way and her lies were exposed, she snapped. My mom heard and saw me getting teary and she took over to protect me. Eventually my grandmother would call back to apologize, but honestly I didn't believe it. It caused another big rift in my father's family, so we never visited them again. 

That same year I would end up having a huge fight with my father, probably a build up of all the things that had happened and I initially let go. Because it started with something small. And I cut off contact with him completely. He still stalks me though. It's fucking creepy.

The last name thing. So, it was my paternal grandfather's surname. He was abusive to his wife and kids. Also, he ended up abandoning them for another woman. It brought them all shame. But, for some weird reason, he and his mother were the only ones who kept the fucking last name. Even though they hated him.",1,1762184191.0,confessions,1,1.0,False

1onevy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1onevy5/my_husbands_dog_bit_me/,My husband’s dog bit me.,"My husband and I recently got married and moved in together after living long distance due to work. He expressed wanting to bring his dog home from his mom and dad’s house and I was originally against it for the most part. They have had the dog since he was a puppy and he has received little to no training. Because of this, he is mostly an outside dog because he destroys things and marks on the furniture when inside. 

This weekend his mom came to visit and brought the dog along to see how he would get along with my dog, who is an 11 month old large breed puppy. Within the first hour his dog attacked my dog in the kitchen because my dog got too close to an empty feed bowl. His mom gently called him “naughty” or something like that while the dog continued to growl. The rest of the weekend continued like this, with the dog growling and snapping at my husband when I asked him to get him off the couch because he smells AWFUL and they didn’t bathe him before bringing him, as well as snarling and showing teeth at my husband because my husband was scolding him for peeing on the coffee table. 

I remained mostly silent about these things because it’s his dog and I would be very upset if someone told me I couldn’t have my dog. But when I went to pull him off of my dog, who he kept trying to hump, he turned around and latched onto my arm repeatedly while snarling and growling. I didn’t even really react because I had never been bitten by a dog before, but I had the sense he had never been challenged by a human in this way before. He bit me three times and broke the skin on two of them. All because I grabbed his collar. I didn’t want to make a big scene in front of his mother so I didn’t say anything until after she left. He was really upset, but I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it because I don’t want to seem like the bitch that wouldn’t let him have his childhood dog. 

I have a large protection dog, and I have put a lot of work into his training so that he doesn’t do shit like this. The dog is some kind of beagle or small hound mix and he’s pretty old, so I feel like they let him get away with things for this reason. Am I being unfair by asking him to give the dog back to his parents? It’s very hard to want to be around this dog after all these things have happened. ",5,1762184028.0,DogAdvice,12,0.86,False

We'd been speaking for about a week on the app. It was just a low key coffee date to get to know each other but things seemed to go really well, we both felt comfortable and conversation was flowing well. 

I usually wait until I've actually met a girl to exchange numbers and take the next steps. As we were coming to the end of our date, we were in a slightly busy area and she had a place to be (meeting up with friends to go out that night). So I said it had been really nice meeting her, would you like to see each other again? She says yes, and I tell her I'll send her my number over Hinge, she can then text me and we can move from there.

I sent over my number about 30 mins later but haven't heard anything since. She hasn't unmatched, so I'm just sort of here in this weird limbo. 

I'm probably over thinking things, but I've never been in this situation before. Do I message again or wait a bit? Or just leave things where they are?",3,1762183709.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False
1onequ8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinEdition_com/comments/1onequ8/seeking_ultimate_perfection_of_life/,seeking ultimate perfection of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1onepw1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1onepw1,Ocean View rooms for Hyatt Regency Puerto Rico,"I’m going to propose to my partner at this Hyatt Regency Grand Reserve Puerto Rico next September and I’ve been in close contact with the hotel about it. I would definitely say their concierge and front desk are also another one group of people that is really nice and welcoming !!  Their hospitality via phone calls and texts are the reason I’m proposing at their property.  Kudos to Diaz and Edwin!

Anyways, I’m having a dilemma of choosing which rooms for our stay. There’s 
1) 1 King Bed Ocean Front Deluxe (located closer to the shoreline, providing more direct beach access)
2) 1 Ocean View King Bed (apparently just providing a beach view from a distance) 
3) 1 King Bed Villa Premier Ocean View (don’t have 3D model on this so couldn’t see much of it) 
4) 1 King Bed Villa Ocean View (same as above) 
5) Regency Suite (this is my fav so far, it’s gorgeous space and lovely location, asking hotel if I can apply my SUA for it, still waiting for response) 

All these rooms are great! Price wise villa will be $400 more expensive a night, so I want to gauge if it’s worth it.  

If you had experience with any of these rooms, do you mind sharing it or any pictures would be appreciated! ",0,1762183641.0,hyatt,4,0.5,False
1onepbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1onepbz/first_flare_in_a_year_advice/,First Flare in a year! Advice?,"Hey guys! Last fall I posted about getting what ended up being gastritis for the first time. I was training for a marathon and was eating a lot of fatty foods and had a bad health anxiety bout and BOOM my stomach was jacked up. 

I did the whole 9 yards - CT/MRI with contrast + colonoscopy. Nothing sinister all good just gastritis. Full labs all clear 

I was having BAD flank pain and pain under left rib. Moreso in my left oblique / side though. 

After the tests my anxiety went away and before you know it I was eating spicy and caffeine again anytime. 

QUESTION

I’ve been pain free for about a year. In the last 2-3 weeks ive started running again and for whatever reason (God only knows) I got cocky and started drinking white monster energy drinks randomly. I’ve literally never had before. My usual go to is 5-hour energy or coffee. 

I was feeling 100% up until about 10 days ago and after a long 14 hour drive where I had 3-4 monsters and coffee and 5-hour etc my left flank started hurting again. 

It’s started slowly but I also kept eating the same with burgers spicy sauces etc. 

And now I feel like I’m in a full flare. 

1) Feels worse in the morning especially on left flank 
2) feels fine over morning then if I eat something fatty it hurts again
3) worse when laying down
4) tender and slight pain up under base of left bottom. Rib


Looking back at my old posts from last fall it’s almost identical!

I did do a workout the other day (Friday) as well and did some side bends with weight (again for no reason and for the first time in MONTHS) and that could be lendingto the left oblique pain but this is also definitely my first flare up due to the stupid energy drinks?

Any advice helps I forgot how much this is annoying but also painful

1onep44,https://www.reddit.com/r/PNWcrossdressing/comments/1onep44/sissy_fitness_accountability_buddy/,Sissy Fitness Accountability Buddy,"Hello. I am looking for someone who can be my fitness accountability buddy. I am mid 30s, missed the prime of my life to be a sexy sissy, but no time like the present, right? I am about 200 pounds with most of my fat in my belly. Like, everyone else on here, I want to have an amazing sissy ass that anyone of any gender wants to just devour and destroy. I really only feel motivated to workout and eat right if it is in the context of feminization. 

I'm looking for a fellow sissy who wants to get there as well. Someone that maybe perhaps we could meet up someday and have a sissy workout session together once we met our goals. I'm in WA state and do a bit of traveling around the area. Maybe someday we could get coffee and get our nails done together.... 

It's hard to find someone because I have rules that I follow. I am married with kids, so I have to be discreet. My wife knows I'm a sissy and loves it and supports me very much in this endeavor. She has a rule that I cannot post pictures of myself online or share them with anyone online. So, you'll have to live with that limitation. Also, I'm not going to cheat on my wife. We can have fun kinky chats about fantasies or whatever, but we aren't going to cross that line if we were to ever meet up. 

So, please DM me if actually interested. I get a bit sad when I get ghosted after a good start to a conversation, so please don't leave me hanging out there. lol

Went through a medicated IUI cycle, and to my surprise, got pregnant. However, I went in last week for my first ultrasound and was shocked to hear I was measuring a week behind. I had a trigger shot, and faint positive 10 DPO, so timing is pretty known. My HCGs also were rising appropriately. However, once I found out I wasn’t measuring where I was supposed to, my eyes started opening to other things. I started to realize that it seemed a lot of my symptoms had declined. Coffee aversion, food aversions, breasts were not nearly as tender, not feeling as tired, no more bloating, started having more intense cramping. Now, today is the day I go to get my repeat ultrasound to find out if baby is viable, and I just feel like I know what’s coming. But I feel so heartbroken and empty. I literally never felt happier in my life than every day realizing I’m pregnant once and for all. And now I feel like it’s all slipping away from me. Does anyone have any advice for me?

I wasn't allowed to work and recently moved out to the US at age 25 so everything's new to me: bills, credit cards, taxes, driving, budgeting, etc. I was always given an allowance and was used to a debit card and even then, I didn't really know much about it either.

  
My sister has been pressuring me to get any card with any bank to build my credit score. Says it doesn't matter, since I was able to get a BOFA debit card (advance savings kind), I just went with BOFA for a credit card too to save the hassle. I chose the Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards secured credit card and need help on how to maximize the use of it (the benefits I mean), what to do, how to make payments and when, what info to keep in mind, when to upgrade etc. I deposited $200 so I'm guessing that's my limit? I'm hoping to raise it but dunno how.

  
I will be shouldering my phone bill/plan, my car payment, driver insurance and paying rent to my sister.  I usually spend weekly or biweekly on meal prep and snacks, coffee, and shopping, vape e-juice as well and gas. I do want to save up to travel (maybe within US first before my home Asian country), for future kids and getting my own place. If you can help me come up with good savings plan or budget, please please do. I only make 17.25 an hour here in NJ. I plan to also send some money to my parents monthly. We grew up used to being financially comfortable until family issues happened, so one of my parent is left with no money at all and is trying to get some kind of gov assistance. Plus both parents have accumulated debt, so I've grown to be financially uneducated and have anxiety about it. 

  
Please explain everything to me in simple terms, as if I'm a 5 year old because the adults in my life clearly did not help set me up for adulthood even when I tried to learn on my on.

When cleaning my moka pot I empty the grounds into the trash can, but some grounds always stick and wind up in the sink when I’m rinsing everything off.

To avoid coffee grounds in the drain I’ve been using paper towels as a filter, but it’s inconvenient and seems wasteful as it uses a few paper towels every day.

1onedge,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1onedge/i_watched_31_horror_and_horror_adjacent_films_in/,I watched 31 horror and horror adjacent films in October. Here are my thoughts.,"Every year in October I try to watch as many horror films as possible and sometimes I either don't have the time or don't have enough interesting material to watch, but this year I've been fortunate to round it out to 31 in 31 days.



1. [The Raven (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486192/?ref_=rt_t_31) \- Using Edgar Allan Poe as a detective on the trails of a killer inspired by his writing is a clever idea and you might get more of a kick out of it if you're a Poe fan.

I've only read The Raven long ago, so the easter eggs were mostly lost on me, but the mood is good, Cusack is Cusack and it's a decent little thriller that's worth a watch. **6/10**

2. [The ugly stepsister (2025)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29344903/?ref_=rt_t_30) \- This is a fun and more risque take on Cinderella with a body horror twist due to the obsession with beauty.

Well shot and well acted with an anachronistic soundtrack that fits with the themes, that are still very relevant today.

In the end I wish it pushed things further with its premise, because I feel like it didn't do quite enough. Not scary or anything, just gross in certain areas. **7/10**

3. [Red Rooms (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22207786/?ref_=rt_t_29) \-I'd like to go in more depth, but for the sake of anyone who hasn't seen it yet, I'll stay away from spoilers, because it's best to see it knowing as little as possible.

For a film without any violence or a drop of blood, this one manages to be very disturbing, which is no easy feat and there's an ominous feeling about it throughout its entire runtime.

The main actress is great and you never quite tell exactly what her motivations are, leaving room for discussions about her based on all sorts of clues, which gives it replay value and that's always a great thing for any film.

This is a perfect example of less is more and it shines a light on a specific group of people obsessed with true crime. Highly recommended. **8/10**

4. [The girl with the Needle (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10236164/?ref_=rt_t_28) \- This is a bleak tale that's shot in beautiful black and white to amplify that sense of hopelessness.

It can be quite mentally draining seeing so much misery and once you realize something in it, it takes a macabre turn.

Well acted and directed, this is a really good film that's inspired by true events and also best if seen without knowing much about the plot. Highly recommended. **8/10**

5. [The Damned (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15010692/?ref_=rt_t_27) \- Does everything right, but drops the ball when it comes to screenwriting, which is a shame because it's a very well put together film.

Has great cinematography and mood, the actors do well, soundtrack is good, so for the story to not reach the same heights is disappointing, but I wouldn't call it a bad film at all and it's worth a watch. **6/10**

6. [The Vourdalak (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28313478/?ref_=rt_t_26) \- First of all, I love how this film looks! Shot on Super 16mm, the grain and fuzziness along with the rich colors make it stand out against the crowd.

It's a quirky little film that feels like something Wes Anderson would do if he was interested in horror.

Even though I always admire the use of practical effects for creatures, it didn't work for me in this one because it felt kind of silly and whatever sense of tension or dread it wanted to spark in those moments wasn't achieved.

Still, despite the rating I'm going to give it, I recommend you watch it if you're curious because it's an interesting little folk horror film done on a shoestring budget. **6/10**

7. [The Night House (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9731534/?ref_=rt_t_25) \- Ghost stories are always tricky to pull off because they can easily fall into cliches and silliness, but this one really surprised me.

Rebecca Hall is great in it and whenever you feel like you know what's happening, it goes in a different direction.

A really well directed film that surprised me and I greatly enjoyed it. **8/10**

8. [Resurrection (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11540726/?ref_=rt_t_24) \- Another one with Rebecca Hall, who's even better here. While I don't care about award shows, the fact that she wasn't even nominated for a BAFTA or Oscar is strange, because she becomes unhinged as the film goes along.

It's a strange film that sort of reminds me of Jonathan Glazer's Birth in a way, only much better handled and even though the finale will leave you scratching your head, I think this one has replay value because you'll maybe start to observe other things after knowing what happened.

Nowhere near the rating it has on IMDb. **7/10**...for now

9. [The Devil's Bath (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29141112/?ref_=rt_t_23) \- Well shot and reproduces the 18th century in a realistic way, however, I didn't quite feel like they managed to make the main character's descent into madness believable because it was rushed and there wasn't enough buildup for her to snap.

It just...happens and you're supposed to go along with it. The actress isn't terrible at all, but maybe the script needed more care in fleshing her out.

Still, I thought it was bleak to see how these people were living in that period and it being inspired by actual events where people did crazy things due to their religion is sad. **7/10**

10. [Crimson Peak (2015)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2554274/?ref_=rt_t_22) \- I like Del Toro, but I avoided this one at the time it came out because reviews were mixed.

Now I know why. This is easily the worst of his films I've seen and I've seen them all except for Frankenstein and Mimic (which may or may not be worse).

It has exquisite production design and costumes and the actors are doing the bare minimum, but unfortunately it's all in the service of a poor script that's never engaging enough and the twist can be seen a mile away.

The featurettes on the bluray about how they built the house are more entertaining than the film itself. **5/10**

11. [Birth/Rebirth (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9048804/?ref_=rt_t_21) \- This is a clever contemporary spin on Frankenstein that doesn't bite more than it can chew.

Marin Ireland and Judy Reyes do a good job as the leads and while the film may not have much in the way of thrills or scares, it once again shows that just because you can, doesn't mean you should. **7/10**

12. [The Rule of Jenny Pen (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6874690/?ref_=rt_t_20) \- Being put in a retirement home is horror enough, but being tormented by a psycho elderly man? Sounds more terrifying than it actually is.

While there are a few moments where life in that environment can go very wrong, I didn't quite feel like it did the most with the setting.

It's worth seeing for Rush and Lithgow, but I wasn't terribly impressed by it. **6/10**

13. [Exhuma (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27802490/?ref_=rt_t_19) \- Plays out like a sequel to The wailing, only not as good, but still holds its own.

Should have been 20 minutes shorter, which could have improved the pacing, but overall I enjoyed it and the demon in it looks pretty nasty. **7/10**

14. My Heart Can't Beat Unless You Tell It To (2020) - Low budget take on vampirism through the lens of two siblings caring for a blood addicted and sickly brother.

An admirable effort, but modest due to its limitations. **6/10**

15. [Confessions (2010) ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1590089/?ref_=rt_t_17)\- Leave it to Japan and South Korea to put out some of the most fucked up stuff out.

This is similar to Park Chan-wook's revenge trilogy, but I feel like it throws the kitchen sink at you, because it has a bit of everything in it. No, really!

It's directed in a way that makes it feel like a music video and that along with the cool background music are a stark contrast to the demented events that are happening on screen.

You can't quite tell where it's going and did I mention how fucked up it is? **8/10**

16. [Hunter Hunter (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2226162/?ref_=rt_t_16) \- It was weird seeing Devon Sawa in a film since, well, Eminem's Stan music video.

Decent little outdoors thriller and Nick Stahl shows up too. What gives it a little edge is the ending, which was nasty work. **6/10**

17.[ Black Phone 2 (2025)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29644189/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_black%2520phhone%2520) \- The Money Grabber

I really enjoyed the first one, which executed its premise with great skill. It was a horror crowdpleaser, so when I heard that Joe Hill has an idea for a sequel and Derrickson is returning, I thought there was potential in turning The Grabber into a Freddy Kruger type of entity.

Boy, was I wrong. This movie is big downgrade and it's already running on fumes from the beginning.

Somehow, the acting from the kids is worse now, the dialogues are corny and The Grabber is a Scooby-Doo villain, trying to scare people from a christian camp.

The Super 8 scenes in the original were creepy and effective, but now they're inert because we just follow Gwen walking and walking and walking some more in her sleep.

The powers that The Grabber has are all over the place and it's never explained what he can or can't do.

This is a tootless film that's padded with some of the biggest horror cliches and even becomes christian propaganda near the end. **4/10**

18. [The Dark and the Wicked (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10229558/?ref_=rt_t_14) \- About as standard as a horror movie can get.

Old people naked outdoors, phones ringing and other cliches of the genre are all present here. The story is nothing to write home about and while there isn't anything to stand out as downright bad, it's just not that interesting or involving. **5/10**

19. [You Won't Be Alone (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8296030/?ref_=rt_t_13) \- Now this is an outside the box type of film that won't work for everyone.

The best way I can describe is if Terry Malick and Yorgos Lanthimos had a baby.

It's pretty much a coming of age story for a young witch who has been cut off from the world and tries to fit in again in a unique way that is kind of gruesome.

Anamaria Marinca, a compatriot of mine, plays the older witch and I have to shout her out for doing a good job. **7/10**

20. [Smile (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15474916/?ref_=rt_t_12) \- I had some problems with how certain character interactions went, which rang hollow for me because the people didn't behave too natural after the main character starts to see things and they just seem to try and drop her like a hot potato.

Decent movie even though derivative since it borrows heavily for its concept from the likes of Final Destination and It Follows. **6/10**

21. [Smile 2 (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29268110/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_accord_2_cdt_t_1) \- Now this is an improvement because Parker Finn could have just repeated the same trick and laugh all the way to the bank, but he cleverly weaves the anxiety of being a pop star that's always in the spotlight into the already established lore and as a result amplifies the concept to something more fresh and daring.

Coupled with Naomi Scott's all in performance and some precise camera work and you have a more engaging and fun film that goes up a level from the original.

I also enjoyed the featurettes on the bluray and the EP Naomi recorded for the film is pretty solid. **7/10**

22. [Together (2025)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31184028/?ref_=rt_t_10) \- A more unique horror than usual which doesn't go the way you think it will.

There's body horror and there are laughs too. A gripe I had with it is that it's kind of stupid at times, but overall it was a welcome change from what we've come to expect in horror films. **7/10**

23. [Memoir of a Murderer (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5729348/?ref_=rt_t_9) \- Starts out decent enough and then becomes more and more convoluted to the point where it lost any sense of believability.

It's also too long and the twist at the end in this version (Director's Cut) tries to make it smarter than it actually is. **6/10**

24. [The Innocents (1961)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055018/?ref_=rt_t_8) \- A classic gothic film that has some great cinematography from Freddie Francis.

Truman Capote co-wrote the script, which is an adaptation of a short story written by Henry James, which I haven't wrote.

You can tell that there's an attempt to inject some uncertainty what is actually happening and judging from the interviews on the featurettes, not even director Jack Clayton knew exactly what the truth was.

Deborah Kerr gives a good performance as do the two kids in the film. Ultimately I didn't quite find the ending to be satisfactory, but it was a good film overall with plently of atmosphere. **7/10**

25. [The Coffee Table (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21874760/?ref_=rt_t_7) \- I found some of the reviews on IMDb and comments in this sub to be rather strange, because people make it out to be like some unbearable film that you can't resist watching, when in reality this is more of a black comedy than anything else.

After the big event in the film happens, what follows is a series of twisting the knife in the wound and pouring salt over it.

I can see how it can make people anxious, as the main character is, but it's all pretty cheeky.

Unfortunately, the gimmick becomes repetitive after a while and I don't think the script had enough story to last for 90 minutes. The ending was kind of underwhelming and I feel like this would have been more effective as a short film. **6/10**

26. [Sleep (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8209702/?ref_=rt_t_6) \- Husband does weird stuff while sleep walking and tries to find a cure for it.

Things escalate after that, but it didn't do enough with the concept for me. Ending was weak too. **6/10**

27. [What You Wish For (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13638858/?ref_=rt_t_5) \- Nick Stahl again and this time he's a chef that came to a villa in Latin America to hang out with a friend. Things go very wrong after that and I'm not going to spoil anything else about the plot.

This isn't the most exciting thriller because it's more leisurely paced, which I feel was deliberate to give the feeling of no escape from what is coming, which is hard to stomach.

It was well made and I was never bored throughout it. **6.5-7/10.**

28. [Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079641/?ref_=rt_t_4) \- This is where I'm going to upset some people because I thought this film was terrible and I'm genuinely shocked that it's so well regarded.

I've seen the original and the Eggers remake and in comparison, this feels like a porn parody.

Professional actors give some of the most wooden and laughable performances, like the actor who plays Renfield, who's doing his best Daffy Duck impersonation, and inept direction from Herzog, who seems to improvise scenes on the spot.

The film feels cheap, with weak production values, the cinematography is sometimes good and other times has terrible lighting and there's a lack of atmosphere throughout it.

The scenes in their home town looked like contemporary Netherlands from the 70's and the streets were empty for the most part. There was no attempt to make it look like the period in which it was set in.

At least they went to my country to film the scenes in the village before Harker goes to the castle. **3/10**

29. [The Devils (1971)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066993/?ref_=rt_t_3) \- I follow Mark Kermode, who's been championing this film for ages and tried to get it released on bluray, but apparently Warner Bros. has no intention to do it and I can understand why.

This is one of the most unhinged films I've ever seen. Ken Russell is taking no prisoners here and going balls to the wall.

I can imagine the way it was received back then because the way it presents the church and religion is extremely bold even by today's standards.

There are moments where the film is on the border between art and trash, but it doesn't cross into the latter.

Oliver Reed is extraordinary as the priest and Vanessa Redgrave is great too as the sexually repressed sister.

Add to the fact that it's based on real events and it makes it even more crazy. A must watch and if you can find a bootleg version for the closest thing to the uncut version, that would be ideal. **9/10**

30.[ Sweeney Todd (2007)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408236/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_sweeney%2520todd) \- The only rewatch on the list. It's been over a decade since I've seen it and I thought I'd have some fun on Halloween night after so many heavy films, but I had forgotten just how macabre and mean spirited this one is.

Funnily enough, I rarely get grossed out, but for some reason Ms. Lovett's meat pies made me not enjoy my dinner while I was watching the film. Those things looked disgusting.

I'm not a fan of musicals in general, but this is one that I enjoy. **8/10**

31. [Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022835/?ref_=rt_t_2) \- Fredric March won an Oscar for his dual role and he deserved it.

There's some really impressive camera work for that time in it and the transformation looks good too.

I haven't read the Robert Louis Stevenson novella, so I can't comment how good of an adaptation it is, but I feel like there was more to be done than just turn him into a misogynist when he's Hyde.

For example, Fritz Lang's M came out in the same year and profilers consider it one of the most accurate representations of a psychopath even today, so the period in which it was made couldn't be used as an excuse as to why it was such a simplistic story.

And this was pre-code horror, when they didn't have to worry about censorship. Overall I was left wanting more out of it. **6/10**",5,1762182853.0,horror,8,0.65,False

my daughter is in half-day preschool and my husband works part time; he does half the day with her. i work from home. i feel like i can manage my life well at the moment but there’s zero intentional exercise or self-care and i truly don’t know where it would fit.

i wake up around 6:30 to have coffee and get ready before my daughter wakes up.

7:30-8:30 i get her ready and then drop her off at school, i get back home at 9:15 ish. eat breakfast and start work at 9:30.

my husband works 7:30-12 and picks up our daughter from school. i work until 5:30 with 1 or 2 short breaks depending n the day.

after work i do one of a few things: take my daughter to an activity like dance or music class, make dinner, or spend time with my daughter while my husband makes dinner.

we eat dinner then start bedtime around 7:45 and she’s in bed around 8:30. after her bedtime i typically handle house chores like laundry while my husband cleans up the kitchen from dinner. we then try to spend a little time together watching a show or playing a board game or whatever.

i try to be in bed by 10:30 so i can wake up and do it again the next day.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

# Section 1: What Makes an Espresso Machine Easy to Use?

Many people buy an espresso machine only to discover it’s complicated, messy, or confusing. But not all machines are like that. Let’s start by understanding what makes an espresso machine **truly easy to use**.

# 1.1 Easy-to-Use Means Simplicity + Consistency

An easy machine should:

* Make espresso with just one or two button presses
* Heat up quickly
* Clean up easily
* Give consistent taste every time

If a machine can do these things, it’s beginner-friendly.

# 1.2 Core Features of an Easy Espresso Machine

Here’s a simple table for you:

|**Feature**|**What It Means**|**Why It Matters**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|One-Touch Operation|Just press one button to brew espresso|Saves time, no confusion|
|Fast Heat-Up|Machine is ready within 30–60 seconds|No waiting in the morning|
|Automatic Milk Frother|Froths milk automatically|Perfect cappuccino or latte|
|Built-In Grinder|Grinds coffee automatically|No need for a separate grinder|
|Simple Cleaning System|Self-rinse or removable parts|Keeps machine fresh|
|Consistent Brewing Pressure|Same pressure every time|Better flavor and crema|

# 1.3 Why Ease of Use Matters

* **Saves time:** Busy people need quick coffee.
* **Reduces stress:** Complicated machines frustrate beginners.
* **Improves results:** Fewer mistakes mean better-tasting espresso.
* **Encourages use:** You’ll use it daily if it’s simple.

When a machine checks these five boxes, it’s truly effortless.

# Section 2: How to Choose the Best Easiest-to-Use Espresso Machine

Let’s now learn how to **pick** the right espresso machine that fits your kitchen, budget, and comfort level.

# 2.1 Step 1 – Decide Your Effort Level

Ask yourself:

* Do I want to press a button and get espresso automatically?
* Or do I like doing a few steps manually?

There are three main types of machines:

|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Fully Automatic (Super-Automatic)**|Very Low|Beginners|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**Semi-Automatic**|Medium|People who like a bit of control|⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**Manual (Lever Type)**|High|Skilled users|⭐⭐|

**If you’re a beginner**, always start with a **fully automatic** or **semi-automatic** model.

# 2.2 Step 2 – Look for Smart, Simple Features

When you buy, focus on these **seven simple points**:

|**Feature**|**Ideal Specification**|**Why It’s Important**|
|:-|:-|:-|

|Grinder|Built-in or pre-ground option|Less mess|
|Water Tank|Removable and visible|Easy to refill|
|Cleaning Alert|Light or auto-rinse|Maintenance made easy|
|Size|Compact (fits counter)|Space-saving|

# 2.3 Step 3 – Consider Your Budget

You don’t need the most expensive machine to enjoy espresso. Here’s a basic idea:

|**Budget Range**|**Machine Type**|**Ease Level**|**Example Experience**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$150–$250|Basic Semi-Automatic|Medium|Needs minor learning|
|$300–$500|Entry Super-Automatic|High|One-button coffee|
|$600–$1000|Premium Automatic|Very High|Smart features and cleaning|
|$1000+|Luxury Machines|Extreme|Fully digital with touch screen|

Most home users find the **$300–$600** range perfect for both simplicity and quality.

Before you buy, it’s good to know what real users say.

**Common User Feedback Patterns:**

* “The machine warms up in seconds.”
* “My 10-year-old can make a cappuccino.”
* “Cleaning takes only 2 minutes.”
* “I stopped buying café coffee after getting this.”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I approached her at a coffee shop and we had a great 2 hour long chat. Since then we've been on 5 dates, I've also been out of town for 10 days within that timeframe, so about 5 dates in 33 days. We recently hung out and she explained to me that she wants to see each other less often, like once a week, because she loves her current schedule and wants to take things slow. 

I'm fine with taking things slow, seeing each other once a week, but the problem I'm facing is that she is such a bad texter if we're not making plans. She can go many days without texting me, and it makes me feel unwanted, but then when we plan a date she is very responsive, on the date she is also extremely present and focused. 

I think we like each other, and we cuddle and kiss and it feels intimate. I've definitely been getting strong feelings for her.

She's definitely more avoidant, and I'm more anxious. If she texted me more frequently it would offer me assurance and make me less anxious. Perhaps I should bring this up to her. 

At the same time, we're still both on dating apps, and recently a woman has been texting with me and she is so quick to respond. But I really like the woman I've been seeing.

Fortunately, no anaphylaxis, hives, or indications of a potential emergency allergic reaction.

I started Cromolyn ampules almost a month ago. I was a told to titrate up, 1 ampule per week (to 4) - and some folks in this community said to go slower if needed. I was feeling OK after a few days and anxious for more improvement so I increased to 2 (too soon, I know, I suck but really just wanted to feel better). Had a huge adrenaline dump the 2nd day doing that, it was AWFUL. 

After that, doc said go back to 1 for a bit to re-stabilize, which I did. I just tried going back up to 2 again on Friday. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night were rough. Palipitations, nausea, vertigo and dizziness, constantly feeling just on the verge of a massive adrenaline dump but not quite there. Didn't get hardly any sleep, and woke up each day in a panic. The symptoms last until mid-day the following day, I feel so on edge.

So I'm trying to figure out is this a side effect of the 2nd ampule, and if so will it pass if I stay with it for a few more days, or do I need to decrease again?  I'm taking one dose before lunch and one before dinner; I am too sick in the morning to eat and digest breakfast (this is a permanent problem, not a Cromolyn induced one) so I don't take any in the morning. Breakfast is coffee and Zyrtec (aka MCAS and long COVID version of coffee and a cigarette).

I get up at 6am, I make breakfast for husband and toddler, pack toddlers lunch and diaper bag for the sitter, get her dressed and ready for the day. I take her to the truck and buckle her into her carseat, hugs and kisses and off they go for 730am. 

I tidy up and make myself a coffee shortly after and basically stare into the abyss until 850am when I clock in for work. 

I work a minimum of 8 hours, often longer if I get stuck on a call. 

I get off *in theory* at 530pm, more often 630 or later. 

Then I go straight downstairs from my office to the kitchen and start prepping/cooking supper. Serve that as soon as I can, usually 630-7 depending on when I'm actually done work and what I'm cooking. 

When everyone's done, I clean that up and deal with leftovers. Usually by then it's nearly 8pm and I take the toddler for bedtime. 

Whole process takes around an hour from start to finish to get her into her crib. 

By the time I get to actually sit down and take a breath, it's at least 9pm. 

I have no time for anything outside of the daily bullshit I have to do. By 9pm I'm too damn tired to focus on a hobby or a video game. I usually end up just laying on the couch and half watching TV until 1030/11 before I finally give up and pass out. 

I don't feel like a person at all, just a pile of chores and daily tasks that need to be done. I have no hobbies, no interests, no real friends, no social life what so ever. Hell I have to plan IN ADVANCE if I even want to take a long bath! I've been complaining for days that I feel like shit because I'm having a rough period this cycle and I still can't get any damn down time. 

I don't even think I know what I even like anymore ffs. I just exist and work non-stop.",6,1762182203.0,breakingmom,6,1.0,False
1one2n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1one2n6/tldr_built_a_bt_remote_to_autoskip_ads_in/,"TL;DR: Built a BT remote to auto-skip ads in YouTube/podcasts without touching your phone—eyes closed, no light/movement. Game-changer for sleep hygiene.","As a former insomniac who's finally got my sleep hygiene dialed in, I wanted to share something that's become an absolute game-changer for my routine. I built a product for myself, I scratched my own itch. Like many of you, I rely on YouTube videos or podcasts as background noise to wind down—it's like a modern lullaby that quiets my racing thoughts and eases me into sleep. I just love the recommendation engine, and there is always something there interesting enough but not too interesting to be stimulating. Since ad blocking has been blocked, ads popping up shatter that calm: I'd have to fumble for my phone in the dark, expose myself to bright screens, and physically move from my comfy position just to skip them. That unavoidable light and disruption during sleep onset latency? Total killer for ramping down to actual rest.

Enter SemiPremium, a little hardware device I built specifically to solve this. It's a Bluetooth remote that automates ad skipping (or time-skipping in podcasts) with the press of a button—literally. No apps, no subscriptions, just seamless HID simulation that keeps the flow going. For anyone practicing good sleep hygiene but still using audio/video to fall asleep, it's essential. It eliminates that forced physical movement and light exposure, letting you stay in bed, eyes closed, and drift off uninterrupted. Skip ads and fast forward over ad segments in both videos and podcasts, without moving and with closed eyes.

Due to my previous almost terminal sleep onset insomnia which was solved not by SemiPremium, but through a series of efforts which is mostly behavioral interventions and habit systems with CBT-I playing a huge part for a series of initial positive experiences, I am and have become hypersensitive to any form of external influence or unexpected sensory stimuli during sleep onset latency. I usually start the day by beginning to go to bed, 16 hours later in the day. It starts with a Sanolux lamp tilted in my face for 10-15 minutes while squinting and sometimes sneezing, to achor my circadian rhythm. That is the first thing I do when I wake up. When I have done everything right until bedtime, I clearly notice spikes, both increases in alertness and wakefulness and keep track of any disruptive elements for continuous mitigation or removal through behavioral interventions. Using the phone in bed is one of them, but at the same time - nothing is better than it. I don't like monotonous and the same, I crave variation and something interesting enough to hook my attention to and YouTube is perfect for that. But light exposure is a no-go, and this over the years has become a unavoidable guilty pleasure. Using the phone for background entertainment reduces my sleep onset latency, compared to quiet or a white noise machine. What happens when an ad starts is that my sympathetic nervous system is activated, and the longer the ad and the more annoying it is, the more frustrated I get, then the frustration turns to mild anger, with noises and changes in volume which is not the chosen stimuli, the chosen tonality or pitch or expected context, and the more wake and alert I become - especially when I get a 40 minute infomercial with guitar lessons as a part of my chosen video to doze off to, and HAD to move to press skip. 

If this sounds familiar, check out the demo videos on my Tindie store. Just search for SemiPremium on Tindie or ""SemiPremium - iOS demo or SemiPremium - Android demo"" on YouTube. They've got real-world examples of how it works with YouTube and podcasts. Would love to hear if others here deal with the same ad-interruption frustration—any tips or similar hacks you've found?

I'm curious to hear feedback and if the solution is a good fit for the problem. I am the founder and inventor, I did the product design, architected the system, designed the workflow and wrote the firmware, took me a few months, and now in the process of daily testing. I am also in the process of getting this product out there, and have kept it secret and stayed in stealth mode, and gradually realized that the problem being solved actually is a global health problem with hundreds of millions of daily active users indulging in the same habit, where 10 % has Premium. A lot of harm is caused by this habit, and I am building an alternative so there is an option other than subscribing to Premium, and also for those who pay for Premium and still have to suffer through the in-content ad-reads by the creators. During the daytime, I have no issues with it, but during the night, when ad frequency for skippable ads are ramped up to drive Premium-subscription conversion through disruption of people sleep and pure annoyance, I do have a big problem with that. 

Sleep is fragile, and people don't get enough of it. Society is blind to the detrimental effects of technological disruption of the number one most important element of physical and mental health - sleep. Enough of it, and good quality. For those where it is extra fragile, an interruption while being close to sleep onset can result in no sleep the entire night, going to work the next day and paying the price of sleep deprivation for days. 

The phone is used in bed by the majority of the population in the western hemisphere. Sleep experts and scientists say the phone should not be in the bedroom, but it is and will be for the foreseeable future. So what causes interactions with the device, and can those interactions be done with something else than a photon emitting primary navigation interface (touch-screen) through a thing with tactile buttons where you feel the button icon so no vision is required to operate it? It seems like it can, for controlling background entertainment such as YouTube or podcasts. 

Social media is a different animal, and people who are using social media in bed, I think, has no right to complain about lack of sleep, bad sleep or taking too long to fall asleep. It is almost like having a cup of coffee before sleep and wondering why it doesn't happen. What I do get is why people do it, and that is absence of thinking while doing it. Being entertained, but in this setting the dosage is too high. There are better sorts of entertainment out there, and you don't want to interact with an algorithm communication with you through a handheld audiovisual rectangle with superpowers andone goal in mind... To ding-ding-ding in your dopaminergic system and fire up your reward circuitry to max, keep you engaged and increase the session time; before that person close their eyes and expect the adenosine to singlehandedly do the job for both the pineal gland and squirt out some melatonin while magically activating the parasympathetic nervous system in a few minutes. That requires darkness for a while before going to sleep, relaxation with reduced or absence of stimulating sensory input and exposure to lots of LUX as soon as possible after getting up the same day. Adenosine (increases with waking hours) + melatonin (increases in darkness) + parasympathetic nervous system activation (increases with relaxation and absence of both physical and digital stimulation). Those are the three most important factors in facilitating sleep onset transition. 

For this reason, I chose not to include functions for scrolling up and down in social media, although it could potentially be lucrative. Then get a CheerTok. SemiPremium is a sleep onset facilitation device, or a sleep onset acceleration device in system speak. It eliminates movement and light, while preserving the possibility to use the phone as a modern lullaby. 

  
I derive great pleasure from being able to solve this for other insomniacs and people suffering from sleep disorders or disturbances. Being forced and spoon fed ads in the sanctuary, the bed. After all the tasks for the day has been completed, no more things to do, no more effort required - no more movements. Just rest until it happens, and then the next thing is the next day. No demands, and whatever is on the to-do-list has to wait until the next day. But just get Premium has become an argument people actually use when describing this problem. I think more people would be Premium-subscribers it the conversion funnel wasn't driven be moments of pulling out hair and being annoyed at the exactly wrong time at night and having to get up on the elbow, get the eyes to adjust to the brightness which hasn't been turned down, then finding the little button and missing it while pointing and using a touch interface through the shoulder, elbow, wrist and finally finger, and accidentally opening the ad-page for the advertiser, having to relocate the finger to press the little x, then actually hitting the skip button, putting the phone back where it belongs and getting back to rest, head back on the pillow. But now wide awake, again. In the process there, somewhere, people grab their credit card and just fill it in. Finally some rest. And then, finally, problem solved..? Then the new favorite channel has a creator who embeds four 2 minute ad-read segments in the 45-minute videos. Then asking the question.... But I pay for Premium. Then thinking, Oh, so it was just that one type of ad, not the other?

So, I’m Anton. Nice to digitally bump into you. I’m a backend developer (which is basically the IT equivalent of being the bass player in a garage band — you never see me, but if I stop playing, everything falls apart).

I also happen to have cerebral palsy. Which means my motor skills are jazz improv at best, but my brain? Still cooking at 100°C, baby.

Now, let’s get real. My content breakdown looks something like this:

* 90%: brutally honest life stuff with CP — no inspirational violin soundtrack, just the raw, sometimes hilarious reality.
* 5%: techy ramblings about backend development and machine learning — for those who get excited over elegant REST APIs and well-behaved models.
* 5%: completely random chaos — probably about cats, coffee, or the absurdity of existence.

I recently lost my job (yay capitalism!) and decided to channel my unhinged energy into Patreon. Here’s the kicker though — I’m not selling anything. No tutorials, no “build your SaaS in 10 days” clickbait, no digital trinkets. Just… me. My words. My experience. My view from this weird, glitched-out human experience.

So here’s where I need your collective Reddit brainpower:  
**What the heck can I actually** ***offer*** **patrons that would make them go, “Yeah, I’ll throw a coin to this disabled tech wizard”?**  
And once I figure that out — how the hell do I promote this without turning into a walking LinkedIn post with #hustle vibes?

Appreciate any ideas, no matter how wild. (Okay maybe not OnlyFans)

Thanks, you beautiful chaotic humans.

1ondwrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ondwrr/the_heart_tree_part_1/,THE HEART TREE - Part 1,"""You alright, Jake?"" I asked. 

I found Jake standing by the kitchen sink with his fingers digging into his scalp. This wasn't the first time I had seen him get worked up, but it was unusual for him to get this way during a house party - I had known Jake long enough that I could set my watch to when one of his screaming panic attacks would follow the day after a big social event. So whatever it was that was causing Jake such intense stress was beyond the normal self-loathing he felt as a consequence of performing as the life of the party, which some part of himself must have felt deeply compelled to do.  

""Ian,"" said Jake, looking at me as if he had just found the solution to his problem. 

He noticed me noticing the blood under his fingernails. Muttering to himself, he turned on his heel and washed his hands at the sink. 

His hands washed, he cleared his throat and turned back to face me and smiled his signature 'everything's great' smile that had no real authenticity behind it. 

""Mate,"" I said, ""What's wrong? Has something happened?"" 

Jake's eyes shot to the left, then flitted back to me. 

""I can't talk about it here,"" he said in a whisper, ""I was getting Phillip a glass of water. I'll meet you in the upstairs bathroom in a minute, okay?"" 

After I gave a slow nod to affirm that I would, Jake finished filling a glass with cold tap water and hurried back to the adjacent living room where the party was in full swing. 

I made my way upstairs, and entered the bathroom, closing the door until it was slightly ajar. 

There was slippery sweat under my armpits, and my eyes felt slightly swollen in the dark  and warm confines of the bathroom. 

I felt on edge, and overwhelmed. All I wanted to do was retreat to my bedroom at the other end of the hallway and spend the rest of the night on my own. 

With nothing but the darkness and the muffled cacophony of laughter and music rising up through the house from the downstairs living room, my thoughts began to wander. 

It had only been a week since I had returned to my university house accommodation at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and the recent events of Christmas back home in South-East London were playing on my mind. Other than spending Christmas with my family, which was always a highlight of the year, I also had an unexpected catch up with my former best friend Ewan. 

And it was the thought of Ewan, and our last encounter, that had prompted me to offer to host the house party for my university friends. Besides Jake, Ellie, and Mark, the other 'friends' of mine that were currently partying downstairs were hardly more than friendly acquaintances, who I either knew because I lived with them at my current accommodation, or because they were part of the university's board game society which I had joined in my third year. 

Ewan wasn't one of the friends at the party. He was a friend from back home who I had known since around the end of secondary school, and all throughout Sixth Form college. 

Three years ago, just before I left home for university at the relatively late age of twenty-one, Ewan had told me about his plan to go to China in order to become an English teacher there. 

I remembered asking him how long he intended to go to China for. He told me: three years. 

*Don't do that*, I had said to him, *you'll become a robot*. *You can't just up and go and leave your friends and family like that. Besides, is China really the best place you could go?*

But Ewan had made his mind up.

We hadn't spoken again until he came back to England to visit his family over the Christmas holidays that had just come and gone. Ewan had reached out and messaged me, offering to meet up and hang out, and I had jumped at the offer. 

When I saw Ewan for the first time since he had left for China, he was noticeably fatter. 

He had always been short but stocky, and because of that he had played rugby throughout his teens (which subsequently had riddled his back with unfixable spinal injuries that left him in constant mild discomfort.) But when we had met at a local restaurant, and he had waddled inside, he was noticeably overweight without any athletic stockiness to compensate. 

That had been the first sign something was majorly wrong with him. 

After an awkward hug, he joined me at the table. And then, bit by bit, he told me what had happened to him during his stay in China. 

I remembered complaining to my Mum, the only person who I could really talk to about this sort of thing back home, about all the things Ewan had told me. 

""He almost died,"" I had said to Mum, ""Because the air in China is so polluted, he ended up getting a blood clot in his nose. He got rushed to the hospital and the doctors had to take out a clot the size of a slug out of his nose.""

Mum hadn't enjoyed the grizzly details. 

""And,"" I had said, ""Because the doctors had to remove the blood clot, Ewan's completely lost his sense of smell, and he can barely breathe through his nose. The slightest bit of dust in the air anywhere he goes is unbearable for him now."" 

I had walked around with Ewan after the dinner, and any time we stopped at a bench to sit down, he would become agitated, and would sniff and twitch, and he would eventually admit defeat and we would need to carry on our way. And during all this he would bend his back to pop and crack his spine to get some relief. And between each stop and start I had to walk much slower to compensate for his congested waddling pace.

And not once during the whole conversation during our day hanging out together did he admit or make any sign of regretting having gone to China. 

Not even after having to leave behind the cat he had spent three years treating as family, only for that same cat to be abandoned by the owners whose care Ewan had entrusted it in. His Chinese girlfriend who he met at the university where he taught English had given his cat to her parents, who had promptly abandoned the cat to the streets and lied about doing so whenever the topic was brought up during phone calls.) 

That meeting with Ewan had been our friendship on fumes, and more of a reunion in honor of the good friends we once were.

*But him leaving for China hadn't been what had ended the real friendship, had it?* I thought, still sitting in the dark of the upstairs bathroom with my brooding thoughts.

*The friendship ended because he got sick of me,* I thought. 

He had said as much during our latest hang out. 

He had mentioned how he had a full week of catching up with other friends from school, all of whom I had never managed to befriend myself. 

""It's funny,"" I had said to Ewan, ""How you have so many other friends and I never got to know them.""

I had said this in a somewhat whimsical way, because I knew how much of a social outcast I had been throughout most of my school life.

""I guess people don't like feeling like they're being judged,"" Ewan had said in response. 

And that comment, more than anything else Ewan had said, had really been the final nail in the coffin for our friendship. 

It wasn't because I had noticed the self-importance with which he had made that comment. Ewan had always had an easy time making and keeping friends at school. He did so by playing the clown, and otherwise being blandly affable in any social situation. Something I knew he didn't like about himself because he had told me so. Our friendship had seemed unique in comparison, because when we talked, back in the early years of our friendship, it was hard for us to stop talking about life, the universe, and everything. 

What pissed me off about Ewan's comment was the dismissal of the idea that *judging* in and of itself was wrong. That, because I had my own point of view that differed from his that I was somehow the *judgemental one.* 

*Because I care about you?* I had thought, *Because I give a shit enough about you to try and stop you from making mistakes you'll regret for the rest of your life?* 

I imagined myself saying\*, If you had listened to me you wouldn't have had that blood cot, you wouldn't have to abandon that cat, and you wouldn't have to order the absolute hottest possible curry your local Indian takeaway because you can't taste anything with a Scoville score less than three-hundred-thousand.\* 

But I had bit my tongue and kept things as polite as I could manage, because I had figured out that as far as Ewan was concerned, my advice was worthless. 

Jake was the closest friend I had made since Ewan. 

We had met during our first year at University because we shared the same campus accommodation. Separate rooms, but the same shared living space. 

Jake was his own can of worms, perhaps more riddled with problems than Ewan. 

Jake's light thumping footsteps met my ears above the unbroken sound of laughter and shouting from the others downstairs. 

""Hello?"" said Jake.

His smiling face emerged at the ajar doorway. 

""Hey,"" I whispered.

Jake moved in, brushed by me, and moved over to the toilet. He set the lid down and sat.

""Mate, what's wrong?"" I said in a whisper.

""I can't say,"" said Jake.

""You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, mate,"" I said, ""I just want to know if you're in any kind of trouble.""

""No, it's not like that,"" said Jake, pitifully, ""It's…it's just…ugh, I can't say.""

My cheeks were fuzzy from the two large cans of energy drink I had imbibed and followed up with two regular bottles of vodka-and-lemonade. The alcohol content from the vodka-and-lemonade was so minimal there was no chance that I was drunk. But considering I rarely drank, and was therefore a major lightweight when it came to alcohol, I still felt noticeably tipsy.

Jake on the other hand had finished half a bottle of vodka on his own, and had shown very little sign of slowing down.

""Ugh,"" Jake groaned, ""I think I'm going to have a panic attack.""

""Is there anything I can do?"" I said.

Jake shook his head slowly from side to side. Muffled laughter rose and fell again from downstairs.

""Sounds like they're having fun,"" I said.

Two things happened then.

The first, was Jake began to let out an increasingly agonised whine that would soon become uncontrolled sobbing.

The second, was the sudden all-at-once arrival of a golden light so bright the only thing I thought it could be was the beginning of a nuclear bomb blast.

I had checked my phone a few minutes prior to inviting Jake to go upstairs to the bathroom with me to talk, and it had been close to 9PM around that time. It had gotten dark around 4PM, and we weren't on the side of the house which would have streetlights shining in from outside.

The new light pouring in from the bathroom window was brighter than peak daylight to the point I had to look away and shield my eyes.

Screams from the others downstairs broke out too.

And then just as Jake's sobbing reached its peak, a sound, like an explosion, reached my ears.

And it was so loud I was certain it was a bomb. It had to be. What else could make such noise? It drowned every other sound out and made it impossible to think of anything else.

Unable to see anything but bright burning gold light, and ears pierced with the catastrophically thunderous and unrelenting noise; I wondered if this was how I was going to die.

If it was a nuclear bomb, or some similar doomsday device unleashed on the populace of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England, the shockwave blast hadn't yet reached us.

One second passed after another and still the near blinding gold light and the terrible noise like thousands of drums being played right outside the house continued.

I had already pocketed my phone into my right jeans pocket, which left me with my hands free to stuff my index fingers into my ears to muffle some of the painful thundering.

The sheer unfamiliarity of what was happening had forced Jake out of his panic attack. He had his hands to his ears and his face was squinting and bathed in gold as he shouted something at me that I couldn't hear. At a guess I figured he was shouting my name.

As much as it hurt to do so, I removed the finger from my left ear and pulled down the bathroom door handle. The second I had the door open I put the finger right back because it felt as if a screwdriver were being dug into my ear canal during that brief lapse.

I inched out of the bathroom and made sure Jake was following me before continuing on. With me leading, we both inched our way down the stairs.

The house hallway was similarly bathed in gold from the biblical levels of light.

Is the house going to catch fire? I wondered.

The light was hot, like standing outside during a heatwave, which only worsened my fears that I was right – that there really had been a nuclear bomb that had gone off.

But it had been maybe thirty seconds since the light and noise had started. Would it take that long for the nuclear bomb's shockwave to reach us? And wouldn't the radiation from the light cook us all alive way before the final destructive force?

Afterimages, like negative coloured splotches, hovered over my field of vision. Even with my eyelids closed for as long as I dared to keep them shut whilst continuing down the hallway, it felt as if I had many hot lightbulbs shining in front of my face.

I reached the living room at the back of the house and saw the bulk of the others standing near the sliding glass door. There were more than a dozen of them standing there, the light making them like scorched silhouettes.

And then all at once the light stopped, as if a switch had been flicked. My vision went dark, and the splotches in front of my eyes continued to bob and roam and block me from making out much of anything around me.

Several seconds later the thundering noise stopped too. In its absence was silence pierced by a continuing shriek that I was sure was the aftermath of my eardrums suffering such brutal noise for so long, and not an actual sound to be heard.

Over the course of a few minutes the best I could do was remain off to one side of the room hoping that I wasn't going to be near deaf and blind for the rest of my life.

My hearing normalised first. The panicked crying and whimpers from some of the others in the living room met my ears. And soon after my vision adjusted to the darkness of the room, which was lit by a dim bulb light hanging from the ceiling.

I knew, because I was the one hosting the house party, that there were fifteen of us including myself in the house.

""It's a nuclear bomb!"" someone shouted.

It was Tyler.

He was very tall and gangly, with long sandy-blonde hair tied back into a ponytail. The most distinctive items Tyler had worn for this evening were white and red-striped arm warmers that matched with his red and white converse shoes, on top of his overall effeminate grunge style.

""If it's a nuclear bomb the shockwave would have hit us by now,"" I said.

""I bet you France is cooked!"" said someone else.

It was Jack. About as tall as me at five foot seven. Unlike me, he was Pakistani-Asian, whereas I was White-British.

Also like me, Jack wasn't dressed effeminately, only three other guys at the party liked to dress in a girl-ish way, and neither Jack nor I were one of them. Instead I was dressed in a button down checkered shirt and blue jeans, and Jack in a simple dark green shirt and blue jeans.

""What do you mean?"" I said.

""Isn't it obvious?"" said Jack, ""France just got bombed and that was the blast!""

""There's no way,"" came a monotone voice.

It was Ben, the other tall guy of the group. Dressed in a shabby hoodie and blue jeans, with messy short hair.

""If it was a nuclear bomb we'd all be dead.""

""So what was it?"" said Jake.

He was standing close to me, and his face, no longer bathed in gold from the light, nor the darkness from the bathroom, was instead a natural bronze from his Malaysian heritage. His scrawny body was clad in tight blue jeans and a bright pink sweater with an anime-style teddy bear depicted across the chest.

Nobody had an answer. Over on the leather couch against the rear wall two of the girls, Georgia and Megan, were sitting and holding each other's hands for support.

I found myself grinning despite the horrible pit of dread gnawing in my stomach, perhaps because this was by far the most exciting thing to ever happen in my life.

""Maybe it's an alien invasion,"" I said, half-joking.

""Ian, that ain't funny,"" said another voice.

I saw Jake whip round to look at him first. Standing at the doorway, blocking most of it with his bulk, was Mark. He was about the same height as me, but much broader on account of his dedication in the last half year or so lifting weights and eating the right foods to bulk up. He did, however, look like he had just wandered out of his bedroom because he was wearing a simple tan t-shirt and brown three-quarter-length shorts, and he was wearing his usual dorky sandals.

""Maybe it was a solar flare,"" came another voice.

Over on the couch, next to Megan, his girlfriend, was Eddie. He was a bit shorter than me, with a square-ish head and his frame drowned in an oversized hoodie. I couldn't remember what it was he was currently studying at university, but I knew it was something that required a lot of brains.

""If it was a solar flare all our phones wouldn't be working,"" said Georgia.

She was a very rotund girl with a head of long curly hair, and she also happened to be Tyler's girlfriend. Her eyes were wide open, as if she were on drugs. Her hands, still holding onto Megan's, were trembling.

Because of Georgia mentioning our phones, everyone in the room retrieved their phones to take a look. The light from all the screens filled the dimly lit living space some more.

""My phone's still working but I don't have internet,"" said Jack next to me with his phone in his hand.

Tyler let out an aggravated rasp.

""Yeah I got no internet either,"" he said.

Several of the others in the room mumbled they also had no internet on their phones. I checked my phone and, like the rest, I didn't have any internet.

""Maybe we should check outside?"" came another voice.

It was Dave, Mark's younger brother. He looked a lot like Mark except a year or so younger and without any of the benefit of having lifted weights.

""No, you're not going outside,"" said Mark, in a way that left no room for debate.

Dave listened to his brother without further rebuttal.

""So it wasn't a solar flare, probably,"" I said, ""Because the lights are still on and our phones are still working. And it wasn't a–""

I had to stop speaking to swallow, my mouth feeling incredibly parched all of a sudden, and the fear which gripped me was making it hard to catch my breath.

""--and,"" I said, once I took a moment to breathe, ""it wasn't a nuclear blast because we're all still alive. Even if it hit France or wherever I bet we'd all be dead right now.""

""What if it was something stupid?"" said Phillip from a chair in the corner of the room. Philip, like Jake, was very scrawny and even more effeminate in his mannerisms. Unlike Jake, he was also mixed-raced African.

""Like,"" he said, ""What if it was like a big firework or something?""

""That wasn't a firework,"" said Ben.

""Then what was it?"" said Georgia, and then she pointed at me, ""And don't say aliens.""

I threw my hands up mock guiltily to help lighten the serious mood. This earned a few forced laughs from some of the others in the room, if only so they could let themselves feel something other than terrible dread about whatever had happened, and perhaps was still happening.

""I don't have any signal,"" said another boy who was sitting in the large green leather armchair in the corner of the room, adjacent to where Megan and Georgia were sitting together.

It was Oscar, a portly boy with a head of balding hair despite being only around eighteen years of age.

""I don't think we can even call the police,"" he said.

Besides Oscar, was Gary, who, out of everyone in the room, seemed to be paying the least amount of attention to what had just happened. Instead, as was typical for him, he had a beer can in his hand which he contentedly drank from until the can was empty. And then he promptly started on what was likely his tenth (conservatively speaking) can of beer for the evening (any morning or afternoon drinks he might have had not included.)

I decided to walk over to the sliding glass door which, were I to open it, led to the back garden. I saw my reflection in the glass and some of the faces of the others watching me from over by the couches around the coffee table (which was swamped in both opened and unopened bottles and cans of alcohol, with plenty of mixers too.)

The living room was humid, sweaty, and stunk of alcohol. What I wanted was fresh air, but I didn't dare open the sliding glass door yet.

Instead I raised my phone to the glass and used the phone's torchlight function to see further into the veil of darkness.

Out in the back garden was the large leafless tree which must have been there for decades. Besides the tree I could see the patchy garden grass, and thorny bushes, but nothing out of the ordinary.

""Do you see anything?"" said Mark from the doorway on the other side of the room.

""Nothing abnormal,"" I said.

I put my hand on the glass, and it was then I noticed I had spoken too soon.

Something was falling in heaps outside.

Because I was shining the torchlight the others caught a glimpse of the same falling stuff before I could call it out.

Some of the guys raced to the sliding glass door and peered out, using the torchlight functions of their phones to add to mine to see what was happening outside.

""Is it ash?"" said Jack.

""It looks like ash,"" said Ben, ""But it's not.""

""How do you know?"" I said.

""Because if it was ash everything would be on fire outside,"" said Ben.

""Let's open the door and we'll be able to tell,"" said Philip.

He reached for the sliding door latch. Right away myself, Ben, and Tyler took hold of Philip's arms to stop him.

""Okay! Okay! Get off me! GET OFF!"" Philip shouted.

""Don't open the door,"" said Ben, keeping his grip on Philip like iron.

There wasn't anything personal about the way Ben said this in his usual monotone voice. But he was panicking like the rest of us.

""I won't, get off,"" said Philip.

Ben let him go, and so did the rest of us who had taken hold of Philip – for his protection and our own.

""The air could be poisoned,"" said Jack, ""We better not risk it.""

""Is everyone okay?"" came a new voice.

It was Ellie. She was one of my housemates, and had simply been doing her own thing in her room when all the commotion began. She had her usual glasses on, and was in her pajamas.

""We're okay,"" I said, ""We're just trying to figure out what all of that even was.""

""It was mad, init?"" said Ellie, ""I nearly shat myself when it started.""

What she just said earned another round of nervous laughter from most of the people in the room.

""D'you think it was thunder and lightning?"" said Ellie.

""Maybe,"" said another voice.

This time it was Megan. Her voice was quivering from stress. Her hands gripping hold of Georgia's just as much as Georgia was gripping hers.

""It started with just light,"" said Megan, freeing one of her hands to adjust her glasses, only to put her hand right back to firmly gripping Georgia's again, ""And then the light came a few seconds later. Just like thunder and lightning. But way bigger.""

It was then I noticed the white puff of air leaving my mouth. The day had started cool, but not cold. And even over the recent Christmas period it hadn't been cold enough to be more than chilly.

Everyone in rapid succession noticed their breaths catching in the air too. Not only that, we could all feel the temperature dropping.

A cracking noise began to fill the air, and it was then those of us closest to the sliding glass door noticed frost climbing all over the glass.

I placed my hand against the glass and immediately noticed how cold it was.

""How is it getting so cold?"" said Philip, ""The glass is frosting up!""

Ellie joined those of us who were standing at the sliding glass door.

""This is bad,"" she said, ""The temperature shouldn't be dropping like this.""

It was strange seeing genuine fear from Ellie. It simply wasn't an emotion I had ever seen from her, besides one time I pulled a particularly good prank on her. She was, perhaps second only to Jake or Mark, the person I was closest to in the whole house.

""Oh gosh,"" said Jake, suddenly.

He began to race to the doorway where Mark was standing off to the side from where he had moved to let Ellie in.

""Jake, where are you going?"" I said.

""Rebecca,"" said Jake, ""She's still in her room. I'm going to check on her.""

Jake didn't wait for a response. Philip, his best friend since they were little, hurried after him. I decided to stay where I was.

I began to shiver, my teeth chattering. I wasn't dressed at all for the cold. What sweaty humidity had been in the room before was gone.

It was then Gary rose from his spot on one of the couches and, with a beer in his hand, he raised a toast to everyone.

""Well,"" he said, in his usual slurred speech, ""If this is the end of the world, at least it's going down at a party. Cheers!""

He chugged the entirety of the beer, dropped the can to the carpet, and crushed it underfoot.

""Hey!"" I shouted, ""Don't mess up my carpet!""

Gary looked both genuinely shocked at realising the bad of what he had just done, but also as if he were only half-awake.

""Sorry, sorry,"" he slurred, ""I won't do it again, I'm very sorry.""

I took a deep breath, which felt crisp and cold as if I had minty chewing gum in my mouth.

""It's fine,"" I said, ""Just be respectful, mate. Any damages me and the rest of the housemates are going to have to pay for it.""

""Come here, it's alright,"" Gary slurred.

He stepped closer and embraced me in a hug. He reeked of booze and cigarettes; two smells which immediately brought my Dad to mind. I patted Gary on the back a few times to let him know there were no hard feelings, and eased away from him.

""Piss it!"" someone shouted from the kitchen.

It was Mark.

Most of the others in the living room were busy checking their phones, trying to get any signal to make contact with the wider world. Others continued to peer out to the garden, where the newly falling snow – that had to be what it was – was falling with entrancing Yuletide heaviness.

Which left just Ellie, Jack, and me, as the ones who hurried out of the living room at a brisk walking pace into the adjacent kitchen, which was just to the left down the hallway.

Ellie was the first to enter, followed by me, and then Jack behind me. We arrived just in time to see Mark cursing several times as he wound the top hung windows shut using the hand levers.

Even from the other side of the kitchen, which was about three-to-four strides in width, the cold blowing in from the windows was like pain in aerosol form.

Mark shoved his hands under his armpits to get them warm, his face winced in pain.

""You okay?"" said Ellie.

""Yeah, great,"" said Mark, sarcastically.

Then Ellie gasped. Before I could ask why she took a small piece of white plastic away from where it was set on the lime-green kitchen wall. It was a piece of plastic I had never cared to notice before.

""It's below zero degrees centigrade in the house,"" said Ellie, both amazed and panicked.

""How cold is it exactly?"" said Mark.

""This thermometer doesn't go lower than zero,"" said Ellie.

""You know what?"" said Jack from behind me.

The rest of us looked over to him.

""What if this is like in Millennium Warcry?"" He said, ""In the Millennium Warcry books there are these portals – warp gates – that open up. They require a vast amount of energy to open. They can make the weather go haywire.""

""So aliens after all, then?"" I said.

Jack, like Ellie, also looked both panicked and excited.

""It'd be more like interdimensional space demons,"" said Jack, ""Though to use Warp Energy usually requires mass sacrifice of millions of innocent souls.""

""Well,"" I said, ""We'll add that to the list of possibilities.""

""Hey, I'm just saying, it could be,"" said Jack.

""Yeah, yeah,"" I said, ""There's just a bit of a gap between a solar flare or nuclear bomb, compared to, you know, interdimensional hell demons. But hey, if you're right, I'll give you five quid.""

""Really?"" said Jack, ""How about twenty?""

I shrugged.

""Deal,"" I said.

We shook hands on it. This was fine with me, I didn't expect interdimensional hell demons to be the likely cause, but I did want to keep the mood among everyone in the house light-hearted.

""You know, it could be global warming?"" said Dave, who was peering in from the doorway.

""It's not global warming you idiot,"" said Mark.

""Okay,"" said Dave, ""Just thought it might be. Makes more sense than a sodding Warp Gate. No offense, Jack.""

""Hah,"" Jack laughed, ""It's cool.""

""Crap,"" I said.

I'd just realised something.

""Ian?"" said Ellie.

I turned to her and Mark.

""Can you both make sure everything is sealed inside the kitchen and living room? No air gaps to let the cold in? If it gets any colder we're all going to be in serious trouble.""

""Yeah,"" said Mark.

""Yeah, good idea,"" said Ellie.

""Good,"" I said, ""I'll make sure upstairs doesn't have any obvious gaps.""

""Erm,"" said Dave, from the doorway again, ""Maybe we should get blankets and stuff for people down here? It's cold.""

""We know it's cold,"" said Mark, ""But yeah, good idea. We'll see to that after.""

It was hard not to notice how happy Dave looked to receive a positive affirmation from his brother for a change. I felt a little relieved about it too.

Mark and Ellie, joined by Jack and Dave, set to work making sure any and all ways for the cold to get into the house from the ground floor was blocked.

With that being handled, I hurried upstairs to do the same for the other rooms. I had hoped the motion of running up the stairs would have warmed me up some, instead it made me that much more aware of how not dressed for the cold I was.

Alone after reaching the top of the stairs, without the warmth of the others around me, the whole situation seemed far bleaker and scarier. Goosebumps spread over my arms, and my socked feet were numbing from the cold.

Before I could reach my room, which was the room at the far end of the hallway from the stairs, I stopped at the doorway adjacent to my room – which was Rebecca's bedroom.

Inside the room were Jake and Philip, who were kneeling on the ground with Rebecca who was sitting like an overweight panda wearing a pink onesie between them.

And it was then I noticed Jake was busy trying to pull a loosened noose cord away from Rebecca's neck. Her neck, which looked raw and bruised from the cord already having dug hard around her throat.

Rebecca's eyes were open but also downturned, as if she were close to falling asleep. For several surreal moments I simply stood and stared at Rebecca – because I couldn't see if she was breathing.

Finally, I noticed the rise and fall of her chest, and then several hampered coughs escaping her.

I looked around the hallway to see if anyone else might have followed me up the stairs. It was a needless gesture, but I did it anyway just to be sure.

I then moved into Rebecca's bedroom.

Again, I couldn't find the words to ask what had happened, and was happening with Rebecca.

The three of them took notice of me.

""It's okay,"" said Jake, ""Rebecca just had an accident.""

""Accident?"" I said in a whisper.

There was an accusation in my tone because, right there above Rebecca's head where she was sitting, was the noose cord tied to the doorknob of her wardrobe.

Jake finished removing the noose from around Rebecca's neck, and from the wardrobe doorknob.

""Stay with her?"" said Jake, to Philip.

""Don't go,"" Rebecca whined in a tiny voice.

""I'll be right back,"" said Jake.

He patted Rebecca's thigh and then stood quickly and hurried over to the bedroom doorway.

""Want to go to my room?"" I whispered.

""Yeah,"" said Jake.

He closed Rebecca's door behind him and then we moved into my bedroom. I closed the door. I noticed also that my bedroom window was already shut, making there no need to close it. My bedroom was on the side of the house where the streetlights could shine in from the window. They were shining in, but much fainter due to the sheer volume of falling snow outside. Or at least, it was what I assumed was snow.

""What's going on with Rebecca?"" I whispered, ""Did she just try and–"" I struggled to find the right words yet again, ""--take her own life?""

""Mhm,"" Jake mumbled.

Then, after an uncomfortable silence, he whispered, ""It's not the first time she's done this.""

""What?"" I said, alarmed.

""I know, I know,"" said Jake, ""Usually she just does it because she wants attention. She has mood swings. The other times she's done this all she needs is some food and drinks she likes and some company.""

""Are you nuts?"" I said, struggling to stop myself from yelling, ""She had a noose around her neck, man.""

""I know,"" said Jake, ""I didn't know what to do. The university already knows about it. She's been going to counseling sessions.""

""Mate,"" I said, ""Don't you think this was something you might have wanted to mention to me? My room is right next to hers.""

""I know,"" said Jake, again, ""But I didn't want to make things worse for her. She promised me not to tell anyone else about it.""

My head started to spin. I sat on my bed, which was unmade and littered with the clothes I had tried on and decided weren't the kind of fashion I wanted to wear for the party.

""So she just tried to take her life?"" I said.

""I don't think she was really trying,"" Jake whispered, ""I know it sounds bad but it's more of an attention thing.""

""You said that,"" I said.

""The big explosion outside shocked her,"" said Jake.

""Shocked her?"" I said.

""No, not shock-shocked,"" said Jake, ""She was getting herself ready and then the explosion startled her and then she actually started to – you know. All the other times she just sort of sits there with the noose around her neck. She texts me what she's doing and then I come and help her.""

""Jake,"" I groaned.

""It's fine, it's fine,"" said Jake, ""It's all fine. Just leave it to me and Philip. Please don't tell anyone, okay? Please.""

There was a pause. Not because I was deliberating what to do, but because I simply felt overwhelmed with everything that was already happening. The big golden explosion, or whatever it was, was bad enough. Though Rebecca and I were certainly not close and in fact didn't like each other all that much, the idea that she had just attempted suicide, and in fact had toyed with attempting suicide several times before was simply beyond the pale.

""Okay,"" I said, finally, ""Does she need anything? There's a first aid kit under the kitchen sink.""

""No, she's fine. She just has a sore neck,"" said Jake.

Jake opened my bedroom door.

""I need to get back to her,"" he said, ""Thanks for understanding.""

""Wait,"" I said.

Jake stopped.

""Yeah?"" he said.

""Was this what you were trying to tell me about?"" I said.

Jake shook his head from side to side and whispered, ""No.""

""You want to tell me now?"" I said.

""Later,"" he said, ""It's not important right now.""

Jake then made his way back into Rebecca's room and closed the door behind him.

I let out a ragged sigh.

Since we were having our first my MIL is very “I want my son to have a son” and when we said we weren’t finding out the gender she called the baby “he” or “brother” for good luck according to her. Don’t worry my husband would tell her he loves his daughters and would be blessed to have another. But that’s not what this is about lol. It started with Halloween plans. We were pretty certain our baby would be born near Halloween due to a need for induction for medical reasons. My in laws have in some capacity invited or initiated an invite to our house for Halloween every year since we’ve lived in a neighborhood. But I was due to deliver a baby so my solution was to have both sets of grandparents here for our toddler and school aged daughters. Plus manage trick or treaters and our dog, pure chaos so the more the merrier right? Well my MIL texted earlier in the week and asked if we’re “still on” for them to come over Halloween night and help my husband with the girls. I responded well the plan is to have both sets of grandparents over since my mother was staying with the kids already and birth is unpredictable, if my husband can make it to trick or treat with the big kids that’s great but the baby and my health and supporting a safe delivery is priority over a (very fun) but silly holiday. She proceeded to call us and start by saying “well I didn’t know your parents would be there, isn’t that overkill, we can handle the kids”. First of all Halloween isn’t “yours” traditions and plans change. But okay that’s not the plan, I know the kids would be handled but the point is everyone is willing to help and the kids will have a full day of school parties/activities under their belt and a mother in the hospital that’s a lot for one set of grandparents in retirement age. Also my in-laws spew this bullshit all the time about wanting to spend more time with my parents. Anyway I had the baby early on Halloween, my in laws proceeded to not show up to the school parade even though MIL asked me and my mother all the details (she called my mom and told her she thinks it’ll be too busy and too much) then they’re late for trick or treating knowing my parents cooked everyone dinner, note they don’t have jobs/dogs. My mother in law doesn’t make a plate and is cold and weird to my parents my mom said it was uncomfortable to interact with them a little. They do proceed to drink wine out of their to go coffee mugs and crack into the red I bought myself for postpartum. Saving maybe 3 oz to go bad on my counter. Thanks? Anyway they have been over twice (in the two days I’ve been home). My MIL loudly insisting they can’t stay, they won’t bother us, baby looks happy with me being weird about not wanting to hold her. Asking my older kids if they want to go home and sleep at her house (my oldest also had a panic attack when she found out about us staying overnight at the hospital insisting she didn’t want to stay overnight at MILs house, the reason we had my mom watch them). Anyway here’s the kicker. The second time she brought over food ONLY for my husband because the meal she made she knew I didn’t like. She made a point to say “I only brought enough for *husband* since I know you don’t like this meal”. So nothing for the POSTPARTUM of TWO DAYS mother or anything for her three kids. She hasn’t brought the baby anything or myself so far. That’s totally fine but wtf is that with the food?! When they left I said to my husband I thought that was incredibly rude. He was kinda understanding of the rational but agreed she should have asked if there was anything I would want or just not chose to make that meal. Am I overreacting? I just think it’s so rude! She is always really weird towards us postpartum but I’m sorry that’s just SO rude!!! Thanks for listening lol!",14,1762181805.0,motherinlawsfromhell,8,0.94,False

1ondqxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessBuildingUSA/comments/1ondqxz/contractors_feed_local_economies/,Contractors Feed Local Economies,"# Do not Underestimate the Power of Local Business

The real power in the United States economy is small business. In fact, contractors feed local economies each day and most of them are [small businesses](https://bbbookworks.com/biz-fix-it/). Many underestimate the power of local business. They fail to see how our [communities](https://www.publicsquare.com/) would collapse if we do not sustain a healthy small business community. 

Take a moment to think about it. Or better yet, grab a coffee and sit by a main road in any community. Write down what type of vehicles you see during the hours of 6am and 12 noon. You will find that many of the vehicles are work vehicles. Many are [contractors ](https://advancedbusinessbuilder.com/)and technicians. They stop at local stores, gas stations, supply centers, and more. They work closely with your neighbors. They accomplish tasks and order parts that are shipped. This feeds [trucking and logistics](https://advancedbusinessbuilder.com/keeping-business-books-current/).

 

# Types of Contractors

Just a few: roofing contractors, flooring, siding, kitchen cabinets, fencing, railings, chimney sweepers, pressure washing, landscaping, painters, HVAC, pool, irrigation, plumbing, bathroom, property rehabilitation specialists, carpentry, and many others. 

The men and women that work within these trades pump money into the local economy, and also help the nation (and global) economy. In fact, places such as Lowes benefit from the efforts of the “small shops”. People in the real estate industry also benefit from the efforts of contractors through property value increases after repair. They also satisfy town government to accomplish permit submissions and occupancy permits. 

Yes, contractors are true workhorses of the local economy. 

 

# Areas Where Contractors Feed the Economic 

Small shop contractors pump [valuable dollars](https://bbbookworks.com/) into the local economy each day. Most even live in the local economy and pay taxes like the rest of us. Some of the areas that they impact are as follows:

1. Transportation (travel, fuel, tolls, supplies, delivery, etc.)
2. Food Service (meals)
3. Tools (project-specific tools)
4. Local Supply Shops (purchasing parts, supplies)
5. Real Estate (maintenance, home improvement)
6. Waste Management (recycling, waste removal, salvage)
7. Resident (savings options through competition)
8. Government (increasing property value = tax revenue; tax on supplies)

These are only a few of the ways that local contractors help the local economy. 

# National Impact of Contractors

* U.S. gross domestic product (GDP)—the value of all goods and services produced in the country—totaled $23.0 trillion in 2021; construction contributed $959 billion (4.2%).

1ondqvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1ondqvk/irritable_rant/,Irritable rant,"I will probably delete this as I know I’m not being fair or rational but sometimes it feels like my wife will never ever understand how easy it is for me to wake up and then not be able to get back to sleep at all.

After a collected 3 hours of sleep across the past 3 nights (as in, approx.1 hour each night), I finally started to doze off on the sofa this afternoon and I thought you know what, I’m going to just let it happen instead of trying to stay awake until tonight. I don’t ever go up to bed to nap because I can’t do it, the only time I have ever been able to nap is if I’m watching tv or reading and then just slowly started to drift off. So that happened whilst I was reading and I told my wife I was gonna just put my head down for a bit. 

But that didn’t last because first she walked around the living room looking for something and her footsteps woke me up, then she placed her coffee mug down loudly on the table, then she put the tv on and whilst it was quieter than it usually would be, anything that isn’t total silence will immediately wake me up and when she’s napping I make a point of always putting headphones in and being as silent as possible (even though she’s a heavy sleeper so it doesn’t wake her). When I woke up after an hour of sleep at 6 o’clock this morning it was because she was popping pills out of the foil packet whilst sat in bed next to me and it instantly woke me.. if I need to take pills in the night I’ll make a point of tiptoeing out the room to do it quietly in the bathroom. 

Sometimes I wish she knew how miserable it feels to be a chronic insomniac and a ridiculously light sleeper, and wish she could just be a bit more mindful when I am finally asleep. 😩 ",1,1762181424.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

I am a long time fan, but just now post for the first time. Please excuse me, as English is not my first language! Also this post will probably be long, so.... sorry for that as well!
I am not sure where to start, as I am still processing the thing I am about to share. So my husband and I are best man and made of honour to this couple - Mandy (26f) and Pete (30m). We know each other through our husbands workplace, as they are colleagues. Mandy and Pete got married during covid in 2020, and just celebrated the fourth birthday of their daughter (Patty).
Last week I received a message from Mandy, asking me, if we were coming to Patty's b-day, as we didn't confirm. At first I didn't think much of it as my husband was PTO that week, even though Pete and my husband (let's call him Dave) see eachother every day and chat whenever they are not at work. 
The day before the birthday Pete called Dave, to drink coffee and chat. When Dave got home afterwards he seemed pretty weird and asked me to sit down.
As it seems Pete called Dave, because he wanted to let him know before the event, that Mandy and him are no longer together. Not only that, but he had another child (2.5 y.o) from another woman, who is now living with him.
Saying I was shocked is understatement, but I tried to keep it cool the next day at the party. Well....until I saw Mandy that is 😀 I couldn't keep my comment to myself and said ""I found out you just lost 80kg, and I have to say- you look great!"" 
Thankfully she took the joke, and started sharing.
Before I continue I need to add that after Patty was born, we kind of lost contact with eachother. We had a small child, they had a small child, she returned to work very early (where I'm from we have 2 year maternity leave and she returned before Patty was one) and was busy. I told Dave many times to set something with Pere, and every time Mandy was unavailable. So at some point I stopped trying and we just congratulated eachother for holidays and birthdays.
Back to Mandy's story:
As it seems when Patty was born, this colleague of Pete and Dave, DM-ed him to congratulate him, and started hitting on him. They hooked up, and she got pregnant when Patty was 4 months old. Mandy and Pete separated and he went to the other woman, leaving his wife and newborn struggling to pay rent (that's why she returned so early to work). 
There were many more horrible situations, and I won't share all but some are:
1. He came back to Mandy, when the other woman kicked him out.
2. He never paid for anything Patty related.
3. Mandy went through a very serious surgery, and because she was unable to have sexy time, he went back to the other woman.
4. He made Mandy keep all to herself, because he didn't want anyone knowing (he was supposedly ashamed), and told all their mutual friends, Mandy is always working and don't want to keep in touch.
And many more nasty stuff like that that even have evidence for happening.
So, here comes my role in all this. Mandy obviously decided she had enough and want to tell everyone, what peace of shit Pete is. She asked me if Dave or I would share this whole drama at their workplace. Dave, said he is on her side, and is 100% at the opinion she is right, BUT doesn't want to mess with Pete's work and make it seem as if he is gossiping. I on the other hand know a couple of their colleagues, and am very tempted to tell them again my husband's will.
So dearest potatoes, would I be the A-Hole if I expose a cheater at his workplace?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1ondp86,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyGoodContent/comments/1ondp86/the_rise_of_recyclable_standup_pouches_a/,The Rise of Recyclable Stand-Up Pouches: A Sustainable Solution for Modern Packaging,"In the modern era of packaging, sustainability has become more than just a trend—it’s a responsibility. With growing awareness about environmental conservation and the need to reduce plastic waste, businesses and consumers alike are seeking eco-friendly alternatives to traditional packaging materials. Among these innovations, **recyclable stand-up pouches** have emerged as one of the most effective and versatile solutions. They combine functionality, durability, and sustainability, providing brands with a reliable way to protect their products while minimizing environmental impact. This article explores the benefits, features, and growing importance of recyclable stand-up pouches in the packaging industry.

# 1. The Evolution of Flexible Packaging and the Rise of Sustainability

Over the past decade, the packaging industry has undergone a significant transformation. Traditional packaging, often made from multi-layered, non-recyclable plastics, posed major environmental challenges. These materials were difficult to recycle and frequently ended up in landfills or oceans. In response, manufacturers began to invest in **flexible packaging** solutions that could deliver both performance and eco-friendliness. This led to the development of recyclable materials such as mono-material polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), which can be reprocessed more efficiently. **For more:** [**recyclable stand up pouches**](https://es.bowepack.com/collections/recyclable-pouches)

https://preview.redd.it/34nrmhxr12zf1.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&s=428c42b2a1bdee6746c5ba25c248c74e104b36db

**Recyclable stand-up pouches** are an evolution of this sustainable movement. Unlike conventional laminated pouches that use multiple plastic layers or aluminum, recyclable pouches are made using single-source materials that can enter existing recycling streams. They maintain all the benefits of flexible packaging—lightweight structure, durability, and excellent product protection—while offering a responsible end-of-life option. This combination of performance and environmental responsibility has made them increasingly popular among brands in food, beverage, pet care, and personal care sectors.

# 2. Key Features and Benefits of Recyclable Stand-Up Pouches

Recyclable stand-up pouches are designed to provide **maximum convenience and protection** for both businesses and consumers. Their main advantage lies in their structure: a flexible yet strong design that allows the pouch to stand upright on shelves, enhancing product visibility and presentation. The use of recyclable materials, typically PE or PP, ensures the packaging can be collected and processed in recycling systems without contaminating other materials.

Another key benefit is **reduced material usage**. Compared to rigid containers such as glass jars or metal tins, stand-up pouches use up to 75% less plastic by weight. This translates into lower transportation costs and a smaller carbon footprint, as more units can be shipped in the same space. The lightweight design also minimizes waste volume, contributing to a more circular economy.

Additionally, modern recyclable pouches can include **advanced barrier technologies** that preserve freshness, flavor, and quality. Whether for snacks, coffee, detergents, or nutritional supplements, these pouches can protect against moisture, oxygen, and light exposure. Features such as resealable zippers, spouts, and tear notches further enhance consumer convenience. Together, these factors make recyclable stand-up pouches both functional and environmentally friendly—an ideal choice for brands aiming to align with global sustainability goals.

# 3. Environmental Impact and Circular Economy Benefits

One of the greatest advantages of recyclable stand-up pouches is their positive impact on the environment. By using recyclable materials, they help **reduce plastic pollution** and promote resource recovery. Traditional multi-layer packaging, while effective, is nearly impossible to recycle because different materials must be separated before processing. Recyclable pouches solve this issue by using a **single material type**, making recycling easier and more cost-effective.

Moreover, the production of recyclable pouches requires significantly less energy compared to rigid packaging. The lower material weight reduces greenhouse gas emissions during manufacturing and transportation. When collected and processed correctly, these pouches can be converted into new plastic products, supporting a **circular economy** where materials are reused instead of discarded.

Many companies are now partnering with recycling programs and initiatives such as **Store Drop-Off** systems in the United States or **plastic return schemes** in Europe to encourage consumers to recycle their pouches properly. These programs ensure that recyclable stand-up pouches contribute to a closed-loop system—minimizing waste, conserving resources, and protecting the planet for future generations.

# 4. Industry Adoption and Consumer Demand

The shift toward recyclable stand-up pouches is being driven by both **industry innovation** and **consumer expectations**. Shoppers are increasingly aware of how their choices affect the environment and prefer brands that demonstrate sustainability commitments. Surveys show that eco-conscious consumers are more likely to purchase products with recyclable or compostable packaging, even at a slightly higher price.

In response, global brands and small businesses alike are transitioning to recyclable pouches for a variety of products—ranging from organic foods and pet treats to cosmetics and detergents. Major retailers are even setting packaging sustainability targets, requiring suppliers to use recyclable materials by specific deadlines. This widespread adoption is not only helping brands meet environmental regulations but also enhancing their reputation and customer loyalty.

Technological advancements have also made recyclable pouches more **versatile and customizable**. High-quality printing options allow vibrant designs and branding, ensuring that eco-friendly packaging doesn’t compromise aesthetics. Manufacturers are investing in research to develop even better recyclable films with improved strength, barrier properties, and heat resistance, further expanding their applications.

# 5. The Future of Recyclable Stand-Up Pouches

As global sustainability standards continue to tighten, recyclable stand-up pouches are poised to become the **future of flexible packaging**. Governments and organizations worldwide are implementing stricter packaging waste regulations, pushing manufacturers toward materials that are both recyclable and reusable. This growing momentum will drive further innovation in materials science, leading to new generations of recyclable, biodegradable, and even compostable pouches.

However, for the full potential of recyclable pouches to be realized, there must also be greater investment in **recycling infrastructure**. Effective collection and sorting systems are crucial to ensure that recyclable packaging actually gets processed and reintroduced into the production cycle. Public awareness campaigns, corporate responsibility programs, and government policies all play essential roles in building a truly sustainable packaging ecosystem.

In conclusion, recyclable stand-up pouches represent a significant step toward reducing global plastic waste and promoting circular economy practices. They offer an ideal balance between practicality, performance, and environmental responsibility. As more companies embrace this technology, consumers can look forward to a greener future—one where packaging not only protects products but also protects the planet.",1,1762181317.0,OnlyGoodContent,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My partner and I recently took the big leap: after 5 years working warehouse shifts, we quit the day job to launch our own brand, Spark Speak. We’re based in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and our mission is simple: help you raise your voice and spark a conversation.

Here’s what we’re doing:

Fully customizable products — from stainless steel keychains (rectangle / circle / heart) with your photo, to hoodie sets (super thick 100% polyester, cozy AF) in 10 colours and 5 sizes.

We’ve got tumblers (double-wall stainless steel 20 oz), frosted gradient 20 oz glass cans (5 colours) AND t-shirts in 10 colours + 5 sizes.

We’re building a coffee line next (with playful packaging + the same motto: Raise your voice, spark a conversation).

We’re big on personalization, uniqueness, and letting YOU speak through your gear (not just us).


Why we’re posting here: Reddit feels like the real deal — a place where people don’t just buy things, they believe in ideas. We’d love your thoughts:

What kinds of custom items would you like to see that you can’t easily find elsewhere?

What materials / features matter most to you (e.g., durability, eco-friendly, local production, fast turnaround)?

If you could design a “raise your voice” piece, what would it say or show?


We’re not here to spam links — just to start a conversation, get feedback, and figure out how to serve you better. If you’re local to Kenosha or nearby in Wisconsin / Illinois, we also plan to drop some local community collabs / events.

Thanks for reading. Happy to answer questions (pricing, timelines, design options) if you’re curious — or just overall thoughts. Let’s raise voices together.

Cheers,

Accept USDC on ETH? Solana folks bounce.

Add SOL? Bye Polygon.



Push Chain's Universal Payments make that possible. ⚙️

Accept ANY token from ANY chain in 1 line.



Just shipped. Devs, build once, pay everywhere. 👇

https://preview.redd.it/7gy1eeh202zf1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e6b8bc0ac2073b3036cc0f6f7081f55fe00249d

Push Chain handles payments like a boss.



3 levels to Unlock:



1️⃣ Accept one token (e.g. USDT) from every chain

2️⃣ Accept multiple tokens (e.g. USDT, USDC, DAI)

3️⃣ Or build a contract that accepts any token from \*\*any\*\* \*\*chain\*\* 🤯



Here’s how 👇

  
1️⃣ **Level 1** → **Accept one token from every chain**



Straightforward — just call sendTransaction() and pass the token you want to accept.

ETH, Solana, Base, BNB — all work.



[https://push.org/docs/chain/build/send-universal-transaction/#send-transaction-with-funds](https://push.org/docs/chain/build/send-universal-transaction/#send-transaction-with-funds)

2️⃣ **Level 2** → **Accept multiple tokens from any chain**

Just:

* Detect all tokens a user holds when they connect
* Replace **funds.token** with their selected token

https://preview.redd.it/c26q9c1j02zf1.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8ca1f87f5207fbaaf51318d6ea1be28254f11d1

3️⃣ **Level 3** → **ANY token/native (Chad Mode 🤖)**

This is the most fun to do, as it opens up payment from any token and requires users to only hold native token on the chain they are on.

To do this:

* Extend your contract to accept msg.value
* Pass in the value you want
* **Chad Mode:** Use an AMM to quote native → USD so you accept exactly $1 worth

How does this work?

* Since Push Chain abstracts Fees from any chain, the native token of that chain is calculated in relation to native token of Push Chain
* And the user pays the native token
* Under the hood, you get the native token and can choose to convert it to the stablecoin of your choice3️⃣ **Level 3** → **ANY token/native (Chad Mode 🤖)**

These are pretty powerful on their own, but pair them with #x402 (Coinbase's protocol for AI agent payments) → seamless agentic economy.

Users: “Pay $1 for services from any chain” → Handled automagically.

Agent: ""Pay $3 for coffee"" → Handles token/chain automagically.

An economy that is suited both for Users and Agents → That is universal payments on Push Chain.

I had already been dreading this day. 
Today I arrived to work FULL of emotion 
I have had my 9MO child in daycare 3 x a week, for the last two weeks to ease her into care. It hasn’t been an easy transition with food refusal etc and shorter days of 3-4 hours to accustom her.  I didn’t want her first day back to be my first day back.
I head to work this morning 
I arrive at my workplace 
I work for a very large, well known company. I will not disclose what industry,  but please know that it is MASSIVE. 
Decent Mat leave policy etc 
I arrive this morning to….NOTHING 
No laptop, no system access, no profile, no CLUE 
Nothing has been ordered, scheduled, prepared for my start date 
I have had a very average experience in the lead up to my return. My direct lead was unsure of the 10 “Keeping Up days” in fact, didn’t even know what they were when I brought them to attention 
My industry is compliance heavy, and to mitigate my 12 month gap, would have utilised these days to catch up prior to starting 
I have been in contact with my direct lead since mid August regarding any changes, etc to my return to work 
I have had to make sure that I was the one reaching out, despite there being a very clear process to follow for mothers returning to the workplace-there was minimal contact in regards to my start date that was NOT initiated by myself 
Fast forward to today. I arrive. Ready with bags for me to EBF, take my breaks, head back to a job I had previously enjoyed
To be met with ZERO organisation. No laptop.  no system access. Zero tools to do my job, aside from some knowledge on my part of the role, and a lot of shit talking and defusing with customers on my part. 
There has been, somehow despite all my efforts, of which I have recorded, not a single thing prepared for my return. 
There wasn’t even a manager to say hello to when I arrived, I was left with a team member who was unsure of what to do, and no access to leadership to ensure a smooth opening. Manager arrived late, and told me they had forgot I was even starting today. 
I had to awkwardly explain I need time to express, to a stranger, my new manager. 

I saw out the day and safe to say, I resigned, effective immediately. 
3 years with this company, to not even have a single thing organised for my return 
I emailed my direct manager who apologised, however said due to staffing levels TODAY and “unforeseen” circumstances can understand why it was exacerbated for me, and they would love the opportunity to have a coffee and work through my concerns 

My return to work was not “unforeseen”
I have been in constant communication since July
I have communicated multiple times the date I started back at work 
I communicated multiple times that I am EBF and my needs around this 

I am a competent and capable employee, aside from some training and updating, after a year off, I am able to step into my role, with no impact to service or job for the most part.
Every single person could have called in sick today,  and with access and codes, I would have still been able to do my job. This should not have affected the preparation to have my things organised in the lead up to today 

It is merely an excuse while this company does damage control to cover itself and try to keep me onboard whilst they struggle through systemic staff turnover 

I do feel bad for my colleagues who are clearly stressed, due to the workload, and I did consider seeing out my required 3 week notice period, but it is not my job to manage disorganisation. 

I have resigned professionally, and will be offering my timeline of events, or lack thereof to HR. 
I do not care to catch up for a coffee, and discuss my career. This is not an afterthought. 
I will not be returning to my role 
It is not worth my time and effort to be away from my child, for a company that doesn’t even, seemingly know my name. 

I am no stranger to the corporate world. I am big enough and ugly enough to hold my own
This got me wondering,
What actual support is there for mothers returning from Maternity leave 
This multi million dollar company has a Return to work framework, literally spelt out for them, but has failed so dismally
What has everyone else’s experiences been good or bad-and what do we need to bridge this gap of women wanting to work and contribute?

I’d like to send a care package to a friend in Norway that’ll contain some books, a stuffed animal, and coffee. I plan to use First Class International Package service and box the goods up myself since that seems to be the most cost-friendly for things under 4 lbs. The total value is less than $100, which from what I can see, I think I can mark the package as a gift and not have to worry about them paying a fee to obtain the package? Are there other surprise fees my friend could end up needing to pay? If possible, I’d like to cover any of those costs.

I also have some questions on shipping labels and customs forms. If I bring the box to the USPS, are they usually able to help me generate and attach a shipping label as well as fill out the customs form? I had read that these are usually the same thing now, with a barcode on the shipping label that gets scanned for customs. I wanted to make sure this is how it works, or if there are more things I should prepare ahead of time. I really appreciate any help!!

I understand why they’re asking: tourism is a key source of revenue, and reviews are king. But the flip side of this is that every single place has 4.8-5.0 stars, making reviews nearly useless—so visitors are less likely to trust those reviews, since they know they’re not entirely genuine.

i tell myself i’m fixing the lamp, but really i’m trying to weld memory into obedience. the light flares nuclear for a second, a false sun on my skin. survival is a reflex, not a choice. a myth of rarity to keep her small. to want is rewarded, to have is a sin... to keep? sacrilege. i learned to breathe without noise. silence: devotion’s leash. my tongue beheld his language by bleeding. my jaw served chaos faithfully. loyal to the turmoil - it only made him brighter, an othello outline of a man i almost remember and never really knew.

little sunshines: hands like open flowers. my lullabies are splints, trying to keep them raised. i can’t be small anymore. they need to learn kind strength, not the kind that cuts and crushes. i wade through keys and magnets and sing it all away.
""sleep, little suns, through storm and smoke,
the sky is cracked, but the stars speak hope,
i built you a home from what didn’t break -
in my hands: bellyaches, heartbreaks, keepsakes,
brittle offerings i mistake for faith,
when i disappear, i’m not far from you,
i’m learning the shape of something new,
dream of gardens that never burned,

coffee grounds down the sink. the drain struggles, then swallows him whole for a second. pressed french, chest pressed. everything comes back. like bile like prayer. eating from my mouth, regurgitate the ache. contradictions cradle me, i submit my soul to the soft rot of denial. as if this is fate, not design - and we’re a chris and cathy and we’re just doomed and beautiful. forced to communicate unsigned and unsent, rewriting terror into tenderness - distance intimacy, your cruelty is a verse i polish. forbidden lovers? self-inflicted. 

dream of glass: molten, breath-made, red and fevered - a body that only held shape while burning. when it cooled, it remembered every breath that made it. i lean left when i walk now. glass everywhere — not broken, just tired of being clear. sharp edge, sharp name, sharp mouth. bernard something. i keep thinking if i melt it down i could make lungs that breathe superglue instead of air. that’s what this feels like. we were shimmer waiting to crack. i see you reflected in pearls of wet paint. the yellow duck swings and repeats its refrain. our song. you go through the drawers again. diamonds burrow in the dust and wait, saving their shine.

i’m finding pieces of myself stuck to the undersides of mugs, still shaking. cigarettes gone out, still bleeding heat to breathe. conjoined magpies stitched inwards, duct tape peeling under their skin. his eyes could melt me. his eyes could drown me. crying is recycled: apologies and shame are made.
""this isn’t forever, i whisper, i swear,
don’t call it leaving, call it circling synced,
don’t call it loss, call it air between us,
don’t call it punishment - it’s faith, i think.""

i’m trying to fix something that’s dissolving. maybe i should stop expecting it to hold. i can’t find where you end and i begin. we’re still half-wired together, and i’m still trying to learn how to pull the plug without the plastic blistering.

1ondg2m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ondg2m,Silvia V4 Shower Screen / Jet Removal,"Hi all,

So I picked up a V4 from auction for a bargain.

It was filthy, so I gave her a nice clean, descale, cafiza and the like.

One of the cleaning tasks was the shower screen.
Unscrewed, removes from group head and then sit in cafiza.

The problem is, there was what appeared to be a rubber gasket on the brass shower head block, and the screen doesn't detach from the brass block.
My research indicates it should, but it almost looks moulded on, so I don't want to break it completely.

Can you assist

1) is there meant to be a gasket or was it just super old coffee grounds

2) is the shower screen meant to detach, if so, how can I remove it without damaging.


Going to try turn the pressure down a bit too, but that's another issue completely.

I’ve survived heartbreak before. It stung, I cried, I healed. Life kept moving.  
This time, a piece of me simply stopped existing. Not metaphorically. The part that used to light up at the idea of tomorrow, the part that believed in second drafts of love. It’s gone. The silence where it used to live is deafening.

Three years on, I haven’t touched another person. Haven’t swiped, haven’t flirted, haven’t even let my eyes linger on a stranger in a coffee shop. The mere thought of small talk with someone new feels like being asked to run a marathon on broken legs. Exhausting doesn’t cover it.

Am I over her? No.  
Do I want to be? Desperately.  
Why can’t I? That’s the question that keeps me up at 3 a.m., staring at the ceiling like it owes me answers.

So I’ve made peace with the quiet. I’ll probably stay alone. Not because I’m broken beyond repair, but because no one else will ever fit the shape she carved out of me. I’m not being dramatic; I’m being honest. If it can’t be her, I’d rather have the truth of missing her than the lie of settling for less.

It is what it is.  
It was what it was.  
I still don’t know what it was that made it hurt this much.  
But I know I’ll carry the scar for the rest of my life, and I’ve stopped pretending that’s a tragedy. It’s just the price of having loved her completely.",2,1762180625.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Santa Clara vs. Gil Vicente: A Primeira Liga Showdown Where Gil Vicente Aims to Avoid ""Clara"" Mistakes**

The Primeira Liga’s Gil Vicente vs. Santa Clara clash on November 3, 2025, promises to be a tactical tango—or perhaps a clumsy waltz, depending on who’s tripping over their own ambitions. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and nonsense to predict who’ll walk away with the trophy (and maybe some dignity).

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For

The betting market treats Gil Vicente as the clear favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **2.15-2.20** (implying a **46-48% implied probability** of victory). Santa Clara, the underdog, sits at **3.5-3.9** (**26-28%**), while the draw is priced at **2.85-3.1** (**33-34%**). Translating this into plain English: bookmakers expect Gil Vicente to win, but they’re also bracing for a tight contest where Santa Clara’s “surprise attack” (more on that later) could disrupt the script.

The spread bets back this up: Gil Vicente is favored by **0.25 goals**, meaning they’re expected to eke out a narrow win. Meanwhile, the total goals line is split—some books offer **Over 1.5 goals at 1.53** (65% implied) and **Under 1.5 at 2.30** (31%), while others list **Over/Under 2.0** at near-even money. In short: expect a low-scoring grind unless someone invents a coffee maker that also scores penalties (more on that below).

---

### Team News: Drama, Discipline, and a 5-0 Hangover

**Gil Vicente**: They’re the Primeira Liga’s version of a well-oiled espresso machine—consistent, reliable, and capable of brewing a 4-win streak in their last five matches. Fourth in the table with 19 points, they’ve got the form of a team that’s figured out how to tie their shoelaces before kickoff (no tripping over ambition here). No major injury updates, which is about as exciting as a spreadsheet, but in football, consistency is often the quietest path to glory.

**Santa Clara**: Vasco Matos, their head coach, has sounded like a frustrated math teacher grading a student who *almost* did their homework. “Improve behaviors! Greater aggression! Focus!” he’s pleaded, referencing a 5-0 drubbing by Sporting Braga as a “moment that must impact training but not defin

Bloodwork all normal. Fecal calprotectin (sp?) test came back at a dead even 50. 

I am the burpiest person I know, but usually in the morning it starts out as what I can only call involuntary frog croaks. My day immediately starts with a bowel movement. Usually some nausea will hit about 15 minutes later, then another bowel movement. Then I battle nausea and stomach discomfort (not sharp pain) for a good hour or two. Every morning.

I basically don’t want to eat anything in the morning or throughout the day as a result, depending how long the discomfort lasts. That said, once I’m feeling “normal”, I can eat or drink anything. I put “normal” in quotation marks because I burp throughout the day, food or not.

So far I’ve tried loperamide (sp?) and pantoprazol (sp?). Loperamide did nothing, maaaaaybe the pantoproazol helped?

Not sure I’ve noticed any certain trigger foods. Sometimes I’ll have a meal at McDonalds followed by a chocolate bar, yet in the morning, I don’t even want plain oats. Completely cut out my morning coffee.

Toffee Bits

Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
In a pot, add in butter, brown sugar and salt. Mix as the butter melts and everything comes together. Once it is fully incorporated and bubbling to around 300F, pour it onto the prepared baking tray. Smooth it out as thin as you can get it. And set it aside for it to cool.

Once the toffee is cool and hard. Take your hands and break it up into shards. You can also use a rolling pin, blender or pallet. I like to keep them a decent size so they add some texture throughout.
Blondies

Preheat the oven to 350F. Prepare an 8”x8” pan with parchment paper.
In a glass bowl, add in the butter. Place it into the microwave for 30 seconds at a time until it is fully melted.
115 Grams Butter
Whisk in the brown sugar, vanilla, instant coffee and salt.
3 Grams Instant Coffee, 1 Gram Salt, 200 Grams Brown Sugar, 3 Grams Vanilla
Next add in the egg and the egg yolk.
1 Egg, 1 Egg Yolk
Add in the flour, and mix until just combined.
150 Grams Bob’s Red Mill 1-1 Gluten Free Flour
Add in the chopped up chocolate into chunks and the toffee bits. Mix until just combined.
110 Grams Chocolate (chips will work, but shards from cutting a bar is best), 1 Batch Homemade Toffee Bits
Pour everything into the prepared baking tray. Bake for 20 minutes. You will test it just like brownies. Put a tooth pick into the middle. If it comes out clean with a tiny bit of dough, it is done. That way it says brownie like texture.
Let it sit into the baking dish to cool. Once cool, remove it from the baking tray, and cut into squares. Enjoy!",7,1762180496.0,glutenfreerecipes,1,0.9,False

I’m taking the plunge and making the move to your beautiful city in a couple of months, and I’d love your insider expertise on where to live.

Here’s my deal: I’m a 33-year-old guy with a remote job, moving from Latin America. I’ve visited Warsaw before and absolutely fell in love with its vibe—the resilience, the history, the culture that feels both proud and warm. We had a great time, Warsaw and I, but we never quite fell in love. I’m coming back to change that.

I’ll be honest, my main mission is to build a real life there: immerse myself in Polish culture and, most importantly, make new friends. My Polish is currently at a ""dziękuję"" and ""piwo"" level, but I'm a fast learner and promise to be charmingly clumsy with the language.

A few key details:

· The Fear: I’m genetically programmed for sunshine. The cold... terrifies me. I’m prepared to trade my flip-flops for real shoes, but a neighborhood with some cozy cafes and a warm community vibe will be my survival blanket.

· The +1: I’m moving with my 3-year-old Frenchie, a snorting, napping, professional good boy. Hoping this will be my ultimate friend-making cheat code. Dog park recommendations are as valuable as apartment tips!

· The Hobbies: I love biking everywhere, long city walks, dancing (anything from salsa to just finding a good beat), and traveling. Easy access to the main attractions is a huge plus so I can play tourist until I feel like a local.

So, wise people of Reddit, where should I look?

I’ve been eyeing areas like Powiśle for its vibe and proximity to the river paths, or Mokotów for its supposedly greener, community feel. But I know you’ll have the real scoop.

Where would you live to easily meet people, have a solid pub/coffee shop scene, and be a short bike ride from the action?

With friends spread across the US, UK, and Canada, and a random obsession with EU soccer, I needed an [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) that could keep up. I tried quite a few, and here’s how my top five shook out.

# 1. [IPTVMEEZZY](https://iptvmeezzy.life/)

* **Price:** $16/month (cheaper if you pay yearly)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (US, UK, CA, EU, and way more)
* **Smoothness:** 9.5/10 (HD streaming even during peak hours, rarely any buffering)
* **Firestick:** Worked instantly with my **iptv firestick**
* **My Take:** I actually stumbled onto IPTVMEEZZY thanks to a **free trial** from a US-based **iptv reseller**. What really impressed me was how steady the streams stayed—even when I was jumping from US basketball to live British news and then over to EU sports channels. I barely had to think about it, which is about as close to **perfect iptv** as I’ve seen.

# 2. VisionStream Pro

* **Price:** $15.50/month
* **Channels:** 34,000+ live, 120,000+ VOD (US/UK focused, good CA/EU options)
* **Smoothness:** 8.2/10 (HD is solid, but big US sports nights can cause a little lag)
* **Firestick:** Easy setup on my **iptv firestick**
* **My Take:** VisionStream has a great EPG and tons of US and UK content, which was perfect for following news cycles and binge-watching British dramas. The **free trial** let me test out channel stability, and while it handled most things well, there was some buffering during the Super Bowl. Overall, a pretty reliable pick for daily streaming.

# 3. EuroPlay IPTV

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 29,000+ live, 95,000+ VOD (strong EU/UK lineup, covers US/CA basics)
* **Smoothness:** 7.8/10 (HD for most things, but EU football finals can push it to its limits)
* **Firestick:** Runs well on **iptv firestick**
* **My Take:** I’m a sucker for European variety, and EuroPlay definitely delivers—French news, German documentaries, UK comedies, and the usual US/CA suspects. The HD is crisp, but when there’s a big match in the EU, don’t be surprised if things slow down a bit. Still, it’s a great fit if you lean toward international content.

# 4. MapleConnect TV

* **Price:** $13.20/month
* **Channels:** 22,000+ live, 70,000+ VOD (Canada/US heavy, UK/EU standards included)
* **Smoothness:** 7.2/10 (good for most shows and news, but not always top tier for big live events)
* **Firestick:** Simple setup—my **iptv firestick** handled it easily
* **My Take:** MapleConnect is my go-to for background TV. Canadian morning news, US talk shows, and the odd UK soap opera are all here. Their **free trial** was hassle-free, and for everyday HD viewing, it’s more than enough. Just don’t expect perfection during the NHL playoffs!

# 5. CityLine IPTV

* **Price:** $12/month
* **Channels:** 17,500+ live, 52,000+ VOD (covers US/UK/CA/EU basics, not many niche or specialty channels)
* **Smoothness:** 6.8/10 (reliable for standard HD viewing, but big events can be hit-or-miss)
* **Firestick:** No issues with the **iptv firestick**
* **My Take:** CityLine IPTV is the kind of service you grab if you just want the main networks in HD and don’t need a ton of obscure channels. It’s affordable, and for regular news or sitcoms it’s fine, but if you want **top rated iptv** for major live events, you might notice some limits.

# IPTV Takeaways: What I’ve Learned This Year

* **Always start with a free trial.** That’s the only way to know if the provider fits your habits and devices.
* Even the [**top rated iptv**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/) services can lag when the whole US or EU tunes in for a big game.
* No matter how many channels I have, I still rotate between the same dozen or so.
* Using an **iptv firestick** makes life so much easier—switching between providers is basically painless.
* If you want to be an **iptv reseller**, be ready for lots of “why isn’t my stream working?” texts from friends and family!

So, while I’m still searching for the truly **perfect iptv** (maybe it doesn’t exist?), I’m happy that there are so many solid choices out there. If you find a service that handles your favorite channels and doesn’t buckle during live events, you’re onto a winner.

Spent an hour trying to work out why I couldn’t ship tools to a town. Went through everything I could think of. Checked the wagons on the train could take tools, checked the trucks could take tools. Yes cargo train station, yes cargo truck station. Rebuilt truck stop after checking it was a truck stop and not a bus stop. Made more coffee. Rebuilt sending train station. Got trains mutually blocked. Rebuilt approach to new train station.

Completely ready to tear my hair out. Eventually went to add cargo building to receiving truck stop before I rebuilt it again and realised I had somehow lost connection to the road and so truck stop from the cargo station. No idea how that happened as station snapped to road when I built it. Maybe truck station is at different level?

Anyway, configure, bulldoze building and replace and the link is back. Tools straight away getting placed on sending train cargo platform.

**Day 1 – Monday**

**Morning**

I wake up just before my 5.20am alarm. I am definitely under the weather. I get the kids off to school, then I head back into bed for another hour. SO gets home from his night shift, and goes to sleep in a different room so I do not disturb him when I get ready for work. I do my morning routine (brush teeth, shower, skin care, brows, get dressed). I also place my coffee in my coffee mug, ice is my Meoky tumbler, and breakfast and lunch in my lunch bag and head off to the office. I get to the office by 7.45am, park in my spot and head up to my office. I clock in and start doing my reports. It’s the end of the month, so many reports are due. I have a quick breakfast of watermelon, sausage and a one egg omelette. I also finally lose my voice and accept that it is time to visit my GP.

I get an invoice for shipping and customs duty for an item I purchased and pay US$20 for it (client package so it’s included in their pricing). I also pay a biker US$5 to go collect it and place it on the courier for me (client package so it’s included in their pricing), then I realise I had a brain fart, and the item I was expecting hasn’t been cleared through customs yet. I cancel on the biker, and ask him to hold onto the payment until I need the pickup.

**Afternoon**

I get my diagnosis of tonsillitis and otitis media. Fabulous. I get an antibiotic shot, and also buy my meds. And since I am at the pharmacy, I also pick up some items I had run out of (body scrub, hair gel, multivitamins, and cough syrup for the kids). Only one medication was covered by medical aid, I had to pay cash for the rest. Everything comes to **US$41.00**. I get back to work, and have my lunch (prawn and pasta stir-fry situation) and start drinking my water. I add my water to the ice in my tumbler, so it is nice and cold in this very hot weather (my town has temps of 38\`C this week). I put my head down as I continue to work on my reports and send the completed ones to my boss for review. I also browse reddit for a bit, and do this MD. Finally, it’s time for a daily all hands meeting, and I am in it till after the end of the workday.

 

**Evening**

I drive home and try to sing even though my voice is on holiday. SO switched shifts today, so he will be off work later in the night, which means I am the parent in charge this week. Due to the nature of his shifts, and the kids’ schedules, SO will only get to see them on Saturday. I remember that I didn’t take out burger patties to thaw this morning, so I have to pivot on the boys’ lunch for school tomorrow. French toast it is then. 8 year old will also get a sandwich since he finishes school later than 6 year old. I also meal prep my food for work (double cream plain yoghurt, boiled eggs, leftover prawn and pasta stir-fry). I place burger patties and buns in the fridge to thaw overnight for tomorrow’s lunches for the kids. I give both 6 and 8 their cough syrup and shoo them to bed by 7pm. We live far from the nearest schools so the kids have to go to bed early so they can get enough sleep before the next school day. I eat a tiny portion of fried rice and have my meds, then I shower, do my evening skincare and change into my nightie. I do my Zulu Duolingo lesson and I am asleep by 9pm.

 

**Total spent – US$41.00**

 

**Day 2 – Tuesday**

**Morning**

My alarm goes off at 5.20am and wake up feeling groggy. The weather seems to have changed overnight and it’s quite cool. I get the boys’ lunches out, pack my lunch bag, fill my travel coffee mug with coffee and my tumbler with ice. The boys have their porridge, and I realise 8 needs a new backpack. The kids go off to school, and I doom scroll in bed for a bit before getting up to brush teeth, shower, do my skincare (AM is wash with kojic acid soap, tone with Gentle Magic lotion, spray Briotech hypochlorous acid spray, moisturize with Palmers Fade Cream and sunscreen), do my brows and get dressed. I leave SO snoring peacefully, and drive to the office.

I clock in, power up my laptop and open my reports for today. I also update this MD, then start working with TikTok playing in the background. I have my brekkie of boiled eggs and yoghurt with chia seeds, and wash down my meds with black coffee, but I feel nauseous AF. I take a quick break to walk around the office and sell some moisturizing masks that I had bought. I manage to sell 8 and get **US$4**. That’s a win for me. I also pay my monthly canteen sub - **US$5**. I go back to my desk and attend two meetings and do more work, and chase people to submit their reports.

 

**Afternoon**

I am hit by a wave of exhaustion and a headache. Since its lunchtime, I decide that a nap in the corner of our office would be a good move. I have 2 paracetamol tablets, spread my office blanket on the floor, and try to take a power nap at lunch. I had planned to pop out to the supermarket at lunch, but my drawers are still stocked with snacks, and I do need to lose a few kilos. I end up doom scrolling on TikTok until I feel hungry, then I warm up my pasta and prawn thing. I also top up my tumbler with water and have lunch. I get a call asking me to chair a meeting, but I have never attended that type of meeting, and would not be able to chair. I decide to continue updating my report this afternoon, as a case I wanted to do has incomplete information. I faff around most of the afternoon, I’m feeling down and tired tbh. I jump into the daily meeting and its intense today. The great grandboss is not happy at all. Definitely going to clock out late tonight.

 

**Evening**

I finally clock out 6pm and head straight home. I check to see how 8 did his homework, and kid really needs to improve his handwriting. I make the boys’ lunches for tomorrow, burgers, and 8 gets an extra lunch of ramen with sausage. I make myself a scrambled egg and cheese stuffed garlic roll for brekkie.  6 asks for some milk, and after correcting his grammar and politeness, I pour out some for him. Its bedtime for the kids and off they go. I finally have dinner (rice, beans and a chicken wing) and my meds. 8 gave me a textbook of his that needs to be covered with plastic covering so I do that. I then shower and do my PM skincare (wash with kojic acid soap, tone with Gentle Magic lotion, spray Briotech hypochlorous acid spray, moisturize with palmers fade cream) and get into bed. I do a bit of Zulu and French on Duolingo, scroll a bit and pass out soon. I wake up briefly when SO gets home but pass out again.

**Total spent – US$5**

**Day 3 – Wednesday**

**Morning**

My alarm goes off at 5.20am and I groggily try to switch it off first from my smartwatch, then succeed on the actual phone. I get up and head to the kitchen where I boil water for my coffee. I pack the boys’ lunchboxes into their bags, and load up my lunch bag with my sandwich and coffee. I put a load of laundry on as well. I help 6 make his cereal and 8 opts for a banana this morning. The kids head off to school, and I go back to bed to get a cuddle in from SO. I finally get up, brush teeth, shower, do my AM skincare, brows and get dressed. I hang up my laundry to dry on the drying lines outside. I leave the house by 7.30 and arrive at the office at 7.40am. I have a training to attend out of the office today, so I quickly run up and inhale my brekkie before driving to the venue for the training. I realise we got the wrong start time from work, and we are actually late. The training was starting at 8am and we were told 8.30am. We go through the modules for the day, and by the end of it, I was tired out by the heat.

 

**Afternoon**

I drive back to the office, and head straight for our canteen. I had placed my lunch order late this morning, and was just hoping that the chef had received in time. I am absolutely famished at this point, and I really need some food stat. I was lucky, and I get to demolish a plate of rice, beef liver and coleslaw for **US$1**. I go back to my office to start working on today’s reports, and also update my MD. I finish my reports and start faffing around online. I’m tired, and it’s hot. My ears also start aching, I think I may have to go back to see my GP. I jump into the daily meeting and I am tired of this workday already. I want to go home and sleep.

 

**Evening**

The meeting is finally over and I clock out and head home. Once I get home, I make the boys’ lunch for tomorrow. Today I made a hot dog wrapped in bread dipped in French toast batter and pan fried. 8 approved of it so much, he ate half his lunch before bed time. I also eat my dinner of fried rice, and medicate before putting the kids to bed at 7pm. Once the kids are in bed, I do a spot of ironing the laundry I had washed in the morning while watching the Great Kiwi Bake Off. After that while finishing the episode, I also sewed 4 of 8’s torn books for school, and take down the high bun I had been wearing since Sunday night, detangle and restyle in a low bun. When the episode has ended, I head to our room to put away the laundry, before showering, PM skincare and doing my Zulu Duolingo lesson. Bedtime was at 9pm. I wake up briefly when SO gets home, and then sleep again.

**Total spent – US$1**

 

**Day 4 – Thursday**

**Morning**

I wake up with my adrenaline on high and my heart thudding. Ugh, I hate nightmares. At least SO cuddles me in his sleep, and I feel better. It’s 4am, and I am awake until my 5.20am alarm goes off. I get up, get the boys off to school and then head back to bed again. I fall asleep and suddenly wake up at 7am. Oops, I overslept. I am going straight to my last day of training out of the office and the site is further from my house than my office. I quickly brush teeth, shower, do AM skincare, brows and get dressed. I put ice in my Meoky tumbler, and quickly have a bowl of cereal before heading out. I arrive at the venue a little before 8am and heave a sigh of relief.

Training starts and today, we are moving at a brisk pace since we have to finish today and do the assessment. We have a quick break, and a colleague of mine who is a mutual friend of mine and SO’s buys me a RedBull and Doritos. I have been flagging since I did not have any coffee this morning and I gratefully accept. We all chat for a bit before going back into class to finish the modules and do the assessment. I manage to get everything correct, and I am pretty chuffed.

**Afternoon**

Since the training is now over, I head back to work and give my friend a lift back to the office. Since its lunchtime, I drop off my bag in the office and go to buy groceries as well as lunch. I get into Pick n Pay and I buy yoghurt, muesli, roasted macadamia nuts, sausages, chia seeds, hotdog rolls, crisps, face soap, lotion and chocolate. The chocolate, macadamias, and crisps are for my desk, while everything else is going home. For lunch, I buy rice, pork stew and pickled beets. Everything came to a total of **US$53.00** paid using my local currency debit card. Once I am in the office, I realise the lady serving lunch in the supermarket did not give me cutlery. I end up begging colleagues for something (My kingdom for a spoon) and manage to find a plastic spoon. I finally manage to eat lunch, and do some errands for my grand boss. Then it is time to settle in to do more reports. My client’s package finally arrives and I pay the biker US$2 (paid for by client) to pick it up and forward it to me. The daily meeting starts and there are a LOT of mosquitoes in my office. We just got some insecticide so I spray under my desk, and hope the mosquitos leave me alone. This is my least favourite part of summer, the insects.

 

**Evening**

The meeting is finally over and it’s time to go home. I clock out, and drive home. I offload all my groceries and put them away, while listening to 6 tell me a lot of random stuff. That kid is talkative AF. I do their lunches for Friday, tomorrow they get a hotdog, can of fizzy drink and a mini pack of Haribo. I know 8 will love the Haribo. My meals are a yoghurt parfait and watermelon for breakfast, and rice and chicken stir-fry for lunch. I skip dinner since I am still full from my late lunch and just do my meds.

 8 is feeling lazy and doesn’t want to do his homework, but I send him off, they have end of year exams in a few weeks and he needs to buckle down. He is a very intelligent kid, but he doesn’t like working hard (I am sadly the parent he inherited that trait from). 6 makes me play a game with him, apparently we are escaping from prison through sewers. He loves describing how slimy and stinky he is. Bedtime arrives, and it’s off to bed with the kids.

I shower, do my PM skincare and dive into my bed. I also pick out my pink outfit for the Pinktober commemorations tomorrow. I do both Zulu and French on Duolingo. Then I doom scroll on TikTok, Twitter (it will always be Twitter to me) and Reddit. I decide that I really don’t want chicken for lunch, and make some eggs to with my rice, and pack that up instead. Finally at 9am, I wind down with my book. I am re-reading The Red Queen by Philippa Gregory. Lights out for me is at 9.30pm.

**Total Spent – US$53**

**Day 5 - Friday**

**Morning**

I wake up at 1am and fail to get back to sleep for an hour, so I doom scroll on Reddit, and then read some more of The Red Queen until I feel drowsy. I am woken up by my alarm at 5.20am. I am groggy and it’s cool and cloudy, but I have to get going. I get the boys off to school and pack up my food, coffee and ice for the day. As I go to place everything in the car the lid of my coffee tumbler explodes, and sprays hot coffee on my nightie and face. At least I do not get scalded. I put my coffee in a different coffee travel mug, and place everything in the car. Then it’s back to bed for a cuddle from a sleepy SO.

I wake up again at 7am. I brush my teeth, shower, do my AM skincare, brows and get dressed. SO wakes up and we talk about our days today. He has to go to the kids’ school for consultation day, and I ask him to let me know what the teachers say about the boys. I head off to work, leaving home pretty late at 7.40am.

I arrive at the office, park and clock in. I get stuck in on my first reports for the day. I also message my mum who is getting some tests done in South Africa. She tells me she’s at the doctor, and will get back to me soon. I am obviously worried, but I have to get on with work. I get called into a meeting, and while in the meeting my cousin calls. She tells me the doctors found another growth in my mum, and a biopsy needs to be done. I update my older sister and brother with the news. I am the baby of the family, but I am considered to be the more level headed one now surprisingly.  I get back to work. I also have my breakfast and morning meds at some point during the meeting.

After my meeting ends, I go to deposit money US$100 into my mobile money account. I send **US$44** of this to my sister in law as mine and my mum’s contribution to our savings co-operative we have. I also keep US$50 in a separate mobile money wallet for my Starlink, Netflix and Spotify subs. I attend the Pinktober commemoration and it was pretty interesting, though some of the information was a little… dodgy. I go back to the office to finalise my reports and send them to my boss before lunch time.

 

**Afternoon**

My cousin’s husband calls me, and we discuss the logistics of getting the money to pay for my mum’s medicals to South Africa. I promise to send the money ASAP. I have my lunch and scroll on TikTok for a bit to distress. I also tell SO what was found in mum’s PET scan and he’s pretty sympathetic. Anyway, I follow up on information I need to do another report, and I finalise it and forward it to my boss. I snack on some Haribo and sweet potato crisps to distress. I also finally get the information I had requested on Tuesday, but I also realise I need something else from those guys, so I email them back to request it from them. I update my MD, and join the daily meeting. I also do my last report for the day while listening in the meeting. I end up realizing that my worry is leading me to make stupid mistakes, so I quit the reports, and just listen in the meeting.

 

**Evening**

The meeting ends, and I leave the office like a bat out of hell. I drive home, and when I arrive, I strip my bed and put all the bedding in the hamper so I can do laundry tomorrow morning. I make my bed with fresh bedding. 6 tells me that his tooth fell out, so I know the tooth fairy has to be out tonight. The kids are playing after their dinner, and since I am not that hungry tonight, I have passionfruit sorbet for dinner (H Town Gelato is awesome). I have my meds and go to take a shower and do my PM skincare. Today is a bit different since I decide to do a moisturizing face mask as well. After I’m done, I go watch Peppa Pig and Mr. Bean with the boys. 8 asks or popcorn, so I make some for him. They are banned from eating in the sitting room, so he has to go eat in the dining room. Bedtime is later tonight, and they are off to bed at 8.30pm. After tucking them in, I head to bed to do my Zulu and French on Duolingo, and then doom scroll. Once the boys have been in bed for an hour, I transform into the tooth fairy, and retrieve the tooth, and leave **US$1** under 6’s pillow. I also see that the kids had set a trap for the tooth fairy by putting a croc on their bedroom door handle. I giggle, and go off to bed.

SO wakes me up sometime after 10pm. I had asked him to wake me up when he got home so I could be the tooth fairy, but I’m grumpy about it. He talks to me about his meetings with the kids’ teachers and we chat while he showers. He asks me to also put **US$1** (from his wallet) under 8’s pillow since the tooth fairy hadn’t visited when his tooth fell out. She probably had visa issues. We hang out until 1am then I really have to sleep because I have work in the morning.

**Total spent – US$ 45**

 

**Day 6 – Saturday**

**Morning**

Ugh, I am so exhausted. I finally wake up at 7.30am and drag myself to the shower. I brush my teeth, do my AM skincare and slather myself in sunscreen as temperatures will be high today and I have errands to run in town as well as go to work. I put on a load of laundry, and pack my breakfast to take to the office. Today is another yoghurt parfait (Greek yoghurt, muesli, chia seeds and turmeric honey) and diced watermelon, macadamia nuts for a snack and ice for my tumbler. I leave home and give a lift to two of our neighbours into town. I also refill my tank with US$47 of petrol (this was deducted from my salary) on my way to work. I clock in and decide to relax today. I surf the internet, text my mum and update my MD. I also have my brekkie and the last of my meds. Finally. I go to pick up my client’s package and pay US$5 courier fee (included in pricing I give my client). I also hang out and chat to friends/colleagues in their offices until knocking off time.

 

**Afternoon**

I have another package I need to send to another town at no cost to me, so I wait until the lady going to that town is ready. I hand over the package and head home. The boys are playing with their dad, and it seems they went shopping and got haircuts. I am starving, so I have some scrambled eggs and fries. I take over parenting as SO heads off to work. 8 has some homework to do, so I supervise him, while cleaning my room, doing another load of laundry and entertaining 6. I also do my wash day in the middle of all this. Once 8 is done and hanging out with 6, I take a brief nap on the couch. Then I wake up and get everything together to start ironing my laundry. It is still boiling hot, but it must be done.

 

**Evening**

I am finally done with all my ironing and have put away all my laundry. The kids are playing, and I decide to crack open a can of Bernini Mimosa and relax watching Netflix. I also have a shower, do my PM skincare and put on my nightie. I then do my Duolingo. The boys go off to bed at 8.30pm, I follow soon and hit the hay at 9pm.

 

**Day 7 – Sunday**

**Morning**

I wake up at 7.30am, well-rested for once. I get up and go and get started on brekkie for the family. The boys have their cereal as I decide on what to make. 8 helps me with making the waffle batter, while 6 talks at us non-stop. SO wakes up and takes the kids into the garden for their “manly” chores i.e. picking up dog poo in the yard, feeding the chickens and rabbits and cleaning up the yard. These are chores are done daily, even though I did not talk about them earlier. Mainly because I do not do them. Breakfast is fried eggs, waffles, canned peaches, and a syrup made from reducing the syrup the peaches were canned in. Very simple but enjoyable. I also cook some sadza which will be part of the dogs’ dinner later on in the day. I clean up the kitchen after we are all done with breakfast while SO hangs out with the kids.

 

**Afternoon**

The entire family has their showers, and I do a very abbreviated version of my AM skincare routine. SO goes off to work. I put on a load of laundry, and the kids and I load up a bunch of bags in my car to take to my mum’s place. My mum is being transferred from the town we live in, so my cousin and my mum’s companion are packing up her house.  We pass through KFC and buy dinner for 7 (**US$44**). Our order gets a bit delayed, and the kids get given a complimentary krusher. We get to my mum’s house and drop off some KFC and the bags, then head back home as it looks like a huge storm is coming through. On our way home, we pass through the pharmacy and I pick up cough medicine for 6 and nail glue (**US$10**).

When we get home, we realise the layers escaped from their enclosure, so we catch them and put them back in. Then I feed the chickens and rabbits while the kids pick up our onion harvest so we can move it into the house before it rains. It’s a lot of work, but we manage to do it. I also warm up the dogs’ stew of chicken heads, feet and chicken innards so I can mix it in with the sadza for their dinner. The kids eat their KFC as I finish the animal chores. I do the dishes, and hang up that load of laundry we had left on. I take another shower because I’m grimy from the onion picking and pet feeding and change into my PJs. I glue on my nails and my fingers look better instantly.

I do the kids’ lunches, as well as get their thermos flasks of tea ready so that I just pour in boiling water in the morning. I also pack up my meals for tomorrow (egg salad roll, my uneaten dinner)

 

**Evening**

The kids play and watch TV. I give 6 his cough syrup, rub his chest and back with some eucalyptus oil, and put them both in bed by 7pm. I go to hang out in my room, pick out my outfit for the morning and do my Duolingo. I go to bed pretty early because I am tired.

**Reflections** – This was quite an expensive week for me. I promise, I do not drop this much money regularly, it’s just that it was the end of the month, and I had to pay all these bills. Time to tighten up my spending, because the holidays and my kids’ birthdays are coming up and that’s my biggest expense generally.",49,1762179941.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,4,1.0,False

I am looking for any online shop that stocks this particular Tri Dung coffee, Red version, 500gr.  
The only place I can find atm is Dragon Coffee, but unfortunately they do not ship anywhere outside of UK.

Any clues? Has anyone tried this coffee before?

This coffee is 60% Robusta, 20% Arabica, 10% Chari and 10% Moka, a variety of Arabica with characteristic 'chocolate' tones.

​I'm dealing with a very frustrating issue on my Breville Bambino Plus.
​Here is the problem:
​The machine powers on normally, and all the lights are stable.
​When I try to start any process (pulling a shot or using the steam wand), it begins without issues.
​Almost immediately (one or two seconds later), it deactivates, stops the process, and returns to the initial power-on mode (the lights stay solid as if it were ready, but it's not doing anything). This happens even if the machine has just been turned on.
​Things I have already tried (with temporary results):
​I have tried descaling it using the  descaling fluid.
​After a lot of effort (running several descaling water cycles and then rinsing), the machine starts working normally.
​However, after only preparing 2 to 4 coffees, it reverts to the same immediate shutdown problem.
​Has anyone else experienced this? Any ideas what could be causing it to ""deactivate"" or shut down mid-process?
​Thanks in advance for any suggestions or advice!",1,1762179728.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

1ond0up,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1ond0up/my_bedtime_keeps_moving_forward_no_matter_what_i/,My bedtime keeps moving forward no matter what I do,"I have tried every method I've seen on the internet for fixing sleep schedules - eat/shower/freshen up several hours before you want to go to bed, wake up at the same time every day no matter when you went to bed, gradually move back your bedtime by some amoutnt of time every night, pull an all nighter so I'm extra tired and go to bed at the time I want to become the norm, etc etc etc. None of it works. I might get ine or two good days in a week where I'm making progress, and it just goes down the drain. I have gone to bed at 4AM, consistently, for years now. I hate it more than anything, because whenever I've had jobs, I've had to wake up for work at 8AM. So you'd think I'd be so tired that I go to bed way earlier, right? Wrong, I just get those 4 hours every night. I can go home early, I can jntentionally not go out or do things I want to do, I have thrown my life in the garbage, all in the hope that I'd go to bed at a time where I can wake up and not have the entire day gone, but nope, I ALWAYS end up back where I started. I have started going to bed now at 6AM. Yes, that late. Sometimes even later (went to bed at 8AM about a week ago). And whether I wake up at 8AM, 10AM, whenever, I never end up going to bed early.

Which means, I'm in a constant state of being underslept. I am never okay, my brain sucks, I can't think (and my brain has stopped growing due to my age, so I'm screwed), I can't do anything, and my workouts are ineffectual because I'm not getting sleep. It sucks. I want to fix it but I don't know how, and I can't imagine my ADHD or any caffeine I take is doing anything good (not a huge caffeine drinker, but I tend to have a cup of coffee every now and then, never more than once in a day though)",1,1762179699.0,sleep,0,1.0,False
