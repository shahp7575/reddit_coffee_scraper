1jun3zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinasterideSyndrome/comments/1jun3zf/quitting_finasteride_seeking_friendly_advice/,Quitting Finasteride - seeking friendly advice,"Dear all,

25M, working in IT, not very sporty, but very active, for sure ADHD.

Sadly, I appeared not to be the Hair Cafe, and trying out Finasteride for about 9 months resulted in some extra problems that I consider bigger than the hairloss.

Since I started fighting for my hair in December 2023, I made a huge recovery by trying out Stemoxydine+RU58 first and then switching to Fin with Spectral DS, of course, with supplements, micro-needling, Alfatradiol and Keto shampoo. Yes, it looks great, but I am not happy about it at all now. RU, BTW, gives me tiredness, pain in the chest, and a racing heart, so, let's not talk about of it.

Before starting Fin I had a skyrocketed libido, was able to go for 3-4 rounds, and I could get so horny even with thinking. I was always talking about sex and had good inventory from the sex shop... It was not a problem to do it every day. Saw Palmetto was not affecting my libido even on 1 gramm daily dosage.

The problem is that in about 5th month of Finasteride, I started to notice the side effects. I was taking 1mg EOD, and at some point I had persistent pain at the right ball, one day it was so bad that I couldn't go hard with my girlfriend at all. I did a small pause of 2 weeks and then started to take 0.5mg EOD.  
My urologist threw a box of Cialis to me and told me to cease Finasteride, but hair...

Things became better after I dropped the dosage, the pain was gone, I was able to collect the libido to have sex with my girlfriend. But, it's still pretty unstable and feels like a lottery.  
I lost the morning wood, I lost the wood when I was going to sleep, I can't get hard by thinking, it takes a while to get hard on the porn, and when I defocus it goes soft very fast again. The thing itself feels half-dead and numb. It was never the case before...

I dropped the dosage again to 0.25 ED, got hair shed, and lost lots of gains on the crown, but things didn't get much better. I am so sad about this because my girlfriend is an amazing person, I love her so much. She says she doesn't care about the hair and she is fine with me being bald, it's better for her if I stop doing all these hair recovery experiments. Even my mum said I don't even joke about the sex anymore.

Also! The whole brain felt like in fog, memory in peaks was one huge hole, all the thoughts about suicide and I was crying a lot which is abnormal for me. Also, I gained Àú15KG eating the same stuff as usual, I cook myself and avoid sweets, I am a tea lover, I don't do coffee, and even I think I got the breast to be bigger a bit than it used to be....

The only thing that had a potential effect was MACA and when I was taking Doxazosin I also got it from my urologist.

Last week I was on a business trip and I skipped taking finasteride for 2 days. I was back home and I decided not to touch this thing for already like 1 week. I don't feel anything positive for now, probably too early.

From what I see from reddit, it takes about 3-6 months in lucky cases to get better from what people say. The problem is, I am very afraid of PFS and what if I have already developed it... I miss this wish to have sex with everything that moves I used to have before...

I will really appreciate bits of advice and opinions of people who are also in the same situation. Can I ask you for any kind words, friendly advice on how to recover, and e.t.c. about its decommission?  
¬†I am fine with continuing the rest of the stack, but I wish to exclude anything DHT blocking for now. I don't have any issues with the Spectral DS.  
  
I am also considering doing blood tests, what should I include besides testosterone, estradiol, prolactin, globulin, T3, T4, Kortizol, Glucose, Vitamine D, cooper, Zink, Ferritin, Magnesium, cholesterol? DHT is not covered by the insurance in Vienna and it's done by AKH but they may not have the reactives, it happened before. The rest is fine, I will talk to the doctor.

Also, since I have 6 packs of 1mg remaining, should I consider trying out the topical one? I have no idea what to do with the boxes.

1jun0nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Non_Medical_ADHD/comments/1jun0nw/memory_management_techniques_for_communicating/,memory management - techniques for communicating with my future self,"i've been wanting to write this post for some time but keep forgetting, haha.

seriously, though, i have a few metaphors for how i envision the process of storing and recalling information.

one such metaphor is that of a project manager, where the project team consists of me, myself and I communicating with each other through time.

another is that of a conductor, especially vis a vis exercising the 'art' of selecting, among all the tools and techniques available to me, the most practical/efficacious for the need at hand.

the last one i'll mention in this post is that of a 'chief of staff', especially vis a vis *controlling access to* my future self or, strictly speaking, my future self's consciousness.

this last metaphor isn't unlike how evolutionary psychology believes 'mental subsystems' *present* thoughts to our consciousness, a la 'thoughts thinking themselves'. 

all three of the metaphors above and techniques below can be thought of as 'presenting information to our future selves or future consciousness, but i digress...

**alarms** \- as they are the 'nuclear option' of information delivery, i use alarms only as a last resort. the only repeating alarm i have is to remind me to brush my teeth, for which no other method seems to work. other than that, i use 'PRN' (as needed) alarms for things like 'check laundry' because neither my washer not my dryer has an end-of-cycle buzzer.

*fun fact: you can transform any alarm into a 'digital sticky' by simply calling out 'hey, siri', which will silence the alarm but keep it displayed on your phone. this is super handy when, for example, you don't need to act on something immediately and you don't want to snooze it; but would rather just be reminded of it the next time you see or pick up your phone.*

**monthly planner** \- anything and everything for the future goes into my monthly planner. each morning, while my coffee is brewing, i write anything in my monthly planner for today onto my whiteboard.

**whiteboard** \- only actionable things are displayed on my whiteboard. everything else is in my monthly planner (future).

**cues** \- one of these days i'm going to have to inventory the many ways i use cues. it's a skill like anything else with endless applications. 

just yesterday, right before i started to record some audio on my computer, i had to pee. knowing there was a good chance i'd forget about making the recording when i made it back to the computer (1) because the idea of making the recording was spontaneous and (2) because who knows when/if i'd even go right back to the computer or get distracted with something else.

...so i (completely automatically without thinking at all) just placed my headset/microphone on top of my keyboard which would remind me whenever i returned to my desk.

**breadcrumbs** \- anything that helps you remember where you left off with anything can be considered a 'breadcrumb'. in the above example, the headphones are both a 'cue' and a 'breadcrumb'. 

breadcrumbs can be digital, too, e.g. simply leaving an application open on your PC to remind you that that was the last thing you were working on. 

they can also be elaborate, e.g. in the form of an outline where you can keep track of the origins of all the rabbit holes you go down while programming or include text (like a todo list or point you want to remember to make) below your current cursor location so you will 'run into it'.

**shopping list** \- generally, i add items to my shopping list (whiteboard on side of my fridge) anytime i open a container of something and i have only enough additional containers to last me two shopping trips (more if an item is not reliably stocked in the grocery. bananas and chicken never need to be on the list because they are the most perishable of my staples and therefore are the drivers of my grocery trips.

last, but not least, my favorite is **eliminating the need to remember** via routine, simplification/elimination of unnecessary things, brain re-wiring / habit formation, systems design for self-regulation (e.g. search this sub for 'UHT milk'), fixed 'charge-to-discharge ratio' schedule with two-hour productivity periods divided by mealtimes, etc.",1,1744142438.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

I'm in therapy and starting to work with eating out at caf√©s and such. Today I visited my favorite caf√©. They have great coffee, and I was like; I'm gonna treat myself to a pastry. They were out so I had some chia pudding with passion fruit mousse, almond flakes and roasted coconut flakes. I enjoyed it and even more so; I enjoyed feeling normal! Drank my coffee, ate my food, looked out the window and read a little. It was amazing, the sun was shining and the spring is finally here.

But here I'm sitting, hours later and getting anxious about it. You all know what thoughts go through my head, so I'm not going to write them out here (not a safety behavior, but I'm a bit lazy atm). It doesn't help that we (my partner and I) ate kale in a soup tonight. He got sick (outside our home) 15-16 days ago after eating something with kale, and that triggers me as well.

How do you deal with these thoughts? I don't want to ""run away"" and asking for reassuance or anything like that, but I'm still new to my therapist, and we haven't really gotten to how to deal with these kinds of exposures. It's late evening where I live, so I'll have to go to bed soon, but I can't imagine anything worse right now than to lie down in the dark and be alone with my thoughts...

How do you all deal with these situations? The exposure was nice, I enjoyed it and was proud of myself, but now it all feels ruined because of the anxiety that I feel right now.

EDIT: I'm not at all in a full blown panic attack, but just have this uneasy feeling of stress and anxiety in my body, not being able to relax and a lot of diffuse thoughts of getting sick from the food.

I have chosen to stop smoking cannabis, no more coffee, already bought AHCC and supplements ( just honestly to have ""control"" over *something* as I wait for the colpo results. I am so scared.) I am a bit too late on the preventative, of course, but these choices have helped my anxiety.

I messaged my gyno this weekend very (apologetically) anxious, and she was so rude and dismissive.  Telling me that even if the changes are severe at my age (27) we should just wait it out. I do not want to wait. I want a LEEP, or just something to be proactive.  I am just so sad. I am mourning for women, how we have to fight to be seen.. Am I being dramatic? Most experiences I am reading here have found the results with just being proactive. I am not being optimistic just trying to be realistic. I understand every body is different....

\*\*\*\*HISTORY\*\*\*\*  My mother has had multipleLEEP, insistent HPV for 20+, had me after the most invasive LEEP, considering the history i feel our bodies are not designed to fight the infection.  She has never had cancer, but is not in the best health at 65.",1,1744142152.0,PreCervicalCancer,0,1.0,False

I was wondering if anyone else has a Kalita Wave and  what kind of recipes on general you like to try with light/medium-light roasts. 

I was brewing for two so I doubled the recipe:

40g fresh ground coffee in the basket

100g water in and bloom for 45 seconds

500g water slowly and let it drain down

Whole thing was done in about 3 minutes

I've used the Wave twice now with this bean and it seems to make a really solid cup of coffee. It isn't like the Switch that brings out the origin flavors and sweetness. It produces what the wife and I call ""Old fashioned Starbucks"" coffee. Like when they actually focused on making a good cup in the 90's. I'm really enjoying the different flavors from different brewers. ",1,1744142029.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been dealing with a strange digestive issue since April 2023 and I‚Äôm still trying to figure it out. Hoping someone here might relate or have suggestions.

Here‚Äôs the timeline:

* In April 2023, I suddenly started vomiting daily with intense nausea and had no appetite. This lasted for about a month.
* After that, the vomiting gradually became less frequent ‚Äî from every few days, to once every couple of weeks, to once every few months.
* My last episode before today was in November 2024. Then I vomited again today (April 2025).
* The vomiting is always just once, not repetitive. It usually happens after I eat something like chocolate, pasta, or processed food.
* I feel very full and nauseated after eating heavy foods or junk.
* Despite all of this, I have maintained my weight, and I have regular bowel movements, but it really caps my bulking potential because I feel so full with an certain amount of food.
* I work out 3x a week and still have energy, though my appetite is poor.

What I‚Äôve done so far:

* Endoscopy: normal
* Blood tests: all normal
* No history of trauma, or nothing, in these 2 years I vomitted probably twice than in my whole life

My concerns:

* Could this be gastroparesis even if I only vomit once per episode, and it‚Äôs months apart, or is this more like GERD?
* I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cyclic vomiting syndrome either since I never vomit multiple times ‚Äî just once and then I feel better.

Any thoughts, experiences, or advice are super appreciated. I‚Äôm trying to clean up my diet for a month to see if it helps, so no coffee, pizza, whatever.

I really love this space but because I‚Äôll be moving closer to friends/family, I‚Äôm looking for someone to take over my lease in this huge rent-stabilized, pet friendly studio apartment in Bed-Stuy! The start of the lease takeover is May 1 and ends on August 31 2025 with the option to renew.



Rent: $2850

Security Deposit: $2850

Lease Takeover : May 1- Aug 31 2025 (with option to renew)

About the Apartment:



It‚Äôs on the top floor of a four-story elevator apartment that has its own semi-private outdoor roof-deck. It is about 800\~ sq ft, and it comes with a split-unit central AC/Heat with built in Bluetooth speakers. In the kitchen there is a microwave, full size dishwasher, full size fridge, ceiling vent, and lots of counter space and cabinets for storage. The bathroom has a deep full size tub with a shower and has plenty of under sink storage space. There is a spacious closet next to the bathroom and the bedroom/alcove area which could hold a standing wardrobe with more than enough space for a full/queen king size bed.



The living space has enough space for a full size couch, coffee table, tv console and even a couple of desks if you work from home.



For internet,there is access to VerizonFios and the utilities that need to be paid are for gas/electric which is about $100 per month depending on your usage.



The building is great for pets as my neighbors all have either a dog or a cat and everyone gets along well! There‚Äôs a lot of natural light as it is north facing, so you get a lot of nice light in the morning without it getting too hot during the day.



It‚Äôs a 15 min walk to the J Myrtle stop and the G Bedford-Nostrand Stop, while close to the B38, B43 buses. It is also a 10 min walk away from the Herbert Von King Park that has a dog run as well as coffee shops and restaurants nearby.

\- A roof top deck (in addition to your own)



\- On-site laundry facility



\- Secure bicycle storage



\- Top-notch fitness center



\- Stunning rooftop with panoramic views

I can honestly say I‚Äôve never read a book like this before.  Simon Jimenez wrote such a powerful, unique story that contrasts a lot of the fantasy books we all spend time with.  The juxtaposition between the audience members and the introductory protagonist, and the two main characters taking up the majority of the story really made this book special. It introduced an almost magical element into the story that felt like reading folklore when you were a kid. The way Simon incorporated the inner monologue of characters who normally wouldn‚Äôt have the opportunity to have their story or thoughts voiced throughout the book really made this book shine. It added much appreciated perspective and gravitas to the story. I‚Äôve never read a book that has done this quite like this book does. The prose shines through here. It‚Äôs beautiful and poetic but also direct and utilitarian. It makes you sit back and smile or dab at your eyes as you read at your local coffee shop ( or so I‚Äôm told cough cough). There were just so many layers to this story that worked for me and I found it touching. Highly recommend this book to anybody looking for something that goes a bit against the grain. Truly a fantastic piece of literature and Simon Jiminez has a new fan in me. ",14,1744141680.0,Fantasy,1,1.0,False

1jumorl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hairloss/comments/1jumorl/quitting_finasteride_seeking_friendly_advice/,Quitting Finasteride - seeking friendly advice,"Dear all, 

25M, working in IT, not very sporty, but very active, for sure ADHD. 

Sadly, I appeared not to be the  Hair Cafe, and trying out Finasteride for about 9 months resulted in some extra problems that I consider bigger than the hairloss. 

Since I started fighting for my hair in December 2023, I made a huge recovery by trying out Stemoxydine+RU58 first and then switching to Fin with Spectral DS, of course, with supplements, micro-needling, Alfatradiol and Keto shampoo. Yes, it looks great, but I am not happy about it at all now. RU, BTW, gives me tiredness, pain in the chest, and a racing heart, so, let's not talk about of it. 

Before starting Fin I had a skyrocketed libido, was able to go for 3-4 rounds, and I could get so horny even with thinking. I was always talking about sex and had good inventory from the sex shop... It was not a problem to do it every day. Saw Palmetto was not affecting my libido even on 1 gramm daily dosage.

The problem is that in about 5th month of Finasteride, I started to notice the side effects. I was taking 1mg EOD, and at some point I had persistent pain at the right ball, one day it was so bad that I couldn't go hard with my girlfriend at all. I did a small pause of 2 weeks and then started to take 0.5mg EOD.   
My urologist threw a box of Cialis to me and told me to cease Finasteride, but hair...  
  
Things became better after I dropped the dosage, the pain was gone, I was able to collect the libido to have sex with my girlfriend. But, it's still pretty unstable and feels like a lottery.  
 I lost the morning wood, I lost the wood when I was going to sleep, I can't get hard by thinking, it takes a while to get hard on the porn, and when I defocus it goes soft very fast again. The thing itself feels half-dead and numb. It was never the case before...

I dropped the dosage again to 0.25 ED, got hair shed, and lost lots of gains on the crown, but things didn't get much better. I am so sad about this because my girlfriend is an amazing person, I love her so much. She says she doesn't care about the hair and she is fine with me being bald, it's better for her if I stop doing all these hair recovery experiments. Even my mum said I don't even joke about the sex anymore.

Also! The whole brain felt like in fog, memory in peaks was one huge hole, all the thoughts about suicide and I was crying a lot which is abnormal for me. Also,  I gained Àú15KG eating the same stuff as usual, I cook myself and avoid sweets, I am a tea lover, I don't do coffee, and even I think I got the breast to be bigger a bit than it used to be....

The only thing that had a potential effect was MACA and when I was taking Doxazosin I also got it from my urologist. 

Last week I was on a business trip and I skipped taking finasteride for 2 days. I was back home and I decided not to touch this thing for already like 1 week. I don't feel anything positive for now, probably too early.    
  
From what I see from reddit, it takes about 3-6 months in lucky cases to get better from what people say. The problem is, I am very afraid of PFS and what if I have already developed it... I miss this wish to have sex with everything that moves I used to have before...

I will really appreciate bits of advice and opinions of people who are also in the same situation. Can I ask you for any kind words, friendly advice on how to recover, and e.t.c. about its decommission?   
I am also considering doing blood tests, what should I include besides testosterone, estradiol, prolactin, globulin, T3, T4, Kortizol, Glucose, Vitamine D, cooper, Zink, Ferritin, Magnesium, cholesterol? DHT is not covered by the insurance in Vienna and it's done by AKH but they may not have the reactives, it happened before. The rest is fine, I will talk to the doctor. 

Also, since I have 6 packs of 1mg remaining, should I consider trying out the topical one? I have no idea what to do with the boxes. 

Thank you very much, everyone!

1jumnpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1jumnpo/is_she_lying/,Is she lying?,"TLDR; gf and I have agreed not to spend on extras much, and just to keep track if we do. Saw a receipt that she claims has the wrong date on it, and denies going anywhere and getting anything. Is she lying? Don‚Äôt care about the purchase; I care that she‚Äôs probably being dishonest.

I‚Äôm not sure where else to post this, so any feedback would be appreciated.

I‚Äôm definitely more of a trusting person, sometimes too much. My girlfriend has lied to me on a few occasions. Rarely anything big, not that that makes it okay.

We have a budget for each month because money is tight. A certain amount for each category. I‚Äôm not crazy strict about it, just try to adhere to it, and if we make an exception, let‚Äôs just do it consciously. 

Because she‚Äôs been dishonest in the past with this, spending a ton of money on coffee, eating out, etc., when we have agreed to do that only rarely, I‚Äôve just asked her to let me know when she does buy extra stuff so we can keep track. 

And also that if she is going to go somewhere, please try to use the car, not the truck, because we live rurally and the truck is way more expensive to drive anywhere. 

Today I was taking out the trash and saw a drink order receipt for yesterday. The date said April 7, time was 2:44. I was out at that time working. 

It seems to me that she went out and got stuff with the truck, and is now claiming the receipt has the wrong date on it, that she didn‚Äôt go anywhere. 

Asked AI, and they said it‚Äôs pretty rare for a restaurant‚Äôs labeling system to get it wrong. 

**How likely is it she is just lying to me?**

It‚Äôs not about the drink, or even taking the truck out when she shouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs that it‚Äôs another little lie she‚Äôs telling me, after I‚Äôve told her again and again that it‚Äôs okay to make mistakes, even given her free reign to just go get something for fun sometimes, just to be honest about it and let me know.

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

Sometimes I find myself complaining a LOT about the workload at my job. I‚Äôm an SSV and have been with the bux for 4 years. I have quit once and came back within 1 month. I have gotten 2nd jobs hoping to quit and move up in the other job 3 different times. And I have always come back.

I see this with a lot of other partners too. The amount of times I have picked up the phone and talked to a former partner asking if my store was hiring is crazy. I get paid well above minimum wage and way above the average entry level job hourly. 

Especially with the possible recession that is about to happen, I‚Äôve decided to change my perspective. I am extremely lucky to have a secure job. In the last recession in 2008 Starbucks actually GREW business. It‚Äôs because of coffee culture. People will never stop buying it. It is also considered a simple luxury during recessions. It‚Äôs kind of like the lipstick theory‚Äîlipstick sales increase during economic downturns.

The benefits are unlike anything you will find at any entry level job. Yes there are issues as there are issues with any job you will work ever. I know this subreddit is a place to dump all your pent up frustration but I just want to appreciate all the partners sticking it out and working this job.

DIETARY CHANGES

The first thing I did was stop drinking milk, I'm drinking just almond milk now. Cut coffee down to once a day.

My dermatologist told me to cut down energy drinks and soft drinks too, but I don't drink them anyways.


TOPICAL APPLICATORS

1. Lacto calamine face lotion at night
2. Lacto calamine 2% salicylic acid face serum in the morning followed by Elugia max lotion (for face, though it's a body lotion my derm told me it's really good as a face cream)
3. Fix derma scarfix-TX face serum.

I think it's a pretty good progress since I had been struggling with acne for s very long time.

Does it sound like it would be fun feel kind of afraid but then would before cooking together. Go get coffee or something first I guess.   I don't know really trying to learn and think of things

ive also been eating a LOT, and still feel extremely hungry. my period is supposed to come next week, but im scared it wont.

the cramps were worst around 4/1-4/5, and have calmed down a bit, but are now almost completely gone after ive gone to the bathroom. i havent really been frequently peeing, but i have been peeing when trying to n2, and my stomach is hard when i press down on it, and it growls and sloshes when i touch it. i can also feel my pulse in my stomach and it makes me wanna cry. please help i dont know what ill even do if im pregnant.

1julydn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1julydn/how_do_people_even_escalate_on/,How do people even escalate on restaurant/coffee/etc dates?,"Really having this question after an unprecedented - for me - string of first dates that went nowhere. 23M, reasonably attractive - peak of winter was a little dead, and sometimes I wasn‚Äôt using the apps because of burnout, but I can get approached on occasion and have no trouble getting multiple matches a week without paying for any app.

I‚Äôve noticed something. It could just be correlation, but on basically all of my ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô dates (lead to a hookup and/or 2nd date) at least one of these things were true:

1) The date started ‚Äòactive‚Äô / outside in some way. There was natural room for some movement and not just sitting across from each other. 

2) It was late at night and I ended up drunk. I feel like I might not be 100% attentive during dates or able to build chemistry even if I‚Äôm talking. There‚Äôs just too much in my head distracting me. I‚Äôm talking having a few shots before the date AND a few drinks to feel like I get to the point where instinct takes over and I have better odds.

But‚Ä¶

So many dates are just at a bar for happy hour, or a meal, or a coffee shop. I feel like women are looking for this mythical ‚Äòspark‚Äô to happen. When they take 5 seconds to actually text me back and say they didn‚Äôt feel it, I kind of do agree, but I don‚Äôt have that EXPECTATION that it‚Äôs supposed to emerge so quickly. I would say I can keep a solid conversation going and ask good questions but I just can‚Äôt create the expected tension in these environments. 

But it all feels so sterile. I might walk in and get a table for 2 and I‚Äôm literally seated across from them at a low-top. That sounds like just the environment for basic small talk ‚Äòfriend‚Äô conversations and I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs even supposed to transition to whatever I‚Äôm supposed to do as a heterosexual man.

And I‚Äôm socially expected to pay, $50+ just to get two cocktails or an entree each let alone anything more each time. Meanwhile they can just keep swiping and go through their hundreds of matches and 10 dates to get their ‚Äòspark‚Äô or whatever with no financial stake in the process. No time to even send a quick ‚Äòhey I didn‚Äôt feel it‚Äô but time to go back into infinite swiping.

I guess it complicates the whole active side of things that I live somewhere with awful weather. Yesterday, on April 7, it was barely above freezing during the day and everything was still dead. During close to 50% of the year if I want to do something on an evening I‚Äôm stuck with these awkward indoor dates.

Yesterday: Ausar Thompson o12.5 pts ‚úÖ

Today‚Äôs Picks ‚¨áÔ∏è

üî∏ **Brandin Podiemski o14.5 pts (-111)**
- Podiemski has cleared this line in his last 9/12 & 4/5 including 3 straight against the Lakers, Nuggets, & Rockets. In his last 5 games he‚Äôs avging 21.6 ppg on 14.4 shots per game. Lots of focus on him down the stretch in a high powered offense.
- Facing an easier defense tonight vs Suns. Suns have a bottom 3 defensive rating, look for Podiemski to take advantage. Warriors will be high energy needing a win here crucial for playoff seeding as it‚Äôs tied up with several teams.

üî∏ **Bub Carrington o18.5 pts + asts (-125)**
- Wizards have a depleted roster with tons of guys out with injuries, & Bub has taken advantage with tons of opps lately. He‚Äôs cleared this line in 3 straight avging 28.3 P+A and ~40 minutes per in this span.
- Look for Bub to stay hot & be able to clear this line on sheer volume alone.
- Some books already jumped to 19.5, I got this line on DK.

üî∏ **Lugentz Dort o12.5 pts+rbs (-108)**
- Dort is avging 14.2 P+R on the season & has cleared this line in his last 8/11, avging 16.7 P+R in that span. He‚Äôs also taken tons of threes with 4+ 3pt attempts in each of his last 11 games.
- I think the Thunder do blowout the Lakers tonight with tons of LA starters on the injury list, but Dort should still get his minutes. Dort has missed this in his last 2 games, but they were *losing* blowouts. Look for him & OKC to both bounce back tonight.

No titles, no claims, just lines on a page.
But God, I memorized your every word,
Even the ones you swore I never heard.

You‚Äôd message late, and I‚Äôd always reply,
Heart racing fast like a hummingbird‚Äôs cry.
I‚Äôd reread your texts like holy prose,
Like something sacred nobody knows.

And in that space, that in-between,
Where ‚Äúalmost‚Äù hides and ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù lean,
I built a world from scraps and sighs‚Äî
A home in the color of your eyes.

I told myself, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fall, not yet,‚Äù
But my heart tripped over every text you sent.
You called me ‚Äúfriend,‚Äù and I played along,
While writing sonnets in silence all night long.

You said, ‚ÄúI love talking to you, you‚Äôre sweet,‚Äù
And I smiled while dying beneath the seat.
You leaned on me when your skies turned grey,
Not knowing I‚Äôd give my soul away.

I kept my feelings wrapped in lace,
Carefully hidden behind my face.
Because what if I said, ‚ÄúI want you more,‚Äù
And you walked out, slammed the door?

So I stayed still, in soft retreat,
Carving love in lines discreet.
Loving you in lowercase,
While you chased hearts in other places.

Then came the blow‚Äîgentle and cruel:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like a sibling‚Äîmy golden rule.‚Äù
And my world, it cracked, but I just laughed,
Told you, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine,‚Äù while I broke in half.

I held your secrets, caught your tears,
Stayed your constant through the years.
While every smile you gave away
Was a needle that made me stay.

I loved you like a quiet art,
In midnight letters torn apart.
I kissed your name with every line,
In hopes you‚Äôd see the love was mine.

But you never did, or never will‚Äî
You‚Äôre chasing dreams, I‚Äôm standing still.
And though you never crossed that line,
You lived in every poem of mine.

Still, I can‚Äôt unlove you‚ÄîI‚Äôve tried.
I‚Äôve yelled, I‚Äôve cried, I‚Äôve kept it inside.
But every time I try to flee,
Some piece of you still clings to me.

You‚Äôre etched in places I can‚Äôt clean,
In coffee cups and movie scenes.
In songs I skip but never delete,
In empty corners of my sheets.

So now I write, like fools before,
Who loved too hard, and hoped for more.
You‚Äôll never read these pages torn,
These midnight thoughts where dreams are born.

But if you do‚Äîif fate allows,
If stars align and time somehow
Brings you across this fragile trail
Of broken hearts and hopeful mail‚Äî

You‚Äôll see the truth I dared not speak:
You were the high I couldn‚Äôt reach.
You were the sun behind my shade,
The almost-love that never stayed.

I won‚Äôt confess it face to face.
I‚Äôll love you from a safer place.
A distant moon, a watching star‚Äî
Not too close, but never far.

So here‚Äôs my vow, without a name:
I‚Äôll keep on loving you the same.

Alright, here's a detailed roast of ENFJ boys‚Äîthose charming, over-involved, save-the-world types:


---

Oh, ENFJ boys. The self-proclaimed ""empaths"" of the personality world. You walk into a room with the energy of a TED Talk and the emotional depth of a Disney movie monologue. Always trying to fix everyone‚Äôs lives like some bargain-bin therapist who read The Power of Now once and decided it was their calling.

You're the type to say, ‚ÄúI just want to help people,‚Äù but you can‚Äôt even decide what you want for dinner without calling a group meeting. You thrive on validation like it‚Äôs oxygen‚Äîif no one claps when you talk about your ""deep passion for connecting with others,"" you wither faster than a houseplant in a dark basement.

You think you're smooth because you compliment everyone and hold intense eye contact, but half the time it just feels like you're emotionally interrogating people. And let‚Äôs not ignore your need to be liked by everyone. Even the mailman. Even your ex‚Äôs new boyfriend. Bro, it‚Äôs okay to not be everyone's emotional support peacock.

You're allergic to emotional boundaries. If someone says ‚ÄúI'm fine,‚Äù you treat it like a personal quest: ‚ÄúNo, tell me. I can sense your pain.‚Äù No, Derek. Maybe I just don‚Äôt want to talk.

And you think you're mysterious because you hide your problems behind that ‚ÄúI'm always here for you‚Äù smile, but everyone knows you're one rejection away from crying into your guitar at 2AM, playing Ed Sheeran songs and texting your high school friends about ‚Äúhow much you‚Äôve grown.‚Äù

Want me to do a part two? Or roast another type?

ENFJ Boys, Part 2: The Sequel No One Asked For

So you‚Äôve returned for more, huh? Classic ENFJ behavior‚Äîcan't resist attention, even if it‚Äôs in the form of a roast. Let‚Äôs keep going.

You act like you‚Äôre too emotionally intelligent for drama, yet you are the drama. You‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúI hate conflict,‚Äù and then subtly manipulate everyone into a group therapy session because Sarah didn‚Äôt say thank you for your 3-paragraph good morning text.

You love talking about ‚Äúvibes‚Äù and ‚Äúenergy‚Äù like you're a spiritual guru, but we all know you just watched three TikToks on chakras and decided you're an emotional shaman now. Meanwhile, your own aura screams ‚Äúplease tell me I‚Äôm special‚Äù in neon lights.

You give relationship advice like you‚Äôve been married for 10 years, when in reality, your last three ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù were just month-long text-a-thons where the other person didn‚Äôt even know they were dating you.

And the way you flirt‚ÄîGod help us. Compliments, deep conversations, forehead touches like you're filming an indie romance... only to ghost someone because ‚Äúthe emotional connection wasn‚Äôt aligned with your soul‚Äôs purpose.‚Äù

You‚Äôll say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just really in tune with people,‚Äù while completely missing the fact that no one asked you to plan a surprise intervention for their self-esteem.

Also, your Google Calendar looks like a battlefield of color-coded chaos. ‚ÄúCoffee with Jess to check on her breakup,‚Äù ‚ÄúZoom call with my cousin to talk about her career,‚Äù ‚ÄúReflect on emotional growth at sunset.‚Äù Bro, ever heard of just... chilling?

Yesterday I planned on asking her out to coffee.  Got busy and it slipped my mind though.  Luckily she stopped by to talk anyway.

I was loading up the company van yesterday for today's tickets when she came over to chat while I worked.  Mostly small talk while I loaded boxes and did my paperwork.  She was on her way to her car to head home when she stopped by so before she left I asked if she'd be interested in grabbing coffee sometime and she countered with an offer to go try out the ice cream place down the road when I was done for the day.  

She came back when my shift was over and we met for milkshakes and sat around talking for a good while.  I was nervous at first, but she's remarkably easy to talk to.  We talked about our families, hobbies, jobs,  and had a rather passionate debate on the best trails to walk in the area.  So I proposed an outing this weekend to get our steps in and figure out who is right.  Numbers have been shared and even though she's off today and I don't get to see her we've been texting a bit.

I laid their sprawled on the floor like Carrie that night. My eyes wide open, my mouth agape, dripping vomit from my mouth with a plat onto the icy floor. I didn‚Äôt want to taste it. Taste her. 

I felt dead, I felt like I was in an icy hell with my own personal demons singing lullabies and chopping people up in front of me. I must have been a horrible person in my last life and I am surely paying for it now

Cricket did as Cricket always does. She stared back at me and didn‚Äôt blink. Sh was humming the same song and holding her protruding belly. 
 
I couldn‚Äôt help that she was copying my expression. Her mouth hung open as she hummed and her eyes didn‚Äôt falter from mine. It could have been easily the most horrifying thing I‚Äôve seen if I hadn‚Äôt experienced everything else this past week. 

My paralysis was interrupted as swiftly as it came. 

I felt the sting of cold air in my lungs as Sam‚Äôs grip dragged me back upstairs. I didn‚Äôt even hear him come down the steps, let alone hear cricket help in excitement as she saw him. I must be completely out of it. He came quick and quiet like a thief in the night. The only thing that made me realize it was him was the rough texture of his mask grazing against my cheek as he dragged me up. Im sure he must have seemed convinced that the horror of Carrie‚Äôs death would shake me into submission‚Äîreset my terror into compliance. But as we ascended the creaking stairs, my head buzzed with disbelief, and a spark of defiance flared within me.

I kicked and twisted, my legs barely holding me, and somehow flailed out of his grip once we hit the living room. I stumbled and slammed into the wall.

Silence.

We both froze‚Äîme panting, him just‚Ä¶ watching.

He tilted his head, his eyes fierce and amused. His breath was calm. My fight was nothing to him, I always considered myself a well fit person but I truly was powerless. 

Then, slowly, he turned his back to me and crouched by the fireplace, stoking the fire with careful consideration. 

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you worried I‚Äôm going to run?‚Äù I hissed, backing toward the door. ‚ÄúI did it before. I‚Äôll do it again.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did run before,‚Äù he said, not looking at me. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôll fail again.‚Äù

He tossed another log on the fire and stood. The flames lit up one side of his face, casting long, flickering shadows across the room.

‚ÄúIf you want to end up like Carrie, be my guest. You already made a mess of things. I have no will to stop now.‚Äù He turned to me, I could tell he was smiling widely underneath that mask. ‚ÄúBut please‚Ä¶ go ahead.‚Äù

Silence. 

My eyes darted to the door, then back to him. He made no move to follow.

But something in the room was different. On the kitchen table‚ÄîCarrie‚Äôs scarf. Folded neatly. Next to it, two bowls. One empty. The other half full of something dark and steaming.

The smell hit me. I didn‚Äôt want to know.
Even though I already did. 


I took a step toward the door. He didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he said softly, almost tenderly. ‚ÄúIf you freeze out there, I‚Äôll find you. I always do. Always will. This is your home now. Strays always make their way home.‚Äù

I shifted slowly over to the couch, every movement weighted and slow. The room was dim, the light of the fireplace painting along, ai half expected Carrie to swing by me and hand me a cup of coffee. I can still feel the ghost of her absence in every creak and whisper.

Across from me, Sam sat in his rickety chair. He clutched an old book, its pages dog-eared and stained, and his eyes‚Äîcold, measured‚Äîpeek over the top, locked on mine. The silence between us was thick and oppressive, broken only by the soft crackle of the fire. 

I swallowed the lump in my throat and managed to whisper, ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù Even the words feel foreign, heavy.

Without rising to meet my gaze fully, he closes his book with deliberate slowness. ‚ÄúA family,‚Äù he replies.

The weight of his words crashed down on me. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve thought about that before killing Carrie. She was your daughter right?,‚Äù I manage, a note of desperate fury trembling in my voice. ‚ÄúI have my own life, my own family. I don‚Äôt need a new one.‚Äù

Then he spoke again, mocking my whispered tone, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the reason Carrie is dead and YOUR family is in Kentucky. You‚Äôre alone now and you NEED a family. It was fate that I found you that day. Meant to be.‚Äù

I felt every word like a lash, and for a moment, my will faltered‚Äîmy heartbeat a frantic drum. I forced myself to focus, I never told them where my family was from, I never told them my name. Yet Carrie and Sam both knew it‚Ä¶how? 

The tension was absolute as I remained seated on the couch, my eyes not daring to stray from his. I‚Äôm caught in a fragile standoff‚Äîtrapped between a past I can‚Äôt escape and a future he insists is inescapable. 

Something inside me snapped. All the fear, the crushing guilt, and every suffocating word Sam had spoken converged into a single, irreversible act. Without a second thought, I sprang forward‚Äîevery muscle screaming with adrenaline‚Äîand drove a jagged metal shard, clutched tightly in my trembling hand, deep into his side.

The shard, rusted and sharp from months forgotten in the dark recesses of the basement, found its mark with devastating precision. I felt his body jerk. For an eternity‚Äîthough it was only a split second‚ÄîI could see the shock in his unblinking eyes. In that flicker, his mask of cold detachment cracked, revealing a flash of something raw and vulnerable beneath.

The sound of the shard piercing his flesh sounded like biting into an old orange. Squelching and soggy.  I heard my own ragged breath and the sickening thud as his chair toppled backward. Time seemed to stagger around us; for a heartbeat, everything stilled as if the very air recoiled at the violence.


I ran‚Äîand I mean I ran with everything I had. My lungs burned with the first gasp of cold, honest air, and my legs screamed under the weight of exhaustion and pain. But I didn‚Äôt stop. I couldn‚Äôt. I knew that wound was deep, but not deep enough to kill him. Not him.

To my luck, the door was unlocked. No deadbolts. No barricades. Just the creak of wood and the scream of hinges as it opened for me, as if the house itself was just as desperate to let me go.


The wilderness swallowed me whole: moonlight reflected off frozen branches and the snow crunched underfoot in an almost hypnotic rhythm. My heart pounded wildly as I stumbled through a landscape of barren trees and wind-whipped drifts, a desperate casualty of endless winter. 

Then I passed the very fallen tree where I was caught last time. I pushed my legs faster a newfound strength in me I didn‚Äôt know I was capable of. 

Every step carried a mix of raw terror and fierce determination. I dodged between gnarled trunks and slippery slopes, the cold biting at my exposed skin, until gradually, exhaustion forced me to pause. My mind spun with both relief and dread‚ÄîI had escaped one horror, only to be plunged into the inky unknown.

I forced myself to press on, driven by the faint hope that somewhere, somehow, I‚Äôd find shelter. The wilderness stretched for miles, devoid of sign or comfort, until I spotted a dark shape half-buried in the drifts. Drawn to it like a moth to a dying flame, I crept closer.

At first glance, it appeared to be nothing more than a decrepit structure hidden amid the frozen wasteland. As I neared, the shape took on a more sinister form‚Äîa heavy, bolted door set into a concrete wall. My pulse pounded as I reached out a trembling hand. There was no turning back now.

I pushed the door open and stepped inside, the musty air of abandonment slamming into me. Before me lay a vast underground bunker, its corridors dimly lit by failing fluorescent lights. The silence was overwhelming, punctuated only by the echo of my ragged breathing and the distant drip of water against cold concrete.

I remembered my grandfather told me stories from the 40s or 50s about hidden bunkers in Alaska‚Äîconstructed during the war and abandoned soon after. For a brief, bitter moment, the thought crossed my mind: maybe I‚Äôd just stumbled upon a forgotten gold mine. But I wasn‚Äôt naive enough to believe that Sam hadn‚Äôt come across this before. He‚Äôs definitely lived in that cabin for ages. No way he doesn‚Äôt know about this place. 

For a long, disoriented moment, I wandered the labyrinthine hallways, searching for any semblance of safety. Every door felt like a potential portal to further horror, each shadow concealing unspeakable secrets. As I rounded one corner, I caught sight of a large, cavernous room‚Äîthe layout of a living room out of place in this decaying edifice.

There, an old dusty television sat silent. A leather couch stood in the center, its once inviting cushions now defiled by time and neglect.

In that moment, the bunker‚Äôs duality struck me: within these walls lay a deceptive promise of shelter, yet every inch reeked of cold indifference and hidden cruelty. I sank down against a damp wall, the weight of my exhaustion matched only by the dread coursing through me. Here, in this underground refuge, I was alone with the ghosts of a forgotten past‚Äîand the unrelenting terror of what might still lie ahead. But at least I was away from him. 

At least this time I had the upper hand. I went back to the door and noticed it had bolts and locks of all kinds. They were frozen to the touch and rusted but if I could get them to lock back up I would be safe for now. 

I also knew that there was potentially a whole armory of things I could use in here to protect myself. I hadn‚Äôt explored behind the doors yet but there had to be something.

1jullo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/kaiwaJapanese/comments/1jullo1/coffee_shop_ordering_scenario_with_natural/,Coffee Shop Ordering Scenario with Natural Japanese Dialogue,"Japanese rhythm really shines in everyday scenarios like ordering at a coffee shop. As a native Japanese speaker, I've found that these practical situations are perfect for practicing that musical flow we talked about.

Here's a natural coffee shop dialogue that highlights the rhythmic patterns of Japanese speech:

**Customer:** Konnichiwa! Houtto k≈çhƒ´ to cheesukƒìki o onegai shimasu. („Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØÔºÅ„Éõ„ÉÉ„Éà„Ç≥„Éº„Éí„Éº„Å®„ÉÅ„Éº„Ç∫„Ç±„Éº„Ç≠„Çí„ÅäÈ°ò„ÅÑ„Åó„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ)

**Barista:** Kashikomarimashita. O-namae o oshiete itadakemasu ka? („Åã„Åó„Åì„Åæ„Çä„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ„ÅäÂêçÂâç„ÇíÊïô„Åà„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åü„Å†„Åë„Åæ„Åô„ÅãÔºü)

**Customer:** Sara desu. („Çµ„É©„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ)

**Barista:** Tanaka-sama, kochira de o-machi kudasai. O-nomimono ga dekimashitara o-yobi shimasu. (Áî∞‰∏≠Êßò„ÄÅ„Åì„Å°„Çâ„Åß„ÅäÂæÖ„Å°„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ„ÄÇ„ÅäÈ£≤„ÅøÁâ©„Åå„Åß„Åç„Åæ„Åó„Åü„Çâ„ÅäÂëº„Å≥„Åó„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ)

Notice how each line follows that wave-like intonation pattern I mentioned before. The pitch rises slightly on certain syllables (like the ""chi"" in ""konnichiwa"") and gently falls toward the end of sentences.

Try practicing this dialogue using the three techniques from my previous post:

1. Focus on the wave-like flow
2. Keep even timing for each mora
3. Use clear, open vowels like in Italian

What makes this dialogue sound natural isn't just the words but the musicality. Japanese service conversations have a particular rhythm - polite, flowing, and with gentle pitch changes rather than stress emphasis.

Have you tried role-playing everyday scenarios to practice Japanese intonation? What situations do you find most helpful for developing that natural rhythm?

As of today our little one is 6 weeks. So far he‚Äôs appears to be a healthy little boy, for which we are very thankful as we are both past 40. 

He‚Äôs generally a cute little kid but has a very spicy temperament, where he gets mad at things, fast and LOUD. He doesn‚Äôt cry he shrieks, putting himself into a rage fit with hiccups and all, choking on his saliva typically making it worse for himself in the process. He refuses to sleep on his back, and pretty much sleep at all unless he‚Äôs on someone‚Äôs chest. At any given one moment there is at most 1 correct way to hold him and that correct position changes faster than you can figure it out typically‚Ä¶ you get the picture 

I am a very mild tempered, calm and patient person. Have been most of not all my life. Mom tells me I was an easygoing child too. I am an uncle to three nephews by blood, and many others through friendships. Never had any difficulties handling infants or toddlers, so you see I was fairly optimistic on our chances. Feeling SUCH a deep regret and disappointment at how we landed, and I know I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way and be thankful and that‚Äôs when good ol shame comes knocking on the door. 

Here I am feeling at the end of my wits, as my wife is trying to put our baby to sleep for the past 2-3 hours, after him waking up whatever many times, while our dinner is getting cold in the kitchen.. all this following what was a very nice bath which he seemingly loved, so we thought he might sleep nicely for once. Nope! 

People keep telling you it gets better, they keep telling you about all the things you definitely should or absolutely shouldn‚Äôt do‚Ä¶ like none of it really works out here. I want to scream F U to all these people with their best advice, or top whatever lists. 

Which brings me to the last bit: I don‚Äôt know if the sleep deprivation or stress of lagging back more and more at work or feeling a massive disappointment or particular pitch-perfect shrieks of the baby but I find myself very much on the edge I‚Äôm like angry all the time, at everybody. Can‚Äôt get much/any sleep (despite wife taking the night shift especially) because I am jacked up from the coffee and the adrenaline washing over my poor neurons the whole day.

I somehow thought it would be easier than this, and I would actually be enjoying to spend time with my child, rather than feeling like I want to run away..

Thanks for reading this far, and god bless

The idea is that it could work as some initiation to rp to some people, or just something that will make us different than every other place (you know, so you get some company with this little book!).

Other option that I'm looking for is some... Journalism? I'm not really sure about this terms (yesterday I discovered that solo rp games exist, I'm really new to this :D), but I've read Brave Sparrow and thought it could be a cute/fun little thing to do, you know, just going out to complete some tasks.

  
We already have tabletop games, but those usually need someone else to play, and including solo rp games we may have some personality put into the place. I mean, The Last Tea Shop sounds great in the context of a shop and seems easy enough to learn, I want more of that!

I'm a bit of a coffee dork.

Was an early adopter of Aeropress, Chemex, my daily is a Moccamaster, and I roast my own beans.

Decided I want to get away from plastic on my daily brew, so explored options.

I've never had French Press, Frieling is plastic free so I thought I'd give it ago.

For the life of me, I can't get a decent cup out of it.

I've tried various grind sizes, brew times, I've stirred, experimented a little bit with temp... but every cup just tastes kinda weak and flat.

My typical brew looks something like this:

\-680g water / 40g coffee  
\-Course grind  
\-30s bloom  
\-30s stir  
\-Steep for 5 minutes  
\-Gently plunge and pour

A genuine connection. I‚Äôm not chasing labels or rushing into anything just open to something built on trust, depth, and presence. If it turns into a relationship, great. If it becomes a meaningful friendship, that‚Äôs just as valuable.

A bit about me:

By day, I‚Äôm a coder. I also have a master‚Äôs degree in nuclear physics and I‚Äôm preparing for my PhD which means lots of studying and a few late-night brain farts (GRE & TOEFL). Life can be intense, but I balance it with calm moments and simple joys.

I love long conversations over coffee, night walks, and getting lost in the quiet parts of a city. I prefer the hidden alleys where the real stories live.

One day, I will ride a motorcycle across Europe. The back seat‚Äôs open. maybe you‚Äôre the right kind of adventure?

Still planning my first tattoo, but first, I‚Äôm working on getting in shape. Got any ideas or cool ink stories? I‚Äôm all ears.

What I‚Äôm looking for:

Emotional maturity. Calm, kind energy. A connection where we can be real, not perform. I‚Äôm not into surface-level stuff. Just looking for someone who enjoys depth, curiosity, and the kind of quiet that doesn‚Äôt need to be filled.

I‚Äôm crushing it, moving up the ranks like I‚Äôm the LeBron James of used Hondas. Sold 25 cars in 90 days‚Äî25! I‚Äôm the guy you want handing you the keys. But I quit. Why? Oh, I'll tell you why.

The job itself? Brutal. Long hours, 12-hour shifts, and it‚Äôs a shark tank in there‚Äîevery salesman‚Äôs ready to elbow you out of the way for the next commission. Normal dealership stuff, you know, just another day selling minivans to soccer moms I reckon. Except for this one thing. This batshit crazy thing that happened 3, 4 times a day after a while. And it‚Äôs why I ultimately walked out the door.

They had this radio station blasting through the whole place‚Äîall day, every day. Sounds fine, right? Wrong. It‚Äôs the most obnoxious station imaginable. You know those cheesy songs that latch onto whatever‚Äôs hot that week? Like, ‚ÄúOh, the Olympics are on, here‚Äôs a pop song about pole vaulting!‚Äù That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre dealing with. It‚Äôs grinding my soul down, one auto-tuned lyric at a time.

But then, there‚Äôs this one song: Justin Timberlake‚Äôs ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Stop the Feeling.‚Äù You know it, ‚ÄúDance, dance, dance!‚Äù Cute little tune, until it turns my coworkers into lunatics. Every time that chorus hits‚Äîevery damn time‚Äîall the salesmen and managers leap out of their chairs and start slamming into the walls. I‚Äôm not kidding! Full-body, no-shame, just BAM!‚Äîcrashing into whatever wall‚Äôs closest like they‚Äôre training for the Wall-Smashing Olympics.

Imagine this: I‚Äôm with a customer, like, ‚ÄúYeah, this pickup‚Äôs got towing power,‚Äù and then‚Äî‚ÄúDance, dance, dance!‚Äù‚Äîmy co-worker Steve next to me hurls himself into the wall like it‚Äôs his life‚Äôs calling.

I‚Äôm over here, mid-sentence, like, ‚ÄúUh, yeah, so about that warranty,‚Äù while the office looks like a scene from Jackass.

Was it a prank? A secret handshake? A mass hallucination? I have no clue! But it tanked business. Customers would walk in, see a guy in a cheap suit pancaking himself against the wall, and they be like, ‚ÄúYou know what? I‚Äôll just keep my ‚Äô98 Corolla, thanks.‚Äù And me? I couldn‚Äôt join in. That song comes on, and I‚Äôm just standing there, stone-faced, like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not concussing myself for Justin Timberlake, you weirdos.‚Äù

Everything else about the gig was fine‚Äînormal hours, normal cars, normal coffee. But that wall-jumping nonsense? Nope. Couldn‚Äôt do it.

**Day 1 ‚Äì Thursday 4/3: Alice & White Rabbit Bounds** We hit the ground running at **8:50am** in Disneyland. First ride? The **Disneyland Railroad** for a full circle‚Äîclassic way to ease in. Then it was corn dogs at **Little Red Wagon** (breakfast of champions).

We powered through **Fantasyland dark rides**‚ÄîSnow White, Pinocchio, Toad, Peter Pan, and Alice (which broke down halfway through). Took a riverboat cruise, then played **musical chairs with Alice and the Mad Hatter** near Jolly Holiday around noon‚Äîseriously charming and highly recommend if you stumble across it.

Afternoon hits:

* **Jungle Cruise**, Dole Whip & coffee breaks
* **Haunted Mansion (LL)**, **Pirates**
* **Galaxy‚Äôs Edge**: Rise, Falcon, and drinks at Oga‚Äôs Cantina
* Evening: Canal Boats, Big Thunder (LL), dinner at **Tiana‚Äôs (super spicy gumbo!)**
* **Hyperspace Mountain**, **Star Tours**, **Dumbo**, and we ended with **Runaway Railway**

**Day 2 ‚Äì Friday 4/4: Ghost Bride & Hatbox Ghost Bounds** Started in **California Adventure** with brunch at **Lamplight Lounge**. Hit **Midway Mania**, **Incredicoaster**, and the girls did swings while we grabbed corn dogs at **Corn Dog Castle** (not as good as LRW, imo).

Highlights:

* **Cars (LL)**, **Philharmagic**, **Web Slingers**
* Drinks at **Pym‚Äôs**, then **Guardians x2** (once standby, once LL)
* Park hopped to Disneyland for Big Thunder, Jungle Cruise, Pirates, Haunted, Rise, Falcon, and **Teacups**
* Ended with **Trader Sam‚Äôs** after lockers + Monorail ride. Vibes were perfect.

**Day 3 ‚Äì Saturday 4/5: Knott‚Äôs... sigh** This was rough. First, wife lost her phone at breakfast. Then Knott‚Äôs had weird ticketing issues‚Äî$40 extra per ticket due to an error on their part.

It was **hot**, crowded, and most rides had absurd waits. We grabbed some beer with berries for the **Boysenberry Festival**, wandered a bit, but overall it was a letdown. Ended up heading back early, then salvaged the night with another trip to **Trader Sam‚Äôs**.

  
**Day 4 ‚Äì Sunday 4/6: Donald & Daisy Bounds** Late start, but we packed in a great last day:

* **Alice**, Red Rose Tavern lunch
* **Big Thunder**, **Haunted Mansion**, **Runaway Railway**
* Bounding pics with Pete, Donald, and Daisy!
* Canal Boats, more **corn dogs**, **Jungle Cruise**, **Matterhorn**, **Smuggler‚Äôs**, **Rise**, another **Haunted**, and finally the **Disneyland Railroad** to New Orleans Square.
* One last Big Thunder, shopping, and **Pirates** to close it out.

Sorry for wall of text.","I never considered myself an alcoholic. I actually was able to be very responsible with alcohol in my 20s and 30s. I am 43 now and the last 5 years have had me and my SO slowly drinking more and more. We never got black-out-drunk, but we were drinking a few every night at home. We tried several times to cut back and only drink on the weekends, but we would always slowly start weeknight drinking again.

The thought of ""forever"" kept me from wanting to take a serious look at our problem. The idea that we were both functioning adults made it harder to realize that we did not need this poison in our lives. It took me going for a late-night cruise in my favorite car (Subaru BRZ) and totaling it while buzzed for me to realize that I had a problem. That was in November of 2024 and we both made the decision to quit drinking. We both have not had a sip since that night.

In those first days, I felt a similar feeling as when I quit cigarettes. It was almost a feeling or mourning the death of a friend. During the day I would have thoughts of never going to our local beer house again. I would reminisce about our vacations when we would visit breweries and take unique brews back to camp and bring huge hauls of beer home that we could never get locally. The thought of never doing these things ever again made me sad. I took the advice of this sub and reframed it in my head as ""just not today"".

I would have dreams where I would have a beer, and I would be in a panic when I woke up thinking I had slipped. The dreams still happen, but they are much less frequent and I usually pour out the beer before realizing I am in a dream.

I created a list of things I need to get done around the house and when I would normally watch TV and open a beer, I tackled an item on the list. So far I have fixed all the broken things around the house I was ignoring (leaking hose bib, leaking irrigation, uneven pavers, etc). I have fixed all the maintenance items that stacked up over the years on my Gen7 Celica (O2 sensor, rad hoses, ball-joints, bushings, oil leak, etc). All these things have been cheaper than a month of drinking craft beer.

My SO and I are getting along better than ever. We used to have stupid fights about unimportant stuff. Now we wake up early, have coffee, and start our days clear-headed and energized. We have both lost weight (I am down to 158lbs from 195lbs), our skin is clearer, and our gut biome is much happier (no more booze poops). We are saving money and adding years (quality years) to our lives. At this point I am no longer craving any alcohol. I am much more easily able to recognize it as a poison that I never have to have again (similar to how I feel about cigarettes now). I don't want a sip the same as I don't want a puff.

I recognize that my journey has been easier than a lot of other folks on here, but I wanted to share my story about how much our lives have improved and how we never felt like we had a problem until we quit entirely. The thought of ""forever"" is no longer daunting, but exciting. It feels good to have a partner who, without hesitation, joined me in my sobriety and recognizes the good that has come along with it. You don't need to hit rock-bottom to decide to make a change.

My shop is seasonal and I'm only open from late summer to Easter and work on making items for my shop all summer to get ready for the holidays.

I feel like I am at a loss for ideas for what to make and need some suggestions for gift items made both in wood and card stock paper?  

Other than my handmade Christmas ornaments, I have been more of a craft supplier for other makers.  I have a laser and have cut and painted Christmas ornaments but I am also a paper crafter and my biggest sales have been mostly die cuts and embellishments for other paper crafters to add to their own designs (cards/scrapbook pages).  

I plan to expand my laser designs this summer to offer more items in wood- just not sure what?  I feel like tech accessories are not a good option since they seem to be saturated.  I love my vinyl record collection and I hear vinyl is getting popular again- so I plan to come up with some ideas in this niche. 

Here is what I have tried that have not sold well for me:

Bookmarks (and bookmark gift sets- packaged nicely with a printed reading list)

Hot Cocoa/Tea/Coffee packets as stocking stuffers or co-worker gifts

Treat bags/boxes/favors - mostly as holiday gifting and as stocking stuffers

Any ideas that I have not thought of would be appreciated.

I and my SO have started a family in her country and I moved away about one year ago. 

Over the past several years I have tried to be more calm when dealing with my father and not to let his actions or words ""get to me"". This is the third time he has visited us during this period. This visit has left my SO and mother-in-law exhausted, and I with a lot of stress and negative memories resurfacing. 

I believe that therapy would be a good option to deal with the issues I have had growing up with such a parent, as I am afraid that I may exhibit some of the same traits if I don't unlearn them. I have gone to therapy before, but never confronted the issues that I had growing up or with my father. I am especially afraid for my young child - that she is not raised in the same environment that I was and that I do not pass on the negative experiences that I have had. 

Secondly, I would like to ask - if a narc parent does not, will not and has historically *never* respected boundaries, is the only solution to end contact with them? Would this mean ending contact with my extended family if they, too, have regular contact with him? These are people who I love and have good relationships with, and who I would greatly miss. Are there any others here that could share similar experiences, what their first steps were and how they have progressed over the years? 

Has anyone restricted their parent's access to their grandchild due to narc behaviour, or have any strategies on how to do so? 

During the time he was here, my father talked non-stop about what a great father he was to my mother-in-law and to my SO's family; how he took my sibling and I to do all sorts of activities (my parents are divorced and my mother took us to these activities). When I asked him ""who else took us to these activities"", these talking points stopped, as our mother was our primary caretaker, took us to all of our appointments and activities, was the only one to buy us clothes, get our haircut, meet our teachers etc. My parents had an ugly divorce and my father tried to do everything possible to slander my mother to my sibling and I and to our families. At the time of the trial he attempted to have his relatives slander my mother to have us taken away from her (they did not do so). My father talks constantly about what a great father and man that he is, despite having had several adulterous relationships, drove around in a car with a rear door kept closed by a bungee cord and duct tape, never turned the heating or cooling on in the house to 'save money' (he is by no means materially challenged).

Another night he was out with our child for less than 5 minutes on the balcony. During this time he started smoking a cigarette and let them wander off into some plants and she started digging around. When I noticed and took my child back inside there was no response other than a shrug and an eye roll.

He had a camera in my young child's face non-stop and was constantly taking photos and videos and sending them out to his friends who I and my SO only know peripherally, including a woman he is talking to who neither I nor my SO have ever met. We asked him kindly to stop on numerous occasions and this was followed up by ""why"" and then ""well what if I am in the photo/video"", ""well I am only sending them to so and so..."". When my SO remained firm he had a fit, smoked a few cigs on the balcony and then did not speak to her again for the rest of the night. 

We live in a country where my SO's mother and her entire family were threatened to be deported in the 1970s by popular vote (all foreigners were to be forcefully deported if the vote passed). She shared a storey about how her classmates were teasing her and saying that she would be gone soon, that her family had their bags packed awaiting the result of the vote, and about her feelings of alienation. My father jumped in, compared this to being teased for his foreign (which is a European) last name in the country we grew up in, and how it inspired him to start a business. The topic then shifted to said business and how ""you need to hustle"" etc etc. 

On the date of his departure there was an issue with the early online check-in - he was so furious that he was saying that he was going to throw his phone against the wall and break his laptop. Then he went to make a coffee on our stove , turned on the wrong burner (which had a plate on it), left it on until the stove was smoking and the plate burning. I asked him to be more careful and he told me that I was being a jerk for being annoyed with him! ""What to you want me to do, turn back time?"" ""Well then I guess I wont visit anymore or come and stay in a 'neutral' place."" (whatever this means) Last visit he ashed his cigs in our herb garden and broke our vacuum cleaner and we got the same response. The damage was not the issue, but the fact that this constantly happens and there is no remorse or real apology. I said that his actions made my SO and I feel like he has no regard for our feeling or our space. This was ignored. 

This visit did not contain the worst interactions that I/we have had with my father, but every time I interact with him a flood of all passed issues and event washes over me, and every time he visits my SO and child suffer. I am unsure of how to proceed at this time and have not yet looked thoroughly into therapy options. Any comment or advice would be appreciated, and I apologize for the lack of structure of this post.

  
**Additional rant / vent to follow:**

Once he shot a movie for his friends birthday with my sibling and I in it. My sibling was young and did not want to cooperate. My father berated him to the point of tears, filmed his ""scenes"" with my sibling in tears and then posted the video to facebook for his friend to see. 

My sibling was driven to the point of tears many times. They struggled with weight issues in their youth and would be forced to the point of exhaustion and belittled for his body, including being called the 'F' and 'P' words. 

My father never stops talking. Mostly about himself, and if he asks a question, it leads into a conversation about something or someone that he knows. There is never a moment of quiet or peace. If he is not talking, he is singing/whistling a song , usually the same song for an entire day/several days. If he is not whistling he is playing music on his phone or laptop out loud for the whole house. Kindly ask to turn the music off? The volume is turned down by 2-3 notches. Ask again? ""Why are you so sensitive"" or ""you need to learn how to relax"". These are his typical responses to any ""critique"" of his behaviour. If you don't want to be treated or spoken to a certain way - it is your problem for being too sensitive.

The man never respected a boundary - ever. No room or space was off limits and he would come in and start talking. If we were changing or in the bathroom, the line was ""what, I used to change you, I have seen you naked before"". 

If we were in our rooms, he would come in and usually go off about how we needed to work hard, chastise us for not reading enough, lie about needing A's in elementary schools because ""universities look at your elementary school grades"". If he was asked to leave or give us some space this was met with a fit ""why should I leave"" ""I am just making conversation"" ""no, I want to keep talking"" etc etc, usually ending up in shouting and put-downs. 

Once he took my shoes to stop me from leaving the house after an argument and I went around the city barefoot to get back to my mother's house. 

He would bring us to homeless encampments and said that we would end up like this if we did not study, take us to ""industry parties"" when we were 11 and 7 (sometimes at bars) and encouraged us to listen to the adults speak to that we could ""learn something"" from the adult conversations (usually about booze or women). 

Once we went to a pizza place with some family members and family friends. A woman (who was married with children) said that she was coming by and my father had a crush on her. Everyone else left but my father kept waiting with my sibling (age 10 or so at the time) until my sibling insisted on going home because he was tired. My father called my godfather to bring my sibling back home to an empty house where he waiting until midnight for my father to return home. I later learned that he had an affair with this woman.

When the movie Whiplash came out he took my sibling (age 12-13 at the time) to see it and used it as a an example about how hard work leads to success (completely missing the message of the movie). 

Once we had an argument in the car where I was being yelled at and put down. I got out of the moving car and ran through a park. He circled the park with the car trying to find me. 

Once I was taken away from his shared custody for a few weeks. He would show up at my school after it was over and wait for me to come out, asking when he could see us again in front of my friends. This was when I was 12.

We enjoyed movies, TV, or music that he did not like ? It had ""no creativity"" or was a ""waste of time"" and we were belittled for our interests.

I‚Äôm someone who loves the balance between getting outside and staying active, hiking, running, working out, you name it, but I also appreciate the quiet moments, like a rainy afternoon spent baking cookies or sipping coffee in a cozy cafe. Life's all about finding joy in the little things, right?

I‚Äôm big on authenticity and emotional maturity, especially when navigating the ups and downs of life, and I try to bring both of those things into my relationships.

I‚Äôm also big on comfort when it comes to connecting with people. I want to be able to relax, be myself, and have open, easy conversations that don‚Äôt feel rushed or forced. It‚Äôs about creating a space where things flow naturally, without any pressure.

So, if you are up for some interesting chats, or perhaps a bit of baking or hiking if when we connect well, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Maybe this time we will both find something a little more positive.",1,1744137217.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Subject: Nicholas ‚ÄòWilliam‚Äô Ulery

Clearance level: Command, Logistics

Species:Human\]

Date \[Standardized Sol Time\]: July 25th, 2464  


Well shit‚Ä¶ put on the spotlight.

Alright, a simple expedition, shouldn't be too hard right?

‚ÄúI will see who I can gather for it, I should have it ready within the next day.‚Äù I say‚Ä¶ half-truthfully‚Ä¶ a expedition for sample gathering and setting up a outpost takes more than a day to‚Ä¶ gather, but I suppose some corners can be cut and done.



‚ÄúExcellent! I-I cant wait to hear what is happening down there.‚Äù The pale Research Director simply says, as her eyes light up a bit, before clearing her throat and‚Ä¶ going back to her meek self. ‚ÄúR-Right, that is all I have to say, uh‚Ä¶ m-meeting dismissed?‚Äù



With those words, everyone started moving, going to their separate department as did I.



\[Shift Action Report timelapse: 10 minutes.\]



As the airlock opens I‚Ä¶ am finally in my element, looking around the cargo bay it seems they had another bender, oil, vomit‚Ä¶ half empty cans.



Atleast they find time to enjoy themself.



Clearing my throat‚Ä¶. noone answers, but with another one this time a bit‚Ä¶ louder, my crew started to shuffle, some still having rosy cheeks and others wearing sunglasses or blindfolds-



Why does he have a muzzle??



Opening my mouth to speak I am suddenly stopped by common sense. ‚ÄòIgnorance is bliss‚Äô.



Ignoring that, I look at them before clapping my hands, causing one of the vulpakin to cover their ears. ‚ÄúRight, lets start cycling the shuttle, the custodial team was kind enough to provide coffee and hang-over helpers, they are over by the vendor.‚Äù



Pointing to the right where the wardrobe vendor is found and‚Ä¶ it seems someone has already taken all of it.



Mother fucker‚Ä¶



‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ it seems someone has stolen it‚Ä¶ nevertheless the shift is starting up again, come on people.‚Äù Riling people up for cargo work was easy, as all one had to do was simply‚Ä¶ push crates.

Of course I had to do more like ensure the shuttle is fueled for a return trip and approve orders, but simple when you get the hang of it.

With a long shooming sound the shuttle left, as the crew like bees started walking around and pushing everything where it needed to go.

I am proud of them all-

bzzt

Pain, discombobulation, confusion, shock. Going through all these was not what I had though I would be going through in a short time.



Twisting my back as I heard my joints pop there HE was.



‚ÄúPiezo‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúNicholas.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy shouldnt I?‚Äù



‚ÄúReason why you are here?‚Äù



‚ÄúFor a order.‚Äù



‚ÄúShould be here.‚Äù



As if on cue a cargo technician walked by and presented a case to Piezo, handing it to him before they scamper off to help with the engineering crates.



The ethereal crackles with energy before bowing down, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Came a simple reply before he walked off, slapping the airlock on the way out with his hand, causing that audible crackle of energy as he went off.



Letting out a sigh as I looked down at my PDA, opening the Crew Manifest, looking over everyone I checked over their skills and abilities, aswell as downsides which were listed, skimming through it and randomly picking names to read.



First one on the list was Noelle Basmanoff, a genemodder, third generation, great people talking skills, 30/30 eyesight, taller side, genemods cause them to‚Ä¶ become a ‚ÄòLamia‚Äô? Hmm‚Ä¶



Lamia, a humanoid creature with the bottom half of a snake, found originally in the 22‚Äônd century, with multiple colonies having a pure genemodded population to gain an advantage over the terrain and local fauna.



Curious‚Ä¶ but no people will be found there likely, will tag you, the genemods may prove useful.



Next one‚Ä¶ Alexander Kholer ‚ÄúThe hon-



Nope, skip.



Ah wait‚Ä¶



Seen-Shavee, Tiziran, Red scales, Northern province, Great medical skills, xenobiology and quick learner, cold-intolerant, air-headed, sensitive olfactory senses above average, surplus prosthetic leg‚Ä¶



Gonna tag you for a possibility.



Who is next‚Ä¶ 



Arsenic I, Plasmaman, focus on tasks, workacholic, atmospheric requirement, no sleep or food required, lacking in emotional expression, 10/10 eyesight‚Ä¶ engineering skills, motor assisted suit.



Tagged for the team‚Ä¶



I continue reading out names and abilities before tagging and writing their names or skip them for others.



\[Shift Action Report timelapse: 20 minutes.\]



Alright‚Ä¶  8 people‚Ä¶ should be enough.



One for each department so to speak with extras incase anything happens.



I shoot a PDA message to Anne, ‚ÄúHey, I am done picking the list, here it is.‚Äù



As I get out of my office and head into the cargo bay I see people more lively now that they arent suffering from the hangover as much.



Taking a deep breath I smile before heading over to the shuttle which is currently being cycle‚Äôd by the same cargo Technician that gave Piezo their package, cycling the shuttle and closing the blast doors with that resounding chunk as they close.



‚ÄúHey, Molly are you done? Need to put in a custom order.‚Äù



Turning around the Human girl looked at me wide eye‚Äôd as she done it a little too fast and slipped, wincing as I see her land on the floor with a thud.



‚ÄúU-Uh yeah! I am done! B-Boss sir!‚Äù She says while getting back onto her feet, cleaning off her jumpskirt from the dirt it has gathered from the floor looking‚Ä¶ quite disheveled.



‚ÄúTake a break, clean yourself up.‚Äù Letting the words rang out for a moment as she stands there‚Ä¶ trying to think of a reply, before running off without a word except for a subtle nod as the metal clacks underneath.



Alright‚Ä¶ what was it that I was going to order‚Ä¶?



Ah right, a flat-pack fabricator, flat-packed RTG, flat-packed battery silo, all Nakamura Industry design‚Ä¶ 



As I type away at the console, putting the orders in I feel‚Ä¶ anxious, the deadline approaching‚Ä¶



Why? Why now? Its a normal expedition‚Ä¶ surely- surely nothing bad will happen.



Right?



The flickering lights of the console knock me out of my stupor as I continue ordering extra buildings and facilities required for the expedition.



Surely right‚Ä¶?

[Delonghi Dedica and Eureka Mignon Specialita],"Hey guys, owner of a delonghi dedica here that i recently paired up with an Eureka Mignon Specialita.

I have bought a bottomless portafilter and a single dose and double dose basket.

I have dialed in with the single dose basket, it works well, i get 10g in and 25g out in about 28 seconds. 
I know 1:2,5 may be a bit long for some here, but i like the taste. My beans are an italien roast, so on the darker side with 20% robusta.

When i use the same settings on the grinder and fill my double shot basket with 18g, it takes way longer to reach my 1:2,5 ratio, like 45+seconds.

So here comes my question: the diameter of both baskets is the same, the double dose basket is of course way deeper. So its no surprise that is takes the water longer to go through double the coffee and a double as thick puck. Isnt it?

So are you supposed to grind coarser in a double shot? Or what am i missing?
Sorry if its a silly question, just trying to understand and to dial in correctly.

She taught for a couple semesters after accumulating $50k in debt plus $30k in CC's.  She could not handle teaching again and decided to hang it up.  I support her 1000% because that was pure hell for her.

Fast forward a year, she has a job with the county 6 months of the year and stays at home over the winter.  The pay sucks but she gets to be outside for a job which is great and has extra spending money.

She does not have to work and gets to stay at home for the other 6 months, she acts like its such a horrible thing.  Mind you this is her chosen path.  The house can easily stay maintained cleanliness- wise with 1-2 hours of work per day, but she lets it accumulate and then blows up on me.   I pull more than my own weight and get the kids and animals rolling every day so she does not have to lift a finger until she wants to.  The kids have all their assigned chores and just need reminders, they really are great.

 She still goes out every morning for coffee and breakfast, she can literally do as she pleases.

Once the kids come in the door from the bus she all the sudden starts yelling at everyone and just cannot seem to handle life.  These 6 months are such a drag because she is so angry and extra resentful towards me.  I don't bother her with any of my burdens and she just flat out cannot be happy year round but it is worse in the winter.

Kids are all self sufficient and ages 10+and they are in school while she is at home.  They clean up after themselves but they are kids, our house is generally in order.  I would say better than most with kids and animals.

I am fully capable and do a great job of maintaining the household, she studied abroad for several months and I did everything with a 3, 5, and 7 year old at home.  The house was in better shape when she was gone.

Any suggestions for the resentment?  It's there no matter the season, no matter her employment.  She often says she is jealous of me for my position in life but always cuts me down.",3,1744136920.0,sahm,1,1.0,False

Hello! I‚Äôm in the middle of putting together a coffee table based off a design I saw online. I adjusted the measurements to what I wanted, consulted with a lumber guy at Lowe‚Äôs to ensure the best way to get the look I wanted without cutting essential corners, had the wood cut at Lowe‚Äôs and brought it home to assemble.

Well‚Ä¶. I have most of the base assembled and my biggest frustration is that even though the cuts were good - the wood is uneven. I figured I could sand some of it down after it was all assembled, however seeing it now? Jesus, I‚Äôm not sure how to tackle sanding it. I‚Äôm in NC, and don‚Äôt want to buy more tools being that I‚Äôm trying to be cost effective. I also have six additional cut pieces that are to be glued to the outer side of the leg panels - as if to double it up (if that makes sense). Which I can imagine would add more sanding to do.

Any advice on how to get this done efficiently? Would an orbital sander suffice? Can I rent those? Or if there‚Äôs such a thing as taking it to someone or a business to fix the sanding? I don‚Äôt know if places like that exist‚Ä¶.? I also used my jig saw to cut down one leg side, and had intentions to do the other side - just haven‚Äôt started at as I‚Äôm taking a small break.

My then 4-year-old and 2 year old sons are now 16 and 14 and playing games on their own phones! 

Last month I started playing Bit City, then decided to see whether Tiny Tower was still a thing. It is - with lots of changes!

1jukkfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christian/comments/1jukkfh/baptized_last_year_i_think_i_cant_have_faith/,"Baptized last year, I think I can't have faith because I'm autistic.","
English isn't my first language, sorry for any mistakes.

Hello, I'm Catholic. I was baptized last year after two years of catechism.
I was diagnosed with autism last year, shortly before my baptism. I had great difficulty going out, and I asked to be baptized the following year. I was told it wasn't really done.

My diagnosis followed years of anxiety and depression, only to learn that I actually have sensory issues and that it's normal for me to be tired as soon as I go out.

Living alone from a young age (especially at boarding school), I had a framework and routines that made me function, and the diagnosis took time to be made.

I think I had a bad support.
I simply hated all my church mertings.
I found them boring, uninteresting, and all oral, whereas I need diagrams and written material to understand.

I spent two years in two different parishes, I went to a student chaplaincy, and I even found an online community.
But still, despite various techniques, I can't do it.

I felt like the accompanists didn't understand what we were feeling.
They assumed we were all fulfilled to have found God.

I hated how they spoke to another person with a disability; when she arrived, everyone would say, ""Oh, our ray of sunshine,"" ""But the group is nothing without you""
It's super embarrassing. She didn't have an intellectual disability, she was just in a wheelchair, and everyone made a big deal about it.

My disability makes me unable to connect with people.
I'm very much in love with my boyfriend, but I feel very little emotion for others; I don't feel any social connection. I am not happy to see others, I do not like to spend time with a particular person, I like to talk and exchange but not with a particular person.

Groups are super awkward.
Sometimes people invite each other for coffee and become closer friends, but I can't.
So I never know how to behave, how to speak, what line I'm supposed to have with whom.
Some people try to put themselves forward.
I really can't stand social interactions; it bothers me, and it also makes me anxious because I know I'm doing it wrong.
I have such a huge misunderstanding of social interactions that I'm unable to fit in, and I find these meetings just exhausting.
I just feel like loads of people are talking at the same time and waving their hands around; I can't keep up.

I was supposed to have follow-up with someone in addition to the group, but it was impossible.
I was already tired, and I couldn't connect emotionally with the person.
Everyone thought their support person was great and had coffee with them. I think my support person was a good person but really not suited to me.

Also, I can't sing.
When I have seizures, I become nonverbal.
Speech is quite complicated for autistic people.
Singing is such an intimate thing, it makes me so uncomfortable, I hate it.
So I often find myself doing nothing when people are singing.

I haven't been to church in eight months.
I hate going to church; the noise is unbearable, it's long, and it hurts to get up and sit down.
I can never, ever concentrate on what's being said because of the reasoning.
My processing of noise is different; every sound is at the same pitch, and a background noise completely prevents me from listening to the rest.
Also, I need the sound to be clear and clean, which isn't the case in churches.

I don't feel anything either.
I know my body always makes me feel a lot of strange things because of my disorder, so I don't understand when people say they feel God.

I tried a meeting at the beginning of the year to support newly baptized people, and as usual, it went really badly because it's a group.
They also said they didn't understand why the newly baptized people were leaving, without questioning the support provided.

I also live with my boyfriend, and he can't go to church either.
So, it doesn't motivate me either.

I only feel negative. I feel totally disconnected when people talk about God. And the more I listen to people share their feelings, the more I think I don't believe it. Their stories are so far removed from what I feel.

I wanted to share a quick story about how I stumbled into making my first few bucks as a solo founder‚Äînothing life-changing yet, but enough to keep me hooked on this journey. It‚Äôs been a wild ride, and I figured some of you might relate or pick up a nugget or two from my experience.

A while back, I noticed a gap while working with Supabase (that open-source Firebase alternative everyone‚Äôs been buzzing about). Developers like me were juggling databases, real-time stats, and storage, but there wasn‚Äôt an easy way to keep tabs on everything from a phone. I‚Äôm not a fan of being tethered to my laptop 24/7, so I thought, ‚ÄúWhat if I could build something to fix that?‚Äù That‚Äôs when I started tinkering on a mobile tool to manage Supabase projects on the go‚Äîthink real-time insights, database navigation, and a quick SQL editor, all from your pocket.

The first version was ugly but functional. I shared it with a few developer friends, and they actually used it without me begging them to. That was my ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment‚Äîsolve a real pain point, and people will care. After polishing it up (and learning way more about mobile dev than I ever planned), I threw it out into the wild. No big launch, just a quiet release to see what‚Äôd happen. A handful of developers found it, and soon enough, I saw my first couple of dollars trickle in through a subscription model. It wasn‚Äôt much‚Äîbarely covered a week‚Äôs coffee‚Äîbut man, that feeling of someone paying for something I built? Unreal.

The lesson here? I didn‚Äôt start with a grand business plan or a marketing budget. I just scratched my own itch, validated it with real users, and kept it simple. Turns out, developers are willing to pay for tools that save them time and headaches.

Curious to hear from you all‚Äîwhat was your first ‚ÄúI made money from this‚Äù moment? Any tips for a newbie like me trying to grow something small but steady?

We started dating, but it quickly became apparent that his wardrobe choices could be a challenge in our relationship given that we went on a coffee date, and he wasn't allowed into the caf√©.

Nevertheless, we continued dating and he moved in. After a few weeks, I tried to show him how good he could look in clothes, whilst still trying to capture the essence of his somewhat nudist tendencies. Shirtless at night, unbuttoned at parties and in hot weather, you know the drill. I'd spent hours deciding on the best outfits to embody his personality whilst making him more socially acceptable, but whatever I tried, he refused to wear any of it.

I tried for years to embrace him as he was. We had a baby (currently Child F), he became a stay-at-home Dad and sold his paintings to support one income, but the lack of social interaction outside of the house put a massive strain on our relationship. Not to mention the flirting with my ex boyfriend!!

So, eventually, something had to give and I broke up with him.

He's an amazing Dad to our daughter, but I just can't see a way to ever be truly happy with him romantically. AITA?",9,1744135979.0,AITASims,2,0.92,False
