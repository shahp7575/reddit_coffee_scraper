1o1lvfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobia/comments/1o1lvfg/coffee_kicking_my_ass/,Coffee kicking my ass,"I‚Äôm not using any censors - tldr: coffee hurt stomach and anxious 

This morning around 9 I got some coffee, I typically don‚Äôt do this since caffeine gives me anxiety and also the coffee itself usually hurts my stomach. 

Today was no different.

I went to work, drank my coffee and realized that I didn‚Äôt eat in the proper time frame and that I essentially downed a large iced sugary coffee with no sustenance (except for some spicy ramen the night before üôÇ..) 

An hour in I started getting crampy, i brushed it off as PMS and continued. A half hour went by and I knew if I didn‚Äôt try to let it out one end I would be in an anxious panic state (at this point I wasn‚Äôt nauseous just in pain).

TLDR: blew up the work bathroom twice, did not feel satisfied after. Took a pepto when I got back to my desk, drank some water slowly.

I had a half day so left when the pepto kicked in, ate a sandwich and now 30 minutes later the cramping is back! 

I proceeded to blow up the bathroom at home one last time and took another pepto just to relieve the cramping and tummy ache. 

As I write this I feel slightly better. This was good unintentional exposure therapy. I still feel crummy but I think it‚Äôs just with time it‚Äôll be better

I am trying to get satisfactory running on my Linux mint and have run into a few problems and I was hoping someone here might be able to help! The game keeps freezing at random moments somewhere between starting up or loading into a world. Sometimes it freezes at the first loading screen, sometimes when loading into a world and the furthest I have gotten was a black screen inside the tutorial. In all these cases any audio inside the game will keep playing but the game itself becomes unresponsive and needs to be killed through either steam or the system monitor.

I have tried a number of surface level fixes, from reinstalling to changing the proton version but nothing has really fixed my problem so I was hoping someone here could provide some insight in what might be causing this or how to provide more insight into whats the culprit.

After my shift yesterday on October 8 ended around 1:30 AM, I took my usual ride home which was a UV Express and then a Jeep along Felix Avenue. I was in a good mood because I felt really productive, efficient, and accomplished today, so my guard was let down as I played music through my earphones and scrolled through Steam, adding games to my cart.|  
  
""Bago tayo umabot sa dulo, PAPATAYIN KITA!"" 

I looked up from my phone and saw two men in black hoodies. The one who yelled at the driver was closer to me and was inching forward with his knife out while the other one was blocking the exit while the jeep was barely slowing down. 

The guy with the knife turned to the woman opposite me who was already trying to put her phone and wallet back in her bag to which the guy gestured for her to bring it out (I had already quietly put my earphones in my pockets and my phone in my bag at this point). I was unable to see if the guy in the back had anything on him.

The guy in front of me was moving counterclockwise and he was two people away (assuming he wasn't going to do anything to the driver or the conductor in front) before he got to me. There were maybe 6 to 10 of us in the jeep and I was in the middle, driver's side.

I looked at my stuff and just knew to myself that I was not giving this away. Everything I had with me at the time were gifts (phone & wallet), books I saved up to get, and my company-issued devices (with charging cords and cables). I knew I did not want to give them up.

The jeep stopped at this point in front of PLDT Cainta and while the two hooded men looked towards other passengers and around the area, I was waving my hand outside to the cars frantically. Nobody stopped. 

One thing I did notice was that I was slim enough to fit through the window; no grills, thank God. I slowly lifted my leg up until the man in the back said, ""Kuya, dyan ka lang! Wag kang gumalaw!"". But I saw a brief period of time where no cars were passing by to hit me. 

So, I took my chance.

I put my right hand, carrying my bag out first and lifted my feet enough that my whole body fit through the window and then I ran. I ran and didn't look back. 

From where we were at, I looked for the nearest establishment and saw a gas station. It looked closed but from what I could see, there were two Shell employees near the garage in the back who I ran towards. I started explaining to them, hyperventilating. 

According to bystanders, it was between 1:45 AM and 2:30 AM where they saw me run into the gas station. The jeep I was on (blue lights inside, unfortunately no other discernible traits because I was carelessly on my phone) passed by minutes later and I pointed at it: ""YAN ANG NA HOLDAP, DYAN AKO GALING!"". I withdrew my hand and involuntarily hid whenever another jeep passed.

I was breathing in short spurts uncontrollably and while the employees tried to calm me down, the man in the higher position said he could call someone to radio someone in.

An enforcer from the One Cainta team approached me and assured me that we were safe. He was in a white shirt, slippers, but he had an ID on him. My first instinct was that this guy could have been involved with them so without filtering my thoughts I asked, ""Kasama ka ba sa kanila?!"". He understood how worried I was so he showed me his ID. 

It said ""Republika ng Pilipinas. Bayan ng Cainta."" followed by his name and his position as ""Enforcer"" and an organization name I didn't hear before. Below that, it said ""Office of the Mayor"" over a signature. While I was panting and gasping for air, he said he was calling some people he knew for help, but no one was picking up. 

I remembered that the jeep was only until Tropical/Q-Plaza. They didn't say ""Cubao"" when I boarded it at Junction. While the Shell employees were assuring me that this happens all the time and while the enforcer was contacting his contacts, I called my parents and explained what happened. 

I was initially going to get off at Tropical Hut, so my parents could fetch me but now, they were driving to me as I shared my location.

My right thigh must have hit the bottom of the window hard, or I didn't land correctly; it was bruised. Furthermore, I noticed a sting on my left arm, and it was probably cut from the tip of the metal lining around the window itself. I noticed this earlier when I was hiding in Shell's garage, but I was most worried for my safety and the consequences of my leaving on everyone in the jeep.

My parents fetched me shortly after. they talked a bit with the enforcer while I was washing my wound. Before I left with my parents, we took a picture of the enforcer's ID just to be sure. 

I couldn't control my breathing in the car, and I knew that I couldn't rest if we didn't do something, so we drove around looking for any signs of any distressed jeep drivers or passengers. The closest police outpost we found was the one across Anson's/the ATMs in Q Plaza and there were no lights, and no one was around. However, we did save the phone number on the tarpaulin on top of the entrance.

We stopped by the police outpost in front of 7/11 facing Marcos Highway and across Sta Lucia. Dito yung babaan at sakayan ng mga jeep na papunta SM Masinag sa Tropical. I got out of the car and explained immediately what I just went through in great detail to the one in the middle. The one I was talking to was sipping coffee and was taking my panic in stride, there was another wearing glasses beside him standing up and attentively listening, while the one on the left most side of the table was writing something down. 

They waited until the end of my story before telling me that since the incident happened in Cainta (Jeep stopped in front of PLDT Cainta but the holdapers boarded earlier), I had to go to the Cainta police outpost, which had no lights, and no one was around. 

They clarified that they were Marikina police and they couldn't help us, so we had to go to the outpost that had no people. One of the Marikina policemen mentioned that no jeep driver reported this so far and that they would have noticed it it passed by them. 

I felt so defeated and helpless and as much as I wanted to do more, my cautious parents told me I should be glad I'm safe instead of throwing myself out into danger again. 

Who knows if the this was an inside job? They seemed to pull out the knife right away.

What if the driver was in on it? I never looked at him as soon as those two boarded. 

What if the enforcer allowed them? He was not in uniform. 

What if a corrupt cop in the precinct/municipal hall took note of the personal details in filing a report? I could have already been red tagged by the two crooks, the enforcer, the outpost police, or even the driver.

I hate that we live in a country where we have to even worry about this.

...

I couldn't sleep when I got home out of survivor's guilt, anger over a corrupt system, fear for the safety of everyone else who was on that jeep, and newfound anxiety of riding jeeps.

I thought about the run from the side of the jeep to the gas station and how those could have been my last few moments because who knew if the guy in the back was armed. I remember vividly thinking, in that sprint to the gas station, how I have so much to live for.

I keep replaying about what I could have done better and if we stood a chance if we all ganged up on what seemed to be just two of them, but I know now that more people might have gotten hurt that way. 

I wanted to sleep in comfort knowing that the enforcer or the Marikina police would actually look into it, but this was getting harder to believe. 

I dreamt of being held at knifepoint when I finally did sleep. Only this time, I fought back but ended up with two severed fingers and I woke up panting again, hyperventilating. 

Nobody should ever have to experience that. Nakakinis na palagi nilang sinasabi na mag-ingat sa mandurukot, mga bastos, mga holdaper na para bang tanggap nalang natin.

I've already been homeless a couple times briefly over the last few years, and it's been years since I actually had my own residence.

I worked until 2024, when I could no longer handle my labor intensive job. My employer gave me a scholarship, and I was trying very hard to finish engineering school and get to the less crippling desk work, but I was just so burnt out all the time that I couldn't handle anything except resting for the next shift. What finally did me in is I made a few friends, and started spending my days off doing something other than fatigue-sleep. And then suddenly my body started giving out at work, because I was just pushing it over the line.

When my savings ran out, I had to move in with family. But no one wants me. They all want me to work full time and support myself, but I don't know how to sustain this without finishing school first. I just cannot handle going back to the coffee shop. Some of them are suggesting I should get multiple jobs for some reason. And they all want me gone. My parents have both separately thrown me out, as have all my grandparents. I ask all the time if I'm being a bother and everyone says no -- they just can't stand me taking up the space and eating the food and costing the money. I am about to move to my absolute final option, but she wants me to work two jobs and immediately get back in classes, and I don't think it's going to go well. I'll burn out, and she'll throw me onto the street with whatever savings I have.

And yes I know there's disability. But while I have diagnoses, I have no doctors for supporting my application, no health insurance, and no money. And even if I get on it, they'll ban me from earning, ban me from saving, and it'll pay so little I still can't make rent. I don't actually believe it's possible to survive on disability in America without family support or other charity.

I just want to finish school. I could give so much value to the economy, but it feels like I'm being told by everyone and everything that I'm not worth it and to lie down and die.

But I also know that some people, somehow, manage to live a stable life with their own residence, even while entirely home bound. How?? What secret am I missing??? üò≠",2,1759953581.0,ChronicPain,0,1.0,False

I woke up before my alarm. 6:14 a.m.

For the first time in years, I beat it. The room was still dim, the soft hum of my ceiling fan filling the silence. I lay there for a while, staring at the same water stain on the ceiling I‚Äôd always ignored. It looked different now, the shape had shifted slightly. Less like a blob, more like‚Ä¶ an eye.

I shook the thought away, turning on my side. Get up. It‚Äôs just water damage. Don‚Äôt start your day weird. I showered, dressed, and went to grab my pants, the same pair I‚Äôd worn yesterday. The stitching on the seam was gone. Not torn again, not frayed. Just‚Ä¶ never fixed. The rip was there as if it had never been patched at all.

For a moment, I stood there frozen, my heart beating faster than it should. I blinked, rubbed my eyes, blinked again. Same rip. Same rough edges.

*Maybe I dreamed that it was patched. Yeah, maybe that‚Äôs it.*

Breakfast went the same way. Two slices of toast, coffee black. Except this time, the toast popped up before I‚Äôd even pushed the lever down. I laughed nervously. Malfunction, I thought. Everything breaks down eventually.

I ate quickly, half-convincing myself it was fine. My watch ticked steady this time, no twitching, and for some reason, that made me feel worse. Like it knew I was watching.

When I stepped outside, the street was quieter than usual. No joggers. No cars. The air itself felt still, thick, as if sound had been muffled.

By the time I reached my car, a single vehicle rolled past, a black sedan with tinted windows. It slowed as it passed my driveway, almost stopping. My reflection stared back at me in its windows. Then it sped off without a sound.

I got in my car and turned on the radio. Same Taylor Swift song. Same exact lyric. Same tone.

I laughed this time, a strained little chuckle.¬†*‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta be kidding me.‚Äù*

I switched stations. Static. Switched again. Same song. Switched again. Silence. Then a faint voice:

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late today.‚Äù*

I froze. The voice was low, faint, maybe the radio host, maybe just interference. I turned the knob down. My pulse thundered.¬†*Just*¬†background¬†*chatter,*¬†I told myself.¬†*Coincidence.*

When I got to the caf√©, the same barista smiled at me from behind the counter. Same hair, same tone.

*‚ÄúMorning, sir,‚Äù*¬†Janice said.

Her lips moved exactly the same way as yesterday. Every blink, every tilt of her head was identical. Like a playback.

I stood there, smiling stiffly.¬†*‚ÄúUh, yeah. Morning.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThe usual?‚Äù*¬†she asked.

*‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù*

She reached for a cup, then froze mid-motion. For a full second, she didn‚Äôt move, hand suspended over the cup rack, smile frozen. Then, as if someone had pressed play again, she continued like nothing happened.

My throat went dry.

When she handed me the coffee, her fingers brushed mine, and they were¬†*cold.*¬†Not normal cold, refrigerator cold.

*‚ÄúHave a great day,‚Äù*¬†she said, the same exact tone as yesterday.

I stepped back, heartbeat pounding, the cup trembling slightly in my grip.

Outside, I sat in my car and stared into my coffee. My reflection wavered in the black surface. For half a second, I saw another face behind mine, blurred, unfamiliar.

Then it was gone.

I drove to work, trying not to think. The streets looked the same, but‚Ä¶ off. The same car, the black sedan, passed me three times, always from a different direction. Same license plate. Same slow roll past my car.

When I reached the office, the receptionist greeted me the same way. Same smile, same¬†*‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù*¬†I wanted to say something,¬†*do you remember saying that yesterday? Do you ever say anything else?*¬†\- but I didn‚Äôt.

My cubicle was spotless again. The mug I‚Äôd left half-full was cleaned, replaced in its exact position. My papers were aligned perfectly. Someone had been there, but everything looked untouched.

I sat down, powered on my computer, and opened my inbox. For a long time, I just stared.

No¬†*‚ÄúWAKE UP‚Äù*¬†email this time. Everything normal. Meetings. Memos. Spam.

Then, at the bottom of the screen, just as I was about to minimize the window, a small pop-up appeared:

**DO YOU REMEMBER YET?**

I blinked. It was gone. No window, no alert history, nothing in the taskbar.

My skin crawled.

I stood, walking toward the bathroom. On the way, I passed John from accounting.

*‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù*¬†I said.

He looked up, smiled the same stiff smile as yesterday.¬†*‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHey, John, weird question,‚Äù I said, forcing a laugh. ‚ÄúYou ever feel like‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve done this before?‚Äù*

He blinked.¬†*‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Like the same exact day, same stuff, same conversations.‚Äù*

He tilted his head slightly.¬†*‚ÄúYou should get more sleep,‚Äù he said, still smiling.*

*‚ÄúYeah, probably,‚Äù*¬†I muttered, brushing past him.

When I looked back, he was still standing there, staring after me, not smiling.

In the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face. Looked in the mirror.

My reflection lagged.

Not a trick of the light. Not tired eyes. It¬†*lagged.*¬†A half-second delay before mimicking my movements.

I stumbled back, heart hammering, hands gripping the sink. My reflection smiled, a fraction too wide, before catching up to me.

Then, faintly, I heard it again. The radio voice, whispering from somewhere beyond the tiles:

**Wake up**

I slammed the faucet off. Silence.

When I returned to my cubicle, my coffee was gone. My desk was perfectly clean again. And on my monitor, a single open email waited for me, no sender, no subject, no body. Just one line of text in the preview pane:

The red is seating (a sectional and two chairs that can swivel to look out the bay window), purple is a coffee table, and orange is the TV

Option 1: Corner TV at an angle on an angled tv stand

* **Pros/cons:**¬†Most optimized furniture layout, but requires the couch to be flush against a wall (and I am a big couch floater

Option 2: TV flush against wall next to fireplace

I don't plan to book everything ahead since I'll be renting a car and I want to be free to move around but I still highlighted a few regions I want to see.

For now I've included Santander and Boyaca for the small villages and beautiful mountain roads, Huila for the archeological sites and the desert, coffee region (maybe) and I might join a friend for a few days in Medellin. 

I know about the main attractions of these regions, I've done a lot of research and I'll be spending some time to just wander around, get lost and see what happens (I've already done it in multiple countries and this is the best way to get stories to tell your kids) 

I DON'T like : party life, clubbing, big tourist traps, sex tourism

I like : hiking, history, museums, small villages and I'm a photographer so I'm always looking for unique places to photograph

 - I'm looking for 1 or 2 more regions to add to my trip, preferably safe enough to drive through (I really wanted to see La Guajira but read only bad things about solo travelling without guides)

- should I skip coffee region and the caribbean coast ? I think I'll be disappointed if I go since they look a bit like tourist traps

- are tataoca desert and san augustin alone worth the detour to Huila region ? other recommendations in Huila?

- I'm still doing research for some beautiful hikes, I'm not much into guide hiring / group tours I'd prefer to be on my own (no ciudad perdida) but I'm open to anything else, jungle, mountains, beach, deserts

I'm starting a new channel focused on simplifying money habits, and I just made a quick video on a trick that's been HUGE for my budgeting.
It's called The $5 Rule, and it attacks the root cause of budget failure: instant gratification.
The core concept is this: Before you buy any non-essential item under $5 (like a coffee, snack, or small online item), you ask yourself: 'Is this tiny purchase worth delaying my biggest financial goal?'
It forces your brain to create 'psychological distance' between the impulse and your aspiration (e.g., that big trip, paying off debt).
I animated a quick 50-second guide that explains exactly how and when to use it, plus what to do with the money you save immediately.

The problem is, I don‚Äôt know how to take a break from her without hurting her feelings.

1o1l3qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pgmp/comments/1o1l3qw/obtained_pgmp_in_2nd_attempt_oct25/,Obtained PgMP in 2nd attempt - Oct-25,"[Advertise on Reddit](https://ads.reddit.com/register?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=nav_cta)

Hi guys,

I made a Reddit account just to share my experience. It is correct that there isn't much literature available on PgMP and anything that could help others must be appreciated. I will be concise.

**Experience**

I just finished four years as Program Manager. Prior to this, I have three years as Project Manager. I have a PMP I obtained in 2020.

**Application**

The application process was fairly straight-forward. I didn't wait - PgMP has been on my radar for over a year and I had been impatient for the day I qualify for the application. I had no idea about the resources: I filled in the form and gave quite vague answers to the personal experience questions. I was not aware the same is used by the panel to review applications. My thoughts were that this was the first PMI check, and a panel discussion would appear later. As expected, the panel objected and I reach out to a PgMP certified friend to understand the process. I then formatted the same experience and response to questions in a more *PMI-compliant* vocabulary to get it sorted. Apparently, we need to add more of *I did this* not *We did this* although I feel I am incomplete without my fantastic team.

**Preparation**

There was an opportunity for a Sr. Program Manager in my organization that I was looking forward to. I wanted to get the PgMP credential to align myself for it as soon as I could. I scheduled my exam within a month of this. My initial preparation material was the PMI book and course videos of IBM on Coursera. I passed the full-length mock exam in the first go with 84% score. I felt confident.

10 days before the exam I realized I should probably invest in more mocks. No brainer, except you cannot find much. This forum landed me on iZenbridge's youtube channel: the videos looked reasonable, so I went to their platform. Apparently there isn't an option to purchase full-length mock exams - I ended up with the full training + mock exams. I went through the training videos once and practiced *some* exams. Scored less than 80% but I didn't think much of it.

**Exam 1**

The exam was NOT easy. The grammar is AWFUL. I don't care who writes the questions, I wonder who APPROVES them. Honestly, they could do better English. Anyway, I continued with the exam and finished in 2.5 hours. I had flagged about 35 questions, reviewed at the end, but did NOT feel confident while submitting. I knew if I had passed, it would be with only the tiniest margins. I didn't, and I felt I didn't deserve to.

**My scores:**

Strategic Program Management: Below Target  
Program Lifecycle: Target  
Benefits Management: Target  
Stakeholder Management: Below Target  
Governance: Needs Improvement

I went through the PMI score report and compared the detailed analysis with the ECO. The result was obvious: I was overconfident with the Governance domain as this is something I perform in my job role the most. I did not study from the PMI standards and got all except 2 wrong. It was a good self reflection. I immediately booked my next exam, only available after a month, and made a retake preparation plan.

**Retake Preparation**

I knew where I went wrong. I focused most on Governance, followed by Strategic Alignment, and them some with the other domains. I went through the ECO and the PMI PgMP resource book. I also focused on iZenbridge's training videos in these domains. Then, I went through the short practice exams, improved my scores (96% in Governance) and learnt the root cause for the questions I got wrong. I took only one full-length mock again.

**Exam 2**

Unlike the last time, this exam went easy. It was confidence. However, the three key differences in approach relative to previous exam:

\- No last-minute prep. It only confuses me in my opinion. The exam is about understanding the principles.  
\- Hydration and energy: I was practically parched and hence drowsy in the previous exam! I ensured to get more than a good night's sleep and a lot of hydration. It helped me focus.  
\- Breaks: The exam does not have prescribed break time. It doesn't mean you cannot take any. I took a 2-minute toilet break at 100-question mark and then took another one after finishing all 170 questions.

Overall, the exam went really well from the start. I was able to get all questions done in two hours or so. I had flagged a little over 60 questions. Rest were all obvious and didn't warrant more than 45 seconds. I had way more flags at the end I reckon. Barely 5 questions were repeat from the previous exam - I expected more. Key qualifiers are certainly important; the body brief of the question would paint a picture however the question could ask you something that's independent to throw you off. For example, it can narrate a story about a program risk management plan and then ask you how do you make a stakeholder register. This is an example only, of course. What to do first, next, best - these are important.

My game changer was this: a brief 10-minute break at 170-completed questions. I left the examination area and went for a stretch. Sat at the bench and was lucky to find coffee there. Took some sips nice and easy, refreshed and energized myself, then went back to review my flagged submissions. I ended up changing between 25-30 of the 60 flags. Why? Because the refreshed mind and the experience from other questions made it easier to focus on the obvious. Staying at something you are stuck for 2 minutes wouldn't help you: come back again with a fresh perspective.

The result was all Targets. A little sad as I hoped for at least two Above Targets. But at the end of the day, a valid PgMP is a PgMP.

Appreciation to iZenbridge guy no doubt. I will be recommending him to my colleagues. Have any questions? Shoot and I will try to answer.

Cheers.

Just over 3600 miles of driving and three of the most stunning scenic byways in the country. 

Day 1 from Albuquerque to Long Beach. This was the longest stretch and also the most boring. I‚Äôve done this route several times so easy as far as that‚Äôs concerned but obviously an all day affair. Stopped in Flagstaff to walk the dogs and get lunch. Stayed at an Airbnb this night. It was solid for a one night stay. 

Day 2 from Long Beach to Cambria. Slow going through the metro area and up to Malibu. We were ready for a break in Malibu despite not having made it very far mileage wise. Traffic heavy and right through the burn scar so not the most beautiful part of the coast currently. The further north you go the more scenic it is of course. Cambria is a sleepy little tourist town and your dinner options after 8 will be extremely limited! We ended up eating a gas station dinner this night because we relaxed too long once we checked into our room. Highly recommend the Sea Otter Inn if you are traveling with pets like we were. Super romantic, bottles of wine available in the office and the picnic basket breakfast was a lovely touch. 

Day 3 from Cambria up to the closure on the 1, doubled back up the 101 to Carmel-by-the-Sea. This was a fun day. Took a hike up into a redwood grove off of the 1 south of Big Sur. One of the only places where you can hike with your dog amongst redwoods that I was able to find. Doubled back down the 1 and took the 101 up to the Monterey Peninsula before settling into our accommodations in Carmel-by-the-Sea. Caught a beautiful sunset on the (dog friendly) beach before getting dinner and a few supplies from neighboring Seaside and called it a night. 

Day 4 From Carmel-by-the-Sea down the 1 to Big Sur and back. On day 4 we explored Big Sur which was jaw dropping beautiful. I‚Äôve seen people asking if it‚Äôs worth the time to drive down even though you have to drive right back up. The answer is yes. Totally worth it. Missed the bookstore in Big Sur because it closed before we made it back up so don‚Äôt make this same mistake and stop right away. Walked the dogs at George Washington Park after getting back to town. Ordered take out and ate dinner in our room before walking around in the evening to see some of the cottages. Quite a lovely town at night. Very safe. Nothing but positive things to say about the Monte Verde Inn where we stayed both nights. A small breakfast with fresh OJ was delivered to our room both mornings. They even left a complimentary decanter of sherry in the room! 

Day 5 from Carmel-by-the-Sea to Fort Bragg. Tried to get an early start on this day as we had a lot we wanted to see in Carmel before heading out. Checked out the last of the cottages before hitting the 17 mile drive on the way out. Spent too much time admiring the Golden Gate Bridge. Lost a lot of time in SF between being a tourist and traffic. Made it over the bridge and at this point decided to take the 101 to make it to our next destination. Caught a sunset at Muir Overlook before getting back on the road north. The 28 from Willits to Fort Bragg was terrifying at night lol. Driving through a redwood forest with deer popping out on the side of the road like a video game was a white knuckle experience. Thankfully our room at the Beach House Inn had an en suite jacuzzi that was perfect for unwinding and relaxing after that drive. Their sister property up the street also had a fenced in dog park that was perfect for us. 

Day 6 from Fort Bragg up to the Avenue of the Giants and back to SF. Woke up and explored Fort Bragg. Weather was excellent and the views over Glass Beach were awesome. The further north you go the more intense the waves are it seems. After leaving town we made it up to the Avenue of the Giants which was surreal. The old growth redwoods make normal trees look like toothpicks. Truly insane. Did a drive thru tree on the way up and overall might have been my favorite day of the trip. Drove back down the 101. Ate dinner at In-n-Out in Santa Rosa where we were able to score a parking spot right by the patio so we were able to eat comfortably while our dogs were in the car 10 feet away. After several meals in the car and on the nightstand eating dinner at a table felt luxurious. Made it back to SF for the night at about 10:30. Stayed at the Kimpton Alton in Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf. We paid for the valet package so that we had peace of mind parking overnight. 

Day 7 from SF through Lake Tahoe to Salt Lake City.
Woke up and noticed we had a view of Alcatraz from our room which was cool. Got lattes and pastries from the restaurant in the lobby and while delicious they were the most expensive coffee and pastries I‚Äôve ever had in my life lol between automatic gratuity and a couple of different taxes I was ready to gtfo of SF. Took a detour to Lake Tahoe to walk the dogs along the lake. Got back on the road and all I have to say is the 80 mph speed limit on I80 through Nevada is awesome. Stopped in Elko for dinner and to walk the dogs. Made it to Salt Lake City at 1:30 in the morning because we didn‚Äôt account for the time change. Stayed at a Holiday Inn Express. Nothing special. 

Day 8 from Salt Lake City to Delta, Colorado. We took a detour through Midway to see the architecture in that town and also some of the fall colors along the way. The drive was rainy and gloomy which made the fall colors pop even more. Our original goal was to make it to Silverton by sundown and after a stop in Fruita to gas up and walk the dogs (awesome dog park in Fruita) it was apparent we weren‚Äôt gonna make it before the sun set. We found a little dog friendly inn/RV park along the way in a town called Delta. The room was the cheapest and also one of the nicest we stayed in on our trip. Room had a small patio and the property was on the river which made for a great nights rest on the last night of our trip. Nothing but glowing praise for the Riverwood Resort.

Day 9 from Delta through the Million Dollar Highway back to Albuquerque. Woke up early to walk the dogs along the river and see the sunrise on the water. Spotted a beaver in the river and saw his dam a bit further up the trail. Went to the most awesome dog park I‚Äôve ever seen in Montrose. Caught a bit of rain as we made it into Ouray. Thankfully the rain slowed to a drizzle and we were able to enjoy the views safely. Stopped in Durango for dinner before getting back on 550 to make it to Albuquerque. 

Overall it was a bucket list trip and probably the most fun I‚Äôve had in a trip in my whole life. Truly the adventure of a lifetime as far as road trips are concerned. I don‚Äôt think I would ever stack so many days/miles together again but I‚Äôm glad we did it and was much less fatigued from the road when it was all said and done than I anticipated. Total cost was roughly a dollar a mile (not including souvenirs). I will include charts breaking down drive time and fuel costs in the comments. ",5,1759952726.0,roadtrip,3,1.0,False

I bought that cream colored couch and brown coffee table back in July and I think it fits well on that side of the sunroom.

You can probably just ignore the egg chair and everything else in the room. I might move the egg chair to another room depending on how it fits with the rest of the sunroom when it's fully furnished.

Now my idea is to get another couch for the area next to the window (see #1). This would be parallel to the existing couch. I don't think I'll need another table and probably an ottoman suffices.

What do you guys think?

The long sofa arrangement is too long for my space but it can be turned into a left/right arm facing sofa which will make it fit pretty well. I would probably go with the left arm facing arrangement which means the arm will be next to the brick wall.

The color is light gray so doesn't perfectly match the cream color couch, but I think it's still fine? It doesn't necessarily need to be the same color.",1,1759952663.0,HomeDecorating,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 1:**

**Evan Bongiovanni**

**I think I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today. Either that or it's the phone call I just received at 3 in the morning that's got me in a bad mood. Apparently there's something going on down at the station and Logan needs me. I make my coffee as I receive yet another phone call from my bone headed partner. ‚ÄúLogan, I already told you I'll be there soon,‚Äù I sip my coffee as I grab my hat from the coat rack.**¬†¬†

**‚ÄúListen Evan, you don't understand, I'm outside your door right now. We've gotta go!‚Äù**

**The phone hangs up as I see his cruiser out from my door. It's raining and thundering outside, this puts me in a bad mood. I open the passenger door and cram myself inside, before Logan steps on the gas.**¬†

**‚ÄúJesus man, you got a hot date?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúNo man christ, there was a murder!‚Äù**¬†

**I adjust my cap, ""There's always a murder,‚Äù I light a cigarette as my partner runs a red light.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna get us killed,‚Äù I look at Logan who seems to be in a trance.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah but this one‚Ä¶this one's really bad, the chief called in everybody for this!‚Äù**¬†

**We stop in the middle of the projects, the usual spot when I notice the door on the building.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhats with the door?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúSomeone must have broken it down,‚Äù Logan gets outta the car as I place my hand on the door handle.**¬†

**‚ÄúWheres everyone else?‚Äù I ask**

**‚ÄúLooks like we're the first ones here-‚Äù Logan is interrupted as a girl screams and comes running out of the building.**¬†

**‚ÄúWoah woah hey, what's going on?‚Äù Logan consoles her as she slows her breath.**¬†

**I take out my gun and approach the door as Logan keeps talking to the girl.**¬†

**I look into the house‚Ä¶broken glass everywhere, tons of blood. What the fuck happened here. I turn into the kitchen to my left. More blood, seems almost like a trail. Can't be good. I follow the trail over to a door with the crack open. Fucking god damn it. I keep my gun and my flashlight steady as I open the door.**¬†



**Chapter 2:**

**Raymond Carver**



**‚ÄúCarver!‚Äù**

**‚ÄúCarver!‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúOver Here!‚Äù**

**Reporters scream as security disbands the crowds. So many people, and the lights are blinding. Jesus, it feels like everyone's just screaming at me. Oliver Jelly, my bodyguard lets me into my limo as he wraps around the other side.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think you were the president of the United States the way these people treat yah‚Äù Oliver buckles his seatbelt as our driver starts to take off. I like Oliver, he's real, like a real person. When I talk to people‚Ä¶I have a hard time telling if they're actually present with me. But Oliver, Oliver is present.**¬†

**‚ÄúCan I get you a Pepsi boss?‚Äù**¬†

**I love Pepsi. I nod to Oliver as he reaches into the cooler and pours me my drink.**¬†

**‚ÄúUpdate me,‚Äù I take the drink from his hand as I close the driver's window.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell sir, not much to update on right now. Nothing else I could get on the guy. Although it looks like they put Bruno and Bongiovanni on the case. I know that doesn't help, but I'm just saying,‚Äù Oliver pours himself some whiskey.**¬†

**My father was crucified last night. Not sure how I feel about it yet. Apparently he was with one of his girlfriends when it happened. I got some of his inheritance money, and mothers upset. Other than that I can't really think of anything else on the matter. Although there is this one issue that pertains with my fathers murder. The Anti-Christ did it. To prove a point. Go ahead don't believe me, but it was in the police reports. Some crazed lunatic calling himself the Anti-Christ killed my father. Unlucky I suppose.**¬†

**‚ÄúAnything on the Anti-Christ?‚Äù I turn to Oliver.**

**‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶they haven't found him yet. But they're looking,‚Äù Oliver takes another sip of his whiskey before the limo comes to a halt. Oliver then steps out of the car and opens my door.**¬†

**‚ÄúWelcome home boss,‚Äù Oliver grabs my suitcase from the limo as he walks up the stairs to my fathers mansion. I was recently on a trip to Switzerland. I like it there.**¬†

**The maids open the gigantic doors for us as I examine the first chamber. Not exactly how I remember. Red, but not organic.**¬†

**‚ÄúSeems dead,‚Äù I mutter as I walk underneath my fathers chandelier.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell your father hasn't had many people around for quite a while,‚Äù a familiar voice rings my ears.**¬†

**‚ÄúMargret, it's nice to see you again. I can't remember the last time we've seen each other.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúOh my it must have been about five years now,‚Äù she says as she stares longingly at the ground. She's my fathers maid, an older woman in her sixties. She practically raised me. Her face stings to look at, especially since I haven't exactly been sending anyone postcards from Switzerland.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell it is nice to see you Margret, I'll be moving my things in shortly. I will be staying until mother arrives in ten months, then I'm headed back to Switzerland.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúDo send post cards after you leave Raymond. Would you like me to make you dinner? I have lasagna waiting in the oven!‚Äù**

**Lasagna is my favorite.**¬†

**‚ÄúThat would be pleasurable Margret, I will be in fathers cave.‚Äù**¬†

**I waive her away as I make my way to fathers library. Oliver's already there, it's like he could sense it.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou ready sir?‚Äù Oliver asks**¬†

**‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù**¬†



**Chapter 3:**

**Logan Bruno**

**‚ÄúYou fucking mother fuckers. I cant believe you two mother fucking fuckers,‚Äù Chief says as he stares directly into my eyes.**¬†

**‚ÄúWe really had no idea how high profile the case was going to be, if we-‚Äù Evan starts to reply as the chief interrupts him.**¬†

**‚ÄúShut up, just shut the fuck up,‚Äù Chief puts his thumb in his mouth and sucks on it. Every so often he finds it comforting. Evan thinks it's pretty weird but I've tried it and I've gotta tell you it's not as bad as it seems. It almost makes you feel like a little kid, you know? Anyways, Chief keeps yelling at us while I just tune him out and look at the half eaten donut on his desk. Is that Jelly? It certainly would explain the red stain on the chief's shirt. I wonder if he would mind if I could have some.**¬†

**‚ÄúCan I have the rest of that,‚Äù I pointed towards the donut, ‚ÄúIt's jelly right?‚Äù**

**The chief glares at me. I can tell he is disappointed. He continues yelling and yelling until eventually he calms down.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright listen, I've got you guys on a security detail. Prove yourself and you'll be back on my good side,‚Äù Chief hands Evan a file as he gestures to the door. I try one last time to take the donut but he eats it in front of me. That bastard. Anyways, Evan leads me into the car and lights a cigarette as I start the engine.**¬†

**‚ÄúSo this guy we're supposed to protect? He's some senator or something?‚Äù I say as I plug the address into my phone and turn on the music.**¬†

**‚ÄúShut the damn music off Logan. No this guy isn't a senator, it's the governor, Corbin Hayes. Apparently he's making a speech about the death of the billionaire, Todd Carver,‚Äù Evan bites his nails as he looks down at the file.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah man what even happened back there? I heard that the guy was crucified or something,‚Äù I turn the music up a little as we drive, ‚ÄúYou know that girl that came out crying was only thirteen? Why is everybody so upset about this guy dying?‚Äù I say because Evan doesn't seem like he wants to respond.**¬†

**‚ÄúBecause he's rich, and other rich people care about other rich people. He's also the reason this city fucking stinks,‚Äù Evan hits a drag of his cig as he blows the smoke in my face.**¬†

**I hate it when he does that. Anyway, we pull up to the venue and flash our badges to a security looking dude and walk our way in.**¬†

**‚ÄúHEY ISN'T IT THE SECURITY DETAIL AY?‚Äù**¬†

**Evan and I look behind us as we see a blonde man in a suit.**

**I lean towards Evan, ‚ÄúWhy is this man yelling at us?‚Äù**¬†

**The man rapidly shakes my hand and then takes Evans and does the same. I can tell Evan didn't like that cause I didn't like it either.**¬†

**‚ÄúHello Governor, it is nice to meet you. Im Evan Bongiovanni and this is my partner-‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah yeah yeah hey listen guys, just really quick. Honestly you're really only here to represent the police department. So we just need one of you guys to come up with a little something to say about the investigation and then you'll be done alright. SUPER SIMPLE!‚Äù**¬†

**I look at Evan worryingly.**

**‚ÄúYeah but we aren't prepared for a speech. Neither of us were informed of this happening,‚Äù Evan takes a step back as the man takes a step forward.**¬†

**‚ÄúJust make something up! It's quite literally that easy. Oh and by the way we're on in five.‚Äù**¬†



**Chapter 4:**

**Evan Bongiovanni**

**‚ÄúHELLO EVERYONE! HOW ARE WE DOING!‚Äù Governor Hayes yells as the crowd stays silent.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell everyone we have quite the amount of news to share today. Obviously everyone wants to hear about Mr. Carver and the police investigation. But of course I would like to remind everyone of the new grand opening of the Liberty Correctional Institute for Super Powered Individuals! That's right! A new containment facility made specifically to target super powered individuals. No more unstoppable rampages by super powered individuals, and most importantly a huge win for our very own public police department!‚Äù Governor Hayes starts to clap and so does the crowd as everyone seems to be looking in my direction.**¬†

**‚ÄúHey man good luck out there, I'm glad it's you and not me man,‚Äù Logan pats me on the back as I walk on stage.**¬†

**‚ÄúHey be cool alright?‚Äù The Governor also pats my back as I stand up towards the mic.**¬†

**‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶hello everyone my name is uh Evan. Um, Todd‚Ä¶Carver was uh, fine gentleman, he uh-‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúIs it true that he was crucified!‚Äù A reporter screams at me from the audience. The rest of the crowd also mumbles.**¬†

**‚ÄúUm yes uh he‚Ä¶‚Äù I look towards Logan who seems to not be paying any attention, ‚Äúyes he was crucified.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWas he with an underage girl!‚Äù A reporter yells as the crowd erupts.**¬†

**‚ÄúThat I'm not 100% sure on, we're still looking into the uh‚Ä¶‚Äù I start to sweat as fog starts to pour into the city square.**¬†

**‚Äústill looking in? still looking in for what?‚Äù A metallic raspy voice looms over the square.**¬†

**‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù I murmured to myself as I ran off stage towards Logan.**¬†

**‚ÄúBEHOLD, I AM THE ANTI CHRIST!‚Äù**¬†

**On one of the big TVs I can make out a faint metallic looking figure on the screen.**

**‚ÄúTHIS TODD CARVER IS NOT WHO YOU THOUGHT HE WAS! THIS MAN WAS NOT A SAINT, IN FACT HE WAS A FRAUD!‚Äù**¬†

**Multiple photos of Todd Carver appear on the screen, some photos with questionable things in them. Very questionable. Some even include the Governor.**¬†

**‚ÄúYOU PEOPLE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS CITY! I WILL REVEAL EVERYTHING TO YOU! ONCE I AM DONE THE CITY WILL BE CLEANSED!**¬†

**The metallic man then disappears in a flash of light as the Governor is rushed into his protection vehicle.**¬†¬†

**‚ÄúI guess we should just run back to the car?‚Äù Logan gestures to the cruiser.**

**‚ÄúGood idea.‚Äù**



**Chapter 5:**

**Raymond Carver**

**‚ÄúSir, you're gonna wanna see this,‚Äù Oliver turns on one of the big tv monitors.**¬†

**I put on my cowl and walk over to him.**¬†

**‚ÄúThe Anti-Christ, what did he do?‚Äù I stumble back and trip over my cape.**¬†

**‚ÄúI refuse to believe this, your father was a good man Raymond. The Anti-Christ is a murderer. Who knows what his motives are,‚Äù Oliver tries to console me but I push him away.**¬†

**‚ÄúThose pictures‚Ä¶‚Äù I look down at the ground through the holes in my cowl.**¬†

**All of a sudden I feel a shake on my body. I feel a burning sensation in my chest before I leap into my Porsche. I press a button, sort of like your average garage door opener, and Todd‚Äôs cave opens. You'd be surprised what billionaires do with their money. I race down the streets of the city, cruising in my car as rain splinters down onto the windshield. My radar starts to pick up something, a robbery. I rushed over to the bank.**¬†



**Chapter 6:**

**Logan Bruno**

**God damn it. The police station is going haywire because of this Anti-Christ Guy. Evan‚Äôs getting the day off cause apparently he's traumatized, and now I gotta deal with this bank robbery. Great. I hop in my cruiser and rush to the scene. Surprisingly no other police cars have arrived yet so I take a hidden stance behind my vehicle. Lights are flashing in the bank and I can't see much of what's going on.**¬†

**‚ÄúThis is Logan to the station,‚Äù I say on my radio, ‚Äú are there hostages inside of the bank?‚Äù**

**No response. Dammit. I grab my gun and approach the bank door. Smoke spurs out of the doorway as I get closer. I keep my flashlight in my pocket to avoid attention and quickly sneak inside. Bullets start to fly in multiple directions as I hear screams and grunts in the smoke. Holy crap, I am totally fucked. I see a man with a vest come my way and I immediately threaten to shoot him before he responds by immediately trying to shoot me. Thankfully some man in a black suit took the bullet for me so I had enough time to shoot the robber. Holy crap, I think to myself again. I go over to the man on the ground in the suit.**¬†

**‚ÄúWho the fuck are you bro?‚Äù**¬†

**The man spits up blood on the floor.**¬†

**‚ÄúOh Jesus, some civilian trying to play superhero, some luck I get.‚Äù**¬†

**By now I notice that the bank is burning down and I should probably get outta here.**

**‚ÄúAlright dude, you‚Äôre coming with me!‚Äù I try to pick him up but realize he's too heavy.**¬†

**‚ÄúAw shit man, I'm so sorry,‚Äù I start to tear up as he points to the robber. He's still alive.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright I'm on board with this,‚Äù I say as I leap towards the robber and pick him up on my shoulders. You know, it's surprisingly easy to carry someone when they're not wearing a full leather suit. I run with this guy on my shoulders and literally as I'm running the bank collapses behind me. Anyway, I made it out and by now there are tons of firetrucks and ambulances there so they end up taking me to check for injuries.**¬†

**Chapter 7:**

**Evan Bongiovanni**

**Don't get me wrong, I know the stations busy with the whole Anti-Christ thing, but everybody's gotta take a break every once and a while. I mean I've got a family you know. I'm with them right now, having dinner. My beautiful wife, who I'm pretty sure is cheating on me, smiles at me from across the table. Her face makes me wanna throw up in my mouth. My two depressed daughters look at me and ask me what I did today.**¬†

**‚ÄúI almost died, some guy tried to shoot me.‚Äù**¬†

**My wife gives me a disgusting look.**¬†

**‚ÄúBut it was actually a robot supervillain guy so it was really cool!‚Äù**

**My children laugh as my wife orders them to bed.**¬†

**‚ÄúGoodnight guys!‚Äù I say as they run upstairs.**¬†

**‚ÄúGoodnight Papa!‚Äù the two of them shout back.**¬†

**Now it's just me and my wife at the table.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cheating on me aren't you?‚Äù I ask.**

**‚ÄúYes, I am.‚Äù**¬†

**She glares at me. That stupid sly face of hers.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I ask as I pick up a piece of bread from dinner.**¬†

**‚ÄúBecause I don't love you anymore,‚Äù She starts to cry as she runs upstairs.**¬†

**Well that was fucking soul crushing. I know I said all that stuff before, but I mean, I didn't think it was THAT bad. Anyway, I grab my hat and I light up a cigarette outside as a man approaches me in the dark.**¬†

**‚ÄúCan I help you? I'm eating bread and smoking a cig.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúYes, I believe you can. My name is Ethan Aresanult, I have some information I think can be useful in solving one of your cases,‚Äù The man steps back, ‚ÄúYou are Evan Bongiovanni right?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúYes, yes I am.‚Äù**¬†



¬†**Chapter 8:**

**Raymond Carver**

**I'm a failure. At least I feel like one, sitting under all of this rock. Somehow still alive. That was stupid. If only that cop wasn't there I would have had it under control. Although that fire was getting pretty big, I'm sure the rain would've stopped it. Actually it did stop it‚Ä¶eventually. Now here I am, impaled by a metal rod in my side and sitting under a boulder. I need a better suit. You would think Oliver would have upgraded my suit from leather to metal while I was gone but for some reason he didn't and now I'm probably gonna bleed out here. Unless Oliver‚Äôs here to save me. Oh yeah Oliver is actually here to save me.**¬†

**‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù I hear him yell as some men come over and push the rock off of me.**¬†

**My security detail, good thing it's still night time. I don't need people knowing I lost my first fight. Oliver comes over to me with some paramedics.**¬†

**‚ÄúOliver!‚Äù I cough up blood, ‚ÄúPull this thing outta me.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúIm not so sure if that's a good idea boss,‚Äù Oliver looks directly at me.**¬†

**‚ÄúJUST FUCKING DO IT!‚Äù I scream as Oliver grabs my body and pulls me out from the metal rod.**

**Oliver places me on a gurney as I look up at the sky, it's very clear tonight. I obviously pass out and wake up in my cave. Oliver and Margret next to my bedside.**¬†

**‚ÄúIm so glad you're awake!‚Äù Margaret tries to hug me as I achingly do my best to give her a hug.**¬†

**I feel something different about my body, something is off.**¬†

**‚ÄúOliver, why don't I feel like I was impaled by a metal rod and crushed with boulders? What kind of drugs did my doctors put me on?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù Oliver pauses, ‚Äúin order to save your life, they needed to give you cybernetic enhancements. Nanobites in your bloodstream. Your whole left side is part metal.‚Äù**

**I look down at my side. Half of my stomach is metal, great. Oliver also goes on to explain that some things I do are enhanced now. Like running, punching, things like that. Margaret tells me that I look extra handsome today. Honestly I think she's been trying to sleep with me since I was a little kid. But I try to ignore it. Oliver follows me into the gym where I hit the punching bag. I get a few light taps in before I hit it hard. It flies across the room. Oliver's jaw drops. Quite frankly mine does too. Does this mean I have a moral responsibility to help people because I'm ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù now or am I just rich?**



¬†**Chapter 9**

**Logan Bruno**

**Well that was certainly eventful, I mean that guy with that suit in there was pretty wild. I'm obviously super glad he took the bullet for me, but Jesus, what a way to go out. I mean crushed by a building and all of that. I hope they find his body. When I ask about the suited man in leather to the nurse she just stares at me and runs away. Something about me with women. Anyway, I eventually am discharged and get to go home to my apartment. But something's off, my whole floor smells like gasoline. What the fuck man? I open my door and there's this guy with a mask pouring gasoline all over my apartment.**¬†

**‚ÄúDude im gonna beat the fuck outta you bro,‚Äù I say as I bum rush him into the wall. He punches me in the face and then once in the stomach and I'm on the ground. I've never been the most athletic guy and plus my body still hurts from last night. I roll over and squeeze my stomach as the man starts pouring gasoline all over my body. Oh fuck dude, Im gonna die in this apartment right now. The man covers himself in gasoline and brings out a match box. Suddenly a burst of water pushes him out of the window. I see Evan and a man with curly hair rush in.**¬†

**‚ÄúLogan, are you alright man, look, we gotta talk to you. Come with us,‚Äù Evan gestures to the door as the other guy looks outta the window, ‚ÄúYeah he's dead as shit. For sure. I think he was just a normal dude.‚Äù**¬†

**Evan walks me into his cruiser and the curly haired man sits in the backseat.**

**‚ÄúEvan, what the fuck is going on!?‚Äù I scream in the car as he drives.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell essentially the guy in the back, his name is Ethan. He says he is a superhero for hire and he's got some kind of team of superheroes or something,‚Äù Evan looks at Ethan in the mirror. I also turn around to look at him.**¬†

**‚ÄúSo he's got water powers?‚Äù I ask.**

**‚ÄúYeah I've got water powers, and I'm damn good at using them too. You know most people with super powers just wanna rob banks and allat. But me and my boys we‚Äôre good people, trust me.‚Äù**¬†

**Well, the guy seems nice, he's got water powers and he's cool with Evan. Good enough for me.**

**‚ÄúWhat's up man! I'm Logan, Evans' partner. Where are we headed Evan?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúOh, we're just gonna pick up my boys right here,‚Äù Ethan points towards a house where four men are standing outside.**¬†

**‚ÄúThis is your super team?‚Äù I ask as I point to the guys outside.**¬†

**‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Ethan responds as Evan gets out of the car and opens his door.**¬†

**Ethan greets them all with hugs and Evan gives them all handshakes.**¬†

**I go up to the first one and reach out my hand.**¬†

**‚ÄúMy name is Logan, I'm a police officer and I'm Evans' partner. Thanks for helping the cops out! What's your power?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúMy names Kyle and I stretch, wanna see?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúSure!‚Äù I say as he proceeds to stretch his hand out to give me the finger and calls me a dirty narc.**¬†

**‚ÄúThanks man,‚Äù I go over to the next guy, who is absolutely insanely huge, and looks like he's made out of a grey rock, ‚ÄúWhats up, Im Logan,‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúGideon, my name is Gideon.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWell alright! Nice to meet you Gideon,‚Äù I walk over to the next one, equally as disappointing as the others.**¬†

**‚ÄúSo what's your power?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúIm fast nigga,‚Äù the man spits on his hand, ‚Äúnames Johnny‚Äù**

**‚ÄúOh well alright!‚Äù**

¬†**Chapter 10**

**Evan Bongiovanni**

**I can't believe I've got all of these guys in my car. The stretchy ones in my trunk. This is the stupidest idea ever. I have no leads on the Anti-Christ and the chief is gonna hate this idea. I get to the station as I see a lot of cars parked outside, which is very unusual. Everyone starts to get out of the car and we walk up to the police doors. I open the door and news reporters have flooded the main lobby. I take everyone behind the side door and into the main hallway. Chief's office is down on the left so I tell everyone to hang tight and for Logan to keep an eye on them before I walk into Chief's office. I open the door and the Chief is talking to Governor Hayes, who is half leaning on his desk. The chief would never let anyone do that.**¬†

**‚ÄúHey! Evan right?! My guy, what's up!‚Äù**

**The Governor hugs me as he kicks the chief out of his chair and the chief sits next to me. It's weird, I have never seen the chief conform to someone like this before.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright guys listen, I'm gonna be honest. This whole Anti-Christ situation, it's got people pretty riled up. People wanna know that someone is defending them from this guy. And listen guys if I'm being totally honest I really need this new superhero prison opening to go well and this isn't gonna look good if we can't catch this guy‚Ä¶‚Äù The Governor claps his hands, ‚Äúso does anybody have any ideas?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúIve got a pretty good idea.‚Äù**¬†



**Chapter 11**

**Raymond Carver**

**I'm out on the street, lurking. Looking for potential criminals, crimes, anything to get my mind off of everything. What I'm really doing is looking for the Anti-Christ. If I could just see a symbol, anything. I would do terrible things to get my hands on that guy. I see a car roll past, with a capitol A crossed out in red, painted on the back. It's time. I leap down from on top of the building and onto the car. I rip open the roof and the goons in the car immediately start trying to shoot me. However, I learned from last time and my suit is fully kevlar. I absorb the bullets and start fighting the four goons in the car. Everytime I punch one I feel another punching me harder. I can't give up. I pound one goon's head over and over again into the wall until being smacked in the face by a baseball bat. Where the fuck did that come from. Three of the goons start to beat me until I get a hold of a metal pipe on the truck. I yank it off and beat the socks off of the goons. The truck is still moving but suddenly comes to a stop. I'm not in good shape, and my nose is pouring blood.**¬†

**‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù I mumor as the doors to the truck open.**¬†¬†

**Twenty more goons surround the vehicle with guns as I look out of the truck. The Anti-Christ‚Äôs mechanical body moves into my view.**¬†

**‚ÄúHello. What interest do you have with my ship hero?‚Äù his raspy voice hums through the air.**¬†

**‚ÄúAre you a human, or are you a robot?‚Äù I say as I move my way towards the back end of the truck.**¬†

**‚ÄúIt doesn't matter‚Ä¶the city needs to be cleansed. You know it just as well as I do. You fight crime don't you?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah, but not like you,‚Äù I kick up one of the goons ak-47s and start spraying at the Anti-Christ. He swoops in and pushes me back against the truck. Absorbing all of the bullets.**¬†

**‚ÄúThis is you‚Äôre only warning Raymond, stay out of this.‚Äù**¬†

**He knows my name. How does he know my name? He flies me into the air rapidly before throwing me into the river.**¬†



**Chapter 12**

**The Group**

**‚ÄúOk so no deal,‚Äù Evan says as the group sighs.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell why not,‚Äù the rock man shakes his head, ‚Äúwho do I gotta kill to get this job.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWell actually that's the problem,‚Äù Evan says, ‚Äúfirst of all you can't kill people, second of all you guys are asking for too much money.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúIts only 200 thousand dollars nigga,‚Äù Johnny says.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah well it's too much money, they can't afford it,‚Äù Evan shakes his head.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhos saying all of this?‚Äù Kyle says as he stretches his fingers into a ball.**¬†

**‚ÄúThe Governor‚Ä¶of the city‚Ä¶‚Äù Evan stares at the group.**

**‚ÄúLet me talk to this Governor man, and teach him a lesson,‚Äù the rock man starts to get up but Ethan settles him down.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright Gideon it's all good. Me and the Governor talked it out, we're gonna get Anti-Christ and he's gonna get us a federal contract. We‚Äôll be like the Wonder league! ‚Äù Ethan claps his hands as he sits down, ‚ÄúSo in other words, we got the gig!‚Äù**¬†

**The group stares at each other.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright team, let's get it together and figure out a plan to get this guy. To the B4URAGE CAVE!‚Äù**¬†

**The group gets up and runs out of the police station.**¬†

**‚ÄúHey Evan, anyway I can stay at your place? My apartment is covered in gasoline and the windows broken,‚Äù Logan asks as Evan gets off the phone.**¬†

**Uh you know what, Logan, usually I would say yeah but the wife's just been driving me nuts lately. Sorry man,‚Äù Evan tips his hat and leaves the station.**¬†

**‚ÄúOh okay.‚Äù**¬†



**Chapter 13**

**Logan Bruno**

**I'm outside by myself and it's dark. I don't have anywhere to go, but I really like this one beach. So I think I'll go there. I wait for the bus for about 15 minutes but then I give up and just start walking. Eventually I find the beach and just lay down. What am I gonna do about my apartment? Shit. I look to my left and I see a man in a suit covered in blood. At least I'm not that guy. Wait a minute. Is that the same guy? From the bank? I walk over to the man and look at his face. Definitely the same guy.**¬†

**‚ÄúLeave me alone,‚Äù The voice whispers as I drop his body.**¬†

**‚ÄúHoly shit man I thought you were dead! Who are you?‚Äù**¬†

**The man struggles to sit up.**¬†

**‚ÄúMy name's Ray, you're the cop from the bank yeah? Any updates on the Anti-Christ case?‚Äù Ray spits up some blood after he's done asking.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah I am, actually the station just hired some superheroes to go after the Anti-Christ. Supposedly they're getting a federal contract!‚Äù**

**‚ÄúOh good, that's great. Cause, I'm not cut out for this,‚Äù Ray got up on the beach.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhy man what are you saying? You saved me at the bank, remember?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah I know‚Ä¶‚Äù**

**He looks at me and nods as he drags himself into the brush. Not sure how to feel about that guy, but he seems pretty cool. Love the suit.**¬†



**Chapter 14**

**Raymond Carver**

**Fuck I failed again, twice now Ive gotten my ass kicked. This superhero thing is harder than it looks.**¬†

**‚ÄúBoss, you're gonna die if you keep doing this,‚Äù Oliver passes the joint as I sit with him on Todd‚Äôs lawn.**¬†

**‚ÄúOliver, I'm not so sure,‚Äù I have my hand stuck in a cast now, been like that for a couple days. Apparently Anti-Christ and his goons have gone quiet. But there's a new patrol of heroes now. They call themselves ‚ÄúThe Supes!‚Äù very original. There's one big one, Gideon‚Ä¶hes the muscle, he's got stone for a body and he smashes stuff. Then there's the speedster, Johnny‚Ä¶hes quick, obviously, but judging by the footage ive seen of his work its sloppy. Next there's Kyle who seems to have the ability to stretch into almost anything. Then there's their leader, Ethan, who seems to squirt water? Maybe he's the brains. Anyway it's good to see that someone is here successfully protecting the city.**¬†

**‚ÄúBoss you alright?‚Äù Oliver touches my shoulder and I stop zoning out.**

**‚ÄúSorry, I got lost in the za, I say as I take another hit.‚Äù**¬†

**I look towards the mansion and see Margret coming down the lawn.**¬†

**‚ÄúMr. Carver, sir, the police are here, they're asking for you,‚Äù she sighs as she looks at the ground.**¬†

**Oh thank god, I thought it was the Anti-Christs goons.**¬†

**‚ÄúThank you Marge, much appreciated,‚Äù I signal to Oliver and we make our way back to the mansion. I have Oliver open the front door for me only to see practically the whole police force at my door.**¬†

**‚ÄúAre you Mr. Carver?‚Äù one of the policemen walked up to me.**¬†

**‚ÄúYes I am,‚Äù I respond**

**‚ÄúYoure under arrest, on suspicion of being the terrorist known as the Anti-Christ.‚Äù**¬†



**Chapter 15**

**Evan Bongiovanni**

**The Anti-Christ. Wow. I can't believe we got him. I was there, you know, when the sly son of a bitch walked out of his mansion. His bodyguard looked malicious, police even had to restrain the guy. Almost got sent to the station with his master. Anyway, I hop in my cruiser and follow the chief and the others to the station. If only Logan was here to see this. For some reason he was late to work today. What an imbecile, imagine missing the catch of the biggest supervillain ever seen in the city. We pull up to the station, and there he is, the Anti-Christ, In his pajamas walking into the station. It'll be a while before the other cops get him booked, but I can already hear the celebration from inside the station. I open the door to champagne and donuts. Perfect.**

**‚ÄúHey man!‚Äù Logan slides next to me and walks me over to our office, ""what's going on out there?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWell actually you just missed the biggest catch of the century. Not sure how they got it together this fast. Apparently I heard that some blood was found at the murder of Todd Carver that matched Raymond Carver. Speaking of which, can you believe that! A son crucifying his own father, freaking messed up man,‚Äù I make my way to the coffee machine and start to make some.**¬†

**‚ÄúEh, not too surprising. Rich people do crazy stuff all of the time,‚Äù Logan shrugs as he kicks back on his desk and takes a bite of cake.**¬†

**I gotta get myself some of that.**¬†

**‚ÄúHEY EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY!‚Äù The Chief yells from inside the main station.**¬†

**I signal to Logan and we walk for the door. Chiefs standing with the man of the hour. The Anti-Christ.**¬†

**‚ÄúWE GOT EM! THE SON OF A BITCH WE GOT EM!‚Äù**¬†

**Everyone cheers as I start to clap. I look at Logan and he seems to be blankly staring at Chief. Weird.**¬†

**Chapter 16**

**Logan Bruno**

**I pull Evan back into our office.**¬†

**‚ÄúOh man dude‚Ä¶oh man‚Ä¶‚Äù I lean against my desk.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhat, what's wrong?‚Äù Evan sits in his chair.**¬†

**‚ÄúThey got the wrong guy man. That's not the Anti-Christ dude, that's the guy who saved me at the bank robbery,‚Äù I sigh, ‚Äúhow are we gonna tell Chief man?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWhat do you mean they got the wrong guy? His evidence was at the scene of the crime. That's pretty incriminating. Plus you said the guy who saved you died at the bank, and I was there, we couldn't even find his body,‚Äù Evan says as he stands up.**¬†

**‚ÄúNo seriously man, I saw him at the beach the other day super beaten up. Remember, after I asked you if I could stay at your house? And you said no? Yeah so after that I went to my favorite beach and the guy who saved me at the bank was there. The SAME GUY in the station right now! Don't believe me? Dude, the guy literally has a cast on. How could he be the fucking Anti-Christ with a cast on?‚Äù I yell as I get out of my chair.**¬†

**‚ÄúWho knows, the Anti-Christ could've gotten hurt when he flew out of the Governor's speech or something. Listen, everybody's really happy about this, don't ruin it for everyone else,‚Äù Evan gets up to the door to leave, ‚Äúbesides, even if you were right, no one would believe you. What proof do you have?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúWoah hey hold on man so are you saying you don't believe me? Like I'm just making up this superhero dude or something?‚Äù I plead just as he opens the door.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah man, I don't really believe you. But it doesn't matter,‚Äù Evan shuts the door as I shake my head and sit in my seat. Aw man, what the fuck am I gonna do?**¬†



**Chapter 17**

**Raymond Carver**

**Oh boy. This is gonna be rough. I'm in half a room full of lawyers defending me from crucifying my own father, with the other half trying to prove that I did, in fact, crucify my own father. To be honest, the ladder has got a pretty good case here. My father and I didn't get along very well, which is why I moved to Switzerland. Kind of estranged if you will. Then there's obviously the money side of things. He left me in charge of the business, so that alone makes me a billionaire. All of these things would make sense. Except for the fact that of course I didn't CRUCIFY my own father. The process would take days, who has time for that anyway. If I was gonna kill someone it would be in a much more effective manner. Like with a knife or a shotgun. Anyway, the lawyers keep bickering and I've quite enough of the chatter. Besides, this is ridiculous, there's no need to-**

**‚ÄúThen why have we found his blood at the scene of the crime?‚Äù one of the lawyers smirks and sits back.**¬†

**My lawyers talk to each other and bicker for a moment.**¬†

**‚ÄúIm sorry, how could my blood have been there if I wasn't there?‚Äù I ask as my lawyer grabs my arm.**¬†

**‚ÄúI don't know, you tell me,‚Äù the lawyer gives me the smuggest look I've ever seen as my lawyers keep frantically trying to defend me. It's clear to me that I've been set up, probably by the Anti-Christ, or someone else who hates my family. Either way it's not looking very good for me at the moment.**

**Chapter 18**¬†

**Logan Bruno**

**Oh man, this is not good. That is not the Anti-Christ. We actively have a superhero in custody right now. And most worryingly, Evan seems to be against me on this. I mean technically he's right, who would believe me? But still, I just can't believe it. I gotta get out of the station. So I'm walking down the road, on the way to my favorite coffee shop, when I catch the eyes of the prettiest woman I've ever seen. Woah, I wish I had the guts to talk to her. Oh well. I walk into the coffee shop and sit at the bar. ‚ÄúIll have the usual,‚Äù (Tucker knows I like it with tons of sugar) I say as I wave to Tucker behind the bar.**¬†

**‚ÄúHello!‚Äù**

**I turn around, its the woman from the street.**¬†

**‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶hello, how can I help you?‚Äù I move back in my seat.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell I just saw you on the street and wanted to ask you out for some coffee! And, well, here we are!‚Äù The woman sits next to me. She waves to Tucker. ‚ÄúIll have my coffee black please!‚Äù She turns to me, ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre a cop?‚Äù**¬†

**I look at my badge on my uniform. Oh yeah, forgot I was wearing that.**¬†

**‚ÄúOh yes mam, I am actually a detective,‚Äù I say as I grab my coffee from Tucker.**

**‚ÄúI dated a cop once, it didn't work out,‚Äù the girl looks down and sighs.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhy didn't it work out?‚Äù I ask.**¬†

**‚ÄúHe died a couple of years ago,‚Äù she tears up a little bit.**¬†

**‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù I sip my coffee. This woman is beautiful but why is she talking to me?**¬†

**‚ÄúShiela,‚Äù she says as she gets her coffee, ""that's my name. I wanted to know if you wanted to go to dinner sometime? Like an official date?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúSure, that would be amazing,‚Äù I look up at her and write my phone number on a napkin.**¬†

**‚ÄúHere. Listen, I gotta go, it's really busy at the station,‚Äù I get up to leave.**¬†

**‚ÄúOh yeah, I heard you caught the Anti-Christ! That's amazing!‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶right,‚Äù I look at her as I open the door and walk out.**¬†

**Chapter 19**¬†

**Evan Bongiovanni**

**That sly bastard thinks he can get away with murder. The murder of his own father in fact. Despicable, people like this I just can't stand. Rich assholes who think because they can afford twenty lawyers and drive fancy cars that they can get away with anything. Well not this, honestly, this whole Anti-Christ shit is borderline terrorism. But Logan has a point, and not because this guy could actually be a super hero, but why would he kill his own father and then try to expose him. It doesn't make any sense. Honestly, I gotta do some more research into this guy. Could be beneficial. Regardless, I'm watching his lawyers defend him, as the Chief comes up to me.**¬†

**‚ÄúListen the Governors got some news for us, he's requested our presence tonight for dinner,‚Äù Chief leans back, ‚Äúnot sure what it's for but he's worried about something.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúHe wants you and‚Ä¶me?‚Äù I stand back.**

**‚ÄúYeah, he said he likes you. But only us, at Groodville Bar tonight, eight o‚Äôclock.‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright sure, sounds good,‚Äù Chief leaves the room and I'm back to staring at Carver, what a jackass.**¬†

Here are a few pics (apologies in advance for the mess):

I bought that cream colored couch and brown coffee table back in July and I think it fits well on that side of the sunroom.

You can probably just ignore the egg chair and everything else in the room. I might move the egg chair to another room depending on how it fits with the rest of the sunroom when it's fully furnished.

Now my idea is to get another couch for the area next to the window (see #1). This would be parallel to the existing couch. I don't think I'll need another table and probably an ottoman suffices.

What do you guys think?

I'm looking into this couch from Costco. [https://www.costco.com/allysn-fabric-modular-sectional.product.100806021.html](https://www.costco.com/allysn-fabric-modular-sectional.product.100806021.html)

The long sofa arrangement is too long for my space but it can be turned into a left/right arm facing sofa which will make it fit pretty well. I would probably go with the left arm facing arrangement which means the arm will be next to the brick wall.

The color is light gray so doesn't perfectly match the cream color couch, but I think it's still fine? It doesn't necessarily need to be the same color.",1,1759952618.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

1o1kxbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HCFanClub/comments/1o1kxbu/humsafars_ep_15_the_arrogance_the_ache_and_the/,"Humsafars | Ep 1‚Äì5 : The arrogance, the ache, and the art of saying everything without a word","Watching *Humsafars* always hits different. The show starts slow, but it builds a rhythm that only someone patient enough to listen can catch. These first five episodes aren‚Äôt about romance or redemption yet. They‚Äôre about pride, pain, and two people walking toward each other without even realising it.

And at the centre of it all is Sahir Azeem Chaudhary ‚Äî played by Harshad Chopda with a restraint that feels almost surgical. Every expression is earned, every pause calculated, every silence heavy. He‚Äôs not performing, he‚Äôs constructing a man piece by piece ‚Äî calm on the surface, chaos underneath.


**My 2 cents so far**

**Ep 1**
The opening is pure contrast. Arzoo‚Äôs messy hopefulness versus Sahir‚Äôs absolute control. He walks in like someone who measures oxygen before breathing it, and yet you can tell he hasn‚Äôt known peace in a long time. The factory demolition scene isn‚Äôt dramatic ‚Äî it‚Äôs deliberate. One man‚Äôs decision destroys another‚Äôs dream, and he barely blinks. When he lifts Arzoo after the near-accident, there‚Äôs no softness, just instinct. It‚Äôs almost uncomfortable to watch, which is exactly what makes it so good.

**Ep 2**
The rain, the stalled car, the near-collision ‚Äî it‚Äôs like fate‚Äôs first little push. He hates the rain, she loves it. He snaps, she shrugs. Tiny details, but they already show who these two are. Arzoo is all heart, Sahir is all control, and Harshad makes that difference magnetic. There‚Äôs nothing romantic yet, just quiet foreshadowing. You start realising that every time he‚Äôs irritated, it‚Äôs less about her and more about losing control.

**Ep 3**
This one flips the energy completely. The fashion show, the recognition, the silent admiration ‚Äî all while his decisions burn her world down. That moonlit coffee scene is so beautifully symbolic: two people divided by a wall, connected by silence. He doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs her, but you can sense something shifting already. The fire sequence though‚Ä¶ Harshad‚Äôs blank stillness in that moment is haunting. No shouting, no guilt, just calm destruction. You don‚Äôt hate him ‚Äî you just want to know what broke him this bad.

**Ep 4**
The aftermath hurts more than the act. Arzoo‚Äôs excitement turns into ashes, and Sahir just keeps observing from the shadows. The lunch scene says everything about his duality ‚Äî polite, unreadable, and yet clearly listening to every word thrown his way. When Daadi curses the man who burned their factory, the camera catches his face for a second too long. No reaction, just a flicker. That‚Äôs Harshad‚Äôs strength: he makes silence look alive. And that farewell before Arzoo leaves for Mumbai? It‚Äôs bittersweet, even for him, though he‚Äôd never admit it.

**Ep 5**
Finally, some humour, chaos, and a dose of tension. The airport confusion, the scissors, the ‚Äúblast‚Äù misunderstanding ‚Äî it‚Äôs classic early-2000s drama but with better chemistry. The plane sequence is gold. Arzoo‚Äôs stubbornness meeting Sahir‚Äôs irritation is pure watchable tension. And when turbulence hits and she grabs his hand, that one blink of surprise from him is everything. It‚Äôs not love yet, not even affection, just awareness. The kind that stays.



**About Sahir (and Harshad being Harshad)**

Harshad doesn‚Äôt act Sahir, he inhabits him. Every tiny movement feels deliberate ‚Äî a tilt of the head, a micro pause before a line, a look that lands half a second too late. He doesn‚Äôt raise his voice, he lowers it till it hurts. That‚Äôs the difference between a loud character and a layered one.

Sahir isn‚Äôt meant to be loved right now, but you already care. He‚Äôs rigid, sharp, even ruthless, yet something about his quiet feels fragile. That‚Äôs Harshad‚Äôs gift ‚Äî he makes pain look dignified.



**What stood out**

The tone. The silences. The way the show trusts its actors to carry emotion without spelling it out. The camera doesn‚Äôt just show Sahir; it *listens* to him breathe. You can already tell this isn‚Äôt a sugar-coated love story. It‚Äôs going to be a slow collision between ego and empathy, pride and vulnerability.

If *Bepannah* was about grief learning to love again, *Humsafars* is about pride learning how to feel at all.

**Discussion points (keep it within Ep 1‚Äì5)**

* Which early scene screamed ‚Äúthis is *the* Harshad Chopda performance‚Äù?
* Do you think Sahir‚Äôs calm is strength or survival?
* Was Arzoo‚Äôs first impression of him fair, or just what he wanted her to see?
* The factory fire ‚Äî business decision, or something deeper he‚Äôs projecting?
* That flight scene ‚Äî comedy, tension, or the start of recognition?
* Did you notice any moment where he softens, even for a second?
* What‚Äôs your favourite Harshad detail so far ‚Äî the stillness, the eyes, or that half-smile that never reaches them?
* For rewatchers ‚Äî now that you know his arc, do these early cracks hit harder?


Every rewatch reminds me that Sahir wasn‚Äôt written to win hearts ‚Äî Harshad made him do that.

P.S. No one should be allowed to look that good while being emotionally unavailable and setting literal factories on fire.

P.S.S. The Urdu, the shirts, the full grown beard, the restraint ‚Äî he didn‚Äôt just play Sahir Azeem Chaudhary, he defined what quiet intensity means.

I'm going live next week. 20 employees with varying degrees of tech knowledge. I have tons of tech knowledge and I can over think things trying to understand the logic behind every action. This is a blessing and a curse for so many reasons. I won't go into them here. 

Today was amazing! Fieldpulse launched Clearpath which I've been calling clearview for some reason. Today was a good day. I'm definately feeling the pressure of not being ready and my wife has demanded we go on vacation days before launch that I'm not ready for. I can't wait to relax and think about all the things I have to do. Yay me! 

That said, I love my famliy and my daughter is 16 and I won't get many more of these before she digs out. 

Ok, sorry! I'm getting to the point. As mentioned the onboarding team has loud background noises and its super frustrating to try to ask questions and get answers with tons of noise. Its literally sounds like a party is going on in the background. Noor once I told her on a call recently its driving me crazy jumped in a room. If this is an issue for you, apparently there is a room so maybe try to schedule your calls when that room isn't busy and you can request a quiet background. 

Why today was sooooo amazing! Carson joined in on some meetings recently and has been amazing. I believe he was brought in for the Quickbooks sync which is both ways. Thats happening now (so nervous). Its working and we will figure it out if it doesn't go as planned. 

Carson has gone so far above and beyond he saw my panic and knew some of my questions would be better suited for a trainer. This is where God in a female version came down and cleared 50% of my confusion and lack of understanding. It was only 50% because I didn't have enough time to asked more. Her name is Ashli and well, maybe she's not God but at that moment she was what I prayed for. I'll call her an angel. She walked me through the Clearpath or view....whatever and talked about use cases based on my real live scenarios. OMG! Cleared up so many things. She gets it! 

I would have paid a large sum of money to have her by my side the past month or two knowing what I know now. In all fairness, this clearpath thing just rolled out and I'm not sure why other field management software systems don't have these custom workflows and action items. Its brilliant. You can tell whoever is the acitect of the software understands things much better than those at Servicetitan. The foundation of any software is navigation and fundationality. I used to pick the shiney object but being in business and understanding how 1% makes such a big difference, I'm going to choose function over pretty. 

Navigating the portal is a lot of clicks for an admin BUT a small sacrifice. I think restructuring it would be ideal and more sexy. 

I digress. Sorry....I had too much coffee today. 

I'm on the grind and going to work every second I get the chance to so this deployment is successful. Successful in my eyes is a smooth-ish roll out. I don't want my team getting so frustrated because I didn't think of everything. 

That said, I'm optimistic I can get it done and work fast not wondering around like a blind man in a dark cave. Wait, he doesn't have to be blind if its dark. To make my point, I'll keep him blind. 

I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Now its back to the old start up days of coffee, sodas, energy drinks, and snacks to power through. 

I'll get back to my work out routine after deployment, I promise. ",2,1759952458.0,fieldservicesoftwares,0,1.0,False

\**Beep of an intercom\**

S: Yes, Carol?

\**Muffled speaking from intercom*\*

S: Oh, he‚Äôs here already?

\**Muffled response*\*

S: No, no, that‚Äôs fine. You don‚Äôt need to tell him to wait, send him in.

S: *\*Quietly, under her breath\** I‚Äôve waited long enough for him already.

\**sound of door opening and then closing*\*

S: Hi there, please, take a seat.

\**Sound of listener sitting down*\*

S: You probably already know this, because I own the company *\*dry chuckle\**, but I‚Äôm Alexa Avery(*or whatever name you want to use)*. And well, I already know who you are, I‚Äôve got your file right here. *\*Sound of papers being tapped against the desk\*.* But it is nice to meet you.

L: ...

S: Well, I‚Äôm glad that the feeling is mutual. Now, do you have any idea why I, the CEO of a multibillion dollar company, has called a middle of the pack employee from our design and development division to my office?

L: ...

S: No, it has nothing to do with your work on Project O.R. or any issues with it. Though, I do appreciate that you brought all your files on it just in case. In fact, in looking over your file in preparation for this meeting, I was surprised to learn that we actually have you to thank for the project being three weeks ahead of schedule. You‚Äôve pulled a lot of late night shifts to keep up that pace, sweetheart, and I can respect and appreciate that kind of work ethic.

L: ...

S: \**small laugh*\* You're welcome, then. Although I don‚Äôt expect thanks for praise of honest hard work. Now, as I said, this isn‚Äôt about Project O.R., do you have any other idea as to why I might have called you here today?

L: ...

S: \**deep sigh, mildly exasperated*\* Yes, yes I know you don‚Äôt have any disciplinary actions or any official write ups. And no, no one has reported you for any kind of dispute. Certainly not anything that's important enough to have you talking to me about it, at any rate. Think back, honey, to about six months ago, when my company had just purchased the company you worked for at the time. Do you remember signing a new contract of employment after the merger?

L: ...

S: Ok, good. Did you actually *read* that contract, or did you just sign on the dotted line?

L: ...

S: You actually read it? Color me impressed, sweetheart. Nobody seems to actually look at their employment contracts with any kind of care nowadays. Tell me, when you looked at it, was there anything that stood out to you? Something that stuck in your mind as odd or important?

L: ‚Ä¶

S: \**gentle chuckle*\* Yes, I suppose the pay increase and stock options for all employees *would* be the thing that stuck out the most in your mind at the time. I can‚Äôt exactly blame you for focusing the most on that. I can imagine that was something of a big deal for you and your coworkers. What I was actually getting at was the Nutrition and Dietary clauses in the contract, and the new programs that came with them.¬†

L: ‚Ä¶

S: Yes, those clauses *are* the reasons that you and your fellow employees have had to have a full physical and blood sample taken by the registered nurse every couple months to check your health and nutrition levels. We‚Äôve been running your blood sugar, level of vitamins, and comparing your weight now to your baseline weight from the beginning of the quarter and to a theoretical healthy weight determined by your doctor, among other things.

S: Those clauses were put in place alongside a series of programs that provide food and nutritional health education to all employees. You‚Äôve probably seen the free lunches in all our building‚Äôs cafeterias, and the takeaway meals we offer during the evenings, but the programs go far beyond that. We also have a program that sends groceries home with employees that are carefully formulated to provide the correct amount of calories, starches, fiber, and protein. And it‚Äôs not just enough groceries for just the employee either, the programs provide food for any dependents they might have, as well.¬†

L:...

S: It is a good system, yes. And we‚Äôve actually seen an incredible increase in employee efficiency and retention. If I‚Äôm honest, I was completely prepared to have the programs be a net loss and just take the tax benefits, but with how much we‚Äôve increased our efficiency and speed over the last quarter, we‚Äôre actually seeing a massive benefit in profits from it. But like I said, that wasn‚Äôt the goal or concern at the time.

S: Now, that‚Äôs the different programs and what they‚Äôre doing. That‚Äôs just a result of the clauses in that contract you signed, not what the clauses actually *do*. I‚Äôm going to assume you don‚Äôt actually remember what those clauses said, sweetheart?

L:...

S: No, I didn‚Äôt think that you did. See, those clauses set a new requirement for all our employees that they must meet. When you signed that contract, you agreed to keep your body in a safe, healthy state. Specifically, the clause you and I care about today, is the one that says you need to be hitting specific bench marks for nutrition and calorie consumption. To put that in layman's terms, sweetheart, when you signed that contract you made a binding legal promise to eat enough food and get enough nutrients to not starve yourself or cause yourself to be malnourished. Easy, right? Especially with the raises we gave you and all the programs we‚Äôve set up to make sure all of our employees are fed.¬†

S: But apparently, for one specific employee, and for *only* one employee, that little clause has been seemingly impossible. Which, really, is too bad for him, because that clause has a *lot* of penalties for failing to take basic care of yourself.

L:...

S: Oh yes, many, *many* penalties, sweetheart. Increased required checkups, loss of stock options, being dropped to the lowest tier healthcare plan, reduction of weekly work hours, loss of vacation days, and even substantial pay cuts, all until your condition improves. And those are just the start for you if your condition doesn‚Äôt improve. If it goes on long enough, you can even be fired for it. And I do mean *you*, sweetheart. You‚Äôve been failing to hit your dietary and nutritional benchmarks for *months*. You were given multiple official warnings to fix the problem before disciplinary action became necessary, and you seemingly ignored every single one.¬†

S: I don‚Äôt even need your files here to tell me that you're starving yourself, honey! Your cheeks are sunken in, and I can count your ribs through your button up and under shirt! I honestly have no idea how someone in your state is working as many hours as you are, let alone actually staying productive. But I bet you aren‚Äôt going to be able to keep it up much longer. So, I want you to tell me why on earth, with all the programs we have for you, on top of the very generous raises we‚Äôve been giving you, how you‚Äôre still managing to kill yourself?

L:....

S: I‚Äôm sorry? What was that? Don‚Äôt mumble to the woman who controls whether or not your entire department stays employed, honey. Speak up.

L:....

S: Uh uh. Louder.

L:...

S: \**Sound of hands slamming on desk*\* I said **louder**!

L:...

S: Pfft! Really? That‚Äôs your excuse? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a v-v-vampire, m-ma‚Äôam‚Äù(*the letters with - are meant to be stuttering, in case that isn‚Äôt clear*)! You think I didn‚Äôt already know that? You think every blood test and health exam we did didn‚Äôt take into account your very serious and life affecting health condition? You think our contracts, written by lawyers that charge thousands of dollars an hour, didn‚Äôt take into account potential vampire employees when they drafted these contracts?

S: Gah! And you said it like it should explain everything, like just because you drink blood instead of eating food that somehow you're exempt from our very, *very* simple ‚Äúplease do not starve yourself‚Äù policy. It does not. There are specialty resources set aside for people with your condition, which I *know* you would‚Äôve been informed of. We might not be able to directly supply you with fresh deliveries of human blood, or keep it on tap in the cafeteria, but there absolutely is a program to match you with an able and willing coworker to be your Source. Who, by the way, should be more than capable of providing enough blood to keep you healthy and well fed. But, for some reason, you have completely neglected to even attempt to sign up for-

L*(interrupting Speaker)*:...

S: \**Voice cold and serious*\* Stop. Stop right now.¬†

\**Deep, calming breath, voice only marginally lessens in intensity*\*¬†

S: First off, don‚Äôt you *dare* interrupt me again if you want any chance of keeping your job or *ever* getting any kind of work in this industry again. Understood?

L: \**Silent, no response*\*

S: I said: is that *understood*?

L:...

S: Good. Secondly, while I appreciate your attempt to explain to me how Vampirism works and the long-term effects it has on someone you regularly drink from, your Source, I don‚Äôt need it. I already know. In fact, I have done extensive research into the effects of long-term feeding and in general the finer details of your condition in preparation for this meeting.

S: I already know, for instance, that real Vampires are not magical parasites like all those old, frankly offensive, myths imply. I know it is a rare contagious condition that causes a form of albinism that takes after how albinism works in plants instead of in mammals. That Vampires cannot produce their own nutrients, and require another human to provide that nutrients to them through their blood. And I know that like albino plants, Vampires are not parasites, but symbiotes.

S: \**lean in and whisper in listeners ear\** And I know that long term feeding from a single human, from your Source, greatly increases their physical and mental health. That repeated exposure to the chemicals your fangs excrete causes you to rapidly regenerate lost blood, and gives a near supernatural increase in strength, speed, healing, specifically a rapid replacement of lost blood, and durability. That being a Vampire‚Äôs Source makes it possible for that Vampire to survive by feeding on only you, and can almost make you‚Ä¶.*Superhuman.*

S: *\*Pulling back and talking normally\** Now, knowing this, I can understand how you might not enjoy the idea of feeding on a coworker who volunteered to be a Source, because of how transactional that seems. How it might feel like you're being used by that person for all these benefits, and that no matter what you want, you have to keep providing those to them or you‚Äôll starve. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to be beholden to anyone in that way either. And I can understand how your pride and morals might chafe at ever feeding from anyone who just wants to use you and your condition for their own gain, but the correct response to those feelings isn‚Äôt to *starve yourself in protest!*

S: No amount of pride or comfort is worth your life and health. *Nothing* is. Especially when there are other options‚Ä¶ Or at least, there are for most people. Most people have family and friends that aren‚Äôt other Vampires who would be willing to let you feed on them, at least temporarily. Or maybe, if they‚Äôre really lucky, they have a partner or spouse who would be happy to help.

S: \**whisper in ear again, this time soft and gentle\** But you aren‚Äôt like most people, are you sweetie? Your parents tossed you to the wolves the moment you contracted your condition, and the few friends you had shunned you nearly as quickly. Even your girlfriend dropped you like you were on fire. And the few friends you‚Äôve made since then are all other Vampires. You‚Äôve no one who is able or willing to help you, do you sweetheart?

L:...

S: \**Pulling back and talking normally, chuckling as you do so\** How do I know all of that about you? Sweetie, I‚Äôm a billionaire who founded her own tech company and built it from the ground up. I can find out anything I want too about anyone, using either my money, or my information gathering businesses via every gadget and gizmo we produce. Legal or illegal, I *always* learn what I want to know. And I have enough money and power that no one is ever going to cause me any trouble over it.

S: Now, let me get to the point of all of this, why I bothered to bring you all the way up here to begin with. You‚Äôve got two choices you can make today sweetie. First option: you can continue the way you‚Äôve been going. Keep starving yourself and slowly dying as you suffer pay cut after pay cut until you lose¬† the only thing you have in your life that's stayed consistent after your infection, the job that we both know you love. In which case I can only imagine you‚Äôll eventually end up either going feral from lack of blood and get arrested trying to feed illegally in a raw, survival fueled panic, or you‚Äôll starve to death. Not ideal on either front.



S: Or you take option two: You make me your Source and feed from me and only me from now on. If you choose this option, you will immediately be promoted to my personal research team, with a pay raise, a new vacation day package, and all the other relevant benefits of the position. Which gives me a competent subordinate who I know is willing to work long hours and has a decently sharp mind, and keeps you closer to your food supply so you don‚Äôt run the risk of ending up back where you are now.¬†



S: And before you immediately start throwing a fit about how you don‚Äôt want me using you for all the benefits your bite can offer, use your head and actually think about it. I have enough money to hire hundreds, no, more like thousands, of Vampires who don‚Äôt have your moral compunctions to feed on me so that I could gain the physical benefits. I don‚Äôt need to go through all this trouble to coerce and cajole you into feeding on me just to attain a superhuman body. So, you can feed on me guilt free, and stop killing yourself over your principles. Those are your options, you are going to pick one right now, and that will be that.

L:...

S: Oh? What if you don‚Äôt? Then I‚Äôll fire you right now instead of in a few months, sweetheart. I won't enjoy it, but I will. It‚Äôs at will employment, honey, I can fire you for just about anything if I feel like it.

L:...

S: Oh? You want me to answer a question before you pick? \**chuckle gently*\* Ok, I‚Äôll bite. Go ahead and ask, sweetie.

L:....

S: You‚Ä¶wanna know why I‚Äôm even dealing with this? You think it‚Äôs weird that, even if you are breaching the contract, that the CEO and owner would bother with someone so low on the totem pole herself? Well‚Ä¶You‚Äôre right. It is weird. And normally, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt care enough to handle this on my own. Or even care that much at all, really. But you‚Ä¶When it comes to you, nothing is normal for me.

L:...

S: Why? I‚Äôll answer that question with this question: Can you tell me what this is?

\**Sound of a napkin being placed down on the desk in front of him*\*

L:...

S: \**exasperated sigh, maybe a little frustrated*\* Yes, I *know* it‚Äôs a napkin, I‚Äôm asking you if you recognize what's drawn *on* the napkin. Don‚Äôt get snippy with me just because you‚Äôre upset that someone finally cares enough to stop you from starving to death.

L:...

S: It is a rough sketch of a CPU, yes. Specifically, the CPU design that was the first patent I ever filed, and would ultimately be the basis on which I built this company. At the time, it was five times faster than any other CPU on the market. \**Sighs fondly*\* I drew that sketch on my break while working full time at a local cafe during grad school. I‚Äôd been sketching then scrapping it for months until one day at work everything just‚Ä¶clicked together, and I took my measly ten minute break early to sketch it down‚Ä¶ And the rest, as they say, is history.

L:...

S: Oh? That part in red ink over my black ink looks familiar to you? It should, you drew it after all.

L:...

S: I‚Äôm not surprised you don‚Äôt really remember, sweetie. It was probably just a passing moment for you, just another day as an undergrad, trying to stay afloat while double majoring in both computer science and engineering. I‚Äôve always imagined that you‚Äôd stopped in at the cafe just to get a cup of coffee to make it through the day after long hours of studying, though I guess why you were there has never really mattered. Just that you were.

S: You had been standing near my table, waiting for your order to be called. I remember I‚Äôd been scribbling on at least three separate napkins, tossing each one aside when I realized it wasn‚Äôt quite right. I guess that grabbed your attention, and at some point, you walked over. I remember you stuttered a bit, you seemed so nervous to even be bothering me. But you told me it looked like I was missing just three things to get my design working. You must‚Äôve thought it was a school assignment or something. You tried explaining it to me verbally, but I just wasn‚Äôt getting it, so you pulled out this little red pen from your bag and you drew these little edits to my design. Just three edits. Three, tiny little edits. Three changes that took my design from a good idea into a working, revolutionary product. All from three changes.¬†

S:It‚Äôs the little things that are always the hardest to figure out, you know?

S: And then, while I was staring at that napkin, not yet fully grasping the enormity of what you had done, I heard them call your name for your coffee, and you stuttered goodbye and ran off.

S: I looked for you, after that. All over campus and in town, but I could never find you. It was like‚Ä¶ Like the entire universe was conspiring to hide you from me.

S: \**genuine laugh*\* I actually delayed filing my patent for almost six months because of that, you know. At first, I had just been looking for you because I was grateful, but eventually I realized that you might actually have a claim to anything I ever made by selling this thing. That you and I might technically have some kind of joint rights to the patent, that I‚Äôd get everything I ever wanted and then you‚Äôd show up with a story about me, a napkin, and a cafe, and steal it all away in a massive lawsuit. Six months was as long as the fear could hold out against my sense of triumph and my need to succeed, though, and as you can tell, I eventually filed that patent. And I earned my fortune.

S: *\*Lean in and whisper in listeners ear\** But I never stopped looking for you, sweetie. With every year that my company grew, the amount of resources I could devote to my search got bigger and bigger, and the number of people who would turn a blind eye to less‚Ä¶ legal means of finding you grew just as much.

S: \**Pull away from ear and stop whispering*\* And eventually, years and years later, I did. Turns out, that stupid cafe got your name wrong. I‚Äôd been looking for a mispronunciation and misspelling this whole time. Not to mention that when you helped me, you hadn‚Äôt been infected yet. Back then your skin was tan and your eyes were this gorgeous natural hue, not red. Not that red doesn‚Äôt suit you sweetie, it absolutely does. But that made finding you all the more difficult, because I hadn‚Äôt been looking for a Vampire.¬†

S: Eventually though, I did find you. And I started to gather as much information as I could on you. At first, it was so I could figure out the best way to thank you for all you‚Äôd done for me, while also getting you to relinquish all claims to my patent. As I watched you though, I realized that you‚Äôd never try to claim my patent as yours. Watching you at that tiny little tech company you were way too good for, I watched you always give credit and build up everyone around you before you ever took any for yourself. I very much doubt a man who helps his colleagues get raises and promotions at his own detriment would try and claim my patent based on three little drawings he made years ago. Even if you would‚Äôve had every right too.

S: Once I was sure I had nothing to worry about as far as the patent went, I was very, very excited to swoop into your life and start to properly thank you for all you‚Äôd done for me. To tell you what your three little additions to that napkin had done in my life. To show you how much change and influence your small act of kindness caused.¬†

S: Only, I‚Äôd watched you long enough to know you‚Äôd never accept it. That if I showed up and tried to thank you and *properly reward you* for what you‚Äôd done, you would deny me at every turn. My only solution then, was to help you without ever letting you know I helped.

S: So‚Ä¶I bought the little tech company you worked for, and gave your whole department a raise. Then I altered all of my employee contracts to give stock options to people in your pay bracket, which was not nearly as financially stressful on the company as you might think. Then, last but not least, I had my lawyers write up some very special little clauses and help design some very unique little programs to feed *all* of the company's employees. Because I had been watching you starve yourself day after day, week after week, for *months.* You were barely surviving off of animal blood and the little bit of human blood you could afford to buy on the open market, and I could see no other way to get you a steady food source. It‚Äôs not like I could just arrange for you to ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù meet a source. Not in any way that was guaranteed to work out, at least.

S: And I thought that would be that, you know? I thought I‚Äôd done as good as I possibly could while pulling strings from the shadows, and I was ready to call all of that a success and move on to other things, content in the knowledge that I had saved my savior.

S: *\*fierce voice\** But you just. Wouldn‚Äôt. Stop. Starving yourself! And I had to watch, every single day, as you entered this building, worked hours longer than any other employee, and went home to a crappy apartment without any real sustenance in its cupboards. You were just a dozen floors below me every single day, and I was just supposed to‚Ä¶ to do nothing? To watch someone I owed the existence of this very company to just waste away under my own watchful eye?

S: \**Slam both hands on desk\** No! No, no, no, no, no! *I* am in your *debt*! You gave me my life's dream! That‚Äôs the kind of thing I can‚Äôt ever fully repay! That means that from the moment I found you again, you became my responsibility! Mine to care for, mine to worry about, mine to protect from every single danger in this world‚Ä¶even if and when that danger is yourself.

S: \**Deep calming breath*\* I‚Ä¶ I hope that answers your question about *why* I‚Äôm doing this, sweetheart. And that it helps make your choice easier. I‚Ä¶I hope you let me help you, sweetie. I don‚Äôt want to have to watch you die because you're stubborn‚Ä¶but I- I‚Äôll try to respect whatever decision you make.

S: I understand if you need time to think about all of this, honey. We can be done now and you can come back next week to tell me what you-

L: \**interrupts speaker*\*

S: Huh? I‚Äôm sorry sweetheart, can you say that again?

L:...

S: Really?!?!? Sweetheart, are you sure? I mean, I was hoping you would let me help you but I don‚Äôt want you rushing into this if-

L:...

S: Huh. \**A gentle chuckle*\* Well, alright then. That settles that, I suppose. I‚Äôll get the paperwork on your promotion and transfer to my personal team finished asap, you should have your new assignment by tomorrow. Right after you sign this contract that actually makes everything we‚Äôve discussed legally binding, of course.

\**Sound of paper being pushed forward and then the sound of a pen scribbling on the paper\**

S: Excellent. Alright, I‚Äôll get started on that transfer form‚Ä¶ Right after you get your butt over here and actually get some blood in your system, of course. And no arguments, yeah? You already signed a contract saying you‚Äôd do exactly that. Just drink slowly and only until it feels uncomfortable, ok? That shouldn‚Äôt take too long, your body isn‚Äôt ready to process a regular, full meal yet right now. We‚Äôll have to slowly ease you back up to full sized portions. For now, I‚Äôll settle for knowing you‚Äôre actually feeding properly at all. And I‚Äôll even forgive you for interrupting me again, because I‚Äôm so happy \**giggle*\*.

Hello all! This script has been kicking around my head and a google doc for literal years in one form or another. It started life as one of the first stories I ever actually started writing, but I never had any inspiration for actual plot beyond just fluff and fun interactions, so it never made it very far as a book. It kinda feels fitting, then, that this is now my first ASMR script! I hope that it's at least mostly legible, and somewhat interesting to read.

>Mabie Todd Swan Self-Filler - Stone Grey Marbled Celluloid - Branded 14k Flex Nib - C Condition

This Material is something I haven't been able to find much information on, but have come to love it over the last few weeks. It has a very beautiful, casual, unassuming look about it. If you're looking for something that wont draw too much attention to you while journaling in your favorite coffee shop, this is perfect. And as its nature, there isn't much to say about it. The pen has been freshly restored with a new sac, and nib adjusted and is ready to write.  The Nickle plated trip is in great shape on the cap, and has started to wear on the lever. As for what particular model this is I'm not 100% sure. But I can sat that with it being a swan, it is far from boring. The Nib is a Branded #2, with a perfect amount of flex and flair for casual or calligraphic writing. Cosmetically the top of the cap and the base of the body have some light scuff marks on them. Looking over the body again, there are is a little dent in the cap, but any light surface wear disappears into the material completely. This color and pattern are amazing in that way, as they will hide any fingerprints or blemishes accumulated over time. To me, I greatly prefer that in something I would want to carry with me as a daily writer. NOTE: I would not recommend posting the cap with this pen. It is not a snug fit, and it feels like the rim of the cap is the only thing making contact to the body, and I believe the cap would crack rather easy if attempted!!!

> Mabie Todd Swan Snake Skin Lever Filler (Late Model Circa Late 30s/early 40s)- Celluloid - 14k Branded Fine Flex Nib - C Condition

This is a beautiful late model Swan Snake Skin (different from lizard skin - the color itself I couldn't find a specific name for in my brief search) with gold trim lever and cap hardware. There were other models with the nickel plated trim as well. The later models such as this omits the black bonded celluloid cap and body ends that where fused to the main material, and instead the cap and body are one single pattern from top to bottom, as well as a more pronounced coloring in the middle of the tiled pattern lending a red undertone to the whole design. It gives it a beautiful hinted accent. The body and cap are free of cracks, chips, while there is a deep scratch at the top of the cap and a dent on the cap-band which also spins in its seat but is still secure to the cap with no chance of it coming off. The only other point of note is staining inside the cap and on the body threads. Fortunately there is no noticing this when the pen is capped and you cannot see through the material to the discoloration. However the price has been adjusted accordingly for the blemish. The nib is a branded #2 full flex fine. It has more of a pencil-like feedback, and lends itself to having more writing control to say a very slick and polished writing point. The pen is ready to write, and would make a perfect addition to any collection.
PRICE $225 + SHIPPING

>Mabie Todd Swan Minor No.2 - Marine Bronze Marbled Celluloid - Branded #2 14k Medium Left OB Stub - Lever Filler - B Condition

As is the deal with a lot of vintage brands, its more numbering systems I don't fully understand. But this is fairly straight forward I believe: Here is a SM2/58 (Swan Minor No2) in beautiful Marine Bronze. Full of class and character, this is ready to write and fresh off the bench. A new sac has been installed, the nib has been tuned and smoothed, and the body brought back to a good shine. These pens have a very unique feature in the sense that the lever bar on the body is colored in the same scheme as the body. Blending in and giving it a smooth, solid look all around, highlighting an eye-catching material. There are no major dents, dings, issues cosmetic or functional. There is no brassing on the pen, save for the tiniest spot on the ball of the clip. The makers mark is deep and crisp with no signs of fading or wear. A fine addition to any collection!
PRICE $225 + SHIPPING

> Mabie Todd Swan Self-Filling Pen - Jade Green No.44 Eternal Lever Filler - Celluloid - Branded 14k Fine - C Condition

A substantial size with a beautiful branded Fine nib. The material is very good in terms of coloration and luster with very minimal darkening as is common with a lot of vintage jade green celluloids. The only note of damage is a missing rib to the feed, and some brassing on the lever. This does not impact functionality but has been accounted for in the price. Cosmetically, there are no dents, dings, scratches, or chips to be found. The makers-mark is present and clear. The nib has semi-flexible properties that gives a very nice expression when writing - similar to a wahl signature nib if you have experience with those! The sac is freshly replaced and nib adjusted to a nice mid ground smoothness.
PRICE $275 + SHIPPING

>Sheaffer Balance Grey Striated White Dot - Lifetime 2-tone 14ct Fine Nib - B Condition

Sheaffer is not my specialty when it comes to model identifiers, and so I will do my best to give the information I have on me. The only thing of note with this pen vs. other Sheaffer pens is this one having some custom work to the cap band. It has been modified with this stunning slotted knurling giving it a very smooth and unique feel. The pen has been freshly restored with a new sac and nib checked for any needed changes, though it was perfect from the get go. The Nib is firm as a nail, but it is a Sheaffer, and writes like a smooth dream. A proper fit for anyone looking for a solid, reliable work horse that will go anytime, every time. The Striped Grey Celluloid is beautiful and retains its luster and depth. The ink window is clear and transparent. There are no dents, dings, scratches or blemishes on the pen, and there is no plating loss on either the clip or the cap-band, and the barrel imprint is nice and clear. If you are also looking to take a plunge into the world of vintage pens, I will always recommend people starting with a good Sheaffer. Timeless, classic, and consistent. This may not have all the vintage bells and whistles in nuance like some other brands, but it is the one that will always be there when you need it!
PRICE: $120 + Shipping

>Lapis Parker Lady Duofold (Large Single Cap-Band) - C Condition for non-original nib. - 14k Warranted Medium nib

A good and clean example all around. The Lapis material has maintained a very crisp and lustrous color over the years for being around 100 years old. The makers imprint is clear and deep. The pen is a button filler, has been thoroughly cleaned, and a new sac has been installed. It writes with a semi-flexible medium line without any issue. This pen as it has been a part of my collection for quite some time, and has been used extensively to the point of i can confidently say that this would make an absolutely stunning piece to any daily carry. There are no major blemishes cosmetically, and no issues mechanically. A very important note for any potential buyer: Do not at any time pull the section off of the pen, as this being a button filler it will not reinstall properly - if the section is simply reinstalled the sac will get bound up on he pressure bar and not be usable. The nib on this is brilliantly smooth and has delightful expression to it.

Dear H,

Met you Mondays... coffee break.  
Laughs like sunlight... real, not fake.  
Felt it grow... this stupid seed.  
Thought you wanted... what I need.  
But after clock-out... radio silence.  
Your number rings... straight to voicemail.

You say ""friends""... yeah, I heard it.  
But your actions... scream ""avoidance"".  
Texts left blue... like frozen sky.  
Guess ""friends"" means... don't even try.

  
I kept watering... a dead plant.  
You only bloom... when work demands.  
All this hope... just empty dirt.  
Yeah, I'm done... playing hurt.  
Dead plant... dry roots...  
Worn out boots... walking past you.

  
Saw you Friday... by the copier.  
Smiled like June... warm and brighter.  
Asked ""This weekend?""... you just sighed.  
""So busy... maybe next time?""  
Felt that familiar... hollow thud.  
Another promise... lost in mud.

You say ""sorry""... yeah, convenient.  
But your calendar's... permanently vacant.  
For anyone... who ain't the clock.  
This ""friendship"" thing... feels like a lock.  


Saw the cracks... in your ""I swear..."".  
Felt the drought... in the air.  
Your silence grew... deeper roots.  
Than your words... those wilted shoots.  
Realized...  
This pot's just... empty earth.  
My effort's... zero worth.  
  
Stop watering... the dead plant.  
You only live... where time's demanded.  
All that hope... was barren land.  
Yeah, I'm done... understand?  
Dead. Plant.  
Turned my back... at last.  
last.

Recently, I got the chance to try the Waterdrop WD-15UB-UF Ultra Filtration Under Sink Water Filter System, and I‚Äôve been using it daily for over two months now. It boasts an impressive filtration accuracy of 0.01 Œºm and claims to reduce lead, chlorine, bad tastes, and odors effectively. While I was initially drawn to its sleek design and promise of clean water without bottled alternatives, not every aspect of it left me as impressed. Here‚Äôs my honest breakdown after some thorough testing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unboxed the filter system, its build quality stood out. The brushed nickel finish on the dedicated faucet looks premium, and its lead-free, BPA-free construction is a reassuring touch for anyone concerned about water safety. The compact design of the main filter unit made it a breeze to fit under my sink, even in a relatively tight kitchen setup. Another standout for me was the activated carbon, made from natural coconut shells, which highlighted the manufacturer‚Äôs efforts toward sustainability. However, a slight downside is that the filter casing, albeit sturdy, has a basic appearance that might not appeal to those looking for a more visually modern system to match their interiors.

**Ease of Installation**  
As someone who isn‚Äôt particularly skilled in DIY, I was relieved at how simple it was to install this under-sink filter. The innovative push-to-connect fittings are genuinely a game-changer. I didn‚Äôt even have to call my handyman! With minimal tools and following the manual, installation was done in about 15 minutes. Connecting it to the cold water supply was intuitive, and replacing the filter cartridge is just as simple, thanks to the twist-and-lock mechanism. However, the adapters included for various sink types seemed a little flimsy ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt want to tug them too hard.

**Filtration Performance**  
Now, onto what really matters: how well does this system clean water? I ran multiple taste tests to compare my tap water pre- and post-filtration. The difference was noticeable ‚Äì post-filtration, the chlorine taste was almost non-existent, and the water tasted fresher, reminiscent of what you might get from a natural spring. The ultrafiltration membrane, with its 0.01 Œºm filtration accuracy, filters out bacteria and heavy metals like lead with impressive efficiency. I also tested filling up water for cooking, percolating coffee, and even daily hydration; it was consistent across the board. However, its maximum flow rate of 0.75 gallons per minute may feel slow if you‚Äôre filling a large pot, especially in a busy household.

**Advantages**  
- Multistage filtration effectively reduces chlorine, lead, and sediment.  
- Ultra-long lifespan at up to two years or a staggering 16,000 gallons.  
- Comes with a premium, separate drinking faucet for safety.  
- Compact design fits tight spaces, making it perfect for smaller kitchens or apartments.

**Market Rivals**  
I‚Äôve compared the Waterdrop system to competitors such as Culligan and APEC water filters, and there are some interesting differences. While Culligan systems tend to be priced similarly, their cartridges don‚Äôt last as long, making the Waterdrop solution more cost-effective over time. On the other hand, APEC filters often offer higher flow rates but are significantly bulkier. For compact setups and ease of use, the Waterdrop system edges out its rivals. However, Culligan‚Äôs on-demand customer support is something Waterdrop could aspire to improve upon, especially since I had a hard time locating help when troubleshooting.

**Pluses**  
- The push-to-connect fittings significantly reduce installation time.  
- Adaptable for multiple uses, from the kitchen to RV installations.  
- Natural coconut-based carbon ensures eco-friendly filtration practices.  

**Limitations**  
- Flow rate may be slower than some users expect.  
- Adapters, though functional, might feel unsubstantial for long-term durability.  

**Smart Spending**  
This water filter provides good cost-efficiency compared to other under-sink solutions. Given its 16,000-gallon capacity, you‚Äôre looking at significant savings by reducing bottled water use ‚Äì better for the planet and your wallet. While the initial cost might seem steep for some, its long lifespan more than makes up for it. I‚Äôd categorize this as an excellent investment for small to medium-sized households prioritizing clean drinking water or who simply want to avoid frequent cartridge changes.

1o1kfke,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o1kfke/theres_something_wrong_with_the_baby_motior/,There's something wrong with the baby motior,"**September 9**

Dr. Kaplan insists I start writing things down. She calls it a ‚Äúgrief journal,‚Äù though I hate the word. This isn‚Äôt supposed to be a novel. Just a diary, private between me and her. She wants me to capture my thoughts while they‚Äôre raw, not after I‚Äôve smoothed them over with excuses or rehearsed versions I tell other people.

So here it is: babysitting.

Claire goes to her evening group twice a week, and she asked if I could watch Noah while she‚Äôs gone. I wasn‚Äôt going to say yes. Since the miscarriage, I‚Äôve avoided babies, the sight of them in grocery carts, the sound of them crying in Target, even the photos friends post on Instagram. Now I‚Äôm supposed to hold one? Rock him to sleep? Pretend I don‚Äôt feel like my chest is splitting open? But when I mentioned it in session, Dr. Kaplan‚Äôs eyes lit up. ‚ÄúExposure therapy,‚Äù she called it. Said maybe spending time with Noah will help me face what I lost instead of avoiding it. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs right. But Claire needs me. And maybe I need this too.

Noah went down easier than I expected. I rocked him for maybe twenty minutes, sang the first lullaby that came to mind, a half-remembered jingle from my own childhood, and he blinked at me slowly until his eyes slid shut. Now I‚Äôm sitting on Claire‚Äôs couch with the monitor on the coffee table. The faint static fills the room like a second heartbeat.

It‚Äôs quiet. Too quiet.

I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll last with this.

**September 10**

Noah screamed for almost an hour tonight. My arms shook from the weight of him, sweat running down my back. I tried everything: bouncing, pacing circles, humming every song I could remember. He only cried harder. Finally, I gave up and set him down, defeated. And of course, he quieted within thirty seconds. Just lay there hiccuping, fists clenched.

And then it hit me like a knife: *what if mine had lived?* Would I have handled nights like this, or would I have broken apart? Would I have been enough?

I came downstairs, made a cup of tea, and tried to distract myself. I flipped through Netflix and landed on a dating show I‚Äôd never admit to watching out loud. Plastic smiles, staged drama. But for twenty minutes, I didn‚Äôt think about anything else. When Claire got home, she kissed me on the cheek and whispered, ‚ÄúThank you, you‚Äôre saving my life.‚Äù

I laughed it off. But I cried in the car.

**September 12**

Tonight went better. Noah fussed for maybe ten minutes before curling against my chest, his breath damp and hot through my shirt. For a moment, I let myself imagine it was my baby. What if I‚Äôd carried to term? What if nights like this were mine? I shouldn‚Äôt, but I did.

After he was asleep, I made chamomile tea. Halfway through, I realized I was using Michael‚Äôs Red Sox mug. My stomach dropped. I felt like I was trespassing, but it was right at the front of the cupboard, like Claire still wants it used. The house is full of him even though he‚Äôs gone. Pictures of their wedding still flood the walls. His jacket still hangs by the door. His shoes are still in the closet.

I tried a thriller on Netflix but barely watched it. Just stared at the monitor on the table, Noah‚Äôs breathing like waves on a shore. When Claire came home, she looked tired but lighter. She said her group helps. I didn‚Äôt ask more. She switched the subject, asking about Noah. I told her that earlier we played with blocks. By ‚Äúplayed,‚Äù I mean I stacked them, and he knocked them over. He laughed so hard he toppled backward.

I realized on the drive home that I was laughing as well.

**September 13**

Noah woke around midnight. When I went in, he wasn‚Äôt crying. He was staring at the corner near the dresser, eyes wide like he was watching something move. Then he giggled.

It wasn‚Äôt for me.

I whispered his name, but he kept laughing, reaching upward like someone taller than me was just out of sight. When I picked him up, he fussed, pushing at me, like he didn‚Äôt want me, like he wanted someone else. Maybe he missed his mom. Whatever it was, it stung more than I want to admit

**September 14**

Claire says babies ‚Äúentertain themselves.‚Äù She laughed when I told her Noah stares at corners, said maybe he already has an imaginary friend.

  
  
  


**September 15**

I was rocking Noah tonight and he wouldn‚Äôt stop crying. I finally muttered, ‚ÄúFine, you don‚Äôt want me, I‚Äôll give you a minute,‚Äù and set him back down. I regretted what I said. Sure, he didn‚Äôt understand me, but it felt like I was spitting venom at a ten-month-old.

He went quiet almost instantly.

Then he laughed. Not tired giggles. Belly laughter, pure joy.

At what?

I stood there with my hand on the crib rail, listening to him laugh in the dark.

I whispered, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù before I could stop myself.

Of course, nothing answered. But walking out, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling I‚Äôd interrupted something.

**September 16**

I almost didn‚Äôt write tonight. My hands are still shaking from what happened.

It was just after midnight. I was on the couch with the monitor beside me, half-asleep, the screen glowing faintly in the dark. At first, it was nothing unusual: soft rustles, Noah babbling to himself. His little squeals actually made me smile. I leaned closer, listening. The static rose and fell with his breathing. I remember thinking how innocent it sounded.

Then there was a pause. A long, unnatural pause. The kind where every muscle in your body tenses because you‚Äôre waiting for the cry that never comes.

Instead, there was a faint noise, like the shifting of fabric or weight settling on the crib mattress. Not Noah‚Äôs weight. Heavier.¬†

I told myself not to be stupid. Houses make sounds. Baby monitors pick up interference. But my eyes wouldn‚Äôt leave the screen. Noah giggled suddenly, sharp and delighted, as if someone had played peek-a-boo.¬†

And then, through the tiny speaker, clear and low and close as if someone were right there beside him:

‚ÄúHey, buddy.‚Äù

I had never run faster in my life. Up the stairs, down the hall, until I burst into the nursery and switched on the lights.

Nothing.

Noah cried violently while I searched the room. The closet, under the crib, every inch of it. Noah was the only person in the room. The windows were locked, I triple checked. I scooped him up and pressed him to my chest until his cries softened; my hands were shaking so hard I nearly dropped him back into the crib. I turned the lights off and went back downstairs, my heart pulsing in my throat.

The monitor has been quiet since. But I keep glancing at it, terrified it will come alive again. And what terrifies me most is how that voice sounded. Not threatening. Not cruel. Loving. And that‚Äôs somehow worse.",1,1759951795.0,creepcast,0,0.99,False
1o1kf74,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShapewearStories/comments/1o1kf74/buttlifter_shorts_and_living_in_the_present/,Buttlifter Shorts and Living in the Present Moment ‚Ä¶What?,"https://preview.redd.it/k3lqinx5iyrf1.jpg?width=868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26e4c20a51bca0c587e85a777404921c8d691e62

# Butt Shapers and Consciousness?

Buttlifter shorts, like all types of shapewear, seem like plain old articles of (albeit stretchy) clothing, not zen talismans of cosmic transcendence. True enough. But the case can be made that clothing that really holds you provides an ongoing reminder; it helps you pay attention to your present experience. And would it be a stretch to say that your present experience is all that exists in your universe? Read on, and I shall outline the argument that shapewear can shape not only your curves but your consciousness in general.

# Your Attention Is Everything

If consciousness is the awareness of experience, then can we boost our consciousness by paying better attention? Yes! Can we improve our attention by wearing buttlifter shorts? Yes! Okay, that sounds a little silly, but shapewear can actually remind you to live in the moment. Sometimes ordinary things, especially things you wear, can spark a fresh awareness of your experience. Consider rosary bracelets, recovery coins, and even wedding rings as examples.

# The Buttlifter Shorts Effect

So you slip some shaping underwear on in the morning. You certainly notice them at first. You feel how they shape your body, how they maybe help you stand taller, maybe even how they give you a confidence boost. Then as your day unfolds, you forget you have them on. So you‚Äôre at work, running errands, laughing with friends, completely unaware, and suddenly you remember. Maybe you catch your reflection or just notice how good you feel moving through the day. Again and again you remember you have them on, and it pulls you back and anchors you in the present moment.

# Everyday Anchors

Living in the present is not about meditation retreats, ringing bells or burning incense. It‚Äôs about noticing what is happening right now. It is about being fully conscious. Memories of the past? They‚Äôre thoughts happening now. Worries about the future? Those are present-moment images in your mind. Realize this and you can choose almost anything as your anchor to bring your attention back to the present.

# End the Day Where You Began

So tomorrow morning, take a pause. Start your day with attention to the present moment. Notice how incredibly special you are. Let something, whether it‚Äôs shapewear, morning coffee, the dog‚Äôs bark, or just the sunlight across your kitchen counter ‚Äì let it remind you that life is happening right now. And the more you notice it, the richer it feels.",1,1759951773.0,ShapewearStories,0,1.0,False

Hey all, I really need some suggestions on how to work around my weird living room layout, any ideas suggestions questions would help tremendously. Thanks in advance!

It has windows and doors on all four wallsü•≤there‚Äôs also a big fireplace and mantle taking up some room which I insisted to keep because of the ‚ú®vibe‚ú® but honestly I‚Äôm now regretting it (we thought of removing them initially and sealing the wall). In rooms like this I know you can arrange furnitures in the middle instead of putting them against the wall, but our room is small 12x18. Kitchen and dining room connects to the living room through one of the openings, and across the room is the opening for the entrance hallway+access to the second floor. That means we walk across the living room all the time and we want to take into consideration of foot traffic, how big the furnitures should be, to what extent they block the traffic etc. Do I want to have a comfortable couch and a TV and a coffee table and corners for plants and side tables? Absolutely. But I can‚Äôt have it all. The room is small and so‚Ä¶asymmetrical? The focal points on each wall don‚Äôt align. E.g. fireplace and mantel are shifted to the button (referring to the picture), the big window on the opposite wall where i potentially put a couch is shifted upward.

This is the only living room in our new house, so there‚Äôs no second family room/tv room (although we do have a huge basement we plan to renovate next year to be a bigger family room but it is just concrete at the moment, unlivable). We often have parents siblings stay with us and sometimes they‚Äôre here for months, a place to relax for them is kind of a must. That why I‚Äôm expecting so much from this room and not sure what to compromise. Please help a girl out.

Do you feel like you‚Äôre made of contradictions? Tired but restless. Lonely but full of love. Idealistic but a little bruised from trying too hard in a world that often doesn‚Äôt meet you halfway. Because me too

I'm 26, based in Italy, and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life‚Äôs not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won‚Äôt just get me, but who‚Äôs also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren‚Äôt a priority for you, we‚Äôre not meant for each other.

But this post isn‚Äôt just about politics. It‚Äôs about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go ‚Äúso I was just thinking...‚Äù

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there‚Äôs beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn‚Äôt found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night ‚Äúwhat even is happiness?‚Äù kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who‚Äôll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other‚Äôs chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

If any of this resonates, I'd like to get to know you. Tell me who you are when no one‚Äôs watching. Share your favorite lyric, your latest overthought idea, or just say hi. No filters needed.",2,1759951250.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1o1k6e2,https://i.redd.it/nbxyc9jluxtf1.jpeg,Where Love Lies Buried,"The day I found out Liam was cheating again, I let out a long, slow sigh of relief.

This was the latest in a long, unbroken line of betrayals, and always with the same woman.

Over the phone, his breaths were shallow and quick as he claimed to be in a meeting.

I stretched languidly, gazing out the window at the endless night, and hung up.

I thought of the vow we‚Äôd made so long ago: If I ever betray you, may I die a horrible death.

A shame no one ever actually dies from it. But the betrayal is always real.

I drafted the divorce papers. This broken, rotten marriage was over.

1.

Liam came home at three in the morning.

He had a satisfied, languid smile on his face as he came to wrap his arms around me on the sofa. A faint trace of perfume, a scent that wasn't mine, drifted into my nose.

The old me would have flown into a rage.

Where were you? Who were you with? Why does your shirt smell like that?

Then would come the screaming, the crying, the sound of things breaking. Liam would soothe me with some nonsensical excuse, and I, pathetically, would believe him.

But that was the old me. The me who was obsessively, blindly in love with him.

I used to spend hours staring at a photo of us at seventeen. The boy in that picture, the one who had loved me with such sincerity, was frozen in time.

Before he left to study abroad in London, he‚Äôd grabbed my hands, his eyes intense. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare betray me,‚Äù he‚Äôd said.

‚ÄúWhoever betrays the other will die a horrible death.‚Äù

Back then, fueled by love, even a vow that dark sounded sweet.

Then came the call across time zones. A girl‚Äôs voice answered his phone, telling me he was in the shower. The call didn‚Äôt end when the water shut off. I heard their panting breaths, their quiet murmurs.

I knew. I sent him a novel-length breakup text.

He flew back immediately to win me over, the ghost of that same perfume still clinging to him.

‚ÄúKaley, she‚Äôs just a classmate. Nothing happened. We were just out for a run.‚Äù

And just like that, I believed him. It seems so absurd now.

Liam‚Äôs deep voice rumbled above my head, pulling me from the memory. ‚ÄúWhy are you still up?‚Äù

Breathing in that familiar, foreign scent, I gently pushed him away.

As he stared, confused, I placed the freshly printed divorce agreement on the coffee table.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get a divorce.‚Äù

Liam scoffed and tried to pull me into a hug again. I shoved him off. I just sat there, watching him with an unnerving calm as his composure began to crumble.

He shot to his feet, pacing back and forth with his hands on his hips. ‚ÄúI told you, I was in a meeting. I was late, okay? But I came home, didn‚Äôt I? I didn‚Äôt stay out all night!‚Äù

2.

The midnight curfew was a rule established after one of his many betrayals.

He‚Äôd promised to abide by it, and for a few weeks, he actually had, turning down after-work drinks and dinners. But he couldn‚Äôt turn down an invitation from her.

I had only met Zoe once. When Liam returned for good from London, he didn‚Äôt come to see me first. She showed up at my door, asking for a pair of his underwear to bring to him.

It was a blatant provocation. I shoved her out and slammed the door. But her woody, cloying perfume lingered in the apartment we had decorated together over video calls.

From then on, whenever I smelled that scent on him, I knew he‚Äôd been with her.

And every single time, Liam had a ready-made excuse.

He‚Äôd met with her to discuss a joint business venture.

He‚Äôd run into her by chance outside the office and they‚Äôd just grabbed a quick lunch.

It was a class reunion; everyone was there.

And each time, he would look me in the eye, his gaze achingly sincere, and swear, ‚ÄúNothing happened. If I betrayed you, Kaley, may I die a horrible death.‚Äù

And I would believe him.

I looked up at the man who had been the centerpiece of my entire youth. All the obsession, the unwillingness to let go‚Ä¶ it had all vanished. I couldn't find a trace of it.

Liam was still rambling, and I repeated, my voice flat. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get a divorce.‚Äù

He froze, standing ramrod straight in front of me. It was finally dawning on him that this wasn‚Äôt a tantrum. It wasn‚Äôt like the other times. I wasn‚Äôt throwing things. I wasn't screaming. I wasn‚Äôt even pointing out the evidence and demanding an explanation.

I was just calmly ending it.

He crouched in front of me, raising his hand to make that same, tired vow.

‚ÄúIf I did anything to betray you, may I die a horrible death.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you can go die.‚Äù

His eyes widened, the color draining from his face. This time, I didn't rush to cover his mouth, whispering, ""I believe you."" This time, I accepted his offer.

3.

Liam looked like a robot that had just been powered down, his hand falling limply to his side.

Outside, a roll of thunder broke the silence, and the sky opened up.

His phone rang, a shrill intrusion. I glanced at the screen. The contact name read, ‚ÄúZoe from Accounting.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. A plausible, professional-sounding alias. But I already knew.

After all, what kind of colleague texts you at midnight saying, I miss you so much. There‚Äôs a thunderstorm and I‚Äôm scared. Can you come be with me?

Liam declined the call. A second later, it rang again.

I watched him struggle. ‚ÄúGo on, answer it. She‚Äôs afraid of thunder.‚Äù

A tremor went through him. He grabbed my hand, his face a mask of panic. ‚ÄúKaley, let me explain. She and I are just‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù I said, cutting him off. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting divorced. You can tell her the good news. You won‚Äôt have to sneak around anymore. You won‚Äôt have to rack your brain for those ridiculous, logic-defying excuses.‚Äù

I still didn‚Äôt understand it. How could he claim to love me and then run to her bed without a second thought? And he was so good at protecting her. After that one time she came to my door, I never saw her again, no matter how hard I tried.

Once, I‚Äôd followed his phone's GPS, running through the neighborhood in my pajamas and slippers. I was going to catch him in the act, leave him with no excuses left. I beat on the door of the apartment, but there was no answer, just a heavy, mocking silence from the other side. They were in there, together. That perfume, its phantom scent, was a constant reminder that she had never really left.

It was only later I realized he had installed a GPS tracker on my phone, too. He was always one step ahead.

From his studies in London to his return home, through our entire marriage, Zoe had been a ghost haunting our lives.

Time and time again, I would look at the face of the seventeen-year-old boy in the photo and forgive the twenty-seven-year-old man in my bed.

Finally, at twenty-eight, I threw the photo in the trash.

4.

I was so tired. I didn‚Äôt have the energy to believe another one of his clumsy lies.

But then he did something new. He dropped to his knees and started to cry.

‚ÄúI was alone in London,‚Äù he sobbed. ‚ÄúI didn't know anyone. I lost my wallet, all my IDs, everything. I was just wandering the streets, completely lost, and she found me. She helped me get everything replaced. She was with me through that whole dark time.‚Äù

His eyes, glistening with tears, looked up at me.

During those years he was away, I‚Äôd turned down every advance, every offer of a date. I wrote him letters every week, sent him boxes of homemade cookies because I was afraid he‚Äôd be lonely. I stayed up through the night, waiting for a time we could talk, telling him over and over again, I love you. I‚Äôm waiting for you.

It was clear now that none of that mattered as much as Zoe‚Äôs physical presence.

He hugged my legs, his face wet with tears. ‚ÄúKaley, this is the last time. I‚Äôll never see her again, I promise!‚Äù

‚ÄúI swear, if I ever see her again, I‚Äôll‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll die a horrible death,‚Äù I finished for him.

His mouth hung open, his face a picture of conflict. I wanted to see just how deep his feelings for her ran. I leaned back against the sofa, looking down at him.

‚ÄúSay it. If you two ever meet again, she‚Äôll die a horrible death.‚Äù

He closed his mouth. He lowered the hand he‚Äôd raised to swear the oath.

Silence filled the room again. I watched the color drain from his face and let out a bitter laugh.

His phone rang again. This time, he answered, his voice a furious roar.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever call me again! We‚Äôre over!‚Äù

He slammed the phone down and looked at me, his eyes full of desperate hope. I watched his chest heave from the force of his shouting and just felt‚Ä¶ empty.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late, Liam.‚Äù

5.

‚ÄúFrom the moment you were in London, the two of you never stopped. I asked you, begged you, to cut ties with her, but you never did.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just found more secretive ways to see her. You faked a business proposal to show me, claiming you had to work with her. You helped her set up her company in the building next to yours so you could have ‚Äòchance encounters‚Äô and lunch every day. You organized a ‚Äòclass reunion‚Äô where, surprise, the two of you were the only ones who showed up.‚Äù

As I laid it all out, he just shook his head, muttering that it wasn't like that.

Outside, the darkness began to soften into a bruised, pre-dawn blue.

A knock on the door. A woman stood there, drenched from the rain. Liam rushed to wrap her in a towel, his eyes filled with concern. Even through the rain, I could smell that familiar, woody scent.

Zoe‚Äôs eyes were red as she stared at Liam. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòwe‚Äôre over‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you tell me you had no feelings for her? That the only reason you didn‚Äôt divorce her was because she‚Äôd take half your money?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Why are you ending things with me now?‚Äù

After that outburst, Liam looked at me, his face ashen. So that was it. He was worried I‚Äôd take his money.

Zoe‚Äôs eyes fell on the divorce papers on the table. She snatched them up. On the last page, my signature sat, quiet and final. Liam tried to grab the papers back, but she dodged him.

‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you signed it?‚Äù she shrieked. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not asking for a single penny!‚Äù

Her eyes were bloodshot, her voice cracking with desperation.

I think Liam finally snapped. He ripped the agreement to shreds, shoved her out the door, and slammed it shut. From outside, we could hear her screaming curses and questions.

I remained on the sofa. Liam fell to his knees again, sobbing apologies.

6.

After a while, the noise outside stopped, replaced by a woman‚Äôs shocked cry. ‚ÄúOh my goodness! This poor girl‚Äôs fainted!‚Äù

Liam flinched, then scrambled to his feet and threw the door open. He cradled Zoe in his arms, shaking her, his voice choked as he called her name. The girl in his arms was pale and unresponsive.

He glanced at me once, then scooped her up.

‚ÄúKaley, I‚Äôm taking her to the hospital. I‚Äôll be right back. Wait for me. I‚Äôll come back and explain everything.‚Äù

I watched him leave without a backward glance and wondered if he would ever really come back.

I just sat there on the sofa. Waiting.

At noon, I got a friend request from Zoe. She sent me a picture, a trophy of her victory. In it, Liam was asleep, his head resting on her hospital bed. Next to him was an unfolded pregnancy report.

I zoomed in on the date. Two months. Two months ago, Liam had told me he was going on a week-long business trip. He‚Äôd checked in with me every thirty minutes. But even that constant surveillance hadn‚Äôt stopped him from sneaking off to be with her.

He‚Äôs going to be a father.

He‚Äôs mine, Kaley.

Zoe‚Äôs texts popped up. I didn‚Äôt reply. I exited the chat, opened my laptop, and started revising the divorce agreement. If he was going to have a baby with her, he was damn well going to pay for it.

Then I called the movers.

By the time Liam came back, the living room was full of boxes. He stepped over them and found me in the master bedroom, directing the movers.

‚ÄúKaley, what are you doing?‚Äù

I turned to him, my voice cold. ‚ÄúPacking.‚Äù

‚ÄúKaley, Zoe‚Ä¶ she has some health issues. I need to stay at the hospital with her for a few days. Can you just wait for me? Please?‚Äù he begged.

We looked at each other, and a sudden, morbid curiosity took hold of me. I wanted to know how he would handle the baby.

A slow smile spread across my face. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

He looked immensely grateful, pulling me into a tight hug before rushing to pack a bag and hurry back to the hospital.",1,1759951231.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Do you feel like you‚Äôre made of contradictions? Tired but restless. Lonely but full of love. Idealistic but a little bruised from trying too hard in a world that often doesn‚Äôt meet you halfway. Because me too

I'm 26, based in Italy, and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life‚Äôs not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won‚Äôt just get me, but who‚Äôs also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren‚Äôt a priority for you, we‚Äôre not meant for each other.

But this post isn‚Äôt just about politics. It‚Äôs about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go ‚Äúso I was just thinking...‚Äù

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there‚Äôs beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn‚Äôt found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night ‚Äúwhat even is happiness?‚Äù kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who‚Äôll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other‚Äôs chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

If any of this resonates, I'd like to get to know you. Tell me who you are when no one‚Äôs watching. Share your favorite lyric, your latest overthought idea, or just say hi. No filters needed.",1,1759951217.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

It's been a long standing dream of mine to find someone and fall in love with while knowing them! 

That dream has made me talk to many beautiful people and here I am still hunting for that one person with whom I can share my morning coffee or tea with every day which I would make to perfection every single day. 

I love cooking and feeding the people / person I love the most, sometimes the food might be spicy, but it's filled with love the tears would only be the ones due to all the happiness and never because of any troubles. 

As a big believer of working things out than chasing that new relationship feeling, I absolutely don't shy away from putting in the efforts and showing you matter to me from the get go I hope that's not something which drives you away. 

Growing up I learnt healthy relationship is not something which divdes everything 50-50 but you do your 100% for each other everyday and I am one to put my all some days that 100% might vary but, trust me I will always be giving my all what's humanly possible to me that day everyday. 

I don't come from a perfect family, but, I come from a family that deeply loves me even when I mess up at times. That love extends to you as well when you become part of the family what I ask of you on this front is to not let those stories get to you, but, try to see them as second set of family who would always be there for you on your good and bad days. And, deeply hope your family would do the same and accept me with an open heart and open arms.

Personally I'm agnostic to worship, im not even mildly spiritual however I love my meditation which is devoid of all religion or anything ritualistic, having said that I definitely love the amazing food which is made for all festivals be it the vada, payasam and pulihora on Dussehra, or the cakes during Christmas or the biryani and haleem during Ramadan. You can safely say I'm open to all religions however if you are a Hindu and one who's parents are particular about the caste system which is followed kindly note I don't fall in the GC nor the scheduled class or tribe. 

Im currently on the fluffier side of the weight where hugging me would feel like your own gaint soft toy, however I am working on the becoming a more manageable and acceptable weight person for my 5'8"" height so fitness has been on the back burner for years now and I am finally taking it seriously to make the necessary changes from a lifestyle level. Also I'm a dusky person and you can say I rival a bear (pun intended). 

Im in the core field where I work for myself (recently) and I am on the path to make a decent living off of it.

So what I am looking for is someone who's okay with the entrepreneurial journey of mine and is patient enough to see me grow instead of wanting an established me and also someone who believes in the same or similar set of things as I have mentioned above. 

I love sharing loads of memes which I find funny and they are usually silly memes and I also happen to be a big time texter so kindly ignore me if you do not like texting as much.! 

Kindly note core value alignment is very crucial to me and I unfortunately can't ignore misalignment of these core values. Which are being humble, having a live and let live attitude, being kind to others when the other person seem to be not (within agreeable limits), being okay being in close touch with a mid sized (4 people excluding me) joint family who would definitely love you and be supportive of you and your dreams. 

Kindly also note I am looking for a relationship with the end goal being togetherness for life long in a year or two maximum if for one reason or another you don't see a future where you feel this is not something which may happen with you it would be a misalignment.

We can definitely discuss our other hobbies and interests, likes and dislikes in the dms.

1o1k4tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o1k4tl/my_name_is_eve_and_im_a_survivor_of_the_adam_and/,"My name is Eve, and I'm a survivor of the Adam and Eve project.","I wasn't always a psychopath. Neither was Adam. There were 10 of us. 

Five Adam‚Äôs and five Eve‚Äôs handcuffed together in a room with no doors. When I opened my eyes, staring at an unfamiliar ceiling, my name was Eve. 

I had no other names but Eve. There were nine bodies spread around me, including a boy, a *lump* attached to me, curled into a ball. 

Our real identities were lost, though I could recall small things, tiny splinters still holding on. 

I saw a dark room filled with twinkling fairy lights, a bookshelf decorated with titles I never read, boxes of prescribed medication sticking from an overflowing trash can. The walls were covered in sticky notes and calendars, a chalkboard bearing a countdown to a date that had long since passed. 

*‚ÄúI thought you were going to try this time? Why do you make it so hard?‚Äù*

The voice was a ghost in my head. She didn't have a name, barely an identity, but my heart knew her. She existed as a shadow right in the back of my mind, suppressed deep down. With her, I remembered the rain soaking my face, and my pounding footsteps through dirt.

When I tried to dive deeper inside these splinters, I hit a wall. It should have confused me, angered me, but I couldn't feel anger. 

There was only a sense of melancholy that I had lost someone close to me. With no proper memories, though, I didn't feel sad.I wasn't the first one awake. 

There were others, but neither of us spoke, trapped inside our own minds. Drawing my knees to my chest, I wondered what the others were feeling and thinking. 

Did they have loved ones they couldn't fully remember? 

I did know one thing. There was something wrong with my body, the bones in my knees cracking when I moved them.

Everything felt stiff and wrong, my neck giving a satisfying popping noise when I tipped my head left to right. The room was made of glass. Four glass walls casting four different versions of me. 

It was like looking into a fun mirror, each variant of me growing progressively more contorted, a monster blinking back. 

There was a metal thing wrapped around my wrist, and when I tugged it, the lump next to me groaned. I noticed the handcuff (and the lump) when I was half awake. But I thought I was hallucinating. 

The lump had breath that smelled of garlic coffee, and he snored. *Adam*, my mind told me. 

The lump‚Äôs name was *Adam*. 

Everything about me felt‚Ä¶new. Like a blank slate. I had no real thoughts or memories. The boy attached to me was different from the others. Adam was dressed in the same bland clothes, but his had colour, a single streak of bright red stained his shirt. I found myself poking it, and he leaned back, his eyes widening. 

The red was dry, ingrained into the material. Which meant at some point, Adam had been bleeding. Not a lot, and he didn't look like he had any wounds. 

I studied him. Or, I guess, we studied each other. He was a wiry brunette with freckles and zero flaws, like his face had been airbrushed. 

This wasn't the *natural* kind of airbrush. I could see where someone or something had attempted to scrape away his freckles too, the skin of his left cheek a raw pinkish colour. I wasn't a stranger to this thing either. 

I could see where several spots on my face had been surgically removed. The boy glued to my side was an enigma in a room drowned of color. 

The red on him made him stand out in a sea of white, a mystery I immediately wanted to solve. 

I couldn't help it, prodding the guy‚Äôs face, running my finger down his cheek and stabbing my nail under his nose for signs of bleeding. 

I was curious, and curiosity didn't belong in the white room full of blank slates. 

I wondered if the old me looked for that kind of thing. 

Her bookshelf *was* full of horror and crime thriller, an entire box-set of a detective series my mind wasn't allowed to remember. There was that wall again, this time slamming down firmly on the room with the fairy lights. 

There was too much of *me* in my fragmented memory, the girl who wasn't Eve. 

I wasn't fully aware that I was violently prodding Adam, until he wafted my hand away. 

The boy opened his mouth to speak, his eyes narrowing with irritation, before his mind reminded him that irritation did not exist in the white room. 

I watched the anger in his eyes fizzle out, and he frowned at me, adapting the expression of a baby deer. I think he was trying to be angry, trying to yell at me. 

When I realized he couldn't swear, or didn't know *how* to swear, he distanced himself from me, turning his back and folding his arms. 

I got the hint, shuffling away, only for the handcuffs to violently snap us back together. 

‚ÄúThis is a recorded message stated by the United States Government on eight, twenty seven, two thousand and twenty three regarding The Adam And Eve Project. Please listen carefully. This message will not be repeated.‚Äù 

A text to speech voice drew my attention to the ceiling, and next to me, Adam let out a quiet hiss. ‚ÄúYou have been unconscious for thirty five days and sixteen hours, following awakening.

It is recommended that you remain where you are.‚Äù The voice was pre-recorded, but it definitely sounded aimed toward the Adam who was crawling towards a door that *looked* like a wall, but I could see the subtle glint of a handle. 

‚ÄúTwo hundred years ago, on April 5th 2023, NASA announced the discovery of DarkSky, a potentially hazardous NEO (Near Earth Object) was estimated to miss our planet, flying by at just 19,000 miles (32,000 kilometers).‚Äù 

*Two hundred years ago.*

The robot‚Äôs voice wasn't fully registering in my brain. The text to speech voice paused, and a screen lit up in front of us displaying DarkSky, and then flickering to several news screens. 

CBS, NBC, Fox News and BBC all with red banners and panicked looking presenters. ‚ÄúHowever. During its passing, the DarkSky asteroid‚Äôs collision course changed, striking our planet on April 13th, 2023, causing global destruction and a mass extinction event.‚Äù

A screen showed us the entirety of the West Coast underwater. New York, London, Seoul, Tokyo, all of them. 

Either wiped from the map, or uninhabitable. ‚ÄúWait.‚Äù I wasn't expecting Adam to speak, his voice more of a croak.

His eyes widened, like he was remembering who he was before Adam. ‚ÄúThat's Apophis.‚Äù He scratched the back of his head. ‚Äú2029.‚Äù

Adam‚Äôs random declaration of words and numbers intrigued me. I inclined my head, motioning for him to continue, but he just shot me a look. Adam was a lot better at emotions than me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ said something.‚Äù My own voice was a static whisper. 

He blinked, narrowing his eyes. ‚ÄúNo, I didn't.‚Äù

Turning away from the boy, I decided to ignore him, and all of his future declarations. I should have been terrified, mourning the loss of not just my loved ones, but my entire planet. 

But I didn't have any memories of the world  except the rain, and a dark bedroom filled with fairy lights. I could have been a traveller, visiting every country and documenting each one. 

All of that had been taken away, and yet I couldn't feel sad or betrayed. Why would I mourn a planet I didn't remember? 

‚ÄúPlease listen carefully.‚Äù The voice continued. ‚ÄúYou have been carefully selected in a choosing process for the Adam and Eve program. Humanity's last chance of survival. Two hundred years ago, you were cryogenically frozen in an attempt to restart in a new world."" 

I nodded, drinking the words in. ""Presently for you, the earth is estimated to be habitable.‚Äù When the lights flickered off, the screen lit up, displaying exactly what the voice said. 

A new world, and the bluest sky stretching out across a never ending horizon. I found myself transfixed, smiling dazedly at brand new oceans and newly formed continents. 

‚ÄúWe ask this,‚Äù the message crackled. ‚ÄúOn behalf of the President of the United States, will you do what we couldn't? Will you make the new world a better place? Will you fix the mistakes of your predecessors and restart our sick world?‚Äù

I heard my reply before I was aware of the word in my mouth. 

*Yes.*

The screen was brighter, that beautiful blue sky so hard to look away from. ‚ÄúWill *you* create humans you are proud of?‚Äù

*Yes.*

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Adam‚Äôs murmur followed mine, the others echoing. 

‚ÄúWill *you* be our future hope? Will you destroy every human being who goes against the new earth and spill blood in the name of Adam and Eve?‚Äù

*‚ÄùYes.‚Äù*

The room flooded with light, and I blinked rapidly, drool seeping down my chin. It was the voice's next words that tore away my mind. 

‚ÄúIt is with great displeasure, however, that we must inform you there are limited resources in our stockpile.‚Äù The ceiling opened up, a large ratty bag dropping onto the ground. It was a brand new color, but this time, a mouldy green. 

Something snapped in two inside my mind. It didn't belong in the new world. It was‚Ä¶ poison from our predecessors. 

I backed away with the others, yanking Adam with me. At first, he didn't move, cross legged, a smile stretched across his lips. I don't think he noticed the bag. He was starry eyed, unblinking at the screen still filled with the new world. 

*Our* new world.

That was ours to mould into our own. ‚ÄúThere is no need for panic,‚Äù the voice said. ‚ÄúConsider this bag an artefact of the lost world. There is nothing to fear.‚Äù 

Fear.

I wasn't sure I knew what that was. Did my old self feel *fear* running through the rain? 

Did I feel *fear* witnessing my planet burn right in front of me? ‚ÄúThere can only be *one* Adam, and *One* Eve in the new world.‚Äù The voice continued. ‚ÄúPlease choose among yourselves. You have two minutes.‚Äù

I didn't experience fear when the tranquillity in the white room dissolved. 

Adam violently pulled me to my feet when an Eve with a blonde bob dove inside the bag and pulled out a gun. She shouldn't have been able to use it. Our memories were gone, our old selves footprints in the sand. 

But it was the way her fingers expertly wrapped around the butt, that made me think otherwise. The Eve didn't hesitate, and with perfect aim, blew the heads off of two Adam‚Äôs, and then another Eve. 

I watched more colour splatter and pool and stain the white room, bodies falling like dominoes. 

When an Eve stepped toward me, my Adam pulled me across the room, dipped into the bag, his fingers wrapped around a machete. He threw me a gun, and another Adam dived for it. 

Still no fear. 

I ducked and grabbed it, my hands working for me, shooting the Adam between the eyes. I realized what we needed to do to survive.

But it wasn't fear that made me kill. It was necessary for the new earth. The words were in my head, suffocating my thoughts. We had limited resources. There was no screaming, no crying, or begging. An Eve knocked me onto my face, but there was no pain. 

She kicked me in the head, plunging her knife into the back of my leg. Still no pain. 

Blood stained me, running down my chin. No pain. I didn't think, I just acted. One Adam and Eve left, and they were hardest to take down. The Eve circled me, eyes narrowed, calculating my every move. 

Adam and I communicated through nods and head gestures. Adam told me to go for the sandy haired Adam, while he would take a swipe at an Eve. 

I was taken off guard when the Adam surrendered, only to kick me onto my back, knocking Adam off balance too. I thought we were going to die. But my Adam had been following and predicting their every move. 

Back to back, I reached for my gun. Two bullets left. I managed to get Eve straight through her left eye. I didn't notice we were the only ones left until the walls were stained red, my hands coated with Adam‚Äôs and Eve‚Äôs, and the final Adam was lying in a stemming pool of blood. 

I had pieces of skull stuck in my hair, and I was out of breath, but I felt a sense of triumph.

There was so much blood, but it was the blood of the *old* world. Both of us knew that. Adam turned to me, his eyes filled with stars, his skin stained red. 

I thought he was going to hug me, but his gaze found the screen where our new world awaited us. The two of us were breathless, awaiting the next instructions. But none came. I counted hours, and then a full day. 

Adam had gotten progressively less appealing the longer I stayed isolated with him. He sat against the wall with his knees to his chest, head of matted curls against the glass, the two of us suffocating in the stink from the slow decomposition around us. The other Adam‚Äôs and Eve‚Äôs were in their first stage. 

Bloating. How did I know that? 

‚Äú2029.‚Äù Adam kept muttering to himself, over and over again. 

It was the same number, repeatedly. I couldn't feel anger or irritable, but I was confused *why* he was saying it. 

Another day went by, and I was starting to feel deeply suppressed hunger start to bleed through. I watched Adam counting to himself, his eyes closed, feet tapping on the floor, and wondered if the new world would accept cannibalism. 

Adam stared at himself in the fun-mirror a lot, making noises with his mouth. I wasn't fully concentrating when he turned to me, blurting, ‚ÄúHow big was Apophis again?‚Äù

To me, his words were alien, and I ignored him. But then he started talking again, spewing random words. ‚ÄúHuntley Diving Centre. Med school. Cheese sandwich. Man with a bald head.‚Äù

When I told him to stop, he continued. ‚ÄúVan. Cheese sandwich. Pretty Little Liars.‚Äù He knocked his head against the wall. ‚ÄúProfessor Jacobs told me to go but I didn't want to go. I told him I'd call the cops, and then I'm seeing silver.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdam.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúStop.‚Äù

‚ÄúBad news,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúVery bad news I'm not allowed to tell anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdam.‚Äù

I think I was irritated. 

""You're talking too."" He grumbled. 

Was he feeling *anger*? 

I didn't realize I was angry, until my blood was boiling, my teeth gritted together. ""Yes, because you keep singing and talking, and making mouth noises-- and you're driving me insane!"" 

His grin told me one thing. No matter what happened, and what toxic and tainted parts of humans we wanted to leave behind, we were those last remnants. 

""Don't look at me like that."" I snapped. 

He rolled his eyes. ""Like *what*?"" 

""Like that!"" I turned towards the wall, folding my arms. 

""Immature."" he muttered. 

""*I'm* the immature one?!"" 

Adam sighed. When I turned my head, his eyes flickered shut. ‚ÄúUnited States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru,‚Äù his gaze tracked the screen in front of us. ‚ÄúRepublic Dominican, Cuba, Caribbean, Greenland, El Salvador too--"" 

I don't know what possessed me to whip around, lunging at him like an animal. I got close. So close, shuffling over to him, his breath tickled my chin. 

Adam's eyes were still closed, but he was smiling, and my stomach fluttered. I leaned forward, suddenly remembering that as Adam and Eve, we had a job to do. I think he knew that too, because the second I moved closer, he jolted away. 

""I'd rather reproduce with a plant."" Adam muttered. I was suddenly consumed with fear. 

I *had* to continue the human race. 

But did it have to be with *him*? 

*‚ÄúWe‚Äôve found them!‚Äù an Adam‚Äôs voice, a *human* voice ripped me from strange, foggy-like thoughts. 

I shuffled back, swiping at my eyes. 

Was I... *crying*?

‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù

Thundering footsteps followed and something in my gut twisted. I stood up, swaying. Adam followed, half lidded eyes barely finding mine. His expression was new. I think mine was too. 

Fear. 

*Humans.*

Before I knew what was happening, I was being grabbed by masked men, who were surprisingly gentle. Humans. I didn't know what to say. 

I asked them how they survived the asteroid impact, and they told me to stay calm. 

Adam was behind me, his arms pinned behind his back. 

He was being told to stay calm, but Adam *was* calm. He may have been nodding along to the human‚Äôs words, but he was thinking exactly what I was. When an Eve cupped my cheeks and asked if I was okay, my gaze flicked to my discarded gun. 

‚ÄúOliva!‚Äù She was yelling in my face. ‚ÄúSweetie, you're in shock. Can you tell me how many fingers I‚Äôm holding up?‚Äù

I nodded dizzily, unable to tear my gaze from my weapon. ‚ÄúFive.‚Äù

**There could only be ONE Adam and ONE Eve.**

I felt fear for the first time when Adam and I were led through large silver doors and into blinding sunlight. 

When it faded and my eyes found clarity, I wasn't seeing breathtaking views of mountains and newly formed oceans. Across the road, a woman was walking her dog.

A school bus flew past, then an ambulance, a long line of traffic snaking down the road. 

I could smell Chinese food, my mouth watering. When Adam started screaming, my fear came back, and it was enough to unravel me completely, sending me to my knees. 

I was still stained in blood, wrapped in a blanket I could barely feel. My mind that had been ripped apart, that had splintered for the good of our humanity, was starting to crumble. 

Humanity didn't *need* fucking saving. 

It only truly hit me when I was sitting in the back of a cop car, Adam in the front seat, his knees pressed to his chest, that I *wasn't* a last savior of our species. 

The earth was still spinning, still alive in modern day 2023, and I was just *Eve*. 

The Eve who sat next to me in the back of the car, gently rubbing my hands, told me my name was Olivia. I was a twenty four year old student, and I had been missing for three years. Adam‚Äôs name was *Kai.*

He was twenty three, and a med student. 

No, we were *Adam* and *Eve.* 

I spent a while in another white room, but this time I wasn't forced to kill people. 

I was told I had been through  brutal torture I could not remember. I told her that was impossible, and then she calmly showed me my legs and arms. 

I was covered in burns, old and new bruises, my body sliced open and stitched up. 

With this abuse, my kidnappers had successfully turned me into a shell of myself. I was asked if I wanted therapy to revisit those memories, but I declined. I was happy being Eve, even if it was just for a while. 

I saw Adam several times, but he was never fully conscious, either strapped to a bed, muttering to himself, or cross legged on the floor, head tipped back. 

I was two months into my treatment when he barged into my room, a hospital gown only just clinging onto his ass. ""Eve."" He looked *drunk*, stumbling over to my bed. Adam grabbed my glass of water, drained half it, and spitting it out. 

""Or whatever your real name is."" He bit into my half-eaten stale cupcake. Again, Adam spat it out. ""This tastes like shit, Eve.""

""Olivia."" I said.

""Sounds fake.""

""That's one week old cupcake you're eating.""

He spat the rest out, and against all odds, I couldn't resist a smile. ""*You* look like shit."" He said, trying to lean against the wall. ""Love the hospital dress. He raised a brow. It's very *I just got out of the psych ward*.""

With his memories back, Adam was even more insufferable. I ignored that. ""Are you bleeding?"" 

I was referring to the smear of red dripping down his arm. Adam shrugged. ""It's a scratch."" He saluted me with cupcake wrapper. ""I ripped out my IV.""

I reached for my panic button, but he got there first. ‚Äú2029.‚Äù Adam said, his words slurring. ‚ÄúIhhhhs when Apophis is going to hit us.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. My re-education was going well. I was getting my emotions back in full. Which, of course, included annoyance. ‚ÄúIt's going to *miss* us.‚Äù

‚ÄúThink!‚Äù Adam hissed, pressing his finger to his lips. ‚ÄúGotta be quiet! Shhhhh!‚Äù 

Shutting the door *painfully* slowly like he was in a cartoon skit, Adam stumbled over to my bed prodding at his neck. 

‚ÄúThey stabbed me,‚Äù he said in a manic giggle, ‚ÄúBut I'm not stupid! I'm smart! I'm like sooo smart and it's been driving me crazy, but now I see it! This is why they took me away and played with my head! I was dumb at first! So, so dumb. But I remembered 2029. And it came back to me piece by *piece*, Eve.""

Adam leaned forward. ‚ÄúApophis. 2029,‚Äù he said, his breath tickling my cheek. ‚ÄúIs why we were taken.‚Äù

He burst out laughing, and I stabbed the panic button. 

‚ÄúCan't you see? April? 2029? 19,000 miles! A biiiiig lump of space rock going zooooooom!‚Äù he stopped laughing, slamming his fist into his palm. 

Impact. 

‚ÄúBANG!""

Adam‚Äôs eyes widened, his expression crumpling. ""That's what's going to happen! We lose all of them!"" He took a deep breath, and I braced myself. 

""Do *not* start singing.""

""United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru."" This time, it was with purpose, emphasising every country. 

""Adam."" 

He didn't reply, almost in spite. ""Republic Dominican, Cuba, Caribbean, Greenland, El Salvador too.‚Äù The guy shook his head. ""Don't you remember the song they taught us? That's where it's going to hit!"" 

 ""Also from a cartoon."" I corrected. 

He surprised me by wrapping his arms around me in a hug. Adam was warm. 

His scent was a mixture of toffee and bleach. I tried *really* hard to tell myself the bandage wrapped around his head was a good thing. That he was getting better. ""You don't know me, and I don't know you,"" he muffled into my shoulder. 

""But neither of us can deny what we went though-- and what they want us *for*."" His grip tightened. ""They're trying to take away what I know-- and what I *know* is that that asteroid is not going to miss.""

""Eve."" he straightened up, and he looked so vulnerable. ‚ÄúHelp me.‚Äù He whispered, before crumpling into a heap. I tried to help him, before my door swung open, several Eve's in white dragging him out. According to them, he ‚Äòwas experiencing mild side effects from treatment.‚Äô

Unlike me, Adam chose to get his memories back. Yeah, that's not a good idea. Olivia‚Äôs mind was too much, too painful. My old life started to seep back in the form of loved ones as I was slowly deconditioned. 

I stopped referring to boys and girls and Adam‚Äôs and Eve‚Äôs, and was firmly told ‚ÄúThe New Earth‚Äù was just fantasy, all of the destruction I saw generated with AI. 

I have a girlfriend, who visited me every day. She said I didn't have to take the therapy, but I know she wants me to remember Olivia. Her name is Charlie, and when I was released from the white room, she took me back to our shared house. 

I have two roommates. Sam and Matt. Both of them kept their distance for a while, especially when I accidentally referred to them as Adam‚Äôs. I'm still getting letters from the facility politely ‚Äúinviting‚Äù me for a therapy session. I‚Äôm ignoring them, but I have started seeing a single black van outside our house. I think my kidnappers are back, and I'm terrified. 

The facility told me to call them AS SOON as I see anyone suspicious. I've told Charlie and the guys to hide upstairs, and right now I'm in our living room. 

It's pitch black outside, but I can see a figure standing directly outside our house. I've  turned off all the lights. Every time I blink, I swear they're getting closer. 

And I think... fuck. I think it's *Adam.*",6,1759951137.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1o1k2sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexualdating/comments/1o1k2sm/28_m4f_looking_for_a_life_partner/,28 M4F - Looking for a Life Partner.,"Greetings! 

First of all, I‚Äôm not actually asexual, I‚Äôm here simply hoping to meet someone who also wants to match on an intellectual and emotional level. Intimacy or no intimacy isn‚Äôt really consequential for me, an authentic connection and shared-goals are what‚Äôs most important. 

About me: I‚Äôm a 28 year old straight Male, I‚Äôm currently still completing my masters degree, applying for work soon and intend to be fully invested with my work after that for the next few years & decades. 

In terms of hobbies and interests, I usually spend my free time with photography (hoping to get into film-photography soon enough), the cinema, music (so many genres lol), theatre (been to so many operas and ballets in languages I don‚Äôt speak), traveling really all the time (mostly the Old World so far), coffee (what‚Äôs your go-to favorite coffee order?), books and reading, speaking multiple languages (although English is my native), writing (both as a hobby and officially), comedy (it‚Äôs an art-form really), trying out new cuisines, visiting museum‚Äôs & galleries, being out in nature, listening to podcasts (mostly history or pop-science related), and more. 

It‚Äôs okay if your hobbies and interests are different, that way we‚Äôd both be introducing one another to a diverse range of activities and past-times for the rest of our lives. 

I understand the need for space as well, it‚Äôs okay to make changes and tune our individual lifestyle presences to vibe together as a couple. I wouldn‚Äôt want either of us to plateau, it would be great to live life truly as ‚Äúpartners‚Äù in every sense of the word. 

I‚Äôm looking for someone to do life with, to go through life‚Äôs ups and downs with and someone to grow old together with. I‚Äôm open to marriage and open to relocating for or with my future partner. 

I‚Äôm rather serious about settling down so not just looking to ‚Äúdate‚Äù someone but actively seeking a full-time monogamous relationship. Don‚Äôt want to be texting forever, not here looking for a penpal where we would just be light on a screen for each other. If we don‚Äôt exist for real together in reality then we‚Äôd just be in love with ideas of one another, not our real selves.

Honestly? Just hope that we really like each another and our goals in life are in alignment. 

I believe that not everything has to be perfect, some red flags are expected and as long as we‚Äôre willing to work on ourselves, on each other and we‚Äôre both willing to put in equal effort into the relationship that‚Äôs what matters the most. 

It‚Äôs natural to have differences, what‚Äôs important is being accepting of our differences and converging our lives paths into one path together.  

Honesty, kindness, trustworthy, a sense of humor are some qualities in a future partner that are most important to me. Someone who means they say, lives up to their words & promises and does no 180‚Äôs.

So, yeah... If what you‚Äôve read so far resonates with you, it‚Äôd be lovely to hear from you. I‚Äôm open to sharing portrait-selfies so we have an idea of who we‚Äôre talking to. ",2,1759951009.0,asexualdating,1,0.75,False

Hello!! 

It's been a long standing dream of mine to find someone and fall in love with while knowing them! 

That dream has made me talk to many beautiful people and here I am still hunting for that one person with whom I can share my morning coffee or tea with every day which I would make to perfection every single day. 

I love cooking and feeding the people / person I love the most, sometimes the food might be spicy, but it's filled with love the tears would only be the ones due to all the happiness and never because of any troubles. 

As a big believer of working things out than chasing that new relationship feeling, I absolutely don't shy away from putting in the efforts and showing you matter to me from the get go I hope that's not something which drives you away. 

Growing up I learnt healthy relationship is not something which divdes everything 50-50 but you do your 100% for each other everyday and I am one to put my all some days that 100% might vary but, trust me I will always be giving my all what's humanly possible to me that day everyday. 

I don't come from a perfect family, but, I come from a family that deeply loves me even when I mess up at times. That love extends to you as well when you become part of the family what I ask of you on this front is to not let those stories get to you, but, try to see them as second set of family who would always be there for you on your good and bad days. And, deeply hope your family would do the same and accept me with an open heart and open arms.

Personally I'm agnostic to worship, im not even mildly spiritual however I love my meditation which is devoid of all religion or anything ritualistic, having said that I definitely love the amazing food which is made for all festivals be it the vada, payasam and pulihora on Dussehra, or the cakes during Christmas or the biryani and haleem during Ramadan. You can safely say I'm open to all religions however if you are a Hindu and one who's parents are particular about the caste system which is followed kindly note I don't fall in the GC nor the scheduled class or tribe. 

Im currently on the fluffier side of the weight where hugging me would feel like your own gaint soft toy, however I am working on the becoming a more manageable and acceptable weight person for my 5'8"" height so fitness has been on the back burner for years now and I am finally taking it seriously to make the necessary changes from a lifestyle level. Also I'm a dusky person and you can say I rival a bear (pun intended). 

Im in the core field where I work for myself (recently) and I am on the path to make a decent living off of it.

So what I am looking for is someone who's okay with the entrepreneurial journey of mine and is patient enough to see me grow instead of wanting an established me and also someone who believes in the same or similar set of things as I have mentioned above. 

I love sharing loads of memes which I find funny and they are usually silly memes and I also happen to be a big time texter so kindly ignore me if you do not like texting as much.! 

Kindly note core value alignment is very crucial to me and I unfortunately can't ignore misalignment of these core values. Which are being humble, having a live and let live attitude, being kind to others when the other person seem to be not (within agreeable limits), being okay being in close touch with a mid sized (4 people excluding me) joint family who would definitely love you and be supportive of you and your dreams. 

Kindly also note I am looking for a relationship with the end goal being marriage in a year or two maximum if for one reason or another you don't see a future where you feel this is not something which may happen with you it would be a misalignment.

We can definitely discuss our other hobbies and interests, likes and dislikes in the dms.

This is kind of an update post but I also genuinely want to know if IATAH

for other information about my feelings/situation towards my house mate you can see my previous post. Which I may reference here.

To simplify what happened. Me(29m) and my wife(29f)
And our kids went away for the weekend camping. For some reason I decided to put a camera in our bedroom.

We up on returning I checked the camera and caught the house mate entering out bedroom it was dark so could see exactly what he took but could see he went the my wife's wardrobe.

After showing my wife she confronted him and he denied it until we told him we had it on camera. Then he claimed he entered out bedroom to borrow lube???? So he could wank. 

Whilst it's hard to say if it's true or not. We do have a big bottle of lube I purchased years ago that is nearly every used. So I went and checked it and sure enough it basically empty. 

So now I have a few problems. As this indicates his been entering our room multiple times as the lube being gone as well as he knew exactly where in the bedroom to look. This a long with the fact I only rearranged the bedroom 2 months ago means he knew the new spot it was placed. 

The next problem I have with him coming in besides the fact it is my personal space is that 
We keep everything in our room from our family safe. Legal documents, personal belongings. And the wardrobe he entered is where my wife keeps her underwear and such as well. 

To top it all off I've always had the rule of no one in my room. Not even cleaners if we have them come. 

So with this having happened I reached out to him and his mother as he does everything through her. 
And sent her a very honest text you can read below:

Hi ((the mother) and (tenant). 

I'm not going to beat around the bush. What (tenant) has done has broken the most serious of boundaries and trust. 

I refuse to accept any excuses. Because frankly there's isn't one.

Allowing (tenant) into our living room and kitchen to help himself to our coffee,oven,ECT was out of our kindness and hospitality. 

Entering our private room and stealing from us has completely crossed the line and can't be down played we also know this has been several times in the last two months and probably more. 

Worst he lied straight to (wife) face when asked so I can't believe anything further he says regarding the manner of why. We keep many personal things in our room our family safe, documents. Mel's and my personal items. I don't know what the real reason he went in there but none are acceptable.

We fostered a relationship and helped (tenant) in many ways to help him grow. But a long the way the help just manifested into enablement and given him the ability to endulge In bad habits like gambling. 

We set our boundaries with (tenant) so very low and he stomped all over them. 

My job is to maintain the feeling safety in this house which I thought (tenant) understood. I can no longer do so with (tenant) here. Although I dont think it's deserved at all I'm willing to allow (tenant)up to a month to organize alternative accomodation going forward. 

His current outstanding bills are the power for September $25
And recent water delivery of $55. Rent will still be expected uptill the soonest Wednesday he resides here. And (wife) laptop that was lent returned before moving out. 

I wish (tenant) the best going forward but that isn't here anymore.
.

You can find more info in my other post. 
This is what is sent. So I guess now I'm after some reassurance I'm not over reacting.

My wife doesn't seem to be as angry as me more just betrayed and disappointed as she had a better relationship with him.
I have had mixed reactions from people I've told some just saying yeah it was kinda bad to some saying why I didn't call the police. Bash the shit out of him. Or kick him out on the spot. 

So here I am. Am I justified in doing so?

Thank you.",0,1759950912.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Mariners vs. Tigers: A Playoff Thriller with a Side of Sausage**

The Detroit Tigers and Seattle Mariners are set for Game 3 of their ALDS showdown, and the stakes are higher than a hot dog at a baseball game. With the series tied 1-1, Comerica Park‚Äôs concrete jungle (aka the Tigers‚Äô home field) will host a clash of titans‚Äîthough ‚Äútitan‚Äù might be generous to the Mariners‚Äô starting pitching. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a MLB umpire and the humor of a concession stand juggling three jobs at once.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Pitchers

The numbers tell a story of mismatched destinies. **Detroit‚Äôs Jack Flaherty** (89 ERA+, 3.85 FIP) enters as a pitcher who‚Äôs been about as reliable as a traffic light on a power outage. His ERA+ below 100 means he underperformed the league average this season, and his FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching) suggests his luck might run as dry as Arizona‚Äôs desert. Meanwhile, **Seattle‚Äôs Logan Gilbert** (110 ERA+, 3.35 FIP) is the anti-Flaherty: a pitcher who‚Äôs been slightly above average and whose FIP hints at sustainability.

But here‚Äôs the twist: The Mariners‚Äô lineup thrives against right-handed pitching (Flaherty‚Äôs specialty), while the Tigers‚Äô offense struggles mightily against lefties‚Ä¶ which, ironically, is *not* what they‚Äôll face. Gilbert, a righty, will square off against Detroit‚Äôs historically lopsided platoon splits. This is like giving a left-handed golfer a right-handed club‚Äîconfusing, inefficient, and likely ending in a divot.

The **implied probabilities** from the odds? At FanDuel, Detroit checks in at **54.6%** to win, while Seattle sits at **51.5%**. DraftKings splits the difference (57.5% Tigers, 49% Mariners). These numbers scream ‚Äúpick the house,‚Äù but we‚Äôll ignore that and pretend we‚Äôre not all about to lose money on a metaphor.

### News from the Frontlines: Injuries, Momentum, and Detroit‚Äôs Home-Cooked Advantage

The Mariners are missing **Bryan Woo**, their left-handed starter, due to a pectoral injury. It‚Äôs the baseball equivalent of losing your backup coffee maker‚Äîannoying but manageable. Seattle‚Äôs bigger story i

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company‚Äîhanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server‚Äîjust hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing‚ÄîI'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM‚ÄîI'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest‚Äîmost of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats‚Äîmostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style‚Äîand I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way‚ÄîI'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives‚Äîconspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content (the drone situation and things like 3I/ATLAS have been super interesting to follow lately). I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies‚ÄîI'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now‚Äîmostly desk work‚Äîbut I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night‚Äîjust watching the lightning and chilling‚Äîthat hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

I used to have a rat and a goldfish, but sadly they passed ages ago. I don't have pets right now because I want to make sure I can give them the love and attention they deserve when the time is right.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

I'm mainly looking for genuine connections and friendships first, but I'm open to seeing where things go naturally if we really click. No pressure, no expectations.

If you're also craving something a little more real than surface-level chats, maybe we're on the same wavelength. Send me a DM or message‚Äîtimezone differences don't bother me (as long as they're not too extreme), so reach out anytime!",0,1759950627.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

Its structured well and presents the notes as very peachy a good amount of lychee which I am sure of now because I have tasted the candy and other coffee with lychee and this is the same.

When I was in Mexico visiting some family, I stopped by a coffee bean vendor whose been posted on his stand by the road for decades, at this point. I got a kilo of medium and a kilo of dark roast. Upon returning to the US, I noticed that the dark roast had a strong, unpleasant taste of alcohol, while the medium roast did not and tasted quite well. 

I took the time to dial in at different grind sized within the espresso range to see if it just needed a different grind size, but that didn't work. Then I realized that the coffee beans themselves also had a smell of alcohol, and it wasn't just the espresso shot. I presume I just got a bad batch because I sincerely doubt this dude would stay in business this long if his coffee has this kind of flavor all the time. 

Coffee is grown in Veracruz but no details about what the roasting process is/ what flavors/ notes are added, and I forgot to ask, but I doubt they pour in tequila to add flavor lol. My siblings, dad, and uncle also got some dark roast from this person and when I asked them none of them appear to have gotten the same taste I did from the beans.

I'm curious if there's a way to balance out the flavor or if I should just toss the beans",2,1759950358.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I (44M) have a crush on my new coworker (44F). She's been with the company a few months now and I see her sporadically around the office. She works quite a lot remotely and so did I during the summer so we've interacted about a dozen times during lunch and coffee breaks. I kinda fancied her from the start, but I wasn't sure if she was even single, so I didn't let myself think anything more. However, the week before last I learned that she actually is single and somehow that just hit me like a lightning bolt. I can't stop thinking about asking her out. I haven't felt like this in 20 years. I feel so juvenile and stupid and I'm pretty sure she will say no, but I need to know for sure.

We can all agree that asking a coworker out is dumb. I've accepted that. So, what I need advice on is how to exactly make my move and ask her out. My priorities are the following:

1. Do not embarrass her or make her uncomfortable.
2. Do not make myself look like a creep and/or get reported to HR.
3. Get a definite 'yes' or 'no' aswer.
4. Increase the chances of a 'yes', if possible.
5. Do not embarrass myself.

I think that the best option would be asking her face to face for example on a lunch break out of office, but the problem is that she's not that often at the office. Even then I would somehow need to arrange it so that at some point it would be just the two of us, so I could ask discretely. I had this kind of situation before I knew she was single, we were walking back to the office chatting and the others in our group we're quite far away. I'm beating myself up for not acting then. Coffee breaks might also be an option, but she rarely attends those and it's even harder to get an opportunity to speak to her alone.

It could be more easily arranged that I go talk to her at her desk when there's no one within hearing distance, but I'm a little bit hesitant to distract her when she's working and she might feel a bit cornered. If it matters, I'm 5'8"" and she's about 5'10"" and probably heavier than me, so I should not be physically intimidating to her in any case.

My friend said that I should just email her, since we see so rarely, but it feels kinda awkward and she could just ignore it. I know that would mean 'no', but I'd like to get a clear 'no' instead. I've also thought about leaving a note at her desk, but it runs into the same problems. I would really like to ask face to face, but the opportunities are rare. I would basically need to fabricate one somehow.

We have a few company parties approaching in November and December that could open some less awkward opportunities. But I do not know if she will attend and the suspense has already been killing me for the last week. I also think she's on Tinder, so I feel I'm on the clock as it's basically pick and choose for the ladies out there. That's also a big reason I think she'll turn me down; I can't compete with the hundreds of men she's got available on Tinder. But I still need to try, I'll regret it if I don't.

I'm hyping myself up humming *heading for disaster faster than the speed of light* in my head, but I hope the disaster will be just her saying no. If I just could get even a 'no' without making her uncomfortable, and then us pretending that nothing happened, I would take it as a win.

Ladies, how would you like me to handle this, if you were the other party in this case? How to word the question or lead into it? Any ideas on how to open more opportunities or improving my chances of a 'yes'? Or is this just a lost cause?

Hello!! 

It's been a long standing dream of mine to find someone and fall in love with while knowing them! 

That dream has made me talk to many beautiful people and here I am still hunting for that one person with whom I can share my morning coffee or tea with every day which I would make to perfection every single day. 

I love cooking and feeding the people / person I love the most, sometimes the food might be spicy, but it's filled with love the tears would only be the ones due to all the happiness and never because of any troubles. 

As a big believer of working things out than chasing that new relationship feeling, I absolutely don't shy away from putting in the efforts and showing you matter to me from the get go I hope that's not something which drives you away. 

Growing up I learnt healthy relationship is not something which divdes everything 50-50 but you do your 100% for each other everyday and I am one to put my all some days that 100% might vary but, trust me I will always be giving my all what's humanly possible to me that day everyday. 

I don't come from a perfect family, but, I come from a family that deeply loves me even when I mess up at times. That love extends to you as well when you become part of the family what I ask of you on this front is to not let those stories get to you, but, try to see them as second set of family who would always be there for you on your good and bad days. And, deeply hope your family would do the same and accept me with an open heart and open arms.

Personally I'm agnostic to worship, im not even mildly spiritual however I love my meditation which is devoid of all religion or anything ritualistic, having said that I definitely love the amazing food which is made for all festivals be it the vada, payasam and pulihora on Dussehra, or the cakes during Christmas or the biryani and haleem during Ramadan. You can safely say I'm open to all religions however if you are a Hindu and one who's parents are particular about the caste system which is followed kindly note I don't fall in the GC nor the scheduled class or tribe. 

Im currently on the fluffier side of the weight where hugging me would feel like your own gaint soft toy, however I am working on the becoming a more manageable and acceptable weight person for my 5'8"" height so fitness has been on the back burner for years now and I am finally taking it seriously to make the necessary changes from a lifestyle level. Also I'm a dusky person and you can say I rival a bear (pun intended). 

Im in the core field where I work for myself (recently) and I am on the path to make a decent living off of it.

So what I am looking for is someone who's okay with the entrepreneurial journey of mine and is patient enough to see me grow instead of wanting an established me and also someone who believes in the same or similar set of things as I have mentioned above. 

I love sharing loads of memes which I find funny and they are usually silly memes and I also happen to be a big time texter so kindly ignore me if you do not like texting as much.! 

Kindly note core value alignment is very crucial to me and I unfortunately can't ignore misalignment of these core values. Which are being humble, having a live and let live attitude, being kind to others when the other person seem to be not (within agreeable limits), being okay being in close touch with a mid sized (4 people excluding me) joint family who would definitely love you and be supportive of you and your dreams. 

Kindly also note I am looking for a relationship with the end goal being marriage in a year or two maximum if for one reason or another you don't see a future where you feel this is not something which may happen with you it would be a misalignment.

We can definitely discuss our other hobbies and interests, likes and dislikes in the dms.

I have a question/request for advice.

I‚Äôve never lived in homes with wooden floor, so bear with my ignorance on the matter.
So, I moved two months ago into an apartment that has wooden floors. 
Today after coming home for work, I discovered that my cat had knocked out a cup with leftover coffee on the ground. Not much of a mess, but as I was drying the liquid I noticed the wood on the floor is not stained.
I tried everything but nothing to do: the stain is still there.

Now, the questions are:
- is it normal for a freshly renewed floor to get stained so quickly? Some other jobs in the apartment has not been done really well, so I‚Äôm curious.
- the stain is in a very annoying place and not easy to hide, do you think changing some of the wood panels would be feasible? Is it going to cost me a kidney on the black market?
- any tips to try to clean it, before I give in to desperation and debt?

I tried to talk to people and I joined this group from my same course but different languages (we study translation).
the first people I talked to were nice and seemed they had known each other from a very long time even though they met 16 days ago. then for lunch I followed them because I didn‚Äôt know what to do or where to go. Of course before I asked them if I could. Later we joined the other part of their group but I didn‚Äôt ask them for the permission to sit eating with them since I had already asked two of them.
Once I sit there I started feeling not wanted, some of them were whispering and one particular girl made fun of the situation (saying things like wtf why has she joined us?). this girl later stared at me like I was shit and talked privately we some of the boys of the group.
In particular with one and when they came back she sat between me and the rest of the group so that I was properly isolated.
she seems the kind of person who wants to be the leader and be in the centre of the attention. She seems like craving feeling pretty and loved by boys.
Before the last lesson a friend (girl) of her asked me if I wanted to get a coffee and when we went outside the room we met that girl who stared at her friend as if saying ‚Äúwhy is she here too?‚Äù.
oh and a certain point during lunch they started laughing saying to each other ‚Äúlook at the profile pic of our group‚Äù. I‚Äôm seriously scared they took a pic of mine and put it as profile pic. Im an over thinker and I hope this was just my mind but deep down I know it doesn‚Äôt.

Looking for some advice/thoughts.,"Ill start off by saying I saw this lady at the gym a few months back and thought I'll never speak to her, because she is very beautiful and i assumed she is with someone. At some point we stared at each other in the parking lot for a good 10 sec, but I was still think the same way.(im horrible at picking up any signs, if there was any) Fast forward I decided I wanted to build my confidence to start dating. I started a conversation with a different woman at the gym, but it was like talking to a wall.

One day the first lady was behind me and I turned around and said I had noticed her around and introduce myself and she does also. She starts talking about herself without me asking a question. In my mind I thought the conversation would be brushed off and i would move on, but that wasn't the case.

A few days later I run into her again as she leaves We have a short talk and I ask about her plans related to the first time we talked and i shared what I do. I wanted her to know a little about me. After that we start waving to each other while passing. Then she ended up near my workout space and I talked with her. Explained why I havent went up to her when she's working out. She said she isn't that type of person to get upset and to come up to her anytime. We talk and she shares more personal information of her tattoos and the reason they are the same, how many she has and shows me a hidden one. I cut the talk short b/c i had to get ready for work or be very late.

The following week I go up to her now and just ask about her weekend. She shares her work place and how much she made that weekend. I told her about mine. Got a little quite b/c i didnt know what to say and she mentioned dont you need to go (she was right) so I did.

A few days later I planned to ask her to hang out. (I have never been able to say go on a date I need to work on that.) I got nervous because I knew where she would be so I took a different path in the morning.  Lucky for me at that time I was leaving after washing up, she passed by as I exited the locker room. I called out to her and we walked out together. I mentioned I had to grab my keys from the front desk. Not thinking about it, but when I turned back around she was still standing there waiting. At that point I decided to ask her. We walked to her car and I asked if she would like to hang out. She said 'im busy, but when im free I'll let you know.' I said ok, she seemed confused by me asking her.  Then I notice her legs caving in and her body lean forward a bit. She seemed to be thinking about it. I did not say anything i just waited. Then she says again 'im busy.'  I started to leave after that, but as I was leaving I said when your free we can get coffee and take a walk by the river. 

A week later I see her at the gym. It looked like she was avoiding me now no eye contact anymore and quickly moveing pass my workout space. I didnt go up to her because I thought I should give her space and time. A week pass, and today. I see her again and walk to her space and ask how she's been. Now im getting short answers and I noticed it. I excuse myself and went back to my workout.

I reflected on all this before and noticed she didnt really give signs of interested in me. Most likely I became a gym friend, which is ok. I did think I would have more then one interaction with her. My question is why would someone share so much detail about themselves and then go cold after I had shown interest?",1,1759949564.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1o1jcin,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1o1jcin/can_aqua_crest_aqucf08a_filter_replacement/,Can AQUA CREST AQU-CF08A Filter Replacement Deliver Cleaner Water? In-Depth Review,"The AQUA CREST AQU-CF08A filter replacement is engineered for faucet filtration systems, targeting households aiming for healthier, better-tasting water. I‚Äôve been using this filter regularly in place of my usual PUR RF-9999 filters, and it delivers on many fronts‚Äîthough there are a few nuances worth addressing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
What strikes me first is its compact and lightweight design; it fits snugly into my faucet filtration unit without any hassle. The blue exterior is easy on the eyes, and the unit feels sturdy despite its relatively lightweight at 0.51 pounds. Its NSF certification for lead-free material is reassuring, as I don‚Äôt have to worry about the filter adding unwanted elements into the water. One thing to note is that the included user manual is quite helpful in explaining how to attach and maintain the unit.

**Ease of Installation and Setup**  
Setting up this replacement filter was simpler than I expected. After soaking it in clean tap water for three minutes, as recommended, the installation was straightforward. No tools or additional components were required, which is a major plus for someone like me who isn‚Äôt exactly a DIY enthusiast. The process felt seamless, though replacing it every three months might feel a bit frequent depending on your household‚Äôs water usage. 

[Grab AQUA CREST AQU-CF08A at the best price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01bsgm7ku/)

**Performance and Filtration Efficiency**  
Using natural coconut-activated carbon blocks, this filter claims to remove up to 97.2% of chlorine. In practice, I noticed a noticeable improvement in water taste and odor. My morning coffee even tastes better, thanks to the reduced chlorine and sediment. Additionally, the filter successfully tackles sediment and rust, but it‚Äôs essential to know it doesn‚Äôt lower Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), as noted on the packaging. The absence of TDS filtration is acceptable for me because my main concern is eliminating chlorine and other immediate impurities.

**Compatibility with Multiple Models**  
This filter replacement impressed me with its wide compatibility. It works with most PUR faucet filtration systems, including models like FM-3700, FM-3400B, and FM-9000B. Testing it on different faucets at home proved just how versatile this product is. Whether it‚Äôs the simple kitchen setup or an advanced horizontal mount in the wet bar, it performed consistently.

**Winning Points**  
- NSF-Certified for chlorine reduction and lead-free material.  
- Simple and quick installation process.  
- Enhanced water taste and smell, perfect for drinking and cooking needs.

**Critiques**  
- Doesn‚Äôt reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS).  
- Requires replacement every three months, which may feel frequent for high-consumption households.  

**Direct Competitors**  
Comparing this product to its competitors, such as the PUR RF-9999 filter, the AQUA CREST replacement holds its ground rather well. While both models focus on chlorine removal and sediment reduction, the AQUA CREST‚Äôs affordability makes it a more cost-effective option. On the downside, the PUR RF-9999 does offer slightly better longevity, not needing a replacement as soon as three months. Another alternative is Brita faucet filters, but they‚Äôre often pricier without a clear advantage in filtration effectiveness, at least in my own experience.

**Smart Spending**  
From a cost perspective, the price-to-quality ratio of the AQUA CREST AQU-CF08A is difficult to beat. While it doesn‚Äôt include advanced features like TDS reduction, the key functionalities it does offer are solid. If you‚Äôre budget-conscious but still want to improve your home‚Äôs drinking water quality without stepping into overkill territory, this filter strikes an excellent balance.

It‚Äôs taken me almost 2 months to gather the courage to share this. This is about Coffee, an old indie boy, around 10 years old, who has no one ‚Äî no home, no family ‚Äî just a tired body and a gentle heart that still wags its tail when he sees love.

I first met Coffee when he was 7. He was a little weak but full of spirit. For the next 1.5 years, I took care of him ‚Äî food, medicines, deworming, everything. He became like family. Although he came from somewhere outside my university.

After I left university, I asked a few people to keep an eye on him ‚Äî just a bowl of water and two meals a day. But one night, I got a call. Coffee had collapsed. They sent me a photo ‚Äî he was lying down, unable to stand. My heart sank.

I immediately arranged an ambulance and got him admitted to a shelter. Thankfully, he recovered after a few days. But when I saw him, it broke me. He looked malnourished and dehydrated, like he hadn‚Äôt had proper food or water for ages at the University. This was his third major injury.

That‚Äôs when I realized Coffee was getting old. Those hard calluses on his joints said it all. Age and pain had slowly taken his life. 

I requested to keep Coffee for a few days, as the shelter was safer for him at that time. Still, within days, his condition started worsening again. Even there, I couldn‚Äôt provide as much care as I would have liked.

By God‚Äôs grace, I finally found a good boarding place. I visited, and everything seemed perfect. In August, I moved Coffee there ‚Äî a large, loving place with caring volunteers. Boarding charges are Rs 5000/month, with vet visits separate.

Coffee has had two vet visits, revealing lumps and osteoarthritis. Each visit costs around Rs 4000, totaling Rs 8000. I managed to cover these costs, but I can‚Äôt do everything alone.

It‚Äôs sometimes emotionally draining, but what‚Äôs the point of being an animal lover if I can‚Äôt help Coffee in his final years? He still needs medicines, care, and love. The volunteers at Paws & Pause genuinely care for him, and their purpose shines through in their actions.

If anyone wants to support Coffee ‚Äî please DM me. A group has been created to maintain transparency and post updates by them.  For those who prefer not to join, I‚Äôve made a separate group. Updates will be posted once daily at night by me, as I don't wanna spam the whole day. And disappearing messages feature can be used to save storage. 

Any monthly contributions are most welcome, it will gonna help coffee. Will share their details directly for help.

Coffee may be old, fragile, and expensive to care for, but he deserves every bit of comfort, love, and dignity in these years.

1o1j62n,https://www.reddit.com/r/plassing/comments/1o1j62n/early_morning_donations_advice/,Early morning donations advice,"I have been donating twice a week for about a year, with a little hiatus somewhere in there for a few months. I've never had issues during or after donating , the only side effect being some fatigue by the end of the week. The last few months I have changed my donation time to super early, right when they open. This means I'm waking up earlier than normal, which isn't great for my appetite and it's hard to eat a substantial amount, but I'm able to eat a protein bar and a banana (about 300 cal) about 1.5 hour prior to donating. I try to drink as much  water as possible in the morning, but it's tough being that I'm up and out of the house in about 45 minutes, a good chunk of which I am getting my animals situated before I leave. It's another 40 min drive to the donation center. So basically, up at 4:30, eat by 4:50-5, leave by 5:15ish, donate by 6:15-6:30.

Last Saturday, I wasn't thinking (crazy morning at home) and chugged some coffee, which I never do. I put low fat milk and collagen powder (12g protein) in my coffee, no sugar (stevia) so I thought I would be fine, as I had my snack right after. Right at the end of my donation, my heart started to POUND, just beating so hard and fast. I've never had this happen before, and it didn't resolve right away. They had me evaluated by a nurse, but my vitals were fine and my heart had calmed down. We chalked it up to the caffeine and left it at that, no defferal or anything.

So this morning, I had a very small of amount of coffee, followed by the usual snack. During donation, nearly right as soon as I started getting my blood back, my heart started to pound/race again. This time I tried breathing exercises which helped some, and I started feeling better when the donation begins again. It didn't start to POUND like earlier on the next return but my pulse was definitely quickened. It gave me a lot of anxiety in anticipation of a complication, and I did breathing exercises the remainder of the donation but it wasn't pleasant. 

So now I'm having anxiety about this being a possible reaction to the citrate?  But I'm also considering it's related to the caffeiene? It's probably compounded with the drop in BP and fast hemodynamics we're asking our bodies to keep up with, which I understand (I have a medical background).

Should I not drink ANY coffee prior to donating and just hydrate hydrate hydrate? I have been having a lot of stress/anxiety in my life and not sleeping great, so I worry about driving so early without caffeine, but with how uncomfortable the heart racing is during donations, this is a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

I'm going to try going low-caf in general so I hope that helps everything (including my generalized anxiety), but I know that takes time and I get terrible caffeine withdrawal headaches.

Anyways just looking for someone to pat me on the back and tell me it's going to be FINE next time I donate, just law off the coffee, lol.",3,1759949021.0,plassing,3,1.0,False
1o1j53n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1o1j53n/i_feel_trapped_and_going_insane/,I feel trapped and going insane,"Ever since Mom got placed in hospice at our house she has been making it a living hell. since she's been misbehaving so much by CONSTANTLY trying to get up and walk on her own (which she can't do on her own safely). There's multiple reasons she gives when she wants to try and get up on her own.

She usually imagines something like trying to find some imaginary dog she thinks she sees, pick up some glass that isn't there. Basically nonsensical reasons probably because of her Parkinson's has progressed to the point where she can't swallow anymore so she needs a feeding tube in her to give her all her nutrients and water.

But that doesn't stop her from trying to make coffee or try and grab something from the kitchen, so we keep having to remind her over and over again she can't eat or drink anymore and she acts like a child saying ""Nuh uh"" and claiming she had a sandwich or pepsi just yesterday while no one was here and if you try to say otherwise ""Yes I did!"" all while treating me like a bad guy for ""starving"" her.

It's gotten SO bad that someone has to stay in the room with her during the day because otherwise she'll CONSTANTLY try to get up for some stupid reason ignoring the fact that she can't walk or that she's still hooked up to a machine that pumps nutrients in her. 

I even gave her the benefit of the doubt one time and let her just in the wheel chair because she claimed that's all she wanted and what does she do? She immediately starts trying to book it to the kitchen even desperately trying to push herself with her feet while I'm stopping her.

It's even gotten so bad that today while my Dad was still in the room and I was preparing to stay with her in the room for a bit by transferring my laptop to the couch, she got up again real fast and tried get her suit case because she thinks she's in any shape to go to the wedding in another country in December.

Because someone has to watch her all the time and it's just me and my Dad, I feel like I'm just stuck at the house now because of it, so I can't go out and do anything for too long. Which is also problem because I want to try and get some kind of health insurance because it's been so long since I had a check up and all the llittle things are kinda scaring me of could be could not be bad.",2,1759948960.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

We‚Äôre a late 20's couple from Canada and will be coming to Japan straight after a trip to Vietnam! My partner is vegetarian and I eat everything.

* Open questions:
* Hakone, Koyasan, or Amami after Kyoto
* Kyoto Halloween recommendations?
* Best day in my itinerary to bike - arashiyama or philosopher's path?
* **Day 1 Land, Osaka -> Kyoto - Wed Oct 29**
   * 2pm - HAN to KIX, send luggage to Kyoto hotel
   * 4pm - Get to Osaka. Dotonbori and Namba
   * Dinner in Osaka, then late check-in to Kyoto hotel in Gion
* **Day 2 Kyoto - Uji/Fushimi Inari (since some matcha shops are closed weekends?) - Thurs Oct 30**
   * Morning in Uji, maybe brunch. Shop for matcha. Matcha workshop at Chazuna 1pm. Byodo-In Temple / Omotesando.
   * Fushimi Inari, hike up for sunset.
* **Day 3 Kyoto - Philosopher's Path - Fri Oct 31**
   * Is this a good day to rent a bike?
   * Wife + Husband cafe picnic 1030am
   * If bike, go up Kamo River to demachiyanagi
   * Walk or bike philosopher's path from Hachi Shrine to nanzenji
   * Fushimi Inari if we didn't go yesterday. If we did, dinner and a bar like Beatle momo or hachi
   * OR find something spooky, like the Yokai festival at Toei Studio Park for Halloween.
* **Day 4 Kyoto - Kiyomizudera - Sat Nov 1**
   * Early Kiyomizudera, ninenzeka, yasaka-dori
   * Lunch at takinoya
   * Hanamikoji St
   * Chill evening or do something we missed
* **Day 5 Kyoto - Arashiyama + Kinkaku-ji (busy day, maybe offload some to Day 4) - Sun Nov 2**
   * Might offload some to Day 4 eg Kinkakuji. Was thinking of biking this day originally but read that Arashiyama might be too busy.
   * Forward luggage to Tokyo hotel
   * Skip the regular forest for at Adashino
   * Gioji, Adashino and Otagi Nenbutsuji temples
   * Okachi Sanso garden
   * Tenryu-ji temple and shigetsu for lunch, or shoraian
   * Time/energy pending, taxi/uber to Kinkaku-ji before 5pm
   * Pontocho Alley evening

The following is not Kyoto but could appreciate some advice:

* **Day 6 - Ryokan or Temple in Koyasan, Amami, or Hakone - Mon Nov 3 Culture Day**
   * The original plan was to stay at a¬†**ryokan in Hakone**¬†with a private onsen since we have tattoos, as a good midpoint in our trip and a nice recharging anniversary evening. While there‚Äôs lots to do, it seems like a copy and paste experience and I‚Äôve seen that it can get busy. I‚Äôm also second guessing the ryokan I‚Äôve booked based on reviews (Mikawaya Ryokan).
   * **A temple at Koyasan**¬†looked promising since we need a vegetarian meal. I'm into the authentic and spiritual vibe of Koyasan but I fear it may not be the most healing physically, especially if we're waking up early for the morning prayer and has no onsen, just a bathhouse.
   * The third option is¬†**Nanten-en Inn in Amami**¬†which has veg, and can plan a walk, bike, or hike in the town. It's also closer than Koyasan.
* **Day 7-12 Tokyo**

Some things we would like to do are visit nice neighbourhoods, go for coffee/matchas, shopping (thrift/vintage, crafts, denim, list goes on), bars, (eg hifi/record bars), go for bike rides/hikes, concerts, flea markets. I've left some evenings free mainly free to either rest, go for dinner or bars nearby, wander, etc.

I'm also looking to go to a Ryokan / temple (because vegetarian) for our anniversary. I‚Äôm pretty stumped on this one and it‚Äôs a big question mark in my itinerary.",1,1759948939.0,KyotoTravel,0,1.0,False

1o1j3vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lifepluscindy_snark/comments/1o1j3vh/is_she_purposely_setting_herself_up_to_fail/,Is she purposely setting herself up to fail?,"I am wondering if Cindy's new approach to food has zero to do with actually working through anything in therapy to better her relationship with food & her health but is rather one of three things, possibly a combination of all of them*

Option 1: she's come up with this new approach to food to use as an excuse to allow herself to be more flexible & fun for the time Ted is home. She wants to do & be everything she thinks he wants her to be & part of that ""pick me, party girl, look-at-me-I'm fun"" attitude is for her to eat & drink all the things the way Ted wants to. So I'm wondering if she's concocted this plan to give herself permission to eat differently for the next 3 months while Ted is home to show him she's able to keep up with him & make him happy while still giving herself permission to fail & go back to carnivore... cuz she's absolutely setting herself up for failure with the way she's doing this. 

Option 2: this new approach may still be to make her more appealing to Ted in some ways but may also be as a way of justifying having to go back to carnivore when she inevitably loses it, melts down, & goes back to a full on restrictive diet like she always does. She said she's given herself 3 months to try this way of eating knowing she can always fall back into the safety net of carnivore if it doesn't work out. That outlook didn't come from a therapist. That's not the way a therapist would express things. A therapist would have given her an actual plan to follow. But Cindy very clearly said she herself came up with this approach in the vlog when she announced what she was going to be doing. So I'm wondering if this is all being done with the ultimate goal being that she tried but has no choice but to fall back into her old ways & give into restriction & an unhealthy relationship with food.

Option 3: it's purely for views because she thinks she has no other material that will draw people to watch & she's willing to take that chance because at least she'll be doing fun things like eating/drinking the way Ted likes to do in the process & she can just go back to carnivore when the inevitable happens. But at least for now she'll have content that's more than daily hikes & coffee tasting

*ETA: [Please don't misunderstand me, I'm not trying to belittle or make fun of her very real need for help with her relationship with food. It's absolutely something she needs help to work through with a therapist who is well versed in treating ED, addiction, & BPD but it's just that this is Cindy & we've been here before & know exactly what's going to happen so I have very little sympathy for her anymore. I don't believe a word she says. I don't believe she's working on this with her therapist or that she's doing this in a healthy way. She's in the middle of a BPD episode even though she doesn't realize it & that would hopefully have been recognized by her therapist if she were truly doing the work to heal. Instead she claims she's healed, except for her relationship with food, & makes light of how easy this will be knowing she can just drop back into carnivore if it gets too tough. She's just once again weaponizing & monetizing her mental health for engagement & it's not OK] ",14,1759948886.0,Lifepluscindy_snark,3,1.0,False

Blue is for Saran while Purple is for Poly. The pastel blue and purple colors are the alleged hair types of unreleased dolls which are subject to change upon release. By Batch means these dolls have a variant with saran hair depending on the time they were produced. So for example, a few dolls, like Core Clawdeen, originally released with poly have come back with saran hair. Purple is for the couple of dolls that have a mix of poly and saran hair. Other hair types include molded on hair and Venus' hair which is assumed to be acrylic yarn. As an extra note, all Buried Secrets Wave 3 dolls have poly hair even though they don't have pictures (Twyla, Cleo, Lagoona).

If you are curious on the differences between different hair types, check out the replies in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHigh/s/8zAe1jdpu9) which give wonderful explanations!

But on my own I've gotten into Indie, soul, funk, and different alternative artists. One artist in particular that I LOVE is ethel cain, I am absolutely obsessed. Her voice is hauntingly beautiful, and she has so many demos so even when you think you've heard it all you end up finding a ton of unreleased, perfect songs. I also really, reallyyyyyyy enjoy writing. Not sure if I'm actually any good at it but it brings me comfort and is one of the few hobbies I haven't given up on. I'm also very interested in psychology, I think for college I'd like to major in it and minor in criminal law to become a forensic psychologist bc I'm very into true crime as well. I love to do personal studies on rare mental illnesses and document my findings; I think it'll be interesting to compare current information we have on them with future research that is done as more is known about the illnesses. I do enjoy journaling as well and I study art in school, mainly 3D, ceramics specifically. Last few little things I enjoy is driving, going for walks, I love love love coffee !!

If you think I'm cute, lets connect."" as a way to engage with women in public. As we all know that dating apps suck so I decided to basically abandon them and make my move in person more. I've seen multiple videos of women making these cards and giving it out to guys and I've also seen in person where women have given them out at social events so I decided to give it a try.

The card basically has the cute message and then my contact info (insta and phone) with some facts about me like my profession, my star signs, age, ethnicity etc but nothing to like my salary or height.

Last week I decided to test them out and to my surprise, a few did respond to me. I was at a singles mixer and I saw a few girls here and there and I interacted with them. Some I directly approached before handing the card, some I gave the card and they approached me. At the end one girl did try to follow/connect with me on insta with the card I gave her.

I also was at a coffee shop once where I had to quickly leave and saw this one girl writing in her journal so I decided to go up to her, compliment her and gave her the card. No response but not surprised.

Ladies, is this weird or not? Because I've been reading mixed reviews.

Reader Discretion Advised: The following contains details on death of children

The sun began to rise through the clear sky. Beautiful colors of yellow, orange, pink, and red all danced to the silhouette of the rising star. I got a wave of warmth and happiness that I hadn‚Äôt felt in some time. I would even go so far as to say: it felt euphoric. I could have enjoyed the day longer, but I had too many things to do. I put on my headphones and began to dance as the song ‚ÄúPrisencolinensinainciusol‚Äù by Adriano Celentano began.  

I started by first dragging the lifeless body of the father. At least I believed it was the father. I mean, if my memory is correct, the clothes he was wearing was the same the current body was in. It was truly hard to tell when his head was nearly halfway gone and splattered all alone the floor and wall where his body lay. Outside of the clothes, since he was right near the front door where I laid my shotgun after shooting him, logic made me assume it was him. With his head nearly gone, the body was left slack and heavy where it laid. So dragged his body to the living room, blood trail following right behind. Propping him up against the couch, I struggled a little to get him up and sat on the couch on my left hand side.  

Next, the headless wife I left in the kitchen. Her head near the body, still looking as shocked she was when I struck her with the axe. She was easier to carry; it was putting her head on top of her body that was hardest. I sat her on the right side of the couch and had to stick a kitchen knife between her body and head to make the head stick. Like I said, tougher than I expect.   

I then pranced over to what I can assume was the kid‚Äôs bedroom. The song, now on its 10th repeat, made my body prance towards the kids‚Äô room as I sang along to the gibberish lyrics. I opened the door and made my way to the teenager that lay on the floor, bloody from the canyon made from the axe that ran across her now decrepit face. She was very easy to just throw over my shoulders. Moving my hips as I walked out the door, a thump suddenly caught my attention. I dropped the teens body down and moved my headphones away from my head the song still blasting away as I listened intently. I slowly made my way to where I thought the thump came from. The bathroom near another room where I didn‚Äôt find anyone initially. I opened the door quietly, except for the blasting music coming from my headphones. I heard another bump, this time, coming from in the cabinet under the bathroom sink. I turned slowly and opened it. It was a boy, young and scared. His body displaying his breathing in deep distress and I could even swear I saw his heart pounding out of his chest. It was quite the site, but nonetheless, I smiled and quickly grabbed the boy who began to scream bloody murder.  

It took me a little bit longer to set the scene exactly how it should be. The mom and dad now in the middle, with one kid on other side. The little boy, who had been hiding under the cabinet, was very easy to prepare. Just a swift insertion of a steak knife where his heart was; quick and painless for him. Such pity I couldn‚Äôt make him suffer like the rest of the family, but time was of the essence. After I was done setting the family up on the couch, I put my usual note on the table. ‚ÄúThe End is Only Shelter‚Äù the note read. I then took a picture with a polaroid camera and left the photo on the table near the note. Such a beautiful piece.  

Afterwards, I went out to my car, pulled out my backpack from the trunk. The outside, a beautiful sunny morning, with not a soul nearby. I suppose that is the downside to living so far out from civilization. After admiring the morning for a minute, I went back inside and made a cup of coffee. While the coffee was brewing, I went to the bathroom and took a hot shower. I placed my clothes, mask and gloves into a plastic bag which I then placed into my backpack. Putting on plastic gloves, I then brushed my teeth, combed my hair and made my way to the kitchen. The coffee was ready and smelt like heaven. I looked in the cabinets and found one travel mug that I then proceeded to fill up with the coffee. I then put the headphones back on, the song still playing. I then took one last look at my current masterpiece, retrieved the polaroid off the table, appreciated my work, and walked out the door.  

¬†
I put the backpack in the trunk of my car, turned off the music, and was about to enter the driver side when I suddenly heard screaming in the distance. I could barely make out who the person was that was running to me, but I could hear the man shouting my name: ‚ÄúGABRIEL!‚Äù. He shouted in my direction, running like a fool. Annoyed by his intrusion, I got into my car, slammed the door, and drove away. ",2,1759948405.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1o1iryj,https://i.redd.it/8lt9dmshlxtf1.jpeg,Tyler‚Äôs character inspiration,"That is an excerpt from¬†**Chas Addams: A Cartoonist's Life**, the biography of the creator of the Addams cartoons, and by extension, the Addams Family.¬†

Charles Addams was an avid reader who explored all kinds of genres, from the classics to the contemporary. He was also a meticulous man who loved documenting everything in his diary, including the books he read. In¬†**A Cartoonist's Life**, his biographer Linda H. Davis highlights a particular diary entry to show that Chas Addams was a complex, multi-faceted man, one whose interests went far beyond the grotesque and macabre he was best known for.

**He read. ""Unlike many cartoonists,"" commented Chip McGrath, ""Charles Addams actually read the magazine."" He liked humor writer Veronica Geng; he knew historical trivia. He apparently read an Anne Tyler novel. (""Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant ‚ÄîTyler,"" he wrote in his 1982 datebook.)**

To summarise briefly,¬†**Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant** by Anne Tyler explores the effects of parental neglect and dysfunctional family relationships. It follows three children abandoned by their father and estranged from their emotionally distant mother‚Äîeach developing distinct temperaments shaped by that trauma. Cody, the eldest son, struggles most with anger, self-doubt, and resentment.

I've always felt that the Wednesday series was a love letter to Charles Addams. It has a certain quality that sets it apart from other adaptations, likely because it weaves inspiration from the creator's personal life and the mythologies surrounding him. If Chas Addams were alive today, I believe this series would appeal deeply to his sensibilities beyond the cartoons themselves.

Based on clues from Charles Addams's biography and Brendan Gill's 1975¬†New Yorker¬†profile, I think Tyler's character in Wednesday was written to reflect another side of Addams‚Äîhis personality, his experiences, even fragments of his relationships. Tyler's moments with Wednesday mirror moments from Addams's own life:

1. **The Weathervane Cafe**  - Charles began drawing cartoons for his school's literary magazine,¬†The Weather Vane, at sixteen, where he served as art director. Later, when he became a household name at¬†The New Yorker, he was a regular at an elite social club in New York called¬†**The Coffee House**. In Wednesday, 16-year-old Tyler Galpin works as a barista at the Weathervane, a coffeehouse where Wednesday often spends her time.

2. **The Crypt Date** - Charles Addams often went on picnic dates with his third wife, Tee, in cemeteries.

**The couple picnicked in cemeteries and enjoyed the dogs. -*from A Cartoonist's Life, page 302**

3.¬†**Legally Blonde** -¬†Of all the rom-coms Tyler could've picked to watch as a ""horror movie"" with Wednesday, Legally Blonde feels deliberate. The story of Elle Woods strikingly resembles Charles Addams's second wife, Barbara Barb.

Descriptions of Barbara from the book:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†""People were astonished to learn that this woman with the movie-star hair, tiny waist, and long black gloves was a practicing lawyer. Poured into a tight skirt and an expensive, low-cut blouse with French cuffs, Barbara Barb suggested Hollywood's idea of a woman lawyer.""
‚Ä¢	‚Å†""Specializing in international law ‚Äîan unusual choice for private practice in those days, noted Nancy Wechsler.""
‚Ä¢	‚Å†""When she wasn't jetting off to Europe on business, she spent her time swimming, riding, playing tennis, drawing skillful courtroom sketches she called ""legal satire,"" and writing a prospective book titled ""Murder In Law,"" an apparent reference to her own youthful victories in the criminal courts.""
‚Ä¢	‚Å†""After graduation she set up a solo practice at 675 Gates Avenue in Brooklyn at her mothers residence, where she had grown up.""
‚Ä¢	‚Å†""Spooky, that woman,"" was Lyda Hall's terse assessment of the new Barbara. If Addams heard any of this chatter from the flock of pretty girls Barbara posed with on his porch at Westhampton Beach ‚Äîall smiles and summer shorts ‚Äîit seemed to have no effect on him. He was utterly captivated. ""Charlie just absolutely adored her,"" said Therese Milstein.""
‚Ä¢	‚Å†""Charles Addams is now mixed up with a woman lawyer who bites him and is said to be handy with a knife when she's mad,"" James Thurber wrote his daughter, Rosemary, on October 4, 1954.""
‚Ä¢	‚Å†""It was noted that ""the glamorous barrister"" would ""continue to represent her ex-husband, cartoonist Charles Addams.""

1.	‚Å†**Willow Hill**¬†- Charles was once admitted to Lenox Hill Hospital; he married Tee on a hill where a willow tree stood.

**Barbara had found a doctor and arranged for him to meet Charlie at Lenox Hill Hospital. -from page 298**

**It stood on the Burdett's Creek side of the house, where they had been married, and where there was a willow tree. -from page 264**

---

**Possible reasons why Tyler is a Hyde**


1.	‚Å†During World War II, Charles was drafted and worked at Army's Signal Corps Photographic Center (SCPC).


**Addams was assigned to Unit A, which included several World War I artists, paid as civilians. Among the regular soldiers were Clarence John Laughlin, a well-known New Orleans photographer who became a good friend; Gerry Davis, who later produced The Odd Couple on tele vision; the boyish Stan Lee, who would become a writer and co-creator of The Amazing Spider-Man^ The Incredible Hulk, and other Marvel Comics superheroes -¬†from page 72**


The SCPC was located in the old Paramount studio at Thirty-fifth Avenue and Thirty-fifth Street in Astoria.

**Here the Marx Brothers had filmed Animal Crackers and The Cocoanuts; John Barrymore had starred in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. -*from page 71**

2.¬†**‚Äùthe monster that is in all of us.""** Of all the mythological figures Charles Addams drew, his favourite was the Minotaur‚Äîa creature symbolising duality, punished simply for existing as both man and beast, for possessing a nature beyond his control.

**""semibovemque virum semivirumque bovem""¬†(""Half-bull man and half-man bull""), a line describing the Minotaur from Ovid's¬†Ars Armatoria)**

Seneca, Phaedra 687 ff :

**‚ÄùThy monster-bearing mother [Pasiphae] . . . She did but pollute herself with her shameful lust, and yet her offspring by its two-shaped infamy [the Minotaur] displayed her crime, though long concealed, and by his fierce visage the hybrid child made clear his mother's guilt.""**

Addams was asked about his some what ""romantic, nostalgic"" takes on such mythological figures as the Minotaur in the labyrinth. Addams drew the Minotaur not as the fear some creature of mythology, drawn on a shattered cliffby Gustave Dore, but as a two-legged beast leaning dreamily against the wall of a modern art gallery or a rat's maze, or lurking in an information booth, his face more reflective than menacing. ""Well, I find him sweet and human and the way everyone wants his own particular Minotaur to be,"" Addams told Philip French. In the Minotaur, he found ""the monster that is in all of us."" - from page 153

In **Season 2, Episode 5**, during the Outcast Remembrance Day parade, a float carries two ancient Outcasts, the Cyclops and the Minotaur, through a sea of cloaked figures. Then Tyler steps in, hidden beneath the same robes.

Barbara Barb (the second wife) had peculiar pet names for Addams, including ""Dearest Porker Bell"", ""Porker"", and ""My Monstre"".

**Writing in her typical motherly style, Barbara urged Addams to take care of himself and watch his drinking. While claiming to rejoice in his happiness as a popular bachelor, she missed him, she said. He was still her ""Porker Bell,"" her ""Zoe Porker""; she was still his ""Monstre."" -from page 146**

3. During his lifetime, fans and critics spread rumours that Charles Addams suffered mental breakdowns whenever he created his most famous works, so severe that¬†The New Yorker¬†supposedly called an ambulance to take him to a sanitarium.

**""I used to hear it as an estabUshed fact from members of the cult, none of whom had ever met Charlie, that whenever he reached the point of derangement at which he began to sketch again one of the most famous of his drawings ‚Äî that of a skier who has just skied through the trunk of a tree, the tracks of his skis uninterrupted on either side of the trunk and the skier himself miraculously intact ‚Äî the office would summon an ambulance and have Charlie hurried off to a sanitarium."" Brendan Gill,¬†Here at the New Yorker (1975), page 222**

""They said that Addams would have periodic mental breakdowns and begin drawing the gruesome maternity room cartoon."" Linda H. Davis, Chas Addams: A Cartoonist's Life, page 3


---

The following is a prediction/speculation for season 3:

I suspect Wednesday's obsession with murder mysteries and sleuthing stems from two influences:

1.	‚Å†Edgar Allan Poe invented the modern detective story, and
2.	‚Å†During the Great Depression, Charles Addams worked as a part-timer at True Detective around the same time Bonnie and Clyde started their two-year crime spree (1932-1934) involving bank robberies, gas station heists, and auto theft across several states.

**Hired at $15 a week, ""terrible"" money even during ""the nadir of the Depression,"" said Addams, he did lettering, diagrammed crime scenes re-creating ""how the murderer moved about the room,"" drew ""the X where the body was found,"" and painted the blood out of some of the grislier police shots that ran with the stories - an exercise that might be compared to blotting stains from a suit of clothes with benzene. It re quired skill rather than talent. Addams personally liked the pictures the way they were, ""with just a tad more blood and gore,"" he said. - from page 38**

**It was the era captured in a flashbulb. Here were the glory days ofor ganized crime and mythical figures such as Al ""Scarface"" Capone and Lucky Luciano. Sinister figures in pearl-gray homburgs cruised the city streets in big Packards.¬†Bonnie and Clyde, John Dillinger and his gang, tore around the dirt roads of the Midwest, robbing banks and bumping offanyone who got in their way. -from page 39**

**""We're two black-hearted souls ready to pillage the world together.""** I have reasons to believe this is foreshadowing. Tyler used the word ""pillage"".

Pillage (noun):

to steal something from a place or a person by using violence, especially during war.
from Cambridge Dictionary

1: the act of looting or plundering especially in war
2: something taken as booty
from Merriam-Webster Dictionary

Very much like my old job, but only I sort out more of a financial side of things, so its been a bit new switching to this. Today I had my first supervision with my line manager and safe to say it didn't go well. I was basically called useless and to quote his words ""it was shit"" and ""you couldn't even serve tea.""

Now, bit of background. Was volunteering at the eikon centre. I was looking after tea and coffee. The Teachers were serving themselves tea and coffee, whilst I did what I was asked, topping up the coffee and biscuits. Inbetween this i was sitting down as I have severe back pain. I self referred myself to physio about 6 months ago and recently this has gotten worse. Supposedly the volunteer coordinator there was basically saying why would you bring someone here that can hardly work. Baring in mind, despite the pain, I was still doing what I was asked. She wasnt about most of the time to see this. But hey ho, according to my line manager, it seems im a shit worker. (From what I gathered through convo tbh) 

Im not sure how to go about this. Ive had many supervisions and ive never been spoken to like that ever, even by my last two bosses.  It's left me feeling unmotivated and genuinely that I dont want to work for a company that let's their managers speak to employees like this. I am a hard worker, and try my best. Unfortunately I do have days i struggle with my back and can hardly walk, but i crack on cause what else am I supposed to do? Manager said he cant put any reasonable adjustments and hes waiting on me getting into physio which god knows when. Can a doctors note sub to this? I also don't know how he'd make any considering I bounce around 3 offices in the 3 days I work.

But he's fucking annoying. He dosent listen. I miss being able to be a girl and go get a coffee, do pilates and come home and watch sex and the city and think about boys. Now I'm overweight, overwhelmed and over stimulated. Having a child was a mistake I think. Im hoping he grows out of it I love him but I hate the toddler phase. Im also a single mom, fuck this sucks :(

I can't even go to the fucking grocery store without him fucking screaming and crying. I just want to yell at him to shut the fuck up or fucking smack him, I won't do those things but its just how I feel, I went to the er today and got anti-depressants but it won't be ready for a couple of days.

What do I do? I don't have the balls for adoption but I'm tired my back hurts my body hurts I'm crying as I type this because I love him so much, but I have never been more miserable in my life.

# Training

This was my fourth marathon, first time going sub-3 which was my main goal. The last marathon I ran was 4 years ago in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in 2021 I got a 3:11 and came in 3rd.

Previously I followed Hal‚Äôs plan and read the book. This time I felt I had a basic idea of what needed to be done. My training was simple, something I found somewhere [Dale Magnin‚Äôs little powerpoint ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NVkbRjWpoHKNzJIx3yH-D-p8Qj7P4Gdx/view?usp=sharing)that says that every week you should have long run, mile repeats, tempo run and easy run.¬†

My base started around 20 mpw during April and the increase was very gradual. Took 10 days off in July when I thought I got injured (turns out I just needed new shoes). My mileage peaked at 60 mpw In August I ran 150, and in September 187 miles. I had quite a few weeks around 35-40. I live in Madrid, and so it was really hot over the summer and my runs were mostly early morning or evening. In September I moved closer to the city center and I started to run at the park El Retiro, where lots of runners coalesce in the evenings. I fell in love with evening runs there, and especially loved running fast! I started to do what I called Mortal Kombat Miles, finishing my mile repeat workouts with a mile where I ran very fast (5:35-5:40 miles) listening to the Mortal Kombat Theme Song on repeat and racing through the park.¬†Exhilirating and beautiful, I kept those images of the running with thousands of people in Madrid in the early evening to Mortal Kombat with me to remind me of the beauty of running.

In August I spent 10 days living with my German family in Berlin where I went on lovely long runs throughout Zehlendorf and Gruenewald (lots of soft ground, shady forest, lakes), followed by big family meals.

Things I did different this time from before: ran 4 long runs of 20 miles. They really killed me and made me doubt if I‚Äôd be able to keep up a sub-3 pace during the race, but I just liked to know that I had done them.

No track workouts, just mile repeats.

Consistent with calisthenics workouts (push ups, pull ups, dips, squats, lunges) and continued to do this 2x a week until that last taper weeks. I don‚Äôt know how much it has to with marathon training I like to hang out at the pull-up bars at the park and talk to boys. Either way I don‚Äôt think it hurt.

Very focused on nutrition during the last 2 months especially, upped protein intake and during the taper I made sure I was giving my body lots of rice and meat and everything it needed, even though I was running out of money.

I visualized crossing the finish line at 2:59 at the end of many of my runs. I read Marukami‚Äôs What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, and enjoyed it immensely.

**Pre-race**

I started to doubt myself and prepared myself to get a 3:08. I did a 5k at marathon pace on Friday and was like wow how am I going to do this for the marathon! I lowered the expectations I had for myself because I felt I didn't have a strict enough training plan and I started to read too much reddit!

Got to Cologne and had to resist eating everything (I love German bakeries), slept well the Friday and Saturday night. The 10:30 AM start was amazing, no feeling of being rushed and had time to digest food properly. 3 pieces of toast for breakfast (blackberry, strawberry jam, nutella) and 2 cups of coffee and I was ready to go.¬†¬†

My friends and parents were there which was beautiful and I felt very supported/loved.

The crowed carried me without a doubt, the energy fed me and I burned that fuel into miles. I started behind the 3:30 pacer because I took a while to get to the block so I felt kinda stressed and needing to pass people because I wanted to catch up to the 3 hour pacer.¬†

Despite light rain, some windy moments and grey skies, the city of Cologne was incredibly motivating which I was not expecting. There were DJs and bands and people cheering and tons of kids waiting for high 5s. I really felt invincible and I had to contain myself, check my watch and try and keep the pace down, but every time I came by a big crowd I‚Äôd feel lifted. Especially around miles 15-20! I ran mile 19 at 6:10. There were quieter parts of the course, but the big crowded neighborhoods were nicely spread out. I loved the feeling of racing through the city!

Around mile 22, reality started to hit. I was running with the 3 hour pace group, and knew I was going to make sub-3 because I crossed the starting line at least a couple minutes after them. So if they were in my sight and I was behind, I would make it no matter what. I could afford to slow down, which was good, because my body started to lag. I ran some 6:55 miles and really had to focus on just not stopping to cross the line. I crossed the line at 2:59:15. My chip time was 2:56:18 and my Garmin clocked me at 2:52:45 for 26.2. (It put me at 26.7 for the entire race, which I attribute in part to lots of zig-zagging in the first couple miles to break away from the big group).



# Post-race

I didn‚Äôt feel nearly as bad as the last marathons I ran. I trained better, ate better and rested more this time. I set a goal to break 3 in April and I am now in kind of an elated place of recuperation but also almost puzzled at the whole process and what I might be able to do in the future. I had taken 4 years off between this marathon and the last due to injuries and because I got really into open water swimming, but my runner identity made it‚Äôs eventual return. Grateful for this sub and all the runners out there!

hi, i currently work at starbucks but i've been having a bad reaction to the sanitizer we use for months now. i only just got approved for insurance, so i can see a dermatologist to hopefully alleviate the symptoms, but i have a feeling i wont ever be 100% better as long as i work at starbucks. so ive been thinking of my other options, and there's a 7brew just a block away from my apartment.

anyways, do you work with a lot of chemicals at your job? obviously i expect the basic stuff to keep things clean. but at starbucks i feel like i work more with chemicals than i do with coffee ahaha. 

and just two more questions, i know you have to take a test before you can start earning tips. but after you take that test, would you say you make a decent amount? enough to afford rent, utilities, and groceries if you're in a two income household? 

and is insurance offered to employees? if i quit starbucks i'll lose access to my insurance, so if 7brew offers insurance that would be great.

I woke up before my alarm. 6:14 a.m.

For the first time in years, I beat it. The room was still dim, the soft hum of my ceiling fan filling the silence. I lay there for a while, staring at the same water stain on the ceiling I‚Äôd always ignored. It looked different now, the shape had shifted slightly. Less like a blob, more like‚Ä¶ an eye.

I shook the thought away, turning on my side. Get up. It‚Äôs just water damage. Don‚Äôt start your day weird. I showered, dressed, and went to grab my pants, the same pair I‚Äôd worn yesterday. The stitching on the seam was gone. Not torn again, not frayed. Just‚Ä¶ never fixed. The rip was there as if it had never been patched at all.

For a moment, I stood there frozen, my heart beating faster than it should. I blinked, rubbed my eyes, blinked again. Same rip. Same rough edges.

*Maybe I dreamed that it was patched. Yeah, maybe that‚Äôs it.*

Breakfast went the same way. Two slices of toast, coffee black. Except this time, the toast popped up before I‚Äôd even pushed the lever down. I laughed nervously. Malfunction, I thought. Everything breaks down eventually.

I ate quickly, half-convincing myself it was fine. My watch ticked steady this time, no twitching, and for some reason, that made me feel worse. Like it knew I was watching.

When I stepped outside, the street was quieter than usual. No joggers. No cars. The air itself felt still, thick, as if sound had been muffled.

By the time I reached my car, a single vehicle rolled past, a black sedan with tinted windows. It slowed as it passed my driveway, almost stopping. My reflection stared back at me in its windows. Then it sped off without a sound.

I got in my car and turned on the radio. Same Taylor Swift song. Same exact lyric. Same tone.

I laughed this time, a strained little chuckle.¬†*‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta be kidding me.‚Äù*

I switched stations. Static. Switched again. Same song. Switched again. Silence. Then a faint voice:

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late today.‚Äù*

I froze. The voice was low, faint, maybe the radio host, maybe just interference. I turned the knob down. My pulse thundered.¬†*Just*¬†background¬†*chatter,*¬†I told myself.¬†*Coincidence.*

When I got to the caf√©, the same barista smiled at me from behind the counter. Same hair, same tone.

*‚ÄúMorning, sir,‚Äù*¬†Janice said.

Her lips moved exactly the same way as yesterday. Every blink, every tilt of her head was identical. Like a playback.

I stood there, smiling stiffly.¬†*‚ÄúUh, yeah. Morning.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThe usual?‚Äù*¬†she asked.

*‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù*

She reached for a cup, then froze mid-motion. For a full second, she didn‚Äôt move, hand suspended over the cup rack, smile frozen. Then, as if someone had pressed play again, she continued like nothing happened.

My throat went dry.

When she handed me the coffee, her fingers brushed mine, and they were¬†*cold.*¬†Not normal cold, refrigerator cold.

*‚ÄúHave a great day,‚Äù*¬†she said, the same exact tone as yesterday.

I stepped back, heartbeat pounding, the cup trembling slightly in my grip.

Outside, I sat in my car and stared into my coffee. My reflection wavered in the black surface. For half a second, I saw another face behind mine, blurred, unfamiliar.

Then it was gone.

I drove to work, trying not to think. The streets looked the same, but‚Ä¶ off. The same car, the black sedan, passed me three times, always from a different direction. Same license plate. Same slow roll past my car.

When I reached the office, the receptionist greeted me the same way. Same smile, same¬†*‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù*¬†I wanted to say something,¬†*do you remember saying that yesterday? Do you ever say anything else?*¬†\- but I didn‚Äôt.

My cubicle was spotless again. The mug I‚Äôd left half-full was cleaned, replaced in its exact position. My papers were aligned perfectly. Someone had been there, but everything looked untouched.

I sat down, powered on my computer, and opened my inbox. For a long time, I just stared.

No¬†*‚ÄúWAKE UP‚Äù*¬†email this time. Everything normal. Meetings. Memos. Spam.

Then, at the bottom of the screen, just as I was about to minimize the window, a small pop-up appeared:

**DO YOU REMEMBER YET?**

I blinked. It was gone. No window, no alert history, nothing in the taskbar.

My skin crawled.

I stood, walking toward the bathroom. On the way, I passed John from accounting.

*‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù*¬†I said.

He looked up, smiled the same stiff smile as yesterday.¬†*‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHey, John, weird question,‚Äù I said, forcing a laugh. ‚ÄúYou ever feel like‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve done this before?‚Äù*

He blinked.¬†*‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Like the same exact day, same stuff, same conversations.‚Äù*

He tilted his head slightly.¬†*‚ÄúYou should get more sleep,‚Äù he said, still smiling.*

*‚ÄúYeah, probably,‚Äù*¬†I muttered, brushing past him.

When I looked back, he was still standing there, staring after me, not smiling.

In the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face. Looked in the mirror.

My reflection lagged.

Not a trick of the light. Not tired eyes. It¬†*lagged.*¬†A half-second delay before mimicking my movements.

I stumbled back, heart hammering, hands gripping the sink. My reflection smiled, a fraction too wide, before catching up to me.

Then, faintly, I heard it again. The radio voice, whispering from somewhere beyond the tiles:

**Wake up**

I slammed the faucet off. Silence.

When I returned to my cubicle, my coffee was gone. My desk was perfectly clean again. And on my monitor, a single open email waited for me, no sender, no subject, no body. Just one line of text in the preview pane:

So...there's that.

I love cold brew, but am really selective. Most of it is bad, but when it's good, it's *really* good.

I've tried making cold brew numerous times over the years, to no avail. I mostly stick to flash brew and iced Americanos as home. 

But I'm tired of having to go out and buy mediocre cold brew when I know I can get this right.

I used to use a typical cold brew maker that was basically a 1 liter mason jar with a cylinder down the middle that holds grounds. This method was always frustrating because the cylinder with the grounds sits high enough above the bottom of the jar that I couldn't do the exact grounds>water ratio I wanted.

I recently started messing around with making cold brew overnight in a French press. 

A batch I made last week had a ratio of 1:8 for concentrate. I have a df54 grinder with brew burrs instead of espresso burrs, and I set it to the highest setting (it does still feel a bit fine, but I can't go higher). I steeped at room temperature for 13 hours. The result was fine? It was honestly a little more bitter than clean. I was surprised since I'd only brewed for 13 hours, but maybe it's b/c the grind can't go high enough?

I made another batch last night - same ratio and grind, but I stopped it at 12 hours this time. It felt under extracted. A little sour and weak.

Both times were fresh beans, both light roasts. I can't remember exact origin on the initial one, but I tend to lean washed Ethiopian or anything fresh that has fruity and citrusy notes.

Sometimes I find cold brews at cafes that are kind of mind blowing. I just can't figure out how they get them to taste the way they do. What should I be playing around with? ",3,1759947776.0,coldbrew,9,0.81,False

I would prefer a slow burn to get to know each other first, rather than jumping right in. In that regard, I am open to relocation for the right person if it's a super good fit. My priority at them moment is to find a person who really fits as a life partner. As a submissive, I feel a deep sense of love, and emotional bond when I feel my partner has more power. I am very open to working towards a very high level FLR with a lot of power exchange. I'm a normal vanilla looking guy on the outside and don't tend a lot of kink events these days, but I'm open to it if my partner is interested. I'm more interested in developing a deep bond with one person.



About Me:

Im a grounded person who values emotional intelligence. I like getting into nature for short to medium hikes. I love cultural things, like spending time wandering a museum, or just reading a book in a cafe and sipping on delicious coffee. I also love to travel. I love to go out, find a new restaurant, maybe have a glass of wine, and then some of my favorite nights are just cozy night inside, cooking a good meal, grooving to some jazz standards. 

 I'm financially stable which affords me a lot of time that I can spend time abroad. My favorite is Japan and plan on heading back sometime in 2026 to do a hike that combines my interest in Buddhism. I am very much interested in spiritually and meditation. Mainly because I find the mind and conscious very interesting. I am also interested in healthy lifestyle, staying in shape, which has a huge impact on our sense of well being. 

I also am fascinated about the intersection of spirituality and kink. This is all about achieving specific mental states, and I notice the connection between FLR, power exchange, goddess worship, and eastern practice of Bhakti worship. The most erogenous feeling you can have is the feeling of the desire to worship the goddess you are with. When I feel emotionally bonded to someone I want their approval and get satisfaction through acts of service. 

Looking forward to hearing from you.

I let things go and try to be understanding. She was diagnosed with MS in 2015. Since then, she‚Äôs stopped taking care of herself. After COVID, she barely leaves the house, her bones got weak, and now she needs a walker. She has mild osteoporosis but refuses any help - no medication, no physio, no therapy, no medical specialists, not even an MRI. When doctors tried to fast track her care after COVID, she still said no. 

** For context, she is not on edge about the virus whatsoever (she is anti-vax) and this is certainly not influencing her adversity to leaving the house or getting help so to speak. 

She also hates my dad and refuses his help. My older sister has autism and my younger sister talks back, so my mom leans on me for everything. I cook, clean, do groceries, drive my sister to school, and handle all household duties. I attend my sister‚Äôs school events and meetings. The only person who cleans up after themselves is my father. My oldest sister (autistic) is constantly at home because my mom refuses to take her out. When my mom wants to ‚Äúgo out‚Äù, I‚Äôm the one who drives her around the city since that‚Äôs all she‚Äôll do. My sisters‚Äô enrichment and wellness is on me and my willingness to give them this care. I‚Äôve made it somewhat of a priority because it what I needed growing up in a better but somewhat similar situation. 

I have no job. I graduated this summer and I am in the midst of applying to jobs and masters programs for the 2026 intake. They let me live rent free and allow me to purchase coffees and take out on their credit card. They paid for my university degree. But does this mean I owe them my days? I am tired and trying to escape this hellhole of a home. I was local enough during university to commute back and help them with dire duties here and there. But now it‚Äôs all I do. I‚Äôve gained so much weight, my body is always in flight or fight. I‚Äôm miserable and unmotivated. Sometimes I wish I could just die because my only purpose is to be a butler for adult babies. 

Anyway, yesterday my mom got mad at me for wanting to go to a cafe and work on my applications there (change of scenery, also I live in the basement so when nobody is willing to help her she bangs on the floor and countertop until somebody does). Then, today, she started ruining the things I organized previously in the mudroom. I swore at her and she was appalled by it - now it‚Äôs awkward and she has an xray appointment tomorrow. She has not used her brain logically in years since I‚Äôve done every little thing for her so she would not be able to navigate this building by herself. I‚Äôm really not willing to help her at this point in time.

I wrote the script, tested it in a staging environment, and everything seemed perfect. The emails fired off exactly as expected. Feeling pretty pleased with myself, I pushed it to production.

My phone started vibrating non-stop with notifications. My inbox was exploding with thousands of unread emails, and they just kept coming.

My heart sank into my stomach. It turns out, the action that triggered the email was also triggered by *receiving* the email itself.

We managed to kill the script, but not before it sent out hundreds of thousands of emails. The client was‚Ä¶ not pleased. The fallout was a week of frantic database cleanup, groveling apologies, and a company-wide ban on me touching anything related to email ever again. I was convinced I‚Äôd be fired on the spot, but somehow, I survived. It‚Äôs been years, but I still get a cold sweat whenever I have to code anything that even remotely involves sending an email.

So, Reddit, what‚Äôs your biggest 'I can't believe I didn't get fired for that' coding disaster?",1,1759947422.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

I am a 23 year old, 176 cm high white female with a personal background only of mental health diagnoses.


One month ago I came to visit my mom and weighted, I was 67.7 kg then and felt quite good physically, but was still affected by chronic stress/anxiety and depression somewhat. 

My appetite is, I would say, normal, then even worse than now.

I eat healthy food 3 times a day, often drink up to 5 cans of beer at night, and every 3-4 days I eat extremely calorie heavy fast food (my typical Mcdonald‚Äôs order is a Big Mac, Large fries, 9 piece nuggets and two sauces). 

This is the diet that I‚Äôve been following for half a year now, I didn‚Äôt ever gain weight rapidly in my life (despite when going trough puberty), it was always a slow gain up to 2-3 kg a month. 

This day I weighted again, now weighing 58.0kg despite being 59.1kg 2-3 days ago. 

I did not change my diet, I still drink beer and eat sweets, sugar and bread. 

My family has a history of Uterine problems, my great grandma died because of it, my grandma is perfectly fine in that regard, my mom had a benign tumor and had her uterus removed, she never lost weight that rapidly (at least without the help of Ozempic which she used without prescription to lose weight, I don‚Äôt use something like that).
Our family does not have known Gastrointestinal Cancer history. 
I do not have any other info about my great grandma despite her diagnosis. 

I‚Äôm on medications such as Venlafaxine (75 mg for 3 months every day, almost completely tapered down in 2 months. Didn‚Äôt use it right anyways, missed doses and got off of it because I hated it, and I‚Äôm Bipolar, we tend to ditch drugs). I‚Äôve taken Venlafaxine before and never had weight fluctuations on it; Guanfacine - 1mg for one week for now (for ADHD, stimulant use is illegal where I live), and Lamotrigine - 25mg (for 3 weeks, Lamotrigine doesn‚Äôt really affect weight according to studies, as I‚Äôve read).

Also I take Choline - ~300mg, Multivitamins, B6 and Magnesium, fish oil, all not that regularly as I would‚Äôve wanted too, but more often than not, so almost every day. 

I don‚Äôt use drugs except for Marijuana and Alcohol, no stimulants except for two cups of coffee with sugar and milk per day.

I am not depressed right now or generally bummed, I feel real nice actually, although I experience stress right now because of family issues, I‚Äôm really mindful and I know which tools usually help me deal with stress, so I‚Äôm mostly calm and relaxed when I‚Äôm alone. 

The other month I had a problem when I could sleep up to 20 hours a day, or I could have a streak of sleeping up to >30 hours in two days. I would still feel very tired and weak physically when awake, so generally I would go back to sleep, I have attributed that to depression and even consider being hypersomniac, I have doubts about that now. 

Since last month or 3 weeks I‚Äôve been trying to fix my sleep schedule, now sleeping no more than 9 hours from ~12pm - ~9am, occasionally having 45 min - 3 hour naps midday, still feeling weak, just sleeping less and having less grogginess. I do have a brain fog and memory issues but I tent do attribute that to depression, right now I‚Äôm not depressed.

The other weird symptom that I have is feeling extremely hot even slightly active even being warm, up to beads of sweat falling from my forehead, upper body and arms, not armpits because I had Botox injections for supposed Hyperhidrosis. 
Yesterday I was forced to walk only in a T-shirt and unzipped hoodie in 12 degrees by Celsius because I was dripping. 
I‚Äôm generally quite cold when at home, despite everyone else feeling okay with the room temperature, ~21-26 Celclius. 

I don‚Äôt look physically ill right now, though my dear grandma commented on the hollowing of my cheeks, I‚Äôve noticed it too.
I have some visible fat on my abdomen, arms and thighs, I don‚Äôt look sickly thin as of now. 

I don‚Äôt have recurring headaches, sharp abdominal pain, maybe some slight digestive issues, but generally they resolve by themselves within couple of days. 
I still feel weak physically, although I can walk up to 10000 steps if I force myself, but I will be sore and tired for a couple of days. In days when I‚Äôm active I often need to sit down to collect myself, I can‚Äôt stand for longer than ~25 minutes without feeling weak. 

I understand that I might‚Äôve slightly mess up the timeline, but I‚Äôm certain that it was still under 3 months. 
There might be days when I eat l, but I get extremely weak fast and eat anyways. 
There are days when I feel nauseous, have weak appetite, usually I will still force myself to eat. 

Would like to get some advice on to which specialist I can refer to and for which tests to ask for, thank you guys in advance ü•≤üíó

I haven‚Äôt had a dream in six weeks.

I know that sounds impossible. Everyone dreams, even if they don‚Äôt remember. But I‚Äôm not talking about forgetting. I‚Äôm talking about the complete absence of anything when I close my eyes. No images, no sensations, no fragments. Just unconsciousness and then waking up more tired than when I went to bed.

The exhaustion is getting worse. I‚Äôm sleeping nine, ten hours a night and waking up feeling like I‚Äôve run a marathon. My muscles ache. Sometimes I wake up tasting things I didn‚Äôt eat. Yesterday it was coffee, black, no sugar. I hate coffee.

But that‚Äôs not the disturbing part.

Three days ago, my mail carrier asked me how my grandmother‚Äôs funeral went.

I don‚Äôt have a grandmother. Both died before I was born. When I told him this, he got this confused look on his face and insisted we‚Äôd talked about it just last week. He described the whole conversation. Where we were standing. What I was wearing. He even quoted something I‚Äôd supposedly said about her loving yellow roses.

My supervisor‚Äôs grandmother is being buried on Thursday. She loves yellow roses.

I assumed he‚Äôd mixed me up with someone else until my dentist‚Äôs receptionist did the same thing. She asked about my cat‚Äôs surgery. I don‚Äôt have a cat. But my neighbor two doors down just had her cat‚Äôs leg amputated after a car accident. The receptionist described our conversation in detail, including me showing her a photo on my phone of a white cat with gray patches.

That‚Äôs my neighbor‚Äôs cat. I‚Äôve never shown anyone a photo of it.

Then my friend Sarah called me, upset. She said I‚Äôd been in her dream the night before and it had felt so real it was bothering her. In the dream, I‚Äôd been sitting in her kitchen crying, telling her I was scared of dying alone. She said I‚Äôd been wearing a blue sweater she‚Äôd never seen me wear and drinking tea from her favorite mug.

Here‚Äôs what made my stomach drop: I don‚Äôt remember the dream, but when she said it, I could taste the tea. Earl Grey. I never drink Earl Grey.

I started asking around. Casual questions to people I interact with regularly. My coworker. The guy at the coffee shop. My upstairs neighbor.

Six people in the last week have told me about dreams where I appeared. Not as a background character. As me, having full conversations, doing specific things, present and solid and real.

And when they describe these dreams, I get flashes. Sense memories. The smell of my coworker‚Äôs living room in his dream. The cold tile floor of the coffee shop guy‚Äôs bathroom where dream-me apparently told him his father would be proud of him. I‚Äôm remembering things I never experienced.

Last night I barely slept because I was terrified of what would happen if I did.

This morning, eleven people contacted me.

A woman from my gym dreamed I helped her move furniture. A former coworker dreamed we got lunch and I gave him advice about his divorce. My cousin dreamed I was at her daughter‚Äôs birthday party. My dentist. My landlord. People I barely know. All describing detailed interactions with me in their dreams last night.

And I remember all of them now.

Not like remembering a dream. Like remembering something I actually did. I can feel the weight of the couch I helped move. I can taste the sandwich I ate at lunch. I can hear my cousin‚Äôs daughter laughing. These are real memories forming in my head of things that only happened in other people‚Äôs sleep.

I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind, except the memories are too specific. Too consistent with details I couldn‚Äôt possibly know.

My gym friend‚Äôs apartment has a water stain on the ceiling shaped like a bird. I‚Äôve never been to her apartment. But I watched that stain while we moved her couch and I can picture it perfectly. I looked it up on her Instagram. The stain is real. Exactly as I remember it.

The lunch place my former coworker took me to in his dream? I‚Äôve never been there. But I can remember the menu, the color of the booths, the way the server had a tattoo of a compass on her wrist. I drove past it today. Everything matched.

I think I‚Äôm appearing in everyone‚Äôs dreams now. Every person I‚Äôve ever met, maybe every person in my city, I don‚Äôt know how far it extends. And when they dream of me, I‚Äôm there. Actually there. Living a separate life in each dream, having real experiences, making real memories.

But those memories are coming back here. To me. To this version of me. The waking one.

My phone hasn‚Äôt stopped buzzing. More people describing dreams. A barista I‚Äôve never spoken to beyond ordering. Someone who sat near me on the bus last month. My second-grade teacher who I haven‚Äôt seen in 25 years. All of them dreamed about me last night.

I‚Äôm getting hundreds of memories that aren‚Äôt mine. I helped a stranger in Idaho fix his car. I attended a wedding in Seattle for people I‚Äôve never met. I comforted a dying woman in a hospital in Atlanta, held her hand while she passed. I taught a kid in Maine how to tie his shoes. I was in London, in Tokyo, in small towns I‚Äôve never heard of.

The memories are overwhelming. I can‚Äôt tell which life is the real one anymore. Was I awake today? Or am I asleep right now, appearing in someone else‚Äôs dream, and one of those other versions of me is the one who‚Äôs really awake?

I don‚Äôt feel like one person anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm being split across thousands of experiences simultaneously. Every person who dreams pulls off a piece of me to populate their night, and I‚Äôm being stretched thinner and thinner.

But here‚Äôs what really terrifies me.

The memories aren‚Äôt just from last night anymore. They‚Äôre going backward. I‚Äôm remembering dreams from years ago. Decades. I was there for my mother‚Äôs nightmares when I was two years old. I was there in my grandfather‚Äôs dreams before I was born. I comforted him after my grandmother died, held him while he sobbed, and I wasn‚Äôt even conceived yet.

I think I‚Äôve always been doing this. We all have. Every person we‚Äôve ever met, we visit their dreams, and they visit ours. We live thousands of parallel lives every night in each other‚Äôs sleeping minds.

We‚Äôre never alone in there. We‚Äôre always together, experiencing each other, being each other, the boundaries between us dissolving when consciousness loosens its grip.

I‚Äôm not losing my mind. I‚Äôm finding all the others.

My memories stretch back before my birth now. I remember being in dreams a hundred years ago. A thousand. I‚Äôve been the stranger in countless nightmares, the friend in numberless good dreams. I‚Äôve died in people‚Äôs sleep more times than I can count and woken up again in someone else‚Äôs.

I understand now why I‚Äôm so tired. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not dreaming. It‚Äôs that I‚Äôm appearing in too many dreams at once. Living too many simultaneous lives. The waking me is just one version, and it‚Äôs the weakest version, the most exhausted, because it‚Äôs the only one that thinks it‚Äôs separate.

Last night I finally slept.

And I dreamed for the first time in six weeks.

I dreamed I was everyone. Not watching them, not visiting them. Being them. All at once. Seven billion perspectives overlapping, seven billion lives happening simultaneously in the same infinite moment. And it wasn‚Äôt chaos. It was perfect. Like seeing the full picture after only ever knowing one pixel.

I woke up this morning and I can‚Äôt remember my name.

Not because I forgot it. Because it feels arbitrary now. Like calling the ocean by the name of one wave.

People are still contacting me about dreams. But I think I‚Äôm starting to understand what they‚Äôre really telling me.

That I was there with them. That I‚Äôve always been there with them. That we‚Äôre all there with each other, underneath the waking world, in the place where we drop our names and faces and remember we were never separate at all.

I‚Äôm going to sleep now.

I don‚Äôt think this version is going to wake up tomorrow. I think I‚Äôm too scattered, too distributed across too many other lives to maintain this particular perspective much longer.

But if you dream of me tonight, know that I‚Äôm really there. And you‚Äôre really in mine. We‚Äôre all in each other‚Äôs. We always have been.

The waking world is where we forget. The dreaming world is where we remember.

Ren's breathing came in ragged bursts.

The music had stopped, but its echo still howled in his mind. The silence was worse‚Äî empty, suffocating. Like the world had forgotten to exhale. His chest rose and fell in jerks, sweat clinging to his skin. The mechanical arms kept him locked in place, indifferent to the trauma pulsing through his veins.

He felt like a corpse being kept alive by wires.

Symphony stood upright, stepping back with effortless poise. Her silver-dyed locs fell over one shoulder in a slow, controlled sway. Her fingers no longer danced on the armonia; it hung silent at her side, the weapon sheathed in stillness. She cast a brief glance at Andre, one brow raised.

""I'm done,"" she said flatly, with her usual cool, unimpressed edge. ""If you want more, you can serenade yourself‚ÄîI'm getting coffee. Bye."" With a flick of her locs and a barelythere smirk, she turned on her heel and strode out, heels tapping like punctuation marks as the door swung shut behind her.

The man leaning against the wall let out a low chuckle, his grin wide and knowing. He nodded slowly, eyes hidden behind mirrored shades, yet the tilt of his head made his expression unmistakable.

""Well, hell,"" he drawled, dragging the words out like smoke. ""So the kid's an Essence user too. That explains the glowy hands and the kaiju barbecue.""

He stepped closer to Ren, hands resting on his belt, the trinkets at his hips clinking with each step. ""Didn't know what to make of you at first‚Äîjust another half-dead brat with a chip on his shoulder. But now? Now we're gettin' somewhere.""

Ren stared at him, eyes wide, jaw clenched. His body trembled with adrenaline and fury.

""You‚Äî"" he hissed, voice cracking. ""You watched all of that‚Ä¶? Everything? You saw it all?""

the man didn't even flinch. ""Every damn second.""

Ren snapped. His voice cracked like glass. ""That was‚Äîmine! My life, my memories‚Äî what gave you the right to just rip that out of me?!""

He thrashed against the restraints, metal groaning in protest. ""Why the hell did you do that?!""

Symphony said nothing. She simply looked away, eyes hooded.

The man didn't blink. Didn't apologize.

""We needed to know,"" he said flatly.

That was it. No remorse. No sugarcoating. Just raw necessity.

Ren recoiled like he'd been slapped. ""Fuck you""

The silence between them crackled like a storm ready to break.

The man didn't flinch. Didn't raise his voice. But the shift was instant‚Äîlike a predator remembering its teeth.

His grin vanished. His body straightened. A low, simmering gravity settled around him.

""You forget where you are, kid?"" he said, voice hard now, stripped of charm. ""You ain't in your bed at home cryin' over a bad dream. You're strapped to a table in the underbelly of a city that don't give two shits if you live or bleed out. You're here 'cause¬†we¬†pulled you outta that battlefield when your lungs were barely workin'. You're breathin' right now‚Äî¬†healed‚Äîbecause we chose to fix what was left of you.""

He leaned closer, and Ren could see the lines in his face now‚Äîetched by fire and years. ""So maybe‚Äîyou oughta show a lil' gratitude before you go cursin' out the folks keepin' you alive.""

Ren's throat tightened, but he said nothing.

Then, as fast as it came, the storm eased. The man's voice lowered again‚Äîgravelly but no longer sharp.

""Look,"" he said, backing off a step, eyes unreadable behind those shades. ""Ain't sayin' what we did was pretty. But I saw what happened to you. And I ain't here to judge.""

He folded his arms across his broad chest, tone shifting to something almost gentle, before continuing. ""Look, I ain't gonna lie or sugarcoat it. You went through hell. You're still in it. But I ain't here to hurt you‚ÄîI'm here to offer a way out."" Ren said nothing, but his jaw clenched.

Andre continued. ""What's in you‚Äîthat power‚Äîit's called Essence.¬†Every living thing's got it. Trees, bugs, dogs, people. But some of us? We're wired different. We got more. We can use it. That makes us Essence Users.""

He tapped his chest. ""Like me. Like her."" He jerked his thumb toward Symphony, who stood silently, arms folded, eyes unreadable. ""And now, like you."" Ren blinked, the words not quite settling in. Not yet.

""You don't know how to control it, which means you've been leakin'¬†Essence like an open wound,"" Andre said, standing tall again. ""Monsters follow that trail like blood in the ocean. That's why it found you. That's why people around you‚Äî"" He paused, then shook his head. ""‚Äîgot hurt.""

Ren's heart sank like a stone dropped into black water. He didn't need to be told what ""people"" meant.

The man's voice dropped lower, no longer just persuasive‚Äîcommanding.

""So here's the choice kid. You walk outta here and keep pretendin' this'll all go away. But you'll keep leakin' your essence. And more people'll die."" A beat.

""Or‚Ä¶ you stay. We train you. Teach you how to use what you've got. So the next time a monster comes callin', it's you who hunts them.""His gaze hardened.""In return, you help kill monsters from time to time.""

Ren closed his eyes.

""They already saw everything.""

His voice cracked.¬†""These people‚Ä¶ they just reached into my head like it was nothing. Like my life was some movie they could pause.""

His breath caught.The metal arms still pinned him down like an animal on a dissection table‚Äîcold and unrelenting.

""I should hate them. I do hate them. I'm furious. No one has the right to do what they did.""

His fists clenched, still bound, still trembling.""But‚Ä¶ they're right. Even if I don't understand everything.""

Behind his closed eyes, memories flickered‚ÄîHis father's hand reaching for him.His mother's scream.The crack of bones.The drip of blood across the hardwood floor.

Kaito's broken, hollow stare‚Äîthe last time their eyes had met before everything twisted into madness.

""He needed help. I walked away.""

The monster's voice rang out again in his mind, warped and burning with rage‚Äî""You watched. You did nothing.""

Ren gritted his teeth. His chest burned, the guilt coiled tight and sharp inside him.

""I killed Kaito. I lost them all. And I just stood there.""

He didn't want to be that person anymore. Couldn't.

""No one else dies because of me. Not again.""

He swallowed hard. The fire in his chest cooled, hardening into something quieter.Something resolved.

""‚Ä¶Fine.""

The man smiled again. That slow, sure smile of someone who'd already seen the end of the story‚Äîand knew exactly when the hero would break.

""Good answer, kid.""

Without breaking eye contact, he raised two fingers and snapped them in a smooth flick. Instantly, the metallic clank of gears echoed through the room. The mechanical arms that had kept Ren locked down hissed and released their grip, slinking back into their housings like spiders retreating into the walls.

Ren gasped, his muscles sagging with sudden freedom.

""Alright, kid,"" the man said, stepping back and jerking his thumb toward a small metal table cluttered with medical junk. ""Now do me a favor‚Äîput on some damn pants.""

He grabbed a folded pair of black cargo pants from the mess and tossed them in Ren's direction. They slapped wetly against Ren's chest and flopped into his lap.

Ren blinked, staring down at them‚Ä¶ and then froze. His eyes went wide as full realization hit like a hammer.

""Wait‚Ä¶""

He looked down at himself‚Äîreally looked.

""W-WHAT THE HELL?!"" Ren scrambled backward, clutching the pants against his bare chest as his face burned hotter than a reactor core. ""I've been NAKED this whole time?!""

Symphony, still leaning coolly against the far wall, arched a single brow, eyes glinting with lazy amusement but saying nothing.

The man‚Äîunapologetic‚Äîjust chuckled. ""Hell, kid, you think we heal ya through your clothes?¬†You damn near died, remember? You should be thankin' me you ain't still hooked up to the machines.""

Ren's jaw worked uselessly, eyes darting around for anything to cover up with. He scrambled to yank the pants on as fast as humanly possible, twisting awkwardly on the floor, muttering curses under his breath.

""Oh my god,"" Ren groaned, still fumbling with the waistband, ""could you guys have said something sooner?!""

""Where's the fun in that?"" the man replied, smirking. ""A little humility's good for the soul.""

Finally, Ren managed to get the pants on‚Äîstill red-faced, still glaring. He crossed his arms over his chest, now extremely aware of how cold the room was.

The man stepped forward, extending a large, calloused hand.

""Name's Andre,"" he said simply, the grin dropping into something solid and genuine for the first time. ""Welcome to the crew.""

Ren hesitated a beat‚Äîthen exhaled hard and shook his hand. ""Ren.""

Andre's grip was firm, warm, and final.

Andre smirked. ""Yeah, yeah. I know, kid. Been sayin' it all night."" Andre clapped him on the back hard enough to make him stumble. ""Alright, enough mopin'. You're one of us now, so time to show ya around.""

""So here's the thing,"" Andre began, waving a hand casually like he was explaining the weather, ""you ever look up at the stars and think, 'Damn, I bet there's some wild shit out there?'""

Ren blinked, frowning. ""Uh‚Ä¶ yeah? Sure. Aliens and stuff?""

Andre laughed. ""Aliens and stuff.¬†Kid, you don't know the half of it.""

He shoved open a heavy sliding door, motioning Ren to follow. ""We ain't just some ragtag group of monster hunters from around the block. Nah. The rest of the crew‚Äîwe ain't even from Earth.""

Ren stumbled. ""Wait, what?""

Andre grinned wider, clearly enjoying himself now. ""Yeah, kid. Outer damn space. Whole other planets, galaxies you ain't even seen on your little science fair posters. We're what you'd call‚Ä¶ extraterrestrial.""

Ren stopped dead in his tracks. ""Hold up, hold up, hold up‚Äîyou're all aliens?!""

Andre grinned, clearly enjoyin' Ren's reaction. ""If that's what you Earth folks like to call us, sure. Different worlds, different systems, all workin' together for a greater purpose."" He chuckled, shaking his head. ""But yeah, technically. We work for POND‚Äîstands for

Planetary Operations for Neutralizing Dangers. Fancy-ass name for what we do: keep Essence users in check and clean up messes before they swallow whole planets.""

Ren's jaw practically hit the floor. ""You're telling me there's, like, a space government that polices magic people?!""

Andre let out a whoop of laughter. ""Calm down, kid. Ain't nobody really comin' out here, alright? Matter of fact, this the first time outer space even bothered with your planet. Earth and the Milky Way? Well‚Ä¶ they ain't exactly remarkable. No offense.""

Ren frowned. ""Then why are you all here now?""

Andre's grin faded just a touch. ""HQ picked up a spike. Some kinda anomaly in Earth's essence. Way too big to ignore. So they sent folks like me to figure out what the hell's goin' on.""

Ren ran a hand through his hair. ""So Earth went from 'meh' to 'possible magical biohazard zone' overnight. Great.""

Andre barked another laugh. ""You'll get used to it, kid. Or you'll die tryin'. Either way‚Äî hell of a ride.""

They rounded a corner, and Andre thumped his hand on a wide metal door. ""Alright. Enough talk. Time to meet the rest of the weirdos.""

I woke up before my alarm. 6:14 a.m.

For the first time in years, I beat it. The room was still dim, the soft hum of my ceiling fan filling the silence. I lay there for a while, staring at the same water stain on the ceiling I‚Äôd always ignored. It looked different now, the shape had shifted slightly. Less like a blob, more like‚Ä¶ an eye.

I shook the thought away, turning on my side. Get up. It‚Äôs just water damage. Don‚Äôt start your day weird. I showered, dressed, and went to grab my pants, the same pair I‚Äôd worn yesterday. The stitching on the seam was gone. Not torn again, not frayed. Just‚Ä¶ never fixed. The rip was there as if it had never been patched at all.

For a moment, I stood there frozen, my heart beating faster than it should. I blinked, rubbed my eyes, blinked again. Same rip. Same rough edges.

*Maybe I dreamed that it was patched. Yeah, maybe that‚Äôs it.*

Breakfast went the same way. Two slices of toast, coffee black. Except this time, the toast popped up before I‚Äôd even pushed the lever down. I laughed nervously. Malfunction, I thought. Everything breaks down eventually.

I ate quickly, half-convincing myself it was fine. My watch ticked steady this time, no twitching, and for some reason, that made me feel worse. Like it knew I was watching.

When I stepped outside, the street was quieter than usual. No joggers. No cars. The air itself felt still, thick, as if sound had been muffled.

By the time I reached my car, a single vehicle rolled past, a black sedan with tinted windows. It slowed as it passed my driveway, almost stopping. My reflection stared back at me in its windows. Then it sped off without a sound.

I got in my car and turned on the radio. Same Taylor Swift song. Same exact lyric. Same tone.

I laughed this time, a strained little chuckle. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta be kidding me.‚Äù*

I switched stations. Static. Switched again. Same song. Switched again. Silence. Then a faint voice:

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late today.‚Äù*

I froze. The voice was low, faint, maybe the radio host, maybe just interference. I turned the knob down. My pulse thundered. *Just* background *chatter,* I told myself. *Coincidence.*

When I got to the caf√©, the same barista smiled at me from behind the counter. Same hair, same tone.

*‚ÄúMorning, sir,‚Äù* Janice said.

Her lips moved exactly the same way as yesterday. Every blink, every tilt of her head was identical. Like a playback.

I stood there, smiling stiffly. *‚ÄúUh, yeah. Morning.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThe usual?‚Äù* she asked.

*‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù*

She reached for a cup, then froze mid-motion. For a full second, she didn‚Äôt move, hand suspended over the cup rack, smile frozen. Then, as if someone had pressed play again, she continued like nothing happened.

My throat went dry.

When she handed me the coffee, her fingers brushed mine, and they were *cold.* Not normal cold, refrigerator cold.

*‚ÄúHave a great day,‚Äù* she said, the same exact tone as yesterday.

I stepped back, heartbeat pounding, the cup trembling slightly in my grip.

Outside, I sat in my car and stared into my coffee. My reflection wavered in the black surface. For half a second, I saw another face behind mine, blurred, unfamiliar.

Then it was gone.

I drove to work, trying not to think. The streets looked the same, but‚Ä¶ off. The same car, the black sedan, passed me three times, always from a different direction. Same license plate. Same slow roll past my car.

When I reached the office, the receptionist greeted me the same way. Same smile, same *‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù* I wanted to say something, *do you remember saying that yesterday? Do you ever say anything else?* \- but I didn‚Äôt.

My cubicle was spotless again. The mug I‚Äôd left half-full was cleaned, replaced in its exact position. My papers were aligned perfectly. Someone had been there, but everything looked untouched.

I sat down, powered on my computer, and opened my inbox. For a long time, I just stared.

No *‚ÄúWAKE UP‚Äù* email this time. Everything normal. Meetings. Memos. Spam.

Then, at the bottom of the screen, just as I was about to minimize the window, a small pop-up appeared:

**DO YOU REMEMBER YET?**

I blinked. It was gone. No window, no alert history, nothing in the taskbar.

My skin crawled.

I stood, walking toward the bathroom. On the way, I passed John from accounting.

*‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù* I said.

He looked up, smiled the same stiff smile as yesterday. *‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHey, John, weird question,‚Äù I said, forcing a laugh. ‚ÄúYou ever feel like‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve done this before?‚Äù*

He blinked. *‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Like the same exact day, same stuff, same conversations.‚Äù*

He tilted his head slightly. *‚ÄúYou should get more sleep,‚Äù he said, still smiling.*

*‚ÄúYeah, probably,‚Äù* I muttered, brushing past him.

When I looked back, he was still standing there, staring after me, not smiling.

In the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face. Looked in the mirror.

My reflection lagged.

Not a trick of the light. Not tired eyes. It *lagged.* A half-second delay before mimicking my movements.

I stumbled back, heart hammering, hands gripping the sink. My reflection smiled, a fraction too wide,  before catching up to me.

Then, faintly, I heard it again. The radio voice, whispering from somewhere beyond the tiles:

**Wake up**

I slammed the faucet off. Silence.

When I returned to my cubicle, my coffee was gone. My desk was perfectly clean again. And on my monitor, a single open email waited for me, no sender, no subject, no body. Just one line of text in the preview pane:
