1h8k93a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1h8k93a/still_struggling_6_months_on/,still struggling 6 months on,"hi all,

i bought a robot back in june and have really struggled to get consistently good shots with it. i've used it 3-4 times a week since then.

i currently own a timemore 064S and previously had a DF64. i've had issues with the robot using both grinders, so think it's a user issue on my end or something with the robot itself (although there is nothing glaringly obvious that i can see).

things i've tried:

- watching various youtube channels etc.
- dosing beans from 15-20g (usually 18g).
- dosing water from 70ml-100ml (usually 90ml).
- using WDT and not using WDT.
- tamping hard and tamping light.
- grinding finer and coarser ('espresso' on the 064S is 0-4. i usually grind at around 1 or a hair under, but have tried numerous settings).
- various beans from medium to dark roast profiles, including roast dates (i.e. beans roasted 2 weeks ago and beans roasted 2 months ago).
- pushing down on the levers hard and softly.
- pre-infusing slightly and not pre-infusing at all.

my primary issue is that about 90% of the time i seem to have channeling. i can choke the machine and then i will step back on the grind setting slightly, but i still seem to either get 'this is way too easy' and sputtering, or 'this is way too difficult' and a minuscule stream which usually ends up diverting into multiple. i am fairly tall (6'1) with long arms, so seem to be able to get good enough leverage (although i still find it a bit awkward to use).

the silicone gasket seems to be fine and i can't see anything else that is wrong. the ONLY thing i can think that perhaps i'm tamping unevenly (i use the stock tamper), but if i am, i think it would be happening pretty infrequently.

for some additional context, i've previously owned a flair and would say 90% of my shots on that were fantastic. with the robot, i would say maybe 10% of my shots have that 'perfect' single stream of espresso coming from the basket. thankfully not all of my shots on the robot are awful, but the majority are either average or bad. i also tend to make a pseudo flat white/cortado exclusively, so some of the faults with the shot are masked by milk.

prior to the flair, i used an aeropress or v60 for the last 10 years, so i'm fairly new to the world of (home) espresso but not coffee more generally.

anything else i'm missing or could try?",1,1733544564.0,CafelatRobot,0,1.0,False
1h8k8oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1h8k8oo/its_getting_dark/,It's getting dark,"Yes, another overdramatic 1L.

A long time ago, before I was put on a shit ton of medication, I started having panic attacks with psychotic features. What this meant was that when I started to feel anxious of scared I had like ten minutes to get somewhere safe before I became convinced that people were trying to kill me. Multiple times I called friends to beg them to spare my life because I was sure they had ordered me killed. Sometimes I would hyperfixate on imaginary poisons and I'd get so much somatic pain I'd pass out or throw up but I was too scared to go to the hospital.

I keep telling myself that I survived that I can survive this.

I just wanted to go to law school and become a lawyer and wear a suit and work in a skyscraper. I think I'm probably going to fail out of school. We have our first exam tomorrow and I havent' done a single complete practice exam. I've tried but I can't focus. I did some multiple choice problems and got like 75% of them. I slept 15 hours today.

I'm so tired. Law school is so lonely. This was a mistake.

Everyone I grew up with is working at A-list tech companies and making the world a better place. I got into a T14 but I'm a fucking disaster. My brain is sick. My chest hurts.

I'm going to try to do one full essay question before I go to bed. I'm going to give my best friend a hug before the exam tomorrow. He's my favorite part of law school. There's a girl I've been flirting with I'm going to ask if she wants to get coffee before winter break. Genuinely, truly, don't know what she'll say.

I don't know how to end this one.

It could be done effectively by creating a text based website similar to reddit. Organizations mint their own tokens that act as votes in their DAO and a corresponding branch of the website would be created similar to a subreddit. The content of the sub would be voted on through the DAO, so that organizations could use it for generating rules and regulations democratically.

This would allow organizations as small as high school chess clubs and as large as international charities to generate regulations text.

Expanding on the idea, it could also be used to harbor treasuries and create bonding to ensure people follow the rules. Things like the ""fair trade"" sticker on coffee beans could be democratized. What does the sticker mean? It's been voted on by the DAO and the rules are publicly available. How do I know the company adheres to the rules? they've bonded $ that's held by the DAO treasury and lose it if they're in violation of those rules.

Couldn't find anything out there that exists or has this idea laid out. I truly feel like theirs huge potential in making DAO's easier to implement.",1,1733544415.0,CryptoCurrency,0,1.0,False

**Hey there, soldier.**

**...**

**Oh, no, don’t mind me. You want to climb out that window, I’m not gonna stop you. Probably couldn’t, with all those big muscles you have on you. I’m gonna pull up my stool here, enjoy the show. You know it’s a two story drop straight down, right? You sneak some combat spells in here for that? A hospital gown of featherfall or something?**

**...**

**Oh, you’re just gonna tough it out and climb. All right. You do you, buddy.** 

**...**

**Nah, I’m sure you could survive it. Question is how much you’ll regret surviving when you hit the ground. I’ll lay odds on it with you. Ten gold says at least two broken bones. Another ten says every single one of those forty-seven stitches I put in you this morning pops when you hit the ground.** (speaker makes a vocal noise to simulate 47 stitches popping)

**...**

**Definitely forty-seven. Trust me. I was awake, you weren’t. No really, go for it. The army pays me by the stitch, I’m making so much money this shift if I have to do them all over again. Hey, if you pop them a third time after that, I’ll split the take with you.**

**...**

**No, you aren’t a prisoner. It’s a silly little design flaw of the hospital - the architects assumed the patients would exit through the open, unlocked door of their room. Not the windows. Please feel free to leave feedback in our patient survey. Hey, do you want a coffee?**

**...**

**I don’t know. I’m drinking a coffee, and it suddenly struck me I’m being rude, drinking one and not offering you any. It’s free. It’s terrible. It’s ill advised since what your body desperately needs right now is rest and sleep. But maybe you want to caffeinate if you’re gonna try to scale the hospital wall after being caught in a shrapnel cloud ward. I mean, the caffeine won’t help you, but at least you’ll be awake when you fall off the building. If you’d prefer to be a little sleepy when you hit the ground, may I suggest a nice lemon ginger tea instead?** 

**...**

**The rest of your unit is fine, soldier. Apparently the only one to get badly hurt was you. Your captain said something about quick thinking, inverting your shield and covering the spell focus point. He was sure it was you, so I guess I believe him, though I’m not seeing a lot of thinking in this room right now.**

**...**

**Yes, it was a shrapnel cloud. Messed you up pretty bad, but nothing we couldn’t fix. Even with your refusal to use magical healing.**

**...**

**Of course we respected that. I put all forty seven damn stitches into you by hand, you ungrateful jerk. Do you know how few medics still know how to do that without magic? You’re lucky I was on shift.**

**...**

**I promise you, per your documented wishes, you have received one hundred percent non-magical healing. If you’re feeling up for climbing out windows, it’s because I’m just that good. You’re welcome. Wait. Is that why you’re trying to leave? You thought we’d used magic on you when you were unconscious?**

**...**

(softening) **Look, before you go climbing out any windows, why don’t you let me change out those bandages, apply a little anti-bacterial? That’s what I came in here to do. Then if you still want to run, maybe I can convince you to make your great escape out the door instead? Which is, I must emphasize again, unlocked.**

**...**

**Thank you. Where would you prefer to sit, bed or chair?**

**...**

**You want to stand? Soldier, you’re a head taller than me, I’m not sure how that’s gonna work...**

**No, wait. Wait, wait, wait. I got it. You stand, fine. Let me just...** (sound of stool dragging across floor) **There we go. This is why they make providers sit on stools, so we can repurpose them for vertical examinations. Here we go. Let’s get this gown open.**

**...**

**Mm. Hm hm hm. Looking pretty good. I guess your little late night walk was good for airflow over these abrasions. Can you give me a gentle twist? ... Yeah, just from your waist, twist to the left until you feel pain. ... No, no that’s good. Now other way. ... All right, good, thank you. So, most of the damage is concentrated in your right arm and your upper torso. Luckily none of the lacerations penetrated to your internal organs, but there’s a few deeper cuts here I want another look at. All right, raise that right arm up for me. Yeah, just like that.**

SFX: Medical tape rips, rustle of fabric.

**Scabbing up nicely, you must have an excellent white blood cell count. Okay, this is looking pretty good. I’m gonna wipe you down with the iodine and rewrap this. You aren’t ticklish, are you?**

**...**

**Well, try to hold still. If you knock me off this stool, I’m calling in, like, the entire orderly squad to strap you down to the bed.**

**...**

**I’m joking, I’m joking. But I’m not joking about those orderlies if you knock me over. Try, uh, try being not ticklish for the next thirty seconds.**

SFX: a small splash. Wiping fabric over skin

**Geez, you weren’t kidding about being ticklish. All right, hold it together soldier. Almost done here. Almost done...**

SFX: Medical tape rip.

**There we go. You can relax now, let me have this arm, retape this in place... Nice fresh bandage... Okay. Done on the right bicep, let’s see this upper chest. ...** (whistle) **Wow, that’s not bad at all.**

**...**

(flustered) **No! I meant your wounds, I did not mean your... general chest area...** 

**...** 

**All right, funny. Very funny. Here I am standing on a step stool for you and this is the treatment I get. Get me written up for harassing a patient.**

SFX: loud medical tape rip

**That did not hurt.** (quieter) **And if it did you deserved it.**

**...**

**I didn’t say anything. Hold still now. Can you place that arm behind your back? Thank you. ... Have you been taking the anti-biotics?** 

**...**

**Good, good. Whatever your issue with magical healing, I’m glad you don’t have a problem with biological medication. Keep taking those pills regularly until I tell you to stop. I’m going to apply a layer of bacitracin now, and re-bandage you up. Might sting a bit. You ready?**

**...**

**Here we go then. Start at the top, work out way down.** 

**...**

**You’re doing good. Try to relax for me here, okay? You ever get a massage before? Just think of this as the weirdest massage you’ve ever received.**

**...**

**Feels good? Glad to hear it.** 

**...**

**Damn right I’m that good. Didn’t I say? Give me another little twist. Just a tiny one to the left. Good. Just getting down to the end here, let me just reach over...Whoa!**

SFX: Squeal of stool on floor.

(Speaker yelps as they start to fall)

**Hey! Let go of me, you idiot! Put me down!**

(Rustle of speaker pulling free and standing)

**...**

**I’m not worried about harm to me, soldier. I’m worried about harm to you. You couldn’t even climb out a window and you think you should be catching me? I don’t need you popping all those stitches! You think they pay me by the stitch here?**

**...**

**I literally just said they paid me by the stitch?** (caught, flustered) **You - I will not be held accountable for the things I have to say to keep my patients from jumping out windows!**

**...**

**No, my patients don’t frequently try to jump out windows to escape me. They’re nice and quiet and do as they’re told and don’t interrupt my three a.m. coffees!**

**Arms up. I’ve got to tape you back together here.** 

...

(suddenly paying attention) **What’s... Hang on. Lift that left arm higher. Even with your right.**

**...**

**You don’t want to lift your left arm for me. You won’t, or you can’t? What’s going on? Why’s your mobility restricted? Did I miss something back there? Another knife wound? Or... Wait...** (putting the pieces together) **No... This injury is something older, isn’t it? Something that didn’t heal right. Because you hate hospitals and magical healing so much?**

**...**

SFX: scrape of stool again, frantic shuffle of footsteps as listener breaks for the window again and speaker lunges after them.

**Hey, whoa whoa whoa!** (breathless as the speaker tries to physically stop listener) **No. No, you are not going out the window. Not unless you take me with you. Come on, sweetheart, talk to me.** 

**....**

**You were magically healed before. But... it went bad?** (sigh) **You got a bad healing. Now that I know that’s there, I can... I can feel it. The posterior spinal fibers of the deltoid are... are clipped, bound too tight to the lip of the scalpula.** (As if disgusted/offended:) **It’s wrong. How have you been living with this for so long?**

**...**

**...**

**No! No, I didn’t mean... I’m so sorry if it sounded like I was blaming you. Clearly your healer screwed up. And I am so sorry for that.** 

**...**

**I know it wasn’t me, I’m still sorry.  For being such an asshole about the magical healing...**

**...**

**No, no, no. This isn’t about me right now. This is about you. What can I do, what do you need from me right now?** 

**...**

**What I would suggest, as your medical provider, is you let me finish bandaging you up. Then you sit and let me take a better look at that shoulder-** 

**...** 

**Easy, there. I swear - by all the gods and by every drop of caffeine in this hospital - I will not attempt any magical healing on you. But I would to like to see if there is anything I can do, without magic, to relieve some of that pain now. It’s up to you. How would you like to proceed?**

**...**

**...**

**Thank you. Will you sit for me please, backwards on the chair here, and lean forward? ... Let’s have a look here.**

**...**

**Muscles are pretty tense all right. You’ve had to compensate for this, huh? Pulled your balance off a bit, had to hyperextend to the right... Any over the counter treatments you’ve used? ... Aspirin, yeah. Heat, good. I’d like to try a little acupressure, and then some heating pads to see if we can’t get you a comfortable night’s sleep at least?**

**...**

**All right. Hang on to that chair back, I’m going to start with these knots along your shoulder. A little pressure here, hold it for eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Right along to... here, I feel that knot. Pressure in, hold it there. Five, four, three, two, one.** 

**...**

**That’s good, you should feel warmth. I’m going to go up and down a bit here, work through this muscle group. Up... and down. Up... and down. Breathe into it. ... Feeling a bit better? ... Can I get you into bed?**

**...**

**Very funny. C’mon soldier. Back to bed. Can you do on your back? I want you laceration side up. We’ll slide the heating pads underneath. Let’s lower you down. (small grunt as the speaker helps the listener lie back)**

**...**

**You don’t have to thank me. You have the right to refuse magical treatment. And I really don’t blame you. Going through a bad healing is a traumatic experience. I’m really sorry that happened to you and again, I’m sorry I gave you shit about refusing magic healing.**

**...**

**Taking you seriously is the least I can do.** (can’t help adding:) **But to be clear, I’m not sorry for razzing you about trying to go out through the window. Please, please, do not try that again or you will be subjected to some truly epic levels of razz. You need to escape, please let me know and I’ll sneak you out in an old lady wig or in a body bag or something.**

**...**

**Sure, really. I'm up shenanigans. Gotta to do something to get through the last ten hours of this shift before I can go home.**

**...**

**Yes. Absolutely. You get some sleep and tomorrow** ***you*** **can sneak** ***me*** **out in an old lady wig or a body bag. Here’s that heating pad, lift up a bit for me? ... All right. Think you’re ready to rest?**

**...**

**Good night, soldier. I’ll see you in the morning for our great escape.**

I have spent thousands of hours doing these things over the years.

The problem is, I don't like going to church and feel like it's a waste of my time when I could be out glorifying God in better ways, really studying the Bible and helping out people in need. I also feel like it serves more of a social function than a God-glorifying function: You toe the line, walk the walk, wear the right clothes, say the right things, don't ask questions or take issue with anything, and always, on your face, wear a smile.

I have been to numerous churches over the years and found many of them to be incredibly problematic or just mind-numbingly boring.

When I tell other Christians I don't go to church, they tell me I'm a bad Christian, or that I can't be a Christian and not go to church. I find this completely farcical, as the Bible says where two or more (not 200 or more) are gathered in My name, I am there with them. I have Christian friends whom I discuss Christianity and personal issues with. Is that not the actual Biblical definition of Church?

To me, a Bible study or a coffee meeting with a fellow Christian brother is the real church—not what goes on in a flashy building where people share silly prayer requests that don't comport with Jesus's definition of how to pray (please help me get a boyfriend, please heal my cat's cancer, please provide me a new car), or flex their social capital by loudly belting out the ""alto"" part of Hymn X.

I'm not alone in this: C.S. Lewis, Leo Tolstoy, Søren Kierkegaard, and surely many others famously had a distaste for church and/or churchgoing, although C.S. Lewis did it out of a sense of duty (which I imagine was driven by social pressure). But that's not okay in Evangelical America: if you're not overflowing with joy about going to Church, you're ""not a real Christian"".

God can be praised in all we do, not just in a robotic manner in a building.

The problems I have with church are numerous.  
\- I find the vibe to come off as shallow. Everyone seems to be trying to one-up each other in terms of dress and presentation, hairstyling, etc.  
\- I severely dislike praise songs. They are repetitive, boring, and musically tepid.  
\- The messages of pastors are often problematic to me. They're either the same repetition of the Gospel message, year after year, or they lack depth and scrutiny. Questions are always arising in my mind, but I don't feel like questions are welcome. I can't imagine a sermon that tells me anything I don't already know.  
\- I have met with numerous pastors over the years and gotten ""counsel"" from them that was iffy. One pastor told me to consult enneagrams about my relationship problems, another gave me some fairly ridiculous advice that was supposed to improve my relationship with a sibling, other pastors have dubiously defended pedophiles while excommunicating teenagers for smoking pot, etc. I just don't really see pastors as sources of wisdom anymore.

So what else IS the Church these days than a place to parade around your Christianity and drink coffee with other Christians?

On top of that, I am an immigrant, I came to this country to study after receiving a scholarship that only covers the tuition. I have been unemployed for 4 months, and the job search has been very tough especially because of my status and the need for an employer to sponsor my visa, so I went back home to live with my unemployed depressed mother. The past 4 months have been super hard and stressful, and I need to go back to the other country in a few days to not lose my visa. I am basically going to the unknown since I don't have accommodation there or a job lined up and may not even be able to renew my visa because of my situation. My friend who is from this country is aware of my situation. I told her that I was coming because I would love to see her, and then she said ""Let's go for dinner on this day. There's a new fancy French restaurant that I have been wanting to try."" She is a very nice and sweet person, but sometimes she's so out of touch or doesn't think that it makes me annoyed. I think it's because she comes from a rich family who bought her a car as soon as she turned 18, and she has a good stable job and life, that she cannot think about money in a position of someone in my situation, as a poor unemployed immigrant. I definitely cannot afford to go to a fancy French restaurant, and she's putting me in the uncomfortable embarrassing situation of making me say that to her.

Some say it has a horrible curry or celery smell. Others say it smells like a heavenly mix between a coffee shop and fresh pancakes. 

But one thing 99% of everyone agrees on is that it is NUCLEAR. I watched a review where a guy said spraying it on a piece of paper made his room smell like it for about a week.  So yea im very curious on what followed by kerosene will be like and I ordered it. Best case scenario it smells like pancakes and breakfast and lasts for weeks and weeks like everyone says.

I’m 34, 5’11”, I live an active lifestyle, a bit nerdy, and can be a bit shy when first meeting people.

In my Vanilla life, I have my life together and work a full time job in Tech. On my free time, I love making art, playing video/board games, planning out travel trips, concerts, and hanging out with friends.

In the bdsm world, I’d love to find a dominant to serve. I love the rituals, giving up controls, and focusing entirely on my partner. I enjoy being caged, love bondage, following directions, pegging, body worship, and humiliation. I’m not into findom and am not interested in pro-dommes. I would like to develop a meaningful relationship with a power dynamic involved. I hope to meet a goddess to serve soon!

I check the gps so check the traffic, find all the coffee spots, all the restaurants, the activities, local events, etc…
My boyfriend drives to my house, and i usually drive us both to the dates and whatnot. He usually pays. I usually offer to pay or to at least cover my half, but he usually insists on paying. 

Ive been telling him for months that i want him to be assertive and plan dates once in a while. He never rlly did and im always doing the planning. The past dates have felt more like hangouts. He never decides where we eat or what we do, it’s always up to me. I told him once in a while i want him to tell me “ill pick you up at 8, put X dress on”, pick me up, and have a date where i dont have to be worried and planning everything. 

He hasnt done it and it’s been over 2 months. Ive been rlly busy and getting depressed, and ive been losing emotional connection to him. He no longer brings me little gifts and no longer shows me that he knows me as a person. 

He has been wanting physical connection, trying to kiss me a lot of hug or cuddle. It feels off tho, im lacking the emotional/romantic connection. 

NOW he says he needs physical connection before emotional and that’s why it’s hard for him to meet my needs. But id been giving him physical touch for so long, he has had 9 months to plan a date for me, but has not a single reservation. 

He wants to make it up to me and keeps saying he will change it (hes been saying it for months). But even if he changes, i feel like it will be because I had to HEAVILY insist and also in order to fulfill his own needs. 

Am i overreacting? Please help.

This article talks about a micro-trend of swedish women embracing their soft girl era. Essentially they are becoming house girlfriends. Quitting their jobs and taking an allowance from their boyfriends. Spending their days going for coffee and doing yoga. 

I believe it is dangerous because:

1. It's sending the wrong message to young girls who are eating this up on social media 

2. It puts these women in a vulnerable position of being financially dependent on a male.

3. It's a major step backwards for women's equality as suggested by Gudrun Schyman (co-founder and former leader of Sweden’s feminist party)

I had this niggling feeling he needed help to get home, and I was right: he kept insisting Dufferin was Caledonia, which, obvs, it is not.

I got us on the right bus to his home, he invited me in, and I sat as he showed me photo albums of his (honestly pretty amazing) life. Like, this dude rocks. But he was so frail the whole time, and I do worry; he mentioned being part of a seniors group (awesome!) but he’s a widower who lives alone (less awesome!), and though he was joking about being found frozen to death because he can’t figure out the bus, he also kinda wasn’t joking?

We exchanged contacts and I’ll keep in touch, but I can’t care for him. As his new friend, I want him to have the best care possible, and of course I’ll check in regularly.

He just shouldn’t have had to roll the dice on a stranger being nice in order to get home safe and sound. I’m honoured he shared his home and his life with me, truly what a gift, but…I’d like to be able to help meaningfully beyond having coffee at his house next week? Which we’re absolutely doing.

Sure both make a living exposing others under the guise of journalism but atleast the MSM doesn't interject themselves into the story.

Listen before you start crucifying me like most do blindly to everyone coffeezilla decides to target think about this, coffee makes no original content he couldn't survive without feeding on the very people he cancels. I know it's so satisfying to watch others more successful fall. It's the great American past time! However, coffeezilla injecting himself not only broke any journalist integrity he may have had, he mostlikely have caused others to lose even more money than they would have.

Anyone who actually follows hype products will tell you weather it's shoes, supreme, baseball cards, stocks or cryptocurrency they all follow the same pattern. Hype drives the price up speculators sell, price goes down, hype fades, price goes down further then if the product survives the price will stabilize and even recover. See, iPhone, ps5, Pokémon, uber ipo, most recently truth social IPO. If after ""truth"" began to fall the SEC made claims the company was a scam it would have dropped more, then more scare would have made more drop out then it might have gone bankrupt. Even with ""rugpulls"" it survived. It is very common for initial investors and those given early releases to products to sell at the initial peak, even the SEC allows that! It's not a scam or illegal for the most part. To be honest I don't even think that happened with Hawk coin. Speculation drove it down following the exact curve almost every ICO/IPO in the past, most can recover! 

Meme coins don't have a regulation agency so for someone like coffeezilla who dubs himself a ""crypto journalist"" that many consider an expert in  the space, to join a call and announce a scam that all but kills the chances for this coin to survive losing all those hodlers the rest of their money.

Full disclosure I have profited and lost on meme coins, selling at the peak shortly after launch. It happens everytime! Its like the rocket game, buy, 1x, 2x, 3x, then 💥 its gone. I like take my  20% and get out! Sorry to those who busted thats Speculating! Those who bought on the way up had the same chances to sell at that peak that as everyone else did but they got greedy.

14 months unexplained secondary infertility. Basal body temped, opk, timed intercourse 12 months. Semen analysis great. 2 months medicated IUI (5mg letrozole, ovidrel trigger) at fertility clinic. 2nd IUI has a BFP, which hasn’t even had a squinter in 13 past months. Taking coq10, fish oil, prenatal, probiotic. 

Day before iui: “cheers” to last glass of wine for 9+ months over nice Italian dinner.

Day of iui: good follicle count felt promising but otherwise neutral/pessimistic since nothing else had worked and so many people talk about IUI being a waste. Very cramps and bloated after. 

DPO 1-7: committed to trying blood sugar regulation: meaning protein before anything sweet. Severely Limited sweets and ate healthy- Only had one coffee in that week- usually daily. Beet root juice daily. I feel not good post ovidrel- peeing 3 times a night, headaches daily. 

DPo 8- feel tired but better than past few days. Feels like ovidrel is out of system. Not peeing as frequently. Did not test. 

DPo 9- moody - very upset about the house not being clean. Watery cm. Feel nauseous. Cancel going to a party I fully intended on going to. Decided I needed to get my nails done NOW after trying to diy for past 6+ months. Back HURT, lower right. Thought I bruised my back somehow.

DPo 10- moody, feel tired & nauseous. Made chicken noodle soup. And bread. Took a nap after an outing and felt like I completely knocked out for 1.5 hours in a DEEP sleep which doesn’t happen often. Sneezed and right ovary HURT. Didn’t want to test yet. But then a bit later my lower abdomen felt HOT, inside. Like my uterus/lower abdomen felt very spicy… not cramps but tingly hot. Immediately was like this is weird… I’m going to test even though it’s 3pm and not FMU - went and test and line is clear and there, but unsure if it’s from ovidrel or real. I told my husband and said - my gut tells me this is real. 

DPo 11- tested. Line +. Looked fainter? But different time of day. Nauseous. Don’t want to eat anything. Things taste weird 

DPo 12- tested. Line clearly darker than 10dpo. Husband finally agrees it’s real and it’s getting darker (so not ovidrel). Nausea ramping up. Back ache, head aches. Boobs hurt. Watery cm. 

DPo 13- tested yep it’s real and it’s getting darker and darker. Nausea back ache tired irritable. Sense of smell - very high. 

DPo 14 - dark test because still convincing myself it’s real. Nausea- diarrhea- headache - constipation - all in a days time. Stay up hours past bedtime sipping tea to calm upset stomach. Beta hcg 160. 

So that’s my story! Still early so not much more to share but know that they are helpful to someone!

1h8ju1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h8ju1p/my_parents_were_never_there_for_me_emotionally/,My parents were never there for me emotionally and I feel like it affects my relationships now as an adult,"For context, I'm asian-south american. My parents and I moved to xx country when I was 2 years old due to work. They are incredibly hardworking people and thanks to them, I was able to get a good education. I'm thankful for that.

However, when it comes to the emotional side, I've realized my parents were never there for me. We have sort of a complicated relationship. My parents don't really speak spanish (my first language) and I'm not super versed in korean. This has put a strain in our relationship, as we don't communicate the way normal families do. I feel like I don't know them much and they don't know me either. They're also not super affectionate people, which doesn't help with this deep feeling of alienation that I feel.

Most of the times we talk about grades. They always expected a lot from me, you know, in typical asian family style. I just hadn't realized until recently that it was pretty much all we talked about. I've never had a deep conversation with any of them. I've had friends tell me excitedly how they told their moms about their new crush or whatever and that concept felt so foreign to me.

They're hypercritical about everything and judgmental, they're always gossiping about everyone.

In typical asian family style, they're also not very knowledgeable in mental health. When I was 5, the school counselor urged my mom to take me to the psychologist due to severe anxiety which turned out to be selective mutism. My parents took me once and decided that I didn't need therapy. I spent 3 years not speaking to a single soul outside of my family circle, and I was left to deal with it alone. I eventually overcame it, but I was left with social anxiety and thinking about it now, I just feel like I lost parts of my childhood because of it, and it makes me sad to think it could've been more normal had I recieved therapy.

My relationship with them is so strained to the point where I never felt safe to talk to them about my issues or ask for help. When I was 7 they left me with a babysitter who was emotionally abusive, extremely religious, would constantly tell me that I'd go to hell for doing things that ordinary toddlers do (like listening to music, watching movies, eating too slowly, etc), etc. I was on edge everytime she was around, because I never knew whether she would be in a good or bad mood, and it stressed me out. I would constantly try to find ways to please her. She'd give me the silent treatment if I did anything that bothered her, and all I wanted was for her to like me. Eventhough I scared of her, I could never bring myself to tell my parents, so she lived with us for five years. And it's not like my parents would've been okay with this behaviour. They would've been mortified if they had known. It's just that I couldn't bring myself to tell them. I didn't want to be a burden. I didn't wanna cause any problems.

When I was bullied, the only response I got from my mother was ""oh"". I was balling my eyes out and that was the only response. We never talked about it again.

I don't like it when colleges offer to buy me coffee. I don't even like when my parents spend their money on my clothes. I always felt guilty for asking for a birthday present.

All of these experiences have made me self isolate. I can make friends, just not deep ones. I feel like I cannot truly connect with anyone.

I think about it a lot these days because I met a guy and he was the greenest green flag that I had ever met. I had never met someone so kind before. He's pretty much the opposite of me. He asked me on a date and eventhough I liked him back, I rejected him due to fear. We talked about it eventually and I was able to open up a bit about my mental health. He understood and I could tell he was putting extra effort to make sure I felt safe. He encouraged me to open up, he said he wanted to understand me. But my brain still makes me feel like I need to push him away. My anxiety is through the roof. I want him and at the same time, my brain tells me to run away. I feel like my childhood has made it impossible for me to enjoy a normal relationship. I just feel so undeserving. I wonder why he even liked me.",1,1733543121.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1)Bedford:  Ah, Bedford, New Hampshire—a town where the traffic on Route 101 is so legendary that it should have its own reality show. You know you’re in Bedford when a simple trip to the store feels like a quest for the Holy Grail, complete with endless delays and the kind of road rage that could fuel a small army. Who needs a theme park when you have the thrill of sitting in gridlock, contemplating your life choices?

Your claim to fame? A community that touts itself as “family-friendly” while simultaneously lacking any parks for kids to actually play in. That’s right—no playgrounds, no swings, just a bunch of snooty, selfish residents who’d rather sip their lattes and complain about the noise from a distant lawnmower than let their kids enjoy a little fresh air. It’s like a suburban utopia where the only thing more exclusive than the country club is the unspoken rule that children should be seen and not heard—preferably in someone else’s backyard.

And let’s talk about The Inside Scoop, the local ice cream joint that’s somehow become a rite of passage for Bedford residents. You’d think a place with such a charming name would serve up something special, but no—prepare yourself for a parade of flavors that taste like they were created by someone who’s never actually tasted ice cream. It’s a place where you can bond with your neighbors over the shared experience of bad ice cream, all while pretending that the long lines are worth it. Because nothing says “community” like standing in line for a scoop of disappointment!

And let’s not forget the sandy politics that run deeper than the local sand traps. Bedford is a place where the rich and snooty gather to discuss their latest home renovations and the merits of organic lawn care, all while looking down their noses at anyone who dares to suggest that maybe, just maybe, a little humility wouldn’t hurt. It’s a town where the biggest scandal is who parked too close to the curb, and the most heated debates revolve around the best way to keep the riffraff out of their pristine neighborhoods.

Bedford, you’re like the town that thinks it’s too good for the rest of New Hampshire, but really, you’re just a collection of overinflated egos and poorly executed desserts. You’ve got the charm of a gated community but the warmth of a frozen treat left out in the sun. But hey, at least you’ve got your traffic jams, your bad ice cream, and your sandy politics to keep things interesting—because nothing screams “thriving community” like a bunch of self-important residents stuck in their cars, rushing to be the first ones to receive that free coffee at Nouria!

2) Manchester: Manchester, New Hampshire—a city that proudly wears its “Queen City” title like a crown, even if it’s a little crooked. You know you’re in Manchester when the most exciting thing on a Saturday night is deciding which dive bar has the best karaoke—because nothing says “thriving metropolis” like belting out ’80s power ballads to a crowd of mildly interested strangers.

Your claim to fame? A vibrant downtown that’s a delightful mix of historic charm and “what were they thinking?” architecture. It’s a place where you can stroll past crumbling buildings and run-down streets that seem to have been forgotten by time—and maybe even the city planners. And let’s not forget the occasional surprise of stepping over a pile of, shall we say, “urban contributions” left by the local wildlife—or, more accurately, the homeless population that’s become a fixture in certain areas. It’s a city where the scenery can shift from charming to alarming in a matter of blocks.

And then there’s the local cuisine, where you can find everything from gourmet restaurants to greasy spoon diners that serve food so good it should come with a warning label. You might think you’re in for a culinary adventure, but be prepared for the reality that the best meal you’ll have is probably a slice of pizza at 2 a.m. after a night out. Because nothing says “fine dining” like a half-eaten slice and a side of regret!

As election season rolls around, the streets become a veritable gallery of political signs, each one more desperate than the last, vying for your attention like a toddler in a candy store. It’s a time when the city’s charm is overshadowed by a cacophony of slogans and promises that seem to multiply overnight, making you wonder if anyone actually reads them or if they’re just there to add to the clutter.

Let’s not forget the local sports scene, where the Fisher Cats battle it out for your attention. It’s a city that loves its teams, even if the biggest excitement is watching the scoreboard and hoping for a miracle. And if you’re not into sports, don’t worry—there’s always the annual “Who Can Avoid Eye Contact the Longest” competition at the local coffee shop, where everyone pretends they’re too busy to chat.

Manchester, you’re like the city that thinks it’s a big deal but is really just a collection of quirky neighborhoods and questionable decisions. You’ve got the charm of a small town with the hustle of a city, but let’s be real: you’re just a little too proud of your “urban” vibe while still holding onto that small-town mentality. But hey, at least you’ve got your dive bars, your run-down streets, your political signs, and your late-night pizza runs to keep things interesting—because nothing screams “thriving city” like a bunch of locals trying to remember where they parked after a night of karaoke!

3) Nashua: Nashua, New Hampshire, is a city that’s like a high school reunion you didn’t ask for—full of familiar faces and a lot of awkward small talk. You know you’re in Nashua when the biggest excitement is the annual “Who Can Avoid the Most Potholes” contest on Main Street. It’s a place where the roads are so bumpy that you might as well be off-roading in a Jeep.

The downtown area has its moments, but it’s also a patchwork of run-down buildings and half-hearted attempts at revitalization. You’ll find a mix of charming shops and vacant storefronts that seem to be in a perpetual state of “coming soon.” And let’s not forget the delightful aroma of “urban adventure” wafting through the air, courtesy of the occasional street vendor and the not-so-occasional reminder that some folks have a different idea of public cleanliness.

As election season rolls around, the streets become a veritable forest of political signs, each one more desperate than the last, cluttering the sidewalks like a bad yard sale. It’s a time when residents are bombarded with slogans and promises, making you wonder if anyone actually believes the hype or if they’re just trying to outdo each other in the “most enthusiastic” category.

Nashua’s dining scene is a mixed bag, where you can find everything from questionable chain restaurants to local joints that serve food with a side of “what were they thinking?” You might find yourself at a diner where the coffee is strong, but the food is a gamble—will it be a culinary delight or a lesson in regret? Spoiler alert: it’s usually the latter.

And let’s not forget the local events, where the biggest excitement might be the annual “Who Can Stand in Line the Longest” competition at the local ice cream shop. Nashua loves its community gatherings, even if they often feel like a thinly veiled excuse for residents to gossip about who’s been spotted at the local bar or who forgot to mow their lawn.

Nashua, you’re like the city that’s trying to find its groove but often ends up stuck in neutral. You’ve got the charm of a small town with aspirations of being a bustling city, but let’s be real: you’re still figuring out how to balance that small-town mentality with the hustle of urban life. But hey, at least you’ve got your political signs, your bumpy roads, and your questionable dining experiences to keep things interesting—because nothing says “thriving city” like a bunch of locals trying to remember where they parked after a night of mediocre fun!

4) Concord: Concord, New Hampshire, is a city that feels like it’s been stuck in a time loop since the early 2000s. You know you’re in Concord when the most exciting thing on a Tuesday night is watching the local news anchor try to make the weather sound thrilling. Spoiler alert: it rarely is.

The traffic? A delightful game of “guess which road is closed today.” You could spend an hour trying to navigate your way through town, only to end up right back where you started, contemplating your life choices and wondering if you should have just walked. It’s a place where rush hour means waiting behind a single school bus and wondering if you’ll ever see the other side of the intersection.

And let’s talk about the political squabbles. Concord is the kind of place where everyone has an opinion, and they’re more than happy to share it—preferably at the coffee shop, where the barista is just trying to make a living while dodging debates about the latest town council meeting. It’s a city where political signs sprout up like weeds every election season, each one more desperate than the last, as if they’re trying to outdo each other in a contest of who can promise the most while delivering the least.

The local economy? Let’s just say it’s a charming mix of outdated shops and businesses that seem to have missed the memo about the internet. You might find a bookstore that still sells VHS tapes or a diner that proudly serves “retro” meals that haven’t been trendy since the Reagan administration. It’s a place where nostalgia reigns supreme, and the only thing fresher than the air is the sarcasm.

Concord, you’re like that friend who insists they’re still “in their prime” while sporting a wardrobe that hasn’t changed since high school. You’ve got the charm of a small town with the ambition of a city, but let’s be real: you’re still trying to figure out how to make that work. But hey, at least you’ve got your traffic jams, your political debates, and your outdated shops to keep things interesting—because nothing says “thriving city” like a bunch of locals reminiscing about the good old days while stuck in a never-ending loop of mediocrity!

5) Portsmouth, New Hampshire, is like that charming friend who always seems to be having a good time, but you can’t quite figure out why. You know you’re in Portsmouth when the streets are lined with historic buildings that look like they’ve been plucked straight from a postcard, yet the prices for a cup of coffee could make you question your life choices.

The waterfront is picturesque, sure, but good luck finding a spot to sit without being photobombed by a seagull or a tourist who thinks they’re in a travel magazine. It’s a city that thrives on its own charm, but sometimes that charm feels a little too polished, like a shiny apple that’s been sitting on the shelf for too long.

Dining in Portsmouth is an adventure, where you can find everything from upscale seafood restaurants to quirky little bistros that serve dishes with names so pretentious you’ll need a dictionary to understand the menu. You might pay top dollar for a plate that looks like it was designed for Instagram rather than actual consumption. And if you’re looking for a late-night bite, good luck! Most places close up early, leaving you to ponder your dinner choices while staring longingly at the “Closed” signs.

The local arts scene is vibrant, but it often feels like a competition to see who can be the most avant-garde. You might find yourself at a gallery opening where the art is so abstract that you’re left wondering if the artist just threw paint at the canvas and called it a day. But hey, at least there’s free wine!

Portsmouth, you’re like the city that’s trying to be the life of the party but sometimes ends up being the one everyone politely nods at while looking for the exit. You’ve got the charm of a coastal town with the hustle of a tourist destination, but let’s be real: you’re still figuring out how to balance the two. But hey, at least you’ve got your beautiful waterfront, your quirky dining options, and your artsy vibe to keep things interesting—because nothing says “thriving city” like a bunch of locals trying to enjoy their overpriced lobster rolls while dodging seagulls!

6) Ah, Keene, New Hampshire—where excitement goes to take a nap. This charming little town is the epitome of “if you blink, you might miss it.” Seriously, if you’re looking for thrills, you might want to check the calendar for the next town meeting. That’s where the real action is, folks!

Let’s talk about the weather. Keene experiences all four seasons, which is great if you enjoy the idea of winter lasting for half the year. The snow piles up like it’s auditioning for a role in a winter wonderland movie, and the locals? They’ve turned hibernation into an art form. You’ll find them bundled up like they’re preparing for an Arctic expedition, sipping hot cocoa while reminiscing about the days when they could actually see the ground. Spring is just a cruel tease before summer rolls in with humidity that makes you feel like you’re walking through soup.

And nightlife? Oh boy, hold onto your hats! If you’re hoping for a vibrant scene, you might as well head to the nearest library. Keene’s idea of a wild night is gathering at a coffee shop to discuss the latest town gossip or attending a lecture on the history of the region. The most thrilling event on the calendar is the annual Pumpkin Festival, or the lack of it rather, where residents used to compete to carve the best jack-o’-lantern, very riveting by the way, before nutheads decided to ruin the day! Maybe they were bored? In Keene, you can practically hear the excitement in the air—if you listen closely, that is.

Let’s not forget the culinary scene. Keene boasts a variety of dining options, but if you’re expecting Michelin-starred meals, you’re in for a rude awakening. The local restaurants serve up the same tired fare: burgers, fries, and the occasional “exotic” dish that’s about as adventurous as a bowl of plain oatmeal. If you’re a foodie, you might want to bring your own spices and a sense of adventure—or just settle for a bag of chips.

In conclusion, Keene, NH, is a town that prides itself on its small-town charm, but sometimes that charm feels more like a quaint façade hiding a lack of excitement. It’s a place where the pace of life is slow, the weather is unpredictable, and the nightlife is practically nonexistent. But hey, if you’re looking for a peaceful retreat where you can enjoy the simple pleasures of life—like watching paint dry—then Keene might just be the perfect spot for you. Just don’t forget to bring a good book and a sense of humor!

As you can tell from the title, I bake weekly for dnd- and yes, I am aware of how lucky all of us are to have our schedules match up every week (especially since we are in university)!

I've been baking for around 8-9 years now, but mostly do the same 10ish recipes that my families love, rarely making anything new. Now, as our group has been playing dnd since the beginning of the semester and therefore have had about a dozen sessions now, I'm clear out of recipes! I've looked for some but I really don't know what baked goods are popular or well loved aside from the staples that I've already made (cookies, cake pops, pretzels, etc).

It needs to be something not requiring silverware (although I have broken this rule once by bringing coffee cake lol, so I guess I'd just prefer this) and have a recipe that a college student can do (am willing to spend up to like 6-7 hrs for a single recipe).

 My daughter wanted to make deviled eggs. MIL got her the ingredients. My daughter boils them and puts them in the fridge to finish the next morning. Morning comes. I wake up to go get my coffee. She's peeling eggs. I ask if she's making potato salad. She says no, I'm making deviled eggs. I say But my daughter wanted to make them. She says, ""Well, she's not up yet so I'm making them.""
So hubby and I go to wake up our daughter. Walk her to the kitchen and stands by MIL to get the eggs back. MIL tells her she's making the eggs. I get mad and snatch the bowl away from her and place them on the counter. MIL gets mad and says something like ""That's fucked up!"" I wasn't paying attention bc of how angry i felt. My daughter is crying. I tell the hubby, we're going to my dad's. We'll be there the rest of the day. He says OK, I don't want to deal with her shit today. We all leave. 
The weekend comes, MIL comes home,  packs up and was gone the rest of the weekend. She came back on Monday morning,  then she stayed in her room for 2 days only coming out for food or cigarette break. She's very slowly coming back out and trying to make small talk like nothing happened.
( I'm cautious, however, bc I've seen all this before. I've been with my hubby since 2008, so I know her movements. )
Finally, tonight my hubby tells her to apologize to my daughter. I hear her say that she was just trying to help. Then she goes to apologize . 
My daughter informed me that she said she was sorry even though it wasn't her fault. She was just trying to help. She blamed the whole incident on me.

1h8jnhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/eComEnclave/comments/1h8jnhe/turn_a_1999_matcha_package_into_a_lifetime/,Turn a $19.99 Matcha Package Into a Lifetime Customer—Here’s How,"Matcha is up 7.9% since 2020.

[Matcha Interest Over Time](https://preview.redd.it/2rkd5xrajc5e1.jpg?width=2248&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03aa6378ac9ed01f6e4c6fb05fd9685147184089)

With more people growing health conscious, Matcha is replacing Coffee.

* → It regulates your energy 
* → It's full of antioxidants 
* → It's not addictive

And it's incredibly easy to sell yourself...

# Step 1- Find a manufacturer

Search ""Matcha"" on Thomasnet.

These are the top suppliers in the U.S.

[Matcha Supplier in US](https://preview.redd.it/6y5404bgjc5e1.jpg?width=2986&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=642c350c7ceff7d57f1f7b993d1de13281219932)

Find the ones with the best prices, order samples, and choose the best quality.

# Step 2- Build your matcha brand

First, decide on the vibe you want:

* → Fun 
* → Luxury 
* → Healthy

All of these Matcha brands are boring...

[Matcha Supplier in US](https://preview.redd.it/moramlohjc5e1.jpg?width=2422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=321d0bb1580c62e993f79b28df0a5f360e80bc7f)

Go to namelix or Dall-E 2 and use keywords to create a brand with a unique aesthetic.

Here's a good example of this...

[Spacegoods Chocolate Powder Mushroom Coffee](https://preview.redd.it/u9pshrwijc5e1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0e99a900885f99a49ecf3496686ac58c4481cce)

This brand sells mushroom coffee.

But instead of selling boring, brown and green packaging like everyone else...

Their ""space vibe"" makes them stand out.

# Step 3- Identify keyword opportunities

For this, just use [https://Helium10.com](https://honeysyed.com/helium10)

Search ""Matcha"" on Amazon and start looking through the similar keywords.

[Matcha Amazon Keyword Opportunities](https://preview.redd.it/5sajrrtmjc5e1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b3d1a15bce2a0f58c5b7803dd4e5db4d86d8554)

Find one with 10,000+ monthly searches and blast this on your listing and ads.

# Step 4- Add a subscription option

People buy coffee over and over again...

* → Offer 1 package for $19.99 
* → Offer monthly packages for $15.99

If your product is good, you'll have customers for life by using this method.

# Step 5- Target a specific niche

I wouldn't just sell ""Matcha Lattes""

I would target a niche like businessmen.

Explain how Matcha prevents coffee crashes, allowing for better workouts, brain function, and making more money.

Here's another good example...

[Black Rifle Coffee Company](https://preview.redd.it/0chsd7hqjc5e1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=024b811422097979023e21d6bab7707d0e8fef5d)

Black Rifle just sells basic coffee.

But, they made millions by selling to a very specific male audience and tailoring their messaging, designs, etc to them.

This is how to market a boring product.

Other things I see say otherwise.  

I was diagnosed with a kidney infection in the beginning of October.  I was given antibiotics for 26 days before the doctor told me there was no bacteria found in the culture they did.

I had stabbing pains in my groin, abdomen, and sides of my lower back, like needles going through my insides.  It wasn't all the time, but every day, every 10-20 minutes.  

I quit the antibiotics and after a week felt mostly better, then for two weeks I felt basically completely better, now, for over a week my body feels sick.  You know when you have a viral illness and your body feels sick?  That was me for a week with no other symptoms.  Until 3-4 days ago when the stabbing pains came back.  The initial stabbing pain actually began while I was having a bowel movement.  I was straining and my lower right side of my back started hurting.

Thought it would go away but it just progressed.  Now it's both sides of my back, my groin, and my abdomen.

My abdomen has hurt to the touch too since early October.

I was constipated for like a month and a half (pooping very very VERY little every 3-4 days) before I started drinking coffee and apple juice, then I started going almost every day again.  

I had a massive bowel movement in mid October, like, honestly massive, since then, my stool is always super thin now (it was when I was constipated too) and lighter in color, and a lot of undigested stuff, also sometimes one little piece will be encapsulated in mucus, and just recently I had a streak of blood in my stool.  

This morning I woke up with SEVERE stomach cramps.

I'm nauseous after eating.  I ate a very small amount just a bit ago and it made my lower right side hurt a lot.  

I do not know what to do.  I am traveling abroad in 4 days.  

Should I wait until then to see the doctor so it will be cheaper in case I need surgery?

Should I take miralax?

1h8jkf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardflaccidresearch/comments/1h8jkf9/how_i_fixed_my_hard_flaccid_completely/,How I fixed my Hard Flaccid Completely,"#**If you suspect that your Hard Flaccid is related to tight pelvic floor for any reason, this may help you.**

##If you:

-get worse when you poop
-get worse when you stand
-get better momentarily at times that seem random
-have my other symptoms listed below

...then you should read this through, trust me. 

For the past 18-20 months my pelvic floor has been incredibly tight, causing me many problems in my life, problems that basically changed my view of myself, my relationship to my body, and the world. Ya this sounds a bit dramatic but I just want to suggest that I know how serious and subjectively intense pelvic floor problems can be for someone. I know how hard flaccid can ruin your life, both mentally and physically.

For me, it would sometimes improve and sometimes not. I would notice my HF being very tight some days or for weeks/months at a time and then randomly I would notice improvement and then once again I would see and feel more HF get worse and it felt like, no matter what I did, such as focus on diet, training, no caffeine, stretching, meditation, hormone control through good habits, reducing cortisol, etc., none of it worked; perhaps momentarily I would get relief, but it would always come back.

It was like chasing a ghost, without going into too much detail it really messed me up mentally, like I couldn’t really be myself. It was constantly on my mind because nothing I was doing was working and because I would sometimes improve and then immediately stop. I went on vacation, for example, and the whole vacation I had normal bowels movements — something that would never happen under normal circumstances for me — and my pelvic floor was relaxed quite often and my HF not showing up much. I thought maybe I had a cortisol problem, or I was eating different , etc. I could have coffee which I was unable to do before then. After the vacation, I slowly returned to normal pelvic floor tightness and HF. Bad bowel movements, couldn’t have coffee. I was lost, basically hopeless. I couldn’t pinpoint the problem for me for basically 2 years.

Here’s what I figured out:
#**Symptoms** 
I realized that my hard flaccid/pelvic floor gets worse when:

I’m standing
I’m sitting in certain positions
I’m working out
I’m stressed
My heart is racing
Sometimes when I just had a bowel movement
I smoke weed
It improved when:

I sat in certain other positions
I lean on something with my upperbody while standing
I lay down for a while
When I stretch in certain positions
I stood with my hips forward and my hands clasped behind my head
When I bent over as if to stretch my hamstrings
This is what I had to work with, and after thinking for a few days and doing a lot of research I found that I had something called swayback posture.




#**I ONLY HAD TO CHANGE ONE MINOR THING TO IMPROVE EVERYTHING.**

I can’t really believe I’m saying this, but all I had to do stand up tall, with my chest up, head level/straight and neck more aligned with my spine, my shoulders pulled back as if firmly pushing my chest up and out, with my hands at my side with palms facing in toward my body, toes pointing straight out and aligned with my hips. I stood up liked this, and after moving my hips around enough and feeling my joints somewhat stacked, breathing with my diaphragm and not over straining anything, I vaguely noticed a kind of release and lightness in my pelvic floor. Almost like I wasn’t even noticing it was there, and I experience the sensation of relaxing the pelvic floor; it’s almost as if it’s not there, or light, invisible; in others words stress free and not tensed.

So all this to basically say:


#**I JUST HAD TO STAND UP STRAIGHT??????**

So that’s it, that’s how I fixed my pelvic floor tightness. I’ve been doing this for almost three weeks and it has fixed me. I no longer have problems (although I still stretch to make sure I have a healthy pelvic floor). It’s also partly a muscle weakness thing so I’m more focusing on lower body and back and cores workouts to make things easier on my pelvic floor all around, because it deserves a break for having to basically support my non-stacked upperbody for a couple years.

Look up a picture of the natural shape of the spine, it will help you see how you should position your spine when standing; for me it felt awkward at first because it felt like I was hyperextending but no, it just feels weird because I haven’t really stood normal and tall for a long time. You should feel almost overly confident when standing.

I felt the changes on the first day standing like this, and after three weeks things are just getting better and better, improving and improving.

My problem was simply posture, it was the root of all my problems.

Please share these ideas with people who might need them if you can. I hope this simple trick can save just one more person from one more day of feeling how I felt for those 2 years.

(Sorry for the post being so long, I felt the backstory might help someone relate)

Reminder to stand up straight, Chest up, shoulder back, relax the belly, relaxed breathing, and feel your back stack onto your hips and relaxing, relieving pressure on your pelvic floor. If there are questions I can address how I stand and how it feels. I have to set my hips back a little farther than I realized as well, so experiment yourself with how you position your hips, just make sure you aren't pushing them too far forward. You should feel a release or lightness in your pelvic floor when it relaxes. **If not, just keep standup up and tall with your chest up and out and shoulders back for a while** and see if it helps. MY hard flaccid is cured. I can masturbate multiple days in a row now (after not being able to more than once every couple weeks. I can smoke weed, I can do basically everything normally now.",3,1733542220.0,hardflaccidresearch,0,1.0,False

1h8jhna,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h8jhna/advice_needed/,Advice Needed,"Hi Reddit,

I need some advice because I feel like im in a good position to make a successful move on a girl that has caught my eye for a while. I don’t know what my next move should be as I rarely do stuff like this since im focused on myself and career but I dont want to mess this up .

Context- there is a girl working at a local cafe that I live going to for a while now because of their amazing coffee and atmosphere, I usually go once a week and that is how I met this girl. So for the last 2 months ive been going routinely on the weekends and being served by this girl, its now gotten to the point where she knows my name, there’s always a smile when I enter and approach the register. There is that look (maybe in delusional) like this look I’ve never got before like she is focused what I have to say and there is constant eye contact when im being served and after when my order is being prepared. 

Sometimes i will look to see if she does to other people since she is probably just doing her job but no I know it is different with me. This one time there were two people at the registers and she shifted towards the registers closer to me and I just gave my order to her. 

So one day at my university I thought I saw her in the same building, so the next time I went and I asked her if she went to the same university and she was excited to say yh I do. I explained to her that i work and study there and I thought i saw you blah blah. Anyway we shared information about what degrees we studied and I finally got her name since I asked because she knows my name and I don’t know hers.


The issue - because we are a close community, i have a good relationship with the co owner, some of the staff from football so if i make a move and it fails it will be very awkward going to the cafe moving forward and also how embarrassing it would be for me. She is like 2-3 years younger than me i think and i wont be attending uni as ill be doing the remainder online and uni has finished for the year so I cant use that as an excuse. 

I usually dont approach girls at work/shops/ uni because i would hate for them to feel uncomfortable and for me to look like a creep. My whole life ive just never had the guts to tell people whilst my friends would shamelessly approach and get other peoples social media. 

I have a lot more confidence because im finishing my studies, gotten fitter and smarter so im confident that if given the opportunity I could shine my maturity and personality which i think are my strengths apart from being a full time comedian. 

So I wanted to get your opinions, maybe the females could help out?",1,1733541955.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1h8jfxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/1h8jfxt/severe_duty_backpack_recommendations/,Severe Duty Backpack Recommendations,"Hello r/backpacks,

I'm in the market for a severe-duty pack for work. I’m a field mechanic in the Canadian Arctic, and I’ve gone through two backpacks since May: a strap tore on my Ful, and the zippers broke on my Dewalt.

I'm happy to spend whatever it takes, as long as the pack is well-built. The Wolf Pak Meal Management 35L is the only one I've liked so far, but at $309 CAD + shipping, taxes, and customs, it feels a bit risky for the price.

**What I need:**

* **A separate food compartment – I work in greasy conditions and need to keep food separate from everything else.**
* Two large side pockets – Ideally not elastic mesh.
* Must be water-resistant or waterproof.
* Durable zippers that can withstand tough conditions.
* (Optional) PPE/glove/winter gear compartment – This will likely get greasy.

**Things I carry at all times:**

* NOCO GB40 Booster/Power Pack
* LG Boom Bluetooth speaker
* Spare AAA, 18650, and M12 batteries
* Microsoft Surface Pro tablet
* Hand cream, sanitizer, wipes, lip balm, etc.
* 1.5L water bottle + travel coffee mug
* 3-5 little containers of food and cutlery.

**Things I didn’t like about previous backpacks:**

* Tool backpacks with too many small pockets – I don’t need that many tiny slots.
* The Dewalt pack had too many additional small compartments.
* Having just one large compartment where I stored food and other items, which got greasy.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!",1,1733541790.0,backpacks,1,1.0,False

I plugged the exit shoot the first week. It stalled the motor with grounds clogged in the grinder. I don't mean blow it out and move forward it was completely plugged. It needed a complete removal and clean out. 

Grinding dark roast, expected, but not this bad.  Called and returned. Was getting decent shots. 2.5 pounds seasoning. I would have kept it if it was easier to clean out. Did not do marker test to check burrs. Did zero it out espresso was around 15+-

Moved to DF64V Gen 2. Magnetic shoot easy clean???? I received an open box and should have returned it, but I wanted an espresso in the morning. 

The DF64V  has been a nightmare, too. Piss poor espresso and stalled the machine at 1400RPMs. Hot start - slow feed, and it stopped. The burrs I did do a maker test, but I could hear wobble on them. It felt like the shaft was bent. This may explain the issue. I was getting bad espresso. Also needed to grind around 40+ to get anything close to 30 seconds. Bad grinder

  
Some good and bad.....

DF64V Gen 2

I like the size and the dial. If the shaft had not been bent, the build on the DF64V could have been solid. The variable motor is a weak spot, too. I found the RPMs moving up and down as the grinder was grinding. Remember, learning to drive and not understanding the gas pedal. Yes, the DF64V is still learning to grind. I wanted it to work, but it is getting returned too. 

DF64  v2 I liked the espresso. Its motor did not have any issue until it plugged.  I blame the dark roast. The dial could be better. After a few days of use, I could see the dial was showing wear. 

I did a sound test with a Decibel app on my phone. I found them about the same level. Compared to my  Sette 270 I did not find them loud. On the cheap test, they both hit 85 decibels. The results could also be I have been running my Sette for the last 4 years nothing sounds loud to me. What did you say could you speak up Lol....

FYI on sound, I did a towel and mouse pad under the machine. The mouse pad won on sounding better. 

Called MiiCoffee, and he said to wait for the CF64V. Done the rabbit hole

I like the specs and think the vertical burrs are the way to go. The motor is 400 watts.

This could be worth waiting for if I win the DF Lottery.

Me and my best friend (for the purpose of this story we will call her Amanda) have know each other for about a year, we clicked immediately and became best friends after like a month of being friends, they say when u know u know. We spend almost 90% of your free time together, doing absolutely everything together from shopping, watching movies, going out, going to lunches, dinners, sleping over, we are even coworks and spend all our breaks together. Amanda is really kind and sweet but she has trust issues since she has been cheated on and lied to in her past. So after about 11 months of being attached to the hip she found out I lied to her. Yes I know it wasn't a good move but context of me lying is important so please read to the end till you judge. I have been friends with this one guy (lets call him Ben, btw also our coworker) for much longer time, I have known him for about 8 months before we (me and Amanda) even met. Ben has always been a great friend to me who helped me with a lot of hardships in my life and when I  was desperately looking for a job he got me an interview at the company he worked at. And since we were involved (friends with benefitsmaybe more who know haha) he made me promise him I would never tell anyone in the company since it was forbidden within the company to have any kind of relationships. I promised him that and never said a word about it. This is were the problem lies, cause I did say something. About half a year ago one of our coworkers (let's call her Kate) also one of my good friends resigned. We were still going out for coffees and gossiping as u know girls do. And that's when I told her about Ben, that I really liked him and have had this 'friends with benefits' kind of relationship. Kate understood why I haven't told her and we began to talk a loot about it since she had a similar story. Few months go by and somehow Kate comes back to our company. So now there is one person in the company who knows about me and Ben. I apologizes to Ben with saying that I had no idea she would come back, he understood and was okay with it since Kate promised me she would never say anything. Well as u can guess this is were the sh*t began.  Amanda, Ben and many others went for a 3 week work trip, all of them were housed in one hotel as it usually is at work trips. Kate and I stayed back because of personal reasons. In the middle of their work trip truly angry message comes to me from Amanda, saying that she is truly disappointed in me and she can't belive i could break her trust like this and lie to her about Ben. She asked me about him in the past if we ever had anything togther and i said no. Amanda also told me that everybody says they already knew (btw I nor Ben have any idea how others could know since we haven't told anyone except Kate). I told her that i have only told Kate and nobody else. That made Amanda even more p*ssed at me cause she was told that many other knew and pressumed i was lying even more to make cover my butt. She stopped responding to me and but still read everything i wrote, so I wrote her an apology message (might i add i am truly proud of myself for that message how nicely i was able to word it). And nothing for weeks. Now she comes back and we meet at the office, nothing. So i write her this hand written letter explaining all my and Bens past hoping it would help. No no, it made her even more mad, she wrote me a message saying she doesn't want to have anything to do with me and she doesn't care about my sh*tty past. I was heart broken. Might i add she has not one spoken to me eye to eye even though i was begging for it. Another week goes by and i decide not to give up and sent her flowers with a note i am sorry and please tell me what can i do. Nothing. Another week goes by i sent her flowers and again a handwritten letter asking her to tell me what can i do or to tell me there is no chance. Again. Nothing. She is so mad at me won't even look at me and avoids me like the plague in work. It has been a over a month since she stopped talking to me, I have been trying.

","Hey team. I was hoping for some help, I feel like I'm at a dead end (again).

I've been suffering with symptoms of low T for about 3+ years now. (lack of libido, low energy, brain fog, loss of muscle mass and difficulty recovering from workouts). 

I began getting tested 3 years ago and can confirm I have low levels (the results for the last 2 years are in the table attached). 

A little bit about me: 

* 38-year-old male based in New Zealand. Slim build. 78 kg (171 pounds) 6FT tall. 
* I workout 6 days a week (yoga, BJJ, some resistance training and cardio) 
* Diet is mostly animal protein, fruit, nuts, and vegetables. I do eat chocolate and crap from time to time but it's mostly clean. 
* Minimal alcohol & caffeine.  No drugs or smoking. 
* I supplement colloidal minerals, multivitamins, collagen, Vitamin D, creatine and amino acids.
* I've tried Boron, zinc and cutting out things from my diet that may impact SHBG (e.g oleic acid & coffee) but it's stayed consistently high. 
* I get 9 hours of sleep a night. I was diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea. 
* 3 months on CPAP with no improvement in T or SHBG. I underwent throat surgery and now sleep on my side to mitigate symptoms.
* I  started Tongkat Ali, Fagodia Agrestis about 2 months ago, and did a phlebotomy 6 weeks ago. I saw my LH double and a 38% increase in free testosterone (mostly from the Fagodia Agrestis I think).
* I suspected my ferritin was the cause of high SHBG but donating blood only moved the needle slightly. I will donate again next month and see if it improves 
* I recently did a fertility test and froze some healthy sperm 
* I do have some chronic inflammation from back problems stemming from a congenital issue with my hips and sitting at a desk all day (working on this) 
* I don't take any medication other than ibuprofen about twice a week as needed 

**I've been to 5 endocrinologists in total and two general practitioners.** 

The first endo (in Europe) **prescribed me TRT, HCG, and anastrozole** a year ago (I haven't taken it but I still have about a 9months supply of all the meds).

4 of the other endos in NZ have pretty much said, 'you have enough total testosterone, you are in the reference range. SHBG and free T are quite individualistic things, everyone is different bla bla'.  
  
After many visits, my GP prescribed me **Testosterone Transdermal Gel**  (20.25mg per pump) and recommended 2 pumps a day. 

I am currently at a loss. Now that I am at 743 ng/dL of total test (2.07 free) I feel a bit better with some libido returning and a clear improvement in workout recovery. 

I feel like if I can get the SHBG down somehow I won't need to go on the testosterone.  
  
I've tried pretty much everything I can find without using a pharmaceutical. (I'm not against using pharmaceuticals but I just wanted to try every other avenue before pulling those levers).  
  
I can't find any good help from the medical professionals here. 

Does anyone have any thoughts about the next steps? 

* Should I keep focusing on the SHBG number and figuring out why it's high and what I can do about it?
   * I've heard of things like anastrozole monotherapy to get E2 and potentially SHBG numbers down, could this be a good step?
   * I've also heard Peter Attea say he would prescribe low-dose Oxandrolone (Anavar) to help bind some of the SHBG 
* Should I try the T gel or jabs and see how my symptoms improve? 
* Should I further boost my T with HCG monotherapy? 
* Any other avenues to explore like online health professionals? 

Any thoughts, opinions or guidance would be great, sorry for the long post, if I missed any info or blood test results that may be relevant let me know and I'm happy to update the post. Thank you!

The dive bar bathroom smelled like a mix of beer-soaked wood and overused cleaning chemicals that couldn’t quite mask the underlying stench. I leaned against the chipped sink, scrolling through my phone, killing time while waiting for my turn to use the stall. That’s when I noticed it.

It was scratched into the wall beside the mirror in jagged, uneven letters: “*People Knob*,” followed by a phone number. The handwriting was chaotic, like it had been carved in a hurry, but the words were oddly precise.

I chuckled under my breath. Drunken graffiti was a staple of places like this, but this one had a strange charm.

I snapped a picture of it and sent it to the group chat I had with my friends, captioning it: *“Found some quality poetry tonight.”*

The replies were instant: *“What does it even mean?” “Drunk people are wild.” “Bet it’s a sex line. Call it, Peter.”*

I laughed and tucked my phone back in my pocket. Yeah, no thanks. I had no interest in whatever prank or scam waited on the other end of that number. It was probably a hotline for weirdos who got off on creeping out random people.

When I finally got home later that night, I looked at the picture again. “*People Knob*.” What a bizarre phrase. Who even thinks to write something like that?

\* \* \* \* \* \*

A week later, I saw it again.

This time, it was at a trendy café downtown. I was washing my hands in their sleek, modern bathroom, the kind with motion-sensor everything, when I spotted it etched faintly into the metal edge of the paper towel dispenser. The same sloppy handwriting, and the same phone number.

I froze, staring at it. The déjà vu hit me hard. My brain tried to rationalize it. Maybe the same prankster had been here. Maybe it was some urban scavenger hunt or guerrilla marketing campaign.

But why “*People Knob*”? It wasn’t clever or catchy. It was just… *weird*.

I shook it off and returned to my table, but the encounter stuck with me.

Over the next week, I saw the phrase in more places. A park bench near my office. A bus stop on my commute. Once, even scratched faintly into the wood of a restaurant booth where I was having dinner with coworkers. The graffiti definitely wasn’t confined to seedy places—and it was spreading.

At first, I ignored it. That is, until I started to feel like it was following me.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

Two weeks after my first encounter, I decided to give in to curiosity.

I was at home, scrolling through my photos, when I came across the picture I’d taken in the dive bar. My thumb hovered over the phone number. Rationally, I knew better. Calling random numbers scrawled on bathroom walls wasn’t something normal people did. But the sheer repetition of it had me on edge. What was it? A joke? A secret? Or something else entirely?

I reasoned with myself that it was probably some bored teenager having fun. I’d call, laugh at the nonsense, and put this whole thing to rest.

Before I could second-guess myself, I hit the call button.

The line connected, but no one spoke.

For a moment, there was nothing but silence, and then there were... *sounds*.

Sloshing. Gurgling. Wet, visceral noises that made my skin crawl. I blinked, confused. Was it a bad connection? Some kind of strange audio file? I'd hardly had time to consider all the possibilities when, faintly, in the background, I heard what sounded like muffled screaming.

My stomach turned. I gripped the phone tighter, trying to make sense of what I was hearing. The sounds weren’t static. They were deliberate and organic. Whatever was happening on the other end of the line was deeply wrong—and sounded very, *very* real.

“Hello?” I said, my voice cracking slightly.

No answer. Just the wet, squelching noises and tortured screams.

I hung up, my heart racing.

For a few minutes, I just sat there, staring at my phone, trying to process what had just happened. Maybe it was a prank—some kind of sick joke. But the screams, they sounded genuine.

I tried not to think about it. I shoved my phone into my pocket, turned on the TV, and drowned the memory in sitcom reruns.

I barely had time to relax when my phone buzzed, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.

I peered at my screen and swallowed hard. I gasped when I realized it was the same number. The one I had just called—and it was calling me back.

Against my better judgment, I answered, my hands trembling slightly.

The same noises poured into my ear: slurping and squelching, and now, accompanying it, a bizarre mechanical whirring. It sounded something like a grinder or a machine chewing through something. Beyond the din, I heard more screaming, this time louder and more desperate.

“Who is this?!” I shouted, panic overtaking me.

I received no response, but it was clear now that someone on the other line was listening. I could hear them breathing—heavy, labored inhalations that filled the silence between the grotesque sounds.

I couldn’t take it anymore. “I’m calling the police, you sick freak!” I yelled, smashing the “end call” button.

I blocked the number and tossed the phone onto the couch.

That night, for the first time in years, I double-checked that all my doors and windows were locked.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I didn’t sleep. Even after making sure that the locks on my doors and windows were functional, I didn't feel safe. Instead, I felt like I was being watched. I had no reason to believe that the owner of the number knew where I lived, and yet, I couldn't relax. The call had rattled me more than I wanted to admit. Those sounds—wet, organic, and punctuated by screaming—played on repeat in my mind. I told myself again it was a harmless prank meant to freak me out—but my gut told me otherwise.

The next morning, still groggy from lack of sleep, I decided to report the calls. It felt ridiculous walking into the police station to explain what had happened, but it seemed like the right thing to do, under the circumstances. I’d spent the drive there rehearsing what I’d say, trying to make it sound as normal as possible.

The desk officer looked unimpressed as I laid it all out. “You called a number scratched on a bathroom wall, and they… made noises at you?” He quirked an eyebrow.

I cleared my throat. “It wasn’t just noises. It sounded like someone was screaming. And there was this… machine sound. It wasn’t *normal*.”

The officer leaned back in his chair, stifling a yawn. “Look, unless they threatened you or you’ve got proof of a crime, there’s not much we can do. Probably just some pervert having a laugh. Block the number and move on.”

I felt a spark of irritation flare. “So, if this person is hurting someone—like the screaming I heard—you’re just going to ignore it?”

He gave me a look that said he was done humoring me. “We get weird calls reported all the time. If it happens again, record it and bring that in. But for now, I suggest you let it go.”

I walked out of the station, fuming. Let it go? Sure, I’d just forget the horrifying sounds and the way my stomach dropped when the number called back. The cops clearly weren’t going to help.

That night, my friends and I decided to hit up a new bar downtown. I figured a few drinks and some good company would be enough to distract me from the unsettling events of the past few days. By the time we arrived, I was already a couple of beers in, feeling the edge of my anxiety dull.

The place was crowded and lively, with dim lighting and music loud enough to vibrate the walls. My friends and I grabbed a corner booth, ordering drinks and shouting over the noise to catch up on everyone’s week.

“Still freaked out about that creepy phone call?” my friend Kyle asked, leaning across the table.

I shrugged, not wanting to get into it. “Blocked the number. Haven’t heard anything since.”

“See?” he said with a grin. “Problem solved. You just gotta quit being such a magnet for weird stuff.”

I forced a laugh, but my unease lingered.

After a while, the drinks caught up to me, and I excused myself to find the bathroom. The hallway leading there was narrow and lined with framed vintage posters. The bathroom itself was what you’d expect—grimy tile, flickering fluorescent lights, and a stall door that didn’t quite close all the way.

I stepped into the stall and sighed, leaning against the wall as I did my business. That’s when I heard it.

Someone entered the stall next to mine, their footsteps heavy. There was something unusual about the way they moved, accompanied by a dragging sound that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

Then came the noises. Wet, slurping sounds, like someone sucking the marrow from a bone. My chest tightened as I recognized the sounds from the phone calls. What were the odds?

I froze, straining to hear. I had to be *sure*.

As I listened, the noises grew louder and more grotesque. A faint, rhythmic gulping, like something viscous being stirred and then swallowed.

I couldn’t breathe. My mind raced with panic, screaming at me to get out. I zipped up and stumbled out of the stall, barely registering the flickering lights overhead.

I burst back into the main bar area, overwhelmed by the urge to flee the building. I didn’t care if I sounded insane. “Guys!” I said, grabbing Kyle’s arm. “Someone’s in the bathroom! It’s… it’s the same thing from the calls.”

My friends exchanged glances, clearly skeptical. “What are you talking about?” Kyle asked, frowning.

“I’m not joking!” I hissed. “Just—just come look!”

They followed me, laughing nervously as we made our way back to the bathroom. I pushed open the door, fully expecting to see someone—or *something*—waiting inside.

It was empty. The bathroom was empty. There were no dragging footsteps and no wet noises, just the faint hum of flickering fluorescent lights—and me, looking like an absolute fool.

My friends groaned in frustration. “Dude, you’ve had *way* too much to drink,” Kyle said, shaking his head.

“Wait!” I said, pointing to the stall I’d been in. The words “*People Knob*” were freshly etched into the metal door, the jagged letters standing out starkly against the smoothly polished surface.

“What the hell?” one of my friends muttered, leaning in for a closer look.

Kyle snorted. “So someone’s been tagging bathrooms. Big deal.”

“It wasn’t here when I walked in!” I snapped, my voice rising. “I swear to God, something’s going on!”

Kyle rolled his eyes. “Fine. Let’s see how funny this ‘pervert’ thinks they are.” He whipped out his phone and dialed the number before I could stop him.

“No! What are you doing, Kyle?” I shouted. “Are you crazy?” I grabbed for his phone, but he held it out of reach. “You don’t get it—now they’ll have your number too!”

Kyle laughed. “Relax, man. They’re probably some loser, living in their mom's basement. I’ll give ‘em a piece of my mind.”

He held the phone to his ear. A moment later, we heard the line connect—and then his grin faded. His expression shifted from amused to confused, then to something else entirely. *Fear*.

“What is it, Kyle?” I asked, dread pooling in my stomach.

His voice was barely a whisper. “They… they want to talk to you, Peter.”

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I didn’t speak to Kyle for the rest of the night. I barely even said goodbye to my friends as I bolted out of the bar. The words *“they want to talk to you”* played on a loop in my head, growing louder with each repetition until I felt like my skull would split.

The streets blurred past me as I power-walked toward home, sweat slicking my palms. The city lights offered no comfort. Each shadow, every passing stranger, felt sinister.

When I reached my apartment building, I froze at the sight of my door.

It was ajar.

I stood there for a moment, rooted in place. Had I forgotten to lock it? No, I remembered doing it before I left. My gut twisted as I opened the door, wincing at the creak of the hinges.

The living room looked normal—*too* normal. My laptop was still on the coffee table, the half-empty bag of chips from earlier in the day untouched. Nothing seemed out of place, and yet the air felt heavy.

Grabbing the largest kitchen knife I owned, I began a slow, deliberate sweep of the apartment. My breath caught in my throat as I checked the closets, under the bed, and behind the shower curtain. Everything was as it should be.

Everything, that is, except the bathroom.

When I turned the light on, I nearly dropped the knife.

There it was—*“People Knob”—*scratched into the tile above the sink, the same message that had haunted me for days. The jagged letters glared back at me, meticulously scrawled in identical handwriting.

I stumbled back. This wasn’t just a prank. Someone had been in my apartment—someone who knew *exactly* what they were doing.

I didn’t waste another second. I bolted out of the building, knife still in hand, and called my best friend, Jake, begging to crash on his couch for the night.

Jake didn’t ask many questions. He’d always been the kind of guy who didn’t pry, which was one of the reasons I trusted him. I gave him the short version—someone had broken into my apartment and left a creepy message. He nodded grimly, offering me a blanket and a beer.

The next morning, after calling my landlord and leaving them a voicemail explaining why I was leaving, I packed a bag and drove to my parents’ house. I couldn’t face going back to the apartment, not yet. My mom fussed over me the way she always did, offering coffee and concerned questions. My dad was quieter, his frown deep and contemplative as I explained the situation.

“This some kind of stalker, you think?” he asked finally.

“I don’t know,” I replied. “The police didn’t take it seriously the first time, and now…” I trailed off, unsure of how to explain the gravity of what had happened.

My parents did their best to make me feel secure. For the first time in days, I felt like I could breathe again. The isolation of the house—the way it sat back from the road, surrounded by tall trees—felt like a buffer between me and whatever was happening.

By the second night, I even managed to sleep.

The illusion of safety didn’t last.

It was my mom’s cell phone that rang first. We were sitting in the kitchen, sipping coffee and talking about mundane things, when she picked it up.

Her face clouded with confusion as she looked at the screen. “It’s for you,” she said, holding the phone out to me.

I stared at her, my blood turning to ice. “What do you mean, it’s for me?”

“I don’t know,” she said, frowning. “I just… feel like it’s meant for you.”

My hands shook as I took the phone from her. “Hello?”

The line was silent for a moment. Then, the familiar noises began. Slurping, squelching, and the faint hum of a machine grinding in the background. Farther back, quiet but still audible, were the muffled screams.

I hung up immediately, my chest heaving. The phone dropped from my hand onto the kitchen table.

“What is it?” my mom asked, alarmed.

“It’s *them*,” I whispered. “They… they followed me here.”

After that, I knew I couldn’t stay at my parents’ house any longer. Whatever this was, it wasn’t going to stop. It didn’t matter where I went*—*and the last thing I wanted was for my parents to get involved, or worse, hurt.

My landlord called me back the next day, promising to change the locks and install security cameras. The police assured me they’d patrol the area. Reluctantly, I agreed to return to the apartment.

When I arrived, the building seemed quieter than usual. My neighbors’ doors were all shut tight, and the hallways were silent except for the faint hum of the overhead lights.

I unlocked the door, half-expecting the graffiti to still be on the bathroom wall, but everything looked pristine. The landlord had done a thorough job cleaning up. I spotted several new cameras on the way in. Everything looked good, so far.

I let out a shaky breath and dropped my bag onto the couch. For the first time in days, I felt a sliver of hope. Maybe it was over. Maybe I could start piecing my life back together.

Then I noticed a voicemail notification on my phone.

It was from my landlord, timestamped about thirty minutes before I arrived. Somehow I had missed it.

I pressed play, holding the phone to my ear.

“Peter, it’s Jim,” the message began, his voice trembling. “Listen, I was reviewing the security footage from the night of the break-in, and… look, I don’t know how to say this, but whatever went into your apartment that night—it never left. It’s still in there. I’m on my way with the police. Don’t go inside. Whatever you do, don’t—”

The message cut off.

I stood there, frozen. Jim’s message hadn’t even had time to register yet by the time a sound reached me from the bedroom.

It was faint at first, but as I listened, it grew louder. A wet, scraping noise, punctuated by the rhythmic thud of heavy footsteps.

They were getting closer.

I didn’t even grab my bag. I bolted out the door and sprinted down the street. I didn’t stop running until I was blocks away and my legs gave out.

My lungs felt as if they were on fire by the time I collapsed on a bench near a 24-hour diner. I gulped down air, glancing over my shoulder like a hunted animal. Every shadow on the sidewalk, every car passing by, felt like a threat.

Jim’s voicemail replayed in my mind, his panicked words echoing over the sound of those dragging footsteps. Whatever went into my apartment that night—it never left.

I never went back to my apartment again.

By the time my landlord and the police arrived, I was already gone, sitting in Jake’s living room, shaking as I tried to explain what had happened. Jake didn’t interrupt, and for once, he didn’t even crack a joke. When I finished, he sat in stunned silence.

“Man… you’re not going back there, are you?” he finally asked.

I shook my head vehemently. “No. I’m done. I’m not going back, not when he—*it*—knows where I live.”

And I meant it. Whatever I left behind—clothes, furniture, even my laptop—it wasn’t worth my trouble, or my life.

Jake offered to let me crash at his place for a while, but I knew that wasn’t an option. I didn’t want whatever *it* was to follow me there, too.

I spent the next week at a cheap motel on the edge of town, paying in cash and keeping my phone turned off except to check for updates from the landlord and the cops. Each night, I triple-checked the locks on the door and windows, slept with the lights on, and tucked a knife under my pillow.

The landlord called twice. The first time, he left a voicemail saying the apartment was empty when they arrived. According to him, there was no sign of forced entry. No signs of anyone—or anything—inside. I couldn’t help but scoff.

The second time, he didn’t leave a message.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I left town the following weekend. I packed what little I could fit into my car and drove until the city was a distant memory.

I settled in a small town a few states away, a quiet place where nobody knew my name. I found a job at a local hardware store and rented a modest room above an elderly couple’s garage. For a while, I began to believe I could move on.

Unfortunately, as it turns out, the damage was already done.

I still see it sometimes.

Not the thing itself—thank God—but the aftermath. Little signs that remind me that it’s still out there. A phrase scrawled on a wall in an unfamiliar handwriting. A phone number scratched into the edge of a table at a diner.

Once, I swore I caught a glimpse of the words *“People Knob”* on a sticky note stuck to the inside of a bus shelter.

I never take the bus anymore.

Perhaps I’m just lucky, but the calls have stopped. I changed my number, disconnected my old phone, and started over with a new device. And so far, I’ve managed to avoid any strange voicemails or late-night calls.

The fear, however, still lingers.

The nightmares are the worst.

In them, I’m back in my old apartment. The walls are covered in the words *“People Knob,”* carved so deeply that the plaster is flaking off. Wet, gurgling sounds fill the air, punctuated by agonized screams that seem to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.

In the dream, I know I should run, but my legs refuse to move. Something approaches me, its footsteps slow and deliberate, dragging heavily across the floor.

I always wake up before I see it.

I don’t talk about it much anymore. Jake’s the only person who knows the full story, and even he avoids bringing it up. It’s easier that way, pretending like it never happened.

But sometimes, when I see jagged handwriting etched into a random bathroom stall or a graffiti-covered wall, I wonder how many other people have called the number—*that* number.

And I wonder… how many others got [out](https://www.creepypastastories.com/staff/craig-groshek/) [alive?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeQEgqIQpY)",8,1733540981.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

“Ready?” Soren asks, and he pushes out his lip in a way that makes his cigarette tilt upwards. Its little stream of smoke twists through the sycamore leaves above his head and mingles with the greying sky. I know he’s offering me half.

I follow the pale swirls with my eyes. The clouds absorb them swiftly, gone within a second— or maybe two. I haven't been so good with time recently. 

Soren takes the cigarette away from his lips and flicks the burnt part off with his thumb. He holds it away from himself in a way that tells me he's not going to take another drag, but he doesn't pass it over. He just looks at me with his uncanny blue eyes. Sometimes he makes me feel like he's staring right into me, instead of at me. It's worse now that he lines the rims with black. 

“Give it here, then,” I say, and he does just that. Our fingers meet as he passes it over. He lets it linger, for a moment, and then he withdraws his hand in one smooth movement, like he doesn't know that I’m thinking of sprinting into the woods.

I bring it to my lips, and his own mouth quirks at the corners as he watches. It burns, from the root of my tongue to the depths of my chest, like one of those spiky black caterpillars had decided to inch its way down my throat and spin a cocoon in my lungs.

I stepped on one of those, in old Ms. Bennett's garden. It was the summer I turned eight, and she spent an hour plucking the spines out with her silver tweezers. I wouldn't walk barefooted after that. I think she noticed all my tip-toeing through the grass, because one morning she called me outside through the kitchen window. Her squinty brown eye lilted even further closed as she led me to one of the lavender patches on either side of her gate. 

*Look, Angie,* she said, and there it was. It was a strange little thing, orange and white with a coffee grind body. But the strangest thing to me was its eyes. They were the most brilliant blue I'd ever seen, like four little circles of the sky had been cut out and woven into its wings.

*Remember that horrid little creature from the other day?* I nodded solemnly, because that's how it is when you're eight. *Well, this is who he grew up to be.* Mr Butterfly seemed to flutter his wings in agreement. 

Ms. Bennett told me, years ago, that they hatch in July. She didn't get to see them this year. 

“We don't have to go in. Not if you don't want.” Soren’s voice is even, and his face bare.

An awful, ungodly stench struck Charlie the moment he opened the creaking front door of the nearly abandoned apartment complex. He winced, reflexively jerking his face away from the entryway so that his lungs might find new air. The thief’s chest audibly rattled as he voraciously sucked in the atmosphere outside the doorway, hand still gripping the brass doorknob. Curious, Theo leaned into the building, inhaling a sample of the escaping vapors. With a chastising shake of his head, he exhaled, chuckling as he did. The younger of the two thieves ducked under Charlie’s arm and pushed forward, seizing the opportunity emasculate his colleague’s fragile sensibilities - teasing him for being so dumbstruck by an aroma. However, Theo’s chronic sinusitis had diminished his sense of smell, unbeknownst to his older colleague. So, despite Theo being able to detect the potent aroma, it was unable to restrain him like it did Charlie.

Theo admired Charlie as a mentor and felt a hint of jealousy towards him, so he found satisfaction in having something to hold over his head. His untimely demise in one of these flats would prevent Theo from ever disclosing this admiration.

“*C’mon now, old man. No time to stop and smell the roses,*” Theo mocked, now leisurely strolling down the narrow, dimly lit lobby.

He wanted to move himself along, imaging himself running ahead to overtake Theo. But Charlie could not force his body through the partition and further into the corrosive scent, the intensity of which continued to increase as more stale air poured from the dilapidated building. Charlie struggled to identify what exactly could produce such a foul odor. It was acrid and gamey, reminiscent of meat spoiled in the summer sun; but at the same time, it also had a metallic and artificial quality, similar to the inside of a bustling factory. Stagnant, putrefied water closely resembled the stench, he considered, but it didn’t quite match.

Instead of following Theo in, Charlie raised a defiant middle finger as he bent over to retrieve the Vicks Vaporub from his backpack. From somewhere further down the hallway, he heard his partner flippantly squawk about Charlie’s feminine constitution. As he listened to the continued goading, Charlie could not fathom how Theo had developed such a bravado. The man was nearly as broke as he him, he had no girlfriend, and he carted around a body shaped like a neglected pear, one that had sat in the fruit bowl for a few too many days - rotting and sagging in all the wrong places. With Theo somehow *still* chattering on, Charlie sighed and smeared the waxy material over the crest of his upper lip as a barrier against the assaulting odor.

He wasn’t much better in comparison, though, Charlie lamented to himself. Gaunt and skeletal, he stood at a monstrous six foot seven inches. Though potentially commanding, his great height was offset by a total absence of muscle. Last time he checked, his weight clocked in at just shy of one hundred and twenty pounds. If Theo resembled a decaying pear, Charlie embodied an anemic popsicle stick. Perhaps, he mused, he and Theo were actually a perfect match - both objects that had well outlived their usefulness and only truly belonged at the heart of a landfill.

He at least possessed some companionship, he reflected, however meager it may be. Charlie could not stand the notion of being truly, utterly alone. He had grown to avoid it at all costs.

Protected from the disabling scent, Charlie took a beat to more thoroughly survey the street. Not that there was that much to see. The area was completely deserted and dilapidated, devoid of any sign of human habitation. That wasn’t always the case, though. Lutzwater boulevard used to represent the cornerstone of the city’s downtown, with this apartment complex acting as the linchpin that held it all together. Charlie relocated from the suburbs to the city at age ten, and could remember well the awe that the street’s opulence and glamour inspired when he rode his bike past with friends. A lot can change in thirty years, though. What remained was a mere shadow of what this place had once been. The many competing taverns and night clubs closed, the rowhomes that once contained up-and-coming senators and actors were derelict, and Lutzwater Heights, the nexus of it all, was almost empty. Only the son of the original owners, Christian, still resided inside, at least according to Theo’s contact.

Charlie didn’t let his eyes linger on any one part of Lutzwater boulevard for too long. The destruction was just too depressing, and in a certain sense, symbolic - the beauty of life and the promise of abundance in childhood turning to ash and shit as he aged.

One tiny piece of the deteriorating scenery, however, did strike Charlie in a way that gave him pause - it was something he had never noticed before. At its peak, Lutzwater Heights showcased an immaculately groomed front garden. Ochre and lavender flowers lined the entrance, greeting longtime residents, guests, and prospective residents of the prestigious building with an equal enthusiasm. Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. Close to his location at the stoop of the building, on the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that he did not recognize. He rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during his youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now. The object’s presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been *even more* out of place when the location was at its prime. Now, it was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a pillory or a telephone booth sprouting out of the garden would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it couldn’t have been new. To Charlie, that was infinitely more incomprehensible.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke his trance and reoriented Charlie to his current purpose on Lutzwater boulevard; Christian Lutzwater and his theoretical wealth. With information passed along from another career criminal, Theo believed there was a fortune hidden somewhere in the bubbling carcass of what *used* to be Lutzwater Heights, despite his parent’s real estate ventures going up in financial flames after their abrupt and cryptic disappearance over two decades ago.

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*, Charlie thought, zipping his bag and placing the Vaporub in his coat pocket, assuming correctly that he would need to reapply the wax a few more times during their scheduled security system consultation/covert casing of the building and their target. Before following Theo into Lutzwater Heights, he rummaged through his wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their so-called business venture. Without looking away from the inside of his wallet, he stood up and began to pace towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from his big toe and radiated through his foot. Not paying attention, Charlie had slammed his boot into the well’s hard stone mid-stride. Apparently, he had misjudged his distance between the stoop, himself, and the well. Charlie felt sure that it had been a meter away, at least it had been before he started searching for coins, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with his previous assessment.

Apparently, the well was practically next to him.

Absentmindedly, he tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as he did, pain and confusion had sidetracked his intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, his mind was instead dragged back to its more fundamental concern as he provided the well with its tithe.

With his subconscious behind the wheel, Charlie wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the coins were swallowed by the blackness, the well instantly began to exude the ungodly odor, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Charlie didn’t understand what had changed, but he the let vapors propel him into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo. As he entered Lutzwater Heights, Charlie thought he heard the metal clink against the well’s bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound he heard wasn’t exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering emanated from somewhere in the darkness, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\----------------------------------------------

***Two:***

Christian Lutzwater looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless, the resulting creases injecting a deep gloom into every facial expression he could manifest. By Theo’s estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty. Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building’s largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, the thieves watched as Christian humbly brewed them a pot of coffee. As he did, Charlie clandestinely scanned the area, determining where they could install a remote camera or two when he wasn’t paying attention.

*“So…where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways…?* Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being an employee at Charlie’s security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, occasionally giving the impression to their soon-to-be victims that he ran the company or that security was a family business he grew up in. In actuality, Theo didn’t know the first thing about installing security systems. Yet, his self-assured manner brought the trust of their targets more often than it didn’t.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off the his part in the robberies while wearing the uniform Charlie stole for him, he happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. From Charlie’s perspective, why mess with a good thing just to feed his ego?

The operation was both clever and profitable. The thieves would steal from their marks a few days *prior* to installing the purchased security systems, which helped them avoid suspicion. It was a simple and easy to execute plan: they would attend consultations with their marks, confirm that they had valuable belongings and no preexisting security measures, and then they would strike. The marks suspected their wealth needed better monitoring - that’s why they had reached out to Charlie’s company in the first place, so it was no surprise when a burglary actually came to pass. After many of their targets were robbed, their only lingering regret was that they had not called Theo and Charlie sooner, as they imagined a security system may have been able to prevent the financial losses.

*“There are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot, ""* Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*“I need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.”*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian’s answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to Charlie for help.

*“…I’m not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, Mr. Lutzwater.”* Charlie mumbled, who was also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Who the hell would try to enter the complex through the fucking sewers?*

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on Charlie, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn’t know what he wanted. He was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some a blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state. Only after a short time did Mr. Lutzwater grasp that his request could be seen as outlandish to anyone unaware of what writhed within his apartment complex.

Without breaking eye contact with Charlie, he slowly conjured a synthetic grin to his face, the corners of his mouth seemingly held up and in position by imperceptible marionette strings.

*“Of course, the entrance will need to be monitored as well. I mentioned the sewer grates first because we’ve had local children spraying graffiti on those areas - seems like I can’t get it off my mind,”* he replied, following the statement with a mechanical chuckle and a sip of his coffee.

Feeling like the flow of conversation was back on track, Theo eagerly returned to the fold.

*“You sure you don’t want a camera for your apartment, too? Can never be too safe with gangs of delinquents roaming the streets,”* Theo proclaimed with a toothy smile.

*“Oh, I don’t live here, young man. I visit the property daily to make sure everything is still somewhat maintained, but I…but I certainly don’t sleep here.”*

A subtle tremor of fear creeped into Christian’s voice when he implied he would *never* spend the night at Lutzwater Heights. Not only did the prospect of sleeping here scare him, but it appeared like he believed he said something that he should not have. He abruptly shifted the conversation to finalizing his order. After signing the agreement, he excused himself to the restroom, allowing Charlie the opportunity to plant a small camera into the kitchen’s smoke detector.

*“Okay gentleman,”* Christian proclaimed as he returned from the bathroom, sitting down across from Charlie as he did, *“I believe we have negotiated the first part of the deal…”*

“*What other parts are there, sir?”* Charlie interjected. Mr. Lutzwater had already signed and paid for the security system. The older thief turned to his left, looking to see if his younger compatriot understood what Christian meant. But he was not at the table. Charlie darted his head wildly around its axis, trying to locate where Theo had gotten off to. Just moments before, he’d been beside Charlie, yet there had been no sounds of a chair scraping or Theo’s footsteps to suggest he’d left the table while he was briefly distracted by Mr. Lutzwater’s return.

When Charlie’s gaze found its way back to Christian, terror bloomed thick and ravenous deep within his chest. His pulse quickened, blood vibrating ferociously through his entire body. He blinked over and over again, but the image in front of him did not change.

Without warning, Mr. Lutzwater’s face has evolved into something else entirely.

*“You know what I mean, Charlie. How many times have we had this conversation? I need your answer. I need your answer now.”*

The phrase seeped listlessly out of one Christian’s new cavities. All of his facial features had been replaced by three oval slits, overflowing with impenetrable, inky darkness. Two vertical slits run parallel to each other over the top two-thirds of his skull, with one horizontal slit laying flatly under the both of them on the bottom third. The steel-blue skin in between the holes was smooth and blemishless, but it appeared dangerously taut, like a plastic bag that had been filled to brim and was primed to split and rupture at any moment - or, maybe, that tightness had already caused the skin to break, resulting in the three slits that were currently staring at him.

Charlie’s aching psyche interpreted the slits as a face, but they looked just as much like the holes in a power outlet as they did two long eyes and one even longer mouth. Yes, language had come from it, but the words had not emanated from his so-called ""mouth"". Instead, the statement leaked out of what Charlie assumed was Christian’s new left eye, causing the crevasse to widen slightly and tremble as it did.

*“You made your request - a cure for loneliness. That is something we can provide, but at a cost. We will want the first of your bloodline, as payment for our generosity.”*

*“I…I…”* Charlie blubbered.

In response to his indecision, all three slits began to ripple soundlessly, like a frustrated scream imperceptible to Charlie was being unleashed from all three orifices simultaneously.

Every night since the consultation, he had experienced the same nightmare. It always started as a memory, a replaying of events, but inevitably culminated with Christian’s transformation. But this was first one where he had actually answered the question. All the times before, the vision ended before he had made a decision.

For the remaining three days prior to the heist, Charlie’s sleep would be barren and nightmareless, but it would not be restful.

In that last nightmare, he agreed to the terms.

\------------

Each day, Theo checked the hidden camera’s recorded feed. In doing so, he determined that there may be something valuable secretly stored within the third-floor suite. In addition, he had confirmed that no one else currently lived inside Lutzwater Heights. No room had been rented out for at least half a decade.

Christian was not lying when he claimed that he visited the premises daily. Every day, about an hour before sundown like clockwork, Mr. Lutzwater would enter the apartment. Without wasting a second, he would pace over urgently to a painting on the wall. He would pull it aside, revealing that it was connected to the wall on a hinge. Because of the camera’s position, it was impossible to discern what lay beyond the painting; the camera’s angle hid that view. However, Christian very clearly took a key that hung around his neck, inserted it into something on the wall, and then reached in to the wall. To Theo, that meant there must be cash, jewelry, or something similarly worth our trouble concealed in that space.

Charlie squinted at the footage proudly displayed by Theo from his old and well-worn laptop. Something caught his eye that the younger thief had neglected to mention.

His lips were moving.

*“Who do you think he’s talking to?”* Charlie asked, praying that Theo had a good explanation.

*“Oh…uh…he’s probably on a call. Bluetooth or something,”* Theo replied while scratching the side of his head, clearly unbothered by the finding.

*“Hm. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.”* Charlie halfheartedly remarked, lying mostly to himself in that moment. There was no evidence to back-up Theo’s deduction. Christian didn’t appear to have ear buds in, nor did he ever take out a phone to indicate he was taking a call, and whenever he was in that apartment, his lips were *always* moving.

But the camera never caught anyone else in that apartment, Charlie told himself.

Theo must be right.

THT post: I heard “yucking my yum” on this podcast and thought it was such a gentle way to diffuse a rude interaction. I deployed it in this situation and I’m getting gutted on the AITAH sub for it 🥲


I (29F) got coffee with my friend Angel (29F). She ordered a mocha, but received a matcha by accident (I’m surprised this doesn’t happen more often I didn’t realize how similar they sound). While they were remaking her drink, they offered her the matcha and she said oh gross no matcha is disgusting and I can’t believe people would choose to drink something that tastes like grass and then threw in the body move to signal yuck (finger point to mouth, tongue out, gagging). I was embarrassed by her reaction which is very odd because Angel is very active in being politically correct and I’m not so much (always publicly reprimands me for trying my dam-nest to use the updated word for unhoused/ unsheltered/ individuals experiencing homelessness, but I guess I’m always 1 word behind). So then the first stupid thought that came to me was that she’s totally pranking me and I laughed and said “oh my you had me there I was like this is a strong reaction to some matcha” and I freaking laughed. 

She responded that this was not a joke and that matcha is “fucking nasty”. Shocked by her reaction, I just said I love matcha (they make it sweet here so that’s why I didn’t take it) and I know it’s not for everyone, but I feel awkward that you’re making it seem like it’s uncivilized to drink it. I feel like you’re yucking my yum. She then said that I was calling her a racist and the barista and I made eye contact and it took me a minute to respond because I wasn’t calling her a racist but once she said that I did feel like maybe her reaction did have notes of it I guess, but it doesn’t adequately sum up  how I felt about the situation. I’m also white and not sure if that constitutes as racism? 

It took me a minute to response, I couldn’t even find words I was so confused  and so she just left and immediately told our friend group about it and everyone is saying I’m the asshole. But the barista said my friend is a nightmare. So, am I the asshole? ",10,1733540642.0,TwoHotTakes,24,0.73,False

An awful, ungodly stench struck Charlie the moment he opened the creaking front door of the nearly abandoned apartment complex. He winced, reflexively jerking his face away from the entryway so that his lungs might find new air. The thief’s chest audibly rattled as he voraciously sucked in the atmosphere outside the doorway, hand still gripping the brass doorknob. Curious, Theo leaned into the building, inhaling a sample of the escaping vapors. With a chastising shake of his head, he exhaled, chuckling as he did. The younger of the two thieves ducked under Charlie’s arm and pushed forward, seizing the opportunity emasculate his colleague’s fragile sensibilities - teasing him for being so dumbstruck by an aroma. However, Theo’s chronic sinusitis had diminished his sense of smell, unbeknownst to his older colleague. So, despite Theo being able to detect the potent aroma, it was unable to restrain him like it did Charlie.

Theo admired Charlie as a mentor and felt a hint of jealousy towards him, so he found satisfaction in having something to hold over his head. His untimely demise in one of these flats would prevent Theo from ever disclosing this admiration.

“*C’mon now, old man. No time to stop and smell the roses,*” Theo mocked, now leisurely strolling down the narrow, dimly lit lobby.

He wanted to move himself along, imaging himself running ahead to overtake Theo. But Charlie could not force his body through the partition and further into the corrosive scent, the intensity of which continued to increase as more stale air poured from the dilapidated building. Charlie struggled to identify what exactly could produce such a foul odor. It was acrid and gamey, reminiscent of meat spoiled in the summer sun; but at the same time, it also had a metallic and artificial quality, similar to the inside of a bustling factory. Stagnant, putrefied water closely resembled the stench, he considered, but it didn’t quite match.

Instead of following Theo in, Charlie raised a defiant middle finger as he bent over to retrieve the Vicks Vaporub from his backpack. From somewhere further down the hallway, he heard his partner flippantly squawk about Charlie’s feminine constitution. As he listened to the continued goading, Charlie could not fathom how Theo had developed such a bravado. The man was nearly as broke as he him, he had no girlfriend, and he carted around a body shaped like a neglected pear, one that had sat in the fruit bowl for a few too many days - rotting and sagging in all the wrong places. With Theo somehow *still* chattering on, Charlie sighed and smeared the waxy material over the crest of his upper lip as a barrier against the assaulting odor.

He wasn’t much better in comparison, though, Charlie lamented to himself. Gaunt and skeletal, he stood at a monstrous six foot seven inches. Though potentially commanding, his great height was offset by a total absence of muscle. Last time he checked, his weight clocked in at just shy of one hundred and twenty pounds. If Theo resembled a decaying pear, Charlie embodied an anemic popsicle stick. Perhaps, he mused, he and Theo were actually a perfect match - both objects that had well outlived their usefulness and only truly belonged at the heart of a landfill.

He at least possessed some companionship, he reflected, however meager it may be. Charlie could not stand the notion of being truly, utterly alone. He had grown to avoid it at all costs.

Protected from the disabling scent, Charlie took a beat to more thoroughly survey the street. Not that there was that much to see. The area was completely deserted and dilapidated, devoid of any sign of human habitation. That wasn’t always the case, though. Lutzwater boulevard used to represent the cornerstone of the city’s downtown, with this apartment complex acting as the linchpin that held it all together. Charlie relocated from the suburbs to the city at age ten, and could remember well the awe that the street’s opulence and glamour inspired when he rode his bike past with friends. A lot can change in thirty years, though. What remained was a mere shadow of what this place had once been. The many competing taverns and night clubs closed, the rowhomes that once contained up-and-coming senators and actors were derelict, and Lutzwater Heights, the nexus of it all, was almost empty. Only the son of the original owners, Christian, still resided inside, at least according to Theo’s contact.

Charlie didn’t let his eyes linger on any one part of Lutzwater boulevard for too long. The destruction was just too depressing, and in a certain sense, symbolic - the beauty of life and the promise of abundance in childhood turning to ash and shit as he aged.

One tiny piece of the deteriorating scenery, however, did strike Charlie in a way that gave him pause - it was something he had never noticed before. At its peak, Lutzwater Heights showcased an immaculately groomed front garden. Ochre and lavender flowers lined the entrance, greeting longtime residents, guests, and prospective residents of the prestigious building with an equal enthusiasm. Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. Close to his location at the stoop of the building, on the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that he did not recognize. He rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during his youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now. The object’s presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been *even more* out of place when the location was at its prime. Now, it was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a pillory or a telephone booth sprouting out of the garden would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it couldn’t have been new. To Charlie, that was infinitely more incomprehensible.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke his trance and reoriented Charlie to his current purpose on Lutzwater boulevard; Christian Lutzwater and his theoretical wealth. With information passed along from another career criminal, Theo believed there was a fortune hidden somewhere in the bubbling carcass of what *used* to be Lutzwater Heights, despite his parent’s real estate ventures going up in financial flames after their abrupt and cryptic disappearance over two decades ago.

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*, Charlie thought, zipping his bag and placing the Vaporub in his coat pocket, assuming correctly that he would need to reapply the wax a few more times during their scheduled security system consultation/covert casing of the building and their target. Before following Theo into Lutzwater Heights, he rummaged through his wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their so-called business venture. Without looking away from the inside of his wallet, he stood up and began to pace towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from his big toe and radiated through his foot. Not paying attention, Charlie had slammed his boot into the well’s hard stone mid-stride. Apparently, he had misjudged his distance between the stoop, himself, and the well. Charlie felt sure that it had been a meter away, at least it had been before he started searching for coins, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with his previous assessment.

Apparently, the well was practically next to him.

Absentmindedly, he tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as he did, pain and confusion had sidetracked his intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, his mind was instead dragged back to its more fundamental concern as he provided the well with its tithe.

With his subconscious behind the wheel, Charlie wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the coins were swallowed by the blackness, the well instantly began to exude the ungodly odor, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Charlie didn’t understand what had changed, but he the let vapors propel him into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo. As he entered Lutzwater Heights, Charlie thought he heard the metal clink against the well’s bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound he heard wasn’t exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering emanated from somewhere in the darkness, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\----------------------------------------------

***Two:***

Christian Lutzwater looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless, the resulting creases injecting a deep gloom into every facial expression he could manifest. By Theo’s estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty. Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building’s largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, the thieves watched as Christian humbly brewed them a pot of coffee. As he did, Charlie clandestinely scanned the area, determining where they could install a remote camera or two when he wasn’t paying attention.

*“So…where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways…?* Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being an employee at Charlie’s security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, occasionally giving the impression to their soon-to-be victims that he ran the company or that security was a family business he grew up in. In actuality, Theo didn’t know the first thing about installing security systems. Yet, his self-assured manner brought the trust of their targets more often than it didn’t.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off the his part in the robberies while wearing the uniform Charlie stole for him, he happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. From Charlie’s perspective, why mess with a good thing just to feed his ego?

The operation was both clever and profitable. The thieves would steal from their marks a few days *prior* to installing the purchased security systems, which helped them avoid suspicion. It was a simple and easy to execute plan: they would attend consultations with their marks, confirm that they had valuable belongings and no preexisting security measures, and then they would strike. The marks suspected their wealth needed better monitoring - that’s why they had reached out to Charlie’s company in the first place, so it was no surprise when a burglary actually came to pass. After many of their targets were robbed, their only lingering regret was that they had not called Theo and Charlie sooner, as they imagined a security system may have been able to prevent the financial losses.

*“There are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot, ""* Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*“I need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.”*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian’s answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to Charlie for help.

*“…I’m not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, Mr. Lutzwater.”* Charlie mumbled, who was also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Who the hell would try to enter the complex through the fucking sewers?*

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on Charlie, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn’t know what he wanted. He was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some a blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state. Only after a short time did Mr. Lutzwater grasp that his request could be seen as outlandish to anyone unaware of what writhed within his apartment complex.

basically im asking is it complicated? i know i have to do a fafsa and get my high school transcripts but ive never done those things. is it difficult? 

i have two jobs and i am worried about doing 2 jobs and school but quitting one of my jobs just isn’t an option. my job that isn’t starbucks is mostly seasonal, where i mainly work it may-september. the rest of the year i work maybe 1 day a week with this job, or 1 day every other week so i have a lot more free time in the fall and winter than i do in spring and summer. 
 
is asu actually self paced? i know we have to pay for books but is that generally a high expense? is the tuition coverage considered taxable income? i have a macbook laptop, will that computer be good enough? i’m most likely gonna do graphic design if i do it if that helps at all.
also someone on another page mentioned CLEP tests. has anyone else done that? 

my passion is art, i’ve thought about opening my own coffee shop in the future, the overall goal would be able to get to a place where i’m making money through commissions or just selling my art. my fear is that without a degree i’ll be stuck in my current city or feel like i can never  leave starbucks which is why i feel like i need to do asu but im worried about burnout.

Hello everyone! 

As the title suggests, I’m looking to buy the Lelit Bianca V3 and I was hoping to get some advice from the community. 

For context, I have just upgraded my grinder from the Breville SGP to the Timemore Scuptor 078s. My current espresso machine is the Breville Bambino Plus. I mostly drink light - medium roast americanos with the occasional oat lattes. 

Here are the questions that I have:
1.  I live in Singapore, and I can get the Bianca for SGD3.5k from an official distributor here. However, I saw that a European distributor can deliver to Singapore at a fee, totalling the its costs to about SGD2.5k. Do you reckon the SGD1.0k is worth saving on? Do I expect the need to activate warranty with the Bianca? (In which case I would need to ship the machine back at my own cost) 

2. Given the profile of coffee I drink, would you reckon the Bianca is a good option? I’ve gone down a rabbit hole on YouTube the last couple of weeks but it really seems like every machine out there has its pros and cons.

1h8iyaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h8iyaz/should_i_try_to_reconnect_with_my_ex/,Should I try to reconnect with my ex,"Hi all,

I know the general consensus on reaching out to an ex is a no, but hear me out. Some background: my ex and I ended kind of messy about a year and a half ago, she reached out drunk to me twice about a year ago and we haven’t really spoken since outside of the occasional story like or birthday text. Anyways, tomorrow is my ex’s birthday and I’m planning to wish her a happy birthday as we usually do.

My question isn’t whether or not I should wish her a happy birthday, I really want to reconnect and try to be friends. I can confidently say that I’m over my ex romantically. I don’t have any sexual interest in her, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t wish I could hang out and get ice cream, go to a concert, or get some dinner like regular friends.

On one hand, it’s been almost 2 years and I feel like we’ve both changed a lot, I definitely have. On the other hand, I don’t want to reach out and look like a fool if she has no interest in talking to me. What do you guys think?

Should I reach out and try to rekindle and meet up for a coffee or should I just wish her happy birthday and leave it at that?

All advice is welcome. Thank you.

**Published:** 20:47 EST, 6 December 2024 | **Updated:** 20:54 EST, 6 December 2024

When six-year-old child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey woke on [Christmas](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/christmas/index.html) Day 1996 she was thrilled to find that Santa Claus had left her a new shiny pink bicycle.

The little girl, holder of pageant titles including Little Miss [Colorado](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/colorado/index.html), tried it out later that day, cheered on by her nine-year-old brother, Burke.

Later, the family went to dinner at the house of some friends. And when JonBenet fell asleep on the way home to their sprawling five-bedroom Tudor-style house in an affluent suburb of Boulder, Colorado, her father John carried her to bed and her mother Patsy tucked her in.

Next day the Ramseys had planned to take a 7am flight, on their private plane, from Colorado to their second home in [Michigan](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/michigan/index.html), to continue Christmas celebrations with John's two older children from his previous marriage.

New year was going to be spent on a Disney cruise. A snapshot of family life living the American Dream, it seemed.

John, a successful businessman, whose computer company had just passed the $1billion revenue mark, had also been named Entrepreneur of the Year by his local chamber of commerce. Patsy, meanwhile, a traditional stay-at-home mum, was relieved to be in remission from stage four ovarian [cancer](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/cancer/index.html).

**What the couple could not have known, however, was that they had just experienced the last truly joyful and carefree moment of their lives.** Instead, they were plunged into a nightmare that continues to blight the family even to this day.

Not only was JonBenet murdered and sexually assaulted – her tiny body left in the basement of the family home and a bizarre ransom note left behind – but the couple, and even their young son Burke, instantly became suspects. In the media frenzy that followed, each was torn apart in the court of public opinion.

Six-year-old child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey was holder of pageant titles including Little Miss Colorado before she was murdered and sexually assaulted 

Nearly three decades on, not only does the murder remain unsolved but the family finds itself dragged before that court once again, with the broadcast of the new Netflix three-part documentary: Cold Case: Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey?

While **the series** is a sober recreation of the tragic events of that day and highlights the ineptitude of the local police force, it **has led to the evidence and reputations of surviving family members being raked over and trashed anew.**

So-called TikTok armchair detectives, who were not even born when JonBenet was killed, have been spouting their theories on social media about who they believe really was responsible for the death of this little girl. Fingers are pointing once again at her immediate family, who for 12 years lived under a cloud of suspicion.

It took until 2008 before the Ramseys were publicly exonerated after new DNA evidence, taken from JonBenet's clothing, identified the involvement of an 'unknown male' in her death.

**You have to admire, therefore, the bravery of John Andrew Ramsey for speaking out now about the case that has haunted his family for 28 years.**

In an exclusive interview with the Mail, the older, half-brother of JonBenet, who was 23 at the time of her murder, described his family's torment and his conviction of their innocence. Speaking from his home in Colorado, he tells me, 'If I'd thought for a minute my father or Patsy or Burke was capable of murder, I'd have flipped on them in a heartbeat.

# 'There's someone out there who knows something that could help catch my sister's killer. The narrative is that this is an unsolved homicide. We want to keep the pressure on law enforcement and encourage anyone who might have information to come forward.'

John Andrew, now a 48-year-old father of two, believes it is crucial that his 80-year-old father finally knows the truth about his daughter's death. Sadly, it's too late for JonBenet's mother. Patsy died of cancer in 2006, at the age of 49, two years before prosecutors publicly cleared her name.

**Understandably keen to protect his own young family, John Andrew is reluctant to reveal details of his life now but tells me he has given up his position in healthcare technology sales to focus on finding the killer, or killers, of his little sister.**

**'As crazy as it sounds, it's a full-time job,' he says. His voice still falters as he relives the events of that dreadful day.** The facts, as told and re-told by the Ramseys, are as follows:

In the early hours of December 26, 1996, Patsy had gone downstairs to make coffee when she found a handwritten three-page note on the stairs. Claiming to be from 'a foreign faction', the author said JonBenet had been kidnapped and demanded the precise sum of $118,000 in $100 and $20 notes for her return.

The author went on to instruct John to withdraw the money from his bank and on returning home to put the money 'in a brown paper bag'. At an arranged drop-off point he would be 'scanned for electronic devices.'

He or she went on to write: 'Any deviation of my instructions will result in the immediate execution of your daughter.'

Patsy screamed, waking John. He checked JonBenet's bed and found it empty. At 5.52am, Patsy dialled 911.

Within minutes, local police arrived and carried out a cursory search of the three-storey house, assuming this was a kidnap and that JonBenet wasn't there.

John Andrew and his sister Melinda were alerted, and made plans to divert to Colorado.

Meanwhile, John and Patsy waited by the phone. The ransom note had told John to wait for a call, but it never came. It was clear from the outset, he says, that the local police were out of their depth. 'This was a small town police department the day after Christmas when the best and brightest were on holiday,' John Andrew says.

Nine hours later, a female police officer suggested another search of the house. 'I think she was trying to keep Dad busy,' says John Andrew. But when his father John, accompanied by a friend, went to the basement, he made a terrible discovery in a disused boiler room.

JonBenet had been laid on the floor and covered in a blanket. She had duct tape over her mouth, her hands had been tied and a garotte – fashioned from cord and a broken paintbrush – tied around her neck.

Had police conducted a proper search, they would have found the body themselves and sealed off the scene, securing vital evidence. As it was, John was the first to find – and handle – his daughter's body. 'He instinctively picked her up,' John Andrew explains. 

The scene of the murder of six-year-old JonBenet in Boulder, Colorado, in 1996

A week before her death, JonBenet was featured in a Boulder Christmas parade - with her name displayed along the side of her float 

'He took the tape off her mouth and tried to untie her hands as he took her upstairs. It was quickly determined that she was dead.' An autopsy later revealed that the child had a fractured skull, had been sexually assaulted, and the cause of death was asphyxiation by strangulation. 

John Andrew and Melinda arrived at the house shortly after her body was found, and the whole family was driven to stay with friends.

The story was soon leading news programmes with videos of JonBenet, taken at beauty pageants she had competed in, winning titles such as Colorado State All Star Kids Cover Girl and National Tiny Miss Beauty.

Sashaying in high heels, her blonde hair backcombed, and her baby doll-like features adorned in heavy make-up, the videos suddenly seemed a little sinister. Many saw them as evidence of a little girl being sexualised.

Before long, media of all levels decamped to the well-to-do suburb in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. John Andrew is still clearly angry that suspicion fell – and continues to fall – on his father and stepmother.

# 'To the people who think Dad and Patsy killed JonBenet in some crazy accident and tried to cover it up... are you telling me that they sat in a room with the police for nine hours and kept up this ruse with their daughter lying dead on the floor below? No way.'

Both his father and Patsy were 'out of their minds' with grief, he says, but police were convinced that Patsy had accidentally killed JonBenet and John had tried to cover it up.

Outside offers of help from the FBI and Denver Police Department were turned down, as local police concentrated their efforts on pinning the crime on Patsy, he says.

**'JonBenet was tortured... anyone who's seen the autopsy photographs and the deep injuries to her neck will tell you she was tortured. The idea that Dad and Patsy would do that is unimaginable. What happened fits the profile of a sadistic paedophile.'**

Criticism was levelled at JonBenet's parents because they refused to be interviewed, but John Andrew says there was a reason for this.

**'When JonBenet's body was found, we were with the police for the next 36 hours. They were in the house, monitoring us. We provided DNA, handwriting samples, provided statements. Melinda, Burke and I were all interviewed.**

**'We gave them every piece of information they wanted. We said 'Whatever you need, we're going to give it to you but we're not going to sit down just to be beat up – that's foolish,'.'**

John Andrew puts forward his theory about what happened.

'I think the killer entered the home when the family was out to dinner and waited – and if you look at the behavioural characteristics of a sadistic paedophile… they stalk their victims,' he suggests. The fact that John's latest bonus had been $118,000 – the exact amount the author of the ransom note had demanded on a notepad that incidentally belonged to Patsy – made the mystery more strange and chilling.

John Andrew says: 'The guy had hours in the home before my Dad and Patsy and the kids got back and the $118,000 would have been on every single one of my Dad's pay stubs in the house.'

The film Ransom starring Mel Gibson as an airline magnate whose son is kidnapped was the number two most popular film in the US at the time, he points out.

'It fuelled the fantasy, no question,' he says.

Another bone of contention were outlandish details aired in the press. 'The headline in one newspaper was 'No Footprints in the Snow' insinuating that it must have been an inside job, but if you look at the crime scene photos you will see that there was no snow around the house. It was a total farce,' says John Andrew.

**A week before her death, JonBenet was featured in a Boulder Christmas parade – with her name displayed along the side of her float.** John Andrew's father was also lauded at the event for his business acumen and John himself believes this may have been a significant event.

**'I don't think the killer actually knew my father, but I think he was jealous of his success and if you couple that with a sexual perversion – the way to hurt my father was through JonBenet,' John Andrew says.**

Over the years, the rumours continued to swirl. In 2016, American TV station CBS suggested in a documentary that JonBenet's brother Burke, who was nine at the time of his sister's murder, had killed his sister and conspired with his parents to cover it up.

He won an out of court settlement and did not participate in the Netflix documentary.

For a long time his parents shielded him. The accusations were so outlandish that they're almost hard to take seriously, but the reality is they were hurtful and damaging, John Andrew says: **'He's now a software engineer, has a good job and a group of friends.'**

**John Andrew sounds emotional again when he speaks about his father, who remarried ten years ago. 'He lost his daughter and he lost his house, his job and his ability to make money. He and Patsy never wanted to go back to the house, so they sold it.'**

With the 28th anniversary of JonBenet's death approaching, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn has released a statement regarding the case.

'The killing of JonBenet was an unspeakable crime and this tragedy has never left our hearts,' Redfearn said. 'We continue to work with DNA experts. This investigation will always be a priority for Boulder Police Department.'

As it will be for John Andrew and his family, who will never give up either. He believes advanced DNA testing could crack the case or someone could finally come forward with vital information.",8,1733539864.0,JonBenet,3,0.79,False

I (21M) am in college now, this is my third year. For context, I did theatre in high school and to be honest it was a pretty bad experience for me looking back (as was high school as a whole), full of hierarchy and a fair amount of bullying as well.

Anyway, I have pretty much stopped talking to anyone I went to high school with. Nothing in specific happened but I just got new friends at college and got closer to them.

So basically my neighbor Anna and her boyfriend Carson did theatre with me in high school for the time we are at school together (they are two years younger than me). Both of them go to my university now—and I’ll still talk to both of them, as I grew up with Anna and Carson is a pretty sweet guy.

Long story short, we met up a few weeks ago for coffee. Carson said he was going back to the high school (our hometown is like an hour ish drive from school) to see the November theatre production. He asked if I was gonna go see it too, and I kinda scoffed and said “Hell no,” and laughing a bit said “I did not peak in high school, I am not going back there”. Carson looked all upset and got quiet for the rest of our time at the coffee shop.

It’s been a few weeks and I’ve seen Anna once or twice but not Carson. I’m debating whether or not I was wrong for what I said, but I do have to say I’m glad I didn’t peak in high school lmao. Still, I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings.

TLDR

Short story is, my partner became addicted to gambling, I found out after she had lost £75k over a couple of years sports betting. Our annual income was about half that, no savings, so this all went on as debt. Loans, credit cards. She looks after our finances, and continued to do so, afterwards. Did it again a few years later, this time with leveraged crypto trading, lost another 75k in under a year. To say this has put a strain on our relationship would be an understatement. We are now all but broken up, still living together, but I was hoping she was going to take steps to solve her issues, and so we could work on ours for the betterment of us and our kids and their future, but instead I have found that she is labelling me as a domestic abuser and getting confirmation left right and center from gambling addiction forums and a counsellor.

I'm shaking writing this, I just can't believe it. I mean I can, but I can't. What can I do?

Long story is, our relationship was always a bit up and down. She seemed to have issues with low self esteem. This is what she described as her problem early on as to why we kept falling out. She'd do things like flirt with other men in front of me to make me jealous because she felt I was losing interest sexually. Her plan was I would fight for her. Instead I was disgusted with her and very upset. At the time I walked away. Then when we were alone I asked what that was about, and she said I had imagined it. She had her arm round the guys waist ffs. Maybe a week later, could be longer as I can't remember how it came back up, maybe it was a week long rocky patch, but she apologised and explained why she did it.

There have been various instances like this, sometimes her apologising soon after, sometimes weeks or even years later after having me believe it was in my head. One particular event that messed me up for a good while was her rape story. One drunken evening she was telling me a story of how she was on a night out with some girl friends and they ended up back at a flat with bunch of guys. One of the girls wanting to get it on with one of the guys and then others pairing off. I asked if she did anything with anyone. She said no. She said one guy was coming on to her, but she just fell asleep on the sofa. She woke up to him walking off pulling off a condom. I was dumbstruck... To me this sounded like rape, possibly even date rape given how suddenly murky she said it all was, and I said so. Not a lot more was said, but after that I really beat myself up thinking that I had just broken it to her that she was raped and she had never put that together herself. She was happily ignorant and then I opened my stupid mouth! She'd just found out that 20 years ago she was raped, and I broke it to her. Horrible. Years later she told me that story again. Except it changed, almost like she had forgotten about the rape angle. I didn't think much of it, I didn't want to, but years later, again it had changed. She's completely forgotten about him walking off removing the condom, she's changed it to we had sex, but I didn't really want to and just wanted it to end. While this is sad and all, I was broken by this. I had silently given myself so much shit for a decade over the idea that I had broken it to her that she was raped. All these years, and she had just let me.

The fact of the matter is, I think the gambling, while an illness, is actually a symptom of something else, something she is not dealing with. She has said low self esteem and I have spent years trying to find ways to help her. She stopped driving, so we bought another car just to be hers. The most expensive car in the household. It sat for about 2 years, but eventually she started driving it. I tried to encourage her to drive, by saying lets go for a short drive but she would always put it off and then started reacting angrily as if I was trying to stress her out by mentioning it. So I stopped mentioning it. We still talked about it now and then when she'd bring up that she needed to get driving, but just left it with her.

We had a son, which took her away from our business which we started together. She felt that the business was my baby, something to be proud of and she had nothing, her words. I was gutted she felt that way as it was always our creation and I told her all the ways it was hers and how it would never have happened without her. She seemed to appreciate this. I also tried to find more ways for her to be involved. She ended up doing all the admin which she wanted so now I was just a workshop monkey. I was drawing up plans to make a child safe office/play area so that we could work together at the workshop again. She never showed any interest so it never happened. We were both pretty depressed about money. Our designs had been copied by a larger competitor, so we always struggled while they made millions. We saw them buy a £900k house, an Aston Martin, a convertible BMW for her, posh holidays. Hard not to feel dead inside, irony aside. I was working my arse off in the workshop, but she complained that we needed more sales, we were not making money. I couldn't understand it, with the amount of work I was doing, it didn't add up. She took my confusion as an attack, same old story. Low self esteem, takes everything as an attack. Sure I was looking to her for answers, she does our books, she does all our finances, I didn't even know my online banking details at the time, she did it all, but I didn't mean it as an attack. This is how it would always go, she'd get defensive and start accusing me of attacking her. As soon as that happens I have to be very careful, it is incredibly frustrating, but if I bite then she wins, I am the angry bad guy. Same again the following year, now I'm really smelling a rat, where the hell is all the money.

We had been through a short phase of gambling together. First just silly bets on Eurovision, then we discovered arbitrage. Quickly learned we couldn't make much from that, and bookies banned us for our strange betting. We didn't bet much, and gave up pretty quick. She had a go with tennis betting, because after being home so much with the tennis in the background, she felt she knew her stuff. We agreed a couple of hundred could be her pot to experiment with, once it's gone it's gone. She told me she was making small gains and felt really confident in her knowledge. At the time I told her she should try trading bitcoin. Secretly this is what I wanted to be doing but never had the disposable income to put some into bitcoin. Instead I had watched it all the way from £10 and did nothing. Definitely could have afforded to lose £20 back then, just about. Wish I had taken the punt. Anyway, a month later I said ""you still got your pot?"" She said not much and that she had given up on it. I agreed this was for the best. Actually relieved.



Fast forward a year, turns out she never stopped, and after 2 years, she was losing £500 a day on average. When I first found out I was in shock. I asked her about it, she tried to deny it, but she had left her laptop open and I could see the daily £500 deposits. She broke down, a horrible deep crying noise. It's horrible to say, but part of me misses that crying sound. It's perhaps the last time I ever thought she was truly sorry. All I could say is ""what have you done?"" with my face in my hands. Eventually I came to my senses enough to ask how much? She told me everything would be fine, she will do what ever it takes to make it right. She will get a job to pay it off, it was just a £10k loan she had through her mum, she had only lost 10, maybe 15k. Then a bit later, maybe £20k, but definitely no more than that. I genuinely think she believed this 'final answer'. At the time, we had a house, 70K down, 200k mortgage, interest only. Renewal coming up in a year. I thought shit we're going to lose the house. Worse than that, I thought we were done, and she was going to take my son, so I was losing him. I decided I needed to see everything, all accounts, gambling, banks, emails, everything. I drove to work to go through it all alone and found that it was £75k over 2 years. Mostly in the 2nd year. Looking at the deposits I got angrier and angrier, then the relentless, hopeless £500 deposits going in bang, again, and again, I could feel her desperation and I felt so sad for her going through all that alone. Very angry for doing this to us, and for making me feel like I wasn't doing enough at work. All the fallouts where I knew something was off, but she would convince me it was in my head or she would just apologise and blame low self esteem or just being low or something. And angry looking at the times involved. She had been gambling while I had my head in her lap of an evening. Gambling all day long when she said she wanted to be at home for our son. I had been suspicious that he seemed desperate for attention when I got home from work, even though he should have had it most of the day. I'm not sure I ever brought this up. No way I could have manoeuvred that minefield, but it all made sense now. Still I was gutted for her at the same time, and this was the emotion that made my mind up, and I decided I would go home and support her. My words were, you have a sickness, but I am an ""in sickness and health kinda guy, we will get through this"".



I came up with a plan which involved refinancing a load of bad debt. I think I got 30 or 40k in loans. Not great interest, but better than the credit cards she had. We would cut back and live cheap, worst case scenario we would lose the house or look into bankruptcy type solutions. Looking back, she should have done that. Probably could have saved the house and avoided dragging me quite so far down with her and potentially condemning our family to poverty for generations.



She struggled with the guilt and the crushingly low self worth, understandably, but I tried to be there for her. I reasoned that it wasn't all her fault. We had started that gambling journey together, and she had continued as a means of escape. I had been escaping too, to work, or phases of time waster games in the evenings and weekends, or even at work. What damage have I done to the business? Perhaps more than her gambling? I thought I could try and share the burden, the responsibility. She said she did the gambling because she wanted to win big and be the great hero, like, ""surprise, look what I did!"" I get it, but oh my god. I tried to be there for her, but we did still fall out. Sometimes I could just get up in the morning and I was in the dog house, which means, her grumpy and giving me silent treatment. When I'd eventually cave and ask what I had done, she'd say I was being off with her, but I literally hadn't seen her that day. Did I say good morning wrong? Was it earlier, did I say good night wrong? I'd ask this sometimes in frustration and she would twist it and say I had been this way for days.

I'm not perfect, I do get low, especially now, but sometimes I'd be tearing my hair out trying to work out what I have done wrong. Why the egg shells? So sometimes I would avoid her, escape into timewaster games, read a book, whatever. I was certainly depressed. I have suffered depression most my life, these days without medication. I don't have any friends or family as I don't keep in touch (I find it stressful) and they give up. With her I learned to let her know if I was low so that she knows me being introvert is not her its me and I'd make extra effort to let her know what I was thinking, but usually it was just a mess of obsessive hopelessness thoughts and memories that seems counter productive to share. When I have shared she is sometimes part of the thoughts, often really, as the obsessive thoughts span decades. A cycle I am constantly working to break. But she would take this as an attack, not necessarily using it against me at the time, but later she would accuse me of silently hating her. This is hurtful in itself as it is using my sharing against me. I was not hating her, I was just processing it all, not just what she has done, but what I have done, or not done, actually mostly how shit I am, what our business competitors have done, how rude our customers are, how the whole world seems to be against us blah blah blah self pity, pull yourself together. Easier said than done.

After strops, she would sometimes apologise days later saying it was pmt, or she was low. But I swear sometimes it was like 2weeks either side of her period I was the enemy. I was brought up never to mention pmt, but she brought it up so I thought, well, maybe that's actually it all these years?? The real problem is, when she gets this way, she is the opposite of low self esteem. Good for her feeling up, but she is so sure of herself, so sure that I am a bastard, she starts throwing all sorts at me from nowhere like I don't appreciate her or what she does around the house or for the kids. When she starts feeling sorry for herself and taking it out on me I get really wound up. I have spent years trying to help her feel better about herself. She does do more internal chores around the house and the kids than me, but not all and certainly not unappreciated. I would make a conscious effort to let it be known how awesome she was, and I can actually be a bit hard on the kids (we have 2 now) as they can sound a bit spoilt at times and take her for granted, so I try to get them to do more and respect how much their mummy does for them, they're only young though so nothing drastic, but it just really infuriates me when she basically throws everything I've done back at me as if it never happened and I am in fact the opposite, or that the things I have done, are in fact abusive.

Then I get resentful. How dare she be this way when I have stood by her, and for us, after what she has put me through and we are still going through. She expects me to forget. How can I forget when we are still 100k in debt!!?? I resent being treated like this, even when I am to blame, like, heaven forbid, I am actually grumpy one morning and fail to hide it well enough. Damn, can't I have some slack. Have I not earned a bit of slack given the country mile of slack and understanding I have given? To explain my anger I explain the source of my resentment, this is where I remind her of all the shit she has put me through and the damage she has done to this family. I believe forgiveness takes time, and although many hurts have been healing, when she suddenly sees herself as all perfect and me the bad guy, I feel like the only way of snapping her out of it is in my incredulity. She says things like, oh will you never get over that. It takes a while to get over a 75k debt... We ended up needing more loans due to the money she had taken out of the business cash flow. Then she does it again, we had already lost our house. I worked myself to the bone to sell it. Her too, it was part of my rescue plan, and we turned our £70k deposit into £200k. We had to move to rented, and move the business. A huge undertaking on top of completely redecorating the house inside and out. But we did it. Lost all our staff, but did it. I wanted to invest a portion in bitcoin now that we finally had some money. We still had a lot of debt, but most of it now on very low interest, lower than inflation so not worth paying off.



We got carried away with bitcoin. Invested 100K, was only supposed to be 20k. The plan was to hold it for 5 years then take profit, but it started exploding immediately which caused us to get carried away buying instead of selling. Stupid, but it didn't change the plan. It just meant we were more leveraged than we wanted to be. We just needed to play it safe, push the business, and we could still afford to lose it all if the worst happened. Just don't do anything stupid. We had a great year in the business. Made 70k, but I saw no money. It's expensive here she tells me. The move was expensive. The move was a hell of a lot of hard work on my part, but not expensive. She's done it again. 75k gone again.



I blame myself to a large extent because I should never have allowed my finances to be so controlled by anyone else. I just saw us as a unit. She is an extension of me, and I her, so why not. When she turns on me, she treats me like I am some sort of monster, and I struggle to find where it comes from. When I push for answers she says it is not like that at all, I am imagining it, she loves me, she says she's just messed up. I said I would take control of finances after the first time, and have access to her emails etc so this could not happen again. She was fine with this, but I wasn't and so buried my head in the sand. I did have access, but she still controlled it all, paying bills home and business, doing accounts. Part of me was afraid to take control because, especially after the second time, I was having a real identity crisis. I still am to be honest. I don't know who I am. I feel like a complete loser and waste of space. On the other hand I feel like I have been awesome, not perfect, I've been angry, even physical once when I physically threw her out the house when I found she had paid for some online gambling game. She had argued that it was a treat for selling something, and I couldn't believe how cavalier she was about it, but she stuck to her guns. Completely unapologetic or aware of the distress this was causing me and would cause me going forward, or the damage it had done to the years she had been gambling free and the trust between us. The trust and wounds were no where near healed but this just tore them right back open and then some. All because of a £15 scratch card type game. That's not what it was but it was something like that I forget. I lost it and said I want you gone. She spat back with venom like I was a monster and swearing at me calling me all sorts. I've never hit a woman, but I have dreamt of beating her to a pulp after the second 75k. I woke up in shock, I had dreamt of doing this to others, but never a woman, and the one you love! I was horrified at what this might mean. I was in a bad place identity wise. Still am. What if I am a monster? I can't control the finances, that would be financial abuse then I definitely would be an abuser on paper. Even though this is common in couples where one is an addict.

I threw her out, not to the ground or anything as violent as that, but it was still physical. I am in conflict with myself. On one hand I am ashamed, I want to always keep my cool and handle things coolly and certainly without violence to a woman. On the other hand, I honestly feel like she is the abuser. If the roles were reversed, me the woman, her the man, I would have been cheering me on if it were a scene in a film. I let her back in about 10mins later though. So not very well thought out, but I remain conflicted as to whether I was on the right track in a way. I do wish she was gone. I wish she was here and happy most of all, but as she is... I can't get my head around it. So hateful.

Her treating me like an abuser whenever she wanted her pound of flesh gave me a complex, made me question, am I abusive? She has thrown everything I have ever done, to make her feel better about herself, back at me as if that was actually me being abusive.

I was very low this year. We have moved again, still renting, still massively in debt, about 100k. But we somehow managed to keep 2 bitcoin. It was 8, but due to the unexpected leverage she caused, we have had to sell at the worst times to make ends meet. On paper we could be debt free now, I think perhaps this is partly why she is behaving the way she is now. She feels completely absolved, but in my head, we could be millionaires if it weren't for the huge burden of the debts she created over the past 7years. We could still have 8 bitcoin. Perhaps even more. But perhaps none at all because without the events that led up to us having to sell the house, we would probably not have bought any.

We moved about a year ago. We hated where we were. Her Mum lived with us all along and died last year. Last year was hellish, on top of everything else, and we were about to go bankrupt. She praised me for my support during her Mum's illness, now she calls me an abuser. A place came up for rent, an amazing place, in Scotland, where we dreamed of one day living. A dream we had buried because her Mum hated the idea of being remote, something we dreamed of (but now she complains about being remote and blames me for it as if I have forced this on her). With her Mum gone, and this opportunity, we grabbed it. A hellish amount of work to achieve but again we did it. We have been burned out this year. Our business turnover has died. I have fallen into a deep low feeling utterly powerless to fix it and feeling a complete waste of space. Falling back on escaping. Drinking in the evenings, gaming in the day. Not always, I would have phases of productivity, but never seeing things through. New products all but complete. I still took the kids walking up mountains and camping and fishing and panning for gold. But the past few months I have been in a very bad way. Complete escape. Products should have been online months ago. Too late in the year now to expect anything. Feeling hopeless because as soon as I put the designs online they will be copied and so we have a very short space of time to make money and I am just so damn tired. I've pulled us out of this hole before only to be thrown back in deeper.

This low was different to big ones of the past. This one I saw, and I spoke about. She was understanding. I was careful how I worded things. Yes I blame her for our situation, but not entirely, and that was not the entirety of my low. It was everything, always is. It was mostly my own lack of self worth. I'm 40years old, degree in engineering, phd drop out, and a fucking idiot with nothing to show for it and nothing left in the tank to do anything about it.

I changed. I decided my brain is chemically imbalanced. I am not getting joy from things that should bring me joy. So I have been trying to remove stimulants from my daily routines. The main ones, no more vaping, no more drinking, no more gaming. I honestly believe the stimulants have damaged me and only hope I will heal. I have since stopped coffee and tea too. The escaping is the hardest to quit. Even this writing is an escape. I'm not there yet.

Initially I was in a bad way. Mainly from the vaping I think. Really spaced out and vacant. I explained what I was doing to her and why I was so vacant. She was being really egg shelly. Typical timing. I've tried to make similar changes in the past, but it never stuck, but I don't know why my trying would piss her off. This was really bad timing because I was at my turning point, I had to make a change. Now she wants egg shells.



I had been tapering off the vaping for a couple of days, and today was my last puff. We got out of bed, she got up first and had a bath, I got out when I heard her get out the bath. I came downstairs said morning, and she answered with a distressed look ""is everything alright??"" I was a bit taken aback, no idea where this was coming from, I said ""yeah, of course why wouldn't it be?"" She said she feels a bit on edge and I said ""but we've just got up?"" and immediately ""everything's fine, sorry, I've just woken up"". I'm terrified, I've been here all too many times before. I hide in the living room, counting down the hours until we have to go to work. She remains short and stompy. At some point I have my last puff of the vape. Crazy the effect it has on my mentality. My heart was very slow, I felt like I needed to hibernate. Then bam, I'm back. So glad I was getting off this crap. By the time we were at work I was very spaced out. Getting stuff done, but standing around a lot looking lost. We took a break together and I was silent. I knew she'd be obsessing over what I was thinking so I broke the silence with ""will be glad when I'm off this"" nodding at her vape. I didn't mean to knock her for still vaping or anything like that. I was just trying to reassure her that this is all I was going through, as I had already explained. I had already told her this is what I was doing and this was how it was affecting me.

She got up and kinda bitchily said, ""right back to work is it."" We had been sat for about 20 seconds. Normally we could drag a break out for 20 minutes! I was like, ""sure"". But then we were working together and she was slamming things about and I just snapped at her, ""look, I'm sorry, but I'm really struggling with this right now and I can't be doing with your shit"". I know it was harsh, but I was struggling to make sense of anything, I could barely deal with my own shit let alone whatever her problem was and I just had to push through this.

She of course continued to have me well and truly in the dog house, now apparently in the right all along, she felt more confident than ever. I just had to ignore it and push through. She eventually let me have it though a couple of days later after much passive aggressiveness. I think it started with her demanding we talk about what happened in the workshop, and I agreed we needed to talk about it as I had told her what I was going through, I couldn't have been more open about it. I was anxious that she was off and worried she she had the wrong idea of what I was thinking. I made it clear multiple times that I was just coming off the vaping and it was messing me up, I'm just a bit spaced and can't think straight. But now I was concerned as to why she has chosen this time in particular to make things difficult.

I was coming out of a very deep low, making massive changes, and she seems to have taken this as an attack. She belittled my changes saying wow you've quit vaping for 2 days and said ""well I have a few things to say about you"" spat with venom. Here it is, I am the monster again. What the hell have I done now. I don't appreciate her. ""I have been a stain on the sofa this year while she has held our family together and the business, and I don't appreciate any of it. She is ashamed of me, she keeps the kids away from me because she is ashamed for them to see me the way I am""

And the cycle repeats. Incredulity and resentment. I have not been completely useless this year. We have both been wrecks due to the burn out which we have both been vocal about, sharing and supporting each other and reassuring each other that we just need the break.  She is just as guilty as me at escaping, and in all the same ways. She does still do more of the housework and kids meals, washing etc. But this is something I am not allowed to do. I try to do things like cook, clean, and want to do the washing, but she gets very defensive about any of it. It's 'her' kitchen. When I do it she takes it as an attack, as if I am criticising her, saying that when she does it, it's not good enough. We home school our children. I was excited to be the maths and science guy, but I am not allowed to participate, I'm treated like I'm interfering or not welcome. The kids had a present from the Grandpa so I suggested we write a thank you letter together, and she took this as an attack that she is not doing enough writing with them. It doesn't matter how much I explain this is not the case or how many times, this is how it is stored in her memory.

I have always been appreciative, but even my trying to help is taken as the opposite of appreciation and an attack. If I do it without asking it is an attack and an infringement on her. If I ask ""can I help?"" The answer is always no. When I bring it up in conversation, she says she prefers it this way as it makes her feel useful and she likes to make us happy. But then when she is not being friendly and saying she is unappreciated, I say these things like I always offer to help, and her response is that I shouldn't offer I should just do it. But that fails as already pointed out, she take it as an attack.

My response to this was that I no longer wanted her to do anything for me. I thought this might help us heal. Not as a long term solution. It back fired pretty quick. My answer to people who feel unappreciated is just stop doing it then. She won't stop, and I was in no position to tell her to do anything, so I did it for her. A couple of days later I asked her where the new box of bin bags were. I suspected they were in one of the cupboards right next to me. She was on the other side of the house. She came all the way over, bent on hands and knees and got the box out of the cupboard right in front of me. I uncomfortably said, you can just tell me which cupboard. I sounded annoyed. I was annoyed. I've always found this habit of hers annoying, but right now I was also annoyed at myself for asking. I asked without thinking, I should have just bloody looked in every cupboard like I normally would to avoid just this. Normally I wouldn't have been actually annoyed though, I would have been more like ""there's no need to come over, just tell me"" ""oh no it's fine"" blah blah blah. This time I was annoyed so felt I should explain myself.

Since falling out with me this time, she had decided to sleep in the spare room. I was very happy with this, because usually she would give me the silent treatment and I would not want to go to bed so would end up sleeping on the sofa or the spare room myself. Feeling very hard done by, not sleeping in your own bed having done nothing apparently.

She had apologised for the way she had behaved on that day in the workshop and afterwards. Not very convincingly, she had said she just thought I was being off, and she over reacted and didn't mean any of it, or not the way it came out. None of which made a lot of sense, but whatever, at least she's talking. Things had seemed to be getting friendlier up until this ridiculous cupboard incident. I went to explain why I reacted the way I did. Quite nervously I fumbled with ""I think this might be a problem"", trying to make light of it, ""I don't want you to do stuff for me, because you don't appreciate me appreciating you, and now this you aren't getting appreciated at all..."" She just cut me off with ""yeah yeah yeah I get it."", I walked off but I didn't feel she got it, I was trying to turn it friendly but she was very stressed. I went back to try and explain, and this time she said ""yeah ok stop rubbing it in"". Well this triggered my anger. I was not trying to rub anything in I was trying to do the opposite and yet here we are again with my trying to sooth a situation being yet another attack. This then escalated in to her repeating everything she had said before, so definitely was a ""sorry not sorry"". I'm left with thinking she hates me, really dislikes me, to which she still says nonsense.

A week or two later she has flipped back and forth between giving me the cold shoulder and being friendly. She has accused me of completely shutting her out in an abusive way. Me not wanting her to cook for me is abusive. Me doing my own washing is abusive. She now has her own living room, but me hoovering ours is abusive.

She gets the kids to come and get in bed with her in the mornings, and play on their computers in her sitting room. She still feeds them more than me but I manage to get a few meals in here and there. She has monopolised the kids, which I see as not just abusive to me, but them. She is making me out to be a monster, and what will they think in years to come. She is lovely mummy. I am grumpy daddy. We do have a lot of fun me and the kids, but very sporadic. Better lately now that I am no longer hiding.

She flips to sobbing and wanting to know what do do. I have told her that I am worn out by it all. We have been here so many times and I think that she needs to figure out what the problem is, because I am over it. I flip between seeing hope, and seeing none for us. I want to take the kids away and live happily ever after. I want us all to be there, but I am now almost certain there can be no we, with me and her. If there can be, then she needs to prove it. This continues for weeks, eventually I suggest she speak to a counselor or something. This is where it gets really maddening.



She goes on gamcare, chats with a councillor. They tell her she is being abused and that I sound like a bully. She throws this at me as an attack and says yes I am a bully, and always have been. ""always"". The cycle repeats. I'm shocked. I've seen a couple of counsellors in my time and none have immediately pressed the red button on your relationship with your family. Actually the opposite. I told her this saying I find it highly suspect. She says that's me ""gaslighting"".

This hostility continued, and then she was sobbing again about a week later, saying it wasn't a councillor it was just a chat room, and actually they are all a bit self congratulating in there. I suggested she speak to an actual councillor. I meant NHS, but she went and found one online. I was a bit suspect but she said they have qualifications and have to be registered etc, so ok, I felt hopeful. She is taking steps, we both seemed more positive. She has a 45min call with the counsellor, we cuddle before her call, I just tell her to just talk, just let it out. I take the kids out for a couple of hours. When I get back I ask if she wants to talk about it. She is cold and says confidently, mmm, no, not yet. And that's the end of that. Whatever bridge we were building now seems like it may have been a figment of my imagination.

I ask a bit later, did she give you any advice or anything, she tells me she has another call booked and has some exercise sheets to go through. She says it will help gather her thoughts.

Today she randomly said she was going out for some air. This is very strange, not something she has ever done. But whatever. After an hour it was getting dark and sleeting, wind picking up and forecast 90miles an hour. The kids are worried, where is mummy. The lad goes out looking for her in the garden. I get worried thinking she might have topped herself so I start looking. We have a lot of outbuildings we work from so I went round them all. The lad comes along just as I am finishing, I don't know what to tell him. I go and look at her computer to see if there is any kind of clue and there it is.

The counsellor has told her she sounds like shes in a seriously abusive relationship. My partner is now looking at traintickets 600miles south to her aunt. I'm now thinking has she run off? I look at her history and I see she has spoken to her aunt, I pull it up, it's email, I feel uncomfortable but here I am. Just skimmed it but looks like her aunty is sold, telling her to call, and can do secret message to get her to call or something as if I stop her from making calls?? I don't even have a mobile phone, she has 2 of them!!

So she had gone out to make a call. I tried to call her on the other mobile, engaged. Text her to say we were worried. Had a look at the message thread with this counsellor and it's just unbelievable. She has lost contact with her cousins and blames me for it. She says it's because I used to get drunk and loud when they came over. We all did! it was a new years piss up!! One year I bought her a karoke set for xmas. We were all loud. They just stopped coming. Personally I thought it was because of the mum living with us. She was very rude to them. But I was always telling her to call them or write to them, she just said no, if that's the way they want it, so be it. But now that's all me?? I have no friends or family either, do I blame her?? Maybe I should. She at least still has her dad.

When we met, we were singing along to something and I joked that she was using too much vibrato. The joke was, I sounded like a smart ass prick. She didn't find it funny, and it has come up years later and I have had to explain myself that I was just messing about. But now, she has told the counsellor that she used to do a lot of singing and now doesn't sing anymore because I have belittled her. It was a stupid joke 20 years ago!!! She makes it sound like I have ruined her singing career?? She sings to our daughter every other night!? (We take it in turns taking them to bed)

We were panning in a stream a few months back. She fell over. Actually what happened was, I thought she was falling so sort of moved to grab her, but then stopped because she just sat on the bank so I thought oh, she was just sitting down. So I looked away as if nothing had happened. Then she said, well aren't you going to help me? I was like what, and then it dawned on me, oh, she had fallen and was now sitting not so comfortably so I immediately helped her up and laughed apologetically saying sorry I thought your were just sitting down. She has told the counsellor that I watched her fall over in a river and then looked at her in disgust and then looked around in case anyone saw!

Stories like this go on, how I am ashamed to be seen out with her. We go out together all the time. We go everywhere together! I took her out for a meal on her birthday, and another time recently just for the hell of it. Not as often as I'd like but we are almost bankrupt ffs!!! Apparently I hate it when she cries in public because I worry what people will think of me. Well yeah, that's true. I'm not sure it has ever happened, but yeah, if she were randomly to start crying in public, I would feel uncomfortable. Does that make me a monster? I would want to comfort her, and yeah would probably feel a bit self conscious.

These are the things she has said to the counsellor. In 45 minutes she has come back a serious abuse victim. What does this mean???? Am I going to lose my kids? Am I going to be labelled a domestic abuser!!? What can I do. Everything I have done is being twisted against as me being abusive. Seriously head fucked now.

I assumed she would take the kids, I don't think she would leave any other way and I have sort of come to terms with that. I would have them in a heart beat. I think if I tried to keep custody she might kill herself, while if she took them I will have more time to earn money to support them and still be there for them, and they will still have a loving mother. But now she is making me out to be a monster. Is it true?? Am I this bully?? The past few years, the more she played victim, the more I have started to wonder if I am actually a victim. I have felt like a victim, but shrugged it off as self pity. I have felt like I was just staying for the kids, fake it to make it. Actually I have been flogging a dead horse trying to keep this relationship alive. I have fallen many times in the process. I'm spent, and I've decided the kids would be better off growing up not experiencing our loveless relationship and me in this emotionally numb and spent state. If we have to go our separate ways, so be it. But why like this? I've asked her why is she doing this? Her answer is, you wanted me to go to a counsellor, now that's not good enough, I'm just doing this for me, almost smarmily, while I am in bits asking her why. Why is this happening. I'm not a big crier, I'm a fairly big guy, and macho enough to feel completely pathetic now.

[Neatly Used Coffee Espresso Machine | Groups | Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/540012408310498) [https://www.facebook.com/groups/540012408310498](https://www.facebook.com/groups/540012408310498)

It is a public group with 1.8k members claiming to sell mostly used La Marzocco espresso machines and Niche Zero grinders. 99% of the time the admin is the seller. Most of her posts start off like this: ""Available! Available! Available!@ affordable price. Comes with complete accessories.!"" There are a couple of genuine-LOOKING posts about machines bought off this site so I paid for a used NZ grinder on Nov 24 (Sunday) based on firm assurance from admin/seller that it would be shipped the following Tuesday, Nov 26. I paid $330 + half of the shipping cost, being $45 = $375 in total.

It is now Dec 6 (Friday) and after two full working weeks, the grinder has NOT EVEN BEEN SHIPPED. NO EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER has been given to me about this failure despite MULTIPLE ENQUIRIES on my part.

After MANY attempts at trying to get an update about what is going on, it turns out the admin is NOT even the seller. She is just a middle party with NO CONTROL over the actual shipping of the product I have paid for. This was not indicated in any way in any of her posts.

The admin also assured me on multiple occasions that I will receive a refund if nothing ever gets sent out. She has FAILED to provide a refund and is now UNRESPONSIVE. I am now out of pocket by $375 and no grinder in sight.

I have reported this group and the admin to Facebook and to the Internet Crime Complaint Center. The admin has also very conveniently blocked me from this group - in fact, she did this very early on, when the grinder didn't get shipped on Nov 26. No doubt she knew from the beginning that I would receive nothing for my money.

I would warn anyone not to be as stupid as I have been in buying something they haven't seen from Facebook. I am so upset since NZ is expensive and I just wanted to get a reasonably priced used product. I ended up wasting money and will not be able to get a new grinder for a very long time now.

I am in the US. Only machine I’ve owned in the past is a Keurig k-pod system several years ago. It somehow got infested with ants and I’ve been traumatized of machines ever since, but I don’t think that will be a problem with these machines (or at least I hope!!)

Some requirements: 

•Fully automatic with milk frother 

•$750 MAX - ideally in the $400-700 range!

•Compact size due to limited kitchen space 

•Easy to use for a newbie like me

•Some kind of setting for cold/iced coffee would be ideal, but not necessary 

•Brand with good warranty and customer service so I’m not screwed over if it breaks quickly 

I’m probably the only person in my household who will use it, so I’m looking for one that can just get my daily cup with no hassle or heavy maintenance. Any recommendations or advice for purchasing would be super helpful :) Thanks! ",2,1733539425.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

I was astounded because it came out of NOWHERE. I had asked her previously if she wanted to see Wicked with me, but she said no and I just went with someone else.

I (23 F) have been dating my partner (21) for about year or so and our relationship has been going pretty well so far with just a few bumps along the way. They're a great partner, very caring, giving, attentive, and overall loving person. My only issue is that im having a hard time comforting them in a positive and honest way and giving constructive advice without coming across as a total bitch to them. The main issue is as of the last 3-4 months my partner has been going through some emotional difficulties with their job and has been venting to me about it a lot, especially as of late. to give some background, I understand that working full time can be difficult and draining and they're on their feet all day and get very tired, however, it gets to a point where its no longer venting struggles but constantly whining about every aspect of this job. They work in fast food and on a daily basis when we speak its complaining about how their co worker is always talking, and how the co worker is weird, and how their schedule is getting switched around, and how the dishes from the previous shift never get done, and how they're the only one carrying their weight around there, and that they don't get paid enough for what they do and its these same things day in and day out without a miss. And this is a job they've quit twice and went back to for no reason aside from not liking the other jobs that they got (which had better pay) before going back because they knew the company would take them back. this particular instance, my partner was being very short and clipped and not engaging in conversation and I had asked them what was wrong. They started spiraling and said that they're at a dead end job and have been searching for a new one for weeks and that they're lonely and sad and hate their life and hate being bossed around and tired of other not doing what their asked, and no one cares about them, that they're broke and stressed about money, and no one will help them and that they have to fix everything themselves and just a bunch of other things. I told them that I understand they're upset and and are trying to find a way out of it and try to be comforting and give words of encouragement like they will find something and things are going to be ok and validate their emotions, but what I truly wanted to say was 

\-you are not legally required to slave away there. You can get up and leave and they’d hire someone else. It is not that serious. Youre a grown adult. A privileged grown adult. And you’ve refused help at every chance you’ve received so what is the problem. Truly? like honestly get a fucking grip. Youre not gonna go starving or homeless if you left today. Youre not going to go into mountains of debt. Youre not going to loose all of your belonging. So really tell me what is the problem. Because it all just sound like youre whining about having to wash dishes with an annoying old guy you don’t like and that is gonna be the end of the world for you? i love you  but you need to wake up and smell the fucking coffee because what is so hard about your life with a roof over your head and a bed to sleep in that is making you feel like the entire world and then some is against you.- 

granted I only typed that out out of a just being fed up, **I did not say this to them** and im really trying to find a different way to constructively give them advice and be supportive but they don't pay any bills aside from their car payment and that's literally it. they have no financial obligation, they're not in school, they have a social life, and a partner, and still live with their parents who pay for everything aside from the car payment and their parents are extremely well off and I honestly have little sympathy for them in this situation and this is like the third time they've spiraled out and im unsure of how to handle this again. I don't want to feel resentment for them or invalidate their mental struggles with this but like what do I do. So please let me know if im just an awful partner for thinking this way and if there are things I can do to mediate this feeling. I just feel like a bad partner for not being able to help them feel batter but also I don't want to be dishonest about things like this. sorry this was so long but thank you for reading and any advice is welcome.",1,1733538642.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

Anyway, I have a general question about my grinder I purchased - the Normcore v2 38mm ran me just shy of $100CAD on the Black Friday sales. Seems high quality and fairly consistent, but as someone who has never really played with coarser grind settings, and my espresso grinder really being dialled in for my espressos, I have nothing to compare it to.

People seem to like it, with not much negative points, other than consistency suffers a slight bit in the extremely coarse settings.

I have some nice coffee that I think would go well with pourover (El Paraiso Lychee Castillo), but am wondering if the grinder would be an issue.

I like a sweeter cup, and the grinder would only be used for v60. I have different filter papers, a Hario switch, and plenty of toys to experiment with, but unfortunately my counter space would not support another bigger grinder, as such I’m stuck with a handheld grinder.

So basically - would stepping up to a higher end grinder (I’d say my budget would be around the $250 mark CAD tops) yield significant and noticeable improvements, or is it significantly diminished returns for me?

### Background
Hello again, Runnit.

When last I left you, I had just set a five-minute PR in the [2022 Seattle Half Marathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/z5mu1v/seattle_half_marathon_race_report/). I was riding high, thinking I'd had a massive breakthrough, and daydreaming of maybe, with a couple of years of hard work, BQing in 2025ish.

Let's just say I was, in hindsight, pretty ambitious.

Things got off to a good start in 2023, with a PR in the Cherry Blossom Half that March. It was only six seconds, but on a much tougher course. With that in the bank, I set my next goal: Redeeming myself for the hobbly finish to the 2021 Seattle Marathon. I knew that, if my knees just held together, I could sub-4:00 it for sure.

Nervous about my knees, I spent summer 2023 doing a practice training block for the marathon, and everything went well. I picked up speed on my shorter runs, held together on my long runs (peaking at 22 miles), and my VO2 max topped 53. When September rolled around and it was time to start the real training block, I was as confident as ever.

Did Icarus say the same thing?

The real training block is where things fell apart, with my left IT band developing issues around peak mileage. I tried a compression sleeve and KT tape, but by race day, I knew I was cooked. I showed up for the race anyway, and gave myself permission to quit whenever the pain got too bad. It was a tale of four quarters: The first quarter of the race, I felt okay. The second, I started feeling it. The third, I noticeably slowed. And the fourth, well, never happened. I walked off the course at mile 20.6, when I couldn't keep up with the 4:10 pacers and thought to myself, ""I know what hobbling to the finish of a race feels like, and don't need to do it again.""

The fun thing was, I quit on the inner loop of Green Lake, meaning I had to walk across the outer loop to call an Uber. Let me tell you: If you've never walked through a pack of runners five miles behind you to DNF a race, it's an experience. Still, I considered getting over my stubbornness a moment of personal growth. When I got home, I took off my race bib, stuck it to my fridge—as opposed to the closet shoebox where all my other bibs and medals live—and vowed vengeance in 2024.

### Training
My first run back after last year's DNF was a coffee run at Fleet Feet in Ballard two weeks after the race, and I was reminded how much fun it could be to run with friends instead of being on my own little island. So I started to re-engage with the local community after a couple of years away, and got sucked into things. I ran the St. Patricks Day Dash 5k, PRing by 90 seconds in the process, and then the Cherry Blossom Half (1:37:29, missed my PR by 11 seconds) and celebrated the return of the Top Pot Doughnut Dash 5k (which was the first 5k I ever ran, back in 2011). Then, it was time to get to work.

This summer was all about bulk. I started showing up for more group runs than ever, including quite a few no-drop WWTBC runs that made me slow way down from my usual pace. Some friends and I even got in the habit of running to those runs—there's nothing like running five miles each way to an easy three-mile run to develop a reputation. In mid-July, I even set a weekly mileage PR, at 51.42, though Strava said my Relative Effort was only 60% of when I'd done 50.9 in a week a year earlier.

And yet, my knee. Those two weeks off post-DNF had gotten it back to 95%, but by the summer, it still wasn't any better, and I was once again worried about whether it would hold up. So I took the last week of August off from running, a little reset before Fleet Feet training started. The rest didn't help, which made me wonder if part of the problem was how I sit at my desk, so I made a doctor's appointment and kept moving forward.

Fleet Feet training started August 31st, my first time in the program since early 2022, and I resolved to stick with the plan. That lasted only a few days, before I wound up with a scheduling conflict for half the Wednesday workouts, and I quickly moved back to half-improvising. Meanwhile, my doctor gave me a referral to PT, which started in mid-September.

But first, the Orca Half! A race days before my birthday, where I can see my apartment from the finish line. I roped a group of friends into running it as well—I called us 🐳 Team Six—and as race day approached, I had no real game plan. Push for a PR on a fairly generous course? Take it easy and not aggravate my knee? I still hadn't decided when I arrived at the start line on race day, so I figured I'd run the first chunk of the race (including the one hill) by feel, decide around mile four instead. When decision time came, I was at 7:37/mile, and while I thought I might be able to push and get to a PR, I felt it wasn't worth it. In the end, I finished at 1:39:05—almost two minutes shy of a PR, but good enough for third in my age group, my first ever award.

From then, it was time to lock in. Do my PT three times a week, make as many workouts as possible, hit the hard runs hard and take the easy runs easy, at least by my standards. ""Race pace"" workouts created cognitive dissonance in my brain, the gap between my half-marathon pace (7:30ish/mile) and my marathon goal (9:00/mile) confusing me. Every time, I erred on the hard side.

Still, I had a lot of worries. The longest run of the training program was only 18 miles, and given both of my previous marathons were sunk past that point, doubts reigned. I felt under-trained relative to past races, but considering the overtraining injuries both times, maybe that was a good thing? Or was it? My left knee felt better from all the PT, but my hip and hamstring were barking now, too.

The two weeks before the race, my friends all kept assuring me I had it in the bag, but the more they said that, the less confident I felt. My girlfriend and I had a long conversation one night about all of my doubts, and I told her that I was worried I'd seriously injure myself on this one. She reminded me that I didn't have to run this race, but I felt like after over a year focused on this, I was pot-committed. Either I'd take this race down, or it would take me down.

### Pre-Race
It's a mile walk from my apartment to the start line, so I woke up at 5am, downed a protein bar and a glass of water, and put on all the gear I'd laid out the night before. As I was getting ready to leave the apartment at 6am, I felt zipper on my shorts' cell phone pocket start to break, so I quickly changed into a fresh pair. Was this the one thing that would go wrong today, or an omen?

At Seattle Center, I met up with my girlfriend and our friends from the training program, where I once again assert that this is a horrible idea on my part and I'm probably doomed. I hand my girlfriend a bottle of Gatorlyte and a protein bar for post-race, then dashed to the bathroom while our friends went on a warmup jog. On the walk back, I downed half a 5-Hour Energy and a GU Stroopwafel, and the girlfriend walked with me to near the finish line as I shook with anxiety. I passed her my jacket, kissed her goodbye, queued up [my race playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/seattle-marathon-2024/pl.u-JP6KJIKGmeP), and got in the corral.

Just not far enough in.

### Race
***Miles 1-4***

When the race begins, I'm stuck way back in the corral, somewhere between the 5:30 and 6:00 pacers, well behind the 3:50 crew I planned on running with. Part of me wants to take my time catching up with them, but I know I won't feel settled until I find them, so I decide to push it.

As I cross the start line, I tap my right headphone, and The Killers' ""[Somebody Told Me](https://youtu.be/Y5fBdpreJiU?si=_RRaaRZ-KUAcDIdN)"" kicks in. This playlist is a work of goddamn art, a conceptual piece that struck me like lightning when I was working on my Orca Half playlist months ago. You see, half marathons are easy for me at this point, but marathons feel impossible. So, I decided to not make a marathon playlist, but rather, two half-marathon playlists: Scrapping my rule of ""no repeating artists within a list"", I made sure every artist repeated, in sequence, with no two tracks from the same album. Side A, Side B.

It sounds easy, but I quickly realized that every time I moved one song, I'd have to move its mirror as well. Things quickly got so complicated that I made a [spreadsheet](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/70cc1qsyqh0aejsl7eeh5/Race-Playlist-Spreadsheet.png?rlkey=430v4xpigfm4zvgvk1utcoje5&st=74pzdt0p&dl=0).

So, anyway, Brandon Flowers requests that I ""pace yourself for me"" as I blow up my race strategy right from the start, and weave my way through slower runners and monorail pylons on 5th Ave, trying to find the pacers I'm counting on. I spot them about a mile in, but I don't catch up until we're about to turn into the I-5 Express Lanes, roughly 1.5 miles (or three tracks) in. As Frightened Rabbit's Scott Hutchinson begins speculating about what happens when our ""[Heads Roll Off](https://youtu.be/nBcbDS5AGnk?si=aFVssRcgi7OyXgvk)"", I shift gears and coast into the dark.

A mile or so later, we re-emerge from the tunnel into the early moments of daylight. Just ahead of me, the 3:50 pacers. Just behind, the 3:55 ones? I briefly wonder whether my guys were slow or those guys are fast, but conclude it's out of my control. Besides, I have at least a minute banked from booking it to catch up with my pacers, so I'm really running at more like a 3:49. I'm where I need to be, no longer ""[Burning Down the House](https://youtu.be/_3eC35LoF4U?si=8u03ZXjipstFgDz7)"". Like the song currently resonating in my earholes, this is all a ""[Jigsaw Falling Into Place](https://youtu.be/GoLJJRIWCLU?si=no34D_uVgsxK9F8U)""

I hit the second aid station around the 3.5-mile mark, and down my first GU (Roctane Sea Salt Chocolate) a minute or two later. My plan for the race is to hit alternating aid stations, for water or Nuun, with GUs at miles 4, 8, 15, 18, and 22, with a Maurten 100 at mile 12, and a mini Japanese KitKat at the spot where I DNFed last year, as a treat.

This will not last.

***Miles 4-8***

Coming off the Express Lanes a little after mile five, I get a little ahead of my pacers, then spot my first friendly face of the course: My girlfriend's ex-husband, who's working the third aid station. (It's fine, we're cool, stop worrying, I said he's a friendly face.) I skip the station, and he's too busy grabbing cups to see me zoom by. A few minutes later, I see another pack of friendly faces: Some of the gals from the Fleet Feet program, who are, by sheer coincidence, cheering for folks across the street from my freshman year dorm at UW. I wave as I go by, and notice my mouth feels dry. I begin to reassess my hydration strategy in real time.

The course winds through the UW, up and around Drumheller Fountain, as we come down Rainier Vista, I grab both a Nuun and a water from the fourth aid station. I down them both, followed by another GU, and as we go up and over the bridge to the Husky Stadium light rail station, I self-assess.

This was the spot where I felt the first signs of my knee getting worse last year, as though it was nudging me towards the train: ""Hey, body, we could be home in like ten minutes. You know, if you want to.""

Last year, the pain jumped to a 4/10 around here, and only got worse. In this moment, my knee, hip, and hamstring are all feeling like 2s. I question whether they can hold on. The Beths remind me that ""[Future Me Hates Me](https://youtu.be/8ogCRFOUoZM?si=9EJ6Oe8Ivp2SRA-b),"" but maybe, just maybe, my leg can [Three Stooges Syndrome](https://youtu.be/gmBj8r1-fDo?si=uTuqt2eCZRoDvdyj) this race.

***Miles 8-14***

The course continues, across the cut, through the Arboretum, and up into Interlaken. This is where the 3:40 pacers dropped me last year, and this is where the 3:50 pacers get back ahead of me, after I'd (barely) led them the last few miles. As I try not to worry about it, I spot a convenient distraction: A new nemesis.

Just steps of me, I spot a man wearing white arm sleeves and an off-white tank top reading ""Optimistic Runners"" on the back. I am renowned for running in all black, especially so on race day (the only time I run in all-black Goodrs), and my pessimism is legendary.

I do not know this man. I do not wish him ill. But now, only moments after I've become aware of his existence, I do wish to destroy him.

This man does not know I exist, and his ""[Sweetness](https://youtu.be/ROatPGGMvXg?si=O6pmkv0c19VaoJjM)"" will not be concerned with me.

Onward, we all continue. I find a trash can, and empty my trash pocket, realizing a moment too late that I've thrown out the wrapper for the piece of gum I'm still chewing. I spent a good half a mile debating what to do about it, but as LCD Soundsystem's ""[All My Friends](https://youtu.be/aygY5OqMuKE?si=bRyjSjHE7tGHPwo5)"" kicks in—the first track of the usual ""epic midsection"" of races, which bumped slightly ahead in the mix to accommodate this playlist's concept—I realize I need to decide so I can take my Maurten. I throw the gum I'm chewing in a planter as I run past, and hope the cops blocking cross streets won't take this as a provocation.

The University Bridge. The Burke-Gilman. Gasworks. Back onto the Burke. I've gone from planning on hitting alternating aid stations to getting two cups at every single one and still feeling thirsty. My leg keeps getting grumpier, but at an acceptable rate. Then, the playlist flips.

***Miles 14-18***

When I said goodbye to my girlfriend pre-race, she said she'd be waiting for me right outside her office, at mile 14. ""Side B,"" she said, having heard me ramble about the playlist more than anyone else.

""Maybe the tail end of Side A, if all goes right?"" I replied. ""I gave the playlist some slack.""

It was true—the playlist was timed for a sub-3:57:41 finish, and I planned on running with the 3:50 crowd. But I'm not as far ahead as I thought I might be when I spot her through my sweat-smudged Goodrs and give her a wave. I'm seconds into Side B, somehow both ahead and behind.

Karen O insists I'm a ""[Zero](https://youtu.be/pmGNo8RL5kM?si=HV1U9TnmXgsKLBNV)"" as I keep moving, and as the course takes a steep uphill towards and onto Aurora, Shirley Manson encourages me to ""[Push It](https://youtu.be/Pmd3UiNfNkA?si=boogCl3_1xEvyOq8)"".

As we approach 39th and Aurora, I keep an eye out for my friend Gus, who's supposed to be a course marshal at that intersection. A mutual friend has been joking for two weeks now that Gus will tase me when I pass, but I plan on waving to him anyway. Shockingly, when I spot him, I see a man-shaped crumple at his feet, and Gus is on the phone. I wave at Gus, and he yells words of encouragement despite the phone call.

(The next day, at a post-race party, Gus will tell all of us that said crumple was a 23-year-old man running the half marathon who'd had a cardiac arrest. Gus called for help, medics got there quickly, and the man is expected to be fine. Gus is the real hero of this race report.)

At mile 16, as we reach Green Lake, I pocket my gloves. I'm still with the pacers. The Joy Formidable is singing ""[Cradle](https://youtu.be/W66yhfMb4d0?si=4ev6Kaf1gwRd3Fme)"" to me, and ten miles from freedom, all I want to see is the end of this.

***Miles 18-22***

As I mentioned earlier, this playlist was a real struggle to curate, but one thing that helped it come into focus was the realization that a song by my friends' band, the Smokey Brights, ""[Sad Boy Song #39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c51Z8tLpGB0)"", was begging for that numbered slot in the ultimately 58-track playlist. (Not counting the bonus, filler songs that were there to keep me going if I missed my goal.)

On the walk to the race this morning, I realized that, if all went well, this song would be hitting right around a) the moment when I'll have run farther than I did this whole training block, which also happens to be b) the point where I've historically fallen apart. I made a mental note to check in with myself when it came on, and here it is. I'm doing okay, I think?

I'm still double-fisting at each aid station. The pacers pull ahead of me at each one, about ten seconds in front, but then I close the gap, and then rinse and repeat. If I were an optimist, I'd say I can see the ""[Other Side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3PbFlfurME)"", but, well, we already discussed that like ten miles ago. That guy's still here.

Around mile twenty, one of the four(!) pacers—the two from the first half just kept on going with us, even as their supposed replacements kept over—strikes up a conversation with another runner out of nowhere. I want to scream at them—SOME OF US ARE IN ZONE 4 HERE!—but keep it together. As I pass last years DNF spot, I gulp down the mini KitKat (a suggestion from a friend who said he always likes to have a treat during the home stretch of a race), and get an encouraging text from my girlfriend that I swipe away on my watch. She's trying to be supportive, making sure I know where I'm at. I'm already keenly aware.

And so, we finish the second loop of Green Lake, and swing back onto Aurora. On the uphill, the pacers start to get ahead of me, and I lose sight of my nemesis, too, and I wonder if this hill will be ""[The Only Heartbreaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmXFF_whkVk)"".

***Miles 22-26.2***

I'm definitely losing steam. My left leg issues are starting to ratchet up, my right knee is feeling funky, my biceps—where my long-sleeved shirt is bunching since I pulled it above my elbows forever ago—are going numb, and my mouth definitely doesn't taste like it's supposed to. But I'm still moving. Less fast than before, but still reasonably fast. And there's time on the clock.

I take my last GU (not counting the spare) just after mile 22, and power forward as best I can. At the Aurora Bridge, I finally give in, and walk for a bit, keeping an eye on my watch and swearing I'll get back into a run once my heart rate drops below 140. It gets there, and then when I reach the next street light—no, the next one; okay, the one after that—I return to a run. When the last aid station comes into view, I slow to a walk again, down two Nuuns and a water, and check my watch. I have half an hour to go two miles. I'm feeling sick, but not *that* sick.

I've got this! *I've got this?!*

""[I Know the End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ9-xN6dCW4)"", but I'm ""[Losing My Edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjDMdSwefk)"", and the kids are coming up from behind. One more brief walk, just for a few seconds, and then back into gear.

Down Aurora. Hang a right. Another, and there's the 26 marker, and ""This is nothing like it was in my room, in my best clothes...""

I start feeling so overwhelmed I worry I'm not going to make it the last 0.2. I remember my mentor the first time I did the Fleet Feet program, who puked twice between mile 13 and the finish line of a half, and missed her goal time by something like five seconds, and wonder what fate awaits me at this last left turn and ""I'm the new blue blood, I'm the great white hope..."" and a gentle curve and a turf field and the announcer saying my name and those clocks say 3:52:XX and ""I won't fuck us over, I'm [Mr. November](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxWQMyoYJBU)"" and I'm across the line, still breathing, still upright.

### Post-race
I tap both earbuds, stopping mid-song and deeply mid-daze. A race medal finds its way in my hands and around my neck, and I stumble through the finisher area—thoroughly inundated with non-participants—in search of a space blanket, two bottles of water, and some snacks. I find the first two, at least. And then, the portapotties. At the start of the race, I was sure I'd have to pee at some point, but once the race began, I felt like any pit stop might make everything lock up, like it did three years ago. I wasn't going to risk it.

When I emerge from the portapotty, I'm swarmed by eight or so friends, all seeking fist-bumps and offering congratulations, and one of whom accuses me of sandbagging expectations the last few weeks. But by the time the bumps are all exchanged, they can tell I'm not right, and ask what I need. I say my girlfriend has my Gatorlyte—except I use her name—and she appears seconds later, and we walk off together to find somewhere I can sit or lie down or whatever. I'm pretty sure this is how about half of those folks learned we're dating.

We find a spot in the first row of Memorial Stadium's bleachers, sit down, and I manage a few sips of Gatorlyte before I bend over and start to break down from some combination of pain and emotion and relief for somewhere between five minutes and the five years that it feels like this race took off my life. Once I've returned to being mildly functional, she tells me I came in at 3:51:07, and we walk—well, she walks and I hobble—off towards the monorail that'll get me within crawling distance of home.

Once I'm back in my apartment, I rip last year's race bib off the fridge in a moment of celebration, and soon after, life slowly returns to my body. The girlfriend makes me cinnamon rolls from scratch, and I thank her profusely for everything, especially the shoes from the future that I ran the race in, which she snagged for me. When I mention I finished the race to the tune of ""Mr. November"", she asks me to play it, since she loves that song, and then I play her the playlist's next and final track: Los Campesinos' ""[Avocado, Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-M_m1I1uKU)"", the cacophonous banger I always put at the end of my race playlists, the song that marks my goal time, the song I didn't even make it to today.

The next night, we go to happy hour, then we walk—well, she walks, and I limp—three blocks to the Medal Monday celebration our training group put on. She's wearing her Chicago medal, and I'm wearing my Orca Half and Seattle Marathon ones, and a few more people pick up on the fact that there's something going on here.

At some point in the night, I suggest we make a sacred pledge between us: No marathons in 2025. (In this moment, I forget I've already entered the Chicago lottery.) She's already made such a vow with a close friend, but allows me to join the pact.

I've got a few races on the calendar for next year, but for the first time in five years, I have no real running goals. It's time to have some fun with this whole thing again.

Oh, and get that tattoo I just earned. But that might be a different post, another time.

The last two weeks is when my symptoms started. It started with chronic congestion/headaches and feeling extremely tired all of a sudden. I chalked it up to the season changing because I didn't really feel ""sick"" like I had the cold or flu. I just felt ""off"". Well this continued on and every day I've become more and more tired to the point where I sometimes can't even do anything because I feel so weak and dizzy. This is very unusual for me because I'm usually a very energetic person who's always doing something and I hate feeling tired and I HATE taking naps. 

Well anyways as the days go on I started feeling nauseous out of nowhere and that feeling has not left my body at all. I threw up 3 times the other day after drinking coffee which is weird because I've been a coffee drinker my whole life. That was two days ago I threw up and since then I've been having THE WORST stomach pain ever and diarrhea. So now I'm dealing with congestion, throwing up, fatigue, stomach pain/diarrhea and headaches. I've also been having low grade fevers that have been 99.7-99.9 but then they go down. I just feel weird. I know I don't have a cold or the flu because I've had those a lot in my life and this feels nothing like that. I just lost my medicade so I'm debating on if I should wait to see my Dr next month for our appointment or just go to the ER. Money is tight but I feel worse every day.

1. **Five Points**: Oh, Five Points. It's like the ""uptown"" of Athens, except it’s got all the charm of a college kid's Instagram feed—nice, but only real for about two weeks out of the year when the fall leaves hit just right. Otherwise, it’s a sea of overpriced homes and trendy coffee shops, where the only thing more pretentious than the barista’s apron is the size of the houses that were built way too close together.

2. **Normaltown**: Welcome to Normaltown, where the streets are as narrow as your chances of finding a parking spot. It's quirky, but in that ""I'm trying too hard to be an old-school neighborhood while still pretending to have progressive ideals"" kind of way. Sure, you can find some good dive bars, but get ready to pay for a $12 cocktail that tastes like a high school chemistry experiment.

3. **Boulevard**: Boulevard's where you go if you want a taste of Athens' more ""real"" side—though it’s more ""real"" in the sense that you might find a good deal on an old house, but it comes with some equally real neighbors who will be happy to remind you of their opinions on the local school system. It’s the neighborhood that can’t decide whether it’s hipster heaven or just a hot mess of aging houses and random roadside attractions.

4. **Pinecrest**: Pinecrest feels like the ""just outside of Athens"" spot where people who don't quite want to live in the city, but still want to say they do, end up. It's like the suburbia of your college town dreams, except it’s missing that nice, shiny charm. It's got that ""my parents bought me my first car, and I’m going to be stuck here for years after graduation"" vibe.

5. **East Athens**: If you're into the thrill of driving through neighborhoods where you’re not sure if you’re in Athens or a post-apocalyptic movie set, East Athens is calling your name. Great potential for a future in real estate speculation, though current listings might make you rethink your decision-making skills. But hey, the rent is cheap, and you might even get a glimpse of the ""real"" Athens experience — if you can find it behind all the unfinished roads and empty lots.

6. **West Athens**: West Athens sounds nice in theory, but unless you're into questionable fast food chains and the type of place where the cars parked on the street give off a ""you better lock your doors"" kind of vibe, you might want to reconsider. It's a place where everyone's just trying to get by, but the fact that you have to cross five traffic lights to get to anything remotely ""cool"" will leave you second-guessing your decision to be an adventurer.

7. **University Heights**: Ah, University Heights—where students go to get their fix of textbook-inspired ""adulting."" The houses look like a 90s sitcom set, and the ""neighborhood pride"" comes in the form of a six-week stretch of manicured lawns before finals hit. It's not quite as picturesque as it thinks it is, but it definitely has the whole “we’re so chill, we’ll party until 2 a.m.” thing down.

8. **Tallassee**: Tallassee feels like the place where people went to hide from the rest of the world, but then realized it’s only five minutes from everything they actually want to do. There’s potential for a cool, secluded vibe if you ignore the strange mix of poorly maintained yards and awkwardly empty properties. If you're into an oddly quiet, almost haunting experience, this is the spot.

Snowflakes & Citrus is just Midnight Blue Citrus repackaged, but to me it smells a little different. That Coffee candle is also very nice! Smells like you're brewing coffee! Pink Apple Punch was a surprise! I love it! As for the others, I was pretty much familiar with them. Some were on my radar and some weren't. Cinnamon Caramel Swirl won out over Caramel & Vanilla. I got the last Cranberry & Pomegranate and can't wait to burn the Cinnamon Spiced Vanilla! I work tomorrow and Sunday. Let's see how many other candles make their way back to my house. 😂",21,1733538058.0,bathandbodyworks,3,1.0,False

I made a coffee this morning, and when trying to make a second coffee this started happening. I’ve fully disassembled the grinder and cleaned it out, taking out the outer and inner burr and grind fan. Factory reset did nothing, and it appears nothing is jammed. Any ideas?

Emails most likely won't be sent over the weekend and everyone is Hella stressed. Take the next couple days to breathe and reset. Everyone has been going full throttle to get the Dec 1st deadline and now it's the waiting game. Good luck yall, take the weekend to chill and then prep for interviews next week!
