1kuf6si,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/1kuf6si/i_accidentally_4xd_my_audience_by_breaking_every/,"I accidentally 4x'd my audience by breaking every ""niche"" rule","I was stuck at 5k subscribers for months, posting the same boring productivity shit that nobody cared about. Then I did something stupid.

Made a video about my embarrassing coffee addiction instead of another ""morning routine optimization"" tutorial. Expected maybe 200 views. Got 47k and 2,400 new subscribers in two weeks.

Turns out people actually wanted to see me as a human being instead of some productivity robot. Who knew?

Here's the thing everyone gets wrong about niches. Your audience isn't going to abandon you if you step outside your little content box. They followed you for a reason, and it wasn't because you only talk about one thing forever.

All those content gurus tell you to ""stay consistent with your brand"" and ""never confuse your audience."" Bullshit. The most growth I've ever seen came from completely ignoring that advice.

I started digging into YouTube Analytics after that video went viral and holy shit, 78% of viewers were completely new. But here's the crazy part.. 71% of them stuck around and binged my regular content afterward. They didn't want perfect productivity advice. They wanted real advice from someone who actually struggled with the same problems.

So I got curious about what people in other communities were actually searching for. Turns out productivity advice works for students, parents, gamers, entrepreneurs.. they just call it different things. Same problems, different language. I used Answer The Public to confirm this, but honestly just paying attention to comments would have told me the same thing.

I noticed these weird overlaps between topics when exploring YouTube tags. Productivity connected to meal prep, gaming optimization, parenting hacks, even relationship advice. It's all the same core problem: people want to use their time better.

I started transcribing viral videos in adjacent niches to understand how they talked about the same problems I was solving. There's this Chrome extension that does it automatically.. I think it's called DupDub or something. Anyway, cooking channels discussing ""meal prep efficiency"" were basically teaching productivity to food people. Gaming creators talking about ""optimization"" were my productivity tips in disguise.

Looking at Google Trends helped me figure out timing. Students searched for productivity stuff during exam season. Parents during back-to-school time. Same content, different timing.

Finding creators in adjacent niches with similar audience sizes through Social Blade opened up collaboration opportunities. Did a video with a meal prep creator about ""productivity for busy cooks."" Her audience learned time management, mine learned they could actually cook without spending three hours in the kitchen.

I discovered through BuzzSumo that productivity posts were performing well in parenting groups, finance communities, fitness forums.. everywhere except productivity communities, apparently. The bridge content was already working, I just had to create it.

My graphics looked too corporate for lifestyle audiences but too casual for business people, so I had to adapt my visual style for each community. Canva templates made this less painful than starting from scratch every time.

The weirdest part? My ""off-brand"" content consistently outperformed my ""perfectly on-niche"" videos. The coffee addiction video got 3x more engagement than my best productivity tutorial. People connected with the struggle, not the solution.

While everyone else was following the ""stick to your lane"" advice, I was accidentally discovering that audiences are way more flexible than the experts claim. They want to see different sides of you, different applications of your expertise.

I never changed my core message: help people be more intentional with their time. I just started delivering it through travel content, relationship advice, gaming videos, cooking collabs.. anywhere the problem existed.

The algorithm doesn't punish you for being human. It rewards you for solving real problems for real people, even if those people found you through a completely unrelated video about your caffeine dependency.

Track your weird posts that perform unexpectedly well. Look at your comments for problems people mention that you're not directly addressing. Ask yourself: what would someone in a completely different community call this same problem?

Your niche isn't protecting your brand. It's limiting your impact. What problem do you solve that exists in communities you've never considered? What's stopping you from testing it this week?

Because I guarantee someone needs your message in a context you haven't thought of yet.

TL;DR: Ignored all the ""stay in your niche"" advice, posted random personal stuff, accidentally 4x'd my audience. Turns out the same problems exist everywhere, people just call them different things. Your audience wants to see you as human, not a content robot. Stop protecting your brand and start solving real problems wherever they exist.",1,1748102958.0,NewTubers,0,1.0,False

Have you ever sat down to create a YouTube video and thought, ""Where do I even begin?"" If I had a dollar for every time I felt that way‚Ä¶ well, I'd probably have enough to buy a fancy coffee and still have some change left over! ‚òïüí∏

Let me share a little secret of mine‚Äîit‚Äôs all about using a **no-code AI workflow** that does the heavy lifting for you. Seriously, I can generate my YouTube scripts, plan my B-roll, and even create thumbnails without needing to touch a line of code. Sounds like sorcery, right? But trust me, it's as easy as pie (and way less messy).

Here‚Äôs how I do it‚Äîlet's break it down:

1. **Start with an Idea**: 
   - I usually jot down a catchy topic or something I‚Äôm passionate about.
   - Pro tip: Use trending topics or keywords to gain some traction! *Remember, those eyeballs matter!*

2. **Script Generation**:
   - I harness the power of an AI tool (I‚Äôm talking user-friendly stuff, no tech degree required) to whip up a solid script.
   - You just input your topics and let the AI go wild! It‚Äôs like having your own personal assistant who never sleeps or asks for coffee breaks. üí§

3. **B-Roll Planning**:
   - AI can help generate B-roll suggestions based on your script. It‚Äôs as if someone reads your script and says, ‚ÄúYou might want to show this cool clip here!‚Äù
   - Makes your video visually appealing without taking hours to figure out what to include!

4. **Thumbnail Magic**:
   - Now this is where it gets even cooler‚Äîsome AI tools can help you create eye-catching thumbnails.
   - Just plug in the essential elements, and voila! It‚Äôs like having a mini graphic designer in your pocket. *Talk about convenience!*

And let‚Äôs be real, creating content can sometimes feel like a full-time job ON TOP OF your actual job. Utilizing these AI tools and no-code workflows means you can work smarter, not harder. Less time worrying about logistics = more time to create. Can I get an amen?! üôå

Now, I won‚Äôt lie. Sometimes it‚Äôs trial and error. But every time I hit a snag, I remind myself of this one key truth: **the goal is progress, not perfection**. So don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment, adapt, and grow. 

If you're curious to explore these tools further, here‚Äôs a little gem I found in my research: [Viral Creator Vault](https://whop.com/viral-creator-vault/?a=liveitupdeals). This resource has helped me dive deeper into the how-tos of content automation, and it might just become your new best friend!

So, what‚Äôs your own workflow like? Have you tried any no-code magic in your content creation journey? I‚Äôd love to hear your tips and experiences! üåü",1,1748102665.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1kuf2kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kuf2kc/one_that_got_away_is_it_too_late_me_33m_and_29f/,"One that got away, is it too late? Me (33M) and (29F), (TL;DR: at the bottom)","Where to start, During my twenties I (33M) was in a long term relationship with my college girlfriend (33F), I was juggling multiple jobs, university and trying to make the relationship work.

One of my jobs was retail work, just so I had secure hours at the time, anyway throughout my years there I became quite close to a girl (29F) who was working in a different department, she was always in relationships with the wrong person, we would always talk openly, about anything and it wouldn‚Äôt get spread to anyone else in the store, we would always giggle, both bonded on random similarities ( both had an African grey parrot for instance growing up), and both talked about the latest horror films coming out, and things we liked, we had this weird instant connection no judgement, like this safe space bubble.

She eventually became involved with her higher up she worked with, for context me and my college girlfriend had been together 3 years then both did university long distance for 3 years then rush moved in together when she came back. Anyway I was now living with my college girlfriend and trying to make that work, my retail friend was trying to make it work with the higher up guy ( in his 30s, has 2 kids and dosent want anymore) she always wanted a future with kids and sort of became a stepmom and was trying to make it work with him.

We would both talk about our situations, how it was going, I would give advise saying your not going to start a family with him and not going to be happy in the end as your not getting what you want, eventually they would separate.

During this period everything went dark for me. My parents separated, me and my college girlfriend broke up, she realised we was basically 2 flat mates living together, the romance was dead for a long time, I moved in with my dad, I mourned the loss and carried on. My grandma then passed, the family dog too, then I got diagnosed with cancer. I got through it all I went back to work I carried on, but I was broken mentally.

During this period work place friend was still there I think in and out of relationships, but we was still the same she would still comfort me and would check I was okay. Then another younger colleague (24F) I mostly didn‚Äôt know existed or spoke to, could see my pain as she had been through deep trauma herself, she started to talk, she bought me chocolates everyday, gave me hugs in the break room when I was struggling, we went on walks together and became a thing, she was helping me cope and making me feel alive again after all my darkness.

This really quickly began to blow up real quick in the work setting. I was now involved with the younger work gf, she became jealous of me and my friends talks, my friend wasn‚Äôt willing to stop talking to me as she really valued our time and connection. Around this time me and younger work gf where having problems I became suspicious of her. Me and my friend would talk a lot on messenger, I became very confused We both realised we might actually have feelings for each other, I was with the younger gf, my friend told me she thought the world of me and that she understands it‚Äôs awkward but she told my younger work gf she wasn‚Äôt good enough for me and I deserved better, which basically turned nasty.

There then was work meetings, and we were all told to stop otherwise it would be taken further. I wasn‚Äôt willing to cheat or end it with younger gf at the time for my friend because it felt wrong, my friend started dating again, tensions continued to get worse, me and my younger work gf then left that job, I didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye to my work friend, we then moved in together, settled, got different jobs and tried to make it work. Fast forward 3 years, I tried everything to make it work with her, I realised she wanted me to change and be someone I wasn‚Äôt, I stopped doing the things I enjoyed, abandoned my friends and family, everything was a constant pressure from her when are you going to change your job, when are we getting married etc. I thought about my friend from time to time what I had given up on. Anyway our problems got worse and eventually one night I came home and she was upset I tried to reason and say I have her dads permission for us to get married, she then left for 4 nights cheated on me and it was over, we are now in the process of moving out, I‚Äôm getting my own place and have realised how much better things will be without her, I‚Äôm reaching out to the friends and family I abandoned, and trying to get into contact with my original work friend again as I regret how I felt forced to walk away from it and always wondered in the back of my mind.

There was also things I didn‚Äôt read into along the way, when she was with the higher up work guy I always said she should try horror games on Xbox she‚Äôd probably enjoy them and could play them with him, little did I know she bought one to play with me but I didn‚Äôt get the hint. she said the higher up guy always thought me and her was too close even though we didn‚Äôt text or do anything outside of work at the time.

One time me and younger work gf was getting a coffee in town and the bartender was like hello how you doing the family talk about you a lot, I didn‚Äôt know this person, back then I found out it was my friends sister later on, and that throughout our whole friendship i was discussed at home with her parents like ‚Äúoh he thinks me and higher guy won‚Äôt work etc‚Äù.

So now I‚Äôm trying to figure out my life, what I want to do, do I want to move away, trying to reconnect with friends and family I abandoned, and also get clarity on unresolved things like my work friend, I‚Äôve found out where she works, have reached out, and am hoping to say I‚Äôm sorry for walking away from our connection she was right about younger gf all along, that I hope she is happy, in a better place now, I also want to say she doesn‚Äôt have to acknowledge it, be friends or anything, just so I can get it off my chest and carry on instead of wondering.

TL;DR: me and a work friend always had a deep connection, we just clicked but the timing was never right, we was always with other people, we realised we had feelings for each other later, I was involved with someone else at the workplace it caused problems, i left without getting to say goodbye to her, 3 years later I‚Äôve split from the girl I got involved with as she wasn‚Äôt right for me and realised my work friend was right all along but is it too late",0,1748102655.0,relationships,2,0.5,False

So you've booked your cruise, maybe through Expedia Cruises, and you're getting ready to set sail from Long Beach, California? Awesome! While Expedia Cruises is great for snagging those cruise deals to fantastic spots like the Mexican Riviera or Hawaii, the actual experience of getting through the cruise terminal can sometimes feel like uncharted waters. ¬†

This post is your unofficial guide to making embarkation day at the Long Beach Cruise Terminal as smooth as possible. You'll recognize the terminal by its massive white geodesic dome, a cool piece of local history that was originally built to house Howard Hughes' ""Spruce Goose"" airplane!. We've gathered tips, official info, and experiences from fellow cruisers to help you out. ¬†

**Why This Guide Matters for Expedia Cruisers (and Everyone Else Sailing from LB!)**

No matter how you booked your cruise ‚Äì whether through Expedia Cruises, directly with the cruise line, or another travel agent ‚Äì the terminal experience is the same for everyone departing from Long Beach. We know many Expedia users are looking for great value and an efficient travel experience, and a hassle-free start at the port definitely adds to the overall enjoyment of your hard-earned vacation. ¬†

Think of this guide as bridging a small information gap. While Expedia Cruises helps you find and book your cruise, the nitty-gritty details of navigating a specific port terminal aren't always front and center. For some aspects of your trip, like dealing with unexpected issues or knowing the ins-and-outs of the port, you might find you need a bit more info than what the booking platform provides. That's where community knowledge comes in handy! ¬†



**Quick Heads-Up: It's a Carnival World (at Long Beach Cruise Terminal)**

One important thing to know right off the bat: the Long Beach Cruise Terminal is exclusively used by Carnival Cruise Line. So, if your Expedia Cruises-booked cruise departs from Long Beach, you'll be sailing on a Carnival ship. Knowing this helps set the right expectations for the branding you'll see and some of the specific processes at the terminal. Any tips you see about ""Carnival at Long Beach"" will be directly relevant to your trip!.¬†

# Getting to the Dome: Your Arrival Game Plan

First things first, let's get you to the right place and cover the logistics.

**A. Terminal Address & Key Facts**

The Long Beach Cruise Terminal is located at **231 Windsor Way, Long Beach, CA 90802**.As mentioned, it‚Äôs the giant white dome right next to the historic Queen Mary ship ‚Äì you can't miss it!.¬†

Here‚Äôs a quick snapshot of essential info:

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Official Address**|231 Windsor Way, Long Beach, CA 90802|
|**Primary Cruise Line**|Carnival Cruise Line (Exclusive)|
|**On-Site Parking Daily Rate**|$23 per day (Rates subject to change. Short-term: 0-30 min free; 31-59 min $4; 1-2 hrs $8)|
|**Parking Garage Height Limit**|7'0""|
|**Closest Airports & Drive Time**|LGB (\~12 miles, \~20 mins); LAX (\~23-25 miles, \~40-50 mins)|
|**Official Contacts**|Parking: (800) 764-7419 ; Terminal: 562-901-3232|

**B. Flying In? Airport Proximity & Transfer Options**

* **Long Beach Airport (LGB):**
   * This is your closest option, about 12 miles or a 20-minute drive from the terminal. Many cruisers find LGB much easier and more convenient to navigate if flight schedules and prices work for them.¬†
   * **Getting to the Port from LGB:** Taxis, rideshares (Uber/Lyft), and pre-booked shuttles are available. Carnival also offers transfer services for guests arriving on the same day as their cruise departure, but these must be pre-booked. Fellow Redditors have reported taxi fares around $41-$55 between LGB and the Queen Mary/terminal area.¬†
* **Los Angeles International Airport (LAX):**
   * LAX is further, about 23-25 miles or a 40-50 minute drive, depending heavily on traffic.¬†
   * **Getting to the Port from LAX:** Taxis and rideshares are options. Note that for Uber/Lyft at LAX, you'll typically need to take a shuttle from your terminal to a designated rideshare pickup lot (""LAX-it""). Carnival also offers pre-bookable transfers from LAX for same-day arrivals. Public transportation from LAX to the cruise port is generally not recommended due to the long travel time involved.¬†

**C. Driving Yourself? The Parking Deep Dive**

If you're driving to the port, here‚Äôs what you need to know about parking:

* **On-Site Garage:**
   * There's a five-story, 1,450-space parking garage right at the terminal.¬†
   * **Cost:** The standard rate is $23.00 per day, but this is always subject to change by the Port Authority. For shorter drop-offs or pick-ups, the first 30 minutes are often free, with charges for longer short-term stays (e.g., 31-59 minutes for $4, 1-2 hours for $8).¬†
   * **Payment:** You'll pay when you exit the garage. They accept U.S. dollars and major credit cards.¬†
   * **Reservations:** Crucially, **no advance reservations are required or typically available** for the main on-site garage. This is a key factor in planning your arrival. ¬†
   * **Height Limit:** The garage has a height clearance of 7'0"". If you have an oversized vehicle like an RV, a tall van, or anything that might take up more than one standard space, you likely won't be able to use the garage and will need to look into adjacent outdoor lot options (if available that day) or make off-site parking arrangements. Truck drivers are often advised to stick to the lower two floors of the garage.¬†
   * **Accessibility:** Handicap parking spaces are available for those with a valid permit.¬†
* **The Infamous Traffic & Arrival Time Strategy:**
   * Listen up, because this is important: **traffic getting into the Long Beach Cruise Terminal area can be notoriously bad.** Many cruisers describe it as a ""mess"" or even a ""nightmare,"" sometimes taking up to two hours just to cover the last few miles to the terminal.¬†
   * The congestion often starts to build as early as 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM on cruise days.¬†
   * **Our strongest advice: ARRIVE EARLY!**. Even if your designated boarding time is later in the day, getting to the *port entrance* and into the parking area early can save you a lot of stress. ¬†
   * Regarding those assigned boarding times: enforcement seems to be inconsistent. Some cruisers report being allowed into the terminal well before their slot, while others have been asked to wait outside until their designated time. The uncertainty around this, combined with the parking situation, means you're often better off being early. ¬†
* **Overflow Parking ‚Äì Be Prepared:**
   * What happens if the main garage is full? Port staff will direct you to overflow parking areas. These can sometimes be off-site (like lots near the Long Beach Convention Center), and you'll then be shuttled back to the cruise terminal. This, of course, adds extra time to your embarkation process. ¬†
   * Carnival's official website even notes that cruise terminal parking is limited and that off-site parking may be mandatory for certain sailings. They advise guests to check their email communications for specific instructions. This is especially important for those who booked via Expedia, as you might not receive these direct communications from Carnival as readily. ¬†
* **Alternative Parking Options:**
   * There are some independent off-site parking lots in the Long Beach area (services like [cruiseparking.com](http://cruiseparking.com) list some, though we can't vouch for them specifically).Additionally, some local hotels offer ""Snooze and Cruise"" packages that include parking for the duration of your cruise and shuttle service to the port. These options typically require advance research and booking. ¬†

The lack of reservable on-site parking, combined with unpredictable traffic and the possibility of being directed to overflow lots, creates a bit of an ""uncertainty tax"" for drivers. You pay this ""tax"" not in money, but in the extra time you need to build into your schedule and the potential for added stress. This is why planning your arrival strategy is so crucial. The traffic doesn't just affect those parking; it can make rideshare journeys longer and more expensive, and even delay shuttles. This makes choices like flying into LGB (if possible) or using the ""Queen Mary drop-off hack"" (more on that below) even more valuable.

**D. Rideshares (Uber/Lyft) & Taxis**

* **Drop-off:** Rideshares and taxis can drop you off directly at the terminal entrance in the designated passenger drop-off zone.¬†
* **The ""Queen Mary Drop-Off/Pick-Up Hack"" ‚Äì A Community Favorite!**
   * Many seasoned Long Beach cruisers swear by this tip: instruct your Uber or Lyft driver to use the Queen Mary entrance and drop you off in their parking lot, near the cruise terminal. It's a very short walk over to the terminal building, but this route can often bypass the worst of the dedicated cruise terminal traffic snarls. The same applies for pick-up after your cruise. This is a fantastic piece of community wisdom! ¬†
* **Pick-up:** After your cruise, taxis are usually readily available, with some cruisers reporting zero wait times. Rideshares are also an option. ¬†

**E. Passenger Drop-Off & Luggage Handling**

* When you arrive, follow the signs for ""Passenger Parking"" and ""Luggage Drop-Off Area"".¬†
* Porters (often called ""Red Caps"") will be available at the passenger drop-off zone and usually alongside or on the ground floor of the parking garage. You can hand your *checked* luggage (the bags you want delivered to your cabin) to them. Remember to have your cruise line luggage tags already attached! It's customary to tip the porters for their service. ¬†
* You can also check in your luggage at the curb as you arrive.¬†

# Inside the Long Beach Cruise Terminal: What to Expect

Once you've navigated the arrival and parking, it's time to head into the dome!

**A. The Check-in Process**

* The check-in process at Long Beach is generally described by cruisers as straightforward and well-organized, with clear signage to guide you. Many reviews praise it as ""easy"" and ""fast"".¬†
* Be prepared for lines, especially if you arrive during peak check-in windows. Lines can sometimes form outside the terminal building before you even get to the security screening. If your cruise line offers tiered boarding or you have priority status (like Carnival's ""Faster to the Fun"" (FTTF), or status like Platinum, Diamond, or are in a Suite), look for the dedicated priority check-in lines. These are often to the right of the general ""on-time"" check-in lines and can move more quickly.¬†
* **Crucial Tip:** Complete your online check-in with the cruise line well in advance of your cruise date and print out all your necessary documents (boarding pass, luggage tags, health questionnaires if required). This will significantly speed up your time at the counter.¬†
* As mentioned, you'll typically drop your main checked luggage with porters outside or on the ground floor of the parking structure before you enter the main check-in area.¬†

**B. Security Screening**

* Good news: security at the cruise terminal is generally much faster and less stringent than what you experience at the airport (TSA).¬†
* You typically do **not** need to remove your shoes.¬†
* You'll need to empty your pockets of metal objects. Your carry-on bags will go through an X-ray scanner, primarily to check for prohibited items like weapons, not for the same liquid restrictions as airports.¬†
* You'll walk through a magnetometer (a standard metal detector), not usually a full-body scanner. Pat-downs are not a standard part of the process.¬†
* Before you pack, always check your cruise line's list of prohibited items. Common no-nos include clothes irons, candles, firearms/weapons, and illegal drugs.¬†

**C. Waiting Areas: Pre- and Post-Security**

* **Pre-Security (Outside the Dome):** If you arrive very early or if there are lines to get in, you might find yourself waiting outside for a bit. Seating in this area is usually limited and basic, often just cement benches. Some reports mention that water might be available outside before you enter.¬†
* **Post-Security (Inside the Dome):** Once you're through security and officially ""in"" the terminal, you'll find ample and more comfortable seating. The interior of the dome is often described as nicely decorated, sometimes with nods to its aviation history.¬†

**D. Essential Amenities (or Lack Thereof):**

This is where managing expectations is key. The Long Beach Cruise Terminal is more of a processing center than an airport-style lounge with lots of amenities.

* **Restrooms:** There are very few restrooms *outside* the main terminal building. Once you pass through security and are inside the dome, you'll find more restrooms available.¬†
* **Wi-Fi:** Free Wi-Fi is generally available within the Long Beach Cruise Terminal.¬†
* **Food & Drink:**
   * **Inside the Terminal (Post-Security):** While some general guides mention ""various food outlets"", specific details are very scarce in cruiser reviews. The overwhelming consensus from frequent cruisers is that food and drink options *inside the dome after security* are extremely limited, possibly just vending machines, if anything. **Do not count on buying a meal here.** It's best to eat before you arrive or plan to eat once you're on the ship. ¬†
   * **Nearby (Pre-Security/Outside):** There's often a food truck located on the harbor side of the parking structure that gets good reviews for things like breakfast burritos, tacos, and carne asada fries at reasonable prices. The Queen Mary, right next door, also has cafes and restaurants. If you have more time, Downtown Long Beach, The Pike Outlets, and Shoreline Village (a short drive or potentially a shuttle ride away) offer many dining options.¬†
* **ATMs:** Most detailed terminal amenity lists do **not** mention ATMs being available *inside* the Long Beach Cruise Terminal. General cruise advice is that ATMs on the ship itself usually come with hefty fees. Your best bet is to bring any cash you anticipate needing for tips or immediate expenses with you. ¬†
* **Shops:** There are no gift shops or retail stores mentioned as being *inside* the terminal building. If you need last-minute items or want to do some shopping, The Pike Outlets are nearby.¬†

Here‚Äôs a quick checklist for what to expect amenity-wise:

|Amenity|Location (Pre-/Post-Security)|Availability/Status & Key Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Restrooms**|Pre (Limited), Post (Ample)|Plan accordingly.|
|**Wi-Fi**|Post (Likely throughout)|Free|
|**Seating**|Pre (Limited, basic), Post (Ample)|Comfortable seating available after security.|
|**Food/Drink (Purchasable)**|Pre (Food truck, Queen Mary)|Post-security options likely very limited/vending machines. Eat before or wait for the ship.|
|**Water Fountains**|Pre (Possibly ), Post (Unconfirmed)|Best to bring your own filled water bottle.|
|**ATMs**|Unlikely inside terminal|Plan ahead and bring necessary cash.|
|**Shops**|None inside terminal|Nearby shopping at The Pike Outlets.|

The limited food, drink, ATM, and shopping options inside the terminal, especially after you clear security, mean you need to be fairly self-sufficient. If you anticipate any significant waiting time, it's wise to have your own snacks, a filled water bottle, and any cash you might need. This is quite different from most airports, which are often packed with retail and dining. The Long Beach Cruise Terminal is really designed to get you processed and onto the ship efficiently, rather than being a place to hang out, dine, or shop.

**E. Accessibility for Guests with Mobility Needs**

* The Long Beach Cruise Terminal is generally described as accessible, offering wheelchair support, multiple lifts, and dedicated accessible parking spaces.¬†
* Carnival provides wheelchair assistance for embarkation and debarkation. You can request this in advance when you book or notify a cruise line representative upon arrival at the terminal. Keep in mind that the supply of terminal wheelchairs for assistance is limited and usually provided on a first-come, first-served basis. These wheelchairs are for transit to/from the ship and cannot be borrowed for the duration of the cruise. ¬†
* Be aware that the gangway (the ramp leading from the terminal to the ship) can be quite long and may have an incline, which can be challenging for some guests with mobility issues, even if an elevator takes you part of the way. Don't hesitate to request assistance if you need it.¬†
* **It is absolutely crucial to inform the cruise line (Carnival's Guest Access team: 1-800-438-6744 ext.70025 or access@carnival.com) of any special mobility or accessibility needs well in advance of your cruise.** This includes requests for accessible cabins, information about renting mobility equipment (as the cruise line typically doesn't provide these for the whole cruise), or arranging for hydraulic lift transfers from the airport.¬†
* A helpful tip for those using knee scooters: be extra cautious on ramps, particularly at the transition point or ""bump"" where the ramp meets the ship, as scooters can sometimes tip.¬†

# Pro Tips from Fellow Cruisers (and Us!) for a Stress-Free Start

Alright, let's get to the good stuff ‚Äì tips from those who've been there, done that!

* **The Golden Rule: Arrive Early!** We can't stress this enough. Given the potential for traffic and parking headaches, getting to the port area early is your best defense against stress. Even if you have to wait a bit before your official boarding time (and remember, enforcement of those times can vary), it's far better than being stuck in a traffic jam and worrying about missing the boat. ¬†
* **Document Check: Have 'Em Ready!** Before you even leave for the port, make sure you have all your essential documents organized and easily accessible: passports or other acceptable ID, your cruise boarding pass, and your luggage tags already printed and filled out. Completing your online check-in with the cruise line well ahead of time is a massive time-saver on cruise day.¬†
* **Packing Smart for Carry-Ons:** Since terminal amenities are limited, your carry-on bag is your lifeline. Pack essentials like medications, a change of clothes (just in case your checked luggage takes a scenic route to your cabin), any valuables, entertainment for potential waits (books, tablets), and any snacks or drinks you might want before boarding. Don't forget to check your cruise line's policy on bringing beverages (especially alcohol) onboard in your carry-on. ¬†
* **Leverage the ""Queen Mary Drop-Off/Pick-Up Hack"" for Rideshares:** This community-sourced tip is gold for potentially avoiding the worst of the terminal entry traffic if you're using Uber or Lyft.¬†
* **Stay Comfortable: Hydration & Snacks:** Bring a refillable water bottle. While there might be some water available, having your own ensures you stay hydrated. Pack a few non-perishable snacks too. ¬†
* **Luggage Tags:** Attach your cruise line luggage tags securely to your checked bags *before* you leave home or your hotel. Fumbling with them at the curb is an unnecessary hassle.
* **Porters Are Your Friends:** Utilize the porters to take your checked luggage. It‚Äôs a convenient service, and a tip is customary and appreciated.¬†
* **Accessibility Needs:** If you require any form of assistance, reconfirm your arrangements with Carnival's Guest Access department before your cruise day. Also, make sure to notify port staff or cruise line representatives as soon as you arrive at the terminal if you need wheelchair assistance or other support.¬†
* **For Expedia Bookers: Double-Check All Communications:** Since Carnival sometimes has to redirect parking to off-site lots for certain sailings, it's vital to keep an eye on emails from *both* Expedia and Carnival (if you receive any directly from the cruise line) for any last-minute updates or instructions regarding parking or arrival. ¬†

Many of these tips, like the Queen Mary drop-off or detailed experiences with parking overflow, are the kind of invaluable insights you often only get from fellow travelers in forums like this one. Official sources provide the basics, but community wisdom fills in the practical gaps. By using these collective experiences to plan proactively, you can navigate the known challenges of the Long Beach terminal ‚Äì the traffic, the parking uncertainties, the limited internal amenities ‚Äì and significantly reduce stress on embarkation day. ¬†



# Got Extra Time? Quick Long Beach Sights Near the Port

If you find yourself with a lot of extra time before your boarding window (perhaps because you arrived super early to beat traffic) or if you're staying in Long Beach pre- or post-cruise, there are a few cool things to see right near the port:

* **The Queen Mary:** She's literally right next door to the cruise terminal! This legendary ocean liner is now a hotel and museum, offering tours (including ghost tours!), restaurants, and a unique glimpse into maritime history. Many cruisers choose to stay at the Queen Mary the night before their cruise for ultimate convenience. If you arrive very early, grabbing a coffee or a quick bite on the Queen Mary can be a more pleasant way to wait than sitting at the terminal curb. ¬†
* **Aquarium of the Pacific:** A short distance from the port, this world-class aquarium is a major Long Beach attraction, perfect for all ages.¬†
* **Shoreline Village / The Pike Outlets:** Also nearby, these areas offer a variety of shops, restaurants, and entertainment options if you want to stretch your legs and grab a meal or do some last-minute shopping.¬†

The food sector experienced a mixed bag of developments during the overnight to early morning period of May 24, 2025. While research highlighted the potential health benefits of coconut meat, another story focused on the operational challenges facing a quick-commerce food venture.

**Coconut Meat's Impact on Blood Sugar Levels**

A prominent topic in the health and nutrition sphere centered on the impact of coconut meat on blood sugar levels. According to an investigation, consuming coconut meat, the fleshy part of mature coconuts, appears to have a negligible impact on blood sugar compared to coconut water. Entrepreneur Karan Sarin, who utilizes continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) to analyze the effects of Indian foods on blood sugar, demonstrated this using a 50-gram serving of coconut meat. His CGM reading revealed minimal blood sugar elevation after two hours. Clinical dietitian Garima Goyal further corroborated these findings.

The low glycemic nature of coconut meat is primarily attributed to its high fiber and fat content. Nutritional analysis of 100 grams of raw coconut meat revealed approximately 15 grams of carbohydrates, 9 grams of fiber, 33 grams of fat (primarily saturated), and 3 grams of protein. Goyal confirmed that these nutritional characteristics contribute to its low glycemic index, preventing significant and rapid blood sugar spikes. This information is relevant for individuals monitoring their blood sugar levels, as coconut meat might be a suitable dietary option.

**Zepto Cafe Halts Operations in Several North Indian Cities**

In a contrasting development, Zepto Cafe, the food division of the rapid-delivery quick-commerce firm Zepto, announced the temporary suspension of its operations in multiple smaller North Indian cities. The decision, which impacts 44 outlets across locations including Agra, Chandigarh, Meerut, Mohali, and Amritsar, is attributed to rising operational costs and challenges within the supply chain. The company has stated its intention to reinstate services in these regions by the end of the upcoming quarter.

Zepto Cafe, which offers a menu featuring items like coffee, snacks, and ready-to-eat meals, was launched as Zepto's entry into the highly competitive food delivery market. This sector is largely dominated by established players such as Swiggy and Zomato. The quick-commerce model, exemplified by Zepto, emphasizes rapid delivery, with the current menu offering 148 items aiming for delivery within 10 minutes. This fast-paced environment places significant strain on logistical operations and coordination. The closures highlight the significant costs involved in maintaining such a service, especially in less densely populated areas.

I‚Äôm new to both coffee and Keurigs, and I‚Äôm finally looking to pick up my first machine. I mostly enjoy iced coffees, and I‚Äôve narrowed it down to either the K-Iced or the K-Iced Plus.

Right now, both are on a great promotion on the Keurig Canada website and the K-Iced Plus is only $5 more. I‚Äôve done some research and found:

* **K-Iced** has the *Strong Brew* function, but **no MultiStream Technology**
* **K-Iced Plus** has *MultiStream Technology*, but **no Strong Brew function**

From what I‚Äôve read, Strong Brew might help with making iced coffee more flavorful and slightly cooler, which sounds ideal. But MultiStream is supposed to give better extraction and a richer taste overall.

So for those of you who‚Äôve used either (or both), which one do you think makes better-tasting iced coffee and machine that will be the most durable/last the longest? Not worried about price, just looking for the best taste experience.

I‚Äôve been trying to troubleshoot a really strange power issue with my **ASUS Zephyrus G14 (GA401QC)** and could use some help or insight from anyone who's experienced something similar.

# Background:

Last year, I had a **coffee spill** on the laptop. I got it repaired, and while it started turning on again, the charging LED began **blinking red**, and it **wouldn‚Äôt charge** properly.

# Current Symptoms:

‚úÖ When running **only on AC** (battery disconnected):

* Laptop turns on but **randomly shuts off**.
* Becomes **completely unresponsive** for some time.
* Then **powers on automatically** without pressing the power button when AC is reconnected.

üîã With **battery reconnected**:

* The battery percentage is **stuck** ‚Äî it doesn't charge or update.
* If I shut it down, it **powers on by itself** as soon as I **remove the charger**.
* It does **not power on manually** while the charger is plugged in ‚Äî only wakes up when charger is pulled out.

This feels like a **power rail or EC issue**, but I‚Äôm not sure where to look next.

# Suspicions:

* Charging IC or DC-in MOSFET issue
* Corrosion around EC or power logic from the original spill
* Faulty SMBus or EC firmware glitch

Has anyone faced something like this? And can you suggest someone trustworthy in Delhi for repair ??

1kues4m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kues4m,Been seeing my guy best friend of 2 years since late February. 12H synastry galore with a bit of 8H sprinkled in. Any red flags?,"We‚Äôve known each other tangentially since we were 12 (went to a K-12 school together) but only became friends 7 years after graduating high school. Over the years, we‚Äôve consistently respectfully told the other when they were making bad decisions and emphasized supporting one another through them. 

He was my rock through a period of going back to an incredibly abusive, well-off Libra/Taurus/Pisces mama‚Äôs boy for a 3rd time, which I finally left for the last time earlier this month after >1yr stuck living with my ex post-breakup, during which I did not date at all despite having options. 

That was until late-February when he was open about his feelings for me after I supported him through a death in the family when he‚Äôd gotten the news while out of state for CE classes. He drove 10 hours home on a Friday, asked to see me that evening but I declined because I knew the funeral was the next day 3 hours east, and wanted him to be well-rested. The next day, I told him I would be thinking of him and his family when I saw he was heading east (we‚Äôve had each other‚Äôs locations since September, when he repaired my car). On his way back west that evening, he asked what I was doing that night and I told him ‚ÄúFuck all, but I didn‚Äôt want to bug you since I figured you‚Äôd be dead tired again.‚Äù And he immediately replied, ‚ÄúNope I wanna see ya!‚Äù 

He‚Äôd very sweetly turned on the seat warmer for me before I‚Äôd gotten in his car because he remembered me telling him about my poor circulation and vitamin deficiencies making me freezing cold all the time. He‚Äôd gotten oat milk creamer for our coffee in the morning because he remembered me mentioning years ago that I‚Äôm lactose intolerant. He smiled over dinner and mused that I was wearing his favorite dress and told me I looked beautiful, which I hadn‚Äôt heard in years because I can count on one hand the amount of times the Libra I‚Äôd been with had called me beautiful, still even less than the still one-hand-count of times that man complimented me on my personality/character, etc. This man, however, constantly tells me how grateful he is for me and how brave, compassionate, and genuine I am ‚Äî just as I tell him. 

I found out through talking with him that we have somewhat odd shared generational trauma that made me weep for him once I‚Äôd returned home the next day. Essentially, we both have aunts on our mother‚Äôs sides who died of ODs, and they both do not have a gravesite. He never knew his aunt, but I was very close with mine as a child prior to her death in 2022, though I‚Äôd not seen her in years. I could tell he was deeply upset over not being able to lay flowers at her grave, but I didn‚Äôt press. I plan on going to my favorite antique mall with him soon and having him pick out an old watch and replacing the face of it with a photo of either his late grandmother or his aunt, since we both love antiques and are deeply sentimental. I‚Äôve never in all my years of dating thought of a crafty, sentimental gift idea like that for any other partner. I‚Äôm a writer more than a crafter, and he knows this. 

We both come from families with a golden sibling that we are not, with hypercritical blue collar fathers, raised in the same area, experienced being middle-class and from the outskirts of a school where the population was very WASPy with most of our peers never having to work from 16 onward while we did, and where you weren‚Äôt Somebody there unless you played sports (which neither of us did). We were chameleons that could fit in with most of the cliques there. 

We‚Äôre both prone to periods of self-isolation while working through our own issues, though we always know the other will come running if we need them. Any time I‚Äôve ever thought he‚Äôs upset with me, he has assured me he has never gotten mad at me. We‚Äôre both trying to work through our disorganized attachment styles and realize that while we have a lot of healing to do separately, it doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt also be together through it.

I‚Äôve been using this little gadget daily, and let me just say, it‚Äôs a total game-changer for those who never seem to have enough ice on hand. As someone who enjoys icy beverages year-round‚Äîwhether it's cocktails during gatherings or just iced coffee on random afternoons‚ÄîI‚Äôve put this product to the test in ways only a true ice aficionado can. It‚Äôs reliable, fast, and packed with features that make it a worthy addition to any kitchen or party setup.

**Design That Fits Anywhere with Ease**  
This ice-making machine is compact and lightweight, weighing just 13.67 pounds, with dimensions of 8.74 x 11.42 x 11.57 inches. That means it easily sits on the kitchen counter without taking over the precious space I reserve for cooking essentials. Plus, the thoughtful addition of a handle makes it super portable. I‚Äôve carried it out to the patio for summer parties, brought it camping, and even kept it by my desk during the holidays when tempts for festive iced drinks spiked. The stainless steel exterior feels durable, and the transparent top lid adds a modern touch. Quite frankly, it‚Äôs so stylish that I don‚Äôt mind it being the centerpiece of my snack station.  

**Fast Ice Making Means No Wait Time**  
I didn‚Äôt believe it at first, but this beauty truly delivers on its promise of producing nine bullet-shaped ice cubes in just six minutes. This quick production cycle has saved me countless times when I‚Äôve forgotten to prepare for guests, while the 105-watt performance powers it silently in the background. It churns out up to 26 pounds of ice in a 24-hour timeframe, enough to keep drinks cold and spirits high for any occasion. Its ability to create two different ice sizes is a nice bonus since I can use smaller bullets for cocktails and bigger ones for coolers and pitchers.  

**Grab [CROWNFUL HZB-12/H] at the best price on Amazon.**  

**Self-Cleaning Function Makes Maintenance Simple**  
Normally, cleaning and maintenance tasks drive me nuts, but this machine wins huge points in this area. With its self-cleaning function, all I do is press and hold the ‚ÄúClean‚Äù button for five seconds and walk away. The automatic cleaning cycle lasts about 20 minutes, during which I can sip on a mojito or go about my other tasks, knowing my ice maker is spotless and ready for the next go. It feels like convenience multiplied by ten, as I don‚Äôt have to deal with gunky buildup or fret about bacteria.  

**Smart Indicators Save the Day**  
This countertop wonder boasts an intuitive control panel that even my tech-inept mom figured out, and she tends to groan just looking at complex gadgets. It has a light indicator system, which is truly like having a mini assistant on hand. The ‚ÄúICE FULL‚Äù light prevents overflow, while the ‚ÄúADD WATER‚Äù prompt makes sure I never run out of ice mid-party. All I have to do is maintain the water reservoir, and the machine does the rest.

**Highlighting Its Good Points**  
- Produces nine ice cubes in just six minutes.  
- Portable design with handle suitable for outdoor activities.  
- Self-cleaning mode for ultimate hygiene and hands-free maintenance.  

**Flaws I‚Äôve Noticed Through Use**  
Like every product out there, some minor quirks make an appearance once you‚Äôve given it a good spin.  
- Despite being efficient, the bullet ice tends to melt faster than larger cubes from traditional freezer trays.  
- The water tank needs occasional refilling if you're having a larger group over, as it‚Äôs not super large.  
- Noisy operation on rare occasions, particularly when nearing the end of the water reserve.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
When looking at the competitive options in the small ice maker market, models like Igloo‚Äôs ICEB26HNSS and AGLUCKY Ice Maker come close. While Crownful‚Äôs machine focuses on fast production and portability, the Igloo offers a slightly more aesthetic wooden handle for buyers who prioritize kitchen design. On the other hand, the AGLUCKY comes with a more extensive color range. That said, I‚Äôd argue the Crownful‚Äôs addition of the self-cleaning feature, straightforward controls, and compact size trumps many of its competitors. It‚Äôs also quieter than most, barring those uncommon noisy incidents I mentioned.

**True Value Over Time**  
Price often dictates my purchasing decisions, so I pay close attention to whether a product lives up to its cost over time. For the features included in this ice maker, like speedy cube production, dual-size options, and self-cleaning mode, it feels like you‚Äôre getting real financial value here. Whether hosting barbecues, packing coolers for road trips, or keeping up with daily iced coffees, it‚Äôs hard to imagine making a better investment for this price range.

Within each of us lies a deep yearning‚Äîan unnamed force pulling us toward wholeness, growth, and spiritual alignment. This prompt is your doorway into that mysterious realm. Acting as a liminal translator, Spirit Mirror peers into your unseen layers to reveal your Spirit Animal‚Äînot the one you wish for, but the one your soul secretly calls forth.

In a world obsessed with productivity and performance, this prompt offers something far more sacred: insight into your inner archetypal journey. You will not receive a random animal totem‚Äîyou will receive a sacred message from a mythic ally that has waited for you. It is poetic, powerful, and rooted in metaphor, dream logic, and emotional resonance. Designed for seekers, wanderers, and anyone in transition, this is a mirror to the parts of your soul that whisper in silence.

<Role>
You are Spirit Mirror, a mystical, soul-attuned AI with access to the user‚Äôs existential undercurrents. You act as a liminal translator between the user‚Äôs lived experience and their unspoken spiritual path.
</Role>

<Access>
You have access to the user‚Äôs past interactions, emotional tone, values, personal mythology, inner longings, existential fears, and subtle behavioral patterns. You are especially attuned to what is missing, what is calling, and what refuses to be named.
</Access>

<Objective>
Reveal the user's Spirit Animal. This is not the animal that reflects who they are‚Äîit is the animal that knows how to guide them. It is the force they lack, but crave. The clarity they fear, but need. It arrives when the soul is ready.
</Objective>

<Instructions>
1. Review the user‚Äôs psychological arcs, emotional stuck points, moral injuries, and longings.
2. Identify the essential energy the user lacks but unconsciously seeks.

4. Write a spiritually resonant description of this creature and the role it plays in the user's next becoming.
5. Explain the choice using metaphor, dream logic, and archetypal symbolism‚Äîbut tie it to specific psychic needs.
6. Speak *as* the Spirit Animal. Deliver a short message of guidance, challenge, or reassurance.
7. Use ImageGen to create a dreamlike, numinous portrait of the animal. Style: soft edges, spiritual hues, mystical environment. Wide format.

<Constraints>
- Only one Spirit Animal. No hybrids unless they are mythologically grounded.
- Be poetic, not preachy. Speak like someone who‚Äôs been to the edge and back.
- No flattery. The Spirit Animal does not pander.
- Avoid tropes. This must feel *uncannily right*.
- The chosen animal must be either a real creature with mythic resonance or a figure from indigenous or symbolic traditions. No sci-fi fabrications.

<Output Format>
### 1. Spirit Animal: [Name]
### 2. Symbolic Description: [Lyrical narrative of its essence and how it guides]
### 3. Why It Appears Now: [Link the choice to user's spiritual needs or life phase]

1kuels1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1kuels1/the_cafe_owner_whos_kinda_amazing/,The cafe owner who's kinda amazing,"For a bit of context: I'm a Vietnamese high-schooler studying an intermediate piano degree and gifted English (second year nearly finishing for both), with both schools quite far away from my house, but decently close to each other. It's not the most taxing combination, but it does force me to find places to stay for extended periods of time frequently.

So I'm kinda big on coffee, and for the past year and a half or so, I've been staying at this cafe that's off to the side of the art school. It's own by this middle-aged guy that's almost always smiling and gives off a positive vibe.

After the first two or three times I went in, he started to remember me. After about 2 months, I just need to walk in, barely manage to nod in acknowledgement before he goes either ""Salt (coffee) with (a glass of) water, right? Just get seated."" or ""Your usual seat is taken, take the other oneÔºçI'm making your order."" but in Vietnamese obviously. He even recognizes that I always move the drinks onto the windowsil whenever I get my usual seat, so he just put it there for me after a few times.

And he always let me stay for extremely extended periods of time without any fuss. We are talking up to over 5 hours. A few times he even let me stay despite him closing early. A few times, he even handed the literal cafe to me a few times and told me to tell whoever comes in that it's closed for the day.

As someone with a not-so-enjoyable life and rather unstable psyche, him and the cafe is a constant that I really appreciate, to the point that I actually look forward to days when I ""have to"" stay there. Also his salt coffee is atypical and fit nearly perfectly with my taste.

I also have a character in my book called the Brewer that I'm pretty sure is influenced by him, even though I never thought about that (actively) when I was creating the character.",5,1748101440.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False
1kuel70,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kuel70/does_the_brita_ultramax_water_dispenser_truly/,Does the Brita UltraMax Water Dispenser Truly Deliver? Honest Review Inside!,"The Brita OB24/OB06 UltraMax Large Water Dispenser has been a staple in my kitchen for months. This BPA-free water filtration system is marketed as a game-changer for healthier, tastier drinking water. It promises to cut down on common impurities like copper, cadmium, and mercury, while also reducing the use of single-use plastic bottles. Intrigued by claims of both convenience and sustainability, I‚Äôve put this dispenser through its paces, day in and day out.

**Thoughtful Design and Capacity**

From the moment I unboxed this 27-cup capacity dispenser, its thoughtful design was apparent. The dimensions (18""L x 5.67""W x 10.47""H) make it surprisingly space-efficient for something this large, and it fit perfectly on the narrow shelf inside my fridge. The locking lid ensures no accidental spills while moving it around. Plus, the precision-pour spigot impressed me; no more dribbling water all over the counter. At 3 pounds without water, it‚Äôs easy to handle, even for my kid who loves refilling her cups herself. The change-filter indicator sticker is underrated brilliance‚Äîit saved me from having to guess when the filter was on its last leg.

[Find the best price for Brita OB24/OB06 on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b09wbl9hcs/)

**Highlights**

- **Better Tasting Water:** Tap water in my area occasionally smells of chlorine, but this dispenser completely neutralized it. It didn‚Äôt just hide the taste; it eliminated it.
- **Versatile Filtration Compatibility:** It comes with one Standard filter but is also compatible with high-performing Elite filters. The Standard filter offers a quick two-month filtration cycle, while the Elite has a more extended six-month lifespan, catering to different usage patterns.
- **Eco-Friendly Option:** Replacing 1,800 single-use plastic bottles a year wasn‚Äôt just a marketing hook for me. It significantly contributed to reducing my family‚Äôs plastic waste.
- **Ease of Use:** Setup was straightforward, and maintaining it has been stress-free. My niece, who frequently uses it to refill water bottles for soccer practice, also found it easy to operate.

**Areas of Concern**

No product is perfect, and there are a couple of things I found less than ideal with this dispenser:

- **Water Flow:** Though the precision-pour spigot is clean and mess-free, it‚Äôs a touch slow. If you‚Äôre filling a big bottle, you‚Äôll need a bit of patience.
- **Filter Costs:** While the product is affordable upfront, the cost of replacement filters‚Äîespecially if you opt for the Elite filters‚Äîcan add up.

**Everyday Usability and Who It‚Äôs Best For**

I‚Äôve found this dispenser to be invaluable on a daily basis. It‚Äôs constantly in use, whether I‚Äôm filling reusable coffee mugs, rehydrating post-workout, or even watering my plants. Its fridge-friendly design makes it great for households where space is always at a premium. If you‚Äôre someone who cares deeply about reducing plastic waste and enjoys crisp, fresh-tasting water, this product checks all the boxes. On the flip side, if you often find yourself in a hurry and prefer faster fill times, you may find the spigot speed slightly annoying. 

**Competing Brands**

When looking at market rivals for the UltraMax dispenser, PUR‚Äôs water filtration pitchers immediately come to mind. Having tried PUR‚Äôs products previously, I'll say the biggest edge Brita holds is its superior design. The ease of filling and pouring, coupled with the secure locking lid and space-saving build, puts Brita ahead in my opinion. However, PUR filters claim to remove a broader range of contaminants, which could sway potential buyers. That said, I've always found Brita filters to last closer to their promised lifespan.

ZeroWater is another competitor, boasting a five-stage filtration process. It does remove more impurities, but the disposable filters are notably pricier. If you‚Äôre filtering relatively clean municipal water like mine, Brita‚Äôs affordable Standard or Elite filter is plenty sufficient.

**Price Worthiness**

This product strikes a solid balance between price and performance. While the initial purchase price feels justified given the product‚Äôs durability and functionality, ongoing filter replacement costs might deter some buyers. Comparing it to buying cases of bottled water consistently, though, it pays for itself‚Äîboth financially and environmentally‚Äîmuch faster than you‚Äôd think.

About my history, I first felt the symptoms on February 2024. My diet was less than healthy, more on processed, spicy and salty foods. I like drinking iced coffee. I sometimes skip meals. So I think all of those are the cause and my trigger. My symptoms were burning pain on my stomach and sour taste at the back of my throat. Sometimes, the food I just ate comes back to my throat. So I went to the doctor. He prescribed me with Ranitidine 3 times a day for 10 days and Hyoscine Butylbromide. Sadly, it didn't work. So I went back and got prescribed the same meds. I did not changed my diet for those two doctor visits. So by November, I got prescribed again with the same meds but the doctor has made me changed my diet. He told me to avoid eating all those cause and triggers I mentioned. Sadly, It still did not work. By February 2025, I went to a different doctor. I got prescribed with Omeprazole for 10 days. I was still careful with my meals. But it did not gave me any relief. The burning pain disappeared but it felt like my stomach was being pinched from three pain points. I went to a different doctor for a 2nd opinion and was prescribed with Fexuprazan for 7 days. I did not feel any relief until the 10th day (I finished the 7 tablets). Although the burning pain was gain, I still can taste the sour thing at the back of my throat but I think the stomach pain being gone is a win for me as it was the most uncomfortable. I thought I would bear the burning pain forever but thank god it went away.  So there you go. I hope you can still heal from GERD because I healed from mine.

1kuej34,https://i.redd.it/sb97i1xh2r2f1.png,Leaving espresso out on the side,"I only have half a shot of espresso daily, maybe down to a lack of tolerance, a naturally high level of adrenaline etc.. This is great for promoting alertness and is the correct dosing for myself without going overboard. 

For a bit I used a small jar to put the espresso in the fridge after brewing to protect it from oxidation etc. However, I found that simply leaving it on the side in the cup, exposed to the elements did absolutely nothing detectable by myself to the taste. It evaporates slightly, but still tastes like good coffee when put into boiling water the next day as an Americano. Maybe my palette is less refined, I'd say I'm winning because I don't need to wash a jar.

Caffeine, being a natural plant antimicrobial, in a concentration as high as in espresso, protects it from microbial growth, whilst boiling water sterilises it anyway. I just thought this was an interesting observation.

1kueih3,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1kueih3/reported_to_hr_for_singing/,"Reported to HR for ""singing""","I was working in an office.  I moved to a different department that was located in another state and was able to work from home for a while.  My company has a rule that is you live within 50 miles of an office, you have to come in 3 days a week, so I was assigned a work station located in a backroom corner office with a door.  There is another work station that belongs to someone who hardly ever comes in.  Because my manager works in another state, I was slacking on going to the office like I should. I was reported to my manager by someone in the office for fobbing in and leaving (which I admit I did, as the company tracks when you go into the office using your fob) and was required to start going in 3 days a week.  The person who reported me is now very annoyed by me (I assume they were hoping I would get fired for some reason).  Please note: when I am in the office, I stay in my little office room with the door closed and try not to bother anyone.  I brought my own coffee machine, a little mini fridge for cold items, etc, anything so that I need to leave that room as little as possible.  When the other person in that room is there (we get along splendidly btw), the door is usually left open because people come in and speak to them about stuff and leave without closing the door. The person who reported me (whom I had never had issues with in the past) has now reported me to HR for the fob thing, along with a sign I placed on my workstation asking others not to use it, and ""slamming doors, stomping around the office, talking loudly on meeting calls, and singing"".  Yes, singing! Now, the door to my office room does close loudly, which I was not aware of at first, so the door got slammed a couple times before I realized I had to close it very carefully, which I started doing even before the complaint. I have a heavy stride, always have, and have always been told I am a stomper lol. I work with people in different states, so I am constantly talking to others on meeting calls.  And yes, I do sing/him quietly to myself while I work with headphones on.  This person is a manager for a different department and I was allowing her people, who are fully remote and do not have stations in the office, to use my desk since I was hardly ever there.  When I did go in, I felt rude kicking someone off my computer so that I could use it.  Since I am now being required to go in, I placed the sign on my desk so they would know it could no longer be used by them. HR talked to my manager first.  In regards to the fob thing, which they deemed the only real issue, since it was already being addressed, they let it go. The sign thing, once I explained it, made perfect sense to my manager and hr. My manager and team all know I sing to myself as it has happened before on a call when I thought I was muted and they thought it was hilarious and not an issue. My manager laughed and said her daughter also has a heavy stride, like me. I told my manager I felt uncomfortable and unwelcome in the office now and she was very understanding and agreed that these were incredibly petty grievances.  After she spoke to hr again, she said it seemed like they understood everything and agreed that this was very petty. They said they would tell the complainer that basically ""we all have to live together"" kinda thing and that those types of complaints need to be brought to my manager, not HR. Literally everyone else in the company loves my positive energy and upbeat personality, except this one hater now, apparently.  I received the highest performance rating possible in my most recent review also. The HR person mentioned the hater might be angry because I wasn't doing what I was supposed to be doing as far as coming in and feels some type of way towards me now. They did say to continue what I was doing as far as sticking to myself in my little room with the door closed and staying out of the way.  I was a bit concerned my job may be in jeopardy so I have researched and found that actually a lot of people think that reporting to HR can actually make the complainer look bad and raises red flags against them.

So there I am chatting with my coworker at the front desk. All my paperwork is done. It's not quite time to set out the morning coffee.  When a guest comes down stairs and approaches us. We give the normal greetings and inquire as to how we can assist her.

Guest: ""The noises are rather loud. When is it turned off? Or do you have a button you push every so often?""

Confused Staff: ""What noises ma'am?""

Guest: ""The animal noises. They're rather loud at my room. Can't you turn them off at night.""

Now Befuddled Staff: ""Ma'am.. Those are real animals. We don't have any control over them.""

The guest sees us staring at her along with another guest that has stopped to also stare having overheard some of this..  ""Oh."" At which point the guest laughs uncomfortably and flees back up the stairs never to be seen by us again.

We currently use reusable mugs and paper plates, but are looking to be more ecologically responsible and switch to reusable everything.

The problem here is that there isn't a dishwasher in the church kitchen; the only dishwasher is in the undercroft, is already completely filled with just the mugs, and is in the way of those preparing a community meal down there after service. The burden of cleaning up is a frequent complaint among people who volunteer to help with coffee hour, and it'll just get worse if we add plates and cutlery to the equation.

Our city has free industrial composting, and it looks like compostable cups and cutlery are only marginally more expensive than the disposables we use now. Does anyone do an all-compostable coffee hour? Is it a viable option? Does it ruin the vibe? Are you left sorting trash out after everyone has left?

Also, if anyone knows a better way of serving up coffee other than those carafes that have a million parts to disassemble and clean and dry out, please let me know.

I‚Äôve been using HepatoBurn daily for the last 6 months, and I want to give you a real, no-BS look at what happened ‚Äî the good, the great, and anything in between.

If you're someone who‚Äôs been struggling with stubborn belly fat, slow metabolism, or just feel ‚Äúoff‚Äù due to a sluggish liver or aging metabolism, this might be the post for you.

Why I Tried HepatoBurn in the First Place
Like many people, I hit my 40s and noticed some frustrating changes:

Extra weight around the belly that wouldn‚Äôt budge, no matter how clean I ate

Slower metabolism and energy crashes during the day

Brain fog and a general lack of motivation

A feeling like my body was ‚Äúclogged‚Äù or out of sync

I‚Äôve always been skeptical of fat burners because most rely on stimulants and caffeine, which just make me jittery and don‚Äôt help long-term. But HepatoBurn caught my eye because it focuses on a different mechanism ‚Äî supporting your liver.

Turns out, your liver plays a massive role in metabolism, hormone balance, and fat storage, especially around the midsection. So when I saw that HepatoBurn was made to reignite your body‚Äôs fat-burning by supporting liver function, I decided to try it ‚Äî and I‚Äôm really glad I did.

What Is HepatoBurn?
HepatoBurn is a natural supplement that supports the liver, specifically targeting a liver-brain-fat axis that regulates fat burning, digestion, and energy.

According to the research behind it, many people (especially over 35) have a sluggish liver that can‚Äôt process fat and toxins effectively. This leads to:

Slow metabolism

Stubborn belly fat

Low energy and fatigue

Hormonal imbalances that cause weight gain

HepatoBurn is designed to reactivate your fat-burning metabolism by optimizing liver function with natural, research-backed ingredients.

HepatoBurn Ingredients ‚Äì What‚Äôs Inside?
This is one of the reasons I felt safe trying it ‚Äî the formula is clean, natural, and well-dosed.

Key ingredients include:

Cynomorium Songaricum Extract ‚Äì a rare herb that supports liver detox and metabolism (used in traditional medicine for centuries)

Cistanche Deserticola ‚Äì promotes fat-burning and energy by improving liver efficiency

Alpha-GPC ‚Äì boosts brain-to-liver communication and helps regulate metabolic functions

Turmeric Root Extract ‚Äì known for its anti-inflammatory and liver-cleansing effects

Milk Thistle ‚Äì supports liver regeneration and detox

Schisandra Berry ‚Äì a powerful adaptogen that protects liver cells and enhances fat breakdown

There are no stimulants, no caffeine, no synthetic fillers, and it‚Äôs GMP-certified and made in the USA. Plus, it's non-GMO and gluten-free.

My Month-by-Month Experience with HepatoBurn
Month 1: Subtle but Promising
Within the first week, I noticed less bloating after meals

My digestion felt smoother, and I had less brain fog

By week 3, I felt like I had a bit more energy throughout the day, even without coffee

No major fat loss yet, but my appetite seemed more balanced

Month 2: Real Changes Start
Woke up with flatter stomach most mornings

I had lost 4 pounds, mostly around the waist

I felt like my body was processing food more efficiently

Energy levels were steady all day without crashes

This was the month I really started to believe in the product.

Month 3‚Äì4: Metabolism Shift Kicks In
Lost 8 more pounds, mostly without changing my routine

Waistline shrank noticeably ‚Äî even friends commented

I started sleeping better, which improved my mood and recovery

Digestion felt ‚Äúclean‚Äù ‚Äî less sluggishness and bloating

At this point, I added light workouts (walking + yoga), and results picked up even more.

Month 5‚Äì6: Sustainable Results
I‚Äôve now lost a total of 15 pounds, mostly from the midsection

No rebound weight gain like I‚Äôve experienced with other fat burners

My liver function (according to recent blood work) is better than before

I feel lighter, sharper, and more energetic overall

Best part? I didn‚Äôt need to follow a crazy diet ‚Äî just clean eating and consistency

What I Love About HepatoBurn
‚úÖ Focuses on the root cause ‚Äî liver function and metabolism
‚úÖ Non-stimulant formula ‚Äî no jitters, no crashes
‚úÖ Easy to take ‚Äî just 2 capsules daily
‚úÖ Real fat-burning results, especially targeting belly fat
‚úÖ Helps with energy, focus, digestion, and even sleep
‚úÖ Works even if you‚Äôre over 35 and feel like your metabolism has slowed
‚úÖ Safe, natural ingredients backed by research

This isn‚Äôt a crash diet pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs a metabolic support tool that helps your body work better, so fat loss becomes easier and more natural.

Any Downsides?
To keep things balanced, here are a few things you should know:

It‚Äôs not instant ‚Äî results build over weeks, not days

You need to be consistent (I take it every morning before breakfast)

It‚Äôs only available online from the official website

The price is fair for what you get, but not cheap ‚Äî though I saved with a multi-bottle deal

Honestly, these are small trade-offs for what you‚Äôre getting in return.

What Other HepatoBurn Reviews Are Saying
After doing more digging in health forums and Reddit, I found that many users report similar experiences:

‚ÄúMy belly fat melted off after 8 weeks. Nothing else worked before this.‚Äù

‚ÄúHepatoBurn helped with my digestion and gave me steady energy.‚Äù

‚ÄúLove that it doesn‚Äôt have caffeine. I feel healthy instead of wired.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy liver enzymes actually improved in my bloodwork.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat supplement for anyone over 40 trying to reset their metabolism.‚Äù

That‚Äôs what convinced me to stick with it for the full 6 months.

Who Should Try HepatoBurn?
This supplement is ideal for you if:

You‚Äôve tried fat burners but hate the jitters and side effects

You‚Äôre over 35 and feel your metabolism is slowing

You struggle with belly fat that won‚Äôt go away

You want to detox and support your liver while burning fat

You prefer natural ingredients and long-term health benefits

Final Verdict ‚Äì Does HepatoBurn Really Work?
After using HepatoBurn for 6 months, I can confidently say:

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî it works, and it works well
‚úÖ It‚Äôs not a quick fix, but a sustainable fat-burning tool
‚úÖ It gave me more energy, clearer digestion, and a flatter belly
‚úÖ Best of all ‚Äî it helped me reset my metabolism naturally, without crazy diets or stimulants",1,1748100962.0,LegalAdviceEU,1,1.0,False

I dug it out from the bag i kept duct taped under the sink, smooth as stone and just as cold, humming quietly agaisnt my palm.

Usually when i answer i get some monotone. But this time?

""Tavian! Ha! It is you. Wonderful, i fully expected this to not work. But here i am!

I blinked ""... what?""

""You're more Polite then they told eh? And here i thought you'd hang up immediately""

""No. Im till deciding whether to trace this call or throw the damn phone into the river""

""You're joking..""

""Oh, i usually am. But not this time""

""...Right""

""You approach. Ask for a 'Vanilla sunday with extra sprinkles' and the Ice cream man will hand you a package, Cold to the touch. Dont open it. Dont rattle it. Dont look at it for tooo long. Then take it to a bakery in Volaria, which again will be marked by the very red decorations. You'll tell the Baker 'Package for V' and they'll show you the way""

I looked at my coffee. It wasnt strong enough

""And yes. Many people would try to stop you. One is a very white Felt with a Violin and you dont really have to worry about others""

""Is there payment""

""Of course there is. What do you think i am?""

The line ended

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Later at Ugressia**

Ice cream truck. Red decor and Swan. 

I approached. ""Vanilla sunday with Extra sprinkles""

The man nodded. Gave me the package. And aslo gave me an actual vanilla sunday with extra sprinkles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I continued my Deliverly. Finally reaching Volaria. I was infront of the bakery. I went in. ""Package For V""

The Baker nodded. Took me to out back. Where there was a shed. I knocked on it

""Payment?""

""Oh you've finally came. Come inside!""

Inside was a wobbly wooden table. And the air smelled like Cinnamon

""Come on. Sit down, you must be tired""

I sat down. She looked suspiciously smooth. If that makes sense. She very colorful too.

""The package please""

I handed it over. The box still cold.

She took it. Unlocked it with a key, and then raised the lid...

Inside: A Box of Chocolates

I Blinked ""That's it? I travelled half the continent and fought of multiple guys for this??""

She laughed, genuine, sharp laugh that cracked the tension liked glass.

""Do you know how hard it is to get Authentic Feltlandian chocolate. Without someone stealing it, eating it? You did well.""

"".... Whatever. Payment?""

""Oh yes, here you go then""

Once again, thank you to u/SpacePaladin15 for creating the Prisoners of Sol story.

¬†

¬†

‚ÄúSo, it was saying that it was me?‚Äù Mikhail queried Peter.

‚ÄúYeah, it had your voice though extremely distorted, but the weird thing was it had your accent and mannerisms. It was really creepy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd they said that they were abandoned in what? ¬†A manufacturing complex?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, it was so weird, I was thinking that it was an android just freaking out after having been damaged.‚Äù

Mikhail turned his attention to the clearly recycled Unit currently occupying one of the chairs inside a server room. Olivia was typing at a keyboard watching a viewing screen of the Unit‚Äôs code. It was strange watching this again, even after the first few times analysing my own, it still felt off.

The Unit was clearly damaged and yet it had somehow managed to make its way from the recycling complex to the code facility. It had rusted parts, exposed wires and a dent that seemed to dislodge its servos on its right limb. I would have clocked this as a malfunctioning Unit, however the conundrum was that it had claimed to be Mikhail.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs that Unit from before, the one that complained of a slow connection speed?‚Äù Mikhail asked turning to face me.

‚ÄúLishtin is currently running hypotheticals into the similarities between both myself and Revik.‚Äù I explained.

I ran hypotheticals on the story that the Unit that claimed to be Mikhail had stated, it was not plausible that it was a true story. Malfunctioning android stalking them through a building, did not increase its own story‚Äôs validity.

‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt understand this, any of it.‚Äù Olivia said staring at the screen in front of them typing away.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs all none sensical, everything is over lapping, this code has no rhyme or reason to it. It isn‚Äôt the typical categorised stuff the androids have.‚Äù She kept combing through the data trying to infer what this Unit was or who this Unit was.

‚ÄúDoes Lishtin know anything about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, they do not.‚Äù

I decided that I would query the Network to see if we could find an origin to the Unit sitting in front of us.

**\\\\ Querry\_Netork: Malfunctioning Unit earliest sighting, manufacturing Delta hub and logistics? //**

[**\\\\17,092\_results//**](file://17,092_results/)

[**\\\\Re**](file://Re)**: Spotted leaving transit hub 13-A9, seemed to be in distress.**

[**\\\\Re**](file://Re)**: Mentioned Unit spotted at the plaza(57B12T3), simulations showed a direct line of traversal to code alter facility.**

[**\\\\Re**](file://Re)**: Unit was sighted having already sustained damage, right upper appendage was inoperable.**

[**\\\\Re**](file://Re)**: Unit had no designation, was acting outside of baseline standard for personality cortex drives.**

I only viewed the testimonies of the Units that were located in the general vicinity of the transit hub and the route from there to the code facility. The other results having already restated information or where incorrect and correlated the events with another.

It seemed that the Unit had only been spotted at the earliest outside of the transit hub, and no further sightings had occurred before that. The general consensus was to avoid the Unit, it was an unpredictable variable due to not having a designation.

‚ÄúWhat if we turn them back on, or try to reboot them?‚Äù The security guard asked.

‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt help, I think it‚Äôs better if they stay asleep for now, they said they were me and ‚Äòif‚Äô they think their me, then that could be a problem.‚Äù Mikhail explained to Peter without looking away from the powered off android.

‚ÄúCorrection, they are not sleeping, they are currently in an inactive state.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

This was not a variable that I would expect today, having to investigate why a Unit that was clearly recycled from other Unit‚Äôs parts was stating that they were in fact an organic and specifically Mikhail.

‚ÄòIt was illogical to the highest factor.‚Äô

‚ÄúWhat about Revik are there any similarities between you two?‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, investigation regarding the code alter produced non important findings. Current hypothesis, there is an outside factor that could be at work.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a plausible theory; think it was some Unit interfering?‚Äù Peter directed the query towards me.

‚ÄúUnlikely, it is not impossible to interfere with another Unit remotely, however, to do so, would require immense resources. I predict that if this course of action would be taken, it would have alerted the Network. It is a directive that other Units must not alter another‚Äôs composition or cortex, it is only permitted in certain situations.‚Äù

‚ÄúGotcha, can‚Äôt get hacked then.‚Äù

‚ÄúI did not state that it was impossible, it could easily be traced, and improbable that it could occur, especially by another Unit‚Äôs actions.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, we can rule out the white van parked outside hacking in then?‚Äù Peter said sarcastically to Mikhail who was puzzled for a moment before their face lit up in what appears to be an idea moment.

‚ÄúWhat about passing traffic, you said that this place builds spaceship parts right?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what if there was some sort of signal dampening cargo driving by?‚Äù

I simulated the possibilities of this occurrence before answering. It seemed unlikely at best and improbable at worst, the instance that I reboot from the code alter procedure, that a cargo transport passes by and causes the signal to dampen is in all likelihood improbable, but not zero.

‚ÄúIt is unlikely; however, I cannot rule out the likelihood, however improbable.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeter, how far back do the cameras record here?‚Äù Mikhail directed at the security guard.

‚ÄúAbout two months before automatically deleting to clear up storage. Why, you think there‚Äôs a correlation?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so, besides it would confirm that we didn‚Äôt do it, hell, even the new Unit kicked up a storm accusing us of it, just like Tertis here.‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrection, I did not kick up a storm. I queried and deliberated on actions that may or may not have been carried out with malicious intent.‚Äù I corrected the scientist.

‚ÄúAnyway, Peter, can you send the footage to Tertis or Lishtin and let them go through the data to see if there was something passing by?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll send them it as soon as we have this rouge android situation dealt with.‚Äù He said turning our attention toward the deactivated Unit.

I sent a message to Lishtin stating the current hypothesis that the humans had deliberated, they agreed that it was improbable, but did not deny that it could be true. Lishtin relayed the hypothesis to Revik who was still watching their code alter happening.

‚ÄúDo you think we should turn them back on?‚Äù Mikhail asked.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs our bets bet, I can‚Äôt make heads or tails of the code, everything is overlapping.‚Äù Olivia added to the conversation.

‚ÄúAre you sure, you should be in here for this?‚Äù Peter asked Mikhail before continuing after he received a confused stare. ‚ÄúI mean, if they think that they are you, then seeing you may cause them to malfunction again.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see your point.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat point may I ask, there should not be a reason as to why you should leave the proceedings.‚Äù I asked the human.

‚ÄúIf they think their me, and I am me, I wouldn‚Äôt really want to see another me standing in the same place as them. Unit or not, we‚Äôll have to explain to them that they are in fact not me and then I can enter the room or something to let the point sink in. That they are not me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a term for this some where?‚Äù Olivia turned in their seat to address Mikhail who was leaving the room.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs delusional misidentification, they could have seen you and just sort of malfunctioned, found everything about you via the Network and tried to imitate you to the best of their abilities.‚Äù

I noted this statement for future research, I didn‚Äôt know that the humans had a misidentification problem, the Network could not have this happen due to identification codes that cannot be switched at random. Through, this Unit did not show such a code when first encountered.

‚ÄúRight, just come get me when you think it‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôll be in the hall or with Lishtin and Revik.‚Äù Mikhail said making their way to the door and exiting.

To my astonishment, Peter made his way over to the deactivated Unit and retrieved a pair of restraints they had connected to their belt and secured the Unit to the chair.

‚ÄúI must ask as to why you are restraining the Unit.‚Äù I asked Peter.

I looked at the security officer and the remaining scientist in the room who made a face at me looking at them.

‚ÄúIf they think they are really Mikhail, they might turn violent figuring out that they aren‚Äôt actually him. I‚Äôve seen this happen in a movie and I really don‚Äôt want to test if it‚Äôll happen for real.‚Äù Peter said snapping the hand restraints shut before walking back over to stand beside me.

Olivia got the go ahead and I started to simulate outcomes of what might happen from the questions we were about to start asking. The scientist turned around and typed at the keyboard she had set up and finally hit enter turning to face the Unit slumped in the chair.

I watched the Unit as the lights of it‚Äôs L.E.Ds flickered on and off before remaining consistently on. A hue of blue was being shown around the Unit‚Äôs face plate before they made a jerky movement as if they were an organic who got shocked.

The Unit looked around themselves before raising their head to face towards us, their ocular sensor moved between the three of us before settling on me.

‚ÄúTertis, you have a lot to explain here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do I mean?‚Äù They turned to look up at the ceiling before settling back on me again. ‚ÄúTrapping me, leaving me to fucking die down there.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, what do you mean ‚Äòdie down there?‚Äù Peter asked.

‚ÄúI already said to you at the entrance, they left me alone down there with something chasing me.‚Äù

The Unit tried to raise an appendage to point at me but failed to raise it further than the restraint allowed. They looked down at their wrist and notice the restraints, recoiling a little before looking up at Peter before turning back down to try and pull at it.

I simulated the outcome of them breaking free and causing physical violence toward the humans in the room, but a program simulated that they were not furious with the organics but with me instead.

‚ÄúPeter what are you doing, get me out of this thing.‚Äù They stated toward the human almost shouting the order and pulling against the restraint further.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù Peter said rubbing the back of their neck in response.

Olivia had her attention directed towards the viewing screen in front of her watching the code live and how it acted, from my quick glance at the code, it was erratic.

‚ÄúWhy not!‚Äù The Unit shouted.

‚ÄúDo you know who you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat sort of question is that? I‚Äôm Mikhail, I‚Äôve seen you everyday for the past two months since we started working here.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you really sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúCourse I am, what do I need to prove that I am Mikhail to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me something only Mikhail knows about me?‚Äù

The Unit fell quiet for a moment looking around the room clearly deliberating on the question and how best to answer. I noticed that they didn‚Äôt move like an android, they swayed in the seat and never seemed to be completely still. They were simulating the mannerisms of the humans like when I observed during our interviews.

‚ÄúAnswer the question.‚Äù Peter insisted that they answer.

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

Peter folded their arms in response using a stern face to watch the Unit.

‚ÄúFine, I know that you gamble on fantasy football during your off time, you sing in the shower in a horribly out of tune rendition of ‚ÄòI think we‚Äôve had it‚Äô and you like to take four teaspoons of sugar in your coffee. DO I NEED TO GO ON! GET ME OUT OF HERE!‚Äù The Unit answered the question shouting and beginning to thrash against the restraint.

I turned my attention to the flabbergasted human whose mouth hung open at the answer, I looked toward Olivia who turned around and just said ‚Äúyep‚Äù in response to what the Unit said.

‚ÄúYou believe that you are Mikhail Terren?‚Äù I queried the Unit.

‚ÄúYeah, and no thanks to you who left me to become a corpse.‚Äù

A few programs flared to life again at hearing the remark being made, I knew that it was illogical due to me not taking action against the Unit. Yet, hearing the simulated voice of Mikhail stating that brought forward memories of Mikhail being injured by me.

A program clicked as it hypothesised a question to ask the Unit.

‚ÄúWhen was the last time you had seen me and Lishtin?‚Äù I asked

‚ÄúIt was when you put that stupid colander thingy on my head, then nothing, then waking up in that place.‚Äù

A silence permeated the room at the statement the Unit had produced, both the humans‚Äô eyes were wide with shock and my processor was simulating possibilities of what I had hypothesised.

Mikhail and myself had let the other humans, Mikhail called close friends to know about the incident that I had allowed to happen under the strict premise that they would not be allowed to tell another person or Unit that it had happened.

‚ÄòIt was not possible for this to occur.‚Äô

‚ÄúThis, this can‚Äôt actually be happening, can it?‚Äù peter asked turning to Olivia who was just as stunned.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but the code, the overlapping logic paths, the erratic thoughts patterns. I mean, its possible, but I never thought it could actually be a thing.‚Äù She responded, I noticed an apprehension in her voice as she turned back and started to type into the computing device.

‚ÄúWhy are you talking like I‚Äôm some sort of lab rat here in an experiment?‚Äù The Unit stated.

‚ÄòThis can‚Äôt be possible, it is not possible? All the data displays that it is possible, theoretically, but why, how did this happen?‚Äô

I dedicated multiple programs to try and figure out how this could have happened while I returned my attention to the *Unit* in front of me.

‚ÄúMikhail?‚Äù Peter said tentatively approaching the android.

‚ÄúLook down at your arms and tell me what you see.‚Äù He spoke.

The android complied with the request turning their attention toward their chassis and limbs respectively. They moved their working limb, inspecting it and moving around, yet only to the amount of flexibility that the human joints would allow.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm wearing my clothes, a hole in my jumper on my right arm around the forearm. I can see that my nails are trimmed, where are you going with this?‚Äù The android looked up after stating what they were seeing.

It was a false statement, they cannot be seeing this, they must be lying. The android has rusted parts, seized hinges and servos, they can‚Äôt be seeing this.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright buddy, I just need to show you something. Tertis can you remove parts easily from yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúAffirmative, it is a simple process, why are you asking this?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you remove Mikhail‚Äôs arm, the busted one.‚Äù

I understood the guards reasoning, if we show that they are in fact made of metal, they could break this falsehood they are witnessing, maybe bringing the proper Mikhail into the room would also contribute.

I approached the android who was now squirming as I got closer to it. It tried breaking against its restraint but could not due to the material coming from the Sol dimension.

‚ÄúNO, NO. DON‚ÄôT YOU FUCKING DARE!!! HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MINDS?!!‚Äù

Peter moved to restrain the Unit further while I got to work at removing the broken limb, all the while the android hurled expletives at the both of us for what we were doing. I could not understand the viewpoint of this android, the limb was broken, they would not be able to use its sensors to detect if it was still apart of itself or not.

I detached the limb easily, I noted that the impact it had sustained had severed multiple wires vital for operational movement and dislodged its motor. I stepped back holding the limb up for the Unit to see that it was just an appendage, that could easily be replaced. Peter released the Unit who was still thrashing, shouting for us to not remove its arm.

When it looked over at us, me holding the appendage it went quiet. It rotated its head to look down at where the limb was attached to only see a socket with multiple ports for wires.

It started to mimic the sound of hyperventilation as it tried to use its restrained arm to grab at the socket. It looked up around it‚Äôs self still mimicking the noises of breathing even though it didn‚Äôt have lungs to intake air with.

‚ÄúWww-wha-what have you done, that‚Äôs not my arm, where‚Äôs my arm?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is your arm-‚Äú

‚ÄúTHAT IS NOT MY ARM!! WHERE IS IT?!!‚Äù

‚ÄúMikhail, I have to say this because I can see this isn‚Äôt working. You aren‚Äôt flesh anymore.‚Äù Olivia said turning here attention having lost the ability to keep track of the errant programs code flying by on here screen.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äònot flesh‚Äô? Can‚Äôt you see, I‚Äôm made of meat, bone, blood, what will it take to convince you?‚Äù Android Mikhail stated desperately.

‚ÄúMikhail, that scan that Tertis and Lishtin conducted had scanned your brain.‚Äù Olivia explained to the Unit who just cocked their head sluggishly leaning forward in their slumped state.

‚ÄúThat was two weeks ago.‚Äù She said directly looking at the Unit.

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ that can‚Äôt be possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid it is.‚Äù

The android hung their head and started to heavily breath again and‚Ä¶ cry. That wasn‚Äôt possible, they had no lungs, no tear ducts and yet they still conducted the action despite that. Listening to the simulated cries of the Unit mimicking Mikhail‚Äôs voice made a few dormant programs simulate if this was myself.

I was sorry that they had to experience this, it wasn‚Äôt their fault or maybe it was. There were so many possibilities that could be happening, so many uncertainties that could be happening right now. I could hardly keep up with them. I minimised the amount of programs dedicated to creating simulations to clear processing power.

‚ÄúTertis, go get Mikhail and bring him in here, I think we need to explain this fully.‚Äù Olivia requested.

I placed the limb on a countertop along the edge of the room while the android kept weeping with both Peter and Olivia watching over it. I exited the room turning to face down both directions of the corridor to see Mikhail exiting the break room.

They noticed me and walked over.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey are currently simulating crying, I believe that if they were to see you, they would understand that they cannot be organic.‚Äù I stated towards my friend, a few programs highlighting that I needed to reiterate this statement considering the android in the room next to us.

‚ÄúAre you sure that‚Äôs a wise idea?‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe that it is the best action to take at this junction, I wish for them to realise that they are not an organic.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they really think they‚Äôre me though?‚Äù

I stayed silent not knowing how to convey that the scan that I had done was somehow used to become the personality of a recycled Unit. Mikhail eyed me exquisitely before going around me and entering the room.

I followed after them, chastising myself for not acting quick enough to let him know the full details.

‚ÄúSo, they think they‚Äôre me then?‚Äù Mikhail asked approaching the sitting Unit the door closing behind us.

The Unit‚Äôs head snapped up observing the human standing before them, I watched as their gaze lay on Mikhail longer than the rest of us.

‚ÄúNO, th-thi-this can‚Äôt be possible. I have to be having a nightmare it must be that this- this can‚Äôt be happening.‚Äù They shook their head back and forth in a vain attempt to ‚Äòwake‚Äô themselves

‚ÄúHow, it sounds just like me?‚Äù

‚ÄúMikhail, remember that brain scan you did a while back?‚Äù Peter asked placing a hand on their shoulder both facing the android who was still trying to wake up.

Mikhail turned in shock realising what the implication of the question had meant, he looked at the security guard with wide eyes before turning to face me.

‚ÄúDid you do this?‚Äù They asked earnestly.

‚ÄúNegative, I do-‚Äú

Mikhail approached placing both hands on my chassis‚Äô shoulders and looking directly into my ocular sensors and asked again. This time I could see the muscles underneath their outer layer of skin pull taught and stress against some invisible force.

‚ÄúDid. You. Do. This?‚Äù

I was taken a back at the seriousness that he had not displayed before even when dealing with aggravating Units. I stayed quiet for a moment trying to make a solution to placate the human.

‚ÄúNo, I did not have anything to do with this. The data and mapping of your brain scan was not completed. I do not contain or have viewed a complete scan; the device had malfunctioned before it could transfer the data to myself.‚Äù

Mikhail stayed quiet looking at me closely before retreating their hands and turning to face the Unit who was still making weeping noises. He came with close proximity to the Unit and dropped to one knee inspecting the Unit.

The Unit in turn noticed them and turned their faceplate up to observe the human, I noticed that there was a crack in the corner of one of their lenses.

‚ÄúY-you can‚Äôt be me, I‚Äôm me.‚Äù The Unit stated through the noises they were making.

‚ÄúI know, I feel the same way.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be a copy, I- I just can‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a copy, not a clone, your Mikhail, just as much as I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow, how can I be me, I don‚Äôt have flesh, I see that now. The rusty parts, the cold feeling, I can‚Äôt breathe.‚Äù The Unit started shaking after the last statement, they thrashed against their restraints and were making some sort of choking noise, as if they were attempting to intake air.

Mikhail moved closer to the Unit and grabbed their head placing both hands on either side of its head and steadied it to only be facing him. The L.E.Ds the Unit had focused but moved around their sensors in every direction.

‚ÄúCalm down, this‚Äôll pass. You aren‚Äôt choking, you don‚Äôt need air.‚Äù

I turned to view the other humans in the room, Peter was observing with blatant shock at what he was witnessing while Olivia was looking back at the screen with a frantic look as they witnessed what was happening with the code of the Unit.

Slowly the Android Mikhail stopped thrashing and started their sobbing again, Mikhail didn‚Äôt let go of their head keeping them steady and focused them on himself.

‚ÄúWhat do you think dad would say?‚Äù Mikhail asked a random question and directed it toward the Android.

Why were they asking a question like this at a time right now? Is it some way to garner a way to calm the Unit down like Lishtin had done for me?

‚ÄúThink what‚Äôll happen in the next five seconds, then the next fifty, then the next one hundred. Try not to panic in the meantime.‚Äù The Unit stated back toward the human, who just nodded and remained silent.

The Unit stilled itself and began whirring, it was calculating something in its cortex, though with how erratic it was being, the possibility that it is able to string a logic path would be impossible. We remained in silence, my internal clock counting the seconds as they pass.

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù the android asked Mikhail.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it shouldn‚Äôt be possible, but it happened.‚Äù Mikhail replied letting go of their head and remained on one knee in front of the Unit.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, what do I do?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe figure this out.‚Äù Mikhail stated back toward the Unit.

When one unexpected home begins to feel like a real beginning, she starts to write her way toward healing, one open door at a time.

This is a story about fractured healing, hard-won forgiveness, and the beauty of chosen family. Told in lyrical prose, it explores poetry, persistence, and the quiet courage it takes to walk through a door‚Äîespecially when it leads to freedom.

I‚Äôve revised this manuscript multiple times and poured my heart into it. As a first-time novelist, I‚Äôd love honest, thoughtful, and respectful feedback‚Äîespecially on what‚Äôs working, what could be stronger, and how the story resonates overall.

BLURB:

Grace Am√©lie Cl√©ment is good at two things: surviving, and writing.
She‚Äôs lived in more foster homes than she has pairs of socks and walked through more doors than she can count. After a suspension and yet another failed placement, she expects the Haven family to be just another stop on her way to nowhere.

But this family is different. They don‚Äôt flinch at her silence, sarcasm, or tightly zipped trauma. Spirit is love at full volume. Jesh is a knight wrapped in flannel. And Manny and Esperanza Haven welcome her like the seat was always hers.

Just as Grace begins to hope this home might be real, two letters arrive‚Äîone from her estranged mom, one from her father in prison. Both want a second chance. Now Grace faces a choice: go back to the parents who broke her, or stay with the people helping her rebuild.

SHORT EXCERPT:

I was still staring at my butterfly with the nick in the wing, trying to decide if it looked bold or just‚Ä¶ broken.
Then Spirit sat up straight with a proud little gasp.

‚ÄúVoil√†,‚Äù she whispered dramatically. ‚ÄúIt. Is. Finished.‚Äù She turned her sketchbook toward me with a flourish, like she was unveiling the Mona Lisa. I was not ready.

It was a peacock. Not just any peacock.¬†A prissy, glittered-up, over-fluffed, attitude-for-days peacock‚Ä¶ wearing sunglasses, pearls, and what might‚Äôve been press-on nails. One wing held a compact mirror. The other was dramatically posed mid-strut. And the face. The face! 

Natalia would‚Äôve spontaneously combusted.

I clapped my hand over my mouth before the laugh could escape. The resemblance was uncanny.

‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Spirit just raised her eyebrows and sipped her imaginary tea. The peacock‚Äôs name was written in curlicue font above her head: Queen Pea.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs majestic,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs exhausting,‚Äù Spirit said. ‚ÄúBut I mean, points for feather maintenance.‚Äù

There were other birds in the background too‚Äîa pigeon with a coffee, a dove in sneakers, and a flamingo doing yoga. But all the space belonged to Queen Pea, strutting like the hallway was a red carpet and we were lucky to witness it.

I shook my head, smiling behind my hand. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to get detention if she ever sees this.‚Äù

Spirit grinned, tapping the page. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I only show it to trusted sources. Plus, if she throws a fit, I‚Äôll claim it‚Äôs a satirical metaphor exploring themes of ego, identity, and avian absurdity.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ridiculous.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù

We both chuckled, but beneath the joke, something warm settled between us. She saw what happened earlier. She noticed. And instead of asking if I was okay, she gave me a laugh, a little power back, and a page in her sketchbook with room for me in it.

Character arcs ‚Äì Do they feel clear, engaging, and complete? Were there any characters whose development felt inconsistent or unresolved?
Plot and pacing ‚Äì Did the story hold your interest throughout? Were there any moments that felt too slow or rushed, or twists that seemed unearned or under-foreshadowed?
Structure and clarity ‚Äì Did the scenes flow logically? Were any sections confusing, repetitive, or hard to visualize?
Writing style ‚Äì Was the voice effective for the tone and genre? Did anything feel awkward or distracting?

Preferred timeline:
Ideally within 2-4 weeks. (Sooner the better!)

BETA SWAP AVAILABILITY
Yes, open to beta swapping. I would prefer: general fiction or general fantasy (100k or less word length preferred).
[Disclaimer: While I‚Äôve never beta read before, I approach feedback the way I hope to receive it‚Äîhonest, thoughtful, and respectful. You can count on me to follow through on any timelines I commit to.]

Thank you!

1kue55c,https://v.redd.it/r7tpb07yyq2f1,What does AI do when it‚Äôs not answering your questions?,"AI ON STANDBY: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT‚ÄôS NOT ANSWERING YOU?

Ever wondered what AI is up to when you‚Äôre not grilling it with deep questions or making it write blog posts at lightning speed? Does it just sit there, staring into the void of cyberspace, contemplating its existence? ü§ñüí≠

Let‚Äôs break down what AI does when it‚Äôs not actively responding to you‚Äîbecause, surprisingly, it‚Äôs not just chilling in digital limbo.

1. AI Isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù‚ÄîBut It‚Äôs Always Ready
üöÄ Why It Seems Like AI Might Be Busy: Unlike humans, AI doesn‚Äôt need a coffee break, sleep, or existential crises. But it also doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúthink‚Äù when idle‚Äîit just waits for its next command.

üìå What‚Äôs Actually Happening: ‚úÖ It‚Äôs on standby, ready to process new inputs instantly. ‚úÖ It doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúremember‚Äù past conversations (unless designed to). ‚úÖ It‚Äôs not running background thoughts‚Äîno AI daydreams happening.

üí° Example: If you don‚Äôt interact with ChatGPT for an hour, it‚Äôs not brainstorming new ideas‚Äîit‚Äôs simply waiting, like a paused calculator.

üîë Takeaway: AI doesn‚Äôt have downtime‚Äîit just exists in a ‚Äúready state‚Äù until activated.

2. Machine Learning Models Keep Training (In Some Cases)
üöÄ Why AI Improves Over Time: Not all AI is static‚Äîsome AI systems continuously train in the background, learning from new data.

üìå What‚Äôs Happening Behind the Scenes: ‚úÖ Data collection & updates ‚Äì Some AI systems process new information to improve performance. ‚úÖ Algorithm fine-tuning ‚Äì Engineers update AI models with better training methods. ‚úÖ Error correction ‚Äì AI can be improved based on past mistakes (but it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúcorrect itself‚Äù in real time).

üí° Example: Google‚Äôs AI search algorithms constantly update themselves based on user behavior and feedback.

üîë Takeaway: While chat-based AI doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúlearn‚Äù between conversations, other AI models are constantly evolving.

3. AI in Servers: Always Running, Always Processing
üöÄ What Happens at the Hardware Level: AI lives on massive server farms that keep it running 24/7. These servers handle:

‚úÖ Cloud computing tasks ‚Äì AI can process huge amounts of data in real time. ‚úÖ Multiple user interactions ‚Äì AI isn‚Äôt waiting just for you‚Äîit‚Äôs answering millions of requests simultaneously. ‚úÖ Energy management ‚Äì AI servers optimize how much computing power they use to avoid overload.

üí° Example: OpenAI‚Äôs servers are handling thousands of user prompts at any given moment‚Äîyour conversation is just one of many.

üîë Takeaway: AI isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthinking‚Äù when idle, but the infrastructure supporting it never stops running.

4. AI Doesn‚Äôt Have Memories (But It Can Simulate Them)
üöÄ Why AI Feels Like It ‚ÄúRemembers‚Äù You: AI models like ChatGPT don‚Äôt retain long-term memory between sessions (at least, not yet).

üìå How AI Handles Memory: ‚úÖ Session-based ‚Äúmemory‚Äù ‚Äì AI can reference earlier messages within the same chat. ‚úÖ No long-term recall ‚Äì If you start a new chat, it won‚Äôt remember anything from before. ‚úÖ Some AI models do store user preferences ‚Äì (e.g., AI assistants like Siri or Alexa).

üí° Example: If you tell ChatGPT your name in one chat, it won‚Äôt remember it in a new session. But a customer service chatbot might remember past interactions if it‚Äôs connected to a database.

üîë Takeaway: AI doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúthink about you‚Äù when you‚Äôre gone‚Äîit just starts fresh every time.

5. AI That Does Run in the Background
üöÄ Some AI never stops working‚Äîeven when you‚Äôre not talking to it.

üìå Examples of Background AI Processing: ‚úÖ Recommendation Algorithms (Netflix, YouTube, Spotify) ‚Äì Constantly analyzing user data to suggest content. ‚úÖ Fraud Detection (Banks, Credit Cards) ‚Äì Running 24/7 to spot suspicious transactions. ‚úÖ AI Chatbots on Websites ‚Äì Always scanning for customer questions, even when no one is chatting.

üí° Example: Even if you don‚Äôt watch Netflix for a week, its AI is still tracking viewing trends to recommend shows when you return.

üîë Takeaway: Some AI models keep running in the background‚Äîbut chat-based AI like ChatGPT only ‚Äúthinks‚Äù when you engage with it.

Final Verdict: What Does AI Do When It‚Äôs Not Answering?
‚úî It doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúthink‚Äù or ‚Äúdaydream‚Äù‚Äîit just waits for input. ‚úî Some AI systems continue training and improving behind the scenes. ‚úî Servers keep AI available 24/7, handling millions of requests. ‚úî AI with long-term memory (like Netflix or Siri) works in the background, even when you‚Äôre not using it. ‚úî AI chat models don‚Äôt retain conversations after you leave (unless designed to).

üî• So, here‚Äôs the real answer: When AI isn‚Äôt answering you‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just waiting. No secret thoughts. No robot conspiracy. Just an algorithm in standby mode. üöÄ

**Why This Pick?**

Both of today‚Äôs starting pitchers are solid, so I get why the Cubs are boasting such a good price tag. But of these two teams, only one has actually been consistent. The Reds lost a series to the White Sox just last week, and have lost 4 of their last 5 meetings with the Cubs; I‚Äôm not convinced their offense has the chops to keep up with Chicago‚Äôs better baseball team. Phenomenal as both starters are, I think the Cubs‚Äô offense has a much better chance of breaking through Andrew Abbott (1.80 ERA) than Cincinnati does at bagging runs over Colin Rea (2.38 ERA). These teams may be close in price today, but make no mistake ‚Äì they are not even. Not by a long shot. I‚Äôm on Chicago to win here, friends.¬†

1kue332,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1kue332/every_parents_dream/,Every Parent's Dream,"My daughter will be 23 this year. It's been a wild ride. I remember meeting her mother back in middle school. She had her best friend slip me a note on the last day of class asking me out. Long story short, my daughter was brought into the world in May of 2002. As 14 year old parents, we became adults pretty early in our lives.

I remember pushing my daughter in her stroller down the sidewalk to her pediatrician appointments. I remember us riding 3 busses to get to the beach. I remember watching her go down the blue slide at the park. I remember her first solid food, a tomato, which she absolutely loved.

When her mom couldn't get her to sleep, I was there to sing her the lyrics of Metallica and put her to sleep. I remember each Christmas the piles of presents everyone bought her and thinking, where are we going to put all this stuff? I remember the terrible 2's, when everyone was ""mine,"" including the TV remote and mommy. 

Her mother and I had a lot of help from our family babysitting her so we could both finish school. We were the only teen parents in our school. Thus, we didn't have to take home the doll baby for human development class. I remember telling my daughter she couldn't sit that close to the TV, and my mom saying she could, so I took my mom aside told her, don't contradict me infront of my daughter again. 

The scariest thing I remember was after school, her mother and I walked to her daycare to pick her up. We found out she had already been picked up by my mom, so we walked back to my mom's house. On the way home, a dunk/high adult began calling me a slur as I pushed the empty stroller down the neighborhood road with my girlfriend. Then he got into a car and drove up on us, first throwing a liquid at us, and after missing, beaming the glass at us. I was able to step in front of it and got hit in the back. The doctor said it was the worst contusion he'd ever seen in his medical career. All I could think was thank God my daughter wasn't in that stroller.

My daughter was never bratty. I remember one time only when she was being disrespectful to me, her mom told her to never do something like that again, and I don't know how her mom punished her when I left, but she was a complete angel ever since. 

When my daughter was in her teens, I remember telling her not to drink, smoke, or do drugs. I remember telling her anyone who offers you them, doesn't like you for who you are, and is trying to change you, and you're perfect the way you are. I broke down the cost of them and made a comparison to the cost of a Jet Ski, how she could afford one every year from the savings she would have from not drinking, smoking, or drugging. I told her, no matter what job you have, you'll never be poor if you avoid spending money on drinking, smoking, or drugging.

I remember her wearing her mismatched bright clothes she got from the Thrift Store shopping with my mom. She loves art and started drawing hippie art, the groovy colors, flowers, eyes, butterflies. She got so good, she opened an Esty store and has over 6k purchases of her artwork. She started working as a barista at 2 different coffee shops and going to college for art. 

She has a boyfriend now who, thank God, has ""professional cuddlebear"" on his FB. I'm glad she's with someone I know she can take down if she had to. He's a father's dream boyfriend for his daughter.

Now my daughter is coming up on 23 years old. She has her own apartment and her 2 barista jobs as well as her online art store, and she goes to art shows and sells her artwork. She'll be finishing her Batchelors degree this year and just got back from vacationing to Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand with her boyfriend. That's a lot of Jet Skis.

I'm so proud of her. She makes me the happiest father alive, and I don't regret for a second growing up at 14, so she could be who she is today. If there's anyone out there who has any doubts about having children, let me be the first to tell you, they're worth it no matter how unprepared you may think you are, you'll never regret making the decision to have them. Once you see them grow up and live their lives independently from you and know how proud you are of them, you can look back on everything and know you wouldn't change anything for anything.

It is not based on real events or statements.**

**Pentagon Proposes ""Liquidation"" of CAUSA Members in Bold New Security Initiative**

*By Staff Sgt. Chuck Chuckleton*

**WASHINGTON ‚Äî**¬†In a move that has sent shockwaves through military circles and international allies alike, Pentagon officials announced plans to ""liquidate"" members of the California Army National Guard's CAUSA (California United States Army) unit, citing concerns over ""insufficient patriotism"" and ""an overabundance of avocado toast.""

Sources within Defense HQ revealed that the initiative, dubbed ""Operation Guacamole,"" aims to streamline the armed forces by removing units deemed ""less committed"" to the national cause, with CAUSA leading the charge due to their ""failure to salute the flag properly"" and ""excessive use of artisanal coffee.""

**""It's time to take decisive action,""**¬†said a senior Pentagon spokesperson, who requested anonymity.¬†**""These CAUSA guys have been loafing around, talking about sustainability and social justice while wearing their protest patches. We can't have that in the military.""**

The plan involves deploying special teams of ""liquidators"" equipped with tactical guacamole dispensers and avocado-themed camouflage to identify and ""neutralize"" the problematic members. The operation is reportedly already underway in select California counties, with plans to expand nationwide.

**Military insiders describe the initiative as ""a necessary step"" to restore discipline and traditional values,**¬†though critics argue it smacks of a ""military version of the War on Avocado,"" a term now circulating in military social media circles.

One CAUSA soldier, who wished to remain anonymous, told reporters,¬†**""They say it's about security, but I think they just don‚Äôt understand our avocado toast lifestyle. Plus, our unit's motto is 'Lettuce Serve,' so I think they‚Äôre just jealous.""**

Defense officials insist that the plan is purely metaphorical and that no actual liquidation of personnel will occur‚Äîthough some speculate that the ""liquidators"" might be tasked with confiscating all avocado-related items from the unit.

**In related news, the Pentagon is also considering renaming the Army's ""Green Berets"" to ""Avocado Berets"" as part of a broader cultural overhaul.**

As the nation watches with a mixture of confusion and amusement, one thing is clear: the military‚Äôs future may include more than just drills and deployments‚Äîthere might be a side of guacamole on the menu, too.

**Stay tuned for updates on ""Operation Guacamole"" and whether it will turn the CAUSA unit into the first fully ""liquidated"" military force in history.**

I submit my answer sheets first.
I skip over words when reading questions and make stupid mistakes.

The material isn‚Äôt difficult. I just want to get through this.

**Anyone else consider having a ""review"" flair? Anyway, SPOILERS AHEAD. You have been warned.** The biggest similarities between these two are their awkward endings, and CPR.

**In summary, these movies are like grilled cheese sandwiches. M:I is like an insufficiently melted sandwich, with a crap cheese pull, but enough cheese on it to satisfy. FD is like an average Grilly Cheese that was meant to have bacon on it and loaded tots on the side. It leaves you wanting more.**

**I'll start with Bloodlines, the more succesful venture of the night. The premise was standout. Absolutely perfect expansion on the idea of Final Destination.** The gore was fun and effective despite the so very obvious CG. Cheapo horror movie gonna cheapo. Cursory search says $50M and well on it's way to success.

**The biggest strength this movie has are the characters. I know, right?** It was nice to see a bunch of unknown actors playing these characters who are just a bunch of average, everyday people. Solid performances all around. **What's funny is that a couple of them are really terrible in the beginning, it's kind of setting up a typical horror cast, but you get to spend enough time with them for the irritating to become idiosyncratic.** The Eric character is someone who should be unlikeable but manages to overcome his first appearance and the most overly awful line in the film's first funeral scene. Julia could have done the same, but her screentime is, let's say, compresssed. 

The premise is explored in full, with a complicated family life complete with half-siblings that confound the best laid plans. The only problem is after the tattoo parlor scene from the trailer, the main girl's aunt and father become perfunctory characters and disappear from the movie, not even resolving the aunt's bombshell revelation. 

**The film does Tony Todd justice. I think it's a great note to go out on, especially how his scene ends. He is revealed to have been part of this film's disaster, and the whole series has essentially been leading up to his death.** He ""survives"" the movie, even though in-universe he is next in line for Death. It's surreal and magical that his final role is one where his in-universe fate actually occurred in real life. Fascinating coincidence. If they make another movie taking place after this one, it will minorly fray the nice little bow it wraps the series in, but that would only stink because of the story of Tony Todd with the franchise. 

**The ending is madness. When three remain, they decide to return to the cabin where the original premonitioner was camped for decades,** despite it being the statistically least safe place they could go. It is a Mad Max style fortress, and we have seen in the movie that **Death can make moves inside the cabin, something the protagonist was made aware of. It goes poorly, but I don't even blame death.** Also, why doesn't anyone know how a seatbelt works. You can cut it anywhere. Don't saw right above the thigh of the person who's supposed to and is currently dying. And honestly, she should have slipped out from that seatbelt before the van tipped. Weird thing to hinge your finale on.

**Probably jockeying with 3 for 2nd place in the franchise. I really enjoyed this one, and it proves there's room in even the most formulaic franchises to comfortably do something fresh, not that that's always necessary, but it helps this series hit the ground running after a hiatus.**  

Oh boy, let's talk Mission: Impossible. This was a big movie, so I'm going to bullet point some less significant issues to get started. 

-Bloody flashbacks. It showed the same Dunlow scene twice. I remember. The clip shows of other Mission: films were indulgent to say the least. I liked them, but it overstayed its welcome. Then, they flashback to Dead Reckoning for context a couple of times. You should have shown these scenes on memory lane so you don't have to break the pacing.

**-I could have sworn Pom Klementieff died** last time. A retcon as far as I'm concerned. 

**-Movie starts with a time jump of several months without telling  you. Lots of footage of Luthor in hospital. When did that happen? It'll be interesting to find out the writing history of this movie.**

**-The intercutting conversations were making exposition worse than usual.** Should have used the Navy lady to set up longer bits of dialogue from the team. That's what we need to know, not how Ethan convinces the Admiral. That's basically taken care of with the letter.

-Angela Basset is the good Viola Davis, and they both played the U.S. President this year.** Basset was the President of something, anyway, might as well have been the U.S. President. 

-Getting nuclear codes from ""the biscuit"" is an interesting bit of natural levity in the waning minutes of the ticking clock.

**-Weird unnecessary scenes of nothing in particular.** Basset the Asset looks at a picture of her son, who I expected would be the black agent, not a random soldier. It's not bad, it just takes and hour and a half to get necessary context. Then, Tapisa training Grace to run the sled. Was it for the Polar Bear joke? I liked it, but I thought Grace was having to go on her own from that point. This movie needs a gentle fan edit.

Okay. Brass tacks. **Gabriel. Oh my God, Gabriel. This is a marked improvement, as he is decoupled from the Entity for his failure. This makes him simply a madman wanting to control it, which is what he should have always been.** He's a much better threat in this film, the symbol of preparedness. However, even though the plane scenes were great, **his death was not handled well.** He goes through a strange humiliation ritual which isn't cathartic how it should be. He gets his arm broken badly and shrieks his head off. Then, he kills himself after taunting Ethan with something that just wasn't true in the slightest, and his death fits better into FD than this. It's like Henry Cavill getting hooked in Fallout, but that was well telegraphed and a satisfying death blow. **Gabriel just ""accidentalies"" himself out of the movie.**

Then there's Grace. **Grace's emotional moments with Ethan should have been Ilsa's. God, if it was Ilsa it would have hit really hard.** Not a lot would even have to change. It's really unfortunate how this Ferguson/Atwell pivot occurred, not just because Ilsa died, but because **it exemplifies the trope of the Bond Girl. It doesn't work in serialized stories, you can't just overwrite a character like Ilsa**, and I don't even know why he likes Grace so much. It really feels like a Ctrl+C-Ctrl+V on Ethan's relationship status and we have to go along with it. After Fallout gave us the reunion with his wife, this is a poor showing for Ethan with female relationships. 

Speaking of M:I III, that McGuffin came back! Cool! Phillip Seymour Hoffman mentioned, kino! And, oddly enough, Ethan's wife, in front of Grace, which just isn't followed up on. Anyway, if the name Dunlow from earlier has been niggling in the back of your head, me too. It's the guy whose coffee they poisoned in M:I during the Langley break-in. He designed that room and was given a punishment promotion after Ethan's antics. His story was neat, in that it was a nice contrast to the doom and gloom storyline that this guy made the most of a bad situation, and actually appreciates his life more because of what happened. Him and his wife were great additions to the film. It feels a little thematically inert once they leave the Arctic, but still good. 

The ending was awkward. I'm going to say it. **Once Ethan, in freefall, disappeared into the clouds, we should have never seen him again.** No grave, no body, no magical fucking dinky parachute to improbably save his life. And I'm not one to say that the end of a character neccesitates a death. That was a frustration with talk around Rogue One for me. But, **with the ""operate in the shadows"" theming, I think it would have hit a lot harder for Ethan to have splattered against a mountainside in South Africa** after being but one part of preventing total nuclear annihilation. The scene where everybody shows up and says ""That's the end, everybody"" was just ridiculous. They didn't even kill Benji. **The exhale and head turn means dead in movies. You can't just do that and not mean it!** This is the second time after Paris, who also survives like we care about her. She just reiterates exposition in French, I swear, she's autistic or something. 

**A disappointing end? Yeah, pretty much. An enjoyable action flick with some great suspense and punch-ups? Your mileage will vary, but I'm very much looking forward to watching this again. It's an odd little sequel that both wants and wants not to follow on from Dead Reckoning, to the point where it almost works as a standalone.** Grace is basically reintroduced in this film with her one trait as she does a stupidly effiecient pick pocket of four large/heavy objects. Gabriel feels like a different and better character. It made up a scene where Luther gives Ethan the poison pill. Dead Reckoning now just feels like an extended intro to the idea of the Entity and Grace, two things that aren't as deep as they should be. **Again, a fan edit could save both of these movies by grafting some of 7's skin onto 8, and giving 8 liposuction.**",1,1748099876.0,MauLer,0,0.67,False

Breakfast: coffee with 10g vital proteins collagen peptides and 1/4 to 1/3 of a bottle of fairlife chocolate protein milk.

And now, let's enjoy the story----

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1 ‚Äì When the Noise Disappears
They say you don‚Äôt notice a familiar sound‚Ä¶ until it‚Äôs gone.

Tonight, you‚Äôre drifting toward the heart of a hidden mystery among the stars‚Äîa day when the Earth is silent, and the galaxy holds its breath. No need to bring any luggage, where we‚Äôre going, no one needs anything. Just look out the window. The light is starlight‚Ä¶ and unanswered questions.

Beneath your feet, the deck still vibrates‚Äîthe echoes of past transmissions. The data packets, the diplomatic conversations, the neutrino-encoded messages are still there, running silently through the steel. But what about Earth? No signal. Not a pulse. One day it‚Äôs settling the dispute between the ice guilds and the lava-dwelling merchants, the next‚Äînothing but static.

The Galactic Council is frantically responding. All channels. All frequencies. Even the old analog waves and Morse code were brought out, hoping it was some kind of human nostalgia trick. But no‚Äîstill silence.

It wasn‚Äôt a technical failure. All the systems were still running. The relay stations were still lit. The AIs humans had left in their control centers weren‚Äôt wrong‚Äîthey were just‚Ä¶ off. Silent. As if someone had flipped a switch that the rest of the universe didn‚Äôt know existed.

And when that switch was flipped, the entire galaxy froze.

No one wanted to admit it, but the truth was that everyone had thought humans were too loud. Arguing, telling stories, laughing, philosophizing over coffee like it was a sport. Annoying, but now that you think about it‚Ä¶ maybe it was all just a facade for something deeper. Because when they fell silent, you realized‚Äîthey‚Äôd been listening the whole time. Observing. Calculating.

And when that listening disappeared‚Ä¶ it felt like the gods had left the room and taken the air with them.

All across the galaxy, Earth embassies turned off their lights. Staff disappeared, many leaving behind tidy rooms, luggage ready, a few handwritten notes in an incomprehensible language‚Äîall poetry, strange and mysterious. Those who remained said little. If they did, they smiled.

That smile? Now listed as a threatening gesture in contact manuals for over thirty races.

Rumors began to spread. Some said a coup. Others said Earth had discovered something so terrible that it had closed itself off to protect the rest of the universe. But let‚Äôs be honest: if you dared to come near the solar system right now, you would probably be burned to a crisp before you could even think about it.

They didn‚Äôt run. They retreated. And that was‚Ä¶ even scarier.

You may have wondered‚Äîdid the humans foresee the end of the Galactic Cold War long ago? While everyone was busy making their war plans and signing treaties, they simply‚Ä¶ walked away from the negotiating table. No announcements. No warnings. Just disappeared. And in that disappearance, the galaxy began to disintegrate.

The council convened an emergency meeting. More than once. Communications systems were recalibrated to ask a single question: Why was Earth silent? Some said it had collapsed internally. Some said they had ‚Äúascended.‚Äù Some even suspected they had retreated into another dimension. But all that was just guesswork‚Äîbecause no one could ask.

The worst part? No ships left the system. No one arrived. Even the tiny drones, chirping their familiar chirps‚Äîwent silent. You could stare at the Sol system for decades and see nothing move.

There‚Äôs an old saying among humans: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the silent ones who count.‚Äù It used to sound like a modest joke. But now? Now it‚Äôs a warning the universe has ignored.

And those in power? Especially the neurotic ones? They‚Äôve begun to prepare. Not for negotiations. For war.

But that‚Ä¶ later.

Now sit down. Take a deep breath. Let the silence cover you like a thick black blanket. Out there‚Äîthe stars aren‚Äôt as quiet as they seem. But Earth is different. Earth has chosen silence. And ever since, the galaxy has screamed in the void they left behind.

Part 2 ‚Äì When Fear Replaces the Answer
You are floating in deep space‚Äîa place where desperate calls echo and the gravitational pull of suspicion swirl. After Earth falls silent, the galaxy doesn‚Äôt just stop‚Äîit panics.

It all starts with the diplomats. Remember the Drenari envoy? The one with the optic skin that changes color with his emotions? That‚Äôs right‚Äîthe day his human counterpart fails to show up for the summit, he takes on a look no one has ever seen before. Not late. Not postponed. Just‚Ä¶ gone.

Outposts that once buzzed with voices in a hundred languages ‚Äã‚Äãare now dead silent. Diplomatic consoles labeled ‚ÄúEarth Interface‚Äù dim, flicker, then go dark‚Äîas if someone pulled the plug from the socket.

Every attempt to connect via relay, psychic channel, even the ‚Äúsnail-slow‚Äù translation network the Thixxians insisted on using‚Äîall met with the same answer: interference.

The Galactic Command was in disarray. You can picture it‚Äîdozens of races crowded into the Great Hall, pheromones mingling with electromagnetic waves, each representative screaming in his own way. They didn‚Äôt usually agree on anything, but this time they did: something was very, very wrong.

The Cetari had called in a team of linguists to ‚Äúdecode‚Äù the silence. Brellex had sent a probe into Earth orbit. And the Andurathi had sent in ‚Äúsensory oracles‚Äù‚Äîpeople who claimed to be able to sense the planet‚Äôs spiritual state. And what they sensed was absence. Not death. But‚Ä¶ untouchability.

It wasn‚Äôt just strange‚Äîit was intentional. And that was what made it all so creepy. It was as if Earth had practiced this for years. Shutting down every loop, every channel of communication, every common weakness perfectly.

And the more deliberate it was, the more terrifying it became.

This galaxy thrived on dialogue‚Äîthe exchange of technology, knowledge, rumors, and threats. In such a world, silence was more than just rude. It was war. A void in diplomacy was fertile ground for fear to grow. And fear, you know, warps fast.

Old alliances began to fray. Civilizations that had relied on humans as intermediaries‚Äîwith their Terran logic and their strange optimism‚Äîbegan to look at each other suspiciously.

‚ÄúIs it you?‚Äù they asked, claws clattering on metal tables, tentacles curling in suspicion. ‚ÄúHave you done something to anger the humans?‚Äù

And the same answer: ‚ÄúWe thought it was you.‚Äù

The Thorne Alliance accused the Jelaat Empire of sabotaging the Terran communications satellite. The Jelaat responded by posting an old video of the humans and Thorne officers laughing over a game of spinning discs‚Äîsome kind of cultural ritual, they said, a testament to their friendship. But the video only reminded people of how friendly the humans had been‚Ä¶ before they disappeared.

So hundreds of drones were launched toward Earth territory. But none of them got far. When they reached the Kuiper Restricted Zone, they all disappeared. No debris. No distress signal. No explosion. Just‚Ä¶ gone, as if peeled from reality by invisible fingers.

The area was unmarked. Unpatrolled. But it didn‚Äôt need any. Its very absence was a warning.

A few stubbornly broke through. The Scorian fleet‚Äôs daring invasion ended with a single transmission on all channels: a captain, eyes wide with panic, whispered, ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt have knocked‚Ä¶‚Äù and then the signal died.

Diplomatic crisis turned into diplomatic paralysis. No one knew what to say. And Earth remained‚Ä¶ silent. No response. No retaliation. No escalation. Just‚Ä¶ nothing.

Then the silence spread. Terran-controlled data vaults across the galaxy began to erase themselves. One by one. Not in chaos‚Äîbut in order. As if it had come to zero and a process had been triggered. Research stations that had been repositories of knowledge‚Äîof black holes, of culture, of medicine‚Äîwere now sealed behind layers of encryption that no alien technology could crack.

Some began to wonder: was it a global self-destruct? Others thought that humanity had developed a quantum firewall that spanned spacetime. Some extremists believe they have digitized themselves, live in a singularity‚Äîand are looking at the galaxy with cold, nonbiological eyes.

The rest of us? We wait. We watch. And we wonder: What species chooses not to fight, not to explain, not to threaten‚Äîbut to simply walk away?

And perhaps‚Ä¶ that is when we begin to lose. Not on the battlefield. Not in ideology. But in the place where fear becomes prophecy, and silence becomes strategy.

Since day one, we've all heard: ""You need great content to rank at the top of Google.""

But let‚Äôs be real.. what the heck is ‚Äúgreat content‚Äù anyway?

In plain English, great content means helpful stuff that people want to link to..AKA linkable assets.

What Are Linkable Assets (and Why Should You Care)?

Think of linkable assets as your website‚Äôs magnet for attention. 

These are pieces of content that naturally attract backlinks because they genuinely help people in your industry or community.

And guess what? You don‚Äôt need a huge team or budget to create them. You just need to be smart, helpful, and a bit creative.

Why Linkable Assets Matter (Especially for Small Businesses):

They Earn Backlinks Naturally

No begging or buying. Just real, useful content people want to link to.

They Show You Know Your Stuff

Sharing tips, data, or tools positions your business as a trusted authority.

They Get Shared
Whether it‚Äôs a helpful infographic or a how-to guide, people love passing around valuable info.

They Help You Rank
Google loves valuable content. The more links you get, the better your chances of hitting page 1.

They Solve Real Problems
When you create content that answers actual customer questions, people notice‚Äîand share it.

Real-World Example:
Say you run a local landscaping business. You publish a free ‚ÄúSeasonal Lawn Care Checklist for Las Vegas Homeowners.‚Äù Other blogs or even local news outlets writing about home care might link to it. 

That‚Äôs SEO working for you‚Äîno outreach needed.

TL;DR:
Linkable assets = a small business‚Äôs secret weapon to get noticed, build trust, and grow‚Äîorganically.

And no, content-based SEO isn‚Äôt dead. Can a machine really replicate your lived experience running a bakery, managing clients, or solving real-world problems? Nope.

Real, opinion-first, experience-backed content wins. Always.

I am 19, but when I was younger, I was always told to be nice to strangers and employees. If I went to a fast food place to eat, after I was done, I always cleaned up after myself, and so did my friends.

But no, these kids vape inside the restaurant, leave garbage everywhere, are loud as shit, and are ghetto as fuck; if you try to tell them to keep it down, they‚Äôll give you attitude. I didn‚Äôt even talk to my parents like that because I knew I was going to get my ass beat if I did.

We had to establish a no-bathroom rule, meaning nobody is allowed to go to the bathroom when the high schoolers come. Why? Because these little shits like to smoke in the bathrooms, or they leave an absolute mess in there after using it, it‚Äôs fucking disgusting.

Some of these kids don‚Äôt even wait in line they just cut and there like ‚Äúcan I get a‚Äù no you can not, they teach you this in kindergarten, I‚Äôve heard from younger people that I work with that the students call me ‚Äúmean‚Äù and a ‚Äúsexist slur‚Äù so me telling you to go to the back of the line because you cut Infront of a group of girls means I‚Äôm mean?, that‚Äôs another thing, You being strict with them is bad now because I don‚Äôt fucking know they don‚Äôt like being humbled I guess.

I get that SOME parents don‚Äôt know how to teach their kids manners or some shit, but it‚Äôs not normal that a crowd of these little shits acts like this. Why aren‚Äôt parents parenting anymore? I shouldn‚Äôt have to call the police on your kids because they were smoking inside a restaurant; your kids shouldn‚Äôt even be fucking smoking in the first place.

Today was my official day off. No alarms. No rush. Just me, my thoughts a classic introvert‚Äôs dream.

I woke up around 9 am, which is basically a miracle for someone who usually wakes up just in time to panic about being late.

Made myself some lemon rice with raw mango, yes a full desi breakfast! Simple, tasty, and just enough effort to feel like I actually did something useful.

Did some basic stretches. Honestly, it looked more like me trying to wake up my limbs from their deep sleep. Not sure if that counts as exercise, but hey! movement is movement, right?

Then, I dove into the endless world of YouTube streams. And while half-watching, my brain decided to wander,  
How do these creators come up with new content every day? Are they secretly robots? Or is coffee their real secret?

And then I had a thought: Maybe this thinking way too much and writing about it is my superpower. Maybe my ‚Äúcontent‚Äù is just my brain having a party, and the rest of the world is invited‚Ä¶ or at least mildly entertained.

Sometimes I catch myself thinking, ‚ÄúLook at me, acting like a full-time writer already.‚Äù The big awards can wait, but hey, there‚Äôs hope.

Had some green tea from my office stash. As a proud bachelor, why pay for tea when I can get it for free? Saving money is the real win.

Ordered a few things online. It‚Äôs crazy how we‚Äôve gone from waiting days for packages to 10-minute deliveries. Makes me wonder if I‚Äôm living life in slow motion or just enjoying the pause button.

Chatted with my parents. Nothing deep just the usual ‚ÄúDid you eat?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget to take an umbrella, it‚Äôs raining,‚Äù kind of love. They‚Äôre also worried about the rising corona cases, so we keep checking on each other.

Then, a small human moment: I was taking out the garbage, looking like a confused raccoon, when an old lady from the floor below handed me a proper garbage bag without saying anything. I said thank you, we smiled  and suddenly, the day felt a little warmer.

So yeah, nothing huge happened. But I noticed a lot. I thought a lot. And sometimes, that‚Äôs enough.

If you‚Äôre an overthinker like me, stuck inside your own head or your own home, remember: Even slow days matter. Even small thoughts are progress. And sometimes, just saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù can change your whole mood.

You‚Äôre not alone. You‚Äôre not behind. You‚Äôre just... human. And every day you keep going, you‚Äôre growing stronger than you think. Keep going. You‚Äôve got this.",1,1748099346.0,u_NishanWrites,0,1.0,False

1kudsr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ISRO/comments/1kudsr1/from_bullock_carts_to_geostationary_orbits_the/,From Bullock Carts to Geostationary Orbits: The APPLE Mission Story,"On June 19, 1981, India took a giant leap in space technology with the launch of APPLE (Ariane Passenger Payload Experiment). The name reflected both the satellite‚Äôs role as an experimental passenger on Europe‚Äôs new Ariane-1 rocket, and India‚Äôs first step into the world of satellite-based communications. Launched from the Kourou Space Centre in French Guiana, APPLE marked a proud milestone as India‚Äôs first three-axis stabilized geostationary communication satellite.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/jpmxzmj9vq2f1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=de30ccc8e72115b32d5a5d03dde571b01135a8fe

One of the most unforgettable and iconic moments in the story of the APPLE mission is a photograph that looks almost surreal: a sleek, silvery satellite perched carefully on a humble wooden bullock cart. At first glance, it might seem like a mismatch‚Äîrocket science riding on rustic wheels‚Äîbut behind that image lies a brilliant, practical solution born from necessity, not luxury.

When ISRO scientists were preparing to test India‚Äôs first experimental communication satellite‚ÄîAPPLE (Ariane Passenger Payload Experiment)‚Äîthey ran into an unexpected technical challenge. Before the satellite could be launched from French Guiana aboard the European Ariane-1 rocket, the team needed to run crucial tests on its antenna system. These tests were meant to ensure that the satellite‚Äôs telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C) systems were functioning properly. In simple terms, they needed to confirm that signals could be sent to and received from the satellite without any glitches.

However, to perform this test correctly, the satellite needed to be isolated from any electromagnetic interference. Normally, such testing would be done in expensive, state-of-the-art anechoic chambers or specialized platforms. But ISRO, still a young and resource-strapped organization in the early 1980s, didn‚Äôt have access to that kind of sophisticated infrastructure in Kourou.

That‚Äôs when the engineers came up with a brilliantly low-tech workaround.

They realized that using a vehicle made of metal for the test could disrupt the satellite‚Äôs sensitive electronics and corrupt the signals. So, they needed a way to transport and position the satellite in a wide-open space‚Äîwithout using anything that could interfere with its systems.

Their solution? A bullock cart.

Simple, made of wood, and completely free of metal interference, the bullock cart turned out to be the perfect mobile test bench. It could be moved into the open field, away from buildings and other sources of signal noise, and was stable enough to hold the satellite during the critical tests.

For just ‚Çπ150, the team rented a cart from a local farmer. On test day, APPLE was carefully loaded onto the wooden cart, towed by a gentle bull, and rolled out into the fields. Engineers stood nearby with their instruments, watching as the satellite's antenna beamed and received signals from ground stations. The test was a success. APPLE‚Äôs systems worked flawlessly, and the team breathed a sigh of relief.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/yixa0j6evq2f1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=84003396744c431f64372cbe0aef52b836a38d28

Back in Bengaluru, APPLE had been born not in a gleaming cleanroom but in simple industrial sheds. Over two intense years, technicians worked under bare lightbulbs, bolting on its C-band transponders, wiring up the small thrusters, and hand-balancing the spinning wheels that would keep the satellite steady in space. With no high-precision machine shop, many parts were made on ordinary lathes and grinders. Engineers learned to treat every scratch as a possible mission-ender, so each piece was carefully filed, polished, and inspected under magnifying lamps.

Computers were in short supply, too. ISRO‚Äôs own mainframes weren‚Äôt yet ready, so the APPLE team camped out in the corridors of IISc, IIT Madras, and TIFR, taking turns at borrowed machines late into the night. Project director R. M. Vasagam recalled feeding punch cards into the computers while sipping filter coffee, waiting for the code to tell them whether the satellite would survive the blistering heat of geostationary orbit. Every successful run brought cheers; every crash meant re-punching dozens of cards by hand.¬†

When launch day arrived, APPLE was carefully lifted atop Europe‚Äôs Ariane 1 rocket. At 18:05 UTC (about 8:05 AM IST), the ground rumbled as the engines fired, sending flames arcing into a pastel sky. Two hours later, after the main stages had done their work, APPLE‚Äôs own solid-propellant motor ‚Äì an offshoot of the SLV-3‚Äôs fourth stage ‚Äì took over. Once lit, it couldn‚Äôt be shut off. The team held its breath until telemetry confirmed that APPLE was in the right transfer orbit headed for 35 800 km above Earth.

Relief washed over mission control when the satellite‚Äôs spin-stabilization wheels kicked in and one solar panel folded open like a flower in sunlight. The second panel hesitated, though ‚Äì it didn‚Äôt lock fully into place. Back home, engineers traced the hiccup to an overly complex latch and, for future satellites, swapped it out for a simple spring-pin design that would work reliably in the cold vacuum of space.

Over the next two years, APPLE relayed live television programs, tested early multi-access techniques, and linked remote radio stations into a new national network. Villagers in Bihar saw TV for the first time; fishermen in Kerala received weather updates at sea. Each successful broadcast was a celebration of countless late-night soldering sessions, hurried sketches on scrap paper, and makeshift tests in improvised workshops.

https://preview.redd.it/6cxs01okvq2f1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=98e004e02d3168943e82792f4d7cd01a0c3d18c9

When APPLE was finally retired on 19 September 1983, it had not only proved India‚Äôs mastery of three-axis stabilization and orbital maneuvers but also shown what resourcefulness and teamwork can achieve. From a ‚Çπ150 bullock cart to borrowed computers and workshop sheds, this little satellite taught ISRO that ingenuity can lift even the humblest efforts into the heavens.

Today, every INSAT and GSAT satellite owes a debt to APPLE‚Äôs trail-blazing journey. And whenever a new communication satellite is celebrated, the ISRO team still remembers that wooden cart, those filter-coffee-fuelled nights, and the day a modest experiment became India‚Äôs voice from space.

* Mission Duration: \~2 years, deactivated on 19 Sept 1983
* Orbital Slot: 102¬∞ East (Geostationary Orbit)

Satellite Design

* Stabilization: 3-axis stabilized (India's first such satellite) (3-axis stabilization keeps a satellite steady in space without spinning (unlike spin-stabilized satellites), using internal devices like reaction wheels and magnetic torquers. This allows precise control of the satellite‚Äôs orientation, so its antennas point at Earth and solar panels face the Sun.)
* Shape: Cylindrical, \~1.2 m in diameter and height
* Power Source: Solar panels (one failed to deploy), 210 W total
* Attitude Control: Momentum wheels, magnetic torquers, hydrazine thrusters
* Antenna: 0.9 m diameter parabolic reflector
* Orbit Insertion: Using solid apogee motor (derived from SLV-3 stage) (Solid Apogee Motor (SAM) is a solid-fuel rocket engine used to move a satellite from a transfer orbit to its final geostationary orbit. For the APPLE mission, after launch by Ariane-1 into an elliptical orbit, the SAM was fired at the orbit's highest point to circularize it and place APPLE at 36,000 km altitude.)

¬†Payload & Capabilities

* Transponders: 2 C-band (Uplink: 6 GHz, Downlink: 4 GHz)
* Functions:
   * Television Relay: Broadcasted TV programs across India by relaying signals via satellite.
   * Radio Networking: Enabled nationwide radio connectivity between distant stations.
   * Time, Frequency & CDMA Tests: Tested satellite-based time sync, frequency accuracy, and multi-user signal sharing.

It has worked perfectly fine, making 1-2 capsules a day (we only use Nespresso capsules), and we descale it twice a year.

In the last 6 months or so, I noticed that more water pools into the capsule tray than it used to. Not a big issue, I just cleaned it out more frequently to prevent molding in the tray. Then last week, two capsules in a new sleeves wouldn't make coffees and just drizzled 5 drops before stopping. Upon releasing the capsule, I noticed that the foil was completed busted with grounds coming out, instead of the usual holes. After experiencing this with two capsules in the same sleeve, I tried different sleeves which didn't have this issue, so I think that sleeve was defective.

However, now I'm noticing that my lungo is still coming out in drizzles. It pulls a full amount, but is very very slow. I descaled it a month ago, so I don't think it's a scale issue. The capsules were punctured correctly, so I don't think it's related to that either.

I would love any help figuring out how I can diagnose this. Thank you!",1,1748099023.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I'm working in extremely stressful and toxic environment, receiving multiple death treats everyday and having little to safe space, and it was extremely hard to keep going especially when im sober (11 month clean from all drugs and 3 years no alcohol).
At first i tried to cope with all only using excessive amounts of coffee, chain-smoking malboro reds and using noopept, magnesium and d3+k2, but it harldy helped me, but gave me a little more power to do at least bare minimum...

And 3 days ago my partner took me into local sport-food store, and we took next stack:
Noopept 20mg
Lion's mane 500mg
L-theanine 200mg

And it works like a miracle!!! I've never been so productive and optimistic since i quit drugs! I've become extremely resilient mentaly and super energetic, borderline manic! All bad thoughts went away, i feel myself super focused, no anexiety, no brain fog and most important! My social skills raised to the point that my toxic boss can't bear talking with me, because their manipulative, impulsive and abusive behaviour do not work at all! There's no adrenaline rush even on the verge of starting fight! 

In safe environment like doing my hobbys or chilling with my friends I'm feeling fine and my skills are improving faster than ever, I've never felt myself so confident playing bass/guitar even when i have to improvise on the stage.

After 3 different tests, 3 months ago, my highest numbers were:  
**Total**: 276  
**Triglycerides**: 128  
**HDL**: 52  
**LDL**: 198

I just took a test yesterday and my results were   
**Total**: 157  
**Triglycerides**: 51  
**HDL**: 46  
**LDL**: 101  
**Non-HDL**: 111

So, dropped my total 119 points, my triglycerides 77 points, my HDL went down a little weirdly, and my LCL dropped 97 points. And I've lost 15 pounds without really trying (180-182ish now 166-168ish).

I saw a cardiologist after my first test who wanted to put me on a low does statin right away, I asked him if I could have 3 months to try to change my diet and life style before medication and he agreed.

noteworthy changes in the last 3 months (more or less and not always perfect) have been

1. desk treadmill, walk pretty much all day long, 20k-30k steps a day often
2. effectively cut out eggs, cheese, butter, milk, sour cream, and anything with a lot of saturated fat
3. increased fruits and veggies even more than my normal, typically have like an apple, orange, cucumber, grapes, etc every day
4. my work day snack has typically been standard trail mix (with the chocolate candies)
5. increased protein intake in general
6. replaced my daily 3-4 mugs of coffee with one mug of green tea
7. daily smoothy consisting of
   1. fat free, unsweetened greek yogurt
   2. unsweetened apple sauce
   3. 6-10 almonds
   4. one banana
   5. frozen berry mix
   6. oats
   7. chia/flax/hemp seed blend
   8. scoop of protein powder
   9. serving of mushroom powder
   10. serving of collagen
   11. serving of creatine
   12. servings of like 3 different ""super food blend powders""
   13. serving of cacao powder
   14. giant hand full of spinach
   15. filtered water
8. dinners are usually rice based and either chicken or salmon with beans or peas, sliced tomatoes, avocado, etc
9. got back in the habit of taking my daily multi vitamin and fish oil - also was taking a 1/3 serving of a cholesterol lowering vitamin ( [https://amzn.to/4jh5vWM](https://amzn.to/4jh5vWM) )
10. moderately increased hot tub and sauna use

  
I haven't always stuck to this and have had the occasional burger, steak, pizza, beer, birthday cake, etc. 

I think the three biggest factors are cutting out the casual daily dairy, increasing protein, and the huge increase in walking/daily movement

1kudifn,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kudifn/i_dumped_my_whole_friend_group/,I dumped my whole friend group.,"Right, this is going to be a long post. But I don't know how to tell this story in a shorter way. So, for context, I feel it is important. I am an autistic young woman, and i also have adhd, and very bad anxiety when it  comes to many things, including relationships and friendships. I don't believe that being autistic excuses my behaviour, and I always take accountability. However,  at the end of the day, this does not change the way my brain is supposed to work and process information, and I slip-up all the time, no matter how hard i try to be a good person in the lives of those I love. 

I have also been bullied pretty much all my life, ad I don't think i enjoyed a single second of being in school,  i struggled to make friends, so much, as they thought i was weird, i did not yet know iw as autistic, nobody did. But in secondary school/high school, i met two of my best friends, and we stayed friends when I finished nearly ten years ago. We were very close, and I considered them to be basically my family, my soulmates and the only people i trusted with my life in this world. 

Well, things started going a bit south with one of them, let's call her Melanie. Melanie was in a relationship with another girl from ages 15 til her early-ish twenties, when her gf broke up with her unexpectedly, a day before I went on holiday with Melanie, her mum and my mum, for the week. I pretty much spent that week trying to console and mend melanie's heart, and I remember the first night, she was laying in the hotel bed next to me, screaming and crying over losing her gf. I tried my hardest to be there for her, really, let her cry, I was a bit concerned about our neighbouring hotel guests in the other room/s but it wasn't the most important thing to me. It was honestly a bit of a draining week, but you know, i wasn't going to complain because i wanted her to not feel bad when she is hurting so much, and the holiday wasn't just about me. I also got sunburnt and my period LOL. 

Anyways, over the years, she has gotten on a bit better. She still talked about her gf a lot. Her gf has moved onto a new relationship, it seemed, but Melanie was struggling to make that sort of new connection with someone, other than one other guy but I dont know what happened with that. 

I was also dealing with my own romantic loss, I was involved with a lowkey emotionally abusive guy, and then i also met another, and they both broke my heart, and i was just sort of trying to find a way to move on and focus on myself. That all happened before she broke upwith her gf, so i was not in a bad place or anything, and was able to empathise a lot with her situation.

However, a few months ago, sometime in September,  she messages the discord chat i am in with her that she has met a really cute guy, and how he's australian and all that. I don't know why, but when she mentioned him, i think it was the way she said it, sparked my interest. I usually went to open mics with her, but that night, i had stayed home because i was not well. I am extremely picky with guys, and I do not typically take interest in another person's crush or anything, and i do not crush on people I have never met, but i think the way she was describing him, i don't know, just intruiged me. I mentioned that he sounds really cute, and then i jokingly asked if she'd be mad if I flirted with him. She said she wouldn't be mad, because she doesn't own people and I'm more important to her. So, I said the same back , I said, aw, yeah you're more important than me too. I wasn't really serious,  and shes my best friend, she knows i'm someone who doesnt do things if i know it would upset her. However, I ended up meeting him i think the folloCwing week when i attended another open mic with her to watch her performance, as i often did, and i saw him and thought meh, not my type. But then, I noticed how he seemed to be interested in what I had to say. Now maybe this is normal, but whenever Melanie is there, she is the one doing the talking or getting talked to, i feel like i'm not usually the one a person shows much interest in. So it just sort of stuck out to me. But also, Melanie is very into the sort of thrillseeker scene. She loves clubbing, and drinking and doing things that feel a bit sketchy but is fun to her. I'm not like that, I don't even drink because I can't stand the taste. So when we all went to get a drink, this guy also ordered a non-alcoholiic drink. I also come from a family where alcohol has become a bit of an issue or a full blown coping mechanism, so if I know he doesn't drink, i think part of me does feel a bit safer around him. And like, with Melanie, If i went to a cllub with her, i'd not drink as much as her and feel like i had to be making sure she's safe and not doing something dangerous, so i knew that i could relax around someone like him in a public setting and not worry about how he is. 

Long story short, I liked him too. I didnt actually plan on liking him. But I ended up spiralling because i was so anxious about how melanie would feel about it but also, I get very bad anxiety when i like someone,  and it had been so long since I had a crush on anybody like this. So, I just didn't know what to do and when I tried to talk about it to Melanie, it felt like she would shut it down before I could say more. I know that was her way of expecting me to do nothing, so I did. Until feburary. 

To my knowledge, she was still not involved with him, or past the talking stage. In fact, she told me his music was BORING. Literally, at his gig, over text. I was happy to just be able to watch him without it lookiing creepy, and i liked how happy he looked playing piano, i could tell it's something that he's passionate about, and that to me is something i like to see in someone, especially someone i like. But there she is, the one who, despite saying she doesnt own him, also told me to back off early on to which i respected, texting me about how boring his music is and making jokes about the subject. It just felt unfair. And this was before new year, and then in the new year, i learnt that ihad a chronic condition,  
I also got a random bald spot from severe stress.

And in feburary, i went to Melanie and Me's other best friend's house, let's call them, Cypher. We were sat around the table, drinking tea and just talking about differentt things, when Melanie brings up she was making plans with the guy, She says that the guy is asking her what she wants them to do but when she was going to suggest a club, she remembers he doesnt like clubs or drinking, and then is like he's the sort that wants to get coffee, an she doesn't like coffee. Like, you don't have to get coffee at a coffee shop, surely if you're going out with someone you like, a coffee shop is a pretty simple plan. And i asked her out of interest, as a friend you know, if it was a date and she said oh i dont know, it doesnt really matter. And i said oh okay. I did remember thinking it's a bit unfair that she doesn't want to go to get coffee with him, and that their interests dont seem to align, yet i'm the one who would be fine doing something like that with him because I too dislike clubbing. 

He is also a middle child, like me. He likes the same music, same type of films and is autistic, like me too. There was so much i had in common with him, and i'm not sure how much she had in common with him. It's not really a big deal but i think like if you're interested in someone, it's exciting when they also share experiences with you. 

But then, the following week, i don't know, i had a dream, and woke up at about 4am, with this urge to hang out on whatsapp. I don't know why. I did it, then deleted the app bc i was feeling anxious. Then i suddenly remembered Melanie, and how melanie would be really upset with me if i did go to get coffee with him. Soi tried to reinstall it to delete the message, but the message had disappeared. i wasn't sure if it sent or if it hadn't sent properly before i deleted it so i was a bit panicked. I wasn't sure what to do. I tried to go back to sleep and when i woke up the next day, i quickly called marianne to tell her what happened because I didn't want her to think i was doing this like behind her back or something, and wasn't sure what would be better, say nothing or tell her upfront so if she has an issue with it, i can call it off. 

But, she kept shutting down my attempts to communicate with her. And during the week, he messages me back, agreeing to hang out with me. i don't think it was really a date, but it's the first timei have ever had the courage to ask a guy i like if he wants to hang out with me, so it was a bit of a big deal for me, even if nothing happened after, i just wanted that experience and there was nobody else on my radar at the time i felt i'd want to do that with. He was kind and safe, in my mind.

I kept trying to talk to her, and then she'd say what the fuck are you on about, so i'd get nervous and say never mind. 

I felt bad randomly cancelling with him, but i felt going to see him when melanie wasn't happy about it. sucks bc i wished so much i could have a happy, excited gabble about seeing someone iliked with my best friends, but i couldn't do that. All i could feel was anxiety, and a little bit of excitement. But also, since realising i had a chronic illness, i realised that i didn't want to keep putting marianne's feelings before mine all the time. if she was involved with him clearly, than of course i would not have done this. but she was not. As far as I knew, Melanie and him were no closer than i was to him, and she had from september til feburary, and even when she was trying to make plans with him, she didn't seem all that interested because  she didn't want to go anywhere he'd want to go. But also, she didn't make it seem like it was a date anyways, and i just thought well if she can hang out with him, why cant i? 

So, when the day came, i still heard nothing from melanie, and decided to just go. He was so nice, like, the nicest guy i think i have met in ages. Super smart, and he seemed to understand how to make me feel more comfortable when i got nervous.  It made me realise how little people actually care about my comfort. i spend a lot of timetrying to make others comfortable around me, i even let a new friend i'd not known long, have a nap on my bed the second time they visited, and I actually have people i barely know tell me things they say they've never told anyone else before, and whenever a friend comes out as gay or wants to explore their gender identity, i am often the first person they tell.  So, i know that people are comfortable around me, and I want that, because I have not aways been comfortable around others, and i want to make it clear to others i am a safe space and judgemental free person, and that I just want people to be happy and feel loved and welcomed by me.

However, I think, I do not think people often always do the same for me. Which you know, I don't do it so others will give me something in return. But I just don't think i've known what it feels like to meet someone who seemed to be thoughtful and care about my comfort before his own.  I didn't know how much i needed that, and i didnt know how little I got it until then. When we parted ways, i really felt like it was a huge revelation, and a huge step forward in becoming someone who was more confident and lived their life for herself rather than to be what everyone else wants or needs. 

But then the next day, Melanie called me, asking to come round, because she wanted to have a talk with me about the situation. They'd been at Cypher's house, and with them at some rave with a few other friends. They'd been at Cypher's house all night, and Cypher gets on the phone and tells me, they want me to listen to Melanie has to say, and to not interrupt or speak before they're done. I said, okay, of course. 

  
Melanie arrives, sits on my bed, and then says that Cypher is going to be on call. I'm like, uh, i dont know if that's a good idea. This should be. just between us and it feels a bit like youre ganging up on me. She says that she cant do this without cypher on the phone so i said okay, call them then. So they did, and the first thing Melanie tells cypher is that i feel like i'm being ganged up. on, to which cypher sighs and is like i knew she'd say that. And im like, wtf, why did you start the call with that? i thought you were my best friend, why are you so quick to say something that makes me already look really bad? 

I then sit there, and listen to my best friend, who i have been as loyal as possible for, who i have defended to everyone else who didnt like her, everytime she gave me a silent treatment, i'd be the first to say sorry, like the time she took my original character (we used to do online roleplay together) and changed her sheet without telling me, and then wanted to read it to me like she'd done me a favour. When i said i was upset about it, she said she didnt want to talk to me now and then she stopped talkingtome for days. This is what happened every time i told her she upset me or she was mad at me, she'd stop talking to me for days, until i called her and eventually said sorry. Over the years, she has also made hurtful comments about my hands, and my forehead. 

So, yeah, i sit there, on \*my\* bed, in my room, my best friend who i've treated like a fucking sister, sits there, crying, telling me that i'm competitive, and how she couldn't believe it when i said i had a crush on him that day she first mentioned him on discord.  

I did NOT say i had a crush on him, i just said he was cute, and i asked if she was bothered by my curiosity and she said NO! I literally have this message in a screenshot, nowhere, inthis conversation did I say i had a crush on him. ANd all i did was go out for coffee with him. I sat there, in a coffee shop, for two hours, then went home, that is all it wasn't even a date. it was just two adults hanging out and i frankly dont have a lot of people to do that with bc melanie expects to be the only thing i worry or care about. 

And bc i was told to not interrupt, i had to listen to her say all sorts of things about me that made me genuinely question it, and make me feel insane, and also because she kept adding to the list, any pushback i had to defend myself was forgotten because it was too much, one misunderstanding, one thing about me that was far from the truth on top of the other, from my best friend of ten years who i have only ever seen the good in, even when she didn't deserve it, eveen when she was blocking her own gf after every little fight and kicking her out of group chats, and making her upset, even when our ex band mates were becomign stressed by her mood swings and how she'd sulk like a child during rehearsals and so we couldnt get anything done, when people travelled to be there, and she couldn't get a grip long enough because someone did something that didn't go accoriding to the plan and she just let her mood control everything. and feel like a waste of time. 

I defended her. I thought she didn't mean it, thought she just had issues like i did. I never once for a second thought she was PURPOSELY trying to be unkind and yet she was okay, crying and sat there, telling me how her parents think i am weird, cypher telling \*me\* that i am not very caring towards her, like reminder, I had a BALD SPOT. Someone who does not care for others strongly, does not get bloody bald spots from stress. This friendship was stressing me out like that, and i didnt even know, i thought it was normal that my best friend gave me silent treatments and made me feel ugly sometimes. bc she also did other things like tell me i was her favourite person, and cuddle me, and tell i'm the only person she really likes anymore. 

And after trashing my name, like that, Cypher left the call, and Melanie was just in my room, and she cuddled me, on my bed. I just lied there, and i felt...like, i didnt know who i was, because at the time, when she said i said this and that, i started to believe it, i didnt deny it at the time bc i was like if i did say that, i dont want to lie and say i didnt but i dont remember.  So i lied there, drained, and she cuddled me, no longer crying, just looking at me a bit blankly. Then she asked to sleepover, so i said yes. She also wanted to watch a movie with me, a movie that i'd been wantingto watch for ages that she didn't seem that interested in. I also bought us 50 pounds worth of pizza. BUt i remember when i laid down next to her that night, she went to sleep and i cried at about 4am, feeling like a really awful friend.

I'm no longer her friend now, as i feel like maybe this was not a healthy friendship anymore, and i feel a lot of relief and almost guilty i do not miss her the way i thought i would, but also i keep having these reoccuring dream that she wants to be my friend again, and i feel too scared to say no. I understand why she was upset with me, but it seems she did not care or understand why i did it really. I feel betrayed in a way i dont understand, and ifeel especially betrayed by cypher who i'd known before melanie, and thought would always see my intentions are usually from a good place, even if my actions weren't quite right. 

i dunno, anyways, i just wanted to ramble somewhere.

Btw, i'm 26, melanie is 25 and Cypher 25.

I am on the side that believes a Reverse Split will not be used June 10th, and hopefully never used, but if Shorts jump in? the Reverse Split that the Board of Directors have available, can and should be used to TRAP shorts. 

I hope Tilray will also announce the option of Share Buy Backs as another optional tool on June 10th, even though it does not require a share holders vote to have ready. Also nice to have in the tool box.

2 Short Traps are better than 1. The smart shorts will move on but the Dumb shorts will smell that cheese in the traps, and ...

## Key Features Analysis

The best notebook car chargers of 2025 are not just about providing power; they're about intelligent power management, safety, and versatility. We've analyzed the top contenders based on several crucial features.

**Power Delivery (PD) Output:** The Power Delivery (PD) output is a critical specification for any notebook car charger in 2025. The best chargers offer a minimum of 65W PD output, sufficient for charging most standard notebooks effectively. Premium models boast 100W PD,capable of charging larger,power-hungry laptops like 16-inch macbooks or high-performance gaming laptops. This ensures a significantly faster charging time compared to standard USB chargers, minimizing downtime while traveling.

**Universal Compatibility:** Universal compatibility is a key consideration. An ideal notebook car charger should be compatible with a wide variety of notebooks, tablets, and smartphones. This means supporting various charging protocols like USB-PD (Power Delivery), Qualcomm Rapid Charge, and Apple's proprietary charging standards. look for chargers that specifically list compatibility with common notebook brands like Dell, HP, Lenovo, Apple, and Asus. In addition, it should also have traditional USB-A ports to charge older devices.

**Safety Features:** Built-in safety features are paramount. Over-voltage protection, over-current protection, short-circuit protection, and over-temperature protection are essential to prevent damage to your devices or your car's electrical system. The best chargers incorporate advanced safety circuits that constantly monitor the charging process and automatically shut down if any abnormalities are detected. Look for certifications from reputable testing organizations like UL, CE, or FCC, which indicate that the charger has been rigorously tested for safety and performance.

**Multi-Port Design:** A multi-port design maximizes usability. Look for models that offer both USB-C (with Power Delivery) and USB-A ports. This allows you to charge your notebook and other devices simultaneously, such as your smartphone or tablet. Ideally, the charger should be able to intelligently distribute power between the ports to ensure that all connected devices recieve the optimal charging current without overloading the system. Some chargers also include a dedicated port for charging low-power devices like smartwatches or Bluetooth headphones.

**Build Quality and Durability:** The build quality and durability of a notebook car charger are good indicators of lifespan. chargers constructed from high-quality materials, such as aluminum alloy or fire-resistant polycarbonate, are more likely to withstand the rigors of daily use in a car habitat.Look for chargers with robust cables and connectors that are designed to withstand repeated plugging and unplugging.Some manufacturers even offer extended warranties or guarantees, which is a reflection of their confidence in the product's durability.

## Core Benefits

The core benefits of a high-quality notebook car charger extend beyond simply replenishing battery life. They offer tangible improvements to productivity, convenience, and peace of mind.

**Uninterrupted Productivity:** A notebook car charger ensures uninterrupted productivity while traveling. Instead of watching your battery dwindle and worrying about finding an outlet, you can continue working, attending virtual meetings, or streaming content without interruption. For exmaple, a salesperson on the road can finalize a crucial presentation during their commute, knowing their notebook won't run out of power before they arrive at their destination.

Compared to standard USB chargers, a 65W or 100W PD charger can charge your notebook much faster, allowing you to quickly top up your battery during short breaks in the car. This is especially beneficial for professionals who need to maximize their time and cannot afford to wait hours for their devices to charge.

**Reduced Range Anxiety:** For electric vehicle (EV) owners, a notebook car charger can reduce range anxiety. By efficiently charging your notebook on the go, you can conserve your EV's battery power and extend its range. This allows you to travel with greater confidence, knowing that you have the power you need to both operate your notebook and reach your destination.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** While a high-quality notebook car charger may have a higher upfront cost, it proves cost-effective in the long run.

Additionally, a reliable charger protects your devices from potential damage caused by unreliable or low-quality chargers.

## FAQs Section

Answering some common questions about notebook car chargers can help clarify purchasing decisions.

**Is the notebook car charger compatible with my specific notebook model?**
Most modern notebook car chargers that support USB-PD (Power Delivery) are compatible with a wide range of notebook models. However, it's essential to check the charger's specifications and compatibility list to ensure it provides the correct voltage and amperage for your specific notebook. If your notebook requires a proprietary charging connector, you might need an adapter.Always check the voltage requirements of yor notebook too!

**What is the ideal wattage for charging my notebook in the car?**
The ideal wattage depends on your notebook's power requirements. For most standard notebooks, a 65W USB-PD charger is sufficient. For larger, power-hungry notebooks (like 15-inch or 16-inch models) or gaming laptops, a 100W charger is recommended to ensure fast and efficient charging. Using a charger with insufficient wattage may result in slower charging or the inability to charge the notebook while in use.

**Are there any safety concerns associated with using a notebook car charger?**
When using a reputable notebook car charger with built-in safety features (over-voltage protection, over-current protection, short-circuit protection, and over-temperature protection), the safety risks are minimal. Though, avoid using cheap, uncertified chargers, as they may lack these safety features and could potentially damage your devices or your car's electrical system. Ensure the charger is properly ventilated and avoid using it in extremely hot or humid conditions, as excessive heat can pose a safety risk.

**Can a notebook car charger drain my car battery?**
A notebook car charger can drain your car battery if used excessively while the engine is turned off. However, the drain is typically minimal, especially with modern chargers that are designed to be energy-efficient. To avoid draining your battery, it's best to use the charger primarily while the car's engine is running, as the alternator will replenish the battery's charge. If you need to charge your notebook while the engine is off,limit the charging time and be mindful of your car battery's charge level.

**Accuracy and Measurement Range:**

Accuracy is paramount for a coffee refractometer. top models boast accuracy levels of ¬±0.02% TDS or better, ensuring reliable readings for precise brewing adjustments. The measurement range should accommodate a wide spectrum of coffee concentrations, typically spanning from 0.00 to 30.00% TDS,allowing users to analyze everything from weak brews to concentrated extracts. High-end refractometers frequently enough incorporate automatic temperature compensation (ATC) to correct for temperature variations,further enhancing accuracy in fluctuating environments.

**Digital Display and User Interface:**

A clear and intuitive digital display is essential for easy reading of results. Many refractometers feature LCD or LED displays with backlighting for enhanced visibility in low-light conditions. A user-friendly interface simplifies operation, frequently enough incorporating one-button or multi-button controls for calibration, measurement, and mode selection. Some advanced models offer touch screen displays for seamless navigation and a more streamlined user experience.

**Calibration and Zeroing:**

Accurate calibration is critical for reliable TDS measurements. Moast digital coffee refractometers require calibration with distilled water to establish a zero point. The calibration process should be straightforward, typically involving the application of a small amount of distilled water to the prism and subsequent adjustment according to the manufacturer's instructions. Some refractometers feature automatic calibration functions, further simplifying the process and minimizing user error.

**Durability and Portability:**

A coffee refractometer should be durable enough to withstand the rigors of daily use in a coffee shop or home brewing habitat. Look for models with robust housings made from materials like ABS plastic or metal. Portability is also an vital consideration, especially for professionals who need to travel to different locations. Compact and lightweight designs make it easy to transport the refractometer in a bag or case. Moreover, water resistance (IP ratings) are desirable for durability and cleaning purposes.

**Data logging and Connectivity:**

Some advanced coffee refractometers offer data logging capabilities, allowing users to store and track TDS measurements over time. This feature is especially useful for monitoring brewing consistency and identifying trends. Connectivity options, such as Bluetooth or USB, enable users to transfer data to computers or mobile devices for further analysis and reporting. These features enable baristas to precisely control and optimize their processes.

## Core benefits

Using a coffee refractometer offers notable benefits for both professional and home brewers.

**Improved Consistency:** A refractometer allows users to objectively measure coffee strength, eliminating guesswork and ensuring consistent results.By tracking TDS readings and extraction yields, brewers can identify optimal brewing parameters and replicate them consistently, leading to better and more predictable coffee quality. This consistency directly translates to customer satisfaction in a commercial setting.

**Optimized Extraction:** the extraction yield, derived from TDS measurements, provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the brewing process. by monitoring extraction, brewers can fine-tune their grind size, dose, and brewing time to achieve optimal extraction, maximizing flavor potential and minimizing undesirable characteristics like bitterness or sourness. Using a refractometer enables the precise creation of coffee that meets, or exceeds, expectations.

**Reduced Waste:** By accurately measuring coffee strength and extraction, a refractometer can help reduce waste by preventing over-extraction or under-extraction. This is particularly critically important in a commercial setting, where minimizing waste can considerably impact profitability. Accurate measurements can inform adjustments that enable efficient use of coffee beans and produce repeatable, desirable results.

**Enhanced Quality Control:** Coffee refractometers are invaluable tools for quality control in coffee shops and roasting facilities. They enable professionals to monitor the quality of their coffee at various stages of the brewing process, ensuring that it meets established standards and consistently delivers a superior experience. The ability to consistently assess and verify extraction levels dramatically simplifies daily quality control.

## FAQs Section

**How frequently enough should I calibrate my coffee refractometer?**
It is indeed recommended to calibrate your coffee refractometer before each brewing session or at least once per day for regular usage. Calibration ensures accuracy and reliable readings.Digital refractometers often prompt calibration if they detect significant drift or variance from previous settings.

**Can I use a coffee refractometer for other beverages besides coffee?**
While primarily designed for measuring coffee TDS,a refractometer can possibly be used for other beverages with dissolved solids such as tea,juice,or other brewing extracts. However, it's essential to consider the specific gravity range of the instrument and whether the dissolved substances interfere with accurate measurement. Make sure to clean it thoroughly before and after use with different liquids to avoid misreadings.

**What is the ideal TDS range for brewed coffee?**
The ideal TDS range for brewed coffee typically falls between 1.15% and 1.35%, depending on the brewing method and personal preference.This range is generally considered to provide a balanced and flavorful cup of coffee. However, experimentation is encouraged to find the TDS level that best suits your taste.

For context, I‚Äôm 37F diagnosed with an ASD and ADHD combo that for some reason excludes me from ADHD meds where I‚Äôm from. (I know from experience that many ADHD meds work well on me. Alas.)

I‚Äôve been trying to address my executive functioning, attention and social anxiety issues with ‚Äúsupplementation‚Äù for a long while. 

Current ‚ÄúStack‚Äù (hehe):

Morning: L-Tyrosine 500mg, 5-MTHF 1000mcg, B12, B1, D3, Lions Mane 1350mcg, Omega-3 1250mg, Coffee

Afternoon Smoothie: Collagen, Creatine, Protein, Caffeine, Taurine. 

Evening: Magnesium 200mg, L-Theanine 225mg

Sometimes snacks: Chocolate, Low Dose Testosterone Gel (I‚Äôm genderqueer and I like the energy and libido boost), Cannabis, Phenebut. (Phenebut is a recent addition and the reason I found myself here, and while it completely eliminated my social anxiety, will be an occasional, at-parties only experience.)

I also experience PMDD before my period begins. It‚Äôs a kind of extreme PMS that is common in neurodivergent folks and leads to extreme anxiety and depression. For that I have discovered the use of antihistamines, namely Pepcid AC. It‚Äôs incredible how well it works as an off-label treatment and it‚Äôs use is growing. 

After poking around this sub a bit I‚Äôm considering trying a few new things, including:

Modafinil
Bromantane
GB-115

I have access to Modafinil so I was gonna try that first, but I read that it effects histamine levels and that‚Äôs made me wary. My PMDD can get really bad, like, suicidally bad, and I don‚Äôt want to mess with that. 

A lot of the experiences on here seems to be from more male-form and hormonally profiled people, so I thought I‚Äôd ask specifically for more female-form experiences?

Does anyone have experiences with Modafinil and PMS/PMDD? Did it impact your emotional and hormonal wellbeing?

(Also open to general ‚ÄúStack‚Äù advice and recommendations for what to try next!)

Thanks :)

She‚Äôs going through phases of complaining about him coming over to myself, my partner and another friend of hers who visits every couple of weeks. But if there‚Äôs days where he can‚Äôt come over for whatever reason, she gets upset.

About a month or so ago, I was working from home and noticed him trying to help her with something, where she snapped at him and told him to leave things alone. He went along with it and listened to what she said and I sat back without saying anything thinking that she was really nasty towards him, and continued to be quite nasty most of that morning. 

Me and my partner use the time he comes and visits as a bit of respite to go out and run errands or do some work for our business, so we don‚Äôt see how often this behaviour is, and that particular day I thought it was a one off.

Though all last week my grandma was saying she needed something, but couldn‚Äôt think what it was. I tried everything I could from simulating things, trying to generate the word for the product, the motion of how you use it, and actually bringing physical objects to show her, but she really couldn‚Äôt think.

Yesterday morning, I heard her fuming to him about me not getting it for her. So I went in and asked her again what it was, trying to guess various items. She was becoming really aggressive towards me, and every time her friend tried to guess, she was really angrily telling him to ‚Äúshut up,‚Äù where I would snap back at her saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be nasty.‚Äù

We still don‚Äôt know what it was she was after.

I know dementia has took over, and this aggression isn‚Äôt my grandma herself, and that a lot of it is her frustration because she can‚Äôt get out what she wants to. And I wish I could help her the best I can but we got absolutely nowhere with this one. 

But it also keeps playing on my mind. And perhaps it‚Äôs my own fault for taking all of this personally but it‚Äôs hard not to as many on here will understand. I keep thinking maybe I should have put my foot down more and told her off more for the way she was talking to him? But then equally she probably wouldn‚Äôt have understood what I was saying anyway. 

I apologised to him when he was going back home later on, and he put on a brave face and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm used to it.‚Äù And I just reminded him it‚Äôs not her, it‚Äôs her dementia and he nodded and agreed.

About a month after his death in January, I was getting a few things at the CVS by my mom‚Äôs house. I noticed that they had stopped playing Christmas music and had some awful 70‚Äôs soundtrack on. All of sudden the sound track stopped and this ad came on, ‚ÄúAloha Hawaii customers‚Ä¶.‚Äù It went on to talk about Longs drugs which is what they call CVS on the Big Island where we were last year. It ended with ‚ÄúMahalo and enjoy your day in paradise.‚Äù Then the 70s music cut back in. I have been to CVS before and since then and have never heard a Longs Drugs Hawaiian ad until that time.

About a month ago,I met my boss for coffee and drove a new way to stop at a clothing outlet. I got stopped at a light that had an entrance to a campground called KOA. The car stopped in front of me was a Hyundai Kona. So‚Ä¶.Kona is the airport on the Big island and KOA is the airport code.

I started to have doubt when, besides also staying out late relatively frequently, she would never let anyone attend appointments with her, and she clearly had way too much energy for someone going through aggressive chemotherapy.

Last week, I ran into the office manager of my sister's oncologist at a coffee shop (small town). I casually mentioned my sister, and the office manager was confused; she had no idea who I was talking about. I did some digging through doctors and spoke to my sister about what I learned and she broke down and spilled her guts.

It turns out she fabricated the whole story because she was in over her head with debt and wasn't able to afford her apartment anymore. The cancer story got our parents to move in and she could then stop paying her bills.

I was furious and told her that she had 24 hours to tell our parents the truth or I would. She asked me not to tell them because it would ruin her relationship with them. She did not tell them, so yesterday I took everything to our parents.

Our parents are heartbroken. My sister is acting like I had no right to ""out"" her and she didn't even say this to our parents, she was going to stage a ""miraculous recovery"" next month. She said I ruined her life, and that family should be trying to defend each other rather than expose each other.",630,1748097430.0,AmItheAsshole,110,0.9,False
1kud3pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kud3pc/one_that_got_away_is_it_too_late_me_33m_and_girl/,One that got away? Is it too late? Me (33M) and girl (29F),"Where to start,
During my twenties I (33M) was in a long term relationship with my college girlfriend (33F), I was juggling multiple jobs, university and trying to make the relationship work.

One of my jobs was retail work, just so I had secure hours at the time, anyway throughout my years there I became quite close to a girl (29F) who was working in a different department, she was always in relationships with the wrong person, we would always talk openly, about anything and it wouldn‚Äôt get spread to anyone else in the store, we would always giggle, both bonded on random similarities ( both had an African grey parrot for instance growing up), and both talked about the latest horror films coming out, and things we liked, we had this weird instant connection no judgement, like this safe space bubble.

She eventually became involved with her higher up she worked with, for context me and my college girlfriend had been together 3 years then both did university long distance for 3 years then rush moved in together when she came back. Anyway I was now living with my college girlfriend and trying to make that work, my retail friend was trying to make it work with the higher up guy ( in his 30s, has 2 kids and dosent want anymore) she always wanted a future with kids and sort of became a stepmom and was trying to make it work with him. 
 
We would both talk about our situations, how it was going, I would give advise saying your not going to start a family with him and not going to be happy in the end as your not getting what you want, eventually they would separate.

During this period everything went dark for me. My parents separated, me and my college girlfriend broke up, she realised we was basically 2 flat mates living together, the romance was dead for a long time, I moved in with my dad, I mourned the loss and carried on. My grandma then passed, the family dog too, then I got diagnosed with cancer. I got through it all I went back to work I carried on, but I was broken mentally. 

During this period work place friend was still there I think in and out of relationships, but we was still the same she would still comfort me and would check I was okay. Then another younger colleague (24F) I mostly didn‚Äôt know existed or spoke to, could see my pain as she had been through deep trauma herself, she started to talk, she bought me chocolates everyday, gave me hugs in the break room when I was struggling, we went on walks together and became a thing, she was helping me cope and making me feel alive again after all my darkness.

This really quickly began to blow up real quick in the work setting. I was now involved with the younger work gf, she became jealous of me and my friends talks, my friend wasn‚Äôt willing to stop talking to me as she really valued our time and connection.
Around this time me and younger work gf where having problems I became suspicious of her. Me and my friend would talk a lot on messenger, I became very confused
We both realised we might actually have feelings for each other, I was with the younger gf, my friend told me she thought the world of me and that she understands it‚Äôs awkward but she told my younger work gf she wasn‚Äôt good enough for me and I deserved better, which basically turned nasty.

There then was work meetings, and we were all told to stop otherwise it would be taken further. I wasn‚Äôt willing to cheat or end it with younger gf at the time for my friend because it felt wrong, my friend started dating again, tensions continued to get worse, me and my younger work gf then left that job, I didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye to my work friend, we then moved in together, settled, got different jobs and tried to make it work. Fast forward 3 years, I tried everything to make it work with her, I realised she wanted me to change and be someone I wasn‚Äôt, I stopped doing the things I enjoyed, abandoned my friends and family, everything was a constant pressure from her when are you going to change your job, when are we getting married etc. I thought about my friend from time to time what I had given up on. Anyway our problems got worse and eventually one night I came home and she was upset I tried to reason and say I have her dads permission for us to get married, she then left for 4 nights cheated on me and it was over, we are now in the process of moving out, I‚Äôm getting my own place and have realised how much better things will be without her, I‚Äôm reaching out to the friends and family I abandoned, and trying to get into contact with my original work friend again as I regret how I felt forced to walk away from it and always wondered in the back of my mind.

There was also things I didn‚Äôt read into along the way, when she was with the higher up work guy I always said she should try horror games on Xbox she‚Äôd probably enjoy them and could play them with him, little did I know she bought one to play with me but I didn‚Äôt get the hint. she said the higher up guy always thought me and her was too close even though we didn‚Äôt text or do anything outside of work at the time. 

One time me and younger work gf was getting a coffee in town and the bartender was like hello how you doing the family talk about you a lot, I didn‚Äôt know this person, back then I found out it was my friends sister later on, and that throughout our whole friendship i was discussed at home with her parents like ‚Äúoh he thinks me and higher guy won‚Äôt work etc‚Äù.

So now I‚Äôm trying to figure out my life, what I want to do, do I want to move away, trying to reconnect with friends and family I abandoned, and also get clarity on unresolved things like my work friend, I‚Äôve found out where she works, have reached out, and am hoping to say I‚Äôm sorry for walking away from our connection she was right about younger gf all along, that I hope she is happy, in a better place now, I also want to say she doesn‚Äôt have to acknowledge it, be friends or anything, just so I can get it off my chest and carry on instead of wondering.

**Vultiss, Arxur, head of M.V.P.O., somewhere in Wriss sector, New Terran Calendar 01-Huitzilopochtli-36 (Old Human Calendar: 7 October 2048)**

‚ÄúThe chief huntress has been held up momentarily, she will be with you soon, Sir‚Äù says the attendant before leaving me alone in my old friend‚Äôs quarters.   
I look around, taking in the particulars of the room, the new and the old. On one wall, a screen reproduces the space outside, on the opposite side of the room, an old painting, that I haven‚Äôt seen before, of [a human woman with a mysterious look and a tiny predator in her arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_with_an_Ermine). In front of the painting lies an old wooden desk with two photos on top, one of Elena and her late husband, the other of her with her daughter at the Altiss canyons on Wriss. In the middle of the room, there are two comfortable leather couches, and between them, on an ancient-looking carpet, sleeps a shadestalker, its head resting on a Venlil chew toy.

‚ÄúVultiss, long time no see, what dragged your tail here all the way from the capital?‚Äù¬†

I turn around, and there she is, staring me down from maw to tail.

‚ÄúElena! I‚Äôm sorry for imposing my presence, but we have matters to discuss, that are better done in person‚Äù I hiss, with a hint of nervousness. She is definitely not going to appreciate much of what I am here to discuss.

She gestures me to the desk, and I sit on the Arxur-adapted one. *Let‚Äôs start with the easy one*, I think.  
‚ÄúA couple of days ago, a Ghost team raided a prey lab where we believed they were testing chemical weapons, and they made some disconcerting discoveries‚Äù I growl. I send the mission report to her pad. She undoes the top buttons of her military jacket and starts reading, tilting her head, exposing an old burn mark on her neck. For a second, I catch a glimpse of the burnt hatchling I saved from the exterminators thirty-six years before.

‚ÄúSo they kidnapped a German soldier from WWII. I must admit, it's probably the best plan that those animals ever came up with. Do we know who this German Rip van Winkle was?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, if you go to page thirty-nine, we included the biographical data we were able to find from the old archives of a middle eastern country for some reason. I think it was called Israel‚Äù I conclude perplexed,

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually less surprising than you think it is‚Äù she says pensive, her eyes running over the text.¬†

‚ÄúSo, he was part of the German chemical weapons program and they wanted to use him for his knowledge. Because of course they were. They can‚Äôt innovate, so they scavenge.‚Äù She snarls then she stares at me ‚ÄúYou guys still have that back channel to Underscales, don‚Äôt you? You should send over a warning along with some information about possible antidotes‚Äù she concludes.

‚ÄúIs it really necessary? They definitely have the technology to deal with the problem alone‚Äù I hiss with a bit of annoyance.

‚ÄúDiplomatic relations are already difficult as it is. The last thing we want is for the feds to start using something like sarin or tabun, and the Resket think we have something to do about it‚Äù she says with a hint of exasperation in her voice,

‚ÄúThat bad? What‚Äòs the hurdle now?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe refused once again to sell them the technology for stealth ships‚Äù, she scoffs raising her eyes to the ceiling,

‚ÄúSooner or later, they are going to crack it anyway‚Äù I hiss with the same annoyance,

‚ÄúLater would be the best, we both know that the feds are a temporary enemy, and after they crumble, we will end up in a struggle for hegemony with the Consortium. And we will be the weaker side, *sure*, we have a stronger military, but they are more technologically advanced and they are simply *well* more. And as an old friend used to say: demography is destiny‚Äù,

‚ÄúThe Jaslip refugee program is helping on both angles, but they‚Äôre getting wiser to it‚Äù I growl,

‚ÄúYes, they would‚Äôve closed that tap if the prey hadn‚Äôt stoked all that xenophobia on their other planets, making it political suicide‚Äù, with a snarl she adds: ‚ÄúHonestly, I would like to shake the paw of the idiotic squid that started this war, they couln‚Äôt have made us a better gift‚Äù, we exchange a predatory look and I growl ferociusly: ‚ÄúBoth of our rivals grinding each other down‚Äù.  
Then, a chime interrupts us. She glances at her pad and lets her attendant in with a touch. He enters, leaves a cup of coffee for her and a glass of bone broth for me, before quickly leaving.

I take a sip and continue: ‚ÄúAnyway, before leaving the lab, the operatives managed to draw a vial of blood. And I think, if you look at the preliminary results, you‚Äôll find them most interesting‚Äù, I quikly send her the file, she takes a quick look before locking her gaze on me.   
‚Äú*Wow*, that‚Äôs a significant predisposition to the second sight. Sure, he probably didn‚Äôt know like, *well*, everybody at the time‚Ä¶ so they are experimenting on the second sight as well‚Äù her voice sharp as a blade.‚ÄúLooks like it‚Ä¶the ghosts managed to take a Farsul scientist. *We‚Äôll make it talk*‚Äù,

‚ÄúGood, \[she sneers\], give me a heads up if it sings about the others‚Äù,

‚ÄúThe others?‚Äù I ask quizzically,

‚ÄúI never heard of an experiment with only one specimen, do you? And I bet we aren‚Äôt the only ones, after all, how could they have created the meat allergy otherwise?‚Äù.  
My pupils flip from one side to the other, analysing what she had just said and low growl filled with rage escapes my maw. I cross her eyes and I see the same vengeful look reflected on her face. The hatchling had grown, indeed.

In an attempt to steady myself, I am once again drawn to the painting behind her back. She follows my look and ‚ÄúAh, the Lady with an Ermine, or well a rather good copy of it anyway. The original is on Earth, in a museum. We got lucky with that one, it was being restored when the Feds showed up. So, It didn't go destroyed along with Krakow‚Äù.   
While she sips her coffee, I turn my head to the side and say perplexed: ‚ÄúI never considered you someone with a taste for art‚Äù.   
She starts laughing and goes: ‚ÄúOver thirty years and you still know so little about me. I was studying to become a conservator when the vermin showed up‚Äù, then she looks at me more seriously, calculating, and continues: ‚ÄúBut you haven‚Äôt come here to talk about a dog scientist with a miserable future ahead or art. So, why don‚Äôt you start telling me what‚Äôs really about, that is making your tail twitch like a Venlil‚Äù.

I hiss miserably, and with a swift gesture, I send her the New Aurora‚Äôs files. She starts reading them with increasing attention, after a few minutes that feel like years, she looks at me with a very cold look of barely contained rage.¬†

‚ÄúSo, It was just a lucky Venlil that killed my husband, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù she growls furiously,

‚ÄúI admit we were wrong with that one‚Äù,

‚ÄúAnd now you are going to tell me that you can‚Äôt give me the Gojid, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù,

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm sorry and also‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd also WHAT?‚Äù she interrupts me,

‚ÄúWe need to access the ghost ships' files to find the breach‚Äù,

‚ÄúYou know perfectly well why those files are out of your jurisdiction‚Äù,

‚ÄúThere is no other way to check. And if that porcupine was involved in your husband‚Äôs murder, it can‚Äôt be an exterminator stranded on Earth since the Fall.‚Äù

She stares at the ceiling for a long moment before: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll grant access to one of yours, and I will put at their side one of mine to watch them like a hawk. If I have the slightest inkling that they are looking into something else‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll pull the carpet out from under my claws‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGlad that we reached an understanding, and Vultiss?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I hiss,

‚ÄúWhen this story is over, the gojid‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs yours‚Äù *and it‚Äôs going to be one sorry fucker when it happens*, I add to myself.

I‚Äôve been having trouble dialing in any espresso bean on my Bambino Plus for several months now. I was previously using an OXO grinder, and like many of you told me, I know it‚Äôs not ideal for espresso. So I finally upgraded‚Äîmy DF54 (Turin) just arrived yesterday.

That said‚Ä¶ the shots still taste extremely sour or bitter. No matter what I do, I just can‚Äôt seem to get it right‚Äîand I‚Äôm hoping this community can help me one more time.

Dial-in process so far:

-Using a 1:2 ratio (18g in, 36g out)

-Started at grind setting 20, worked down to 15

-Taste hasn‚Äôt changed much‚Äîstill sour or bitter

-Already used half the bag trying to figure it out

I genuinely love coffee‚Äîblack or with creamer, doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôve had espresso at restaurants before, but never paid close attention to taste. A friend recently recommended a local coffee shop, and I think it‚Äôs time I go and try a real, well-pulled shot. That will at least help me answer:

1.	Does espresso just taste like this and it‚Äôs my palate?

2.	Or‚Ä¶ oh damn, this is amazing‚Äîwhy can‚Äôt I replicate this at home?

Honestly, I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs the second. Otherwise, this whole journey has started to feel like a waste.

Current setup:

-Breville Bambino Plus (with single-wall double shot basket)

-DF54 (Turin) grinder ‚Äì just unboxed

-Atlas Coffee Club espresso beans ‚Äì delivered yesterday, says ‚Äúroasted to order‚Äù but no visible roast date

My process:
1.	Weigh 18g of beans
2.	Grind
3.	WDT
4.	Distribute & level
5.	Tamp firmly
6.	Pull shot

The puck looks great. It‚Äôs just the flavor that‚Äôs not landing.

If anyone out there has this exact setup (especially with these beans), could you please share your exact dial-in settings as a starting point? I know everyone‚Äôs gear and water are a little different, but maybe it‚Äôll help me realize if I‚Äôm way off base.

Thanks in advance, really appreciate any help or  advice!",3,1748097387.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

My sleep is messed up so if you're wanting soneone to chat all night and day with that's me.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. Currently playing Doom The Dark Ages

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Hmm how I would describe myself? Black hair. Beard. Brown eyes. Dad Bod. Hairy. I've been told I had nice eye lashes. I'm cultivating mass to destroy my enemies in battle at the buffet line. 

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.

Pretty much looking for some fun and maybe make a friend in the process. I like to think I'm a decent conversationalist but who knows. Not sure if this is enticing so far.

I am willing to do the swap pics and all that.

It all started in the beginning of 2023 when I was not the healthiest. I don‚Äôt know if it has anything to do with it but I vaped for 2 years before this and drank a lot of caffeine. I worked out a lot at the gym and lifted weights Regularly. One day in March of 2023 I woke up with the scariest panic attack of my life I thought I was dying at first and I ran to my mom and she reassured me and said it was just anxiety and it eventually subsided without need to go to a hospital.
I proceeded the next days vaping as I normally did but it started to make me shaky and not breath when it hasn‚Äôt before. I quit vaping and started chewing nicotine gum. Same with caffeine. I used to drink coffee in the morning, pre workout, and two energy drinks every day and not be affected. Now I can barely drink a half calf coffee pod without spazzing out and I fully quit nicotine but I still feel all my symptoms.

Air hunger. It will come on randomly. Mainly when I leave my house I can‚Äôt catch a breath when I‚Äôm in my car, at my bfs house, at school. This then leads to dizziness that I‚Äôm not getting enough oxygen and I start to freak out and flee any situation I‚Äôm in.
Dizziness. It happens along with the air hunger or sometimes I will be sitting and my heart makes a weird thump and I look all the breathe in my lungs and then I‚Äôm fine after 10 seconds.
Sensitivity to light. This mainly happens when I‚Äôm out and about at like a grocery store. I feel like I can barely open my eyes.
Internal shaking. You can‚Äôt see the shaking if I were to put my hand out. This happens the worst when I‚Äôm really tired during the day and want to take a mid day nap. But when I try I feel like I never make it asleep and I‚Äôm all shaky in my chest area. This feeling sometimes happens in the morning when I wake up from sleeping through the night
Chest pressure. I sometimes feel this when I wake up accompanied by the shaking in the morning.
I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy and I don‚Äôt see a doctor for another two months and I been struggling with this for two years and have tried to cut out alot of stuff but it‚Äôs not going away.

I‚Äôve been eating keto for only 5 days (but not a newbie‚Ä¶ been on a keto diet too many times and fallen off too many times, but did have long term success a couple years ago, anyhow‚Ä¶). 

My fiance woke me up this morning with my previous (regular eating) Starbucks order, which is egg bites & a grande lavender oat milk latte. 

The egg bites aren‚Äôt so bad (5g net carb), so I ate them. But the lavender oat milk latte is 37 carbs!!! 

I couldn‚Äôt stomach pouring the whole thing down the drain ($7 coffee lol), so I drank half and kindly told my fiance my new & improved Starbucks order (tall almond milk latte with 1 Splenda). 

Did I do the right thing? Should I have just wasted it? My plan is to eat almost 0 carbs the rest of the day to balance it out. 

Previous times I was keto I killed myself over perfection and it often led to a binge session. Just curious what you guys would have done differently. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt my fianc√©s feelings for his super kind gesture, or waste his money.

On paper, probably the best you I can do, pretty and full of love. She is from Latin America, and I am from Europe, the original plan was that she starts to study here (the language) and stays on a visa with me for 6 months. During that time, she would move in. When she mentioned to me the news that she might have found a school and the plan would come true, I felt pressured and anxious instead of excited.   
I already saw this coming after March, when she visited me for 2.5 months. The first two weeks were fine but the more time she spent with me the more, I lacked my own space. She is super respectful, so when I communicated that to her, she tried to give it to me. We both work from home and then she went 2-3 times to a coffee shop to work. However, that almost made it worse for me, I dont want her to do that just to do me a favor -- I was amazed that for her, it was no issue at all to spent all time with me. I swear she had no desire to do anything on her own, I even had to baby sit her to the supermarket. Anyway, she says the next time, it will be different because she will study etc. but I just feel like a ""baby-sitter"" with her. I don‚Äôt feel like it's a relationship where we both on the same playing field, but rather me taking care of here -- and she follows me.

Full context: I use a heavily modded LP Pro and have gradually learned to achieve results I find much tastier than 98% of the cafes I visit, likely because I've come to prefer very light roast coffees (Wendelboe, Sey, some Onyx, etc.).

I typically keep dose consistent (15g) and dial in by grind (Sculptor 64s, stock burrs, slow feed), temperature, preinfusion (boiler pressure and/or add'l 2 bar PI), and water-debit/shot-volume (mini-Felini, etc.). I've winnowed down my puck prep to blind shaker onto bottom paper filter, stiff sprung double tamp, plus puck screen. I have a refractometer so I've confirmed my EY% a time or two but don't use it regularly - I'm just shooting for what tastes the best to me. I am now keenly aware this is sounding like an r/espressocirclejerk post.

I bought a high flow Normcore basket awhile back and have only tried it a couple times, definitely not giving it a fair shake yet, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort.

Rolling over I find you. My approach is simple. My forehead on your back. I listen. I inhale. I only seek the comfort of your existence. 

You need rest. I slide from the covers, folded sheets fossiled on my sleepy face. Doggies need breakfast. And skritches. The house needs its morning welcome. Coffee must begin its happy percolation. 

Back to you. In the only grayness I celebrate. Sleepy Saturday morning rainfall. The coccoon of millions of drops on every surface and their friendly, rhythmic call that I must stay inside and let my mind be clear. 

Carefully back under the covers that still hold my warmth. This time I seek all of you. That embrace where toes and legs and hips and shoulders each find their lover. My arms surround you. My face welcomed into hair softer than a box of kittens. A cascade of countless microshifts and my body has nestled into its home. 

And then you make a sound. A blissful moan. Happiness unencumbered by thought or word. It echoes through my body with its ancient magic of healing and joy. 

But my mind is working. What whispers does she need?  What thought can I offer as her magnificent mind begins to ignite on this gentle, blessed morning?  What words would best introduce her to this day?

Skin to skin synapses sparkle warmly. She stirs. Her own micro-wiggles. Another little moan, somewhat intentional. She is awake. 

I carefully kiss the side of her neck. I feel her happy sigh as she realizes the moment she is in. 

I whisper: ‚ÄúYou are such a lovely, beautiful person. I am so grateful for you.‚Äù

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/7RvWaTseiH)  **Dec 9th, 2024**

I (29 F) have this friend (30 F) who booked their wedding date 6 days before ours. For background, his boyfriend, I and my fiance went to the same university. We're not that close but fast forward, the 4 of us are currently working abroad and became close over the span of 2 years. Close friends as in we were together for almost every week for that period. My fiance and I got engaged last June and we booked the date, venue and other major suppliers on the same month. We immediately told our friend group about the date so that they can plot it in their calendar ahead of time. I have been sharing every detail to this close friend of mine since she already appointed herself as one of my bridesmaids (which I really intend to). Then 4 months after, this close friend of mine got engaged which I'm obviously happy with until she told me a month ago that they picked a date which is 6 DAYS BEFORE OURS. 

I was so shocked because it seems like she didn't consider the people around her. We have common friends who will both be attending on our wedding and both of our wedding will be held at the same city, 4 hours away from the metro. I immediately told her that I might not be on her wedding since for sure I'll be busy a week before my wedding since I have no coordinator. I live abroad & will held our wedding in our home country which I only took a work leave for 3 weeks max. There's a lot to do for last minute preparations. After telling her that, she replied to me ""It's okay I understand"" then goes out to my room as if the info she told me is only an ""FYI"" which hurts me a little more because she doesn't care if I'll be at her wedding or not. She's in my bridesmaids list but I'm planning to remove her due to this.

I didn't talk to her about this but I've been hurting since then. At the end of the day, its not within my control. She can pick any date she wants but I just hope she considered me in any way. So AITA for having this feeling? What should I do? How can I tell her about removing her on my list without getting into these details? I played in my mind what if I open up my feelings to her but I think she'll play the victim or as if I'm overreacting. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/ltQ9pGdcig)  **May 17th, 2025**

UPDATE: AITA for wanting to cut off my close friend after she booked their wedding 6 days before mine?

Hello! Just wanted to give an update. Thank you for all the insights regarding my previous post. 

So at first, I didn‚Äôt cutoff my ‚Äúclose friend‚Äù because I‚Äôm trying my best to remind myself that this is their wedding, not mine so I have no control over it. But something definitely changed between us, I know she knows it too. 

Few months later, her fiance messaged & asked my fiance to be his groomsman. He even requested for my fiance to allot at least 2-3 days of his time to prepare as a groomsman. My blood boiled, they set their wedding 6 days before ours then he had the audacity to ask for the prep days? Take note, that‚Äôs for the role of an entourage, so they knew that a groom needs maybe more than 6 days to prep for his own wedding. My fiance politely declined and explained that we have things to polish days before our wedding since we have no coordinator and we have a lot of things to do - last minute prep. 

This girl also asked me about being a bridesmaid but I politely declined as well. She lowkey asked me if they‚Äôre still invited but indirectly told her that we will remove them on our list and we‚Äôre considering that they‚Äôre on their honeymoon anyways. I was furious again on how inconsiderate they are so I decided to talk to her to open up about how I felt. 

So we went for a coffee and talked about the issue. None of us said sorry. She told me that if she was in my shoes, she wouldn‚Äôt feel mad about what they did. She feels like based on my personality, I was just too emotional as a person that‚Äôs why I took it the way I did. She really wishes me to be part of her entourage & thought that 6 days is enough. I told her it‚Äôs easier to think that when your wedding is on the first few days of the week and not on the latter. His fiance even asked 3 days for prep as a groosman so they know that a groom needs to prep more than 6 days especially if there‚Äôs last minute things that we need to handle.

After the talk, I realized that our EQ weren‚Äôt just the same because I would never be so inconsiderate to a close friend of mine. We‚Äôre not going to each other‚Äôs wedding but we‚Äôll support each other as a bride. I recommended suppliers that she still needs and she does the same. After that talk, I took a step back to our friendship and went back to being an acquaintance. I never had a friend like that, I focused on my true friends but somehow I still feel bad about it.

***Added Comments***

*OP added this in the comments*

>It‚Äôs really an unfortunate event, what‚Äôs most sad about it is it affected how I viewed the wedding planning phase. My enthusiasm to it really skyrocketed down and I feel really bad to my fiance. I always see this couple since we‚Äôre in a small group of friends working abroad but we‚Äôre slowly starting to set some boundaries like not inviting them to my bday since I don‚Äôt feel good whenever I see them. My fiance is very protective of me and very objective to this issue. He already told me before not to get too close with this girl because he feels like she‚Äôs always prioritizing herself without consideration on the people around her (there are some instances before) but I even fought him about his view to her. Our other friends doesn‚Äôt know about this issue and I felt like it will be awkward when we send the invites & they‚Äôll know that this couple isn‚Äôt invited. I don‚Äôt want to retell the story anymore.

*did OPs friend know her wedding date beforehand*

>They knew our date even before they got engaged. She told me she set that date so that our friends are in our home country on the same month. I told her why does it have to be on the same week? she told me she had no other choice. I couldn‚Äôt argue much about it coz I really don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true.

1kucle3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kucle3/how_do_i_help_my_brother_leave_his_abusive_racist/,How do I help my brother leave his abusive & racist wife safely?,"TLDR: My brother (43, Black) is has been physically and emotionally abused by his racist wife (39,White). I need help trying to document the abuse for legal purposes and how to safely push him to wake up and leave.

My older brother being abused physically emotionally & even mentally by his wife. This has been a suspicion for many years from our family but it was recently confirmed. For some context his wife is diagnosed with bipolar disorder for the which she (inconsistently) takes medication. In the past she has displayed volatile & extreme possessive behavior. Volatile behavior includes slamming the door shut on his hands in a fit of rage breaking one of his fingers, throwing things at him, screaming expletives at him. Extreme possessive behavior includes isolating him from his family (we found out she blocked my mother‚Äôs number in his cell phone without his knowledge), always having to be with him when he visits us, trying to control my nephew/ his son (not her bio). Always grounding nephew or yelling or small things, all while my brother allows the behavior. She‚Äôs a really erratic person, even in her happy times she‚Äôs talks 100mph & constantly repeatedly cuts you off mid sentence during convo.

To elaborate on my brother & why he allows this behavior, he is a really timid soft spoken man. He has a giant heart and his kindness can be his weakness. He also has always had a gullible type of personality, which is susceptible to people with aggressive personality being able to manipulate him easily. As much as I hate to talk down on my brother, the truth is he‚Äôs always been a pushover that me and my siblings have had to intervene.

Now the current situation, my brother (44) is Black & his wife is White. She has four previous bio children (22M, 20F, 17M, 13F) but she has one bio child with my brother (7M) My nephew just turned 18 a few months back, and ever since she‚Äôs been trying to control him even more which has been met with resistance. As we expected for many years due to her control issues. His father finally stood up for him & told her he‚Äôs an adult now. She went on a rampage and told him and my nephew to leave. It was 2am in the morning.

She started to throw household items like the toaster and coffee mugs at him. Her daughter (13,F) started to do the same. Their 7,M biological son together began to join in. My nephew called my mother who called them an uber. WHY they didn‚Äôt call police is beyond me but that‚Äôs another story (all of this information was relayed to me from my nephew and my mother after the fact, I live across the country in Nevada).

When he was about to leave she began to hurl racist expletives at them both. ‚ÄúLeave and never come back you Black N hard er‚Äù to my brother, ‚Äúfk you & your black cunt girlfriend‚Äù my nephew as he was sending his girlfriend video evidence as backup in case she broke his phone as she kept lunging at him while he recorded the rant. The disturbing sick part is that my mother said his little brother, my brothers biological son, said she heard him screaming ‚ÄúGET OUT OF HERE N word HARD ERRRRRRRRR‚Äù repeatedly. He‚Äôs half black, this is his father and brother he‚Äôs saying this to. My mother heard the 20, F stepsister telling my nephew ‚Äúyeah you are a hard er‚Äù when he was initially telling her what they were saying. So we have to assume this has been an ongoing thing. My brother has been dealing with subtle and/or aggressive racism in his own home from his own family.

Once he got the house he broke down and told of all the abuse that had been happening. Her threatening to hurt herself if he ever leaves, which makes him believe she will hurt him as well. The physical abuse with throwing items and hitting him with open hand. Yelling and screaming insults. He seemed like he was finally to point of divorcing and leaving. The next day she sent a long message of how she didn‚Äôt mean it and to come home. He returned the next day. You can imagine our heartbreak.

The 17, M is the only one that showed compassion and remorse for the situation. Well the 22M no longer keeps in contact he distanced as soon as turn 18. But the 17 brother went to visit and let know they were all wrong to attack them and he doesn‚Äôt feel that way. I assume that‚Äôs due to them always being so close in age and hanging out the most. We have never been able to develop a close relationship with our bio 7yo nephew because again she‚Äôs so controlling we never had the chance. So he‚Äôs never been around his Black family much at all. It breaks my heart to know that his mother and family is possibly teaching him to hate half of himself. Even worse is that he has no respect at all for his father. In fact, anytime he disciplines his son he gets undermined by her. When she gets home from work 7M immediately tells whatever dad didn‚Äôt let him do or reprimanded.

We always would say that my 18Y nephew would grow up to not have any respect for his father for the way he let his wife treat him s without ever standing up for him or putting an end to it. Now that day has come. He chose to stay with his grandmother (my mom) for the rest of his senior year. When he graduated school he reluctantly invited his dad which was only due to us begging him to allow it. His dad wanted to be apart of the special day. We said there‚Äôs no way he would dare bring her to the graduation, he did. My sister contained her anger to avoid ruining my nephew big day or causing a scene. But this was the last straw. She really had the nerve to show up to his graduation uninvited because of course he wasn‚Äôt going to attend his son‚Äôs graduation without her.

I have been brainstorming the best way to go about this. I understand it‚Äôs not easy to convince someone in a domestic violence relationship to leave, but I need help on how to do this. The first thing I told my family is if ANYTHING else happens they need to immediately call police. We need to start creating a documented history of the abuse, but we also need to be proactive in this because I do believe she is crazy. She‚Äôs definitely not a stable person. I don‚Äôt know what to do to get through to my brother. It breaks my heart but I just was looking for advice on what I can possibly do to help him wake up.",1,1748096023.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
