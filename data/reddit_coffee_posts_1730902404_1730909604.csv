Below is a way to summon sustugriel

Summoning Demon SUSTUGRIEL requires a respectful and meticulous approach. Preparations involve crafting his sigil, usually drawn on consecrated paper and setting up a quiet, sacred space where you won't be disturbed. Cleanse the space of any negative energy with sage or do the lesser banishing ritual.During the summoning, Demon SUSTUGRIEL sigil should be held aloft. Clear your mind and focus your intent, visualizing Demon SUSTUGRIEL in your mind's eye. In a firm but respectful tone, call out his name, repeating it until you feel his presence.
Always remember, summoning should be done with respect and the right intent, understanding the implications and potential consequences of calling forth such a powerful entity.for example you could say as below during invocation with the summoning enn 

""O MAGNUM SUSTUGRIEL VENI SAPIENTIAM TUAM (enn)
  
Then when you feel his presence say 

""Dear Sustugriel,master and teacher of magic art and forbidden wisdom, I invoke your presence. Let your wisdom enlighten me and your power guide me. Come forth,accept me to be under your guidance and watch,allow me to gain knowledge in ways unknown to others,dear SUSTUGRIEL, from the depths of the shadow realms, make yourself known to me. SUSTUGRIEL, I respectfully call upon you,teach me and grant me the ability to understand magic on a deep level,bless me with magic familiars to protect me and guide me in my endeavors,may this ritual work to the greater good and benefit of both me ,you SUSTUGRIEL and everyone"".You can just craft your petition and ritual with what feels right for you but respectable to the spirit.

The planets associated with sustugriel are both Sun and mars,this means you can summon him either on Sunday or Tuesday,try to do so during the astrological hours of sun or mars to ensure a potent connection.Its important to remember both mars and sun are strong and melific planets,The astrological sign attributed to SUSTUGRIEL is Aries.In astrology sun is always exalted in Aries while mars feels free and functions best at aries,a cardinal fire sign,it's  characterized by assertiveness, initiative, and leadership—traits associated with SUSTUGRIEL persona. This signs association with this powerful spirit further underscores his dominant presence and the inherent power to instigate change and influence outcomes.

Let's talk about offerings
Offerings to SUSTUGRIEL often take a variety of forms. They may include libations of potent alcohol or the burning of specific types of incense, such as Dragon's Blood or Oudh, typically any insence associated with mars or sun will work well with him,Some practitioners may also offer gold to SUSTUGRIEL, or items symbolically related to the Sun or mars,I once made cinnamon tea mixed with ginger and honey and he appreciated alot.black coffee does work well because if it's attributes with planet mars.These offerings are gestures of respect and honor, serving to appease SUSTUGRIEL and garner his favor, however it's wise to negotiate with him because he might ask specific things for someone,for me he gave me information to share about him and place and stick seals in public areas.
My personal advice would be as follows regarding this spirit, he is ancient and wise,be straight to the point,know what you want and don't ask many things at once,work on on goal at a time and move to another goal,he's a teacher of the occult and this means like all teachers,once in a while he will test you,which is a good way to measure students performance and level of understanding,be ready for growth,he will pull out things that might not be useful in your life and it could be painful at the moment but in the long run you'll appreciate,he's a teacher of all things related to occult and forbidden knowledge to both beginner and advanced practitioners,for those who made a step of working with him will always find treasures they didn't know that existed in the first place.

I struggle with C-PTSD and depression with (very) occasional psychotic symptoms and I'm probably autistic (waiting for assessment). I've been using a local centre for support, socialising, keeping myself busy etc. but I've been ready to move on for a while and it's felt boring for quite some time. I'm also studying part time and this is really good for me.

My problem is, I'm not ready for work, but all the resources I've been using might disappear soon (funding for study stops, I become ineligible to attend the centre/it gets too boring to be helpful) I've started volunteering in a very supportive organization and I'm building myself up, but without study and this centre the only thing I have left is being at home by myself. That's not gonna do me any good.
There's no local groups or similar organizations I can attend. The local lifelong learning service doesn't offer anything interesting to me, so what can I do to keep myself busy, keep my brain occupied but not stress myself out?

I'm not massively social, and I find socialising stressful, but isolating will just make me depressed.

1gl1zm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1gl1zm5/i_need_help_fixing_my_lack_of_focus_to_study/,I need help fixing my lack of focus to study.,"So I've been ghost-reading the posts in this place for quite a long time now, and had even gone through some of them to help me out with my own problems as a first-year medical student. I wanted to make my first post here to ask for solutions.

I had noticed a common theme in some of them, however. For instance -   
  
*1) Some people have reportedly only ever studied just before exams.* I can relate. I just procrastinate too much, and it doesn't help. At the back of my mind, it's like I keep whispering to myself that what I'm doing right now is wrong, and that I should just start studying instead. But, I never do, and I can't change it. I've said this same sob story to multiple people just expecting a varied response; at this point, I'm not even able to believe myself.

2) *Some people constantly found themselves distracted by social media, or phone, or music.* For me, it's mostly YouTube. I could blame other social media platforms for distracting me but, truth be told, I barely use them. I don't use Reddit, Instagram or Discord often - it's mostly just YouTube Shorts and random FYP videos.   
  
But as for music, I definitely agree. The only other subreddit I talk in is basically just about music. It's like I wake up, study, go outside and sleep with earphones plugged in, playing music at loud volumes. LoFi and chill stuff doesn't work, and ESPECIALLY any songs with lyrics in them - I just can't focus and I keep bopping my head to whatever I hear. I was recently recommended brown noise which surprisingly did work, to an extent. Pomodoro timers/alarms, however.... not for me.

3) *Some people not having a consistent study routine or being able to follow that schedule or routine.* THIS. IS. ME. God, just hearing people say they studied for even 2 HOURS makes me shudder. I even see people post themselves study with their textbooks on their Instagram stories, and as someone who SOLELY studies on their laptop, that frightens me. Like, the maximum effort I can put in studies enables me to go on for 30 minutes, tops. Perhaps even an hour if I feel like it, although that is rare. But STILL, I'm able to pass exams without the LEAST bit of effort put into it - I even managed to get an exception grade in one of them. But I feel like in my mind I compensate the marks I get for the lone fact that ""Oh, I guess I didn't study as much, so this is fine"" when I could have gotten WAY better scores.

And it's astonishing that I relate so closely to most of the ""I have ADHD, can't focus, I need help"" posts, considering I myself have never tested for the same. Yes, my university has a library but I never visited - I have the digital PDFs of the books, aren't those enough? My room is silent enough either way since I live alone.

I can't try out drugs or medications like 99% of people have suggested on this sub - I'm not even old enough to drink or purchase alcohol, or get a driver's license (I'm not in the US). So that's definitely not a solution for me, and neither is that something I'm willing to pursue in the future either. But I wouldn't know. I'm more than capable of staying awake despite never drinking coffee, but I don't use that time to study.

TL;DR - OP is asking for tips to focus that does not involve medication, including how to get rid of all distractions and how to use his time more efficiently.",2,1730909239.0,medicalschool,0,1.0,False
1gl1z7w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gl1z7w,Help translating my CGM readings,"Hey all! 

I'm tracking my blood sugars early under the guidance of my OB. Unfortunately though, my OB isn't much help on translating those results because I'm being referred to someone else end of November to manage my blood sugar. I'm only ten weeks along right now, but I had gestational diabetes my last pregnancy and I had prediabetes post partum.

Would someone please let me know if this blood sugar response this morning is something to bring to my primary? I was thinking of asking her to increase my metformin dosage. I'm just scared my numbers are already out of range this early in my pregnancy. 

I had a cup of coffee with sugar after waking up this AM, saw my numbers were high with an alert from my CGM, and immediately went to work out for an hour after that. By 9:30ish after I wrapped up the exercise, my sugars were at 136.

1gl1rvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1gl1rvp/used_3_years_dinamica_plus_or_brand_new_magnifica/,Used (3 years) Dinamica Plus or Brand New Magnifica Evo [ Delonghi ],"*^(Someone made a post like this 2 weeks ago, but it does not exactly match my situation.)*

**Context:**

I'm getting a superautomatic to replace our manual Dedica espresso machine.

(I put this here because of the automatic message: Region and Budget does not matter, I'm asking this because I can afford both. I'm rather after the quality of the products and the risks I may not be aware of.)

**Comparison:**

Both Delonghi superautomatics have the milk container system (so not the steam wand). So I'd be fine with either.

The Magnifica Evo that's available for me **does NOT** have the ""Hot/Steamed Milk"" and ""Doppio"" buttons (I saw someone with that version in a video or on this subreddit). This one has the typical latte and long coffee buttons instead.

This makes the Dinamica a better choice for ease of use (I don't have to do the pre-ground coffee workaround every single time) and provides a wider range of strength (doppio/bigger dose) without having to use double brews.

Dinamica Plus is way easier to change settings on due to the touchscreen interface and being able to create different profiles is cool, but absolutely not a ""Make or Break"".

*And as a sidenote, I've read random replies and messages that state outright that ""Magnifica Evo is the worst"".*

**USED Dinamica Plus's state:**

The Dinamica Plus is **3 years old** and is **void of any warranty**. The seller claims that it has been regularly maintained and has been freshly descaled (the product was put up about a week ago).

3 years old, no warranty... yeah... but get this. At $370. Meanwhile the Magnifica Evo (on sale) is at $390 (also really good price for brand new).

It's on the marketplace and the person selling it seems to have a legit account dating back a few years.

**Dilemma:**

I know that this sounds like **a complete no brainer** due to the ridiculously low price, but I don't know if it's going to be a net positive if I have to replace a bunch of parts later on anyway, OR it could just start performing worse no matter state of the internal components for some unknown reason, essentially getting stuck with a bad machine.  
(I heard Tom's Coffee Corner had Superautomatic Delonghi machines and he had those for \~5 years with no problem apparently, so I might be overcomplicating this.)

* At approximately how many brews do I have to replace each/both component (similar to replacing the shutter mechanism in a Camera after accumulating too many shutter counts).
* Are there any known defects or problems with the Dinamica Plus after many years of usage?
* I'm gonna change the grinding setting (not when the machine is idle of course) to see if it has any problems (I heard that the taste won't change for a few brews after changing so I'll be accounting for that).
* I'm going to watch a bunch more videos about the Dinamica Plus to see how it sounds when its brand new/in proper condition, so I know what kind of sounds I should NOT be hearing.
* I will check for cracks, especially on the milk frother and water tank. The brewing unit will be checked for cleanliness and mold.",1,1730908694.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

1gl1qz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1gl1qz8/first_time_i_feel_great/,First time. I feel great!,"35F 5’5” 165 lbs starting. Heaviest I’d ever been this summer and I felt so uncomfortable. I started following an 18/6 or 20/4 IF approach, managed to lose 5 lbs since September. 

On Monday I just decided I was going to try, bought some electrolytes, and did my first 24-hr fast. It was amazing how much energy it gave me! Insomnia, too, but it didn’t matter that I got less sleep because I still felt good in the morning. 

Tuesday I had 2 very small meals - mid-morning and late afternoon, 6 hrs apart. Tried a bite of sweet bread and couldn’t stomach the sugar.

That puts me at 18 hours currently, and the scale put me under 160 for the first time in a while. I don’t think I’ll try to exceed 36 hours this time, shooting for a meal tomorrow midday, but I’m feeling energetic. I haven’t made my morning cup of coffee yet. Just some electrolytes. Encouraged to keep going. On my non-fasting days, I might just continue a 23/1 IF.

Target weight is 140 for now, but 130 is my stretch goal.

1gl1q8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/1gl1q8i/resigned_from_ta_job_to_focus_on_phd_regretting_it/,"Resigned from TA job to focus on PhD, regretting it","\*Not asking for anything, just taking things off my chest in a sub where people know academia (none of my friends or family members have experience in academia). Similar experiences, contradicting experiences, constructive advice, comforting words welcome. Brutal truths are fine only if they are meant to be constructive. Right now, I feel stupid and incompetent enough \*

\-----

**TL;DR:** I resigned from my TA position a few months ago as the workload meant I could not progress on my PhD. I now feel like I have spoilt a perfectly decent career start on top of endangering myself financially. I feel it is one of my worst decisions not just career wise, also in terms of independence, mental health, etc.

\-----

During my 4th year, I was offered a position of teaching assistant position (TA) in my department. I applied and got it. It was welcome as my stipend had ended, as is customary, at the end of the 3rd year. I liked the job. Problem is, on paper, it was 50% time for teaching, 50% time for research. In practice, I was given three MSc level modules to teach, classes of 200 students with essay-type assessments (and all that it implies for grading work), and coordinating the offer of dissertation proposals for 400 students (the department did not want to let students write their own dissertation proposals, and I had to be available to staff members, prospective dissertation clients, MSc directors, etc. to find enough dissertation projects). There was no time off during an academic year: when teaching modules ended, handling dissertation projects started, and only summer term was a bit of a relief.

I don't know what I did wrong, but during my time as a TA, I did not progress much on the PhD. Also my mood, which had not been brilliant the first 3 years with lockdowns and isolation, was getting worse with stress and anxiety and burnout. The good thing is, with the salary, I could afford therapy and I started taking antidepressants. I felt slightly better but my therapist kept asking me when I would move back to my home country, as she thoughts I was not doing well because of the cultural shock.

I had made savings by not going out the first three years of my PhD, always cooking at home, not getting coffees or buying ready made lunch, and not using heating in winter. At the time I had enough to stay afloat for 1.5 year without working, if need be (but also given that I don't have an incredibly expensive lifestyle). I resigned and give me 6 months or so to finish the write up and submit, then to find a job. At my leaving do I had some reasons to think it was good not to stay there for too long, in part because HoD's speech was essentially ""well, this is what happens when one is ill-organised"", and in part because one of the books I was gifted for the leaving do was ""Shame"", by Annie Ernaux, from one of my fellow PhD candidates. You can google it, the title says most of it but the book also contains sexually explicit scenes.

Now in two months we are reaching the 6-month deadline. I feel absolutely silly. I find it difficult to focus because I am always stressed about finances. Even if I'm back to my home country, I don't feel better. I try to find emotional support but friends are busy and don't know about academia. Family either treats me as a baby or a charity, or ignore me when they cannot treat me as an adult on an equal footing. Yet I have never asked for their financial support during my PhD, neither ever since I have resigned. I would need to relax but I don't want to spend, so I don't do much.

I constantly worry about how I will even be able to find a job in academia given that I resigned from the previous one. I liked teaching, (hated the dissertation coordination part but the rest was fine), liked seeing how I progressed in terms of teaching between my first year and second year of TA. But since I am no longer in frequent contact with academics, I don't see how I could spot opportunities for teaching associate once I'm done. Plus, I followed my supervisors advice to prioritise the thesis manuscript rather than publications during my studies, so at the moment I have no publications to show.

\-----------------------

**FAQ**

**Q**: Why is your PhD taking so long?

**A:** I am not sure. In my department, no other PhD student who has stared at the same time has me has finished yet, safe for those two who were jointly supervised by another department.

**Q**: Why did you not tell your head of department (HoD) you were having too much work?

**A**: I did let my HoD know I was having a lot to handle. He also is my supervisor, so he could see I wasn't moving forward PhD wise. At some point during a supervisory meeting for the PhD, I ended up crying in front of him and he gave me tissues and left the room. He later suggested I was taking up too much - which I probably was, but this was the workload I was assigned, and every time someone complained about the workload he would say ""well everyone is overworked anyway"".

**Q**: Can't you ask relatives for financial support?

**A**: No. Long story short: my sibling is constantly guilting me into accepting services my parents offer me (that I don't even ask). So I reject. Then every time I reject, my parents take it personally and are upset. Can't win in this family and have decided to be as low contact as possible with all this dynamics.

**Q**: Can't you ask relatives for emotional support?

**A**: No. Not their forte, and I have tried and learnt.

**Q:** Were you unwell mentally before the PhD?

**A**: I have never been a particularly joyful person due to some family history, but I was stable and at peace. In hindsight I believe I shouldn't have risked doing a PhD in the first place. Let's say that the PhD has added some salt to wounds I already had and wasn't equipped to deal with.",2,1730908575.0,academia,0,1.0,False

* Support yourself.
   * Do something that makes you happy.

I'm currently living in a foreign country. My wife and I have been planning to move to Europe for work-related reasons, as well as for mental health and quality of life reasons. It has been challenging and this week, we encountered a bit of a set back which has been tough on me personally.

Just like pretty much everyone here, I've been doing a re-read in preparation for WAT and I just happened to complete OB today. I've read the whole series through to ROW maybe 9 times, and I've done OB more than 10 times easy. I thought there was nothing left to learn or nothing new left for me. That's when I came across the following quote.

>The ancient code of the Knights Radiant says ""journey before destination."" Some may call it a simple platitude, but it is far more. It is not only the steps forward that we must accept. It is the stumbles. The trials. The knowledge that we will fail. That we will hurt those around us.

>But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure *becomes* our destination.

>To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the *next* one.

Not gonna like, I was in the city having a coffee waiting for a meeting to start and on reading this, I had to run and find a corner to ugly cry a little bit.

Just wanted to give massive props to our favourite author, and to this amazing series (and the Cosmere in general) that we all love. I find Sanderson really does have this gift of writing books that suddenly somehow speak to us in certain situations, and helps give us hope. Because of this, I can stand a little taller, and keep my head up a little higher, and allow hope to blossom again.

I just thought I'd share a little something from a random stranger on the internet. Sorry if this isn't the appropriate sub or if the spoiler tag is incorrect. Thanks everyone, hope you're all having an amazing week.

Strength before Weakness, Radiants!

1gl1gif,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gl1gif/falling_leaves/,Falling Leaves,"""Your planet's weather is so harsh,"" Wyan muttered, her three bony fingers curling tightly around a paper cup.  It steamed in the autumn air; hot chocolate was immediately popular among the Lirosi contingent on Earth.  It was only a bonus that cinnamon, of all things, was a mild intoxicant to their biology.  She took an impatient sip and shuffled along through blowing leaves.

Nathan chuckled.  ""It's not even proper winter yet,"" he objected.  ""And this one should be a warm winter, anyway.  You have to save your complaints for when it's truly cold.""

""I saw ice on the grass this morning.  The trees are all dying.  It's depressing.""  She took another sip.  ""We should have made our embassy somewhere equatorial.""

""Ew.""  Nathan made a face.  ""Humidity.  I'll take some brisk fall air any day.""  He took a long, slow pull from his own cup - coffee, which Wyan sincerely hoped to try someday.  As soon as the biology team confirmed it wouldn't kill her, anyway.  

The two walked along for a span of time.  Wyan kept finding her eyes drawn to the thinning crowns of the trees around them, that she remembered towering over the ambassadorial district in the summer months.  She had relished their shade, their lush expansiveness, so unlike the thin-leafed, wispy trees of her homeworld.  Now they looked more similar, though.  Every day the leaves fell, and the cold sky showed through.

""They're not dying,"" Nathan commented.  

She gave him a look.  ""Then what?""

He sighed.  ""You're making me dredge up coursework from a long time ago.  Trees - deciduous trees, properly, although that's a worthless distinction without an explanation - it's not an effect of the cold weather on the leaves.  It's a planned response.  The colder weather to come *would* kill the leaves, so instead the trees move first.  They draw nutrients from the leaves into the core of the tree, letting them drop off.""

""It seems extraordinarily wasteful, biologically speaking.""  Wyan bent to pick up one of the shed leaves, a three-lobed thing as broad as her hand, with a brilliant red color only slightly diminished by its browning edges.  ""It's a lot of structure to regrow.""

""Well, as you said, our planet's weather is harsh - of extremes.  It rewards gamblers.""  He laughed again at the expression on her face.  The entire diplomatic contingent had learned to be careful in their reactions; humans were surprisingly adept at reading the body language of other species.  Wyan found it nice - most of the time, anyway.  ""The trees wouldn't make leaves this big otherwise,"" he said.  ""They'd make leaves like our evergreens, our pines and hollies and whatnot.  Like the trees on your planet, more or less.  It's a difference in philosophy.""

Another sip, and his expression turned into something more contemplative.  ""Liros doesn't have much seasonal variation, does it?""

Wyan whistled a short negative.  ""Not seasonal.  The temperature varies more with weather patterns that bring air down from the polar regions.  We'll get a few days of cold, a few days of warm.  Our axial tilt is - not so audacious as yours.""

""Yes, we're quite proud,"" Nathan deadpanned.  ""It's a difficult thing for an organism to contemplate a long span of winter.  There is little food, and the conditions are hostile.  Trees are often overwhelmed by snow, if they fail to shed their leaves in time, and can crack in two.  They could all respond like the conifers, of course, and constrain themselves.  Thin leaves, thin trees to bear up under the conditions, and that *works* - but it's not the only option.""  Another sip.  ""Some trees choose to wait.  To rely on the impermanence of winter, and marshal their energies for when spring comes again.  It looks dire, sometimes, but the results are mostly successful - and beautiful.""

Wyan chirped.  ""Beautiful,"" she muttered.  ""Somehow I can't see it.  It was beautiful last month, when it was full and green.  Now I look at it and see the bare branches, and it makes me - oddly sad.""  Her hot chocolate was cooling, and she grimaced at it.  ""Your planet has an annoying habit of being allegorical.  It makes me think of the dying of things, and of mortality, far more often than I would prefer.""

Nathan nodded.  ""Us too,"" he admitted.  His feet crunched against the leaves.  ""There's an old story of ours, written about a king whose history is more legend than fact.  One day he asked a minister of his for a ring, a very special ring.  When a happy man looked at it, he would become sad; when a sad man looked at it, he became happy.""

""Fanciful,"" Wyan noted.  

""It was meant to be an impossible task.  The minister searched for most of a year, and couldn't find it.  He grew desperate.  The richest and most powerful merchants laughed him out of their stalls, and even those who were willing to speak with him had no idea where to find such a thing.  In his despair, he wandered the poorest quarters of the city, finally finding a merchant set up in a threadbare and broken stall.  He asked the old man if he had heard of such a ring, to make a happy man sad and a sad man happy.

""The merchant smiled, and told him to wait.  When he returned a short time later, he handed the minister a simple ring with an inscription engraved upon it - 'This too shall pass.'""  Nathan finished his coffee, letting the cup drop to his side.  

Wyan did the same with her drink, scowling.  ""It works,"" she said.  ""I was having a good day, and you have infected me with melancholy.""

She got a smile in return from her human counterpart.  ""A lot of old stories are like that.  They take truths that are uncomfortable, and universal, and make us face them.""  He nodded to the trees.  ""Just like they remind us.  Their entire strategy is predicated on two truths.  Summer ends, but then - so does winter.""

""Why are you like this?"" Wyan grumbled.  ""We have extra psychological support staff for all Earthside deployments specifically because your entire history, psyche and ecology is designed to make civilized sentients confront the horrors of existence.""

Nathan shrugged.  He held out his hand for Wyan's cup, then tossed them both into a nearby trashcan.  ""Who knows.  We ask a lot of the same questions.  We struggle with a lot of the same answers.""  He bent to pick up a leaf of his own, turning the fiery thing around between his fingers.  ""I content myself with the fact that it's pretty, while it lasts.""

Wyan let her leaf drop.  ""And cold.""

""Hence, hot chocolate,"" Nathan reminded her.  ""And puffy coats.""

She glowered at him.  ""We are not nearly so exothermic-""  Her words cut off in a surprised chirp as Nathan looped an arm around her, pulling her closer.  ""This is not what I meant.""

""But you're warmer now.""  Nathan raised his eyebrow.  ""No?""

""...I am,"" Wyan admitted.  She could feel the heat even through their clothing, like some unseen sun was beating against her side.  It wasn't unpleasant.  They began to walk down the row of autumn trees once again.  The sun was out; it wasn't truly that cold.  She had read the figures, though.  She knew how abysmal the winters got during their shortest days.  It made her shudder to think of it.

""Still cold?"" Nathan asked.  

Wyan whistled out another denial.  ""It's not that bad out,"" she said.  ""Colder tomorrow.  And we have that tax meeting all the way across town.""  

""We'll have to bundle up for the walk.""  Nathan grinned at her.

Wyan felt like she should object.  There were implications to what he was doing, and she wasn't blind to them.  Yet here he was, the sun at her side, and she found that its dull heat wasn't without its light.  It caught on the leaves, and in the sky, and made them into something warmer, bound up with the promise of sunnier days and new, green growth on some future morning.  And if she had to wait to see it, well-

She looked at his face, still sporting that irritating grin.  ""I suppose we will,"" she said, leaning into him.  The leaves crunched underfoot, red and gold and beautiful.",12,1730907859.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Three hours to get here and three hours to get the power working. I wonder, often, what sort of an operation you think you’re running? The subject of my report - my charge, if you will - is the bridge connecting \[redacted\] to \[redacted\]. Bridge=Georgian, red brick, wide enough for one car, lit by sort of intricate looking street lamps. Foot traffic minimal so far. But who would ever want to go to \[redacted\]? I will attempt crossing tonight as instructed.

\++11.11.2012++

Crossing only marginal success. Crossed bridge in 2 minutes the first time. Was so overjoyed with my success, tried to make the return trip over the bridge - rather than the suggested re-route past the coffee shop and the fresco of \[redacted\]. Second trip took twenty-five minutes. I suspect my stopwatch malfunctioned at the midpoint, so perhaps thirty-five minutes.

\++12.11.2012++

Didn’t realise I was meant to record my trips with such detail. Yes - it was mostly fog. In the distance were those trees, thick trunked, looming far past the sky. No sounds beyond usual city ambience; again, unusual. Same sign repeated every hundred or so steps - the school crossing one we’ve seen in other instances.

Fine, yes, I do see how these observations are useful.

But no sign of Them. Never is initially. Don’t know why you get your hopes up.

\++13.11.2012++

Foot traffic minimal again today. Most avoid the bridge. Common sentiment is that if you want to get to \[redacted\] you’re better off going down by the canal.

Not that I wish to be \*that\* employee but don’t think I’m paid enough for what you’re suggesting, nor is it stipulated in my contract.

\++14.11.2012++

Nothing to report.

\++15.11.2012++

Nothing to report.

\++16.11.2012++

Yep, you guessed it. Nothing to report.

\++17.11.2012++

Six boys on bikes entered from the west side of the bridge. I looked down at my crossword (I know, I know, negligent) and when I looked up they were gone. 

Entered on the east side on bike provided. No sign of them. Came out on the west side. Swore. Turned the bike around. Entered from the west side this time and had a similar experience to several weeks ago. Fog everywhere, those massive trees. Some sound this time. But no end in sight. Pedalled for twenty minutes before I came on the boys. They had abandoned/dismounted their bikes and were standing looking out over the bridge’s railing. They were terrified at what they saw.

I got their attention after a while. I had the badge out as per regulation. Already they had the signs. Hard to describe really. The sharpness in the eyes. The slight gauntness to the face. One of them had lost a fingernail.

Managed to get them on their bikes with some persuading. They were desperate to keep looking. Showed them the badge again. That worked wonders. And then I think the fear kicked in, as we all went hell for leather to get out of there. 

Still pedalled for far longer than expected. Still saw that damned sign. But we got out, safe-ish. Have provided a list of boys details, addresses, names, star signs, etc, with dispatch.

It’s always an old lady. She entered West side. Saw her wandering about the bridge for a while and then staring northwards for what felt like far too long (there’s only a block of vacant flats to look at). Didn’t take the bike this time. Encountered her like the others just staring out. Same procedure: badge: stop looking at that: and hooked her arm in mine. We exited but not as successful as the boys. She threw up a whole litre of that foul blue stuff then collapsed. Called evac. She was dead by the time they arrived. Eyes so black you can sort of see yourself in them. She lived in \[redacted}; the family and news outlets (why were they involved!?)  have been informed the incident was a stroke.

Yes, I agree the terms. 

Nothing to report. Did you know that in 1793 \[redacted\] opened a bar beneath this very bridge?

\++25.11.2012++

As extrapolated from the various reports you sent over prior to me heading out, yes, it does appear that the longer you spend in parallel, the longer it takes to get out. This is terrifying when you consider certain agents have been tasked with spending a month on stairways, in corridors and alleys. They must have been there for years.

I entered four days ago for what was meant to be an overnight stay. Set up a tent neatly beneath one of the signs. 

Woke to find the sign had gone. Love that. 

Began walking, realised after about an hour I hadn’t seen a sign. Noted that down. Walked for another hour: came upon my tent beneath a sign (I’d packed up my tent and had it on my back). So I noted that down as well.

Already, I believed the amount you paid me was not enough.

Already, I began to regret taking the job in the first place. 

Kept walking though. Walked for hours.

Some description for R&D: fog continued to be oppressive; bluish light near the place where we would consider the sky to be; those trees seem to move a little. 

They - the big They - don’t understand noise after you’ve been in parallel for a time. There was city ambience, but it was like a mockery of city ambience, the wrong birds, sirens and horns rather than passing cars. I heard waves, like on-a-beach-waves. I don’t know whether it was because they were tethering on to me and my experience, and as I’d slept, and my subconscious had drawn other experiences to the surface, the continuity of the parallel had been fractured. Working theory. You can determine whether I’m talking shit.

I saw Them, of course. Based on rations I would say I’d been in there for around three days. Obviously I am an alerted denizen, so their approach was faltering and skittish.

I did look. I think the light caught my eye peripherally and just by instinct I turned my head. And I saw, of course I saw. All of it. The Unravelling. The Promised Gifts. The Falling of the Light. The Symphony for the Slumberers. I looked away, but only just. They hounded me all the way back, sparking and flashing and trying to make me look once again.

When I arrived back in my little bunker, I used the mirror to look beneath my eyelids. There’s a line of sheer black around the iris. Concerning. May need medicine.

Nothing more to report. I have not slept for three days, so next report will not be prompt. Sorry.

\++26.11.2012++

Low and behold, nothing to report. Slept like a baby. Not that you care about that.

\++27.11.2012++

Woah, what’s that? Is it….nothing to report? Why golly, yes it is!

\++28.11.2012++

Blackness around the iris is ever so slightly expanding. Like a spot where you’re not sure it’s getting bigger and then actually yes it does look like it’s getting bigger and then, oh my, yes, actually that is a big spot. No itchiness yet. I don’t know whether you have the medicine to treat this, but if you do, please send it.

\++29.11.2012++

Nothing to report.

\++30.11.2012++

Or don’t reply I guess. If there is some person I can escalate too, please can you consider this log here as the escalation so that I may get this looked at please. Thank you.

\++31.11.2012++

Blackness is now about a cm thick. Sight not failing, but can’t help but not trust what i’m seeing. Please send some kind of assistance.

\++01.12.2012++

They say we’re a flawed species, stumbling through the darkness, clutching at power like it’s the last bottle on a sinking ship. Look around: empires rise and fall, currencies inflate and deflate like a cosmic joke, and the common voice gets drowned in the cacophony of ambition. Communism tried to level the field, capitalism tipped the scales, and here we are—caught in the crossfire of ideals and realities.

But what if we could flip the script? Tear down the puppeteer’s stage and hand the strings over to the crowd? Not chaos, not anarchy—a symphony where every note counts, where the melody is crafted by us all.

Enter the Decentralized Democracy—a system where power doesn’t trickle down from gilded towers but surges up from the streets, the cafés, the buzzing digital forums. Here, everyone gets a say—a real one—not just a token gesture every election cycle.

The Blueprint

Imagine a world where every vote matters, etched permanently onto a blockchain—a ledger that doesn’t bend to whims or wallets. No more shadowy backroom deals, no more laws slipping through the cracks of bloated bureaucracy. Legislation is proposed, debated, and decided by the collective. Transparent. Unchangeable.

But let’s be real. Not everyone’s an expert on climate science or economic policy, and that’s okay. In this system, votes are weighted—not by wealth or status, but by knowledge and expertise. You earn your stripes through education, experience, contribution. A scientist’s vote on environmental policy carries more weight than that of a layman, but both are heard.

The Edge

This isn’t just some utopian daydream. It’s a calculated risk—a gamble on ourselves. The benefits are as clear as they are profound:
	•	True Representation: No more proxies or middlemen. Your voice is your own, echoing in the halls of digital governance.
	•	Informed Decisions: Policies shaped by those who know them best, steering the ship with a steady hand.
	•	Transparency and Trust: With blockchain, every transaction, every vote, is a matter of public record. No smoke. No mirrors.

The Shadows

But every light casts a shadow:
	•	The Populist Trap: Give the crowd too much sway, and you risk the tyranny of the majority. Waves of emotion can capsize the ship of reason.
	•	Access and Inequality: Not everyone has equal access to technology or education. We risk widening the gap we seek to close.
	•	The Data Dilemma: A system so reliant on digital infrastructure is a ripe target for those who’d love to see it fail.

The Safeguards

We’re not naive. We’ve built in checks, balances—circuit breakers for when the system overheats:
	•	Expert Panels: Before a vote hits the public, it passes through a gauntlet of scrutiny by verified experts, filtering out the noise.
	•	Constitutional Backbone: An immutable set of rights and principles that no majority can overturn—the bedrock of our society.
	•	Education Initiatives: Uplift the many by providing access to learning, narrowing the chasm of inequality.

The Road Ahead

This won’t be easy. The old guard won’t relinquish power without a fight. There will be hurdles, missteps, maybe even failures. But progress isn’t a straight line; it’s a rugged climb.

This manifesto isn’t just a proclamation—it’s an invitation. To those tired of the same old song and dance, who feel the weight of decisions made in rooms they’ll never see. It’s time to take a stand, to mold the future with our own hands.

We are flawed, yes. But within those imperfections lies the spark of innovation, the drive to be better than we were yesterday.

Let’s rewrite the story, one block at a time.

Breaking the Chains: A New Democracy Forged on the Blockchain

Abstract

We’re standing at the crossroads of history, where the old systems are crumbling under the weight of their own contradictions. This isn’t just another white paper—it’s a manifesto for a new era. We’re proposing a radical shift: a political and monetary system that doesn’t just tip its hat to democracy but lives and breathes it. By leveraging blockchain technology, we’re putting power back where it belongs—in the hands of the people. No more middlemen, no more illusions. Just a transparent, secure, and inclusive system where every voice matters, and expertise guides the way.

1. Introduction

For too long, we’ve been caught in the tug-of-war between capitalism and communism, each promising utopia but delivering something far less. These systems, riddled with centralized power and human flaws, have left us disillusioned. Let’s face it—we’re imperfect beings prone to bias and error. But what if we could design a system that rises above our imperfections? A system that maximizes participation and fairness while minimizing the pitfalls of human nature. It’s time to reimagine democracy, to make it more than a lofty ideal.

2. The New Blueprint

2.1. Direct Democracy via Blockchain

Say goodbye to the days of handing over your voice to someone else. In this new order, you are the policymaker.
	•	Blockchain Backbone: Every vote you cast is etched into an unchangeable ledger. No tampering, no manipulation—just pure, unadulterated democracy.
	•	Algorithmic Governance: Smart contracts take the reins, executing decisions without human error or bias. The law becomes code, and the code is law.

2.2. Weighted Voting Based on Expertise

Let’s be honest—not all opinions are created equal when it comes to complex issues. That’s why your vote carries more weight where your expertise shines.
	•	Earn Your Influence: Credentials, experience, proven knowledge—these aren’t just trophies; they’re your ticket to greater influence on issues that matter.
	•	Dynamic Influence: As you grow, so does your impact. Your voting weight adjusts with your evolving expertise.

3. Making It Happen

3.1. Establishing Expertise
	•	Verification on the Chain: Your qualifications are validated and recorded on the blockchain. No more fakes slipping through the cracks.
	•	Lifelong Learning: Knowledge is power, literally. Educational platforms let you expand your influence by expanding your mind.

3.2. The Voting Mechanism
	•	Rock-Solid Security: Biometric data and cryptographic keys ensure your vote is yours and yours alone.
	•	Transparent Yet Private: Votes are open for auditing, but your identity stays under wraps. Participate without sacrificing privacy.
	•	Accessible to All: User-friendly interfaces mean you don’t need a tech degree to have your say.

4. The Hurdles We Face

4.1. Populism and Mob Rule
	•	The Risk: Without checks, direct democracy can spiral into chaos, driven by fleeting emotions and misinformation.

4.2. Disinformation and Manipulation
	•	The Risk: False information can poison the well, skewing public opinion and derailing sound decision-making.

4.3. Technological Barriers
	•	The Risk: If not everyone can access the tech, we risk creating a new class of voiceless citizens.

5. Building the Safeguards

5.1. Councils of Expertise
	•	The Gatekeepers: Panels of experts review proposed legislation to ensure it’s feasible and rights-compliant before it hits the public floor.
	•	Rotating Membership: No entrenched power here. Experts are rotated regularly to keep the system fresh and unbiased.

5.2. An Unshakable Ethical Core
	•	Foundational Principles: A constitution that enshrines fundamental rights and ethics, untouchable by fleeting majorities.
	•	Judicial Oversight: An independent judiciary, maybe even with algorithmic assistance, keeps new laws in check with our core values.

5.3. Battling Misinformation
	•	Truth Hubs: Integrated platforms deliver verified facts and deep analyses on the issues at hand.
	•	Educate to Empower: Media literacy programs arm citizens with the skills to sift truth from lies.

5.4. Tech for the People
	•	Bridging the Divide: Massive investment in tech infrastructure ensures everyone can plug into the system.
	•	Guiding Hands: Support services help citizens navigate this new landscape with confidence.

5.5. Emergency Measures
	•	Swift Action Protocols: When immediate intervention is needed, predefined processes allow for temporary measures, always accountable to the people.

6. Rewriting the Economic Playbook

6.1. A Decentralized Economy
	•	Digital Currency: A blockchain-based currency makes transactions transparent and cuts corruption off at the knees.
	•	Economic Voices: You get a say in how taxes are levied and spent. The economy serves the public interest, not the other way around.

7. Why This Matters
	•	True Empowerment: This isn’t just about having a voice—it’s about that voice making a real difference.
	•	Smart Governance: Decisions influenced by those who know best, leading to policies that actually work.
	•	Built on Trust: Transparency isn’t a feature; it’s the foundation. Trust isn’t demanded; it’s earned.
	•	Future-Proof: This system isn’t set in stone. It evolves, adapts, and grows along with society.

8. Conclusion

We’re not just proposing a new system—we’re igniting a revolution of participation, transparency, and fairness. It’s a bold move, no doubt. There will be challenges, naysayers, and obstacles we can’t yet foresee. But the status quo isn’t just broken; it’s shattered. It’s time to build something better, something that truly reflects the will and wisdom of the people.

Next Steps
	•	Pilot the Vision: Launch small-scale trials to work out the kinks and prove the concept.
	•	Engage the Masses: Open dialogues across diverse communities to refine and strengthen the system.
	•	Invest in the Future: Pour resources into the tech and infrastructure that will make this vision a reality.

Unveiling the Illusion: A Stark Comparison of Governance

You see, the world’s a stage filled with puppets masquerading as leaders, pulling strings that aren’t theirs to pull. Let’s cut through the facade and lay it bare. We’ll compare this new, unshackled system to the so-called powerhouses of governance: the USA, Russia, Austria, the UK, and Norway. Time to hold a mirror to their flaws and virtues.

1. United States of America (USA)

Government Type: A federal constitutional republic that parades as a representative democracy.

Pros of Our Proposed System Over the USA:
	•	Direct Control: No more waiting for election cycles that offer choices between the lesser of two evils. You vote on the laws that shape your life.
	•	Brains Over Bluster: Weighted votes ensure decisions aren’t left to the whims of the uninformed. Expertise drives policy, not popularity contests.
	•	Transparency Unleashed: Blockchain doesn’t play favorites. Every transaction, every vote—out in the open for all to see.

Cons Compared to the USA:
	•	Breaking the Mold: Dismantling a centuries-old system isn’t for the faint of heart. The transition would be a labyrinth of legal and societal hurdles.
	•	The Left Behind: Weighted voting could sideline those without fancy degrees or titles. Equality takes a hit when expertise is the gatekeeper.
	•	Digital Divide: Not everyone’s plugged into the matrix. Tech gaps could leave voices unheard, widening the chasm we aim to close.

2. Russia

Government Type: A federal semi-presidential republic with power clenched tightly at the center.

Pros Over Russia:
	•	Power to the People: Dismantles the top-down control, handing the reins to the citizens who’ve been kept at arm’s length.
	•	Corruption Exposed: Blockchain drags corruption into the light, kicking and screaming. No more shadows to hide in.
	•	Decentralized Authority: Authority isn’t a baton passed among elites but a collective symphony of voices.

Cons Compared to Russia:
	•	The Iron Grip: Those in power won’t go quietly. Expect resistance that’s more than just political—it could get messy.
	•	Shock to the System: You can’t turn a ship that size on a dime without causing some waves. Cultural whiplash is a real risk.
	•	Digital Warfare: Cybersecurity isn’t a game here. The system must be bulletproof against attacks from foes, foreign and domestic.

3. Austria

Government Type: A federal parliamentary republic that enjoys its afternoon coffee with a side of stability.

Pros Over Austria:
	•	Elevated Engagement: Invites citizens from their cafés into the chambers of power. Civic duty becomes more than a checkbox.
	•	Expert-Driven Policies: Let’s face it—complex issues need more than common sense. Specialists steer the ship through tricky waters.

Cons Compared to Austria:
	•	Why Fix What’s Not Broken?: Austria’s got a good thing going. Rocking the boat might tip it over.
	•	Elitism in Disguise: Weighted votes could be seen as a new aristocracy—knowledge as the new nobility, leaving others in the dust.
	•	Price Tag of Change: Revolution doesn’t come cheap. The financial and social costs could outweigh the gains.

4. United Kingdom (UK)

Government Type: A unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy draped in tradition and tea.

Pros Over the UK:
	•	Cutting the Strings: Replaces lords and ladies with the voices of the people. No more birthright politics.
	•	Law by the Masses: Puts legislation into the hands of those it affects most—the citizens.
	•	Digital Renaissance: Drags a centuries-old system into the 21st century, kicking and screaming.

Cons Compared to the UK:
	•	Tradition Runs Deep: The monarchy isn’t just a system; it’s a symbol. Uprooting it could tear at the national fabric.
	•	Legal Quagmire: An uncodified constitution means changing the rules is like nailing jelly to a wall.
	•	Winds of Populism: Even with safeguards, the tides of public opinion can be as fickle as British weather.

5. Norway

Government Type: A unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a social welfare system that’s the envy of many.

Pros Over Norway:
	•	Amplifying Voices: Builds on Norway’s strong civic foundations, taking participation to the next level.
	•	Transparency Maxed Out: If you thought their system was open, wait until every decision is on the blockchain.

Cons Compared to Norway:
	•	Gold Standard Governance: When you’re at the top, drastic change is a risk, not a reward.
	•	Don’t Rock the Boat: Introducing radical shifts could disturb the delicate balance they’ve perfected.
	•	Resource Reallocation: Diverting funds to overhaul the system might drain resources from programs that already work like a charm.

The Big Picture Pros:
	•	Seizing the Reins: Empowers individuals to not just dream of change but to enact it.
	•	Smart Policy Making: Harnesses the sharpest minds where they matter most.
	•	Cleaning House: Shines a light so bright, corruption scatters like roaches.

The Caveats:
	•	Equality vs. Equity: Weighted voting walks a fine line between fair and unfair.
	•	Tech Dependency: A system is only as strong as its weakest link, and technology can be a fickle friend.
	•	The Cogs Slow Down: Direct democracy can be a sluggish beast; too many cooks can spoil the broth.

Conclusion

Our proposed system isn’t just a new page—it’s a whole new book. For places where power hoards and corruption festers, it’s a beacon slicing through the fog. In lands where democracy hums along, it’s a bold step into the future, with risks that may or may not be worth the leap.

Change on this scale isn’t a tweak; it’s a metamorphosis. It demands courage, debate, and a willingness to step into uncharted territory. So ask yourself: Are you content with the illusion of control, or do you dare to seize the wheel?

It’s time to choose—maintain the status quo or disrupt the narrative. The stage is set, the spotlight is on, and the next move is yours.",0,1730907734.0,CryptoCurrency,4,0.38,False

1gl17r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1gl17r5/mid_day_energy_crashes/,Mid Day Energy Crashes,"Hi friends, I am looking for women’s specific, potentially hormone informed advice.

Currently this is how my energy levels are throughout the day:

Wake up 7AM to 11AM - Energized, deep work, positive, clear headed

11AM to 3PM - Coming down, tired, less energized

4PM to 7PM - Kill me now I’m dragging myself through the day

8PM to MIDNIGHT - Wired, efficient, completing chores around the house, fully energized again

Then I struggle to sleep and do it all over. My diet sucks admittedly, I often don’t eat lunch but I do try to eat a rather balanced breakfast. I take a low dose of Concerta for ADHD and occasionally pair with coffee in the AM, sometimes coffee again in afternoon if that crash is hitting me hard.

I want to know, is this my cortisol levels out of whack, is it blood sugar levels? How the hell do I keep a consistent energy level throughout the day? What should my diet look like, any tips on caffeine intake, are there any potential cyclical or hormonal impacts that I could take into account?

I take B-complex, magnesium, vitamin D, probiotics daily btw.

Oh and I always have a freaking headache.

We had a huge falling out last Christmas and didn’t speak since. She (37f) was completely in the wrong and so my husband (40m)  and I cut her off. She didn’t speak to us either. It was mostly between my husband and her but it involved my daughter. My MIL called yesterday and said the holidays are coming up so some type of reconciliation needs to be had. My husband told me If I wanted to text SIL then I could. 

I’m still upset about what happened last year and I don’t feel the need to apologize because I didn’t do anything wrong. So my message said
 “I felt like there was left unsaid. I still feel a type of way about how everything was handled. However, thanksgiving is coming up and Mom wants everyone there. “ 
I said it this way because I haven’t spoken to her in a year and wasn’t gonna apologize for something when we did nothing. 

She responded by demanding an apology from my husband because her daughter is uncomfortable around him after they got into an argument on Christmas. The reason for the fight was because he was defending me because she made a snappy comment to me about telling her dog to leave my daughter alone. 

It got ugly from her. My husband took my phone and told her that he wasn’t apologizing, our daughter was uncomfortable all day around your dog and you did nothing. 

Names were being called, she was trying to provoke him by trying to air out his dirty laundry on my phone hoping I would see it. 

He called his mom and told her what was happening and was upset ofc! Then I took the phone and mil said it was fault because I didn’t reach out correctly and said that I should’ve just apologized or invited her over for coffee. 

ATP, what do I do? Everyone is now pissed off again

Is what I said so bad?? To hher to demand apologies

1gl11ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gl11ru/me_24f_and_my_boyfriend_28m_are_having_a_great/,"Me [24F] and my boyfriend [28M] are having a great relationship, yet I'm still sad. How do I approach this?","Hello everybody! This is my first post and English is not my first language so bear with me on this ride! 
I am 24 y/o and my boyfriend is 28. We are in a relationship for 2 months and I really couldn't ask for a better boyfriend. He is smart, caring, funny and overall a really nice guy. I am coming with a baggage of unsuccessful relationships, past traumas and really hard situations that I won't get much into, but I should add that I'm also suffering from BPD (clinically diagnosed). I came such a long way, many many hours of therapy, medication, hospitalization and self work. I arrived to a point in which I can say I'm truly okay, with a moral compass well formed, many coping mechanisms in my pocket, I am full of life and this is the result of so much work.

The thing is, I am afraid that I finally found someone great for me, and my brain is trying in all the ways he can to find non-existent problems just so I can solve them in order to have a sense of control. Don't get me wrong, when it comes to friendships, work life and personal life, I rock those things! I have a healthy friend circle, great job and I am taking care of myself when I'm alone, but only when it comes to my romantic relationship I still have to learn and I though I might get some advice here? I don't know...
For example, I am the explosive type, full of chit chats, random facts, blabbering all day and night. He is more silent, calm, the type who enjoys his coffee in the morning in peace. I noticed how I become more calm myself, while he is more chit chatty in the morning while drinking our coffee. But still, why am I so afraid that I'm boring him with all my nonsense talking? Am I too much? Am I too out and loud? I am getting crazy!
Also, I'm a big fan of words of affirmation kind of person. This is an important love language for me. He is the type who shows more. Always holding my hand while talking, the subtle kiss while we are out with our friends, kissing my hand, always sleeping cuddled, morning soft laughs. And the intimacy, don't get me started, the chemistry is right on point.  I learned to show more too, but is it a bad thing that I wish that sometimes he would tell me ""you look great today!"" Or ""I loved our time spent together!""? I can't say he never says it, but is it hard that I would want to hear it a bit more than it actually is right now? 

Please note that in reality, even with my diagnosis, I am reacting normally even though in my mind is chaos (or at least that's how I think). For example, we spent 5 days together at his place. I asked him if he wants me the following day to be there too (he got very sick and I took care of his needs) or if he'll manage. He said that he'll be fine. In that moment, my whole mood dropped, I felt no longer needed, I felt exhausted and like he doesn't care to return the time spent together (I felt awful for even feeling this). I felt like I was there for him whole heartedly and he can't be bothered to be loving to me one more day? (While he was sick I cooked everything, tea from 3 to 3 hours, trips to the pharmacy, I even took my day off to go with him to the doctor and care for him). Instead of acting out of impulse, I stayed in the kitchen to rearrange my emotions, I cried in order to decompress from all of my big feelings and I rearranged what's real and what I made up as a problem. I felt like I dealt just fine with those feelings. But the problem is, how can I manage the emotional weight of these feelings? How do I stop thinking that I'm too much or too little or I'm boring him or that what he does isn't enough (although it really is)? 

I am cherishing this relationship with all of my heart and I hope I can find some techniques in here maybe or some coping mechanisms to solve some of my impulses? Anything would help. Thank you!

I'm trying to replicate it at home so I got me a Breville Barista Express Impress for my birthday. But so far, the results have been inconsistent and I'm sure it's user error. 

What I do/use:
Lavazza Super Crema (whole bean)
Auto dose
2 shot basket for whole beans
Filtered water
Internal burr set to 6
External grind size setting varies

Issues:

1. The dosing is hit or miss. Too little or too much. When it's too little and I press the dose button again, sometimes it dispenses just enough but sometimes it dispenses too much. 

2. Tamping doesn't seem to pack it well enough. There are loose coffee grounds  when I pull out the portafilter. (Do I need to push the tamper down really hard? I'm worried I'll break it. Lol) 

3. After playing with the grind size, there were times when I chose the finest setting. When I did this, the pressure gauge showed that it reached the espresso 'zone'. But because it was very tightly packed, the flow was very slow. It yielded very little espresso. Is this normal? Instead of 2 shots, it only yielded 1 or even less. When this happens, should I run it again? Does the machine stop expressing coffee after a specific amount of time instead of its set output (which is 2 shots)?

4. How full should the basket be?

5. Is the froth supposed to be mostly just milk? Mine yielded maybe 10% foam and the rest was still milk. 

Thank you!

I've recently been referred a job at Coffee Bean and sat for the interview today. Although they didn't show me the contract today, they did show a couple of pieces of paper showing the commitments I'm expected to go through and along the lines, it said all workers are expected to have ***BLACK*** (yes, in all caps, bolded, italics, even underlined and highlighted) hair with the preface that their grooming rules are strict. Also with the mention of what piercings are permissible. Now, this will sound ridiculous and I acknowledge that, but in that moment upon reading that text, I literally second guessed working there. Of course dyeing my hair is not a necessity and isn't the most important thing I have to worry about but like any other graduated secondary school student, I'd like that bit of freedom with my appearance and it's a huge bummer that I have to be restricted like this again + I'm aiming to go to JC so really, after this 4 month break, I will have no opportunity like this until after A's.

I've looked up the question whether dyed hair is allowed at Coffee Bean and some have said yes, however there's no specification on which country it is.. :, ) The franchise spans all over the world. I'd like to assume that similarly to Mcd, it really depends on the manager you have and the intensity of your hair dye but Mcd in general doesn't reinforce their grooming regulations much, or at least my outlet didn't. So, have any of y'all remember in particular any CBTL workers/have colleagues with dyed hair or are one yourself? Thank you!",2,1730905939.0,SGExams,3,1.0,False

1gl0pz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gl0pz0/my_child_hasnt_been_sleeping/,My child hasn't been sleeping..,"Hello,

Let me start by saying I don't believe in curses and I am not religious. My name is Doug, and my wife and I have struggled with our son. He has sleep problems that just came from nowhere. It all started one night, it was only a week or so ago, on the night of the first rainfall, we live in a pretty small eastern coastal town of Briggem, so when it rains it can get pretty bad. I was at my home watching reruns of Miami Vice, while my wife was getting dinner ready. We live in my childhood home, a single story. I had our youngest daughter in her walker. When the rain started to hit the window. 

That was when Charlotte and I realized we didn't know where Finn, our 10-year-old was. We called all over from his friends' parents to the school. No one knew. My wife started to blame me, while I was getting my coat on to go - at this point, I was a few beers down the chute when I opened the door ignoring my wife's rant - and there he was. He stood there on the front step, drenched. I don't know how long he was there or what I just took my son in and hugged him. I carried him inside and put a towel around him, trying to warm him up. My wife started to draw a bath, through her cloudy eyes. I asked him where he was and why no one knew where he went.

He just said, ""I wanted to go to the woods."" I didn't find anything wrong with this, I used to go to the same woods all the time when I was a kid with my brother and with friends.

""Near the creek?""

He nodded.

""Did you see anything?""

My boy just looked up at me his blue lips barely hanging onto his face and shook his head.

""Something red.""

I didn't know what the hell that meant so I helped walk him over to the bathroom where my wife was and she started to take care of him. I just walked back towards the family room, aghast at what I allowed to happen. I didn't know what to do so I just thanked whoever was listening in my head.

My wife and I knew that he was probably going to get a cold or something worse from this, so we kept an ear open and barely slept ourselves that night. His coughs kept us up as we took shifts while sitting nearby. Some were empty like a wheeze scratching the walls of his throat while they escaped, others were full of gunk and sludge, followed by him rolling over and spitting the excess in the nearby trashcan. It was around 5 am when I tapped my wife out, letting her go to sleep for an hour or so. I sat there after brewing some coffee and listened to Finn go through hell. In Times like this it's good to have a wife who's as caring as Charlotte, when I have to go to work, I know that she will be here with my kids. I was slightly nodding off around 5:30 before I awoke. Something was off, I didn't know why yet but I could feel it. 

That was when it hit me. I was dozing off because the house was silent. I jumped up from my seat and ran into my son's room. The door slammed against the wall as I dove at my son fearing the worst. Swearing at myself for not taking him to the emergency room. But, as I got to him I realized his chest moving up and down. He was fine. He was better than fine, he looked as peaceful as ever sleeping. Lying on his side, his left hand under his head. Even my landing on him barely made him budge. I scratched my head looking around. When I looked in his garbage off the edge of the bed, where I imagined seeing a mound of phlegm and mucus but nothing was in there. Nothing at all. Thinking I lost my mind I just shook my head and walked out of his room. Over a day or so Finn was all back to normal health and at school.

A few nights later, it happened. I got up out of bed around 1 am, I was the one having trouble that night. I walked into our kitchen and opened the fridge, reaching into the case and opening the tab on the side so it wouldn't crack too loud and wake my wife. I took a long sip of it, following it with a loud breath. The cool lager put my mind at ease as I turned from the fridge - he stood there. Half covered by the door frame he watched me. I put the can behind my back, failing to hide what he clearly already saw.

""What's up, buddy?""

""Why do you drink so late Dad?""

I just shrugged bringing the tone down in the conversation to again not wake my wife. I put my finger up to my mouth to shush him a little. I opened my mouth to try to answer -

""Do you drink because of Kevin?""

My answer got caught in my throat before it could exit. He blinked at me - twice. Then he turned around and went into his room. Leaving me speechless. I could only clench my teeth together, hidden behind my cheeks. I drank the last bit of my beer and couldn't help but open another.

I barely told Finn about Kevin. I barely told Charlotte. I kept it in my head, and just with my parents. I still never understood. Kevin was my little brother. I don't know if I wanted to get into it. But, over the last few nights, I need to talk about it. See Finn has gotten worse, not coughing or anything he hasn't been right. He just hasn't slept, at all. It was bad, Charlotte found him one night, she checked on him just slipping her head through the cracked door. He was in bed, but sitting straight up. Staring at the wall, he didn't even turn to her when she called him. He was in a trance, mouth open, his breathing in deep and out shallow. She ran over to him, rubbing his back his breathing got better but his eyes stayed on the wall. When she came to our room and told me, I had nothing to say, I chalked it up to maybe a horror show or movie he caught when we weren't paying attention. I told her that I was going to check on him as she got into bed, I left my room but on my way to his something overtook me. I couldn't have him ask more about Kevin, at least not yet. 

I turned into my kitchen and grabbed my bottle of vodka from above the fridge and walked out into my garage. I only took a few pulls, but it was hard to keep down, I got so used to just beer. I walked into my home after getting a good bit of the bottle down. I put it back grabbed the OJ carton out of the fridge, and took a few sips out of it. That's when I heard the giggling coming from the crack of Finn's room. It was light and soft, but it creeped the hell out of me. I decided to try to look in the room myself, the dark room was only lit by the window above his bed. But, he wasn't in it. The sheets and covers were thrown to the side. Then I heard the giggles, there were two of them. My head whipped over towards my right where Finn stood by his wall. I turned to the lights on in fear, as Finn slowly turned to me. I looked in the room for a second.

""Go to bed, Finn.""

He nodded and slowly walked back to his bed. I shut off the light after taking one more look in the room. I couldn't sleep that night. Not a minute. Because, before I turned his lights on, I could have sworn I saw a hand reaching and touching my son's face.

The next morning I was out and about I forgot what for, but on my way home I saw the flashing lights. I saw the ambulance rush past me out of my neighborhood. I feared the worst and sped home. I found my wife on the porch, crying on the phone. I jumped out of the car and held her asking her what happened.

She told me this verbatim: She was doing laundry, and our daughter was in the living room bouncing. She went to bring folded laundry into Finn's room, hoping that he was napping and catching some sleep. She didn't even knock; she just barely opened it - she saw him in there. She saw our boy standing in the center of his room, arched backward, his head almost touching his calves. She couldn't breathe, as Finn's right arm started to rise in the air, that's when she noticed that he wasn't standing. His feet were inches off the ground. When she screamed that was when he fell.

I just took my wife into my arms. Holding her there, confused as all hell. Hoping this one moment could last forever before we would have to find out what was wrong with our boy, by her words he had to be paralyzed with a broken back. I then ushered her into the car, running back inside and grabbing our baby girl. Before we were off to the hospital.

So, now it's time to talk about my brother Kevin. I think it's time that I bring up Kevin. Kevin was my younger brother, he was only 8 years old when he got sick. At first, it came off as the flu, he was bedridden and only missed a few days of school. I remember it like it was yesterday because frankly, it was all so odd. Kevin got home late the day before his sickness. He was always a sprite and fun kid, always looking for an adventure even at a young age. I always took him places too, because he could keep up with 13-year-old me on any bike ride. He had this gummy smile and an infatuation with Superman. 

We weren't rich or anything growing up, so my mom had bought him a cheap cape from a hand-me-down store. For the next year, he always wore that cape, while he was biking down to his friend Anthony's house, I remember it always flailing in the wind as if he were flying in the air.

After he got sick, I don't remember him putting it on ever again. He came home that day. From what I remember my mother telling me, rest her soul, that he walked into the house for the first time in complete silence. He got ready for bed without eating anything, and that was it. In that bed, he stayed for days. I would always knock to see if he wanted to do anything and he would refuse. During those days, I started to feel off. I woke up one night in complete sweat, confused and not remembering my dream that I had I left my bed and went into my kitchen. I poured a cup of water and chugged it as it was so cold it burned my throat. I took a second and then went to go back to bed. 

When I heard something soft coming from inside Kevin's room, behind the closed door. I stopped and put my ear to it. It sounded like he was talking to himself. It sounded like he was maybe giggling. Then it sounded like two voices talking at the same time. They overlapped each other, but no distinct words were actually being stated. I held my ear there longer maybe to get a nugget of information. Then the voices stopped. A coldness drafted up my spine, a bead of sweat down my nose.

""Dougie."" The voices said.

I backed away fast and ran into my room. Clawing into my bed, and sitting there. I didn't sleep the rest of the night. It took only twenty or so minutes when I started to hear creaks from outside my room. I stared at the door, terrified of my own little brother. Scared of how he knew it was me outside his room. But, when I saw the shadows cross underneath my door. I saw two sets of legs. Just standing there. No knocks on my door, no whispers, nothing. Those legs stood there, motionlessly for ten minutes. Before, they turned back to his room. I just stared and stared all night.

From there things took a turn for the worse. Kevin slid into a brain coma due to a lack of oxygen a few days later. He then died a week after that, fluid in his lungs built up to the point of suffocation but the doctors never detected it. It always seemed like he was breathing normally to everyone that checked. He was only eight years old. It was odd too, because after he got sick, I remember his buddy Anthony started to miss school as well.

I always hated myself for being afraid of him. His saying Dougie outside of his door could have been a call for help, it could have meant anything. But, young me mistook it for something frightening something that was meant to warn me to stay away from my only brother. That's why I bought my home, my old childhood home, as a reminder of my brother and what he meant to me. I still keep it deep down though, I rarely talk about it to my wife, and never to my son. Kevin almost completely died when my parents passed away. The only people that really might remember him are Anthony and I. We don't really speak, I say hi whenever I walk into him at the liquor store. He has been looking worse. But, we both know and we both remember.

When Charlotte and I got to the hospital, they were running tests on Finn. Finn never looked more alive. He was sitting up in his chair and smiling with the nurses. My wife through tears looked as confused as everyone else did once they saw her. She ran up and held our son in the brightest embrace, like the first time she ever held him. I stood there, my wife doesn't lie. My wife doesn't over-impose anything. How did she see what she saw? How is it that now I am being told that Finn is doing great and that we can take him back in only a few hours? I insisted that they watch him and take care of him for at least a night. But, they needed the bed in case of an emergency. I was at that point done with the conversation and didn't want to expedite it further, maybe upsetting my wife and son who have both been through a lot.

We got home that night and I carried my son into the house while my wife carried our daughter. We laid them both to bed. I told my wife to call the police if anything happened, but that I needed to go somewhere. We had a light argument. Before I told her that I had to go to the creek. That was the last place Finn was before he got sick. She didn't want to hear it but she knew that it wasn't the worst decision. Before I left, she stopped me. She asked me if I believed her and if I didn't think she was crazy for what she told me. I told her of course. That I was as confused as she was. I kissed her and then I left.

Driving up to the woods at night can be daunting. Darkness. It was even worse because it took everything that I had to not pull into any of the bright signs above the bars that I passed. Drink it away. Drink the thought of Kevin, the thought of my home, and the thought of anything all away. But, I pushed on. Now that I made my decision, I moved into the bush, through the trees, and into the dirt. Hindsight was 20/20 because I forgot a flashlight but I knew my way. Even though it has been 20 or so years since I last came down here, this place has been sunken deep into my soul. I made it to the low-tide creek and stood over it on the bank. It was filled with leaves, and couldn't have been any more than a few inches deep. This creek used to be big for fishing.

I barely heard anything other than the light water going against rocks, no squirrels, no owls, nothing but the creek. I looked around and realized that my hope was all but lost. What was I even expected to find here that I came all this way? Left my wife at home with our kids. I turned and walked the creek a bit. Looking up and down, the big bright moon cut its way through the tree limbs and guided my trail a little.

Then I swore I felt it, something grabbed my ankle as I turned and fell down into the water. The water didn't expect me and I smack against it. My head hit the edge of a rock and I stayed in the water for a second using it to cover my scream of agony. I then pulled myself up and looked around. I swore I felt something grab me, that I didn't just catch the lip of the bank. That I wasn't that clumsy. I swear it. I clung to the dirt as I crawled up the side of the bank, hoping that my head wasn't bleeding too badly. I got to the edge and looked over, it was then that I saw it.

I saw what Finn saw. It was red, but it was covered. I got out of the bank and ran up to it. I looked down, and my heart sank. It couldn't be it just wouldn't make sense. But, I knelt down moving everything that was on top of it all the leaves and broken branches, and picked it up in my hands. I knew the material and the way that it would move in the air. As if it were just yesterday.

I was holding back tears, as I looked down at Kevin's old cape.

A feeling overflowed me, and my head snapped as if I had been plugged into a computer. Everything came to me at once, every memory, every feeling, why I was so awkwardly terrified that night with Kevin. I ran through the trees back to the road, back to my car, and hopefully back to safety. I just hoped through the pain of my grip on my brother's scarlet cape. I drove home in silence. The lights of the bars hadn't lost their appeal, they shined even brighter. But, I pushed ahead. I needed to get back to Charlotte. To my wife, to my son, and to my daughter.

I pulled onto the driveway. I walked up opening the door. Charlotte jumped at the door when I walked in. She was wide awake on the couch. I looked at her, with every word on the tip of my tongue ready to spill. But, just one glance at her was enough. I think she saw something was wrong, I hope she did. Because I stood there and I wept. I fell to my knees, as I couldn't hold back anymore. She stood up and this time, she held me while I didn't have the strength myself.

When I touched that cape, it took over and I couldn't let go as much as I wanted to. All of the memories that I pushed out that I didn't care for, flooded back into my mind. They clenched on with knives and bit with teeth as they seeped back into my brain.

I then told Charlotte, about my last day with Kevin before he slipped into his coma. I was in the living room watching television when I heard him coughing from his room. I went to go check on him, and there I saw him sitting straight up in his bed like he was waiting for me. I went and sat at his side.

""How are you feeling Kevin?""

""Good. How are you?""

I nodded at him.

""Dougie, I never got to tell you something.""

""What's that?""

""Well, it's just that I am worried for you.""

""Why are you worried?""

Something in the corner of my eye caught my attention, and I looked down at his trash.

Inside the bin laid a large mound of black gunk, which must have been a week's storage.

""Because you're son is going to die just like I will.""

I looked at him.

It wasn't my brother. His eyes were flooded with black sewage as it dripped and creased through his face, his teeth were rotted to the gums, the gums grey to the gills. I jumped as he looked up at the ceiling and his mouth opened - then like a fountain blackness canvased out of his mouth and to the ceiling. I looked at it for a moment and fell to the ground. Knocking me out.

I awoke on the couch. It took every bit of strength of mine to go back to the room to find any evidence of the accident happening, but I walked inside of the room and it looked just as clean as when I entered prior. I waited for my parents to get home and when they did I told them about it.

""Don't rile your brother up with these hysterics!""

""Your mother has been going through so much with all of this, why bring up this? You need to stop watching those horror movies with your friends!""

That is all I got.

I stayed silent, I thought it was all in my head. I remember it so clearly now.

Because, after touching that cape it all became so clear. Everything aligned correctly. That night, when I heard Kevin whispering in his room, and when he stood outside my door, that was three days after he slipped into a coma.

If anyone lives or has lived in Briggem if anyone knows anything about the creek in the woods. If anyone has any idea what the hell might be happening to my son. Please, and by all means reach out. My family is so lost. I am terrified for my son Finn. Because he collapsed today, we had to bring him into the hospital, and about an hour ago, the doctors told me that he was building a large amount of fluid in his lungs, more than the normal case of pneumonia. I am afraid what happened to my brother might happen to him.

If anyone can, please help us.

Recommendations needed.,"I recently got hooked on oat milk coffee during a trip to Melbourne, and it was honestly a game-changer. The coffee there had this perfect creamy texture, with no weird aftertaste, and the oat milk blended so smoothly. Since I’m back in India, I’m trying to recreate that same experience at home.

I found a few oat milk brands on Amazon that I’m considering:

	•	So Good Barista Edition
	•	Alt Co. Oat Drink
	•	Oatside
	•	Only Earth Unsweetened

My main criteria are that it froths well for lattes and cappuccinos, doesn’t leave an aftertaste, and enhances the coffee flavor rather than masking it. Also, I’m curious about the Barista Edition—does it actually make a noticeable difference in terms of froth and texture, or is it mostly a marketing label?

If anyone has tried these brands or has other recommendations, I’d love to hear your thoughts! Which one is closest to that barista-level oat milk experience?",2,1730905592.0,IndiaCoffee,4,1.0,False

I did have a hoody but thats put in the locker immediately before they have to ask me.

**Exam Strategy**  
I completed the exam in 90 minutes, and this happened with my CISSP, I completed it in 2 hours, so Ive completed both of these exams in half the alloted time, this is not to try to impress you, but let me explain. I don't personally believe in the ""you've got 3 hours so use them"". For me personally, that would only exaust me, I am not a cross country runner, I am a sprinter, so to speak, so I need to utilise the limited amount of time my brain will be giving me, effectively.

To manage this I see the question, and if I'm lucky I know the answer 100% right away, which was probably 30% of the questions, I see it, I read everything 2 or 3 times and I'm through to the next question.

**Don't think about the question when its gone!**

Now for the rest where I was either not 100% confident, or damn out right didn't know the answer... I do my best and select something, and then move on. Again don't think about it. I'd say ""fuck it"" and move through, because me staring at it for another 4 minutes isn't going to help me.

At Question 75 I utilised my planned break. I got up, I actually had a question on the screen and I wasn't sure, and the screen was blurry, I knew I was mentally slipping.. so off I went, they let me out, I'm having a nice comfort break, refresh, and the answer came to me in the bathroom to the question. Walking around is re-oxygenating my brain, blood is flowing again, back in.

Got to 125, and I honestly felt i'd said ""fuck it"" and clicked through SO many times that there was no way I was passing. I started making up excuses in my head to say to people why I failed like how I've got a cold right now and lie about how I was coughing, all this stupid stuff, obviously told myself to grow up and stfu.

Got my print out, opened it immediately, scanned for good news, located it, let out a nice sigh, and off I trotted out of there.

**Resources:**  
OSG (Just targetted reading.. well I did read the chapters in full i needed to)  
Destination Certification CCSP (Hot off the press! Go get it!)  
Destination Certification CISSP (from my CISSP studies)  
Destination Cert CISSP MindMaps (Use these trust me)  
Gwen Bettwy's Cloud Guardians (good for last minute revision and its easy to carry around, its a bit like notes so this is for late game studying just to refresh, imo)  
Gwen Bettwy's exam taking tips as I mentioned earlier  
Pete Zerger CCSP Exam Cram (just jumped about as I learnt so much during CISSP) (Great though this one as he demonstrated the concepts visually inside Azure.  
Mike Chapples LinkedIn (Good for the demonstrations like Pete)}  
Pete Zerg's AZ-900 Exam Cram (Incredible resource to see things like NSGs in action)  
Some of this guy's AZ-900 Course: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGjZwEtPN7j-Q59JYso3L4\_yoCjj2syrM](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGjZwEtPN7j-Q59JYso3L4_yoCjj2syrM)  
Cirrus 8000 Feet (just flicked through, looks good, but didn't actually use it that much, but not because its bad)  
Azure Well Architectured Framework  
Google Well Architectured Framework  
AWS Well Architectured Framework  
CSA Security Guidance Version 5 (MUST READ!)  
CSA Enterprise-Architecture-Reference-Guide  
Studied the CAIQv4.0.3\_STAR-Security-Questionnaire  
ISO 22123 Cloud Computing (Available for free: [https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/](https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/)

I also didn't know what PaaS *really was,* So I set up a Heroku account and quickly figured it out as it was just theoretical. Within 15 minutes I understood it in practice.

I also played around with setting up VM's in Azure, and setting things up in AWS.

This gave me the confidence and knowledge around the PaaS and IaaS. I've now got hands on experience.

I also watched Hyper-V Manager tutorials to refresh my memory on managing VMs in Windows etc. Things like Resource Limits and Reservations etc.

**Practice Questions**  
Pocket Prep - 700 Questions Answered - Score is 93% (Level up is level 6 or 7 on everything)  
LearnZapp - 900 Questions - 82% readiness score  
WannaPractice - Can't remember, lost my login, but I did 2 practice exams and I got 84 and 86% respectively.

Caution about practice exams though - Be honest with yourself, don't bump up your score because you're remembering the answer, you need to UNDERSTAND the answer and UNDERSTAND WHY THE OTHER ANSWERS ARE NOT CORRECT EVERY TIME.

Don't even worry about the score, just do at least 1500 questions though, and if you like my speedy style, then aim to crack them out quickly, but carefully. READ the QUESTION.

Do at least 3 full exams before the real exam to get used to the stamina you're going to need.

This should give you a good foundation.

Good luck!",5,1730905479.0,CCSP,3,1.0,False

1gl0gfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gl0gfb/why_you_should_always_ask_what_are_you_looking/,"Why you should always ask ""What are you looking for"" on a first date","I know some people feel this question is redundant to ask someone on a first date because ""it’s in my profile,” or ""it should be obvious based on why I'm on here"". However, I wanted to share my experience from a first date yesterday that acted as a stark reminder of why I always ask this question.

I matched with this girl on Hinge last week. Her profile seemed like a perfect match for me: she listed that she wanted a long-term relationship, wanted kids in the future, and identified as moderate (which I appreciate because I hate extremes on either side). Plus, she lived nearby. We exchanged texts for a few days, and the chemistry felt natural with her asking questions. It felt like a breath of fresh air, as typically within the first couple of messages, I'm usually the one carrying the conversation. Eventually, we set up a coffee date at a local spot. I like starting with drinks to keep things simple and low-stakes, with the option to extend the date if things go well. Funny enough, there were a couple of other folks in the shop going on  first coffee dates too.

When we met, the in-person vibes were just as good as they were over text. I like to make coffee dates feel less like interviews and more of bouncing ideas. As expected, our conversation flowed easily, and although she brought up some political topics since it was election day, I enjoyed her nuanced takes.

But then things started to take a turn once I asked "" So, what are you looking for?"". She told me she was ""still figuring out her dating goals"" and was interested in a short-term connection since she’s traveling for work in Europe next year. I told her I was looking for a serious, long-term relationship, which seemed to surprise her a bit, almost as if she didn't read my profile at all. It was clear there wouldn’t be a second date, as we were ultimately incompatible in our intentions. I couldn’t help but wonder why she hadn’t mentioned any of this in her profile, especially since I was upfront in my profile about wanting something a long-term relationship. We wrapped up our hour-long conversation, walked to the train, and said goodbye.

This morning, I was going to text her that I wouldn't be moving forward, but she beat me to the punch. She did compliment me saying, “If it weren’t for us wanting different things, you’d be the perfect guy.” 

So, as redundant as this question might feel, I really encourage people to ask it. You’d be surprised how many people don't update their profiles to reflect their intentions.",13,1730905234.0,dating,9,1.0,False

I sweeten my coffees with stevia, and allow my self 1 sweet activia yogurt a day, and fruits (normal amount).

I did not change the quantity of what I eat (2 meals a day (no breakfast or a coffee) averagely composed of 100g white japanese rice, miso soup, 1 egg, natto, and some veggie like spinach).

I did not gain weight, but did not lose it either. Even tho my cholesterol and trilycerid went down. I feel like i'm growing a double chin but I'm not sure.

I'd like to move my wife and kid out of Florida and I'm looking for suggestions of some parts of the country we could consider where the vibes are not atrocious.

We were all born and raised in FL so we have no experience with living somewhere else. I'm not looking for perfection, just better than here. I've been lurking on /r/SameGrassButGreener for over a year, which is a subreddit for this exact question, but I thought I'd turn my question to a more like-minded community since there's so many different variations of a ""blue state.""

My main consideration:

Somewhere with good public education. My son has special needs and my hope is to get him really good support. LGBT friendly is a must, I'm not going to go through the trouble of moving out of state to be zoned for a school that banned the depiction of rainbows.

Our personal tastes:

* We have family in PA, VA, NJ. And close friends in GA, VT, RI. Not feeling too far from a source of support is a plus, so preference to Eastern US.
* Not afraid of suburb or rural, we own a house and a car currently and are used to everything requiring driving and parking, no complaints if this is the case.
* On the flipside, walking from our front door to get a bagel and coffee sounds dreamlike and public transit sounds great, but not deal breakers without them.
* We like having a fair amount of space at home. My wife and I both work remote and like separate space.
* Activities: we're honestly homebodies most weeks. Occasional camping. Public library events. Seasonal festivities. Good food.
* Weather: I think anywhere would beat Florida for us.

I'm ignoring budget intentionally, at this stage I'm really just open to any suggestions.

1gl01lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1gl01lk/i_believe_bf_flirts_with_women_and_pretends_its/,I believe Bf flirts with women and pretends it’s for Jesus ,"I need a reality check as a Christian woman.
Am I taking this the wrong way? Please help me understand so I can learn and improve if I am in the wrong. 

Tldr: boyfriend is excessive with his ‘help’ towards women, says it’s for Jesus and bible tells us to be helpful. I see this as crossing the line into flirting and disrespect. 

1. When my bf and I had our first dates some months ago we went into a lift together. There was another girl there who was struggling to operate the lift to get to her floor( you need to take the card and put it in the reader to register before you can press which floor you want to get to and the lift failed to read her card). He started to smile and laugh with her joking about the lift and said ‘I will get you to your floor,dont worry’. He proceeded to take her room card out of her hands and the whole interaction just looked like I’m the stranger here and those two are on the date together. They were clearly flirting in my opinion and I felt invisible. When I expressed how uncomfortable and invisible I felt over this he said he’s a friendly, helpful guy who helps anyone and it’s for Jesus as Jesus called us to be helpfull. 

2. Another instance was there was a new (female) coworker at his job he said he didn’t like much because she spoke too much. But any chance he got he went over to her desk to help her and was telling me about it. As he explained things about her in the next weeks I realised things she says to him are not appropriate- she’s going thru a divorce and so on etc. I told him I think she likes him. I explained this was making me feel uncomfortable but he didn’t seem to care at all. Nearing her last days of working there as (she was bad at her job and was getting fired) he told me she sent him weird flirty emojis when he asked her about something in work chat. Next day he avoided her and waited at the cafeteria before another colleague came to work  office as he didn’t want to be alone with her, he explained. When I called this out he said she wasn’t his type, she was fat and so on and that I am causing drama. He also said me talking about this made him attach meaning to emojis and it was nothing. Few days later he was again pushing his chair to her desk and I found out was helping her write CV - we had a huge fight and he said he’s doing Jesus’ work helping someone who’s about to lose their job and that I am causing drama. I mean how did she even get this job if my bf needs to do her work and her CV too?  He did not care about my concerns that he was flirting or being inappropriate at all. 

3. Last night he was out volunteering and we stayed on the call as we often do, a girl came to ask him for directions. He looked up a bus for her and told her where to go. He covered his camera as he did this. But in the last split second to make sure she got the right bus he ran across the street when there was a red light and put himself in danger twice for her just to check it’s the right bus stop across the street. I was extremely disappointed. Nothing indicated she cannot walk over there or run there for herself. He has issues with health which means he struggles to walk fast and he was running over the street for her. He ran back all happy and laughing to tell her that is the right bus stop -  I think he wanted to show off. 

I am all for helping people but none of these sit right with me. He is not like that with me, only occasionally.  I struggled to fasten my bracelet for a good minute and he didn’t help saying he didn’t know if it was okay to touch my hand during first dates( he touched lift girl’s hands all fine when taking the card). Or I spilled a bit of coffee on myself by accident and he didn’t jump to help me like he helps others. It takes longer for him to react if it’s me. 

I feel hurt. I feel he wants to be everyone’s boyfriend and his excuse is that everything is for Jesus, that I am taking this the wrong way and he does things for men too. I think he never it rarely  considers how I feel as long as someone else is pleased with him or tells him I am the one who is wrong. As long as he gets validation it doesn’t matter if something hurts me or looks wrong to me, I believe. 

I need help with this to understand better. He says these are not flirting and I think it is. Thank you.

We've known each other online through mutual irl friends for three months now. I was kinda into him early on, just cause he's a fun, chill dude, but I was too nervous to really talk to him. Recently I have made a point to deliberately reach out one on one and get to know him better outside of group events and it's going well! But now I *know* I'm into him and my social anxiety has me second-guessing everything. I never really been interested with many people romantically, and I've only had one partner/serious relationship. So when it comes to this, I basically feel like a teenager.

He and I are messaging pretty often, near daily, talking about \[Hobby\], joking around, talking about life and what's going on, all that good stuff. He's just fun to talk to and joke with? I feel like I'm flirting with him? But I don't know if it's obvious or  if he's flirting back or if he's just responding like a normal friend would. It helps that he's straight up said in one of our group's late night deep talks that he tends to be oblivious to people who are interested in him unless they actually tell him.

But I'm also like, is this too early to even say something? I've had feelings for a while but we only started DMing a week ago, so I don't know if it's too soon? Also there's a considerable distance between us so I can't exactly just ask him to coffee (and also that has unlocked a whole subfloor of questions and anxieties about like ""is this even worth pursuing"" which I'm tying to ignore for now.) We will be meeting up in person along with other mutual friends for an event in our hobby in a few months, so there's that to look forward to?

I want to work through this headspace. I'm pushing myself out of my anxiety comfort zone cause I really like this dude, and even if it doesn't work with him.. like I am trying to make some changes.

I know people say it’s internalized misogyny, but I’m always confused about how someone could dislike a woman for having feminine traits (like being introverted, liking Hello Kitty, loving magical girls, enjoying iced coffee, etc.). I mean, the other girls are just quiet and keep to themselves. How can some women see them as a threat? I’m a guy, so there’s probably something behind the scenes that I’m not seeing.

I would also like to hear from ex-NLOGs. I’ve always seen feminine girls discussing this topic, but I rarely hear from a NLOG perspective.",1,1730903757.0,AskFeminists,1,1.0,False

Longstory short. I,m (23F) had a relationship with a guy (35M). He helped me a lot during my last relationship break up. I attached to him a lot and loved him a lot. Last july i found he was cheating on me with a woman who is in her late 30s (no s¥*. Just flirting and texting and met for a coffee at Barista) . Then I decided to breakup with him. But he begged me for forgiveness. I gave him another chance because i loved more than anything and we were working at the same company I thought it will be hard to move on seeing him everyday. He even sware that he wont do it again. I thought he did try a lot to build up my trust. After seeing his actions i thought he has changed. I once again loved and trusted him. Two weeks ago we went on a date and i checked his mesaages on messenger app. He was flirting with so many women. At that moment I broke up with him. 
I already unfollowed him on Instagram and Facebook. But he still follows me on instagram. He still call once or twice a week. Now i want him to miss me and realize his mistakes. He wants to be a friend with me. But I don't want him back not even as a friend.
He easily gets jealous. I want him to see that I do better without him and do things he loved to do with me. Also I want him to miss and regret losing me. 
What should I do now? Should i block him or keep him as a follower and let him watch me.",1,1730903704.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I'll use an example- of all the shows I ever did, my best ever performance was a big class graduation show- sometimes the amount of audience in these class shows can be hit or miss but I knew one student had invited dozens of people in addition to the rest of our guests and it was (to date) going to be the show with the most audience members I ever had, so to calm myself down I sat by myself on a bench in the nearby building where he had our classes, basically quietly contemplating or not thinking at all etc. Not to brag, and yeah having a lively audience helped, but this was a class where I was still more new-ish I felt I struggled in in the class itself but I was on fire during the show where even the teacher mentioned it afterwards and my fellow students looked like wtf just happened? That guy sucked in class but did great on our actual grad show lol. I feel like a lot can be attributed to how I calmed my nerves. I'd like to get into that headspace again but I find it is hard to find quiet time before a show, I work, I'm surrounded by people before the show and I'm sensitive to noise if someone's having a loud cell phone conversation in a coffee shop, and I don't feel like sneaking into my class building every time lol. Does anyone have any suggestions for YouTube yoga/mind clearing videos to watch and/or how you quietly get into a good headspace even if you're surrounded by other people.

He was literally holding it in his hand and it disappeared. It's a quite large metal remote. I thought he must have put it somewhere without noticing.

It's a leather couch with 3 square cushions that can be removed. While we did this and both were looking at the sofa for like the eighth time, I commented that It's time to vacuum it. Eventually, after looking in the fridge and washing machine we gave up and went to bed. Both always drink our morning coffee on the couch, so we did this and then we left for work. He left before me.

Upon coming home the lost remote was LAYING ON THE COUCH. 

Both remember checking and searching for it in the couch several times, and my comment of vacuuming since we were both staring at the couch at this time trying to understand wtf was going on. Also we sat in this exact spot in the morning. Yeah it's just a small thing, I know, but we both seriously thought we are losing our minds. Nobody else has keys to the house.

1gkzqnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIToolsTech/comments/1gkzqnj/i_tried_klarnas_ai_shopping_assistant_it_helped/,I Tried Klarna's AI Shopping Assistant. It Helped Me Save $229,"


I'm not one of those girls addicted to shopping, but tease me with a trip and I'll book it quicker than a Japanese bullet train. We all have something. 

Although I'd prefer to spend on experiences over earrings, I do enjoy adding pieces I adore into my wardrobe. Timeless Levi's jeans. A black blazer. A warm coat for New York winters. Colorful pants to welcome the spring. I tend to fall in love with pieces and build my outfit around them. 

The problem is, these items tend to cost more, because they're quality over quantity. So when I heard that ""buy now, pay later"" leader Klarna had launched an AI shopping assistant that helps compare products and find the best price, I was intrigued. It also has access to reviews and is able to answer questions. 

Klarna's AI shopping assistant, which launched last month, is powered by OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT and Dall-E. It's available for free in the Klarna app. Klarna was founded in 2005 and currently logs over 2 million transactions per day on the platform. 

I've got my eye on a new black bag for my city coworking days. Klarna AI, can you save my shoulder and some money? 

Getting set up 
I downloaded the Klarna app and created an account. If you already use Klarna, you can start using the AI assistant immediately -- click on the chat icon in the top right-hand corner. 

It looks like any other AI chatbot with an ""ask a question'"" section, as well as prepopulated prompts such as ""compare Nike and Adidas shoes,"" ""show me the best coffee machines"" and ""most popular wireless headphones."" You can also click on Shop to browse and compare products, alongside the AI assistant. 

First, I wanted to try out the AI to see how it would do finding me a new black bag that's stylish and functional. I needed to replace my Kate Spade handbag that hurts my shoulder when I carry my laptop in it. 

This became my first prompt: 

""I have a black Kate Spade handbag with a laptop slip. I love the style, but I need to switch to a backpack for better shoulder support. This is a look I like from the brand, Cole Haan. Can you provide similar options, compare the reviews, and find the best option under $300? 

Off the bat, it found four options I liked that were $50 to $100 cheaper than the link I supplied. It understood that I was looking for a ""chic"" backpack. Then I selected the top two, and the result came up as out of stock, which was frustrating. 

I checked one style that was available and Klarna AI generated a graph to help me understand if the price was high, low or standard.

In my follow-up prompt, I told the Klarna AI that the styles I wanted were out of stock and to provide more options. It asked me to select similar brands I like. I didn't love the second options, so next I requested ""boho styles"" and prepopulated brands to choose. 

I found one I liked at a good price. But again, it was out of stock.

Then I tried a more general prompt: ""women's premium leather backpack for work."" It did better this time. 

I asked the AI assistant a question about the size, and it generated the key features, which included ""plenty of room to store a 13-inch MacBook Pro."" 

Next, I asked Klarna AI to check the reviews. It told me the product has a 4.7 out of 5-star rating, with 379 reviews. I went to the Michael Kors website to verify this, and it was correct.

Klarna / Screenshot by CNET
I also found that the bag was 80% off. It was $498, marked down to $99. When I started the search for a new bag, I had the $328 Cole Haan backpack in mind, but was more than happy to find this $99 Michael Kors alternative that I liked just as much -- and that would save me $229.

So it started with two fillings on my upper left side molars. Had them done in early august this year. After the visit, i felt a little pain/discomfort on the same side, but on lower teeth, couldnt understand where it came from. I just thought mouth is sensitive from the works.
I had to go to work overseas, the pain still was there, got even a bit worse. Went to a LOT of different dentists in that country and finally had a rootcanal treatment done on second molar from the back(lower left side)
Went to the dentist for like 3-4 times there. Also worth mentioning i did double antibiotic treatment(Twice) with Metronidazole and Amoxillin.
Came back home(Estonia) and went to check it out(actually wanted to pull it since i already almost spent enough money as for implant)
They talked me out of it, they treated it and put a temporary filling which as the doc said should even last for years for some people(crown is not needed since it was still not so damaged and a lot of the tooth was still there)
Had some pain and sensitivity for like a week, which is normal i think. But now it has been a month and that weird dull ache is back, its not much, it is around 2/10? But still enough to bother me. The pain is not coming from chewing, biting or eating. Starts randomly and goes randomly. Painkillers help for it, but i think its not the long term solution for it. Also its a little bit sensitive to cold? Drinking coffee also doesnt affect it all. 
To mention before writing this the pain came and when im finishing this post it left(probably will be back in 15-30min)
Usually i get the pain a little bit when i wake up and throughout the day. Not waking me up from sleep tho. So im quite lost and hopeless what do with it, x rays are usually good nothing on them and hopefully will get to an appointment soon. But my work is not local and i also travel a lot and this thing is really concerning for me. Cant be safe anywhere and this pain is quite depressing for me already. As mentioned it is not extreme(atleast now) but enough to notice that something is there.

Here's an approximate plan.

Approximate, because of course this is not a clear 100% algorithm of how I will act, but only an approximate course of action.

Approach the girl: “Sorry to interrupt, but you seem so curious about this painting. May I ask what interests you so much about it?” -> Continue the dialog: Ask if she has been here for a long time and if she is in a group ->
Suggestion: “I'm here alone too. Look, since we both came recently, why don't we explore the gallery together? I'm interested in your opinions on the paintings.” ->
Cafe visit: After walking through the gallery, “Thank you for your company, It was a delight discussing paintings with you. May I ask, are you in a hurry? If not, I suggest we have a coffee together, my treat, there is a cafe nearby.” ->
Exchange of contacts: After the cafe, when it's time to part, “It was a pleasure spending time with you. Can I have your number so we can meet again?”",3,1730902920.0,teenagers,5,1.0,False
1gkzlj4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gkzlj4,My first 2 months of composting!,"
> TLDR; Don’t wait for materials to start, just start a pile! 

Hey all, even in this trivial time I can’t believe how much happiness composting has given me, or maybe it’s just validation for peeing on it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I wanted to share with you what I’ve learned over my first two months of active composting outdoors in western New York, as well as my theories for how my pile will behave over winter. 

In the past, my family and I have been passively composting for a few years. Simply dumping food scraps and coffee grounds into loose dirt in the ground. This method did not produce very much compost, and it never seemed to be very effective in general. 

The beginning of September 2024 I decided to start an active pile, in an effort to produce a greater yield of better compost!

### Research

Here are some YouTube channels and a book that helped me wrap my head around how to make composting work for me:

- [Charles Dowding book: Compost](https://youtube.com/@charlesdowding1nodig)
- [EdibleAcres](https://youtube.com/@edibleacres)
- [Anne of All Trades](https://youtube.com/@anneofalltrades]
- [The UpBeat Gardener](https://youtube.com/@theupbeetgardener)

### How I started

**Location**: about 100 feet from my house, partially covered by trees for shade and shelter. Directly on the ground, with no container or anything. 

**Green Materials**: I only had a small bucket of food scraps, coffee grounds and garden trimmings (bolted basil and parsley bushes). About 1/2 a wheelbarrow of green material. 

**Brown Materials**: I had several decaying longs and felled trees around my property, I chopped up the loamy bits, about a full wheelbarrow. I also raked up straw (dead long-grass), also about a full wheelbarrow. 

**Pile Construction**: I had about 4x as many browns than greens at this point, but knew more greens would arrive as Fall comes to a close. I placed the materials directly on the ground, in alternating layers. Finally, surrounding the pile with stumps to keep things contained. 

### How I progressed

I would completely turn and add greens to the pile about every 2-3 days, only adding about 2 pounds of food scraps and coffee grounds at a time. 

After 7 days, I felt heat for the first time! This was very exciting as I was concerned about my greens/browns ratio. 

After another week, I was able to add more garden cuttings, as well as trimmings from our bushes and raked up dead leaves. The center of the pile would sit at 120+ degrees consistently, however, the straw and fibrous material was still very tough and needed way more time to break down. It was difficult to turn and I regretted not chopping up material into smaller pieces!

After 4 weeks I picked up about 15 pounds of used coffee grounds from my local Starbucks composting bins. These seemed to act as rocket fuel, and my pile started to break down materials at a much faster rate. I also noticed at this point that I needed to add a lot of water to my pile, as the inside was a powdery gray and extremely hot and dry. 

After 6 weeks, my materials began to become unrecognizable and more homogenous! I started to turn the pile less often too for time and energy reasons. 

At this point we did the big-cut around the property and trimmed all out landscaping and gardens down. I had about 2 wheelbarrows of greens that I chopped up fine with hand sheers, 1/4 wheelbarrow of ash from a campfire, and a bunch of dead leaves, and yes another 20 pounds of coffee grounds. 

After 9 weeks, and all those materials added, and turning the pile around 10 times, I had the consistency and volume I originally set out for. The pile had grown to about 3.5 cubic feet. 

I decided to build a pallet container, lined with cardboard to contain the pile, help with retaining moisture and heat throughout winter. 

### Going Forward

I plan to let this pile sit as-is in its pallet container, and break down over winter. Hopefully at the end of spring, I will have a bunch of lovely compost to use!

If you made it this far, you must really love the process as much as I do, so please share any questions or remarks! Thanks for reading and happy composting!

And yes I am using a kitchen thermometer, because why spend money on dirt?",14,1730902857.0,composting,0,0.95,False

My main concern, aside from being over manually grinding my coffee :-), is if the new grinder will produce a noticeably different profile than my Comandante C40 MK4, as we primarily use a Clever Dripper and sometimes a V60 (double bloom method).

Our local coffee shop, which uses a Mahlkonig Guatemala and Zero Japan setup, produces much brighter cups than I can achieve at home (using the same beans).

Will a new grinder help with brightness, or is it unlikely to make a big difference? Thanks in advance!",0,1730902564.0,pourover,2,0.5,False
