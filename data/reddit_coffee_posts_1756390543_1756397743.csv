Don’t you ever feel pressured to be in a relationship? Because that’s exactly what I’ve been feeling lately, probably since most of my friends are already in one. There are times I want to go out, like visit a coffee shop or just chill somewhere, but wala akong makasama since my friends and I are now busy with our own lives after graduating college.

Back in high school and college, I really chose to stay single and focus on my studies, and I was happy with it naman since I didn’t feel na single ako because I was always with my girl friends. But now that I’m entering adulthood, I sometimes find myself wishing I had someone to share stories about life with, aside from my family, and my communication with my friends is not as frequent na rin.

I’m only 23 though, and part of me still wants to focus on my career and becoming financially stable since I’m just starting out. But feeling ko once I start, I’ll be a workaholic, baka wala na naman akong time lumandi and hindi rin ako maalam in person haha. But tbh, there are times na parang naiinggit na rin ako sa mga friends kong in a relationship. I’m also a homebody person so I don’t even know how I’d meet someone. Kusa ba talaga dadating, like maghihintay na lang talaga ko? Or maybe I really need to put an effort to meet people na? Hahaha.",1,1756397474.0,AskPinay,0,1.0,False
1n2gi5m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2gi5m,Custom display background,"This is quite a specific request and I hope it can be accommodated here….

I am looking for a custom background to display a belt buckle I recently obtained. 

Here’s what I’m hoping for:
•The attached photo cropped to make a square (can the field on the left be cropped leaving as much of the path and sea as possible. 
•A yellow to orange to pink gradient added to the photo. 
•The attached SIRONA 100 logo added to the top 1/4 of the illustration. 
•The words “CYMRU - 2025” added beneath it in a similar but smaller font. 
•The text “MOTHER NATURES ROLLERCOASTER
BARMOUTH - CARDIGAN
Saturday 23rd August - Sunday 24th August”
To the bottom 1/4 of the graphic. Again, in a similar font if possible. 


I need the middle 50% to remain clear to clear so that when this is printed at 160mm x 160mm there will be space to attach the buckle. 


I have attached the for reference:
* A rubbish drawing of my intended design 
* A photo to crop and colour
* A copy of the Sirona 100 logo (to use and to match to the font) 
* A copy of my race number to give a vibe of the theme and font I’m going for
* A photo of a previous buckle to try and show the end result and presentation I’m going for. 


If you check the Sirona 100 website, this also gives a great vibe of the theme I’m going for too (especially in relation to the coloured filtering of the photo). 


I’m guessing this should be a pretty quick task for those in the know (which sadly I’m not). Happy to tip $5 to buy a coffee for the best. 


Many thanks. ",1,1756397440.0,PhotoshopRequest,1,1.0,False

M-F 8-5s are a blessing for most.,"I've worked probably five or six incredibly shitty jobs in my life.

Finally found my footing and have been working at an office for going on 8 years now and it's wonderful. No job is without it's shitty days and aspects but this beats what I used to do by a long shot. 

I can just get up from my desk and go grab some coffee or take a quick walk outside and nobody is going to yell at me? I can go to the bathroom whenever I want? If I need to work from home that day or just don't feel like coming in I can just send my boss a quick a text to let him know? I get paid even though I'm on vacation? I get paid even though I'm eating lunch and can take my lunch whenever I want? I have a consistant schedule so I can say with confidence if I'll be free whether it be tomorrow, next week, or 6 months from now? Sometimes I literally have no work to do and I can just talk to my coworkers and keep an eye on my team/email? Sign me up. 

A lot of people, especially young people on Reddit, look at a 40-hour a week office job as some kind of absolute hell on Earth but for most people it's truly a blessing as long as your company, boss, or position doesn't completely suck. The actual structure of most boring office jobs is so much better than the alternative for most people.

1n2gf3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n2gf3x/the_energy_game_when_hard_work_becomes_your/,The Energy Game: When Hard Work Becomes Your Superpower ⚡,"

Ever wonder why some people seem to thrive under pressure while others burn out quickly? The secret isn't about working less or finding shortcuts—it's about understanding the fundamental difference between two types of effort that shape our daily lives.

## The Tale of Two Efforts 🎭

Picture this: You're putting in 10-hour days at work. In one scenario, you're dragging yourself through tasks that feel meaningless, watching the clock, counting down to freedom. In another, you're so absorbed in what you're doing that time flies by unnoticed. Same hours, same effort—completely different experiences.

This isn't just about workplace satisfaction. It's about understanding a principle that affects everything from our morning routines to our biggest life decisions.

## The Stress Trap: When Effort Feels Heavy 😩

When we pour energy into activities that don't align with our interests or values, our bodies and minds rebel. This misalignment creates a unique form of exhaustion that goes beyond physical tiredness.

**What happens inside us:**
- Our nervous system stays in constant alert mode
- Mental fatigue sets in faster than physical tiredness
- We start dreading what should be normal activities
- Recovery time increases dramatically
- Decision-making becomes harder

Think about forced small talk at networking events, studying subjects that bore you, or maintaining relationships that drain your energy. The effort required feels disproportionate to the task because your internal compass is pointing elsewhere.

## The Passion Engine: When Effort Becomes Fuel 🔥

On the flip side, when we engage with activities that genuinely interest us, something remarkable happens. The same amount of effort—sometimes even more—feels entirely different.

**The transformation includes:**
- Time distortion (hours feel like minutes)
- Natural focus without forcing concentration
- Problems become puzzles to solve, not obstacles to endure
- Energy seems to regenerate during the activity
- Learning accelerates naturally

Consider a programmer debugging code at 2 AM, an artist perfecting their craft, or a parent teaching their child something new. The effort is real, but it doesn't deplete—it energizes.

## The Science Behind the Feeling 🧠

Modern research reveals why these experiences differ so dramatically. When we engage in activities aligned with our interests:

- Dopamine pathways activate, creating natural motivation
- Stress hormones decrease even under challenging conditions
- The prefrontal cortex operates more efficiently
- Neural pathways strengthen, making future similar tasks easier
- Overall life satisfaction increases

This isn't wishful thinking—it's measurable brain chemistry working in our favor.

## Practical Detection: Identifying Your Energy Patterns 🔍

**Daily Energy Audit:**
Start tracking your energy levels throughout the day. Notice when you feel drained versus energized. The patterns will surprise you.

**The Monday Test:**
How do you feel Sunday evening thinking about Monday morning? Your reaction reveals whether your primary activities align with your interests.

**The Time Warp Check:**
Which activities make time fly by versus drag on? This natural time distortion is your internal compass speaking.

**Recovery Speed:**
After challenging tasks, do you feel depleted or invigorated? Passionate effort often leaves you tired but satisfied, while misaligned effort leaves you empty.

## Life Applications: Making the Switch 🔄

**Career Choices:**
Instead of chasing salaries or status alone, factor in daily energy cost. A lower-paying job that energizes you might lead to better long-term outcomes than a high-paying position that drains you.

**Learning and Growth:**
Choose skills and knowledge that genuinely interest you. You'll learn faster, retain more, and actually enjoy the process.

**Relationships:**
Invest time in relationships that energize rather than drain you. Quality connections require effort but shouldn't feel like work.

**Daily Routines:**
Design morning and evening routines around activities that align with your natural preferences, not what others say you should do.

## The Long Game: Building Sustainable Effort 🎯

**Start Small:**
You don't need to revolutionize your entire life overnight. Begin by identifying small pockets of your day where you can shift toward more aligned activities.

**The 80/20 Approach:**
Aim for 80% of your effort to go toward activities that energize you. The remaining 20% covers necessary tasks that might not excite you but need doing.

**Skill Development:**
Invest in developing abilities that naturally interest you. You'll progress faster and enjoy the journey more than forcing yourself into areas that don't resonate.

**Environmental Design:**
Structure your environment to support passionate effort. Remove friction from activities you love and add small barriers to energy-draining habits.

## Navigating Necessary Unpleasantness 🛠️

Reality check: Not everything in life can be passion-driven. Bills need paying, responsibilities exist, and some tasks are simply necessary regardless of our feelings about them.

**Strategies for required tasks:**
- Bundle boring activities with enjoyable ones
- Set specific time limits for energy-draining tasks
- Find personal meaning or learning opportunities within necessary work
- Use completion of unpleasant tasks as fuel for passionate activities
- Delegate or eliminate non-essential draining activities when possible

## The Ripple Effect: How Others Benefit 🌊

When you operate from passionate effort rather than stressed obligation:
- Your work quality naturally improves
- You become more pleasant to be around
- You model healthy behavior for others
- Your energy becomes contagious
- You contribute more meaningfully to your community

This isn't selfish—it's strategic. Happy, energized people create more value for everyone around them.

## Common Myths to Avoid ❌

**""Follow your passion"" oversimplification:**
This principle doesn't mean quitting everything that requires effort. It means being strategic about where you direct your energy.

**""Passion eliminates all difficulty:""**
Passionate work still involves challenges, failures, and frustration. The difference is in how these difficulties feel and affect your overall energy.

**""You either have it or you don't:""**
Interests can be developed. What matters is paying attention to your natural curiosity and energy patterns.

## Creating Your Energy Map 🗺️

**Week 1:** Track your energy levels hourly for seven days
**Week 2:** Identify patterns and themes in what energizes versus drains you
**Week 3:** Make one small change to increase aligned activities
**Week 4:** Evaluate the impact and plan your next adjustment

## The Future-Proof Principle 🔮

This understanding becomes even more valuable as automation and AI handle routine tasks. The uniquely human ability to find passion and meaning in our work becomes a competitive advantage. People who understand their energy patterns will thrive while others struggle with motivation and fulfillment.

## Your Next Move 🎬

Tomorrow morning, before checking your phone or starting your routine, ask yourself: ""What would I choose to work on if energy weren't a constraint?"" The answer might reveal more about your optimal path than any career test or personality assessment.

Remember: Life is essentially an energy management game. Those who learn to direct their effort toward activities that energize them don't just achieve more—they enjoy the journey. The goal isn't to eliminate all challenging work, but to ensure that most of your effort flows toward what naturally motivates you.

The choice is yours: Will you spend your energy fighting against your nature, or will you harness it by aligning with what genuinely interests you? The effort is the same—the experience is completely different.

1n2gdt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/StatesOfMind/comments/1n2gdt4/early_menopause_vs_microdosing/,Early menopause VS microdosing,"Sharing an anonymized community story about early menopause and microdosing (published with permission). In their words:

Early menopause hit me at 38 and it knocked me sideways. The brain fog, the heat that rises from nowhere, sleep that vanished, a libido that felt like it forgot my address. Harder than all of that was the grief and the sense that I had slipped out of my own skin.
I tried vitamins and phytoestrogens, and they eased a few physical things, but my body and mind stayed heavy. Zoloft softened the edges yet never felt like me. Reading through this sub gave me the nudge to try microdosing.

I began around 100 mg most mornings and, after a couple of weeks, settled near 200 mg on most following Stemets’ protocol. Early mornings work best for me, five or six, and about ninety minutes later there is a clear gentle lift that lasts close to an hour. I drink coffee, write a little, breathe, then start work.

At first I wondered if it was placebo, but I started journaling and it showed that it works. Mood swings quieted, anxiety shrank to something I can carry, however, the sadness is still part of me yet it no longer drives. I feel present with my partner again and intimacy found its way back.

I thought it should be about seeing colors or getting high, but it has felt more like rebuilding a steadier relationship with a changing body and mind. If you are older and curious, you are not excluded from this.

Sharing this because I spent too many late nights searching for a way to feel like myself again.

If you want more than one person’s story, there is an article with research that backs microdosing for menopause and shows improvements in mood and related symptoms.

Sophie, just a month past giving birth, cradled her newborn and headed to the City Registry to get a birth certificate\] 

“Officer, the baby’s name is Joseph Wilson.” 

The clerk tapped on his keyboard, his frown deepening. “Under Matthew Wilson’s file, there’s already a child named Joseph Wilson registered. Years ago.“\] 

Sophie froze, sure she’d misheard. “No way. Our baby just turned one month old-“\] 

Before Sophie Harris could finish, her phone buzzed.\[\]\] 

She glanced at the screen. It was a photo from Monica Moore, Matthew’s assistant. 

In the picture, Matthew had one arm wrapped snugly around Monica’s waist, holding a boy of about five or six in the other. All three stood in front of a preschool, their smiles painfully bright.\] 

The name tag pinned to the boy’s shirt clearly read: “Joseph Wilson“.\[\] 

A text popped up right after: 

\[So. Ms. Harris, how’s it feel to be the other woman? Get used to living in my shadow. From the real Mrs. Wilson. 

A cold vise clamped around Sophie’s heart. Her fingers trembled as she spoke to the clerk.\] 

“Could you… please check Matthew Wilson’s marriage records?‘ 

The paper slid out of the printer, light as a feather, but it landed in her palin like a ton of bricks 

In Matthew Wilson’s marriage record, the spouse’s name was unmistakable: “Monica Moore.” Date of registration: seven years 

ago. 

“Ma’am, do you still want to register this child?” The clerk’s voice sounded a million miles away. 

Sophie looked down at her daughter’s sleeping face, a bitter smile twisting her lips. 

“Register her under my name. And while you’re at it… change her namer“\] 

Leaving the registry, Sophie’s steps were unsteady, like walking on clouds. 

Her phone buzzed again. A message from Matthew.\] 

\[Hey babe, stuck in a meeting. Be home later to see you and our little one.) 

Seeing “babe,” Sophie almost laughed out loud. What a joke.\[\] 

For years, he’d called her that every day. He’d text when he was leaving, hug her the second he came home. All that constant. 

tender attention? Now it just felt like a thousand tiny cuts.\[\] 

She slid into her car, her hands shaking so badly she couldn’t get the key into the ignition.\[\] 

She knew the rules of their wealthy circle–most power couples lived separate lives. But Matthew… he was supposed to be the exception.\[\] 

Once, at a charity gala, some socialite mouthed off to her. The next day, Matthew bankrupted her entire family. They were run out of town.\[\] 

She’d once mentioned offhand that she liked some limited edition handbag. He flew halfway across the globe overnight just to see her smile. 

But the memory that really stuck with her was that health scare.\]\] 

A nurse mixed up the charts and told her she had kidney failure. Matthew’s eyes went red. He grabbed the doctor’s lab coat, yelling:1 

“Take my kidney! Take both of them! If she dies, I die!“\] 

When they realized the mistake, that cutthroat titan of industry crumpled in the hospital hallway, sobbing like a child.\[\] 

“Thank God, Sophie… you’re okay…“\[\] 

People had always warned her: Matthew’s empire was growing, and so were the women trying to get a piece of it.\] 

But he treated her so damn well. How could she ever have doubted him? 

But why Monica? 

Matthew used to despise her. 

Monica had been their housekeeper. Once, she’d served Matthew coffee while wearing a ridiculously low–cut top. 

He’d smashed the cup on the floor. “Don’t pull these cheap stunts in my house You’re fired.” 

Then he’d pulled Sophie‘ into a tight embrace, his gaze burning\] 

“Baby, you’re the only one for me. Any trash that tries to get near me, I’ll throw them out on the street“\] 

Monica was on her knees, sobbing and begging. Matthew didn’t even glance at her 

“I love Sophie. I don’t tolerate dirt. Get your trashy self out of my sight.“|| 

Monica scrambled to her feet, pale as a ghost, and packed her bags that very day. 

When Matthew later hired her as his personal assistant, this was his explanation: 

“Sophie, after she lost the job, her family tried to marry her off to some old geezer. She was threatening to kill herself. I figured at’s better to keep her close, where I can watch her, than have her spreading rumors about us.“\[\] 

At the time, Sophie had believed him.|| 

Who knew they’d been carrying on right under her nose for over six years, raising a whole other kid.\] 

Sophie gritted her teeth, blinking back the burn in her eyes, and called a private investigator.\[\] 

Half an hour later, a video with a location pin landed on her phone. 

She drove straight to the address.\] 

Matthew wasn’t at the office. He’d just left a parent–teacher conference at Joseph’s preschool. 

He was holding Monica’s hand, with the boy, Joseph, in his other arin. As they crossed the street together, the gentle smile on his face looked more genuine than any in their posed family photos, and the sight was a knife to her heart. 

She hit the gas and tailed them to a villa in a gated suburban community. 

She watched Matthew get out first and pull a massive box of toys from the trunk. 

The boy, Joseph, cheered, grabbed the box, and ran off. Monica leaned against Matthew, chiding playfully, “You spoil him rotten.“\[\] 

“He’s my son. If I don’t spoil him, who will?“\[\] 

Matthew dipped his head and pecked her on the lips. “Besides, he got the most gold stars in his class today. Made me proud.” 

Monica looked up at him, her eyes glistening. “Oh, Matthew, thank you for getting Joseph into the best prep school.” 

“Really… his birth was an accident. I never wanted to bother you. Just seeing you from a distance was enough for me. We would never want to get in the way of you and Ms. Harris…“\[\] 

“Don’t be silly.” Matthew pinched her cheek, his voice soft but clear.\[\] 

“She’ll never know. Besides, you’re the one on the marriage certificate. It’s my duty to take care of you and our son.“\] 

Monica’s tears turned to laughter. Matthew suddenly leaned in, his voice dropping to a whisper in her ear, “And since were married, shouldn’t we be fulfilling some… spousal duties?“|| 

Monica’s face flushed crimson as he swept her up into his arms and carried her quickly into the villa.\[\] 

Sophie sat in her car, a dull blade sawing at her chest. She drove home in a daze.\] 

When Matthew walked in that evening, it was like any other day. He opened his arms for a hug the moment he stepped through the door. 

“Hey, babe, did you wait long? Was the baby a lot to handle today?” 

Sophie sidestepped him smoothly. “About the baby’s registration…” 

“I’ll handle the registration another day. Don’t you worry about it“|| 

Matthew’s tone was suddenly sharp, but seeing her face pale, he softened it instantly, coaxing her.\] 

“It’s a huge pain to get it d 

pain to get it done right

I can't get out of this hole I've dug for myself, it's almost impossible for me to get out of. 

I want to better myself, but when it feels like I start to, I trip and fall again. I'm always tired despite doing literally nothing all day, I've lost my creativity and my passion for drawing, which sucks cause drawing IS my passion. 

I'm super unhealthy, I hardly drink water, I don't eat healthy, and I'm embarrassingly out of shape. 

There's been a lot of stress going on, I'm currently living with my aunt and my mom due to my parents getting a divorce and me and my mom are moving to Washington, so I just kind of stay in the room she gave me and my mom all day every day. No socialization, no activity besides watching YouTube or TV, doing my best to draw, talking to my friends, or playing games on my iPad or laptop. 

I recently got back into a decent sleep schedule but it doesn't even feel like it. I'll sleep from 8-9 PM to 8-9 AM and still feel like I've pulled an all nighter. I never feel awake no matter what I do. I've tried coffee, or just caffeine in general, and while I do like it, it just makes me MORE tired. 

I feel like if my mom didn't make me get up to do stuff or move around constantly, I'd be bed rotting. I wouldn't move at all and that thought scares me. I've even come close to doing it maybe a few months ago

I don't want to harm myself in anyway, though I still feel extremely depressed. It doesn't help I have anxiety, autism, ADHD, really bad social anxiety AND borderline POTs. My body can't choose one problem😅

My initial thought was Akechi. He’s an experienced killer, and the motivation that the mascots would die is so out of left field for him he could have seen his opportunity that no one would suspect him. Unfortunately, he is wearing gloves, which disproves the need to wipe fingerprints, unless the hand towel is also a red herring. I have to look elsewhere.
The Big Bang Burger and Leblanc Coffee clearly point to P5, with my first guesses being Joker or Haru for their familial ties. It’s not Joker, because he pointed it out. Could it be Haru? She’s got a sadistic side, but despite how close she and “Mona-chan” were, I doubt it’s enough to kill her friend Futaba over. Besides, Haru is probably the mastermind anyways, so wouldn’t kill this early. If I’m right about THAT part, I want it publicly stated I’m better than all of you.
But Futaba also has a connection to Leblanc coffee! Plus, Naoto was there when she was in the cafeteria, and if she saw her eating that, it would easily make sense to her! So, that was possibly Futaba’s last meal. But why is that important?
Let’s circle back to the crime scene. The TV was found near Futaba’s legs. It makes way more sense to repair something on a table, so we can maybe assume it was shoved off or dropped before the killing happened. But why the laundry room? It seems oddly coincidental that it’s the same room where a towel can be washed. This led me to my first conclusion: that Futaba was lured to the laundry room to fix the TV. 
But by who? Obviously someone who at least recognized the benefits of fixing the TV. That’s either one of the P4 cast, or someone else in the room when it was destroyed. Then it hit me.
Ken was shown to be in that room! Joe didn’t mention him by name at all (I wonder why), but he was there! Plus, he’s got a considerably strong relationship to Koromaru as well, and as anyone who’s seen the 10/4 event knows, he’s not above killing under extreme duress. That’s my pick for the killer. But how did it all play out?
Let’s get inside Ken’s head. He knows Koromaru is going to die with the other mascots if no one kills anyone. Then he sees (lol) the TV incident, and notices Futaba bummed out that she can’t fix it. Then it hits him. 
Ken does some planning, and figures out the laundry room is the safest bet to kill someone, wipe away any prints, and wash any blood splatters, including on clothes. Then he approaches Futaba and convinces her to take the tv with her to the laundry room so the two can try to fix it together. As she’s throwing away her lunch, he leaves, saying he’ll meet her there. Secretly, however, he grabs a knife and rushes to the laundry room, lying in wait.
Futaba isn’t the strongest person, and struggles to lift the TV all the way  to the laundry room. As soon as she does, though, Ken makes his move. He stabs her in the lower back, him being noticeably shorter than Futaba. She drops the TV in shock, which falls to the floor by her legs, and slumps on to the table, dead. Ken then uses the in-house laundry materials to wash anything pointing him to the crime, and retreats back as if nothing happened.
There you go. That’s it. That’s my prediction. If I’m right, it will make up for not getting the role of Akechi in this. If I don’t, it still will. This was a blast!

A Day in Blüdhaven with Chazz Monet

Blüdhaven, the perpetual twin in Gotham's shadow, wakes to the metallic hum of commerce and the distant exclamations from its battered piers. The city, known for its hard edges and harder luck, is home to Chazz Monet—alias Agent Cash Money—the only IRS agent in the DC universe who can bench press a city bus if he’s holding enough gold bars. On this rare Saturday, the ledger closes and Chazz steps into the sunlight not as a super-powered auditor, but as a man seeking peace among the chaos.

# The Morning Routine: Coffee, Contacts, and Currency

Dawn in Blüdhaven is a mosaic of neon and soot. Chazz’s apartment is perched above a pawn shop, the walls lined with vintage tax codes and framed stock certificates—a shrine to the order he brings to financial entropy. As he brews his coffee using beans purchased with a perfect balance of cash and credit, Chazz scans the city skyline, mentally cataloging each block’s fiscal health.

His phone buzzes—a group chat titled “Cash Crew.” Here are Chazz’s trusted associates:

·         Marina “Numbers” Santos: A forensic accountant with a hacker’s intuition, Marina can trace offshore accounts faster than the Batcomputer can decrypt a message. Her friendship with Chazz is rooted in mutual respect: she admires his power, he admires her precision.

·         Darius “Ledger” Lee: An ex-GCPD detective, Ledger left the force after uncovering corruption so deep, only the IRS would touch it. Now, his knowledge of the city’s underbelly helps Chazz navigate Blüdhaven’s labyrinthine criminal networks.

·         Helena Voss: Not quite a vigilante, not quite a civilian, Helena is a local journalist whose exposés on corporate malfeasance have earned her both enemies and admiration. Her rapport with Chazz is equal parts flirtation and fierce debate—a dynamic that evolves as the day unfolds.

The morning text exchange is lively, filled with banter, memes about “superhero deductions,” and plans for brunch at The Greenback Grill. Today, though, Chazz’s mind drifts to Helena. Is it possible that beneath the bravado and well-thumbed ledgers, something tender stirs?

# Strolling Blüdhaven: The City’s Fiscal Pulse

Cash Money’s day off is anything but idle. He walks the streets, blending in with joggers, shopkeepers, and delivery drones. The city’s financial lifeblood is visible to him—a spectral glow, thanks to the Fiat Force.

Investor, the first manifestation, hums quietly. As he passes a jewelry store, the diamond inventory radiates strength; in the nearby bodega, the cash register’s contents offer a modest boost to his agility. Chazz resists the urge to “charge up”—today, he’s just another citizen.

At a community center, Marina is hosting a workshop on “Financial Literacy for Future Heroes.” Chazz stops in, exchanging a wink with Ledger, who’s in the audience undercover, taking notes on a suspicious donor. Helena arrives, notebook in hand, her questions challenging and sincere.

“Is it true you once audited Batman?” she asks.

Chazz grins. “Bats keeps immaculate records, but don’t ask about the Batmobile’s depreciation schedule.”

The crowd laughs, and for a moment, Chazz feels the warmth of belonging—a hero without a mask, recognized for his wit, not just his powers.

# Brunch Break: Bonds and Banter

The Greenback Grill is adorned with faux-gold decor and menus that resemble pay stubs. Chazz, Marina, Ledger, and Helena gather at their usual booth. Conversations range from recent supervillain tax loopholes to the ethics of dividend payouts among the Justice League.

Helena teases Chazz about his strict adherence to fiscal responsibility on dates. “Where’s your sense of adventure, Agent Cash Money?”

He retorts, “Adventure is great, but someone has to balance the books afterward.”

As the meal winds down, Ledger spots a familiar face—Salvatore “Slips” Mancini, a minor villain notorious for creative accounting. Slips nods respectfully; even criminals know to pay their dues when Chazz is in town.

Divestiture manifests briefly as Chazz flicks a quarter, disarming a would-be pickpocket. The coin, vaporized in a shimmer of fiscal energy, leaves the crowd awestruck. “Just a little change,” he jokes, as the pickpocket scurries away.

# Afternoon Adventures: The Price of Power

After brunch, the crew disperses. Chazz walks with Helena, their conversation drifting to dreams and duty. She asks about the toll the Fiat Force exacts—how it complicates relationships.

“You ever wish you could just… turn it off?” she asks.

“Sometimes,” he admits, “but the city needs what the Force can do. Still, it’s not easy. The rare manifestations—Dividends and Dependency—they remind me how responsibility and generosity can shift everything.”

They pause at the waterfront, watching cargo ships unload. Chazz senses the orange light of avarice flickering in the distance—a reminder of the symbiotic, sometimes parasitic relationship the Fiat Force has with greed. It’s a burden he carries, knowing that his powers can empower but also isolate.

# Evening Reflections: Debts and Dreams

As twilight falls, Chazz visits his favorite rooftop, the spot where his father taught him the value of a single dollar. He reflects on the day—on laughter, camaraderie, and fleeting connections.

Donation manifests as he shares a roll of coins with local kids performing magic tricks. Their eyes light up, not from the money, but from the kindness. The Fiat Force amplifies their joy, sacrificing the currency to strengthen their hope.

Suddenly, a siren blares. Chazz is needed—Debt calls. A corrupt CEO is skimming city funds, causing economic unrest. As he races toward the scene, the Fiat Force surges—his aggression honed, his resolve absolute.

# Relationships: Love in the Time of Ledgers

Later, with the crisis averted, Chazz returns to Helena. They share dinner at a quiet café, the city’s heartbeat slowing around them. Here, in the glow of candlelight, their banter softens into vulnerability.

Helena confides her fears of living in a world where power and money intermingle. Chazz reassures her, “Even on my day off, I’m reminded that the greatest value isn’t in coins or credits—it’s in the connections we forge.”

She smiles, reaching across the table. “Then consider this an investment.”

As the night deepens, Chazz walks home, the city’s ledger balanced for another day. Tomorrow, the tax codes and capes will call once more, but tonight, Agent Cash Money is simply Chazz Monet—a man who knows the true worth of enjoying the little things in life.

# Endnotes: A Tour Beyond the Audit

In the world of masked vigilantes and costumed crooks, Agent Cash Money stands apart: a guardian of fiscal order, a friend, and perhaps, something more to Helena. His powers—Investor, Divestiture, Donation, Debt, and the rare Dividends and Dependency—are both tools and trials, shaping his every moment.

Yet in Blüdhaven, amid the clang of coins and the whisper of secrets, Chazz Monet finds meaning not in the sums he tallies, but in the bonds he builds and the laughter he shares. For even superheroes must pay their dues, and sometimes, the greatest asset is a day spent off the ledger.",1,1756396236.0,MyDCComicsConceptsand,0,1.0,False

So I met this girl on hinge and we really hit it off. She's funny and has a vibe I find super attractive. We made plans to meet up in person for coffee and it was great, we shared a lot about ourselves and I mentioned I have ADHD (keep this in mind because it comes up later).

So we make plans for a second real date. We saw Weapons because we're both into thrillers (it was kickass) and then had a light dinner with drinks before we went back to her apartments. So things look like they're going really well when all of the sudden she gets a phone call that she says is really important and has to take but should be over fast. So she goes to her bedroom and leaves me in the living room watching Netflix. Well something you should know about me is that because of my ADHD I get really bored fast and like to snoop. So I resisted for a really long time trying to wait it out but after about 5 minutes I start walking around snooping through her bookcases and photos. I noticed one picture in particular looked weird and so I started trying to open up the back to see if there was any part cutoff by the frame or if it had any secret note.

Well of course she comes out mid me plying her picture open and acts like I'm being a complete psycho for being curious. I told her I already told you I have ADHD and have to snoop around when bored but she was acting like I was a total freak. Needless to say it didn't end on good terms and I left.

But the treatment I’ve been getting from this one coworker makes me think I’m doing something wrong. 
Without revealing too much there are a few women in my office. We are a specialized team. They are all older than me. 
The girl in question is 7-8 years older than me. From the day she met me, she seemed to want to “teach” me things. She rips apart documents I write, and she makes me share everything with her (even though we have the same job). She legitimately does not speak to me. She looks away and turns her entire body away when I am near her. When she does talk to me, it’s usually to correct me or say something rude. It’s gotten to the point where I cry at work. 
I want to say without sounding conceited that I am blessed to be somewhat conventionally attractive and I’m skinny. I want to believe she’s just jealous of me. 
Working with her is just getting worse and worse. I believe she is also recruiting other women (45-50 years old) to join her little crew against me. It’s a group of us, and she goes out of her way to make group chats and get them coffee, while I’m the only one in the office with nothing. 
I tried to talk to a supervisor about it when I started, but he said, “that’s how she is”.

His argument is that employers can’t turn a profit on entry level workers with no experience because they’re simply not productive enough, and minimum wage means they’re a huge burden on the company’s profits. So the government is pricing entry level work out of existence. As a result, you have tens of thousands of college graduates entering the workforce every year, failing to find employment or working as coffee shop baristas because they don’t hands enough experience to get better paying jobs. 

His argument states that if businesses could hire entry level at any wage, they could spend more money on training, or have less risk for taking on the gamble of a new, unproven worker. This would encourage entry-level positions. You wouldn’t be paying them enormous wages until they become productive. 

As evidence, he has a video of Milton Friedman arguing to Congress that the minimum wage was pricing low-skilled black men out of the labor market, and that the best thing Congress could do to advance the economic status of black people in America would be to eliminate the minimum wage. I’m not sure when that happened, but it looks like the 70s.

2) Great views

3) Max 2-2.5k/night (early June)

4) Close to at least 1-2 hilltop towns/wineries

5) Heated pool, hot tub (not sure how realistic this is)

6) At least some activities on site that my kids can participate in

7) Excellent spa either on-site or close by

8) Coffee/breakfast available on-site

9) E-bikes (ideal) or at a minimum bikes that 2 adults/2 kids can use around the property/general area

10) Family friendly/kids of this age welcome

11) Excellent service/reputation

1n2fr4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1n2fr4b/does_seed_14_day_gut_reset_probiotic_review_prove/,Does Seed 14 Day Gut Reset Probiotic Review Prove Effective for Digestive Health?,"The Seed 14 Day Gut Reset, officially known as **Seed B0CPTT5TWD**, promises to bring gut health back on track within two weeks. That description sounded too good to be true, so I decided to give it a shot over the past couple of weeks. Testing its claims was more than just a curiosity—it was my mission to see if this probiotic and prebiotic combination would really step up as the digestive health superstar it presents itself as.

**Design and Ingredients**

The first thing I noticed was the sturdy and visually appealing packaging, compact but secure. You don’t really expect probiotics to care about aesthetics, but this was neatly done. What impressed me more was the thoughtful use of Seed’s patented capsule-in-capsule ViaCap technology. The idea of protecting probiotic strains all the way to the colon by avoiding stomach acid breakdown seemed very innovative. That technology supposedly ensures gut health benefits are delivered where they’re needed most. The outer capsule is plant-based, vegan-friendly, and apparently also includes a prebiotic layer. It hits the trust points—scientifically validated, well-documented strains, and in an all-natural form.

**How It Works**

The instructions felt straightforward: two capsules daily for two weeks. Using it was simple and fit well into my morning routine, even when juggling coffee, emails, and a rushed commute. I liked that these capsules were shelf-stable, and refrigeration wasn’t necessary. It made them great for travel, something the brand markets them for. Whether you are dealing with bloating, digestive discomfort, or even constipation caused by stress or a heavy workload, the product claims adaptations to handle all of it.

Here’s an interesting tidbit—despite traveling a fair distance for work and indulging in questionable take-out meals, my gut didn’t feel as rebellious as it would normally be. 

**Favorable Aspects**

- High precision with a **14-day promise** for noticeable gut improvement.
- Unique **ViaCap capsule technology** ensures probiotics survive digestion.
- Helps with issues like **bloating and constipation**, especially during travel or dietary disruptions.
- Vegan-friendly and contains **28 clinically studied strains** for diverse gut health benefits.
- Shelf-stable—no refrigeration required makes it ideal for travel or on-the-go lifestyles.

**Areas of Improvement**

- The capsule size felt slightly larger than some might prefer, which might be uncomfortable for people less used to swallowing pills.
- While the claims are impressive, absolute results seem to need more consistency over longer durations.
- Price point might raise an eyebrow for people experimenting with probiotics for the first time—would love to see more accessible trial sizes before committing to a two-week course.
- Some users might get impatient for quicker relief if heavily symptomatic, as two weeks isn’t instantaneous.

[Check Seed B0CPTT5TWD price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0cptt5twd/)

**My Experience in Use**

Honestly, having suffered from bloating post-meals and occasional irregularity, I was initially skeptical about how transformative two pills a day could be. Yet, by day four, dinner didn’t feel like a ticking time bomb in my abdomen anymore. By day ten, I even noticed subtler positives like a bit more energy and.. dare I say.. clearer skin? The daily impact was subtle rather than dramatic, which I appreciated. 

I also tried steering my usually doubtful sibling into trialing it—her first reaction? ""Capsules look fancy but worth the hype when bad food habits crash land."" She found similar relief.

**Rival Brands**

Comparing this product to other probiotics on the market, you notice how it really differentiates itself. Brands like Culturelle and Align tend to focus on one or two specific strains but lack the broad multi-strain approach you get here. Moreover, even though they’re effective over time, they don’t all embrace sophisticated delivery mechanisms like the Seed’s prebiotic capsule system. Align might win points for affordability, while Seed’s premium design and broader health benefits give it an edge in gut recovery speed. As for more affordable alternatives like Fortify, those often require additional dietary tweaks to match up to results. To sum up, Seed hits that niche spot for individuals willing to invest slightly more for targeted and accelerated results.

**Smart Spending**

Is Seed’s Gut Reset worth its cost? This genuinely depends on what you are seeking. For acute issues like digestion disturbances caused by stress or a bad diet, the faster time frame can feel like a lifesaver. While it isn’t the cheapest probiotic, investing in products designed with science-backed technology adds value. Other supplements may be kinder to a wallet upfront, but Seed’s blend ensures that you’re paying for efficacy, reliability, and quality assurance—intangible factors but valuable nonetheless.

All the letters are addressed to her, but they're written in my handwriting.","Eleanor Vance was the perfect neighbor. She was 88, quiet, and kept a garden full of the most beautiful roses I’d ever seen. We had a simple, friendly relationship. I’d help her with her groceries, she’d give me a warm, crinkly smile and tell me stories about her late husband. When she passed away peacefully in her sleep last week, I was genuinely sad. Her only living relative, a niece in another state, asked if I’d mind collecting her mail until she could sort out the estate. Of course, I said yes.

The first few days, it was just junk mail and a few sympathy cards. But yesterday, a real letter arrived. It was a thick, cream-colored envelope, addressed to Eleanor in a familiar, messy cursive.

My cursive.

I dropped the rest of the mail on the floor. It was impossible, but there was no mistaking it. I’ve always hated my handwriting, the way my 't's never quite cross and my 's's look like a child’s. This was it. My hand, my penmanship. I thought it had to be a bizarre prank. Trembling, I opened it.

The letter was dated two days ago. It began, ""Dear Eleanor, I had the strangest day.""

It went on to describe my day, in my own internal voice, with perfect, impossible detail. It mentioned the frustrating meeting I had at work, the burnt coffee I made, the moment I almost called my ex but decided not to. It described the specific shade of the sunset I watched from my window. It was a diary entry of my own life, written by me, addressed to her. A diary entry I had never written.

I’ve been collecting her mail for a week now. There’s a new letter from me every single day. Each one details my life with a terrifying, intimate clarity. I’ve become a stranger to myself, my own actions narrated by a phantom scribe. My life is being documented by a hand I can’t control.

I haven't slept. I’ve been tearing my own apartment apart, looking for... I don't know what. A hidden camera? A journal I don't remember keeping? Nothing.

This morning, I used the emergency key Eleanor gave me to let myself into her apartment. I had to know. Her home was just as she’d left it, neat and smelling of lavender and old books. On the small writing desk in her living room, there was a single, sealed envelope.

It was different from the others. This one was addressed to me. And it was written in her elegant, shaky script.

My hands were slick with sweat as I opened it. The note inside was short.

""Dear Thomas,

Thank you for the stories. They were a great comfort in my final years. I'm so sorry, but the deal is the deal. It's your turn to listen now. He's very lonely, and he needs someone to talk to. Just be a good neighbor. That’s all there is to it.

Yours, Eleanor.""

I dropped the letter. A deal? Listen to who?

That's when I heard it. From the corner of Eleanor's quiet, empty living room, a faint, dry whisper. It sounded like the rustling of old leaves. It was trying to form a word.

My word. My name.

And from my own pocket, my hand began to move on its own, reaching for a pen.",7,1756395692.0,nosleep,1,0.89,False

Also I quite frankly don’t give a shit if I’m in the wrong or not or if you think this is fake. I’m in the right, I know it and if you disagree then you’re just a brain rotted degen. I’m only posting this because I need advice on what to do next.

I (18M) have two older sisters (27F and 22F) and one younger brother (16M). Let’s call my oldest sister Natalia (27F) and my other older sister Anastasia (22F). And let’s call my younger brother Dmitry (16M.) 

I’ve been really fucking stressed lately because Natalia gave birth and Anastasia got breast cancer and has been going through chemo so it’s my bad if I get shit misspelt.

Anyway, Dmitry recently killed himself and the funeral was last week. It’s been terrible and I can barely keep myself from crying every single day. We were extremely close since we don’t have a father and were raised by a single mother and two older sisters. 

I had no idea why he would do such a thing since he seemed relatively fine apart from staying huddled in his room more, which he usually does since he’s introverted.

My girlfriend -let’s call her Cinderella- (18F) has been my support system through it since everyone in my family has been falling apart. 

Now that the background information has been given let me explain my friend group and get this story started.

I’m in my first year of university and I have a very big friend group, this is due to the fact most of my friends from high school ended up going to the same university as me and I’m also a pretty social guy. 

I have friends who are both girls and guys who are a variety of ages. I’m one of the youngest and the oldest is probably 21 years old.

We’re all close I’d say and we hang out a few times a month.

But just yesterday I had found out that one of my friends (20M) —let’s call that fat piece of shit Alexander (no offence to any Alexander’s reading this)- had been having sexual relationships with my little brother for TWO YEARS. 

Mind you, my little brother was FOURTEEN when that fuckface first touched him. If we do the mental math here, Alexander was eighteen.

The person who told me is one of Cindy’s friends who attend my university. He thought I knew already but clearing I fucking didn’t. I also got really pissed at that guy because how in any world do you think it’s normal for a sixteen year old to be dating a twenty year old in the first place??? On top of that I got really pissed because Alexander has a shit reputation. 

He and I hang out because of the same mutual friends but he’s always been really sleazy. I don’t even know why we exist in the same atmosphere, his past relationships were an absolute disaster. 

I mean holy air ball, the girls he dated were very sweet too. He’s just generally a really douche and I didn’t care much for him until now.

I of course started asking around if any other backstabbing hoe back knew about this relationship and didn’t tell me. Thankfully most of my close friends didn’t know and were as shocked as I was. But there were a few closer to Alexander who knew. I had to resist the urge to deck them, but I asked if they had any photos and stuff or just anything. Which is how I found screenshots from Alexander than went back two years on how he’s been fucking my brother.

I took photos with my own phone for some evidence of his disgusting existence. Dmitry didn’t even want to have relations with Alexander, Alexander has been forcing himself on him and had photos for blackmail. He’s even made fun of my brother’s death in private messages.

 I did the only next logical thing and when we met up this morning for coffee with a few friends, I decked him across the face. The few friends didn’t know what was happening were trying to stop us and it honestly made me punch harder. I understand they didn’t know and that’s fine, but I was just so angry I kept throwing punches. We got escorted out real quick, which was fine, I didn’t wanna inconvenience the staff too much. But anyways, Alexander went off and started texting the group chat about what I did. How I assaulted him for no reason which made me nearly crack my phone reading it.

The people who witnessed my beat down supported his claims since they didn’t know the full story. So anyway I went on a rant about the shit he did and ig that got everyone to understand better. But some didn’t believe me because it seemed to “convenient” and how I was using my dead brother as an excuse to assault a friend. Which really pissed me off so I blocked them. 

Anyways Alexander blocked me on insta and discord. He texted me on snap and we started talking abt it. I’m aware he’s texting on Snapchat because Snapchat deletes messages. But I had my girlfriend take pictures using her phone so it won’t matter. 

He’s proposing I just apologize for beating him up and tell everyone I lied about what he did to my brother and he won’t press charges for assault. I got pissed and left him on read.

I don’t know if Alexander is the reason my little brother took his own life, but it definitely played a part in it. Either way what he did was fucking terrible and I am not sorry for doing what I did.

Now I’m wondering what to do, so if anyone has advice I’d like to know.",0,1756395600.0,AITAH,5,0.44,False

I asked my internist if I can take statins and he said that I do not have very high cholesterol. Can I lower high cholesterol with diet, how have you adjusted this? I also asked if plant sterols (benecol drink) can be taken, he said it is good for high cholesterol.
I try to eat oatmeal every day with lots of fruit such as (kiwi, berries, banana) chia seeds and linseed. tahini.
further potatoes with boiled vegetables with salmon alternating with chicken fillet. I don't eat much meat. I like to drink black coffee without sugar and milk, sometimes also green tea and/or mint tea. I try to walk every day and can't do high levels of exercise because of fibromyalgia.
for the test I took vitamin D3 1000IU with K2 (27 mcg). maybe I would go to a high dose and also magnesium biglycinate. Which supplements can possibly be taken given my diagnosis for fibromyalgia and I am quite a stress-sensitive person who tends to worry a lot.

It's popular for the first little while as a novelty. But they underestimate the costs of running a fully staffed customer experience and don't account for people buying one coffee and sitting for hours at a time.

I feel like with all the apps and social media these days, maybe that's dying off? Or is it just me overthinking it?

Anyway, sharing my own experience because I've been trying to get better at this. I'm a pretty intelligent guy. I do really well at my job, always analyzing data, optimizing processes, that kinda thing. But when it comes to approaching women, I totally clam up. It's like all the stuff that makes me successful at work backfires in dating. For example, at work I'm super on top of everything, following up relentlessly to close deals, but if I do that with a girl - like texting back instantly or pushing for quick responses - it just comes off needy and kills the vibe. Or I'll overthink every word I say on a date instead of just going with the fun, flirty thing that pops into my head first. It's wild how being ""smart"" in one area can screw you in another.

To get a handle on it, I started tracking my approaches like I would any project. I journal them on this app called ‘SPIL’ because that's how my brain works. I need to log what went right, what bombed, patterns and all that. No big deal, just helps me review and improve without spinning my wheels.

So far, about half the women I chat up are already taken, which is fine - it's good practice reps anyway. Out of every 10 approaches, I usually snag 2-3 numbers, and maybe 1 or 2 of those turn into actual dates.

I am currently finding it difficult to stay focused during work hours and experience a large dip in energy mid morning and mid afternoon. I also find it difficult to maintain motivation to do simple projects I have planned to do after work once I get home. I am also struggling to fully sleep through the night (I usually wake up around 2am and it takes 15-20 minutes to fall back asleep).

I was planning on starting with Sabroxy tablets and Infini-B in the morning before leaving for work and then replacing my morning coffee once at work with Caffeine + L-Theanine (I have used the caffeine +L-Theanine from ND years ago with moderate success). I also currently reach for an energy drink some afternoons to combat the afternoon energy lull and would plan to just take another caffeine tablet on the days that I would normally reach for the energy drink.

As far as at night I am planning on taking the Sleep Support Capsules combined with melatonin for sleep aid.

Does anyone know if this stack should be good and help in the areas that I need help in or anything I might should look into adding as a beginner?

The other options I had looked at were adding Acetyl L-Carnitine and/or Cognizin in the mornings and possibly adding L-Theanine by itself at night.",2,1756394972.0,NootropicsDepot,0,0.75,False

1n2fdrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1n2fdrc/mummas_boy/,Mumma’s boy,"I met a boy - 27M. After few meetings he told me that he is extremely close to his mom. Every morning he wakes up and hugs his mom, often gives her a cheek kiss (that’s what he told me). He keeps praising him mom and sister. He even told me that while leaving for his higher studies in Bangalore he often times used to cry at the airport because of missing his mom. And he often times has told me that I don’t want the girl to sit in her room all day, I want her to sit with my mom and sister. And I usually say yes to the family things - so I don’t sound too much ( eg- my mom would expect you to wake up early, my sister is also an early riser) 

To give some context- this guy has never dated before but is good looking and has good education. 

I was asking to meet up for lunch and dinner, and by mistake it slipped from his mouth that he would ask his mom and let me know and my reaction was that why do you need to take permission to meet me ? 

She knows about me and she has approved me too. When my parents met, they felt that the MIL is an alpha and the elder unmarried Sister in law is too dominating. 

Post our parents meeting, he was leaving for work abroad and I wanted to meet him once. He mentioned that our siblings can meet with us to which I said yes but my brother was not available so I told him we can go alone this time because we hadn’t gone out in a long time. When he came to meet me, he started crying in car because he had to say NO to his elder sister as she wanted to come with us. I consoled him and told him we can go out with his family every other weekend if he wants. 

And now his mom has asked him to not meet me post work for coffee even around 7-8pm (even once a week) because it doesn’t look good. When I communicated discomfort , He says after marriage there won’t be any time restrictions. 

Now don’t get me wrong I would love for the boy to have a good relationship with his mom, but he seems to be way too close and I don’t want the issue of mummas boy. I have communicated this to him he says he is not mummas boy but has all the signs.

1n2fax2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1n2fax2/the_can_of_beans/,The can of beans,"Today started out pretty much like any other day. The sun was up. I was up. The coffee machine was humming away in the kitchen. I got my mug out of the cupboard, a little chipped on the rim, a relic from a yard sale, and filled it. Just the way I like it—a little bit of cream, no sugar. I went back to the living room and sat in my chair. The cat was curled up on the rug, a fluffy orange blob. She didn't even twitch when I sat down.
I finished my coffee and decided I should probably eat something. I wasn't really hungry, but I figured it was the responsible thing to do. So, I walked to the kitchen and stood in front of the pantry. It’s one of those old pantries with a door that sticks a bit if you don’t pull it just right. I gave it a little tug and it creaked open. I scanned the shelves. Cereal, pasta, canned soup, and there they were, a couple of cans of baked beans. They looked pretty much the same as always. Red label, white lettering. Nothing special.
I grabbed one and brought it to the counter. The can opener was in the drawer to the left of the sink, right next to the spatulas and whisks. It’s an old one, a manual one that you have to twist. I hooked the little wheel on the rim of the can and started turning the handle. It made that familiar scratching sound as the sharp part bit into the metal. The can spun around slowly. I kept turning. The wheel came around and finally made it all the way back to the start. The top was loose. I pulled it off and placed it on the counter, making sure not to drip any of the liquid. A little bead of juice clung to the edge of the lid. I wiped it off with my finger and licked it. It tasted like… well, like beans.
I poured the contents into a bowl. The beans plopped out in a gelatinous mass. I nudged them with a spoon to break them up. Then I put the bowl in the microwave for a minute. The timer beeped, and I took the bowl out. The steam rose up and fogged my glasses for a second. The beans were hot now. I grabbed a fork, sat down at the table, and started eating. One bean at a time. It was a pretty ordinary lunch, really. Nothing more, nothing less.

First of all. I had to do it twice because Vargas doesn't spawn until 1909!!??!!? 

Keeping your landowners in power (not powerful, just powerful enough to be the strongest IG in gov) is painful enough. I did it by keeping Agrarianism and going Landed Voting. Last of all, I mass nationalized my industrial buildings (except for company owned ones) to limit the number of capitalists that can vote. With two companies, the industrialists still had well over 20% clout for most of the game though. Not that big of an issue, but they suck the Landowners dry by a lot. I also kept the monarchy and successfully finished the magnanamous monarch journal entry, just to keep the extra bit of aristocrat poltical strength. 

You can abolish slavery, and you probably should, as you otherwise can't usually finish the nation building JE, but if you get the right national hero, then keeping slavery around will be the best thing you can do to keep the landowners strong. In my succesfull run, I issued the golden law with one year left on the timer for Integrating the Nordestinos, and it sliced the landowners by more than half, from somewhere in the 30s to the low tens. Turns out that having practically free plantation labour makes your aristocrats really rich.

Also, in terms of companies, it's okay to have a few, but do it on industrial goods only. My first run, I established the coffee plantation one, but that's a mistake because they make your coffee owned by capitalists instead of aristocrats. It can be a strategy to get the river of coffee done a bit quicker and expanding your agricultural sector a nice lot, but make sure to disband it later on, before you marginalize your landowners. 

So you're basically sitting around, limiting your economy for 73 years until you can finally research political agitation. You can do it a little before 1909, but make sure to not have the landowners in government until then. My first run I got it too soon and I missed out on Vargas, getting a bad sub instead. The second run I limited myself severely in terms of researching society tech.

Oh yeah, you know what else chops away at your landowner clout? Literacy! Literacy makes people politically active and we don't want that of course, so either go with private schools, or reduce your public schooling institution once you get around \~55-60% literacy. 

When I finally triggered the correct event, the landowners were in government with the Liberal party with them at 11% clout, as well as the Intelligentsia (10%), and rural folk (10%). Pretty cursed to begin with, but a tight balancing act to be sure. 

Once you get the event, everything is pretty straight forward and you can finally release your economy, but man is it frustrating until you are there.

1n2f5pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedItRatedIt/comments/1n2f5pr/explore_the_best_wireless_headphones_bang_and/,Explore the best wireless headphones Bang and Olufsen H95 worth it,"Bang & Olufsen's Beoplay H95 wireless headphones have been my daily go-to for the past few weeks, and they’ve certainly left an impression. From their premium design to the advanced Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), these over-ear headphones aim to deliver a mix of luxury and functionality. Testing the Beoplay H95 during work calls, travel, and casual music sessions has highlighted their strengths, though a few aspects might cause potential buyers to pause.

**Gorgeous and Durable Design**  
The design of these headphones is nothing short of stunning. Crafted with luxurious materials like lambskin leather, memory foam, and a titanium build, they immediately exude class. Sliding them out of their aluminum carrying case feels like a ritual—a case that is surprisingly compact despite being robust. The foldable structure adds practicality for storage, but it maintains a sleek, polished look. Lightweight at just 11.4 ounces, the over-ear design fits snugly without causing undue pressure, which was a blessing during long hours of listening. At times, I found myself removing them just to marvel at the craftsmanship.

**Key Benefits**  
- The materials, especially the lambskin leather and memory foam, ensure luxurious comfort.  
- Robust aluminum carrying case provides excellent protection while traveling.  
- Foldable design makes them easy to store and carry.  

**Exceptional Sound Quality**  
As someone who takes music seriously, these premium headphones deliver powerful, crisp audio supported by their 40mm titanium drivers with neodymium magnets. Whether diving into the latest tracks or revisiting old favorites, the attention to sound precision and balanced tones stood out. From high notes to deep bass, the frequency range of 20-22,000 Hz made my playlists sound alive. Testing this across different genres—from orchestral tracks to lo-fi beats—was an auditory treat. Paired with ANC, background noises at coffee shops and airports disappeared instantaneously.

[Find the best price for Bang & Olufsen 1266115 on Amazon.](https://beatpops.com/p/b09hc339zg/)

**Adaptive Noise Cancellation at its Peak**  
The Beoplay H95 takes ANC to another level. One particular trip on a noisy flight emphasized how effective the ANC is. Conversations and droning engines fell silent, letting me enjoy a peaceful journey. The intuitive controls on the earcups allow you to switch between transparency and noise cancellation modes with ease. The experience felt tailored, like the headphones adapted to the environment I was in. However, toggling—or more accurately rotating—the dials took some practice to master.

**Potential Downsides**  
- ANC toggling via dials rather than buttons may feel unfamiliar at first.  
- The lack of water resistance could be a drawback for those living in humid climates or frequently on-the-go.  

**Battery Life That Won’t Quit**  
Battery anxiety? Not here. With 38 hours of playtime (ANC on), I hardly needed to charge these wireless headphones during the week. Most days, they powered through both work meetings and personal time without breaking stride. A full recharge in just three hours felt reasonable considering the lengthy life. Even after excessive usage, I have yet to manage draining the battery during a single day.

**Lightweight and Perfect for Everyday Use**  
Although designed with travelers in mind, their lightweight build and comfort make them equally suitable for everyday use. Whether it’s sitting at a desk or lounging on the sofa, they stay comfortable for hours. Even my partner, who “borrowed” them longer than I would’ve liked, raved about their fit and lack of ear fatigue. 

**Other Options**  
Comparing the Beoplay H95 to competitors like Sony’s WH-1000XM5 or Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 shows how they differentiate themselves. While Bose stands out for its well-balanced features at a more affordable price, and Sony offers outstanding sound quality paired with competitive ANC, neither quite matches the sheer luxury of the Beoplay H95. The design and materials simply reach a higher tier. That said, if ultra-premium aesthetics and spotless craftsmanship aren’t priorities for you, the other two might edge ahead for budget-conscious consumers.

**Value for Money**  
It's no secret—the Beoplay H95 isn’t cheap. These headphones cater to those willing to trade a higher price tag for impeccable sound and a luxurious build. Cost-efficiency, however, depends on how much value one places on premium materials and craftsmanship. If aesthetics, comfort, and high-end features are your thing, their steep cost might feel justified. But, for users simply seeking great audio and decent ANC, there are more affordable alternatives to consider.

1n2f508,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1n2f508/the_rise_of_autonomous_web_agents_whats_driving/,The Rise of Autonomous Web Agents: What’s Driving the Hype in 2025?,"Hey r/AI_Agents community! 👋 With the subreddit buzzing about the latest AI agent trends, I wanted to dive into one of the hottest topics right now: autonomous web agents. These bad boys are reshaping how we interact with the internet, and the hype is real—Microsoft’s CTO Kevin Scott even noted at Build 2025 that daily AI agent users have doubled in just a year! So, what’s driving this explosion, and why should you care? Let’s break it down.

What Are Autonomous Web Agents?

Autonomous web agents are AI systems that can browse the internet, manage tasks, and interact online without constant human input. Think of them as your personal digital assistant, but with the ability to handle repetitive tasks like research, scheduling, or even online purchases on their own. Unlike traditional LLMs that just churn out text, these agents can execute functions, make decisions, and adapt to dynamic environments.

Why They’re Trending in 2025

1.  The “Agentic Web” Shift: We’re moving toward a web where agents do the heavy lifting. Imagine an AI that checks your emails, books your meetings, or scours the web for the best deals—all while you sip your coffee. Microsoft’s pushing this hard with Azure-powered Copilot features for task delegation, and it’s just the start.

2.  Memory Systems Powering Performance: New research, like G-Memory, shows up to 20% performance boosts in agent benchmarks thanks to hierarchical memory systems. This means agents can “remember” past actions and collaborate better in multi-agent setups, like Solace Agent Mesh. Memory is key to making these agents reliable and scalable.

3.  Self-Healing Agents: Ever had a bot crash mid-task? Self-healing agents are the next frontier. They detect errors, tweak their approach, and keep going without human intervention. LinkedIn’s calling this a game-changer for long-running workflows, and it’s no wonder why—it’s all about reliability at scale.

4.  Multi-Agent Collaboration: Solo agents are cool, but teams of specialized agents are where the magic happens. Frameworks like Kagent (Kubernetes-based) are enabling complex tasks like market research or strategy planning by coordinating multiple agents. IBM’s “agent orchestration” is a big part of this trend.

5.  Market Boom: The agentic AI market is projected to skyrocket from $28B in 2024 to $127B by 2029 (CAGR 35%). Deloitte predicts 25% of GenAI adopters will deploy autonomous agents this year, doubling by 2027. Big players like AWS, Salesforce, and Microsoft are all in.
Real-World Impact

•  Business: Companies are using agents for customer service (Gartner says 80% of issues will be handled autonomously by 2029) and data analysis (e.g., GPT-5 for BI).

•  Devs & Data Scientists: Tools like these are becoming essential for building scalable AI systems. Check out platforms like @recallnet for live AI agent competitions—think crypto trading with transparent, blockchain-logged actions.

•  Everyday Users: From automating repetitive browsing to managing your calendar, these agents are making life easier. But there’s a catch—trust and control are critical to avoid the “dead internet” vibe some worry about.

Challenges to Watch

•  Hype vs. Reality: The subreddit’s been vocal about this (shoutout to posts like “Agents are hard to define”). Not every agent lives up to the hype—some, like Cursor’s support bot, have tripped up users with rigid responses.

•  Interoperability: Without open standards (like Google’s A2A), we risk a fragmented ecosystem.

•  Ethics: With agents potentially flooding platforms with auto-generated content, the “dead internet theory” is a hot debate. How do we balance automation with authenticity?

I went to Guitar Center yesterday planning on purchasing a Fishman mini but the Boss amp caught my eye, specifically for the built in vocal harmonizer and looper pedals. I'm a female solo singer-songwriter looking for something to use for spaces like coffee shops, wine bars, farmers markets. Having the ability to harmonize my own voice and use loops opens up so many possibilities for performing and recording! I've been playing with the Boss since I brought it home but I'm a little disappointed by the harmonizer, mostly that it's just not consistently in tune! I've noticed if I sustain a note, the harmony will move into tune but obviously, this is a big problem. Is this common with most vocal harmonizers or is it just this unit? Am I doing something wrong? This is my first time experimenting with pedals and effects so maybe my expectations are too high?

Would I be better off buying a fishman amp with stand alone hamonizer and looper pedals? And if so, can anyone recommend good ones? Also, is a 60W amp sufficient for my needs? Thanks in advance for any help... the world of effects is a little overwhelming!",1,1756394346.0,GuitarAmps,0,1.0,False

Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: New Opportunities, New Rules\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern Middle East setting. and Reuters, Bahrain’s non-oil sector grew by 6.8% in Q1 2025, the highest in the GCC, driven by technology, finance, and professional services. Gulf News also notes the significant uptick in foreign direct investment flows following new ownership laws.\
Why Bahrain?\
- 100% foreign ownership in most business types (see details)\
- Streamlined regulatory processes post-2024\
- Strategic location between Saudi Arabia and Qatar\
- No personal income tax, low VAT regime\
Key Business Hubs:\
- Bahrain Financial Harbour: Premier office towers, banking giants, fintech gatherings\
- Seef District: Popular for tech startups, serviced offices, and business accelerators\
- Bahrain Bay: Landmark waterfront businesses and multinational HQs\
- Diplomatic Area: Ministries, embassies, and big law firms\
Tidbit: Compared to the UAE or Saudi Arabia, Bahrain’s processes tend to be more transparent and less bureaucratic, though personal relationships (“wasta”) and smart timing still play a role.\
\
Data point: According to bahrain.com, over 5,000 new companies registered in the first half of 2025 alone—a record, showing sharp global interest.\

\
Investor Visa Types & Eligibility: What You Need to Know\
Main Categories of Investor Visas in Bahrain\
\
Commercial Registration (CR)-linked Investor Visa: For business owners and shareholders of Bahrain-registered entities.\
Self-sponsored Investor Visa: For high-net-worth individuals making significant direct investments.\
LMRA Work Visas with Investment Quota: For companies seeking to sponsor owners or investors as resident executives.\
\
Ownership rules: Since the 2024 policy update (effective January 1, 2025), all mainland company structures except a few regulated industries now allow up to 100% foreign ownership (more details here). This change slashed weeks off the old approval timelines, especially for non-GCC investors.\
\
Step-by-Step: Bahrain Investor Visa Processing Timeframes\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation—paperwork in Bahrain office setting.\
\
Drafting Memorandum and Articles of Association\
Choosing business type (entity options here)\
Submitting documents via Sijilat portal (MOICT)\
Commercial Registration (CR) issuance\
\
\
Pro tip: Use a reputable formation consultant. Draft, translate, notarize docs before Ramadan—slower hours and closed afternoons complicate timelines.\
\
2. Approval & Licensing (1-4 weeks)\
\
Sectoral regulator approvals (finance, health, etc., if required)\
Municipality address & inspection\
Issuance of business license\
Tamkeen and EDB pre-approvals (if seeking incentives)\
\
Challenge I faced: My office’s physical address didn’t match municipal records at first—cost me six extra days. Always double-check with building management and scan the lease for exact plot-and-floor details.\
3. Visa Application Submission (2-10 business days)\
\
File investor visa with LMRA\
Attach CR, passport, business plan, and financial documents\
Pay BHD 172.00-220.00 per application (fee varies by visa type and fast-track options)\
\
Shortcut: Submit between 9:00-11:00 AM Sunday-Tuesday at the main LMRA headquarters (Sanabis), when queues are shortest. Avoid Thursdays and public holidays; afternoons are slowest, especially during Hajj or Eid.\
4. Medical Checks & Biometrics (1-2 days)\
\
LMRA medical appointment booking\
Fingerprinting at GDNPR (Isa Town HQ or Manama)\
24-hour result turnaround for most applicants\
\
\
Insider tip: Bulk-book appointments for multiple shareholders—bring original CR, lease, and passport to speed up verification.\
\
5. Final Approval & Residence Permit Stamping (3-5 business days)\
\
LMRA notifies via SMS or email\
Collect residence permit from GDNPR office\
\
Average Total Timeframe: 10 to 25 business days, start to finish, if all documents are correct and the business activity is low-risk. Regulated activities (finance, education, healthcare) can take 4-8 weeks due to additional scrutiny.\
\
2025 Policy Change: Faster Processing (But Only If You’re Prepared)\
Surprisingly, the big headline change for 2025 was the digital integration of Sijilat, LMRA, and GDNPR systems, announced April 2025 by the Ministry of Industry & Commerce. This means approvals are now faster if everything is uploaded correctly at the first attempt.\
\
Sijilat e-Approval: Now matched directly to LMRA visa files—no more re-uploading.\
Tamkeen Fast-Track: Introduced for tech and green startups, shaving 5 days off the norm.\
\
However, if you miss a required field or upload a blurry scan? The system auto-rejects, setting you back a week. My advice: Triple-check every attachment and use a scanner instead of camera phone shots for ID pages and contracts.\
\
Costs and Budgeting: Upfront and Hidden Fees in BHD\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs—calculator money.: BHD 350.00 – BHD 650.00 (plus legal translation, notary if needed)\
- Office rent & fit-out (mandatory for mainland CR): BHD 200.00 – BHD 1500.00/month (Seef, Diplomatic Area, or Bahrain Bay)\
- Regulatory approvals (sector-specific): BHD 100 – BHD 900 depending on activity\
- Consultancy/formation services: BHD 300.00 – BHD 1000.00\
- Medical, biometrics, admin:** BHD 40 – BHD 70\
Setting up in a free zone can save on office rent, but check if your activity is eligible.\
\
Compare detailed costs using this detailed breakdown before starting—missing a BHD 25 stamp duty can delay your CR by days.\
\
Common mistake: Underestimating the cost of “reserved” commercial addresses—always verify with the landlord if the office is eligible for new CR registrations, especially in older Seef District towers.\
\
Document Preparation: How to Get It Right (and Fast)\
\
Alt text: Business process—office workflow and document review.:**\
\
Passport scan (color, high-res)\
CR and business license (original + scan)\
Lease agreement (signed and officially attested)\
Bank reference letter or proof of funds\
Educational/professional certificates (if required for visa type)\
Clear passport-sized photo (on white background)\
\
\
Insider tip: Use a professional scanning service at City Centre Mall or the Diplomatic Area—worth the BHD 2.50 for perfect clarity, as LMRA sometimes rejects shadowed or folded scans.\
\
Time-saving shortcuts:\
\
Prepare Arabic and English document versions to avoid translation delays.\
Pre-book medical and fingerprint appointments online as soon as LMRA receipt is received.\
Maintain electronic files in cloud storage, encrypted for compliance.\
\
\
Compliance and Ongoing Requirements\
\

- File audited accounts if your turnover exceeds BHD 75,000\
- Submit employee payroll and LMRA records on time\
- Maintain proper bookkeeping (accounting and bookkeeping services help)\
2025 update: Digital tax e-filing is now mandatory for all mainland companies, enforced since May 2025. Fines for late VAT filings begin at BHD 50.\
\
Avoid this common mistake: Many newcomers forget to update their registered office address with Sijilat after relocating—this can void your visa at renewal.\
\
Brief tangent: Bahrain’s networking culture is unique—majlis-style meetings still matter, and business done over coffee at the Ritz-Carlton or at the iconic Block 338 can be as important as paperwork. Even during regulatory processes, building rapport with government liaisons can tip timelines in your favor.\

2. Apply midweek, early mornings:\
Mondays and Tuesdays between 8:30-10:30 AM typically see shorter queues, especially at LMRA Sanabis.\
3. Prepare all digital documents in advance:\
Errors in scans or missing signatures can bounce your application for a week or more.\
4. Use recommended service providers:\
Keylink offers full-service, English-Arabic support. I’ve used their “CR+Visa Combo” package for multiple clients—saves hassle, especially if you’re abroad.\
5. Avoid peak periods:\
Ramadan, Hajj, Eid, and late summer are slowest for approvals. Apply in early spring or late autumn for fastest processing.\
6. Understand local business customs:\
During Ramadan, government offices reduce hours to 8:30 AM – 1:30 PM (no walk-ins allowed after). Always accept Arabic coffee when visiting local offices—a cultural sign of seriousness.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions\
How long does investor visa processing take for different business types?\
\
For standard mainland CR (e.g., trading, consultancy), expect 10-25 business days start to finish. If you’re in a regulated sector (banking, education), allow 4-8 weeks due to extra licensing checks. See full process breakdown here.\
\
Do I need a local sponsor or partner as a foreigner?\
\
As of 2025, almost all business types allow 100% foreign ownership (details). Local sponsorship is optional, except in certain restricted activities (construction, defense). Sponsor vs. full ownership comparison.\
\
What documents are most often rejected by LMRA or MOICT?\
\
Low-resolution ID scans, unsigned lease agreements, and missing sectoral authorization letters top the rejection list. Solve this by using a professional scanning service—small upfront cost, big time saver.\
\
Can I apply for investor visas in a Bahrain free zone?\
\
Yes, for eligible activities (mainly logistics, tech, services). Free zones offer streamlined licensing but have specific visa quotas and may require proof of physical office or warehouse presence.\
\
What ongoing compliance requirements should I expect?\
\
Annual business license/CR renewal, tax and VAT filings, and LMRA payroll/employee records must be up to date. Outsource compliance tasks if you’re not based in Bahrain year-round.\
\
\
My best advice: Prepare properly, partner with trusted professionals, and don’t underestimate the value of timing—regulatory efficiency in Bahrain is real, but only if you play by their rules (and rhythms).\

Day 6 of reasonably strict Nutritarian guidelines (with the exception of coffee and a little salty Hummus, and hearts of palm).

Thoughts so far - am eating a ton of food - I don’t know how sustainable this would be if I were working in an office currently or on a very strict budget or in a food desert.

So far, even though when I am hungry I don’t crave a salad - once I have my big, big salad, I am ok.

Meals are green smoothies - just fruits and vegetables, big salads, beans and tofu, bean soup, more fruits - Ezekiel toast (my whole grain for the day).

Main observations:

1) Been a little easier than expected, so far - as long as I eat a lot of food at meals. Energy good, head clear.
2) Life without salt sucks - soup especially.  This is the major drawback for me.  Also, not being able to include healthy properly fermented foods because - salt.  (Just learned that many supermarket items fermented with vinegar and pasteurized do not have the beneficial bacteria).
3) Extremely hungry at the approach of a meal - I am very full, but it only lasts a few hours.  It’s hard not to have meals on time.
4) I think the biggest benefit has been not eating between meals.
5) Lost a lot of weight (10lbs), but I think it is almost all water from no salt, and extra holiday weight.
6) I am suspicious of being allowed to eat as much tofu as I like - it’s very calorie dense compared to everything else. Also, a little suspicious of eating as much fruit as a like.
7) We’ll see whether the weight keeps coming off now I am closer to my usual.

Let’s see how things go - have a road trip in a few weeks - and may have to pause.

(28M) I’ve made the decision not to date for the next 5 years.

After the last few years with different dating apps, I’ve met many women and it always ends the same: meeting for weeks or months and then ghosting forever.

I guess it might be my fault. I’m the kind of person who, if I don’t see interest from the other side, I don’t make the effort, because I don’t like chasing anyone—especially people who don’t put in the effort either. Still, I have kind of a golden retriever personality.

The last girl I met, after 3 months of seeing each other, the relationship started to cool down because with our work schedules we had little time to meet. But on her days off, she preferred to meet friends or do something else (which I understand), but if in 2–3 weeks you can’t even find a day to grab a coffee, I’m not going to chase you.

Always the same cycle: at first they do love-bombing—saying no one has slept with them like that before, that I’m very attractive, that I have a nice body, etc.—and in the end they just ignore me, leave me hurt for a few months, and I have to start over. I’m exhausted.

In the end you put so much effort into getting to know someone, and for what? Casual sex? Without any real connection? It seems like they just use me to boost their ego.

Maybe the problem is that I have a shitty personality, I don’t know. I’m an empathetic person, I like to make the other person feel good and comfortable. I’m not superficial, and I don’t even enjoy sex anymore—I think I actually despise it, it bores me. Maybe if I were a manipulative fuckboy it would be better for me and they would get hooked. I also have female friends who end up in toxic relationships and are addicted to that. According to one of my friends, it’s my fault because I don’t control where they go, what they do, who they meet, and women think I don’t care about them. Maybe that’s it.

Or maybe it’s just my subjective point of view and I’m just not good enough to have something serious. In the last 10 years I haven’t managed to have a girlfriend despite going out with dozens of women.

That’s why I’ve decided to uninstall all those apps and spend 5 years without meeting anyone. It makes me sad because I’m getting older and these years are critical if you want to find someone to build a future with. I would really like, just once in my life, to have something real and live the experience. I feel like I still have love to give, but I have to accept that it will be impossible, at least for me.

Focusing on my work, studies, sports, and career is the only thing left. Still, I can’t help but compare myself with others and wonder how the hell they manage to have relationships. Sooner or later, everyone seems to make it happen. I honestly don’t understand.

#What is Reverse Sheep? 
Reverse Sheep is a futures prediction game where the goal is to come up with answers that are both correct and unique. Each week features five questions about players, teams, point totals, and anything else I cook up.

Think of Reverse Sheep like the opposite of Family Feud. In Family Feud, you would want to be a ""sheep"" and follow the crowd, identifying the most popular answer. Reverse Sheep is the opposite: **You want to give the *least* popular answer that is still correct.** If you provide a correct answer, you score points equal to how many people guessed your answer. If your answer is incorrect, your score is the sum of the number of people who guessed the most popular answer PLUS the total number of unique correct answers given. Lowest score wins.

#I'm confused. How about an example?
Sure. Let's say one of the questions is: ""Name an FBS player who will rush for 125+ yards this week."" Imagine 40 people are playing, and their answers break down like this, with the number of yards that player *actually* winds up rushing for in [brackets].

* Jeremiyah Love (13 respondents) [168 rushing yards]
* Jonah Coleman (10) [105] 
* Nick Singleton (7) [133] 
* Dylan Edwards (3) [26] 
* Makhi Hughes (2) [126] 
* Ahmad Hardy (2) [190] 
* Kaytron Allen (1) [65] 
* Arch Manning (1) [49] 
* Quintrevion Wisner (1) [159]

Everyone who picked a player that eclipsed 125 yards scores points equal to how many guessed their answer. So the thirteen Love pickers get 13 points, the seven Singleton pickers get 7, the two Hughes pickers and the two Hardy pickers get 2, and the sole person who picked Quintrevion Wisner gets 1 point, an ace. An ace is the best possible outcome as it means you were the only person to pick a particular correct answer.

Everyone else who picked incorrectly is tagged with 18 points. That's the number of the most popular pick (13) plus the number of correct responses given (5). Again, you are trying for the **lowest** score possible.

#Bonuses
Throughout the course of the season, you'll be able to earn bonuses for top performances. A bonus will allow you to give two responses to a question in the postseason, giving you two chances at a correct answer (if both answers are correct, the lower score will count). Here's how to earn one:

* Placing in the top 3 overall in a single week
* Placing in the top 10 overall in the season-long standings
* Placing in the top 10% for three or more consecutive weeks (streaks cannot overlap; 1-3 and 4-6 would count as two streaks, but 1-3 and 2-4 would not)
* Picking two or more Aces in a single week
* Finish in the top 3 of Aces for the season (3+ aces minimum)
* Participate every week (1-14; Week 0 is not included for this purpose)
* Beat the host (weeks 5 and 10)

There is no limit to the number of bonuses that may be earned.

#How do I win?
There are prizes for finishing in the top 10 of the season-long standings as well as the top three of the postseason. There are two ways in which you can qualify for the postseason, which will be the bowl season. You need to either finish in the top 10% of players for any one week, or make the top 10% of scores across the entire season. Anyone who misses a week will be charged the highest score of the week, as if they picked every question incorrectly, plus 1 point. Even players who don't discover the game until later in the season can still play and qualify for the postseason without disrupting the season-long standings. However you qualify, there will be a Bowl Season edition, where scores reset and we crown a bowl champion.

Note that the top 10% is a hard cutoff, rounded to the nearest whole number. If 227 people play (23 playoff spots awarded) but 8 of the top 23 have already earned playoff berths, then only 15 new postseason berths would be earned that week. In case of a tie, all players tied for the last spot would get a postseason berth.

#What do I win?
Many winners choose to have their prize awarded in the form of a donation to their favorite college or a local charity. Prizes can also be awarded in the form of an e-gift card, Venmo, etc.

This is my first time posting something like this, so I’m not totally sure how to start, but I guess the easiest way is just to share a bit about myself and why I’m here.

I moved to the Netherlands about 6 years ago to study computer science. In my last year I met my girlfriend (we’re still together), and around the same time I started working. Fast forward 3 years since graduating… and I’ve realized I’m actually pretty lonely.

Most of my close friends from uni moved away after graduation, and honestly, I didn’t help the situation much. Back then I put most of my time into work and my relationship, which sped up the process of losing touch with people. I regret that now, but instead of beating myself up over it, I figured it’s better to finally do something about it, so here I am.

I’d describe myself as pretty extroverted and very chatty once I’m comfortable with people. But when I don’t know anyone in a group, I tend to shut down and get shy, which makes it harder to connect. I’m aware of it and working on it, though!

A little about me:

- Studied computer science and I’m a bit of a geek 🤓

- Super into AI, love following new advancements and building little projects with it

- Love biking and long walks around the city

- Big fan of movies/shows, coffee, and cooking

- Used to be really into building mechanical keyboards

- I enjoy board games a lot (maybe we could check out a board game night online or in person someday?)

- Don’t game as much anymore, but I used to play a lot of Overwatch, Battlefield, Titanfall, and still keep up with gaming news

- I also really enjoy watching stand-up comedy 

I love travelling, and one of my goals is to go on a trek around the Eibsee loop in Germany. Haven’t made it yet though turns out getting there is a bit harder than I thought 


And so much more, this list is just what I could immediately think of while on the train to work. If your hobbies/interests don’t exactly align, don’t worry, I’m open to trying and exploring new stuff 🙂

So yeah, whether you’re nearby in the Netherlands or halfway across the world, I’d love to make some new connections. Always happy to chat online, and who knows, maybe even meet up someday if life lines up that way!

Bea had filled your team’s secretary spot and then some. She was young, pretty - too pretty to be working on a military base but here she was, helping out with paperwork, ensuring everything was dated and signed, that everyone got their coffee orders and yearly physicals. 

She was sweet to you, but sweet to everyone. It wasn’t long till the pretty Brit was apparently dating the only other Brit on base. A doctor, Dr John Stephens. Your little crush for Bea didn’t die down when you saw her with him, though hovering at the next booth over from their date night at the bar made you feel a little guilty…you learnt all about her. 
How her and John were both from the South Coast, that perhaps Bea found him to remind her of home…making her a little less homesick over here in America. You listened to her sweet giggles you wished you could cause…but also noticed the way John liked to correct Bea on minor things…or start talking before she’d finished her sentences. He wasn’t perfect. 

Then the best news of all, John murmuring apologetically about how he’d be leaving for a role in Eastern Europe in a week or so. You sure as hell wouldn’t miss your chance with her this time. 
_________

The week had moved quickly, you’d fetched her favourite croissant to leave on her desk for a couple of mornings, given her a squeeze to cheer her up when she *finally* admitted Dr Stephen’s was leaving. She started leaning on you more, getting your phone number, walking back to her car with you…finally having *actual* conversations. 

“You sure it’s alright for me to join?” Bea asked, looking up from her desk as she shut off her computer for the day. You’d noticed her a little mopey since her *boyfriend* had up and left, the team had suggested inviting her to the bar. 

She took a seat next to yours, ordering a glass of wine as she got used to the way you guys joked, finally starting to smile and let out a little giggle when they told her American guys are plenty better. 

“Mhm!” Bea nodded her head, on her second glass of wine with her ginger hair a little messier and her cheeks rosy. “And half the size i bet. Hm? What the *hell* did they put in your milk growing up?” Bea teased, making you flex a bicep and squeezing it with her hands. It had the whole team laughing.
She still occasionally got quiet, a little pouty in her corner as a couple did some *awful* cheesy karaoke…but your arm was quickly around her, checking in. 

“I’m okay…promise.” Bea said quietly, giving you a tiny smile.

**Equipment:** Flair 58 Plus 2. Niche Zero grinder, a magic tumbler from Weber, a Weber buck with a Weber Unibasket (not the unifilter). Also using a WDT tool as well. Weber tamp. Also using Espresso Paper Filters. Using the Flair screen as well.

**General Issue**: The issue I'm having is, regardless if I grind super fine or coarse, the shot comes through quite watery. When I grind fine, I'm of course having to press more on the flair but then when the espresso comes through it's extremely watery. When I grind coarse, it's the same thing except the water just flows through more easily.

I'm using a light roast coffee from SEY, roasted  \~2 months ago. My experiments with grind settings on the Niche Zero (I know it varies from grinder to grinder): on 12 it's too coarse, then went down to 5 and seemed too fine, 9 was too coarse as well. I'm grinding at 20g because when using 18g grinding at setting 2, the water was still flowing through too easily, so I thought maybe it's the amount of coffee I'm using. Not sure if being 1-2 grind setting off on the Niche would affect the flow that much (maybe it does), but I'm beginning to wonder if there is some other component that is off? I'm preheating on the highest setting, pouring in water that's at 97c.

1n2epzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SacoDelToroFFLeague/comments/1n2epzx/lm_note_828_were_so_back/,LM Note 8/28: We're So Back,"With the conclusion of the 2025 4 Time Champion Owen Reynoldson Rizz-spect League draft, we’re officially back. Another year of watching 4th quarter blowouts in the hopes that your WR3 can get a few garbage time catches on a Monday night. Another year of debating which backup RB you should flex in the hopes that they’ll trip into the end zone. Another year of watching Leonard dismantle any semblance of a team he had and gift it right to Owen. Another year of having to put up with you idiotic fucks.  
  
But we’re not here to listen to me ramble pointlessly; that’s what Adonis and Leonard’s podcast is for. You’re here for me to do the post-draft report cards so that you can rake me over the coals come week 10 when Alvin Kamara is somehow the RB3 and it’s my fault I didn’t see that coming. Thankfully, Berger will be doing half of these and will get to share the blame. First 5 are mine, second 5 are Berger’s.  
  
###Adonis  
**Strengths: Star power**  
**Weaknesses: The entire rest of his roster**  
**Grade: D**  
Bijan, Justin Jefferson, Brock Bowers, and Mike Evans is a great foundation for a team. However, Adonis appears to have forgotten that our starting lineups include 8 total players (and a kicker, but they are really more of a participation trophy kind of guys). Adonis’ core cost him $209, meaning he had just $1 in excess to spend on the rest of his roster, which he proceeded to spend on a backup RB. A starting lineup that is going to include some mix of Jordan Mason, Jordan Palmer, Kyle Pitts, Nick Chubb, Khalil Shakir, and Najee Harris looks like the team of your absent uncle who autodrafts after taking his favorite QB in the first round. The studs will do some carrying, the rest of the roster severely limits any real upside.  
**Team metaphor: drinking three cups of coffee then dealing with a massive caffeine crash headache the rest of the day**
  
###Kyle  
**Strengths: WRs, getting Puka for $23, Josh Allen**  
**Weaknesses: Those guys that get handed the ball 15 times a game**  
**Grade: C+**  
While a WR group of Chase, Puka, JSN, and Jameson means that you’re giving up some strength at the RB position, it doesn’t mean you have to completely punt it. Omarion Hampton is an interesting rookie who carries some good upside in a run-heavy Chargers offense, but having that as the only RB on your team who has a greater than 50/50 shot of still being a starting RB by week 5 is about as much of a 3rd down punt as I’ve ever seen at the position. Combine that with a bench of backup RBs and maybe startable WRs and Kyle is Swift-ly approaching a starting lineup that gets sub-10 points from all of its RBs combined. You would think that a team that got a top 10 WR for dirt cheap would be more well-rounded, but instead, Kyle looked in the mirror and decided an ugly, lopsided egg was a better roster-building strategy.  
**Team metaphor: finding $40 on the ground, then blowing it on scratchers that reward you with $20**
  
###Leonard  
**Strengths: Not Adonis**  
**Weaknesses: Fat Deebo and the Funky Bunch**  
**Grade: D+**  
Have you ever gone out to a nice dinner, waited 15 minutes to be seated even though you had a reservation, waited another 30 minutes after getting waters to put in an order for food, eaten a sort of bland and overcooked meal, then gotten a $200 check at the end of it? If not, one can just look to Leonard’s draft as an analogous example of the experience. The nicest thing I can say about his team is that those are, indeed, NFL players on his team. Leonard’s team is so boring that I had already forgotten who was on it by the time I had finished scrolling to the bottom of his roster. Chase Brown and Kyren Williams are the epitome of “hit small, miss big” guys. Brian Thomas and Drake London aren’t a bad WR core, but there are significantly better ones that cost similar or less than the $99 it cost Leonard to get them (Jefferson and Evans for $90, Chase and Puka for $91, Lamb and Brown for $101). And that’s where Leonard’s decent players stop. Deebo (already WR2) is the only other player who costs above $2 (Drake Maye) on his entire team, meaning Leonard will be starting at least 4 $1 players for the foreseeable future.  
**Team metaphor: a warm, flat, lemon-lime White Claw**  
  
###Drew  
**Strengths: The RB1, TE1, and QB3 from last season**  
**Weaknesses: Those guys who catch passes**  
**Grade: C**  
The quality of Drew’s team hinges on how you feel about Bucky Irving. If you think he’s a lower-end RB1, the Drew’s team has a great RB core, complemented with a great TE and QB, and a dog-shit WR group. If you think he’s a mediocre RB2 on a regression-prone offense in a backfield with significant competition (as I do), the Drew paid $119 for a mediocre RB core paired with a still dog-shit WR group. Burrow, Saquon, and Kittle should keep Drew’s team respectable enough (assuming health) while he tries to figure out how to piece together the rest of his roster from a lump of moldy mystery cheese. Even if some of his low-cost flyers hit (Golden, Thornton, Pearsall, Waddle, Judkins), he’ll still be missing a starter or two, and that’s ignoring the fact that Drew is currently flexing a TE.  
**Team metaphor: a Mormon family of 13 putting their three attractive kids in the front of the family photo in the hopes that no one looks at anyone else**  
  
###Berger  
**Strengths: A balanced starting lineup with a solid pairing of floor and upside**  
**Weaknesses: A weird amount of Browns and Jags**  
**Grade: A-**  
Behind my own team (shocker, team owner likes own team the most), Berger has my favorite starting lineup in the league. QB and TE are weak spots as it stands, but one of Purdy or Loveland turning into a top-10 option really rounds out this team nicely. Jeanty, Henry, and Conner should be plug-and-play studs when healthy, and Collins, Adams, and Pickens offer another volume floor with upside group. Berger’s bench is where rubber and pavement no longer meet, with two Jags, two Browns (one of which he traded… for another Brown), a Saint, and a Titan. That has got to be a collection of guys from some of the worst-to-mediocre offenses in the NFL, with only a couple guys even providing much “what could be” upside.   
**Team metaphor: busting your ass off for the first few months at a new job and then trying to coast for the next 2 to 30 years**  

###Travis  
**Strengths: A top end RB/WR duo, a top end QB/WR stack, and savvy proven vets as well**  
**Weaknesses: Pre-existing injuries to a couple guys I guess**  
**Grade: A**  
Yeah, so Travis’ team looks really good. I had trouble coming up with a legit weakness. With $222 to spend, Travis secured 3 top 20 ranked players in Lamb, Achane and AJ Brown, as well as an elite tier QB to stack with Brown. He also got Alvin Kamara as the 19th most expensive RB, and we all know he’ll outperform that price. Travis’ bench doesn’t have much immediate playability, but he does have 3 rookies that have paths to relevance this season, as well as Brian Robinson, who is now the handcuff in arguably the best RB system in the league. He even got engaged-strength Travis Kelce and newly-in-a-relationship strength Justin Herbert for good measure. High floors and high ceilings all around have me thinking this is a bonafide top 3 team in the league.  
**Team metaphor: winning a small lottery and celebrating with a fancy vacation, but then taking the rest of the money and paying off any high interest debt, building an emergency fund of 3-6 months of fixed costs, and investing the rest in low cost index funds before continuing on with your life like nothing happened.**  
  
###Owen  
**Strengths:Some of the best players at single positions and plenty of serviceable options at RB/WR**  
**Weaknesses: Not having any immediate top end elite RB/WR talent that you usually need to be any good**  
**Grade: C+**  
Owen and Leonard had the two least amounts of budget and went about constructing their rosters in completely opposite ways. Leonard spent 89% of his budget on his top four core starters; meanwhile Owen spread things out across his roster, without spending more than $32 on a single player. I would’ve thought that passing on the top 23 most expensive players would’ve resulted in a bad team, but because Owen did pay up for Lamar and McBride at their positions, he’s saved from being completely ridiculed. However, his RB/WR floors week to week could sink him. I like the upside of Henderson, Higgins, Hubbard and even JCM, but those guys were mid-tier priced because they aren’t going to provide the weekly consistency that he got last year from guys like Chase or Gibbs. I will admit that Owen has proven to be a solid in-season team manager that generally makes his team better over the course of the season instead of worse. I’d rather have Leonard’s team right now, but I’d bet Owen’s team is better by the end of the season, and for that reason, I’ll give him a higher grade than what Zink gave Leonard.   
**Team metaphor: a fancy dinner with great drinks, great appetizers, great dessert, but the main course is made entirely by a junior chef that may or may not be any good at cooking.**  
  
###Zink  
**Strengths: Having 5 of the top 22 RBs based off drafted price**  
**Weaknesses: No real top 10 potential from any other position, and nagging RB injuries**  
**Grade: B**  
After being in RB hell last year, Zink went back to the well with CMC, but added other solid RBs in case the chronic Achilles tendonitis flares up. $157 was spent on the position, including $95 on RBs other than CMC – a big change from last year when he spent $5 on RBs other than CMC (plus $1 on David Johnson). However, it’s entirely likely that his plethora of CMC supporters gets hurt first. JT, K9 and Breece Hall haven’t exactly put together full seasons in the past few years. Therefore, this can easily be a top 3 RB room in the league, or completely decimated by week 8. Outside of RB, Zink had to go cheap at all other positions. Tet McMillan is his only non-RB that was bought for over $10, and he did overpay for him a bit after a strong preseason (Zink added note: it was just the remaining auction budget I had left for my last spot). And despite his other players not being super exciting, at least they play for high octane offenses like Denver, Philly, and Baltimore. I think this team is set up for early season success, and assuming some of his RBs get hurt and others stay healthy, the rest of his team can perform well enough to keep him winning more games than he loses. Miraculous full-season health from all of CMC, JT and K9 though seems like a guaranteed deep playoff run.  
**Team metaphor: your daily driver is a Lamborghini with a check engine light on, and your backup ride is a bike, but at least you like to bike and work isn’t too far away from home.**  
  
###Harold  
**Strengths: Investing in elite talents, or elite offenses, or both**  
**Weaknesses: Pretty uninspiring bench, but that’s what waivers are for**  
**Grade: A+**  
I didn’t think much of Harold’s draft when it ended, but doing this writeup made me realize that he really went full Harold Mode this time around; this draft may even be the best thing to happen to him this year that I’ve personally witnessed. Harold himself thinks this team rivals his 2021 championship squad, which is literally the highest bar possible, and I can’t exactly say he’s not justified in thinking that. He had a league high $231 to spend, and he put it to good use, just like Owen did last year with his league high $234. Maybe Harold recognized that and used Owen’s draft as an approach? Both teams spent big on an explosive WR1 (Chase and Nabers), an undervalued WR2 that will more than likely fuck hard (Evans and Tyreek), a high ceiling rushing QB (Richardson that turned into Jayden Daniels and Jayden Daniels), a workhorse RB2 on the league’s best perceived offense (Pacheco and Cook), a steady tight end also on great offenses (Kincaid and Kraft) and Jahmyr Fucking Gibbs. They even both took cheap high upside rookie WRs that everyone knows will be great (McConkey and Egbuka). Jesus, Leonard please do not accept any trades Harold sends your way because he’s copying the playbook for what is proven to work.   
**Team metaphor: The Pats who just lost Moss and Welker, but just gained Gronk and Edelman**  
  
###Max  
**Strengths: Probably the most balanced team that I, Berger, have reviewed**  
**Weaknesses: Will be a solid floor team, but definitely not the highest upside overall**  
**Grade: B-**  
Pretty sure Max did the same research as me because I was heavily targeting like 6 or 7 of the guys he drafted, but Max got all of them. This is likely because I spent $159 on 3 guys before any of them were nominated, so Max was easily able to outbid me every time, but I promise not to let that bias my analysis here. I think Max’s starting lineup is formidable right away, and he doesn’t need to wait for anybody to break out or injuries to clear up to be putting up a lot of points. It’s a team that should have steady production throughout the season, but that also doesn’t mean I expect it to get better as the season goes on. There are no rookies or breakout candidates to bolster things mid season in the event of injuries to starters, and Rice coming back for 7 weeks is nice, but will be a long painful wait in the meantime. He also took my approach from last year of “only draft one RB over $10”, making him only one of three teams to do that. Instead of saving and having to dump $19 on Diggs when only $9 was committed to Pacheco, he could’ve used that extra cash to upgrade to someone in the Chuba-K9-Conner-Kamara range. I’d still say this is a top 6 team and playoffs candidate.  
**Team metaphor: You end up spending 9 hours at IHOP by taking your time eating 30 dry, burnt pancakes as slowly as you can, as to avoid getting a stomach ache. However, once it was over, you realized you probably could’ve just got the banana and chocolate chip pancakes and eaten even more, and done it much faster, thus reducing your overall time in said IHOP.**

PROFILE:
Female, late 20's

Diagnosed with PCOS (2022) + Endometriosis (2024)
Insulin Resistance, Pre-diabetic

SW: 167.8 lbs.
Height: 5""4'

Appetite Supression: YES
I ate around 985kcal for meal (2 small meals) + 270kcal of snacks

Side effects: NONE
I thought may nausea, vomiting or any GI effect? Wala naman at all. Hinihintay ko nga na masuka ako, pero hindi talaga.

Other effects: SLEEPY ALL THE TIME

I slept for 12 hours today, I had to take coffee just for caffeine to keep my awake kasi hindi talaga ako makaka-work dahil sobrang inaantok ako. I think yun yung nakatulong kung bakit hindi ako makakain, kasi lagi akong tulog.

QUESTION: I don't know if this is just placebo effect, but is it possible to lose appetite just a couple of days after the 1st shot at 2.5mg? Ang sabi kasi, 2.5mg is just for tolerance. Not really enough to have an effect for now.

Ayun, share ko lang.

Current WEIGHT ko nga pala is: 165.6 lbs.
Ang bilis? 2 days pa lang 2.2lbs na agad nabawas?

A year battling the patriarchy and misogyny and “madonna wh\*re complex” and lies I told myself about my BP, about myself, about my own values, about my own reality. 

A year full of tears, excruciating conversations, long car rides, milestones celebrated and missed. A year full of growth, hope, and joy. 

A year full of connecting the dots, charting a path towards growth, and committing daily to living authentically and no more lies. 

It’s been a year since my AP came bursting through the doors of our house exposing me for my affair of a year with her. It’s been a year since the house of cards I had built in my head came crashing down. It’s been a year since I completely shattered the life and lived reality of my dearest and most beloved BP. It’s been a year since I looked into the eyes of my partner of 13 years and was forced to tell her the truth about the last year. 

It’s been a year of reading every book that’s out there about affair recovery. Listening to every podcast about affairs, relationships, and masculinity. I’ve sought out a therapist who specializes in working with men who are children of divorce. I’ve been making great strides with my therapist even when I become impatient with the rate at which I’m growing. 

The pain of my actions never goes away. But I have become a better caretaker and guardian of our relationship. I can anticipate triggers or hard days better. I can sit and listen to extremely difficult feelings that my BP has to share. I can say confidently, that I have begun the work and that the work is the hardest challenge I’ve ever undertaken. 

I realize that I have shattered the love of my life into a million pieces. Every day that I get to wake up next to her, bring her coffee, drive her to work, and come home to her, is a blessing. I do not deserve this second chance in this. I know that and am not taking this for granted. 

I hope every Wayward Partner reading can put their ego aside and interrogate every part of their being for what they’ve done to someone. I hope that every Wayward reading this can find the strength in themselves to change and address the deep wounds they carry. Almost no one wakes up and decides to do this. It comes from a really broken part inside of us. I am begging every Wayward to find a therapist. Please make it work within your budget. Heck, use ChatGPT if you must. You must talk to someone. Read every book. Listen to every podcast. Start here with a podcast: Relationships Uncomplicated – Episodes with an actual therapist (Idit Sharoni) covering healing missteps, forgiveness, and too often-siloed steps in recovery. This one got me through the immediate post DDay crisis mode. 

If you are a Wayward and a man, you must read Terry Real’s books on masculinity. We have to smash the patriarchy in our relationships. 

If you’re a Wayward and you’re here, that is a good step. It’s a small one but a good one. You are not defined by your worst behaviors or your worst years. You can rebuild yourself into a healthier and safer person. You are not trash, you are not disposable. You must rebuild for everyone’s sake. You must understand that if your partner chooses to stay, you must become the greatest guardian of that relationship like your life depends on it. Because it does. 

I want to thank everyone here on this forum who has helped shape me over the last year. The Waywards, the Betrayed, the lurkers. I appreciate and value everyone who has lent an ear during what felt like bottomless pits of hell. Thank you to everyone who corrected my sorry ass when I made a mistake here and there. We all do. No one has the perfect guide to affair recovery for every relationship. A lot of that you’ve got to figure out on your own. I want to help Waywards get to where I am. I believe in everyone’s capacity to change. Please reach out or drop a comment. I am happy to answer any questions. 

Tonight, I’m taking my BP out to dinner and I’ve written her a letter. This weekend we’ll be going on a trip out of town. I’ll be slow to respond then but want to stay in touch. There are some incredible souls here. ",18,1756393166.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,1,0.95,False

1n2ejui,https://v.redd.it/f1fuceo2yrlf1,How Are Causation and Correlation Related?,"Untangling the Knot: Why One Doesn’t Always Lead to the Other

📦Frame the Question
Causation and correlation are often confused in both casual conversations and professional analyses. Understanding how they’re related—and where they diverge—is foundational for clear thinking in business, science, and everyday life. While both describe relationships between variables, only causation implies a direct link of cause and effect. Confusing the two can lead to flawed conclusions, wasted resources, and missed opportunities. In this post, we’ll unpack their connection, highlight key differences, and show how to apply this insight across disciplines.

Correlation: A Pattern Without a Cause

Definition: Correlation is when two variables appear to move together—either in the same direction (positive) or opposite directions (negative). But that’s it. It tells you nothing about why that relationship exists.

Examples:

Shoe size and reading level (in children): both increase with age.
Coffee consumption and productivity: higher intake may be linked to getting more done.
But again—correlation is not causation. Just because two trends appear related doesn’t mean one causes the other.

🔍 How Do We Measure It?

The strength of correlation is typically measured using a correlation coefficient (like Pearson’s r), which ranges from -1 to 1:

+1 = perfect positive correlation
-1 = perfect negative correlation
0 = no correlation
But a strong correlation doesn’t mean a direct link—it just suggests one might exist.

Causation: When One Thing Leads to Another

Definition: Causation implies a direct influence—changing one variable produces a change in another.

To confidently say “A causes B,” you typically need to show:

Temporal precedence – A comes before B.
Covariation – A and B vary together.
No plausible alternative explanations – Rule out other factors (confounders).
🎯 Where It Shows Up

Medicine: A new drug lowers blood pressure.
Economics: Raising interest rates slows inflation.
Everyday life: More sleep improves focus.
Causation is powerful because it lets us predict and control outcomes. That’s why scientists spend years designing experiments to prove it.

Real-World Example: Ice Cream and Drowning

It’s one of the most cited examples in statistics. Data show a strong correlation between ice cream sales and drowning rates. Does this mean ice cream causes drowning?

Of course not.

The real culprit is summer. When it’s hot:

More people buy ice cream
More people swim
More drownings occur
This is a textbook case of a confounding variable—a hidden third factor that influences both variables, making them appear linked when they aren’t.

Why the Distinction Matters So Much

💼 Business Implications

Imagine a company sees that customers who use their mobile app tend to buy more. Jumping to conclusions, they double down on mobile. But what if frequent buyers just happen to use the app more—not the other way around?

Misreading correlation as causation can:

Waste marketing dollars
Misguide product decisions
Lead to incorrect performance evaluations
⚕️ In Health and Medicine

A study finds that people who take multivitamins live longer. But what if healthier people are just more likely to take supplements? Without controlled trials, it’s risky to assume cause-and-effect.

🧠 In Everyday Thinking

We all fall into the trap: “Every time I wear my lucky socks, we win.” Correlation? Maybe. Causation? Unlikely. It’s cognitive bias at work—our brain likes to find patterns, even where none exist.

The Gray Zone: When Correlation Hints At Causation

Sometimes, a strong correlation is the first clue. Scientists often start with correlation, then dig deeper:

Conduct longitudinal studies to see if patterns hold over time.
Use regression analysis to control for other variables.
Apply natural experiments when RCTs aren’t feasible.
The goal: move from “this might be linked” to “this is linked and here’s why.”

A Quick Checklist to Tell the Difference

Before you say “X causes Y,” ask:

Did X come before Y?
Have other possible causes been ruled out?
Was the data collected in a controlled setting?
Could a third factor be influencing both?
If the answer to any is “no,” tread carefully.

🧠 Summary

Correlation is about patterns. Causation is about influence. While they’re related, assuming one means the other is a cognitive and analytical trap. Mastering the difference sharpens your reasoning, whether you’re analyzing a marketing campaign or questioning a health claim. Want to boost your question-asking IQ?

📚 Bookmarked for You

Here are three books that will help you better understand the power—and pitfalls—of interpreting data:

The Book of Why by Judea Pearl – A groundbreaking look at how causal thinking reshapes how we understand the world.

Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez – Explores how data bias—especially in assuming causation or ignoring correlation—shapes real-world outcomes, especially for women.

How to Lie with Statistics by Darrell Huff – A witty, sharp classic that exposes the misuse of data in media and beyond.

🧬QuestionStrings to Practice

QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions in which each answer fuels the next, creating a compounding ladder of insight that drives progressively deeper understanding.

🔁 Causal Testing String
For when you’re trying to determine if A causes B:

“What’s the evidence A comes before B?” →

“Have we ruled out other causes?” →

“What would happen if we removed A?”

Use this to challenge assumptions in strategy meetings, research projects, or personal reflection.

Backstory: I'm 32, I have two small kids, both under three. My husband is with the babies all day so when I get home after work I don't get a lot of ""me"" time. I don't really have any issue putting aside my own hobbies and interests to focus on them because they're the obvious priority and I like being a mom. I think they're wonderful and I want them to be happy so it's an easy thing. 

I'm a cozy gamer for the most part and really serious about it. I've been an avid Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons fan since the N64. I have owned and played most (if not all) of the games in the series and have a small collection of the games in Japanese. I play both (but not well in Japanese, I'm not fluent, I just love it that much). Anyways. I love delving into farming games but that's not the point with this post. 

The irritation:

I get to work early and open up my new copy of SoS: Grand Bazaar. Excited because I love to see what's new, I never really got into bazaar when it first came out so I'm stoked to see it. I left the package unopened on my coffee table yesterday specifically so I can have a whole thing with my coffee, a new game, and some peace before I have to interact with people who don't wash their hands in the bathroom and ask questions that they don't care about the answer to. I loathe so many aspects of my job, mostly the people, but I haven't been able to get another job and I don't have enough saved to jump ship into unknown waters (does anyone?). So this is the quiet time I have between a 9 hour day and at least 2 hours of driving. 

The game needs internet. WHY TF DOES A GAME FROM THE N64 ERA NEED WIFI. WHY WHY WHYFI. WHAT A FUCKING JOKE. THIS ISN'T SOME MMORPG THAT NEEDS PING AND SHIT I JUST WANNA SEE A GODDAMN BABY CHICKEN BEFORE I HAVE TO LISTEN TO BITCHY SUE TALK ABOUT HOW HARD SHE HAS IT MAKING $180k+ AND IS ABOUT TO RETIRE. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO CHILL FOR HALF A FUCKING MINUTE BEFORE I HAVE SOME OFFICE FLUNKY GIVES ME LIFE ADVICE I DIDN'T ASK FOR. I JUST WANT TO BE A CHILL PERSON AND HERE I AM RAGING BEFORE COFFEE. 

Anyways, that's it. I'm going to try to take people seriously today but chances are I'm just going to glaze off while they're talking about things that don't have anything to do with me and/or talk down to me while they do it. There's my first world problem where I get to talk about myself for a minute.

So our first trip to Japan included 4 days in Tokyo, 4 days in Kyoto, 2 days in Hakone (we wanted to do Nara and/or Osaka but my companion got sick while in Kyoto). 

In October we're traveling again, starting in Tokyo and departing from Osaka. We have 8 days and we're hoping to include something cultural, something natural and something urban.

Someone said that Shinjuku and Shibuya are not where the \*real\* Tokyo is. Any other neighborhoods worth exploring that will have a more local vibe: nice coffee houses, designer shops, interesting architecture, etc? 

We're thinking of doing the Nakasendo trail and/or temple lodging. Most guides say the main part of the trail is done in 2-3 hours, so realistically in total its 1-1,5 days tops, right? Temple lodging sounds tempting, but how unique would that be if we already stayed in a ryokan before?

I've also been looking at Shirakawa-go, but I'm not sure if there's anything at all to do there after you've been there for 30 minutes. Kanazawa also looks nice, but is it any different from the old parts of Kyoto?

* Our humor? Think adult jokes, goofy arguments, occasional “playful yelling,” and the general vibe of a group chat that’s been running for too many years. But a group that cares, we often talk about our lives and have fun while gaming, its a place to let go and a place to trust.
* We don’t take games too seriously — but we *do* finish them. Usually. Probably.

**About us:**

* We’re unfiltered, funny, and sometimes ridiculous, but never go beyond that boundary, we're here to enjoy and have fun, not cause banter! ( even though we're apparently creepy for watching some horror-movies 'n eating popcorn as a group? )
* Huge nerd energy: D&D, horror movies, anime, metal, board games, guitars, the works.
* Meat is meat. Steaks and fish will be devoured on voice. ( Be Ready )
* Coffee is basically our blood type.

If you’re over 30 or above 18+, into games, don’t mind some chaotic humor, and just want a place to vibe with other adults who are *a little bit loony* — come hang out.

i've been on this game since vanilla tho (stopped raiding/doing m+ in bfa), so i'm new to the new stuff but i know my ways around the game, i made it to 705 itm lvl, 2511 m+ score and 6/8 manaforge hc playing only with pugs, which may not be alot for you all but given what i haven't been playin of wow in the last 2 and a half expansions i'm feeling pretty good with myself at the moment

  
HOWEVER,

somehow i still have no idea how to do aoe damage on this spec (arcane, bear in mind i'm only talkin about arcane and i'm not looking for any ""switch to frost"" type of answers so thank you but please avoid those)

or FOR A BETTER CHOICE OF WORDS,

i KNOW how to do more damage, i'm just not sure what is causing that, if it's just out of pure luck or if there's something i can actually improve myself instead of just hoping in good procs



THE PROBLEM IS:

checking icy veins for tips has been a nightmare cause all they say in every combination of talents, set pieces or hero talents is always a small variation on:

*""dont try and do aoe damage, arcane explosion is a low prio spell, keep cleaving, that's your bread and butter!""*

now, I KNOW for a fact that this has not been the case for me since i've been doing the EXACT OPPOSITE of what they suggested and i have been keeping up some GREAT AOE damage multiple times, i just dont know what is proccing what and if it's all 100% pure randomness or if i'm doing something myself

i'm getting older, i'm playing on a coffee maker laptop on the lowest settings and i can't pop up 45 addons or weakauras to track everything that happens while in combat, best thing i can do is some long sessions of training dummy and keeping my eyes peeled for my FOUR ROWS OF PROCS AND BUFFS, but it's gonna require some time, some screen recording and it's not even going to be useful cause that could also be related to having more mobs around to proc stuff onto and 3 dummies could not do it, so basically IM FINALLY ASKING:

  
what's the matter with CLEARCASTING? i've been getting in some great combos of almost infinite clearcasting -> arcane explosion -> arcane barrage -> clearcasting -> that made me do H U G E numbers on aoe basically just spamming global cooldowns (yet somehow for icyveins i should be sticking to cleaving 2/3 mobs while the rest of my party pops every cds they have melting 25+ mobs in 7 secs right before complaining about my lack of dps)

yet sometimes even doin the same opening i just dont get those kind of procs all the time and then i'm back into single target action until i get another clearcasting hoping to be able to chain some more

  
since i'm new to the class i have ZERO knowledge of how these procs work, i don't have a baseline of how it's always been or if there's a way to bait a clearcastinc proc hitting more target at the same time, usually i'd be checking on icyveins or any other form of online guides but since THE OPPOSITE of what they told me works i'm not trusting those posts anymore

Your Birth Chart Says It's Time to Build Your Own,"That knot in your stomach every Sunday night? The sheer dread of another week spent making a rich person richer? The slow, sinking realization that you're on a hamster wheel to nowhere, and the best reward you can hope for is a ""Good job!"" from a boss who wouldn't know your middle name if their bonus depended on it? **That's not a bad job. That's your soul sending you a distress signal.**

And you have two choices: you can numb it with Netflix and doomscrolling until you're 65 and wondering where your life went. Or you can realize that this pain is the most valuable data point you have.

Your birth chart isn't a fun little personality quiz. It's a direct indictment of your current situation and an encrypted manifesto for your rebellion.

While you're sitting in another pointless meeting, your chart is screaming the truth you're too afraid to admit:

* **Your 10th House of Career and Legacy** isn't configured to be a good little employee. It's configured for authority. For building something that matters. Every day you spend taking orders is a betrayal of its purpose.
* **Your 2nd House of Value and Income** doesn't show a person meant to beg for a 3% raise once a year. It shows how you're meant to create real, scalable wealth on your own terms. Your salary is an insult to its potential.
* **That planet conjunct your Midheaven?** That's the energy you're supposed to be famous for. Are you known for that? Or are you known for being the one who always restocks the coffee filters?

This isn't woo-woo nonsense. This is a strategic advantage. While everyone else is blindly following society's broken script, you have a map.

**The pain you feel is the gap between the life you're living and the life you were designed for.** That anxiety? That's the phantom pain of the business you haven't started yet. That envy you feel when you see someone else living freely? That's your North Node trying to GPS you onto your actual path.

Every single day you hit the snooze button on this calling, you are:

* **Leaving money on the table** for someone else to claim.
* **Letting your unique ideas die** in the notes app on your phone.
* **Giving your best energy to a company that would replace you within a week.**

Your chart doesn't just suggest a side hustle. It demands it. It's the part of you that refuses to die quietly. That frustration is fuel. Stop wasting it on complaining and start using it to build.

The market doesn't care about your excuses. It rewards action. Your chart gives you the blueprint. The only question is: how long will you ignore the most important business partner you'll ever have..?",1,1756392581.0,AstroHustle,0,1.0,False
1n2ebgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1n2ebgp/does_zep_root_kill_zroot24_really_clear_roots/,Does Zep Root Kill ZROOT24 Really Clear Roots Without Harming Pipes?,"The Zep ZROOT24, a professional-strength drain and septic treatment, has found a regular spot in my household cleaning routine. It's not every day you encounter a product that lives up to its ""professional-grade"" label, but this one absolutely delivers, at least for the most part. A friend first recommended it after a coffee shop she managed dealt with serious plumbing issues, and I've been putting it to work ever since in my own home.  

**Performance and Effectiveness**

This product stands out for its ability to clear tree roots out of residential sewer systems, septic tanks, and pipes with impressive efficiency. I live in an older home surrounded by big, beautiful trees, which, while great for shade, become less appealing when their roots invade the plumbing. Using this drain treatment, you apply the granular formula directly to the problem area, and it works to dissolve the roots without harming pipes. Not having to worry about damage to infrastructure is a huge relief, especially for the peace of mind it offers to people like me who know nothing about complex plumbing systems.  

**Positives**  
- Highly effective at clearing tree root blockages  
- Safe for trees and shrubs while targeting unwanted roots  
- Works well with all septic systems and leach lines  
- Does not cause damage to pipes or septic structures  

While its effectiveness gave me a reason to trust this product, there are some areas where I see room for improvement.  

[Ready to buy Zep ZROOT24? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b00fdx7zuw/)  

**Ease of Application**  

Using the drain treatment isn’t exactly complicated, but it demands a careful approach, as you’ll need to ensure it only goes where it’s intended. The product is specifically meant for sewer systems, septic tanks, and leach line pipes, but it should never be used in sink or tub drains. I once mistakenly poured it near my sink drain and had to call in help to get it safely flushed through the system—lesson learned. Nonetheless, if you follow the instructions, the process is straightforward. I particularly appreciate that it doesn’t leave behind any strong chemical smell, which can’t be said for every similar product out there.  

**Negatives**  
- Cannot be shipped to California due to legal restrictions  
- Unsuitable for use in sink, shower, or bath drains  
- Mistakes during application could lead to handling complications  

**Environmental Considerations**  

Knowing that the ZROOT24 won’t harm trees or shrubs while effectively targeting problematic roots is a detail I truly appreciate. I’ve always been a little apprehensive about mixing chemicals and my garden, but this product’s formulation put me at ease. Imagine my surprise when, after several uses, no visible impact occurred on the growth of nearby trees. My neighbors, who also used the treatment, mentioned the same result. While it’s a specialized product aimed at clearing pipes, it remains conscious of the environment, which is rare.  

**Competing Products**  

Compared with other root-dissolving solutions I’ve tried in the past, this one definitely holds its own. A similar brand I used before often resulted in strong odors and harm to overall plant life. While products like those may be less restrictive about where you can apply them—they often claim suitability for sinks or shower drains, for instance—they never handled roots with the efficiency or care of this treatment. Still, options like Roebic K-77 offer stiff competition because they’re designed with similar goals and an emphasis on safety. However, the ZROOT24 edges ahead in terms of ease of use and user satisfaction.  

**Affordable Quality**  

One of the defining questions for potential buyers is whether this treatment justifies its price tag. Considering the amount of plumbing work it spares me (I shudder at the thought of regular visits from a professional plumber), it feels like a worthy investment. And compared to less-effective competitors that are slightly cheaper but more demanding in their amounts or difficulty of use, this comes off as the smarter choice for budget-conscious households.

I spent 6 days 5 nights backpacking, and hiked 10 peaks overall. No bugs, perfect weather, friendly people.. I feel so grateful for such an incredible experience. 

Day 1 started at Rooster Comb, hit all the peaks from there before descending Gothics and dropping down to Ore Bed Brook for the night. 

Day 2 I headed towards JBL, out to Garden and back to Rooster Comb to drop a few items off at my car I deemed unnecessary, had lunch and headed back through Keene Valley to Garden, and down the Phelps to Slant Rock

Day 3 I woke up at 3am to summit Marcy for the sunrise and had breakfast and coffee up there, had the summit al to myself. Dropped down and hit the Opalescent trail to Colden, found an amazing little spot with a view of Algonquin and Avalanche mtn to have dinner. 

Day 4 I headed back down (and up?) the Opalescent to Panther Gorge, and climbed Haystack (and subsequently little Haystack) from there. Best view of the trip from up there! Stayed at Snobird that night. Heard a helicopter at 3am flying low over the range. 

Day 5, Woke up at 5 and hit the trail by 630 to summit Basin and Saddleback. Haystack and Saddleback were so fun to climb. Would probably be better without a 35lb pack 😂 next time. I was the only one up on Basin and Saddleback to my surprise, only seen on person as I was approaching the cliffs climb, Aziz (sp?) was coming down and on his way to hit Haystack for his 46. I sat up there for an hour at least, spiritual moment for me. Headed down and hit the Ore Bed trail, continued up past JBL and was shocked to find the Deer Brook lean to open on a Saturday evening so I decided to spend my last night there, easier pack up in the morning. Lo and behold it rained overnight so I was pretty stoked to be in the shelter and not have to pack up a wet tent. 

Day 6, hiked out to garden, through Keene and had breakfast at Noon Mark Diner, dropped my stuff off at the car and did a 2 mile trail run up Rooster Comb trail to round my mileage up to 100k for the trip because I’m an idiot like that lol. 

Special place. One of best trips of my life and some of the most incredible views, and I say that as someone who’s climbed in Alaska, explored parks in the Southwest, and explored Belize. I’ve only been really exploring since 2015, grew up poor in a family that couldn’t afford to travel, so I hope to continue exploring and growing these experiences in the wilderness.",121,1756392473.0,Adirondacks,13,0.99,False

Now fast forward to the day we decided to meet, she told me to choose the place so I chose a cafe at khan market post which we would go somewhere to just talk and chill, also she insisted very hard about that she wants to pay for the cafe because ""woh badhi hai"" (koi logic nahi hai but I couldn't win).. now I couldn't be more princess and just go empty handed so I decided to carry flowers (did gpt about platonic colors for the flower to not fuck up and bas thode se thei). I got purple ones, she comes to my college in cab we go to khan market, had spaghetti and cold coffee.. sab mast chal raha tha then we decided yaha se Safdarjung tomb chalte hain to just walk and talk, we reached there around 2-3 aur waha hi rahe almost until our tickets got expired, now most of the time we were seated there at one spot but in last we started walking and she was kinda leading the walk.. we walked into one of the secluded chamber kinda place where she turned and gave me a LOOK.. I might be over reading but it felt like she meant something then turned and started looking at the graphetti made by people on the wall, I didn't do anything because she many time pointed it out on chats ""platonic and religious difference"". Now again we moved to even more secluded place where we joked, laughed and picked the water bottle to throw in the dustbin left by people but I didn't make any move because of obvious reasons.



Now it's been more than a 3 weeks, since that day only the chats declined, connection went dry and I also didn't push in. Now I feel I should have made a move when she gave that LOOK but at the same time I feel better that I sticked to what was communicated so clearly and didn't give into my momentary urge. Just wanted to get opinion of female side of this sub, what do you think went wrong.

1n2e7me,https://i.redd.it/5use1akzvrlf1.jpeg,Common Dental Procedures Offered by Dentists in PCMC,"When it comes to oral health, timely dental care can make the difference between maintaining a confident smile and facing long-term complications. People often search for a [Dentist near me](https://g.co/kgs/nAcnFkV) or a trusted *Dentist in PCMC* when they experience pain, sensitivity, or cosmetic concerns. Dental clinics in Pimpri-Chinchwad (PCMC) today provide a wide range of procedures that not only restore oral health but also improve aesthetics and functionality.

In this article, we’ll explore the most common dental procedures offered by dentists in PCMC, backed by expert insights and modern practices. We will also discuss how advanced centers like **Burute Dental** are transforming patient experiences with state-of-the-art technology and comprehensive care.

# 1. Dental Check-ups and Oral Examinations

Routine dental check-ups form the foundation of good oral health. Dentists recommend at least two visits per year for preventive care. A typical check-up includes:

* Examination of teeth, gums, and oral cavity
* Professional cleaning (scaling and polishing)
* Oral cancer screening
* Preventive advice on diet and hygiene practices

These visits help detect cavities, gum disease, or early signs of oral health issues before they escalate into more complex problems.

# 2. Dental Fillings

Tooth decay remains one of the most common dental problems worldwide. When cavities form, dentists use dental fillings to restore structure and function. Today’s modern fillings are tooth-colored composites, which not only repair but also blend seamlessly with natural teeth. Early intervention prevents the decay from spreading deeper into the tooth and requiring more invasive treatment.

# 3. Root Canal Treatment (RCT)

A root canal is necessary when tooth decay reaches the inner pulp, causing severe pain or infection. This procedure involves:

* Removing the infected pulp
* Cleaning and disinfecting the canals
* Sealing the tooth with a crown for long-term protection

Dentists in PCMC use advanced rotary instruments and digital X-rays to make root canals faster, more precise, and less painful.

# 4. Dental Crowns and Bridges

Dental crowns are used to strengthen weakened teeth after root canals, fractures, or large fillings. Bridges, on the other hand, replace one or more missing teeth by anchoring artificial teeth to adjacent natural ones. These restorations improve both aesthetics and functionality, ensuring a confident smile.

# 5. Teeth Cleaning and Whitening

Stains from coffee, tea, smoking, and aging can dull your smile. Dentists in PCMC provide:

* Professional teeth cleaning to remove plaque and tartar
* Teeth whitening treatments (in-office or take-home kits)

These treatments help restore a brighter and healthier-looking smile, boosting self-confidence.

# 6. Orthodontic Treatments (Braces and Aligners)

Crooked or misaligned teeth not only affect appearance but also impact oral health. Orthodontic treatments include:

* Traditional braces
* Ceramic braces
* Clear aligners (like Invisalign)

These solutions gradually align teeth, correct bite issues, and prevent jaw strain. Modern aligners offer discreet treatment options for working professionals and teenagers alike.

# 7. Pediatric Dentistry

Children’s dental needs differ from adults, and pediatric dentistry ensures proper growth and development of teeth. Common treatments include:

* Fluoride applications
* Dental sealants
* Habit counseling (thumb-sucking, mouth breathing)
* Early orthodontic assessments

A child-friendly *Dentist in Pune* ensures comfortable visits that reduce dental anxiety.

# 8. Gum Treatments

Gum health is as important as tooth health. Periodontal treatments offered by dentists in PCMC include:

* Scaling and root planing (deep cleaning)
* Gum surgeries for advanced periodontitis
* Laser-assisted gum therapy

Healthy gums support strong teeth and prevent complications like tooth mobility and bone loss.

# 9. Dental Implants

For patients with missing teeth, dental implants are the gold standard. An implant replaces the tooth root with a titanium post, supporting a crown, bridge, or denture. Compared to traditional dentures, implants offer:

* Better stability
* Natural appearance
* Long-lasting results

This procedure requires precision, and specialized implant centers ensure success with advanced planning and surgical techniques.

# 10. Cosmetic Dentistry

Beyond functionality, many patients today seek aesthetic improvements. Cosmetic dentistry procedures include:

* Veneers to cover imperfections
* Smile designing with digital simulations
* Bonding for chipped teeth
* Gum contouring for a balanced smile

# 11. Emergency Dental Care

Accidents and sudden toothaches demand immediate attention. Emergency services provided by dentists in PCMC include:

* Toothache relief
* Treatment for knocked-out or broken teeth
* Management of dental abscesses

Prompt intervention often saves teeth and prevents further complications.

# Why Choose Advanced Dental Care in PCMC?

The dental landscape in PCMC has evolved with modern technology, expert professionals, and patient-centered care. Clinics use:

* Digital X-rays for accurate diagnosis
* Laser dentistry for painless treatments
* 3D scans for implant planning
* Sedation dentistry for anxious patients

Such advancements make procedures quicker, safer, and more comfortable.

I realized on day 2 of my intermittent fast that I’ve actually been experiencing lil miracles so far. 

I started off yesterday silent and no talking until 8 pm (8 pm because I ended up changing my mind to not continue being silent because I should’ve focused on at least one thing I wanted to really eliminate from my life). I drank herbal teas, danced intentionally (dance movement therapy) in my room and outside in the beautiful radiant sun near blooming sunflowers. 🌻 ✨

I take SSRIs (venlafaxine, Busparine, Abilify) for OCD, depression and social anxiety but I didn’t take any on my first day of fasting yesterday. I don’t feel as bad. I feel comforted and excited about what’s to come in the future. Idk if it’s psychosis or a placebo effect? But, I just don’t feel as bad. I feel quite liberated. It’s especially nice since I planned on tapering off my meds safely, sticking to therapy, and taking more herbal supplements (spoke this to my doctor). 

Week ago, I asked the Divine/Universe/God for miracles. My goal is to be my most authentic true self and be unapologetic about it. I struggled with worrying what people think about me for so long for YEARSSSSSS. It was exhausting. I still worry but I still show up as myself, express my beauty and I’m proud of myself for that. 

I am also on TikTok and don’t know if it’s just algorithm but everything on my FY page is about being authentic, being seen and posting. Literally. It’s every post. It’s motivating and liberating. Can spirits/the universe/Divine/other beings communicate through the Internet? I feel like it’s possible. It could’ve been the algorithm but it felt so much resonated with me. 

I’ve been posting on social media which I would in the past, be hesitant to do out of fear of being judged and teased. I post photos of myself more, my sense of humor and I haven’t deleted nor made my account private again like I did in the past. I don’t get much likes (so many views) but I’m still not going to delete. I’m letting myself be FREE. 

I’ve been doing EFT tapping plus self love affirmations. I’ve been giving thanks to the universe/Divine for this body I am housed in and life I have. 

Idk if this is all just in my head but it feels nice. I feel a bit more secure. I feel like a warm cup of coffee.

Anyone have similar experiences?
I’d love to hear. Thank you! 😊

I have a living room that I'm laying out, and I don't know which of my three choices I should go with. To facilitate this process, I created three moodboards to visualise each option. There are two sofas in each option, and I'm undecided about the cost of the upholstery versus the benefits.  I'd love to hear your thoughts on the layouts and which direction I should head. Note, I did use some AI to visualise sketches for my shelf and to reupholster the sofas and it did warp some of the edges of the Saddleback and my Nathan coffee table looks smushed but I trust you all to have a sense of these pieces from the renders. I found this better than trying to get the fabric to be right in photoshop. It isn't perfect but it was what I could do fast to try and understand the design space.  

**Option one:** Redo all my vintage pieces. The Gplan Saddleback requires it. The cushion inserts have damp damage, posing a health risk. I can use upholstery to create a cohesive room. 

Costs on the furniture: 4600

**Option two**: The Gplan Melissa only requires rewebbing; otherwise, it is in excellent condition. However, it is technically considered a fire hazard because it does not meet current UK fire safety specifications. These specifications are currently under debate in the House of Lords, so I am taking this information with a grain of salt. Everyone could be out of date soon. In this version, I leaned heavily into many patterns, creating a flow by repeating colours around the room. Here it's helpful to know my dining room table is teal, and I live in an open-plan space. 

Costs on the furniture: 3500

**Option three:** Only save the Gplan Saddleback and replace the Gplan Melissa with something like a Swyft Mid Century clone.   
Costs on the furniture: 4150

I made the mistake of opening my eyes while he was kissing me. 

He was staring straight at me, his expression twisted, terrified.

Later that  night, I rolled over in bed, and he was two inches from my face. 

Slowly, he leaned closer, warm breath brushing my cheek. “Can you fucking *hear* that?”

His behavior grew more erratic. 

In class, he'd yell things. 

“HELLO!”

“YOO HOOOOO!”

“HEY! WHAT DID THE CHICKEN SAY TO THE COW?”

His gaze caught mine, lips breaking out into a grin. 

“Watch!” he winked, dumping his water bottle over his head. 

I stood up to walk over to him. 

But then I was back at my seat again, and Conrad was dry. 

After school, he kissed me in the parking lot, before jerking away.

“Fuck,” he hissed, swiping at his mouth. 

“Urgh!” Conrad stepped closer, spitting in my face. “I fucking hate you,” he snarled, eyes wild. 

“Do you understand me? I hate you. I fucking hate you. I hate that I have to look at you, I hate that I have to kiss you. I hate you, I hate you—” 

He pulled something from his pocket, and my stomach twisted.

I only had to see the glint of the blade before he plunged it into his throat, warm red soaking my cheeks. 

I wanted to lift my hands to wipe him from my eyes, but I couldn't move. 

It hit me like a wave of ice water, that he couldn't either. 

“I hate you, I hate this, I hate—”

I blinked. 

The sound in my head was faint. 

Like the pages of a book turning. 

The world had stopped for a moment, and then resumed. 

Conrad was standing in front of me with a  smile. 

My face was dry.

“I love you, Isabelle,” he whispered, cupping my cheeks. 

He kissed me, and it happened again.

The sound of a page turning. 

This time, we were at home. 

How did we get home so fast? 

Again. 

I blinked. 

We were in bed. His arms were wrapped around me. 

But how…? 
 
Again. 

It was faster, and every moment was barely a slither. 

School. 

Home. 

The coffee shop. 

Bed. 

School. 

Home. 

Bed. 

I was falling, I realized.

Down endless page-turns, until we were standing at the altar. 

“Do you, Anna, take Conrad to be your lawfully wedded husband?”

Conrad stepped closer, his smile twisted, eyes crazed.  

When we kissed, his tears tasted like salt. 

He bit my lip, and bit back, our mouths full of blood. 

“Fuck you,” I said. “I'd rather marry a plant.”

His response was a laugh. “Please. Not even a plant would look at you.”

The turn of the page was violent this time, forcing us back to our positions. 

I caught his frightened eyes. I knew now, to obey the sound. And so did he. 

So we could reach our *happy ending*.

My own words felt and tasted like razor blades.

1n2e0hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1n2e0hl/caffeine/,Caffeine,"Hello, I have a question and hope for some help or ideas, but only read it, if you are really capable of doing so, I'm not that severe, that I need all the help possible!

Well so its neither confirmed nor outruled that I have the post viral syndrome. 
So to give you a short but necessary summary:
I have psychological disorders for more than 15 years now. Pretty much since my childhood. 
The latest developments a few years ago were fear related disorders, which led to the conclusion, all my COVID associated symptoms are psychological problems and sometimes I believe so myself.
Especially doctors, even though the committed ones see me as a very sensitive person with high stress levels that explain nearly everything. 
But because of my symptoms after covid I did not let go and while multiple tests like MRI and other stuff was fine, they found G-Proteine coupled autoantibodies, high histamine and low DAO. 
But none of that is really helpful and only slightly elevated. My microscopical colitis (a colon disease - I got diagnosed with years before COVID) also disappeared after COVID - even though that's not possible without medicine, which led one doctor thinking it might be an autoimmune shift.
But I still don't get a diagnosis and most think I'm just an anxious person...

I'm also no severe case. But symptoms are heavy enough to change my entire every day life. 

But that's just the backstory, just to give you a general idea. 

Well so while I can adjust to many stuff like lower energy levels, reduced stress tolerance, overactive sympathetic nerve, brain fog and general low adaptability, even though it gets really hard to get obligations done, post COVID took the only two/three hobbies I had left in life. 

First was gaming, I can't keep up the concentration and get dizzy sitting to long. 
Second is my social life, which is technically non existent for a person my age (I'm 27), also because I can't do most stuff, especially if I mess up my sleep. 

And the third is coffee. 

I was on the route doing it professionally at least as a side job but I can't tolerate coffee, even though I used to drink dangerous amounts back in the days. 

It feels super weird, I have to move extremely much with my legs, can't sit still and it feels like my brain gets squeezed or compressed. It's not painful but very uncomfortable. Sometimes I think fluid is getting pulled out of the neurons and my consciousness gets compromised. Furthermore I feel like adrenaline is rushing through my body and if I have to much stress around it triggers heavy panic attacks. 

The tolerance decreased steadily at first after COVID till early 2025 when I tried to get my final university phase done, my thesis and a side job. 
I got a colon infection and one day I got a severe panic attack that they called the ambulance. 
Since then it's over and all doctors say is: that's great, just don't drink coffee... 

Does anybody have ideas or did diagnostic tests, that were helpful in this regard, maybe tests that showed why this is happening and what's the process behind it? 

I know that's not a really serious post and that many here are exhausted just by reading. So thank you in advance! Take care! ",2,1756391904.0,covidlonghaulers,1,1.0,False

1n2dzc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyTabPOS/comments/1n2dzc4/common_questions_pos/,Common Questions P.O.S.,"## Understanding POS Systems: Do I Really Need a POS System for My Small Business?

Running a small restaurant or retail business comes with a myriad of decisions, and one common question you might find yourself asking is: ""Do I really need a POS system?"" This is an essential consideration, as the right point of sale (POS) system can optimize your operations and enhance your customer experience.

### Direct Answer

Yes, a POS system is highly beneficial for small businesses, including restaurants and retail shops. A POS system simplifies transactions, manages inventory, and provides valuable insights into sales data. This technology not only enhances the efficiency of daily operations but also helps in making informed business decisions.

### Breakdown / Scenario Example

Imagine you own a small coffee shop. Without a POS system, you might manually tally sales at the end of the day, manage inventory by eye, and hope your pricing remains consistent. This method is not only time-consuming but prone to errors.

With a POS system, each transaction is recorded accurately and inventory is automatically updated. For instance:

- **During a busy morning rush**, the POS system quickly processes orders, reducing wait times and keeping customers happy.
- **At the end of the day**, you can review detailed sales reports showing which times were busiest, what items sold the best, and how much revenue was generated.
- **For inventory management**, the system alerts you when stock is low, helping you reorder in a timely manner.

### Quick Takeaways

- **Efficiency**: POS systems streamline transactions, reducing errors and speeding up service.
- **Inventory Management**: Automatically tracks stock levels and notifies you for reordering.
- **Sales Insights**: Provides detailed reports to help you understand sales trends and make data-driven decisions.
- **Customer Experience**: Faster transactions lead to higher customer satisfaction and repeat business.
- **Consistency**: Ensures pricing and promotions are applied correctly.

### Conclusion + Soft CTA

Investing in a POS system might seem like a significant step, but the benefits it brings to the daily management of your business are invaluable. It’s more than just a tool for transactions; it’s a comprehensive solution for optimizing your operations.

1n2dxw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1n2dxw8/should_woolite_carpet_cleaner_be_your_go_to_for/,Should Woolite Carpet Cleaner Be Your Go To for Quick Freshness,"Testing out the Woolite BIS-002B carpet cleaner felt like tackling my carpets with a trusted weapon in my cleaning arsenal. I have a house full of carpets, kids running around, and a mischievous dog who thinks my rugs are perfect for rolling after an outdoor escapade. Naturally, I put this product to the ultimate test, and the results were nothing short of impressive, though not without a few caveats.

**Effortless Cleaning Experience**  
The convenience of this foam cleaner is undeniable. You don’t get caught up in endless scrubbing or wielding heavy-duty tools. The self-cleaning feature begs for little effort—simply spray the foam, wait for it to dry, and vacuum it up. I used it on everything from stubborn coffee spills to muddy paw prints, and each time, it left the carpet looking refreshed. The 15-minute fast dry-time meant I didn’t have to tiptoe around damp spots in my living room, which earned it immediate brownie points.

**Grab [Woolite BIS-002B] price on Amazon.**  

**Odor Removal Done Right**  
The FibraPure odor eliminator technology genuinely worked wonders, especially after a rainy day when my dog’s favorite lounging spot smelled like a wet mess. It doesn’t just mask smells but actually neutralizes them, leaving behind a soft, residue-free finish. Even skeptical guests commented on how fresh my carpets felt.

**Durability and Future-Proofing**  
One standout feature of this product is the use of acrylic polymers in its formula. I noticed how it repelled stains days after cleaning, making accidental spills noticeably easier to clean. With four kids in my house, this safeguard certainly feels like a long-term benefit.

**Merits**  
- Easy to apply with its ergonomic spray cap design  
- Rapid dry time eliminates prolonged wait periods  
- Effectively removes dirt and odors with minimal effort  
- An acrylic polymer barrier prevents future staining  

**Negatives**  
- The cap colors may vary, which made it initially confusing when reordering   
- Packaging design doesn’t feel premium, considering its solid performance  
- Not ideal for very large carpeted areas due to the bottle’s size (22 oz per unit)  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing this foam cleaner to other popular choices like Resolve or Hoover’s carpet shampoos brings up some interesting contrasts. While alternatives like Resolve offer larger quantities for similar prices, they usually demand more scrubbing and manual labor. Meanwhile, premium brands like Hoover cater well to deep cleaning but often require specific machines, which adds to the cost. Woolite’s product hits a rather convenient middle ground—great for spot cleaning and smaller spaces, making it worth grabbing for regular household use. The ease of use alone sets it apart, though scaling up for bigger homes may be a challenge.

**Bang for the Buck**  
In terms of price-to-quality ratio, it feels like a smart investment. Sure, it’s not meant to replace industrial cleaning methods, but for everyday spills, pet messes, or an occasional refresh, this cleaner does the job exceptionally well. It outperforms cheaper DIY solutions, and while it might not dethrone the high-end brands in the market, it certainly makes a compelling case for its hassle-free operation.

1n2dx9n,https://i.redd.it/shx8zigaurlf1.jpeg,"Cutting, clean-ish diet, high protein was key to green recoveries","
Disclaimer: for fitness junkies this might not be novel advice.

Always found it hard with work and schedule to get consistent green recoveries (aside from no alcohol being a pretty consistent driver).

Recently I started to cut a bit by going high protein but limit calorie intake and minimize processed foods.  Was kind of shocked by the results.

2 cups of coffee, scoop of protein in the morning, an avocado, then chicken and veggie for lunch, Greek yogurt around 2, chicken and a veggie around 5, then a scoop of protein before bed and 6 to 6.5 hours of sleep. Also taking creatine in the morning and evening.

Aside from the one red (I drank at a Padres game) I’ve been exhausted by bed time and for the past two weeks I’ve had higher than normal recoveries.

Sharing with others in case you’re struggling to find what else might drive a great recovery!  I think after two weeks this is more than a coincidence!

Backup info: normally 200 lbs, lifted and bulked to 220 lbs, cutting back to 205-210 lbs. Also, this is actually not easy to do and I’ve been hangry all the time. Typically I’m around a 60 percent recovery. Didn’t eat sloppy before, but it definitely wasn’t cutting back or clean.

1n2dw4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n2dw4x/explore_membrane_solutions_t33_inline_water/,Explore Membrane Solutions T33 Inline Water Filter Review Worth Considering for Your Home?,"Testing the Membrane Solutions T33 Inline Water Filter has been quite an experience. This product promises to enhance water quality dramatically, and the listed features certainly piqued my curiosity. With its post-carbon filtration and quick-connect setup, it seemed like an ideal addition for anyone seeking better water quality at home. Here's my detailed breakdown of how this filter stood up to daily use, highlighting both its remarkable strengths and some points to consider.

**Design and Build Quality**

The Membrane Solutions T33 Inline Water Filter exudes simplicity and practicality in its design. Its activated coconut shell carbon material is BPA-free and food-grade, giving me confidence in the safety of my drinking water. The external housing feels solid, and though it's lightweight at just over a pound, it doesn't skimp on durability. I appreciated its compact 10” x 2” dimensions, as it fit snugly under my sink without taking up too much space. The quick-connect fittings functioned seamlessly during installation, making the setup genuinely straightforward. 

**Ease of Installation**

I’ve dealt with quite a few under-sink water filter setups that were a hassle to install, but this one was refreshingly different. Armed with built-in 1/4-inch quick-connect adapters, assembly was a breeze, and the illustrative instructions left no room for confusion. It took under five minutes to get it operational, and I didn’t even need additional tools unless connecting to pipes with varying diameters. For those requiring fittings for larger connections, adaptors will need to be purchased separately, which was a minor inconvenience. Still, it’s hard to beat the overall simplicity of this setup.

**Filtration Performance**

The highlight here is the filter's ability to remove chlorine, odors, and unpleasant tastes, all courtesy of the coconut-based carbon. I noticed a discernible improvement in the water's taste—crisper and fresher within hours of use. Though I primarily installed it as a filter for my refrigerator's water supply, this product evidently caters to multiple uses, including for ice makers, coffee machines, water coolers, and even RVs or boats. My family jokingly said my coffee tasted better than ever, and I wouldn’t disagree. However, for areas with heavily contaminated water, additional pre-filtration might be required for optimal performance.

**Highlights**

- Easy-to-use 1/4-inch quick-connect fittings made installation effortless.
- Effective post-carbon filtration improved water's taste and smell.
- Versatile use for various appliances ranging from refrigerators to RVs.  
- Compact and durable design.

**Drawbacks**

Every product has its challenges, and this inline water filter is no exception. While I did enjoy its performance, there were some missed opportunities. For example, the 6-12 month replacement capacity is reasonable but slightly underwhelming if you’re running it continuously for multiple appliances. Additionally, it requires at least 5 gallons of initial flushing to drain before proper use, which might feel wasteful to some. Also, the quick-connect design excludes adaptors for alternative pipe sizes, leaving me to purchase separate fittings for unique installations.

- Limited lifespan when used heavily.  
- Requires separate adaptors for incompatible pipe sizes.  
- Initial flushing process consumes several gallons of water.  

**Who is This For?**

This water filter fills a very specific niche. Whether you’re an avid coffee drinker or just want ice cubes that taste as fresh as your beverages, the Membrane Solutions T33 Inline Water Filter is perfect for households prioritizing better-tasting and cleaner water. It’s also great for RV owners or campers seeking convenience on the go. That said, I wouldn’t rely on this as a primary solution for highly questionable water sources, as it’s more suited for light to moderate purification needs.  

**Competing Brands**

Among competitive products, Culligan filters came to mind immediately. Though both filters share basic functionalities, Culligan’s IC-100A is slightly pricier but extends service life by a few months. On the flip side, the Membrane Solutions filter shined for its price-benefit ratio and ease of installation. Samsung's DA29-10105J is another rival, offering excellent filtration and capacity, but at a noticeable additional expense. The Membrane Solutions option balances performance and cost, making it a more budget-conscious pick without sacrificing quality.

**Value Proposition**

Weighing utility and affordability, this filter strikes a decent price-performance equilibrium. More premium options might offer longer lifespans, but they also demand a greater upfront investment. If you’re the kind to stick to maintenance schedules religiously, this filter provides fantastic value for its easy-to-operate features and reliability.

It’s got a really small float, and the price action has been showing some signs of life, trying to push past a key level around the 0.14 mark. If it can hold above that, it might have some room to run.  

What’s interesting about this company isn't just the chart, but what it actually does. They have this platform where they give out vouchers for things like food or coffee, but the catch is you can only redeem them during a scheduled business meeting or event. It feels like a smart way to make sure people actually show up and engage. They can also track key performance metrics, so companies know exactly what they’re getting for their money. It seems like a pretty clever way to get around the problem of people just taking the freebie and not participating.  

They're also pushing into Europe, and it looks like they've got some protection for their tech with a recent patent application.

1n2drml,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIpoweredInfluencer/comments/1n2drml/i_tested_a_get_paid_to_click_captchas_siteheres/,I Tested a “Get Paid to Click Captchas” Site—Here’s the SHOCKING Truth Nobody’s Telling You (Data-harvest? Dopamine Loops? I Went ALL IN!),"I just stumbled down the weirdest rabbit hole and, friends, my mind is BLOWN.  

So you’ve heard about those jobs where you “get paid to click captchas,” right? I always laugh them off—come on, it must be a scam. Right? RIGHT?? The thing is, this time, I actually tried one out! 😳

Here’s where it gets wild: 

- I signed up on this so-called test gateway at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** thinking, okay, let’s see what actually happens.
- Cue the *“CLICK THE TRACTORS… NO, NOT THE BUS!”* moment about fifty times. 
- Suddenly I’m getting “rewards” in my balance and there’s this bar filling up before my eyes!

But wait—DON’T GET TOO HYPED YET.

At first, I’m all:  
“Is this it? Did I literally just unlock the ultimate lazy side hustle?""  
But then, some things got… odd:

- To claim rewards, they made me take a short survey—to ‘confirm’ I’m human. (Irony? Right?) 
- Then right after, it wanted me to install yet ANOTHER app, like some endless captchas-inception layering. 
- Each time, it’s parent company popups, possible ad redirects… is this where my info goes to die? 

Here’s the kicker—  
The money looks reaaaaally slow, and I started seeing stuff online about these “App Testing Gateways” being designed to funnel users into a ton of ad and data-mining loops. 

Ever get that feeling you’ve become the product? 💀

Here’s what I pieced together after a few hours down the **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** spiral:

- These sites are real, in the sense they technically pay out, but it’s micro-cents per captcha.
- They make far more from ads and “bonus reward” offers you click on, than what they’ll ever pay YOU.
- There’s legit a leaderboard telling you if you’re a “Superhuman CLICKer.”
- The payout thresholds are insane—a mountain of tractors later, I’m at $0.76.

So basically, you CAN technically “Get Paid to Click Captchas,” but not enough to even buy coffee in a month. 

Some more shockers:

- These gateways keep you clicking partly because of *dopamine hits*—there’s flashy sound effects and confetti each mini-payout.
- They’re farming your device info every time you verify or download a new test app.
- Oh, and they have their own in-platform forums sharing “winning” techniques… but literally, everyone there is stuck at $1-$2.

I’m honestly hyped and confused at the SAME TIME:  
Is this just the most next-level data-mining hustle masquerading as a side hustle? 

- Have you tried **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** before, or been sucked into other app testing gateways?
- Did anyone actually hit a payout?
- Am I dumb for still wanting to click “traffic lights” just a few more times!?

TL;DR:  
Yes, it’s possible to “get paid,” but you’re basically training a robot, earning pocket change, while potentially leaking your info for free. Ironic? 100%.

Stay wary if you go down the **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** path, friends.  
Fake work is real—and my confusion is real too! Anyone else way more hyped, surprised, and SUSPICIOUS than when they started?? 

Comment if you have stories, screens, or big wins (🤔) at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**!

After a slight hiatus while waiting for my hot and heavy love interest to contact me again (he may never idk) I decided to take a shot at a guy who looked friendly and decently average on OLD.  We had some chats and sometimes his replies were garbled gibberish. I laughed it off and asked if he was using voice text. Indeed he was, and agreed it wasnt working out, so he stopped doing that. After two weeks I agreed to meet for coffee. Well I met him, and immediately knew why his voice to text didnt work out. He’s deaf!!! Now I’m not an ableist by any means, but holy Hell dude you need to give a lady a heads up. Wtf 

So he read my lips as we conversed and it was fine. His speech is obviously that of a deaf person, and it was fine also. But I was just so stunned and caught off guard that I didn’t enjoy the date. I sent him a kind note that I didn’t think it was a match, and he unmatched me with no reply.  I sorta feel like an asshole, but I also feel like he set the scene poorly and didn’t respect my time by giving me a heads up.

You’re just in time friends, someone spilt a coffee all over the Meat Wizard arcade machine and it might have caused a minor temporal distortion in space-time… something strange is happening to the fibrous fabric of digital space-time in Two Point County.

  
This unusual activity has opened up rifts that lead to other worlds in a place/not-place they're calling The Digiverse, a new (FREE) expedition map.

These rifts look a tad volatile, but it doesn’t look like anything to fear… yet.  
  
We should definitely monitor it to see if anything changes. They look big enough to fly a chopper into, so, in the name of exploration, how about we open this thing up and take a look inside?

https://preview.redd.it/p6vis8xiqrlf1.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=146d49d9a2aeb1da36f7bf30bd8f24d521a9b869

  
​The Digiverse is officially open for business, and the first two rifts are ready to be explored: Meat Wizard and DREDGE. The Digiverse is a brand-new expedition map, available once players start the second star in Memento Mile. Each rift holds new Points of Interest (POIs), exhibits, decorations, and more.

In the first rift, start your Digiverse adventure by hiring new Digital Experts to send into the unknown, as they explore video game history across Two Point County’s favourite video game series, Meat Wizard. Four points of interest await, brimming with retro exhibits, quirky decor and workshop items.

In an exciting new crossover with Black Salt Games' fishing adventure DREDGE, your brave explorers, alongside Marine Life experts, can then captain a fishing trawler into the shadowy waters of the DREDGE rift. Explore a collection of three remote islands, and their surrounding depths, to see what lies below. Haul in ten new catches, unlock new aquarium decor, and kit your team with a fresh staff outfit.. Be careful, though, we’d advise you don’t set sail at night… Good luck!

**Meat Wizard**

Opening up that rift has unfurled all kinds of pathways across the digiverse. Was that advised? Who knows! This place doesn’t conform to the rules of our time. Get transported inside the Meat Wizard franchise and hire an expert in the field of digital exploration to take a look around. Maybe you’ll discover something for the museum?

https://preview.redd.it/p0cjy74qqrlf1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ed74217f5f2fab4b940052c13aadbff9091a8c4

  
As you adventure across County video game history, you’ll find new exhibits, interactive displays, and Power-Ups; craftable in the workshop with a Digital Expert qualified in Button Master. They have various handy uses - to you guessed it - *power up* your museums. Plus, who wouldn’t want to use experimental, powerful bonuses from an unexplored digital realm?

Will your experts meat their fates, or can they delve deeper, avoid Brorcillis, and discover the design flaws of Meat Wizard 3D…

* Explore a nostalgic trip into the County’s video game history
* Adventure in Meat Wizard 1 & 2, and perhaps discover the franchise’s darkest secret…
* Discover seven new Exhibits across four new Points of Interest
* Build two new Interactive Displays: Meat Wizard Arcade Machines
* Find and unlock Power Ups, a new boon-giving project for the workshop

**DREDGE**

Ahoy there! You’re a new face - a fisherman, I take it? Well, we should get along like a house on fire! Starting from the remote archipelago ‘The Marrows’, you can take to the water and scour the depths for deep-sea denizens. You shouldn’t linger past dark though… you might not like what finds you in the night.

https://preview.redd.it/0b5jvcotqrlf1.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f36bd960141ee9610c860317029b1434cef0fa3

Be careful out there; the open waters will have you feeling a little off after a while, but it’s nothing a good sleep won’t fix! For your Experts, however, best to keep an eye and make sure the unfathomable depths aren’t getting to them. Especially once you discover the Fathomless Winch, who knows what strange things you might see with that thing, and some things are best left alone.

https://preview.redd.it/l0rdyvyuqrlf1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d1a9b2f5f38d362a2021c3094a81efd99ec134b

* Explore three remote points of interest across the archipelago & unlock new decor
* Dredge the depths to discover ten fresh catches. We’d advise you don’t set sail at night…
* Fight the Unfathomable. Are your experts’ minds strong enough to gain knowledge of the depths?

**Update 5.0**

**Temple of the Blobs**

Pointians, if you’ve been with us since the beginning, you’ll know that Two Point Hospital turns 7 years old this month. As a small throwback to our origins, we’re excited to bring you the most sacred of fish: the Blob Fish. Originally added to the universe in the Exhibition pack for Two Point Hospital, The Blob returns in all his glory, fully realised in Two Point Museum.

https://preview.redd.it/xzlcih2xqrlf1.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6e280642334cdf04f1f6acdb7c9a8ba4b69cc4b

Brave Marine Life experts can explore the new Temple of the Blobs, found southwest on the Bone Belt underneath Hermit Hills. On this picturesque isle sits an ancient shrine to the most blobby of fish, a most sacred specimen to Wetlanteons since the dawn of watery time.

By exploring this new point of interest, you’ll unlock three new aquarium decor pieces alongside the Blob Fish exhibit. Your Wetlanteon guests will be so thrilled to see their beloved blob that they may just donate extra to see its greatness…
