1hg5y9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1hg5y9u/moms_night_out_for_work_dinner_with_a_client/,"Mom's night out for ""work dinner"" with a client ","Took ages to write this story, i wanted to express everything what i felt in writing. It is long story but worthy to read

I (45)F  finally convinced my boys that Mommy has to go out for a private dinner with a client tonight. 

my younger one, bless his heart, really wanted to come with me. He’s still that little guy who wants to be glued to my side at all times, which is sweet in a way. But no, darling, Mommy’s got grown up stuff to do! So, after a little sweet talking and promising him a brand new video game if he stays with his brother, I got him to agree. Haha, kids can be so easy to handle sometimes. 


I could feel my younger one’s eyes on me as I finished getting ready. There he was, standing at the door, his innocent little face scrunching up in confusion as he watched me slip into this gorgeous gown. It’s sexy, sure, with a V-shape neckline that shows off a little too much for a “client dinner,” and the backless design definitely isn’t what I’d wear to a business meeting.

And then, of course, he had to ask the million-dollar question: “Mom, if it’s a meeting, why are you wearing a gown?”

Ugh. Kids. They’re way too honest and straightforward sometimes! I didn’t even know how to answer that without completely unraveling my little fib. But I couldn't be caught in a lie, so I quickly put on my best, most convincing “mommy knows best” smile.

“Well, sweetheart, it’s a special kind of dinner,” I said, keeping my voice calm and reassuring. “You know, clients sometimes want to make things more... elegant. Mommy just wants to look her best. Plus, it's a fancy restaurant.”

As I slipped into the car and closed the door, I took a deep breath. but I sat there for a second, glancing back at the house through the rearview mirror, feeling a strange mix of excitement and guilt. 

I shook my head with a little smile and smoothed the silky grey fabric of my dress over my knees, feeling the slight chill from the backless cut against the leather seat. It felt surreal to be dressed like this, And that’s when they hit the butterflies. Not the gentle ones you feel when you're a little excited, but the wild, reckless kind that flip your stomach upside down.

I finally pulled up to his house. He was already waiting, a warm smile spreading across his face as he saw me step out of the car. 

""Well, look at you,"" he murmured, stepping forward and enveloping me in a hug that was both comforting and electrifying. His hand settled gently on my back, and I couldn’t help but laugh a little, feeling like I was somehow both an awkward teenager and a grown woman at the same time.

""I’d say you were worth the wait,"" he teased, pulling back just enough to look at me with a playful glint. He gestured me inside, and I followed, stepping into his world

As we walked into his living room, I caught sight of a wall lined with paintings, sculptures, and curiosities from different parts of the world. 

As he moved to pour us each a glass of wine, I took another look around

""That one,"" he said softly, “always reminded me of you. The way you used to get lost in your own little world.”

I couldn’t help but laugh. ""And here I thought you liked that I talked so much,"" I teased, taking the wine he handed me.

""True,"" he grinned. ""But there was always something... more, wasn’t there?""

At exactly 9, he led me to his dining room, where he’d set up a beautiful candlelit dinner,He pulled out my chair with a playful wink, and I couldn’t help but laugh.

""Well, aren’t you the gentleman?"" I teased, sitting down and glancing around at the effort he’d gone to. “This is...really lovely.”

We clinked glasses and settled into the meal, laughing over memories, old jokes, and a few new stories.  He even made me blush a few times, giving me compliments I hadn’t heard in ages, like I was the only woman in the world.


My phone buzzed, shattering the moment. It was my younger one 

""Mom, it’s already 9,"" he said in that overly serious tone of his. ""When are you coming back?”

I bit my lip, feeling a pang of guilt but keeping my voice light. “Oh, sweetie, I can’t come home tonight. There’s a, uh, big presentation I have to finish here with my client,” I said, glancing at my date, who raised an eyebrow, trying to stifle his own laughter.

“And don’t call again, okay? Love you, goodnight!” I quickly hit the end call button before he could say another word and, to be safe, flipped my phone to silent, trying not to crack up.

My date just looked at me, thoroughly amused. “So, ‘presentation,’ huh?” he chuckled, leaning in with that mischievous smile that made my stomach flip.

I shook my head, laughing. “It was the best I could come up with under pressure! Honestly, I’m just hoping they won’t get too suspicious.”

After dinner we had some wine and talk

He leaned in, his lips hovering just inches from mine. ""I want to fill your little pussy with my seed,"" he whispered, his breath hot against my skin. ""Let me breed you.""

My knees nearly buckled at his words, the intensity of his desire sending a shiver down my spine. I nodded, unable to speak, my mind consumed by the fantasy we were about to fulfill.

He kissed me then, his lips pressing firmly against mine. The kiss was hungry, desperate, as if he couldn't get enough of me. His tongue slipped into my mouth, exploring every inch, and I moaned into his mouth, my hands reaching up to grip his shoulders.

He pulled away, his eyes dark with need. ""Take off your clothes,"" he commanded, his voice rough.

I obeyed without hesitation, slip down my gown and panties  letting it fall to the floor. He watched me with rapt attention, his gaze burning into me.

""Beautiful,"" he murmured, his hands reaching out to trace the outline of my tits. ""So fucking beautiful.""

I shivered under his touch, my nipples hardening instantly, and then his hands were on my breasts, squeezing them roughly. I gasped, arching into his touch, my head falling back.

""Look at me,"" he ordered, and I obeyed, meeting his gaze once more. ""Tell me what you want.""

""I want you to fuck me,"" I panted, my voice shaking with desire. ""I want you to breed me.""

His eyes flashed with satisfaction, and he quickly stripped off his own clothes, revealing his hard, His cock stood erect, throbbing with need, and I swallowed hard, my mouth going dry.

I laid back on bed  He positioned himself infront of  me, his hands gripping my hip tightly. ""Spread your legs,"" he commanded, and I complied, opening myself up to him.

He ran one hand over my tits, and then between my legs. His fingers found my wetness, sliding easily inside me. I groaned, pushing back against his hand, needing more.

""So wet for me,"" he muttered, his voice filled with awe. ""You're ready for my seed, aren't you?""

""Yes,"" I whimpered, my body trembling with anticipation. ""Please, I need it.""

He withdrew his fingers, positioning his cock at my entrance. ""Here it comes,"" he warned, and then he thrust inside me, filling me completely.

I cried out, my body clenching around him as he buried himself deep. He held perfectly still for a moment, letting me adjust to his size, and then he began to move, pulling out slowly before thrusting back in with force.

""Fuck,"" he groaned, his hips snapping against mine. ""You feel so good, so tight.""


I moaned, my hands gripping on hi as he pounded into me. Each thrust sent waves of pleasure coursing through my body, and I could feel my orgasm building, threatening to overtake me.

""That's it,"" he encouraged, his voice strained with effort. ""Take it, take my cock.""

""Yes,"" I gasped, my body rocking with each thrust. ""Harder, please.""

He obliged, driving into me with even more force, his balls slapping against my clit with each movement. I could feel his cock twitching inside me, his release imminent.

""I'm close,"" he warned, his voice ragged. ""Tell me what you want.""

""I want you to cum inside me,"" I begged, my voice breaking. ""Fill me with your seed, let me feel it.""

""Oh God,"" he groaned, his thrusts becoming erratic. ""I'm gonna breed you, gonna fill your little pussy with my cum.""

With one final, powerful thrust, he came, his cock pulsing inside me as he spilled his seed deep within. I cried out, my own orgasm crashing over me as I felt him filling me, his warmth spreading inside me.

The next morning, I woke up tangled in sheets, my hair a wild, untamed mess, feeling a little too much like the poster child for a ""walk of shame."" I grabbed my phone off the nightstand and blinked at the time almost 10. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d slept in this late, and just the thought made me laugh. I’d spent the whole night like some carefree teenager, forgetting, of course, that my kids were home wondering where “Mom’s very important client presentation” had taken her.


I finally threw on a shirt that wasn’t even mine, tiptoeing my way to the kitchen. Made a coffe We spent the afternoon just like that, caught between laughter and stolen glances, sipping coffee, reminiscing, and planning our next “not at all work related” adventure. I laughed at myself more than once, wondering what my boys would think if they could see me now, their “responsible, presentation preparing” mom trying to act like I hadn’t just lived out the world’s most classic rom com.

At exactly 3 PM, I finally walked through the front door, looking like the very definition of “a night well spent.” My hair was a frizzy, tangled mess, my dress was just barely hanging on one shoulder, and there was definitely the faintest hint of musky cologne clinging to me. I was trying to play it cool, you know like this was just a normal day in the life of ""Mom,"" but the look on my boys’ faces? Priceless.

The little one immediately glared at me, hands on his hips like he was the parent here. “MOM! Where were you?” he demanded, his voice somehow three octaves higher than usual. “You said it was a meeting!”

“Oh, uh, it was a long one, sweetie,” I managed, attempting my best ""composed adult"" tone and praying that I didn’t still smell like his “meeting partner.”

I can smell the flavour from my mug but it doesn't reflect in the taste (it just tastes like normal coffee).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever looked in the mirror and wished for a brighter smile? The finish of your tooth enamel can play a significant role in how white your teeth appear. Understanding the different types of enamel finishes can help you choose the best option for whitening your teeth effectively. Let's explore the top types of enamel finishes that can lead you to a stunning smile.

### Natural Enamel Finish

Your teeth naturally possess a layer of enamel that serves as a protective barrier. When it is smooth and healthy, it reflects light effectively, making your teeth look whiter. If you're lucky enough to have strong, naturally shiny enamel, you're on the right path! However, over time, this enamel may become dull due to wear or stain accumulation.

### Glossy Enamel Finish

A glossy enamel finish is characterized by a high reflectivity that enhances the brightness of your teeth. This finish often results from professional dental treatments, including:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Dental Cleanings:** Regular cleanings can remove surface stains and polish the enamel, restoring its shine.
- **Whitening Treatments:** Professional whitening services can make your enamel look glossy by removing deeper stains.
- **Sealants:** Dental sealants can also provide a glossy appearance, reflecting light and offering extra protection.

This type of finish is ideal for those who want to achieve that radiant, just-polished look.

### Matte Enamel Finish

While a matte finish is less common, it can still be beneficial for some. This type of finish typically lessens the glare and may result from natural wear or specific dental conditions. Though it might not reflect light as brightly, many people find that a matte finish can help their teeth appear whiter through contrast with the gums.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Moreover, a matte finish can offer a more natural look, which might appeal to some individuals. Just remember, this finish isn’t ideal for everyone seeking a dazzling smile.

### Textured Enamel Finish

A textured enamel finish refers to the micro-level variations on your teeth's surface. This finish can influence how light interacts with your teeth. Some people may have naturally textured enamel due to genetics or dental erosion. While it can help create an interesting visual effect, a textured finish may not be the best option if your goal is to achieve maximum whiteness.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Factors Affecting Enamel Finish

Several factors can impact the enamel finish of your teeth. Understanding these can help you maintain a bright smile:

- **Diet:** Consuming dark-colored foods and beverages, such as red wine, coffee, and berries, can stain your enamel.
- **Oral Hygiene:** Poor brushing habits can contribute to plaque buildup, dulling the enamel over time.
- **Genetics:** Some people may naturally have thicker or more reflective enamel than others.
- **Dental Health:** Conditions like enamel hypoplasia can lead to thinner enamel, affecting the overall finish.

### Enhancing Your Enamel Finish

If you’re looking to enhance the finish of your enamel for a whiter smile, consider these steps:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Daily Dental Care:** Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily to remove surface stains and plaque.
- **Professional Cleanings:** Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings to maintain a smooth, glossy finish.
- **Whitening Products:** Use whitening toothpaste or mouthwash that targets surface stains effectively.
- **Avoid Stain-Causing Foods:** Limit your intake of foods and beverages that can discolor your teeth.

Choosing the best type of enamel tooth finish to whiten your teeth not only involves understanding the different finishes but also caring for your dental health. By maintaining good oral hygiene and considering professional treatments, you can enjoy a beautiful, bright smile.

Whether you opt for glossy, natural, or even a matte finish, your enamel plays a crucial role in achieving that shining grin. Remember, brightness starts with you!

Understanding the Importance of Enamel Health for a Brighter Smile
------------------------------------------------------------------

Your smile is one of your most memorable features. It lights up your face and can even boost your confidence. However, to maintain that bright and healthy smile, focusing on your enamel health is crucial. Enamel is the hard, protective outer layer of your teeth. While it is the strongest tissue in your body, it can wear down, leading to various oral health issues. Understanding enamel health is essential for achieving that dazzling smile you desire.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Enamel serves many important functions. It protects your teeth from decay, insulates them against temperature changes, and helps maintain the structure of your teeth. But here’s the catch: once enamel wears away, it doesn’t grow back. This makes it even more important to use proper dental care and preventive measures to preserve your enamel.

To keep your enamel strong and healthy, consider these effective practices:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Use Fluoride Toothpaste:** Fluoride is a mineral that helps to rebuild weakened enamel and can prevent tooth decay. Make sure to choose a toothpaste that contains fluoride and use it at least twice a day.
- **Limit Sugary Snacks and Drinks:** Sugar fuels bacteria in your mouth, leading to acid production that can erode enamel. Cut down on sweets and sugary beverages for better enamel health.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking water not only keeps you hydrated but also helps wash away food particles and bacteria. It’s especially important to drink water after consuming acidic foods or beverages.
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brushing and flossing daily will help eliminate plaque buildup and protect your enamel. Make sure to brush for at least two minutes and use a soft-bristled toothbrush to avoid damaging your teeth.
- **Visit Your Dentist Regularly:** Professional cleanings and regular check-ups ensure any potential enamel issues are addressed promptly. Your dentist can also offer personalized recommendations for your dental health.

Several factors can contribute to enamel erosion, including acidic foods, improper brushing techniques, and even certain medications. Understanding what damages your enamel can help you avoid these pitfalls. Common culprits include:

- **Citrus Fruits:** While healthy, citrus fruits like oranges and lemons are highly acidic and can erode enamel if consumed excessively.
- **Soft Drinks:** The carbonation and acid in sodas can cause significant enamel wear over time.
- **Sports Drinks:** Many athletes overlook the acidic content in sports beverages, which can also damage enamel.
- **Brushing Too Hard:** Using too much force when brushing can wear away enamel. Gentle brushing with a soft-bristled toothbrush is effective without being damaging.

Another important aspect of enamel health is how it relates to teeth whitening. If you’re seeking a brighter smile, it’s important to first ensure that your enamel is in good condition. Many whitening products can be harsh on sensitive teeth, especially if the enamel is compromised. Some solutions to consider include:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** This is a common whitening agent found in many dental products. It can effectively remove surface stains when used correctly.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** These products can help maintain brightness without damaging enamel if they contain safe ingredients.
- **Professional Whitening Treatments:** Consult your dentist about safe and effective options tailored to protect your enamel while achieving whiter teeth.

Maintaining enamel health not only gives you a brighter smile but also plays a vital role in your overall dental health. The less damaged your enamel, the less likely you are to face issues like cavities and sensitivity. good habits, avoiding harmful practices, and seeking your dentist’s advice can significantly boost your enamel health.

Be proactive in your dental care routine. By taking the time to understand and prioritize your enamel health, you are investing in a lifetime of confidence and happiness linked to your smile. Plus, the brighter your smile, the better you’ll feel about showing it off to the world!

### Conclusion

Achieving a brilliant, white smile goes beyond just cosmetic appeal; it plays a significant role in your overall confidence and self-esteem. As discussed, the types of enamel tooth finishes can greatly influence not only the aesthetics of your teeth but also their health. Opting for finishes that enhance the brightness while preserving enamel strength is essential. For example, finishes that incorporate fluoride help to reinforce enamel, providing a lasting effect.

I started a new security job this past October and the site they put me at has an extremely toxic and abusive supervisor.  

Every guard there has a problem with him, 30 guards have left that site in total for the year of 2024, and in the time Ive been there alone 2 guards left specifically saying it was because of the Suoervisor. 

He has been caught in the past smoking weed on the job in one of the mechanical rooms and nothing was done about it. 

Since I started, I immediately had a problem with him in how he disrespects me and harasses me on a regular basis.

Immediately after confronting him peacefully about this, he has been actively trying to get me fired, so Ive been doing the same. 

Since then, Ive collected video footage of him doing the following - 

Vaping at the security desk on job, when residents arent looking. 

Using cams to check girls out sexually who are on the floor but he doesnt want them to know hes looking so he uses the cams and zooms in on them. 

Coming late every morning anywhere from 15 mins to 2 and a half hours late on a regular basis.

Leaving the premises (which is not allowed) multiple times daily. 

Uses private cameras with audio that only he and higher ups not on-site have access to, spending upto 4 or 5 hours a day watching me on these cameras fishing for something, and showing this confidential and sensitive footage to other guards, and multiple residents. 

Getting into 2 heated verbal confrontations with 2 seperate female residents in the same week. One where he visibly had to be held back by another gaurd to calm down. 



WHAT HE HAS ON ME - 

Taking my car to go get coffee from 5 minyte drive away because I work 8 and 12 hour night shifts and Im back by 10 minutes. 



I sent all of this to HR with evidence as well, and there response was to book a half hour interview with a member of HR, and the VP of HR and myself to ""discuss my concerns regarding the suoervisor"" 

As soon as the meetng started, the VP spent the whole time interrogating me about me leaving the site. 

It was very clear the supervisor had already met with HR for his own meeting earlier, and now rather than let me speak on my concerns with him, they just interrogated me on the concerns he brought up with me. 

I told them I was shocked by this and they couldve easily book a seperate meeting all together to ask me about those issues but this was supposed to be about my issues concerning him.. so they said ok what are the issues and on the spot basically dismissed every issue I gave them and summed it all down to ""heresay"".    

They also pretty much strongly hinted that I was gonna get fired at the end of my probabtionary period anyway in Janurary so whats the point. 

All of this genuinely shocked me as I thought HR was supposed to be seperate from the job and just deal with matters in regards to the environment youre working in (toxic environment etc..) not to dismiss your actual concerns to interrogate you on wht youre leaving the site.

I come to find out the VP of HR is best friends with our Area Manager who LOVES the Supervisor and is the one who put him in charge and is clearly helping him throughout this process even though I cannt legally prove that.  They value him because he can run the site for them, regardless of how he treats other guards and residents. 

The craziest thing about this is is at the beginning of the interview the VP just casually said hes had many HR meeting with guards regarding the suñervisor, and then just goes on to defend him and be really passive with me.


At this point my only ""reaction"" or response to to either contact the CEO of the company and talk directly with him (which is doable) or contact the Ministry Of Labour and tell them about this toxic workplace and how HR is dismissing all of my concerns. 

This has genuinely stressed me out for a long time now and has caused me to miss the deadline on my college application for January as well.

Comparing Different Teeth Whitening Methods: Which is Best for Enamel Health?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brighter smile, many people are curious about the best methods for teeth whitening, especially when considering the impact on enamel health. Your smile is one of your most noticeable features, so keeping your teeth healthy while enhancing their appearance is essential. Here, we will compare various teeth whitening methods to help you decide which is best for maintaining your enamel health.

### Understanding Teeth Enamel

Before we dive into the whitening methods, let’s start with what enamel is. The enamel is the hard, outer layer of your teeth that protects against decay and damage. It is essential to maintain the integrity of this layer, as weakened enamel can lead to sensitivity and increased risk of cavities. Therefore, when considering a whitening method, it’s crucial to evaluate how it affects your enamel.

### Common Teeth Whitening Methods

Here are some popular teeth whitening options and how they compare in terms of enamel health:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
1. **Whitening Toothpaste:** Most whitening toothpastes contain mild abrasives and special chemicals that help remove surface stains. They can be gentle on enamel, making them a safe option for daily use. However, results may vary, and they won't dramatically change the shade of your teeth.
2. **Over-the-Counter Whitening Strips:** These strips are coated with a peroxide gel that whitens teeth. While effective, frequent use can lead to enamel erosion if not used as directed. Always follow the instructions on the packaging to mitigate risks.
3. **In-Office Professional Whitening:** This method uses a stronger peroxide solution applied by a dentist. While it offers quicker, more noticeable results, the process can temporarily increase sensitivity. It is essential to consult with your dentist to assess enamel condition before proceeding.
4. **At-Home Professional Kits:** These kits are provided by dental professionals and contain custom trays filled with peroxide gel. They are usually less potent than in-office treatments, resulting in more gradual whitening. They tend to be friendlier on your enamel but still should be used as directed.
5. **Natural Remedies:** Some people opt for natural whitening methods like baking soda or activated charcoal. While these can help remove stains, they may be abrasive and can erode enamel if used excessively. Caution is advised when choosing this route.

### Evaluating Enamel Health

Each whitening method has its benefits and drawbacks, so understanding how they impact enamel health is key. Here are a few things to consider:

- **Duration of Treatment:** Longer exposure to whitening agents can increase the risk of enamel wear. Brief treatments with controlled exposure are generally safer.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide Concentration:** The higher the concentration, the more potent the whitening effect. However, this can also mean a greater risk to your enamel.
- **Frequency of Use:** Using whitening products too often can lead to damaging your enamel. Always adhere to recommended usage guidelines.

### Consulting a Dental Professional

Before starting any teeth whitening treatment, it’s beneficial to consult with a dentist. They can assess the condition of your enamel and recommend the safest methods tailored to your needs. A professional can also monitor your progress, ensuring that your enamel remains intact throughout the whitening process.

### Tips for Maintaining Enamel Health While Whitening

While you're on your journey to a whiter smile, keep these tips in mind:

- Avoid acidic foods and drinks that can weaken your enamel.
- Maintain a strong oral hygiene routine, including brushing with fluoride toothpaste.
- Stay hydrated to promote saliva flow, which naturally protects enamel.
- Consider using remineralizing toothpaste designed to strengthen enamel.

The method you choose for teeth whitening can greatly impact the health of your enamel. By understanding the different options available and consulting a dental professional, you can achieve a brighter smile while keeping your enamel safe and healthy. Remember, a dazzling smile is more than just about appearance; it’s about maintaining overall dental wellness.

### Conclusion

Achieving a bright, white smile can significantly boost your confidence and overall appearance. Paint type whitening for teeth enamel finish stands out as an effective option, providing targeted results that enhance your pearly whites without overly compromising enamel integrity. This method allows precise application, ensuring that only the desired areas are treated. Its benefits extend beyond mere aesthetics; it promotes healthier enamel when done correctly and under professional supervision.

When considering which teeth whitening method is best for your enamel health, it’s crucial to weigh the pros and cons of each option. Paint type whitening typically offers a gentle yet efficient approach compared to more abrasive treatments. Unlike some whitening strips or harsh bleaching agents, it often minimizes the risk of sensitivity and long-term damage to your enamel.

Ultimately, the key to a successful whitening journey lies in understanding your specific needs and consulting with dental professionals. They can guide you through your options and help you choose the method that balances effectiveness with enamel protection. By taking proactive steps and choosing wisely, you can achieve a dazzling smile while safeguarding the health of your teeth for years to come. Always prioritize your enamel health in any whitening process, as it is essential to maintain the functionality and beauty of your smile.

Anyway so she hired a new guy at her company recently and it’s all she can talk about. Her job in general is all she cares about she loves it and her work reputation matters more to her than anyone else. That’s for sure. 

Basically I was swiping through hinge and came across the guy she recently hired. I thought about swiping left, but it was such a funny coincidence and something in me just really wanted to have a single ounce of control over how she sees me. Try to get her to care about me. Like the only way to get her to care about me is to show that I have influence in her work world if I want to. An itch to rebel I guess or whatever you want to call it. 

Long story short I went for coffee with him, made sure conversation happened so it came up that his boss was my mom in like the first 5 min so that we were both aware, we had a good laugh about it, and then had a nice chat the rest of the hour. At the end I told him it probably doesn’t make sense to date just to respect the position that would be putting him in, but that it was a nice chat so nice to meet him bla bla. He was totally understanding and actually suggested we could be friends. Which I was like alright I have no problem with that I need more friends. 

A week later I mention to my mom that I met her new employee and she is seething. Like off the bat rage. I mean I thought it would maybe surprise her a little bit or be curious how I met him but she came at me claws out. Fucking brutal. Talking to me like she was disgusted with me.  Demanding to know what I told him about her (like not much otherwise that would have made it weird??) Interrogated me telling me I jeopardized her AND his career and HOW could I be so careless. Wanted to see all my texts with him (all we had were a few memes/reels…?????) treated me awfully after that - super cold and cruel. Verbally abused me telling me all the ways I failed her and why I was hard to love. 

I feel so violated. I acknowledge that I went on this date a little bit for the plot because I feel so controlled but also like she doesn’t give a shit about me compared to her work. But I kept it civil at least out of consideration for him. I let him know right away, I kept it platonic. She’s telling me now that I’m evil and that I’m messed up for going on the date when I knew who he was but he didn’t know who I was. Idk though, this reaction has really made me feel like she’s kind of a psycho for how bad she’s making me feel 😭

1. “Why Scroll Past When You Can Stop and Stare?”
Have you ever scrolled through your feed and stopped on a video with eye-popping motion graphics? It’s like the social media gods planted it there just for you. A 3D product spinning in slow motion, text bouncing around like it’s had too much coffee, or visuals smoother than your morning espresso—you’re hooked. Motion graphics grab attention faster than a toddler spotting a cookie jar. Why? Because our brains are wired to love movement. It’s science... and a little bit of sorcery.

2. “Your Engagement Rate is Tired of Being Ghosted”
Let’s face it—static posts are nice, but engagement rates don’t lie. If you’re posting content and hearing crickets, it’s time to level up. Motion graphics are like the cool kid at the party that everyone wants to talk to. Likes? They’ll double. Shares? Through the roof. Comments? “Wow, how did you make this?” And boom—your content’s the star. Motion = engagement. Engagement = social media win. It’s that simple.

Have you tried explaining your product in a 200-word caption lately? By the second sentence, your audience is already planning lunch. But with motion graphics? You’ve got 30 seconds to make magic. Use smooth transitions, visuals that pop, and a little storytelling magic to show why your product is the answer to their problems. People love videos that teach, entertain, and keep them glued. Words are great, but visuals... visuals convert.

4. “Did Somebody Say Brand Consistency?”
Static content is cool, but motion graphics? They let you animate your brand’s style, colors, and vibe. It’s like giving your logo a personality—and let’s be honest, it deserves a glow-up. Whether you’re making animated ads, Instagram stories, or TikTok reels, motion graphics make you look like the pro who’s got it all figured out. You’ll be the brand that people remember.

In a world where everyone is fighting for attention, motion graphics are your secret weapon. You’re not just another post in the sea of “meh”; you’re the bright, shiny lifeboat everyone wants to hop onto. Static posts are for the past. Animated, eye-catching visuals? That’s the future.

So, are you ready to make your feed move? It’s time to give your audience what they didn’t know they needed—motion graphics that make them stop, stare, and engage.

When it comes to teeth whitening, many people find themselves weighing options between professional treatments and at-home solutions. Both methods promise brighter smiles, but they do so in different ways. Understanding these options can help you decide which route to take for your teeth whitening journey.

### Professional Teeth Whitening

Professional teeth whitening is conducted by dentists or dental professionals. This method typically offers faster and more dramatic results compared to at-home methods.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Types of Treatment:** Dentists use various techniques, including in-office bleaching, laser whitening, and customized whitening trays filled with peroxide gel.
- **Speed:** Results can be seen within one appointment, usually lasting an hour or two.
- **Strength of Whitening Agents:** The concentration of bleaching agents used is higher in professional treatments, allowing for deeper stains to be removed effectively.

- **Personalized Approach:** Your dentist can offer customized advice based on the current state of your teeth to ensure safety and effectiveness.

While professional whitening can be more expensive, ranging from $300 to $1000 per session, many people find it to be worth the investment due to the immediate results and professional follow-up care.

### At-Home Teeth Whitening Solutions

At-home teeth whitening options are convenient and can be cost-effective. They include over-the-counter products like whitening strips, gels, and trays.

- **Control:** You have the flexibility to choose when and how often to whiten your teeth, which can fit better into your schedule.

However, it's important to be cautious. Some individuals may experience tooth sensitivity or gum irritation from certain products. Always read the labels and follow the instructions to minimize potential side effects.

### Comparison of Results

When deciding between professional and at-home whitening, it's helpful to consider the expected results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Intensity of Whitening:** Professional treatments tend to yield more noticeable results, often lightening teeth several shades in just one visit.
- **Longevity:** While results from both methods can vary depending on oral hygiene habits and diet, professionally whitened teeth usually remain brighter for a more extended period.
- **Personal Needs:** Your smile’s condition, past dental work, and sensitivity levels may also influence the choice. For those with stubborn stains or specific dental issues, professionals may provide better options.

### Making the Right Choice for You

Choosing between professional and at-home teeth whitening solutions depends on several factors:

- **Budget:** If budget constraints are an issue, at-home options are likely more suitable.
- **Time Constraints:** If you need quick results for an event, professional treatment may be the best choice.
- **Current Dental Health:** Consult with your dentist to understand which option is safest and most effective for your specific conditions and dental history.

Whichever method you choose, maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups can help prolong the results of your whitening efforts. The choice between professional treatments and at-home solutions doesn’t have to be daunting; it simply requires consideration of your unique needs and lifestyle.

### Conclusion

Seeing the stunning results from teeth whitening before and after can be a game changer for many. The visible difference in one’s smile not only enhances appearance but also boosts confidence.

Now I’ve seen this woman on the regular for the last year and some change and never really thought anything about her besides the fact that oh she’s kinda cute in her way but definitely wasn’t crazy over her..now that I look back on it before we even remotely had a greeting let alone a conversation I would notice this chick before I had a crush on her or before we even spoke to each other staring at me blank like (emotionless)  (I’m not a boaster or a bragger but I am a good looking guy according to women I’m not saying  I’m everyone woman’s cup of tea because it’s about preference but all in all I look nice, very far from unattractive so I know its not because I’m hideous ) so fast forward to our first convo which was great because we have a lot of the same interest such as history, art, gothic churches, castles etc also outdoors and traveling (this is when I really started liking her).During this conversation she gave some of these supposed hints that people give when their into someone like certain eye contacts but more than that leaning in extremely close to me to the point where I had trouble trying to grab something I needed for the work I do because she was sort of in the way, so after couple weeks later after the “friendly” rejection I avoided her for 2 weeks not to be an asshole but because I didn’t want to feel like I was a bug or a bother (of course if I would’ve ran into her I would’ve spoken im not rude). So after 2 weeks we get some serious downtime at work and I notice her walk past on the other side across from me as that’s where she was working  for context I was sitting down in a little secluded spot where you can’t really see me so maybe 6 min later she comes walking past me on my side and says in her chipper voice good morning as she’s walking but doesn’t stop of course..I say hey but don’t say her name like I usually do…so the middle of next week we began talking again and have good interactions and again we’re sitting down and we’re talking or rather she was doing most of the talking and we’re next to each other but both of us facing each other(all that body language bullshit that I don’t believe)..but during all these weeks I would find her staring at me or maybe just staring in my direction (idk) from a distance and other days whilst closer to me she would just straight up stare me down to the point where I couldn’t meet her gaze as long as she could meet mine (and I can stare anyone down and do, apparently not her)and other times she’d be looking at my direction when I’m not looking only for me to turn around and she would quickly look away. I’m a cancer and I’m good at telling how people feel to the point it’s overbearing..sometimes she’s happy and lights up when I go speak to her and other times it’s meh,, can’t really tell..when I asked her out the first time the timing was horrible because as I got to it we were literally a min or two away from going back to work but I did not while asking her out ask for her number..have not attempted to ask her out since then or her number at all..just last week again she’s giving me the mug so I offer to bring her lunch Wednesday and of course she says ok because well who denies free food. Don’t really know what I’m asking but I guess I’m just looking for a little bit of insight to all this.

1hg5mt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDCirclejerk/comments/1hg5mt1/i_refuse_to_associate_with_anyone_who_isnt/,I refuse to associate with anyone who isn’t educated at a PhD level. Is the problem me?,"Hello all,  
  
Long time lurker, first time poster. I’m seeking some advice: I refuse to associate with anyone who isn’t educated at a PhD level. Is the problem me?  
  
To give you an example, I once ascertained that a childhood friend only had a master’s degree and even though he made several earnest attempts to meet up for a coffee, I blocked his number and immediately ruled out ever seeing him again because of his educational shortcomings. I initially felt guilty and petty for my stance, however, as I continued to remove non-PhD candidates from my life with surgical precision, I realised my convictions were helping me more than they were hurting me.  
  
It’s gotten to the point where I’ve made a spreadsheet with a cell dedicated to every single person I meet. Each person must fulfill criteria such as having already attained a doctoral education and they must be aligned with my own highly specific research interests and disciplinary aperture. If the person fails to meet these criteria, I cut them out of my life and put a line through their name on the spreadsheet.  
  
Let’s call this problem social distancing from non-PhD holders.  
  
My social sphere is less like a sphere and more like a splinter that’s somehow narrower than my dissertation’s readership. You know that saying – I think it was Mark Manson or Sophocles or some other white male who writes books and does YouTube – “Only associate with others that you aspire to be like and if they don’t meet your incredibly narrow criteria, draw a line through their name on an Excel spreadsheet and never associate with them again”. I might be paraphrasing a bit but that was the gist of the quote.  
  
The way I see it, my spreadsheet is unshackling me from the intellectual roundabouts of dealing with my family members, friends, and members of the public who haven’t pursued a heightened intellectual pursuit in an incredibly narrow disciplinary aperture like me. A few examples of encounters I’ve had recently with less educated types that curdle my blood:

·        A family member recently asked me: “What have you been doing?” I scoffed and said: “Doing? How could I talk about doing without also talking about ‘being’, ‘thinking’, and ‘feeling’? Implicit in your question is the assumption that doing is somehow separate from these other evolving states and processes; instead, they are all intertwined in processes of becoming, where each is part of a dynamic, performative reality that is constantly in flux.” I scoffed a second time and felt the third coming on (like a cascade of scoffs) and said: “You haven’t read much Karen Barad, have you?” before walking off to edit my spreadsheet.

·        On another occasion, a homeless man came up to me and said: “Do you have the time?” I said: “It depends on what you mean by ‘have’ and ‘time’…” and after a long line of questioning I found out that this person believed in a particular model of clockwork temporality that is at odds with the implications of quantum entanglement. The man hadn’t considered this at all nor challenged his ‘possessive’ and unfortunately colonial attitude towards time. In the end, I found out the person’s name under the false premise of help and support and wrote it in my spreadsheet to ensure I would never associate with him again. What a close call.

Anyway, all thoughts are welcome as long as they validate my stance on the matter. Some people have said I alienate others, but I refuse to believe the problem is me. Should I carry on as is or adjust my expectations? I am leaning towards the former. Your advice is welcome if (and only if) it’s aligned with what I say and believe. Do you have any similar stories of not wanting to associate with non-PhD candidates?",2,1734421246.0,PhDCirclejerk,1,0.75,False

But after repeatedly telling myself, 'I'll start tomorrow,' I finally turned running into a **morning habit** that has lasted over three months now. The result? My health is better, and I feel mentally refreshed all day.

Here are a few things I did to overcome laziness:

1. **Prepare the night before**: I put my clothes and shoes on the bed, so all I had to do was put them on.
2. **Start slow**: Running just 1-2 km at first is enough. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself.
3. **Reward yourself**: A good cup of coffee or a favorite breakfast after finishing the run.
4. **Find a reason to run**: For me, it’s the feeling of breathing fresh air and watching the sunrise.

I believe anyone can start this habit, even people like me who were lazy before. **How about you? What helps you overcome 'laziness' and keep up your running habit?** Share your experiences!",4,1734420844.0,runninglifestyle,0,0.83,False

However, three months ago he messaged me on LinkedIn? Even though he has my phone number. This made me even more confused in addition to the fact that three years have gone by. He told me he went through major life changes in the past year and wanted to keep in touch with people he’s grateful for. I honestly thought he had messaged me because he needed help looking for a job? Seems like he got laid off in the past year, which would also explain why he messaged me on LinkedIn out of all places. He then told me that we should catch up if I ever had time to get coffee or food. I told him that I hoped those life changes were majority good and that my life was good right now and that I was confused why he decided to talk to me after all this time.
He never responded back after that.
Now three months later here I am wondering if I was too harsh with what I said. I feel guilty that maybe he actually needed help finding a job, even though I know he probably doesn’t deserve my help.

Homebrewing lore and history ,"After a little too much coffee too late at night I went about writing a future NPC as a ""first lich"" / ""first undead"" after thinking of Hag Faustian deals and Davy J. from PotC and thought it'd just be cool that lichdom not rely on consuming souls, but tying one's soul to others and relying on Death to not collect until it is everyone's time to go.

How might this impact the view of liches though? In dnd to be a lich is to be guaranteed evil, a feaster of souls like a standard demon, yet far more blamable than a beast.

In a world where lichdom may for millennia mean ""skeleton shows up twice a century and forces immortality unto a random human/tiefling/dwarf child or offers a deal to a humble peaceful elf."". 

Though I imagine there'd always be ""Dark Lord"" liches. Given in my lore I'd still have lichdom only obtainable by making deals with thirsting lesser gods / greater fiends or by doing relentless research on souls and death.

We went to get iced coffees from a random shop and the barista was a gay young guy. We cracked a couple jokes and then we ended up going into the shop which turned out to be the dudes weird apartment. Well we both thought he was funny and then you asked to use the restroom where you two were laughing about jokes and he took you to a room where you disappeared with him. It was nighttime and then I pretended to hide in his seemingly small apartment somewhere where you couldn’t find me. Like a game. I started running down long hallways and finding different rooms. In the rooms that I went through to find a hiding spot, I noticed more and more furniture that seemed like it belonged to families. I ended up in a child’s room and tried hiding amongst the toys and clothing racks. Then I thought it wasn’t a good enough space to hide cause the door was near me. The door felt like it was growing and watching me. So I kept running and running and found a room with a bed and a miniature bed near it. I thought I can lay on the carpeted floor near the bed so I pushed the miniature bed out of the way and hid there flush with the regular bed. I stared at the ceiling and heard what I thought was the laughter still of you and the barista but it didn’t sound like any of your laughter anymore. The ceiling had moving shadows forming around me and the laughing grew closer but I couldn’t see anyone in the big long room.

Then I woke up out of my dream. Great now I can’t sleep. I hope this isn’t sleep paralysis. Normally in sleep paralysis nightmares, I’m aware it’s a nightmare and can usually wake myself up on command. Maybe because I haven’t experienced it in so long that I’ve forgotten how to wake myself up. Idk but FUCK. Thank gosh our son woke up crying a little cause I think that’s what woke me up.

I am but a humble and poor peasant of a first time homeowner seeking legal advice to see what my legal options are ahead of time before I have to resort to actual legal action in the real world. I apologize for the long post, bad formatting, and tons of questions. Also thank you in advance for any words of advice.

TLDR:

* Live-in tenant situation in Mississippi
* Tenant is creating a hostile living environment
* I am looking at my legal options to save the sanity of my mother and mine and also to not scare off other potential tenants

For context, this post is for a four bed room house in Mississippi. I am the property owner and live in the master bedroom while my mother lives in one room and I am renting out the other two bedrooms.

*Tenant 1 was polite and cordial before signing a one year lease but has since turned hostile towards my mother and I for no reason (we are a little over 1 month into the lease as of post). The only reason I could think of is that she has a lack of sleep and pent up anger as she works a flex night shift and my mother is retired and goes into the kitchen to make coffee in the morning and talks on the phone. My mother has asked tenant 1 multiple times if this was okay and was given the okay. However, tenant 1 came out of her room at 11:30 AM on a Saturday scolding me for using my own kitchen to make lunch while I was talking to my mother saying that she needs her sleep because she is a single mother working night shift. I can empathize with the hardship of being a single parent and working the nightshift but I do not feel she has any right to ban other people from using the public space at 11:30 AM on a Saturday. I would understand if the house was loud at 7 am or something but this is the same person that also uses the laundry machine and kitchen at 4 am despite knowing I work morning shift.*

*She refuses to talk to me and flat out ignores me in person despite me being cordial with her from the start. She does not want me knocking on her door at night, stating that she wants her quiet time and privacy, while also doesn't want me to knock during the day as she wants her sleep. I understand and respect that and resorted to texting as the only form of communication regarding house and tenant related issues.*

*I texted her earlier today (while she was awake watching TV) as a courtesy reminder (told her about it a week ago) that I will have workers coming in the morning to work on the house and asked if she needed help to move her stuff out of the garage so my upcoming tenant 2 (Lease not signed yet but will soon) can park inside. This was met with rather cold text responses of ""leave me alone I do not feel like talking. You cannot force me to talk to you so just leave me alone"". Again, this response was to my courtesy reminder and offering to help her move her stuff that was told me was to be donated to Goodwill 6 weeks ago.*

*I have talked to my mother to stay out of the public living areas as much as possible and I have also just stayed in my room after being irrationally scolded for using the kitchen at 11:30 AM on a Saturday. I now only text late in the evening so it doesn't disturb her at work or her sleep. I gave her a bed and furniture despite my post stating the room will be unfurnished. I offer her food and bought new furniture so she could have more space to put her belongings in the public living areas. I have tried all I can to be as cordial and accommodating as possible but she is just making everyone uncomfortable in the household.*

Now for why I made this post. Tenant 1 is openly hostile, leaves laundry unattended overnight so no one else can use the laundry, leaves food in the fridge/ kitchen long enough for the food to start molding, scolds people for using the public living spaces at, what I deem, reasonable hours and thus, creating a hostile and uncomfortable living environment.

I am seeking advice to see if I can legally evict her with a 30 day notice. I can show the lease, minus any identifying information, if that is needed for accurate advice.

* Tenant 1 and I have signed a 1 year lease. I was reading the lease to see if I had any legal ramifications and found this clause:
   * *^(The residence shall be used for residential purpose only and shall be occupied only by the persons named in the Lessee’s application to lease. The presence of an individual residing on the premises who is not a signatory on the rental agreement will be sufficient grounds for termination of this agreement. Lessee shall not use the residence or permit it to be used for any disorderly or unlawful purpose or in any manner so as to interfere with other residences quiet enjoyment of their residence. Lessee shall notify Lessor of any extended absence from the premises in excess of 7 days.)*
      * The lease only has tenant 1's name on it but she has split custody with a 13 year old daughter that lives here every other week. I have acknowledged through text that I know she has a daughter though I do not believe I said anywhere that the daughter would be allowed to stay here. Let's just assume I gave her permission to let her daughter stay here through text but NOT on the lease.
* Could I maybe try to evict her based on breach of homeowner's quiet enjoyment as she scolds people for using the public living area at 11:30 AM and clearly does not like us using the kitchen at 7 PM either?
   * **If not based on breach of homeowner's quiet enjoyment, what if tenant 2 files a complaint to me regarding their quiet enjoyment being destroyed by tenant 1? Could I evict tenant 1 based on tenant 2 and my own quiet enjoyment being breached?**
* This clause is also in the lease agreement:
   * *^(Lessor reserves the right at any time to prescribe such additional rules and make such changes to the rules and regulations set forth and referred to above, as Lessor shall, in its judgment determine to be necessary for the safety, care, and cleanliness of the premises, for the preservation of good order or for the comfort or benefit of Lessee generally.)*
      * **Could I add rules about public spaces being open during hours of 10 AM to 9 PM or something? I feel these are reasonable hours. This would allow both morning and night shift people to get plenty of sleep.**

   * *^(Lessor reserves the right at any time to prescribe such additional rules and make such changes to the rules and regulations set forth and referred to above, as Lessor shall, in its judgment determine to be necessary for the safety, care, and cleanliness of the premises, for the preservation of good order or for the comfort or benefit of Lessee generally.)*
      * **Could I add rules about public spaces being open during hours of 10 AM to 9 PM or something? I feel these are reasonable hours. This would allow both morning and night shift people to get plenty of sleep.**

I used to be underweight at 17 years old. Now I’m 20 and gained a few pounds, about 20. I don’t “look fat” but I’m not considered fat, just gained a couple pounds to a healthier weight.

My older brother stopped by since it’s winter break for him at his university.
Few days in his stay, he saw me when I was rummaging through the fridge for creamer and then he went, “God you got so fat.. You look like our grandma now.” My mom defends me saying “no, she looks fine. She’s not as fat as her, you’re crazy.”

I just ignored him and asked my mom, “are you guys done with this?” It was a box of donuts that was empty. Then my brother laughed at me saying, “you’re checking for donuts? Can’t get enough?” 
I just held back any comments. I was already on my way to the gym too so I didn’t even want to add more gas to the fire. I didn’t even feel like drinking my coffee anymore.

fast forward to tonight, we were all eating dinner and my mom saved an extra slice of salmon for my brother. I was asking my brother questions about his classes and degree then my mom went, “Let him eat his food first.” I just said, “Okay. Maybe I’ll crash at his place to call him a fatass all day.” Then my family got all pissy at me for stirring something up. Then my other brother said, “I lowkey miss it when you were skinnier. or at least lose a few pounds, you were less talkative back then.” The entire table was silent. I just went quiet and didn’t want to eat anymore.

I didn’t hate myself as much as I do now. Now I wish I didn’t gain all this “healthy weight”. I’m just sobbing non stop right now and want to carve my own fat off. 
I recovered from self harm and starving myself, it fucked up my head back then. I’m healthier and happier but to them I’m a cow. If to them I’m a cow, then I’m one to everyone else who sees me.",2,1734417936.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Holgrim reached the giant’s village as the moon rose high in the sky. The massive buildings towered above him, reaching toward the stars. Only the tallest towers of a kingdom’s castle could hope to match their grandeur. He did not see anyone walking around, so he moved quickly through the darkness, jumping from shadow to shadow, careful to remain unseen in case a giant was looking out of a window.

He made his way toward his destination: a three-storey house, crafted from the same gigantic trees that dotted the area. Ivy clung to sections of the west-facing wall, while small wooden perches lined the roof’s peak, protecting the shingles from bird claws. Like all the other houses, it glowed warmly, lit by candlelight in every window. The people of this giant tribe took things slow, so families were gathered around dinner tables as the moon rose.

Reaching the wrap-around porch, covered by a small roof—by giant standards, of course, but large enough to shelter an entire house by Holgrim’s reckoning—he activated his ring and flew up to peer inside the window of the first floor. There, he saw a family of giants: a mother, a father, and two children, all sitting down at a table, eating. The atmosphere inside felt warm, full of laughter, but there was an underlying tension. He noticed the family glancing toward a table near the fireplace now and then, as though expecting something—someone—to appear there.

Holgrim couldn’t blame them. They probably hadn’t received a letter from Thorminn in over a year. With their sense of time, they likely hadn’t even noticed the gap until recently. Holgrim pulled a bag covered in the giants' runic language off his sash and held it carefully in his hands. Thorminn Gladdsin, one of the few giants to have attended the Silent Library, had worked as one of the caretakers in the alchemy department while also studying to become an apprentice alchemist. Unlike the others Holgrim had brought back to their homes, this family was waiting for their eldest son and big brother to return home.

Holgrim tugged on the drawstrings of the bag. The sack of ashes had been shrunk using multiple \[Minimization\] enchantments, as had the other contents inside. He opened the bag and found several items inside with the golden flakes of the burned giant—unlike the usual white. Among them was a letter addressed in giant, probably for his family; a book, shrunken down to fit in the bag; and a small wooden statue of himself. Holgrim recognized the statue immediately, having interrupted the giant while he was carving it from a small hunk of Alder. He remembered the giant saying he had been inspired by the statues of great mages in the central hall of the Silent Library, and that someday, he would place his statue next to theirs.

Holgrim took the statue out of the bag, his fingers brushing over the smooth wood. He silently promised to fulfill that wish when he returned. Then, with a deep sigh, he closed the bag and walked up to the door. Pulling out a small Wand of Force, he fired off three quick blasts of \[Force Bullet\], knocking against the massive wooden door. The sound was followed by the scraping of chairs across the floor and the heavy thud of a giant approaching. The door was thrown open by the two young giant children, a boy and a girl, their voices booming.

""ᛖᛚᛞᛖᚱ ᛒᚱᛟᛏᚺᛖᚱ!""  
""ᛖᛚᛞᛖᚱ ᛒᚱᛟᛏᚺᛖᚱ!""

The joy on their faces quickly turned to confusion when they saw no one at the door. Holgrim cast a \[gigantification\] spell and stumbled slightly as his perspective shifted, his body growing from the size of one of the children’s fingers to about waist height. The children noticed him immediately, and one called to their parents.

""ᛗᛟᛗ, ᛞᚨᛞ, ᚨ ᛚᛁᛏᛏᛚᛖ ᛈᛖᚱᛋᛟᚾ ᛁᛋ ᚺᛖᚱᛖ!""

Holgrim waited as the parents approached, confusion and apprehension on their faces. He smiled gently, trying to ease their fears. The father, a stoic man who looked like Thorminn’s spitting image, though graying and much larger, pulled his children behind him and looked down at Holgrim.

""Little man... What... Your business?""

The man seemed uncomfortable speaking in Realmcommon, the language most sapient beings spoke, which was understandable. Giants were not known to converse often with non-giants. Holgrim had anticipated this and pulled a Translation Necklace from his belt, slipping the grey beaded string around his neck. He spoke to the father in Giant.

""<It’s very nice to meet you, sir. My name is Holgrim Tokamak, and I am acquainted with your son Thorminn. Would it be alright if I came in?>""

The father seemed surprised at Holgrim’s perfect Giant, but he stepped aside, motioning for Holgrim to enter. Holgrim followed the family into their living room, accepting a seat on a small stool across from the large sofa. A few awkward moments passed in silence, before the mother spoke first, her voice shaking.

""<You said you know Thorminn. Has something happened to him?>""

Holgrim nodded, his heart heavy, before gently placing the bag of ashes on the coffee table between them. His hands trembled slightly as he undid the enchantments, watching the bag swell back to its original size. The silence in the room felt suffocating.

""<I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news. There was a major calamity at the Silent Library. Your son… Thorminn… didn’t make it.>""

The father grabbed the bag, his large hands trembling as he opened it. When they saw the ashes, a collective sob tore through the family. The weight of the loss finally hit them all, and they broke down into tears. Holgrim remained silent, giving them the space to mourn. Several long minutes passed before the father, his voice trembling, asked the question.

""<How… How did this happen?>""

Holgrim paused, his mind drifting back to that awful night. The weight of it still hung heavy on his shoulders.

""<There was an assault. Decades ago, a devil had infiltrated the Silent Library, its purpose unknown. It slipped away from the other initiates when they were being shown around the tower, and made its way into the demonology wing. Several Masters discovered it and tried to stop it, but as they cornered it, it pulled out a book it had stolen and activated its magic.>""

Holgrim paused, taking a breath, collecting himself.

""<The book unleashed a Djinn daemon, a powerful being that grants wishes, but demands souls in return. The devil wished to be returned home and offered the souls of the Library as payment. The daemon accepted, and the devil disappeared in a puff of smoke. Then the daemon began harvesting every last magic caster in the building. No magic could harm it, no spell could stop it. Many mighty wizards lost their lives, from the initiates to the Council of Archmages and the Sage of the Library.>""

""<When it found me, I was protecting some initiates who had gotten separated. It took their souls, leaving only their lifeless bodies behind. When it turned to me, it said the required souls had been collected and the payment was made. Then it disappeared. I searched the Library afterward, finding only bodies. In the end, I was the last one left. The Library appointed me as the new Sage, and we cremated the bodies, honouring their dying wishes. I spent years searching for the daemon, but it had already been executed by an archdemon for theft.>""

""<Thorminn… I found him in the alchemy classrooms, his body trying to shield others from the soul-sucking magic. He was a kind person, always helping others, even in his final moments.>""

Holgrim gestured toward the bag.

""<Inside, you’ll find the last things he wanted you to have. The book looks like his alchemy notes. I haven’t read the letter, as I believe it’s for you alone.>""

The father nodded, his arms wrapped protectively around his children. His wife leaned on his shoulder, comforted somewhat by the thought that their son had died trying to protect others. Holgrim stood, sensing they needed time alone to grieve. He moved toward the open door, but before he could leave, the father called out to him.

""<I’m sorry for your loss as well. You must have lost so much more than we did, but you still took the time to tell us about our son. Thank you.>""

Holgrim’s lips pressed into a thin, sad smile. He nodded in acknowledgment, then turned and walked toward the door. His shoulders slumped as he closed it behind him, the soft thud echoing in the empty space. He removed the Translation Necklace and gave the family their privacy. He stepped away from the house, his heart heavy, the weight of his loss settling on him.

The night stretched out, filled with stars, and a pale moon hung like a silent guardian above the village. The air was thick with the sounds of nature: the rhythmic chirping of crickets, the eerie hoot of owls in the distance, and the squeak of bats swooping low in search of prey.

Holgrim had never felt so alone.

1hg4tc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1hg4tc1/how_to_deal_with_babyobsessed_mil/,How to deal with baby-obsessed MIL?,"First time mom here and my daughter is the first ever grandkid on both my side of the family and my husband’s. I understand the excitement of having a grand baby for the first time but my MIL is just different.

Ever since I had my daughter, all she ever wants to do when we’re around with MIL is to hold her. I get it she’s excited but holding her the whole entire time is a bit weird. 

One time we had to sleep over at in laws because of power outage at our building. I live in Canada so we need heat for baby girl. In laws are the closest to us and have more space for us to stay over so we had no choice. As soon as she arrived to their house from work, she immediately wanted to hold my baby. I let it go since it’s her first time seeing my daughter since the last time they visited. Then, I had to take her because baby needs to eat. When we’re done, she asked if I already burped her. And I said not yet because she literally just finished. She volunteered to burp her like I wasn’t capable of doing it. I said I can do it so she went on and made us dinner.

After she cooked us all dinner, she insisted that we eat dinner right away so the food won’t get cold. She beelined to me and offered to hold my baby when baby girl is literally happy and contented laying on her cot I set up on the couch. I said baby is fine on the cot and she could just watch her while my husband and I eat. They have an open concept home so I can see the living room from the dining room. I haven’t even sat down in the dining chair and I already see her picking up my baby from her cot. Im a bit annoyed but I didn’t say anything because I really dont know what to say. 

Every time she’s with us she always wants to hold the baby. When she visits us, the whole time they’re there she holds the baby. And it annoys me. When my parents come over and baby is asleep, they lay her down on her cot so she can nap peacefully. And they help around the house. Not my MIL. She just wants my baby and wants to hold her and take pictures of her. It’s really freaking annoying and disturbing.

One time I’ve had it though. Baby girl’s one month celebration and both my parents and in laws were there. Our siblings were there too. My parents arrived first so my mom was playing with my daughter but she put her in her cot when in laws arrived because my mom has common sense to socialize and not to obsess over my baby. I saw my MIL target locked at my daughter as soon as she walked in so I instantly sat beside my baby’s cot and stand guard. 😂 she couldn’t beeline towards my baby because our living room is pretty small and it was a bit crowded so she has no choice but to sit at the bar stool by the kitchen. We had dinner and had conversations throughout the night and I see her moving closer to the cot little by little by talking to the rest of the family or getting cookies and candies from the coffee table. When there was a free seat at the couch, she did not miss a beat and sat there right away. But to her luck, baby girl started fussing so I grabbed her, got up, went to our room so baby can eat. After I nursed my baby, I went back to the living room. Everybody was saying hi to my baby because she was wide awake and interested in the environment. During the noise, I heard my MIL asked again if I already burped her. I think its her pathetic excuse to hold my baby because apparently she’s good at burping babies. I didnt give her the chance so I said yes which is true. I already burped my child because I can burp my own child. Anyway, I guess she got impatient and asked “Hi baby! Can I hold you my baby?” She asked the wrong person. She could’ve asked me like a normal person. And i hate it when people talks to me through my baby like i’m also here. My baby cant talk yet so talk to me. I pretended I didn’t hear her since people around us were also talking to me.

I can’t pretend to not hear her or stand guard beside my daughter all the time. So how do I deal with her without hurting her feelings? Also, this is not my first rodeo with MIL. We clashed so many times but never really talked about it. It was always dealt by my husband and her. Multiple times she did me wrong but she only apologized to my husband and never to me. Help me because Christmas is around to corner and I really dont want her hogging my child. ",3,1734417675.0,motherinlawsfromhell,8,1.0,False

[Absolution by Peter Milligan & Mike Deodato](https://preview.redd.it/kvejnu3dnc7e1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dacd66a0352d30c3c18508d822acda279060382)

A woman named Nina livestreams her work through a cybernetic implant in her eye. Through it, she also interacts with her followers, making decisions based on what will please them and raise her score. If what she does isn’t sexy, stylish, entertaining or original enough? She loses points and her “Absolution” score goes down.

The followers cheer her on, or lambast her, based on her performance, some idolizing her, some lusting after her, some hate-watching in the hopes of seeing her fail spectacularly.

The livestream is televised and has industry experts weighing in and commenting on her performance. Those commentators’ input has a notable effect on Nina’s easily manipulated audience and therefore her absolution score, depending on how their criticisms are framed.

One of the industry experts is a pop culture commentator, one is a philosopher, one is an A-lister in the same line of work.

The line of work? Assassination.

What happens if Nina fails and her audience approval score drops below a certain level? Tiny bombs inside her body explode and kill her.

This is, in short, a cyberpunk rendition of The Hunger Games. It’s one told through a lens critical of social media, parasocial relationships and society’s addiction to entertainment at the expense of the humanity of the people entertaining them.

It’s gloriously unsubtle, but as told by a writer as skilled as Peter Milligan it’s still highly entertaining. 

Helping things immensely is Mike Deodato Jr., who has gone from being a middling artist in the 1990s and 2000s to, IMO, one of the most visceral and mesmerizing sci-fi artists in the business. He’s in his element here, depicting Nina’s world as a cocktail of gritty hyperviolence, cyberpunk widgets and angular panel structures.

The whole story happens in an approximation of real time as Nina completes a single mission, then decides to go rogue purely to excite her audience, up her score and potentially save her life.

It’s almost gleeful about how on-the-nose it is, and with its profuse use of current Internet slang (just as an example, commenters using phrase like “STG” and “unalive yourself”) it’s likely to grate on some people and also probably won’t age well. If you’re on board with it, though, it’s a blast.

There is actually a little more to it than just the blood and the social commentary. Nina is a human being and pretty full-fledged character, who goes through a number of emotions and major character moments through this whole thing - her past, how she ended up in this situation, and the emotional toll it takes on her plays a huge part in the story, particularly in the latter half.

So yeah, I had a lot of fun with this comic.

It won’t be for everyone, but if you’re not put off by any of the descriptions I’ve laid out above, it comes recommended.

[The Butcher’s Boy by Landry Q Walker & Pannel Vaughn](https://preview.redd.it/51gdk6jlnc7e1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4075701d8c6cd9b6329ebd7273099d43dc8e39af)

Here’s something that I’ve not seen very often in a horror story: In the first issue, the first five pages each introduce us to one of the five characters in this book. They also show us, explicitly, these character in their final moments at the end of the story - headless, or dying of blood loss, or crashing a truck into a tree, etc.

Now, that might seem at first like the book is heaping a ton of spoilers right out of the gate and robbing the story of its tension. If we know what happens to all these characters already, why should we get invested in the story?

See, that’s the part I found quite clever - the whole premise of this book is that *nothing*, and I mean *absolutely nothing* is what it at first seems to be. Throughout the story, characters are seeing things in one panel that then turn out to have been their mind (or *something else*) playing tricks on them. 

And that extends to the characters themselves, all of whom have a treasure-trove of secrets and unspoken issues that get quickly unpacked over the course of these three issues. They’re on a fateful trip to a small town in the middle of nowhere because one of them has a new girlfriend, who is a wannabe social media influencer and thinks her ticket to fame is finding alternative, lesser known locations for vacation spots. Why does she choose a creepy old town as her first pick? How did she convince all these people to come with her? Why is this town so creepy? Where are all the residents? How do we get to the point where all of the characters end up in a hacked-up, bloody mess at the end?

None of it is what you expect, including the contexts for each every one of those deaths. This is a really fun twist on the “City kids get trapped in a small town” horror story trope that is genuinely not as predictable as it looks on the surface.

And while I would *love* to delve further into those details and twists and such, I think this book would be a lot more rewarding the less you know about it going in.

[Carl & The Magic Coin by Akil Wilson](https://preview.redd.it/h3n4mb0pnc7e1.jpg?width=1156&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=708fc1163964e5b5d721560b49dc02e929d71cbc)

So, I found out about this one due to people discussing it in r/graphicnovels’ “What Have You Been Reading?” threads and the almost universal reaction to it was, to paraphrase, “this came out of fucking nowhere and now I’m crying”.

It’s the story of a man named Carl and his son, who are in a laundromat, and discover a weird coin. Carl at first assumes it’s a trick coin used to fool the machines into thinking you’re submitting real money. He decides to go ahead and try to use it, aaaaaand... Let’s just say the title of the comic is not a misleading one.

I’m going to stop describing the comic here, because it’s very short, can be read online for free, and I don’t want to spoil it for you. All I’m going to say is that I agree with the general reactions I described earlier, it’s a tearjerker.

[Into The Unbeing by Zac Thompson & Hayden Sherman](https://preview.redd.it/n2zdmfysnc7e1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48f1b1ee687c8310ed6e53a819320135c56e2c03)

Just to set the tone for this book, issue #4 opens with three scientists exploring inside the corpse of a colossal being of unknown origin. One of the explorers has fallen into a pit, and has realized the pit is the giant’s stomach, and now her companions are scrambling to rappel down the side of the stomach and rescue her before the still-active stomach acid dissolves her.

[This is what that looks like.](https://imgur.com/a/7OJqOav) 

There’s obviously more to this book than just “A bunch of explorers dig their way through a giant corpse” - there’s a global disaster happening, to which said corpse’s appearance is somewhat related, and these characters’ reason for being there, which has to do with complicated geopolitics and scientific outreach programs. The characters all have their own motivations for being part of the program and we get in-depth looks into all of them.

And also there’s Hayden Sherman, who is fast becoming one of my favorite current artists in comics - you may recognize him from the comics Above Snakes and Blink, which I have talked about here before. He acquits himself magnificently of the task Thompson sets out for him.

Yes, those details all matter a lot and make this book about more than just a highly unusual excavation/exploration story.

But, really, if “Explorers make their way through an enormous rotting corpse with its own ecosystem” isn’t gonna sell this book for you, I don’t know what else I have to say about it will.

[The Killer by Matz and Luc Jacamon](https://preview.redd.it/nkmgkw24oc7e1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=612325885e6eaf0b13f18da75b56f50cb6986829)

A French comic from the late 90s that was initially published as 13 50-page volumes, but has been collected in a nice, chunky 767-page coffee table book by Archaia.

It’s the story of an initially-unnamed hitman who, after several years establishing himself as one of the best and most valued individuals in his profession, has finally saved up enough cash to retire in a small village in Venezuela.

Problem is, his clients still have use of his skills, and after he gets dragged back to work to do some high profile killings in Central America, he gets swept up in the political ramifications his actions are having and suffers a crisis of conscience. He wants out, the people who pay him won’t let him go, and the people who may be able to help him finally disappear and rest on his laurels have their own agenda that he’s starting to have second thoughts about.

It’s epic, violent stuff, much more cerebral than the initial pitch of “Hitman wants to retire but his bosses won’t let him” may initially come across. It has shades of Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips’ work to it, and I would not be shocked at all to find out that Brubaker took some inspiration from it. I’d recommend it to anyone who’s fans of that duo, or stuff like Greg Rucka’s Queen & Country.

This has also been adapted recently into a film by David Fincher, starring Michael Fassbender. I haven’t seen it, but from plot summaries it appears to be a fairly loose adaptation that tangentially follows the plot of the comic. Maybe it’s worth a look.

[The Mammoth by Paul Tobin & Arjuna Susini](https://preview.redd.it/zqcr39n6oc7e1.jpg?width=437&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9e8031dc3e5abf1a67a93b724afe7b7cade7ccd)

The setting of this story is a valley in the middle of, as one character describes it, “bumfuck backwoods country”.

This valley has been plagued, for years, by unexplained seismic events. It’s nowhere near a fault line and therefore shouldn’t be experiencing earthquakes, yet on one occasion half a town was leveled by one. 

A team of scientists, one of whom was born in the valley, arrives to investigate. In the opening pages of the first issue, we see a member of this team, Olivia, trapped in an old house as it is destroyed around her. We then see Olivia die, graphically, as she is seemingly crushed by an enormous invisible force.

The remaining members of the team are ready to leave, their funding cut off after Olivia’s death. Then Jess, the member of the team who was born in the valley and is revealed to have been Olivia’s secret girlfriend, gets drunk, watches video footage of Olivia’s death, sees a mysterious ghostly figure in the video, and then walks out to find Olivia standing in her back yard.

Olivia is back from the dead, wearing the dress she was buried in, her face half wrecked from the incident. She isn’t speaking, and barely seems conscious, but she makes it clear to Jess that she wants to be followed somewhere. 

And thus Jess and the rest of the team follow her, hoping to find answers to both what happened to Olivia, and what is happening to the valley.

This is atmospheric, tense stuff with some fantastic character writing and cracking dialogue (favorite line: “Don’t start using alcohol as a crutch.” “I’m not, I’m using it as a wheelchair”). In fact it’s that character work which makes this book worth reading as much as the central mystery: Jess and Olivia are the central characters, and though Olivia dies right at the start, we spend a lot of time learning about the two of them and their relationship as Jess copes with her loss and processes what is happening.

Arjuna Susini’s artwork is a little sketchy and inconsistent, but it truly shines when things get nasty and Susini is required to show some wanton environmental destruction.

Now, a quirk of Paul Tobin’s writing is that he always, without fail, leaves things very open-ended after the finale, encouraging the reader to draw their own conclusions without giving concrete explanations. That’s not gojng to be to everyone’s tastes and I thought it worth warning people who were unfamiliar with his work. If that’s not an issue for you, then this comes recommended for fans of cerebral horror. 

[My Favorite Thing Is Monsters Parts 1 & 2 by Emil Ferris ](https://preview.redd.it/9d0qzu59oc7e1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5ec5163a78ddd24fb2e9ef79fb4c5458bfc5c41)

I don’t think there’s really a lot to be said about this that hasn’t already been said by the countless, breathless reviews praising it over the past few years, so I’ll keep my review brief.

Brief plot summary: Karen is a young girl, an outcast with an obsession with horror and monsters, a budding artist, and also a wannabe detective. Her neighbor, a troubled middle-aged woman named Anka, dies by gunshot. It’s ruled a suicide, but Karen believes Anka was murdered, and as Anka was one of the few adults outside her family who treated Karen like a human being and not a freak, Karen is determines to find out what really happened.

The resulting journey Karen goes on leads her to learn about Anka’s dark and depressing past. She also has to compete with other issues like the poor health of her mother, and an ongoing mystery regarding her disappeared father, and a secret being held by her much older brother, Diego, who is basically a third parent to Karen.

All of this is told in the form of scratchy artwork in Karen’s notebook, as she draws sketches of all the characters (interspersed with fantasy interludes, including frequent trips to the city art museum) and notes down her findings.

Long story short: The praise is earned. This is a complex book, a clear labor of love with a hell of a lot of care, time and talent put into it. It’s dense, it’s full of fascinating and fully realized characters, and it covers heavy topics (feminism, homosexuality, the deaths of children, parents and lovers, the holocaust, child prostitution and murder, among many others) with a tender and even-handed touch.

The book particularly shines during the passages where Karen listens to recordings of Anka talking about her childhood, where we find out she was a child prostitute who grew up in Nazi Germany. As you can tell from that sentence, these passages are *particularly* dark, but they're also where Ferris' voice as a storyteller is at its strongest. 

[Ordinary Victories by Manu Larcent ](https://preview.redd.it/sf4cj4ngoc7e1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85f38ab3f7707e1bdd86019b680e6b8170b8d35b)

You ever pick up a book on a whim and it ends up knocking your socks off? I’ve been picking through some Franco-Belgian comics lists recently trying to expose myself to more of them, and this has easily been the best result so far.

It’s a rambling slice-of-life book following a photographer named Marco, as he navigates various transitional phases in his life.

Marco is formerly a war photographer, but has grown disillusioned with “taking photos of corpses and soon-to-be-corpses” and decided to take an extended sabbatical while he decides what new direction to take.

Marco also suffers from crippling anxiety attacks, and has done so since his childhood. The book delves into this, into its possible origins in his complicated relationship with his parents, and also the way it affects every aspect of his life from work to romance and all the way into fatherhood in the final chapter. 

The book is essentially a series of conversations with important people in Marco’s life, punctuated by monologues from Marco musing on related issues. It covers generational guilt, interpersonal relationships, anxiety (there’s one fascinating monologue where Marco talks about his fear of driving on freeways - I’m paraphrasing here but the gist is “everyone is driving in a motorized coffin and you get more and more aware of it the more there are surrounding you”) and a host of other deep and complex topics.

It is also very unflinching about showing the flaws in its characters. Marco is not a perfect man. He is incredibly selfish, and this is shown to be damaging to his romantic relationships, including with Emily, the main love interest. He has a combative relationship with his therapist, and at one point goes on an extended rant defending his addiction to anti-anxiety medication - his belief is that it allows him to control his life even if it doesn’t solve the root problems, so why should he care if it’s an addiction?

But, despite these multitudes of imperfections, Marco *is* willing to change (even if he frequently needs an emotional kick in the head to realize it) and that makes him redeemable and a worthy character around which to center a story. 

This is a beautiful book, one with many profound moments discussing a multitude of difficult topics in very thoughtful ways.

Caveat to that: It is also twenty years old, and as such has a couple of dated moments that are quite ableist. The r-word is mentioned a couple of times, and a child is described as “probably having an extra chromosome” to describe his rough behavior. Those aren’t deal breakers for me and take up two pages out of over two hundred, but I figured them worth mentioning as there are folks who will find that off putting.

[Our Bones Dust by Ben Stenbeck](https://preview.redd.it/toolvqhioc7e1.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bab214e57af8eb56c4bb0a8c919005790a2cb42)

Earth is an apocalyptic hellscape, inhabited by roving gangs of cannibals talking in broken half-sentences reminiscent of popular depictions of Neanderthals'. A nameless child of ambiguous gender falls foul of one of these gangs, stealing some of their water supply. The gang gives chase.

Elsewhere, two aliens (implied to be highly advanced automatons or cyborgs of some sort, it’s never made clear) are on Earth, collecting data. One, named Attis, spots the child and decides to intervene. This is against all protocols and causes conflict with Attis’ partner.

And so, Attis and the child go on the run, from the gang, from the other aliens, and from a third, mysterious and highly violent form of unknown origin.

There’s not a whole lot of plot to these four issues besides the chase. We’re given the bare minimum to explain why the world is the way it is (mostly visual clues and brief points of dialogue alluding to the past), with the primary focus being on the survival of our two protagonists.

This is not a criticism - it’s a pretty thrilling chase, with the contrast between the whimsical nature of Attis and his partner and the brutal, primitive violence of the setting and its human inhabitants being probably the most compelling hook. Attis is given the most development of any of the characters by far. He’s pretty fascinating, being incredibly earnest in his love of humans and his desire to see the good in them despite the horror we see them committing around him.

It turns out later on that he *does* have a legitimate reason for those desires, and the book strikes a very odd note of hope against its bleak backdrop that nevertheless feels earned.

Stenbeck’s art is lovely too, feeling somewhat like a love child of Moebius and Winsor McKay. The angular, clean geometrics of Attis and the shapes he creates provide another notable contrast against the chaotic ugliness of the ruined human world.

[Parasocial by Alex DeCampi & Erica Henderson](https://preview.redd.it/h32x8xumoc7e1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d91b5812bcd97e32ea80af7f1004ba179c8fb891)

The plot to this is essentially an update of a format most famously covered by Stephen King’s Misery: A famous person gets kidnapped by a crazy fan, and has to find a way to escape.

The plot to this is essentially an update of a format most famously covered by Stephen King’s Misery: A famous person gets kidnapped by a crazy fan, and has to find a way to escape.

DeCampi takes this framework and applies it to more modern concepts like social media chat rooms obsessing over their idols, and washed up creators working their way slowly down the ranks of the convention circuit. Luke Indiana (so named as a deliberate pastiche of Luke Skywalker and Indiana Jones, for reasons DeCampi goes into in the afterword) is an actor whose star has well and truly faded, and attends every convention he can because it’s the only way he can make money. Lily is an obsessed superfan of Luke’s old TV show, and Luke’s character in particular. In the words of Avril Lavigne, “Can I make it any more obvious?”

The strengths of this book are in its characterization and ambiguity - Luke is very clearly not a good or nice person, but he is sympathetic. He dearly loves his kids despite a bad track history with them, and his marriage has collapsed but the blame does not lie squarely upon him. Similarly, Lily is obviously mentally unwell, but unlike Misery’s Annie Wilkes, she isn’t a cartoonish monster with no irredeemable characteristics. It’s clear her obsession comes from a place of deep loneliness and a desire for closeness with someone other than her unwell mother.

Story-wise, it treads pretty familiar ground but is, in my opinion, compelling written enough that I didn't mind. It provides good analysis of celebrity culture, parasocial relationships, and ageism. 

Erica Henderson’s art is as wonderful as ever. I know her Squirrel Girl work had its detractors but I defy anyone to read this or DM! and argue that she’s a bad artist.

[Petrol Head by Rob Williams & Pye Parr ](https://preview.redd.it/uhoge0qtoc7e1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=399fa65d1ec0f5395a599a62fd29151beab8fc17)

A group of robots race hotrods for the entertainment of humans in a climate-crisis ravaged future hellscape city, one covered in vast domes to protect it from the toxic, nuke-ravaged atmosphere outside it.

When humans’ taste for entertainment moves on from hotrod-racing, the robots are “retired” to a slum at the edge of the city, left to live out their lives in obsolescence.

Then one day, a scientist and his daughter flee the city, into the slums, on the run from the AI that rules the city with an iron fist. A particularly curmudgeonly robot named Petrol Head decides to help them escape.

It’s basically Mad Max meets 2000AD, and it’s every bit as entertaining as that description makes it sound. Pye Parr’s artwork is stellar, Williams’ characters are wonderful, and the story zips along at an appropriately breakneck speed. Here’s hoping this comes back for a second arc soon.

[Precious Metal by Darcy Van Poelgeest & Ian Bertram ](https://preview.redd.it/w7begdgwoc7e1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4acc6c8a634f8a0eebf12e33e191fa271b1b2186)

From the brilliant, twisted minds behind the wonderful Little Bird comes a prequel to that book, set many decades before those events.

Meet Max. Max is a man with a bunch of tentacles in place of his left arm, a memory full of holes and gaps, an alcohol problem, and some deep childhood trauma at the base of it.

He earns a living doing legwork for human traffickers. One mission goes awry when he realizes the cargo is a young boy who reminds him of himself as a child, and also who has some type of psychic and telekinetic ability. Max decides to help the boy, believing that it may be a way to fix the gaps in his memory and help him remember who he is.

And so begins a chase across the universe as tyrannical Christian authority figures and crazy underground cult leaders alike chase Max and the boy.

It’s a big, ambitious sci-fi tale with a clear commentary on religious oppression, body modification and coping with deep trauma, but the *real* draw, as with Little Bird, is Bertram’s artwork. Van Poelgeest gives Betram a rich tapestry to delve into and Bertram goes absolutely nuts with it. I mean, just look at these pages…

[Sample 1](https://i.imgur.com/lVBesLJ.jpeg)

Read it folks, especially if you’re fans of Brandon Graham and Alejandro Jodorowsky. Good story, *marvelous* art.



[Rare Flavours by Ram V & Filipe Andrade ](https://preview.redd.it/l1objrh2pc7e1.jpg?width=1031&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9415d57b1ef18cc867619b980b8b2e06ea995b85)

Rubin Baksh, an ancient demon with an unabashed passion for food, hires a young documentarian named Mo to help him become India’s equivalent to Anthony Bourdain.

And so we go on a journey through India, as Rubin samples delicious food from all over the country, waxing lyrical on the history of each dish and going into great detail regarding the ingredients, the preparation process and the resulting flavours, as Mo films him.

At the same time, Rubin also keeps sneaking off into the night when Mo is asleep, tracking down the people who cooked the food and devouring *them* because, as a reminder, Rubin is an ancient demon.

There are also people hunting Rubin, a pair of strange men with mysterious pasts and great knowledge of mythological demons.

This book begins as it might sound in the above description: For the first few issues, the men hunting Rubin, and Rubin’s night time excursions, take a backseat to the vibe-setting explorations of food and history, with an ongoing plot coming fully into focus at roughly the halfway point.

This is a book that rewards patience, hoping you’ll be hooked on the atmosphere, enamored by the vibrant personality of its central character and fascinated by its culinary and history lessons, enough to wait out the slower pace of its opening chapters.

Those who are hooked and able to give it time to breathe and get on with the plot might well find it as rewarding and rich an experience as I did, but I won’t blame folks who give up on it before that happens. Props to Andrade, now set to become a staple collaborator of Ram’s (they also worked together on the superb Many Deaths of Laila Starr). His depiction of India is a warm, color-rich one that does equally as much work setting the book’s atmosphere as Ram V’s writing.

[Stuck Rubber Baby by Howard Cruse](https://preview.redd.it/fgrklvy6pc7e1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9e7631f1d73ebf017df8a3ab5f639c72b385c28)

The story of a gay man growing up in small-town America during the Jim Crow era.

Cheerful, uplifting stuff for a sunny afternoon's reading!

I kid, of course. It's a semi-autobiographical tale of a young man named Toland, as he grows up struggling with the self-hatred foisted upon him by a culture which abhors him for what he is. He spends roughly half the book deeply closeted, to the point that he actively gaslights himself into thinking he's genuinely romantically in love with his girlfriend Ginger. 

This is, of course, happening against the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement. Toland lives in a small town in the South, and his town is in the grip of protests and crackdowns against African Americans. Toland works as a gas station attendant, but Ginger is a college student and a civil rights activist, so Toland quickly finds himself dragged into her world of violent protests and late nights at black-run jazz bars. There he meets an assortment of different characters - fellow closeted gay men, black activists, a drag performer, the straight black woman who plays piano for the local gay bar and is considered an ""honorary lesbian"", etc. This exposure to different lifestyles quickly causes a change in Toland, as he begins to shed his political apathy and come to terms with his identity.

It's heavy, intense stuff told to the reader from the perspective of an older Toland, who is happily out of the closet and settled with a partner. This actually makes for quite a fun framing device, as it's clear Toland has told his stories to his partner a few times and we see the partner interjecting at multiple points (""Tell them about X, that part's hilarious!"" or ""Wait, are you sure that's how it happened? You told me that part differently...""), adding a playful meta angle to the whole thing.

Cruse has a solid handle on pacing and dialogue and the whole thing is portrayed in alt-comix-style black and white, text-heavy artwork - despite a comparably smaller 200 issue page count, there's a *lot* packed in here and it's well worth the read.

This book is a reissue of a book written in the late 90s/early 2000s. However, , with controversies over LGBTQ+ rights and racial issues being as prevalent as they have been lately, it feels as relevant as ever.



[The Weatherman by Jody LeHeup & Nathan Fox ](https://preview.redd.it/w24tfb9cpc7e1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a283a78f7de5243310b2429ac7628e84401b884)

The pitch: We’re in the future, on a terraformed Mars, where the majority of humanity resides since Earth was rendered inhospitable due to a horrific terrorist attack. 

Our main character is Nathan Bright. Bright is the planet’s number one weather reporter, a happy man with a happy life, an awesome girlfriend, and a cute dog. His life is good. His world make sense.

And then it all stops being good, and stops making sense. Nathan Bright is captured by militia and accused of being Ian Black, the man who carried out the aforementioned terrorist attack, in hiding under an assumed identity.

What follows is a madcap, hyperviolent, morally ambiguous caper with more twists and turns than you can shake stick at. Every time a new question is answered (Is Nathan Bright really Ian Black? If he isn’t, then where IS Black? What exactly did he do?), a hundred new ones come up. 

Especially gripping is the moral conflict at the center of the book. I’m going to provide a spoiler that comes in about half way through the first volume here, don’t click if you want to remain totally fresh: >!It becomes increasingly likely that Nathan really is Ian, but has had his memory wiped and an artificial personality implanted. It’s a situation not totally dissimilar to the 80s action flick Total Recall - with the difference being that Nathan knows right from the start his original personality was a piece of shit, and has to grapple with that reality.!<

This has, for the past five years, been one of the most consistently fun sci-fi books on the market, and now that it’s finally wrapped I heartily recommend it to people who are into that sort of thing. It’s not world-changing, mind-fucking scifi like, say, Nod Away by Joshua Cotter, but it’s a fun, popcorn action-flick of a book with some brilliantly realized characters, a tightly written and unpredictable plot, and awesome, frenetic artwork**.**",8,1734416738.0,graphicnovels,5,0.9,False

[Absolution by Peter Milligan & Mike Deodato](https://preview.redd.it/kvejnu3dnc7e1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dacd66a0352d30c3c18508d822acda279060382)



A woman named Nina livestreams her work through a cybernetic implant in her eye. Through it, she also interacts with her followers, making decisions based on what will please them and raise her score. If what she does isn’t sexy, stylish, entertaining or original enough? She loses points and her “Absolution” score goes down.

The followers cheer her on, or lambast her, based on her performance, some idolizing her, some lusting after her, some hate-watching in the hopes of seeing her fail spectacularly.

The livestream is televised and has industry experts weighing in and commenting on her performance. Those commentators’ input has a notable effect on Nina’s easily manipulated audience and therefore her absolution score, depending on how their criticisms are framed.

One of the industry experts is a pop culture commentator, one is a philosopher, one is an A-lister in the same line of work.

The line of work? Assassination.

What happens if Nina fails and her audience approval score drops below a certain level? Tiny bombs inside her body explode and kill her.

This is, in short, a cyberpunk rendition of The Hunger Games. It’s one told through a lens critical of social media, parasocial relationships and society’s addiction to entertainment at the expense of the humanity of the people entertaining them.

It’s gloriously unsubtle, but as told by a writer as skilled as Peter Milligan it’s still highly entertaining. 

Helping things immensely is Mike Deodato Jr., who has gone from being a middling artist in the 1990s and 2000s to, IMO, one of the most visceral and mesmerizing sci-fi artists in the business. He’s in his element here, depicting Nina’s world as a cocktail of gritty hyperviolence, cyberpunk widgets and angular panel structures.

The whole story happens in an approximation of real time as Nina completes a single mission, then decides to go rogue purely to excite her audience, up her score and potentially save her life.

It’s almost gleeful about how on-the-nose it is, and with its profuse use of current Internet slang (just as an example, commenters using phrase like “STG” and “unalive yourself”) it’s likely to grate on some people and also probably won’t age well. If you’re on board with it, though, it’s a blast.

There is actually a little more to it than just the blood and the social commentary. Nina is a human being and pretty full-fledged character, who goes through a number of emotions and major character moments through this whole thing - her past, how she ended up in this situation, and the emotional toll it takes on her plays a huge part in the story, particularly in the latter half.

So yeah, I had a lot of fun with this comic.

It won’t be for everyone, but if you’re not put off by any of the descriptions I’ve laid out above, it comes recommended.

Here’s something that I’ve not seen very often in a horror story: In the first issue, the first five pages each introduce us to one of the five characters in this book. They also show us, explicitly, these character in their final moments at the end of the story - headless, or dying of blood loss, or crashing a truck into a tree, etc.

Now, that might seem at first like the book is heaping a ton of spoilers right out of the gate and robbing the story of its tension. If we know what happens to all these characters already, why should we get invested in the story?

See, that’s the part I found quite clever - the whole premise of this book is that *nothing*, and I mean *absolutely nothing* is what it at first seems to be. Throughout the story, characters are seeing things in one panel that then turn out to have been their mind (or *something else*) playing tricks on them. 

And that extends to the characters themselves, all of whom have a treasure-trove of secrets and unspoken issues that get quickly unpacked over the course of these three issues. They’re on a fateful trip to a small town in the middle of nowhere because one of them has a new girlfriend, who is a wannabe social media influencer and thinks her ticket to fame is finding alternative, lesser known locations for vacation spots. Why does she choose a creepy old town as her first pick? How did she convince all these people to come with her? Why is this town so creepy? Where are all the residents? How do we get to the point where all of the characters end up in a hacked-up, bloody mess at the end?

None of it is what you expect, including the contexts for each every one of those deaths. This is a really fun twist on the “City kids get trapped in a small town” horror story trope that is genuinely not as predictable as it looks on the surface.

And while I would *love* to delve further into those details and twists and such, I think this book would be a lot more rewarding the less you know about it going in.

[Carl & The Magic Coin by Akil Wilson](https://preview.redd.it/h3n4mb0pnc7e1.jpg?width=1156&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=708fc1163964e5b5d721560b49dc02e929d71cbc)

So, I found out about this one due to people discussing it in r/graphicnovels’ “What Have You Been Reading?” threads and the almost universal reaction to it was, to paraphrase, “this came out of fucking nowhere and now I’m crying”.

It’s the story of a man named Carl and his son, who are in a laundromat, and discover a weird coin. Carl at first assumes it’s a trick coin used to fool the machines into thinking you’re submitting real money. He decides to go ahead and try to use it, aaaaaand... Let’s just say the title of the comic is not a misleading one.

I’m going to stop describing the comic here, because it’s very short, can be read online for free, and I don’t want to spoil it for you. All I’m going to say is that I agree with the general reactions I described earlier, it’s a tearjerker.

[Into The Unbeing by Zac Thompson & Hayden Sherman](https://preview.redd.it/n2zdmfysnc7e1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48f1b1ee687c8310ed6e53a819320135c56e2c03)

Just to set the tone for this book, issue #4 opens with three scientists exploring inside the corpse of a colossal being of unknown origin. One of the explorers has fallen into a pit, and has realized the pit is the giant’s stomach, and now her companions are scrambling to rappel down the side of the stomach and rescue her before the still-active stomach acid dissolves her.

[This is what that looks like.](https://imgur.com/a/7OJqOav) 

There’s obviously more to this book than just “A bunch of explorers dig their way through a giant corpse” - there’s a global disaster happening, to which said corpse’s appearance is somewhat related, and these characters’ reason for being there, which has to do with complicated geopolitics and scientific outreach programs. The characters all have their own motivations for being part of the program and we get in-depth looks into all of them.

And also there’s Hayden Sherman, who is fast becoming one of my favorite current artists in comics - you may recognize him from the comics Above Snakes and Blink, which I have talked about here before. He acquits himself magnificently of the task Thompson sets out for him.

Yes, those details all matter a lot and make this book about more than just a highly unusual excavation/exploration story.

But, really, if “Explorers make their way through an enormous rotting corpse with its own ecosystem” isn’t gonna sell this book for you, I don’t know what else I have to say about it will.

[The Killer by Matz and Luc Jacamon](https://preview.redd.it/nkmgkw24oc7e1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=612325885e6eaf0b13f18da75b56f50cb6986829)

A French comic from the late 90s that was initially published as 13 50-page volumes, but has been collected in a nice, chunky 767-page coffee table book by Archaia.

It’s the story of an initially-unnamed hitman who, after several years establishing himself as one of the best and most valued individuals in his profession, has finally saved up enough cash to retire in a small village in Venezuela.

Problem is, his clients still have use of his skills, and after he gets dragged back to work to do some high profile killings in Central America, he gets swept up in the political ramifications his actions are having and suffers a crisis of conscience. He wants out, the people who pay him won’t let him go, and the people who may be able to help him finally disappear and rest on his laurels have their own agenda that he’s starting to have second thoughts about.

It’s epic, violent stuff, much more cerebral than the initial pitch of “Hitman wants to retire but his bosses won’t let him” may initially come across. It has shades of Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips’ work to it, and I would not be shocked at all to find out that Brubaker took some inspiration from it. I’d recommend it to anyone who’s fans of that duo, or stuff like Greg Rucka’s Queen & Country.

This has also been adapted recently into a film by David Fincher, starring Michael Fassbender. I haven’t seen it, but from plot summaries it appears to be a fairly loose adaptation that tangentially follows the plot of the comic. Maybe it’s worth a look.

[The Mammoth by Paul Tobin & Arjuna Susini](https://preview.redd.it/zqcr39n6oc7e1.jpg?width=437&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9e8031dc3e5abf1a67a93b724afe7b7cade7ccd)

The setting of this story is a valley in the middle of, as one character describes it, “bumfuck backwoods country”.

This valley has been plagued, for years, by unexplained seismic events. It’s nowhere near a fault line and therefore shouldn’t be experiencing earthquakes, yet on one occasion half a town was leveled by one. 

A team of scientists, one of whom was born in the valley, arrives to investigate. In the opening pages of the first issue, we see a member of this team, Olivia, trapped in an old house as it is destroyed around her. We then see Olivia die, graphically, as she is seemingly crushed by an enormous invisible force.

The remaining members of the team are ready to leave, their funding cut off after Olivia’s death. Then Jess, the member of the team who was born in the valley and is revealed to have been Olivia’s secret girlfriend, gets drunk, watches video footage of Olivia’s death, sees a mysterious ghostly figure in the video, and then walks out to find Olivia standing in her back yard.

Olivia is back from the dead, wearing the dress she was buried in, her face half wrecked from the incident. She isn’t speaking, and barely seems conscious, but she makes it clear to Jess that she wants to be followed somewhere. 

And thus Jess and the rest of the team follow her, hoping to find answers to both what happened to Olivia, and what is happening to the valley.

This is atmospheric, tense stuff with some fantastic character writing and cracking dialogue (favorite line: “Don’t start using alcohol as a crutch.” “I’m not, I’m using it as a wheelchair”). In fact it’s that character work which makes this book worth reading as much as the central mystery: Jess and Olivia are the central characters, and though Olivia dies right at the start, we spend a lot of time learning about the two of them and their relationship as Jess copes with her loss and processes what is happening.

Arjuna Susini’s artwork is a little sketchy and inconsistent, but it truly shines when things get nasty and Susini is required to show some wanton environmental destruction.

Now, a quirk of Paul Tobin’s writing is that he always, without fail, leaves things very open-ended after the finale, encouraging the reader to draw their own conclusions without giving concrete explanations. That’s not gojng to be to everyone’s tastes and I thought it worth warning people who were unfamiliar with his work. If that’s not an issue for you, then this comes recommended for fans of cerebral horror. 

[My Favorite Thing Is Monsters Parts 1 & 2 by Emil Ferris ](https://preview.redd.it/9d0qzu59oc7e1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5ec5163a78ddd24fb2e9ef79fb4c5458bfc5c41)

I don’t think there’s really a lot to be said about this that hasn’t already been said by the countless, breathless reviews praising it over the past few years, so I’ll keep my review brief.

Brief plot summary: Karen is a young girl, an outcast with an obsession with horror and monsters, a budding artist, and also a wannabe detective. Her neighbor, a troubled middle-aged woman named Anka, dies by gunshot. It’s ruled a suicide, but Karen believes Anka was murdered, and as Anka was one of the few adults outside her family who treated Karen like a human being and not a freak, Karen is determines to find out what really happened.

The resulting journey Karen goes on leads her to learn about Anka’s dark and depressing past. She also has to compete with other issues like the poor health of her mother, and an ongoing mystery regarding her disappeared father, and a secret being held by her much older brother, Diego, who is basically a third parent to Karen.

All of this is told in the form of scratchy artwork in Karen’s notebook, as she draws sketches of all the characters (interspersed with fantasy interludes, including frequent trips to the city art museum) and notes down her findings.

Long story short: The praise is earned. This is a complex book, a clear labor of love with a hell of a lot of care, time and talent put into it. It’s dense, it’s full of fascinating and fully realized characters, and it covers heavy topics (feminism, homosexuality, the deaths of children, parents and lovers, the holocaust, child prostitution and murder, among many others) with a tender and even-handed touch.

The book particularly shines during the passages where Karen listens to recordings of Anka talking about her childhood, where we find out she was a child prostitute who grew up in Nazi Germany. As you can tell from that sentence, these passages are *particularly* dark, but they're also where Ferris' voice as a storyteller is at its strongest. 

[Ordinary Victories by Manu Larcent ](https://preview.redd.it/sf4cj4ngoc7e1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85f38ab3f7707e1bdd86019b680e6b8170b8d35b)

You ever pick up a book on a whim and it ends up knocking your socks off? I’ve been picking through some Franco-Belgian comics lists recently trying to expose myself to more of them, and this has easily been the best result so far.

It’s a rambling slice-of-life book following a photographer named Marco, as he navigates various transitional phases in his life.

Marco is formerly a war photographer, but has grown disillusioned with “taking photos of corpses and soon-to-be-corpses” and decided to take an extended sabbatical while he decides what new direction to take.

Marco also suffers from crippling anxiety attacks, and has done so since his childhood. The book delves into this, into its possible origins in his complicated relationship with his parents, and also the way it affects every aspect of his life from work to romance and all the way into fatherhood in the final chapter. 

The book is essentially a series of conversations with important people in Marco’s life, punctuated by monologues from Marco musing on related issues. It covers generational guilt, interpersonal relationships, anxiety (there’s one fascinating monologue where Marco talks about his fear of driving on freeways - I’m paraphrasing here but the gist is “everyone is driving in a motorized coffin and you get more and more aware of it the more there are surrounding you”) and a host of other deep and complex topics.

It is also very unflinching about showing the flaws in its characters. Marco is not a perfect man. He is incredibly selfish, and this is shown to be damaging to his romantic relationships, including with Emily, the main love interest. He has a combative relationship with his therapist, and at one point goes on an extended rant defending his addiction to anti-anxiety medication - his belief is that it allows him to control his life even if it doesn’t solve the root problems, so why should he care if it’s an addiction?

But, despite these multitudes of imperfections, Marco *is* willing to change (even if he frequently needs an emotional kick in the head to realize it) and that makes him redeemable and a worthy character around which to center a story. 

This is a beautiful book, one with many profound moments discussing a multitude of difficult topics in very thoughtful ways.

Caveat to that: It is also twenty years old, and as such has a couple of dated moments that are quite ableist. The r-word is mentioned a couple of times, and a child is described as “probably having an extra chromosome” to describe his rough behavior. Those aren’t deal breakers for me and take up two pages out of over two hundred, but I figured them worth mentioning as there are folks who will find that off putting.

[Our Bones Dust by Ben Stenbeck](https://preview.redd.it/toolvqhioc7e1.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bab214e57af8eb56c4bb0a8c919005790a2cb42)

Earth is an apocalyptic hellscape, inhabited by roving gangs of cannibals talking in broken half-sentences reminiscent of popular depictions of Neanderthals'. A nameless child of ambiguous gender falls foul of one of these gangs, stealing some of their water supply. The gang gives chase.

Elsewhere, two aliens (implied to be highly advanced automatons or cyborgs of some sort, it’s never made clear) are on Earth, collecting data. One, named Attis, spots the child and decides to intervene. This is against all protocols and causes conflict with Attis’ partner.

And so, Attis and the child go on the run, from the gang, from the other aliens, and from a third, mysterious and highly violent form of unknown origin.

There’s not a whole lot of plot to these four issues besides the chase. We’re given the bare minimum to explain why the world is the way it is (mostly visual clues and brief points of dialogue alluding to the past), with the primary focus being on the survival of our two protagonists.

This is not a criticism - it’s a pretty thrilling chase, with the contrast between the whimsical nature of Attis and his partner and the brutal, primitive violence of the setting and its human inhabitants being probably the most compelling hook. Attis is given the most development of any of the characters by far. He’s pretty fascinating, being incredibly earnest in his love of humans and his desire to see the good in them despite the horror we see them committing around him.

It turns out later on that he *does* have a legitimate reason for those desires, and the book strikes a very odd note of hope against its bleak backdrop that nevertheless feels earned.

Stenbeck’s art is lovely too, feeling somewhat like a love child of Moebius and Winsor McKay. The angular, clean geometrics of Attis and the shapes he creates provide another notable contrast against the chaotic ugliness of the ruined human world.

[Parasocial by Alex DeCampi & Erica Henderson](https://preview.redd.it/h32x8xumoc7e1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d91b5812bcd97e32ea80af7f1004ba179c8fb891)

The plot to this is essentially an update of a format most famously covered by Stephen King’s Misery: A famous person gets kidnapped by a crazy fan, and has to find a way to escape.

DeCampi takes this framework and applies it to more modern concepts like social media chat rooms obsessing over their idols, and washed up creators working their way slowly down the ranks of the convention circuit. Luke Indiana (so named as a deliberate pastiche of Luke Skywalker and Indiana Jones, for reasons DeCampi goes into in the afterword) is an actor whose star has well and truly faded, and attends every convention he can because it’s the only way he can make money. Lily is an obsessed superfan of Luke’s old TV show, and Luke’s character in particular. In the words of Avril Lavigne, “Can I make it any more obvious?”

The strengths of this book are in its characterization and ambiguity - Luke is very clearly not a good or nice person, but he is sympathetic. He dearly loves his kids despite a bad track history with them, and his marriage has collapsed but the blame does not lie squarely upon him. Similarly, Lily is obviously mentally unwell, but unlike Misery’s Annie Wilkes, she isn’t a cartoonish monster with no irredeemable characteristics. It’s clear her obsession comes from a place of deep loneliness and a desire for closeness with someone other than her unwell mother.

Story-wise, it treads pretty familiar ground but is, in my opinion, compelling written enough that I didn't mind. It provides good analysis of celebrity culture, parasocial relationships, and ageism. 

Erica Henderson’s art is as wonderful as ever. I know her Squirrel Girl work had its detractors but I defy anyone to read this or DM! and argue that she’s a bad artist.

[Petrol Head by Rob Williams & Pye Parr ](https://preview.redd.it/uhoge0qtoc7e1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=399fa65d1ec0f5395a599a62fd29151beab8fc17)

A group of robots race hotrods for the entertainment of humans in a climate-crisis ravaged future hellscape city, one covered in vast domes to protect it from the toxic, nuke-ravaged atmosphere outside it.

When humans’ taste for entertainment moves on from hotrod-racing, the robots are “retired” to a slum at the edge of the city, left to live out their lives in obsolescence.

Then one day, a scientist and his daughter flee the city, into the slums, on the run from the AI that rules the city with an iron fist. A particularly curmudgeonly robot named Petrol Head decides to help them escape.

It’s basically Mad Max meets 2000AD, and it’s every bit as entertaining as that description makes it sound. Pye Parr’s artwork is stellar, Williams’ characters are wonderful, and the story zips along at an appropriately breakneck speed. Here’s hoping this comes back for a second arc soon.

[Precious Metal by Darcy Van Poelgeest & Ian Bertram ](https://preview.redd.it/w7begdgwoc7e1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4acc6c8a634f8a0eebf12e33e191fa271b1b2186)

From the brilliant, twisted minds behind the wonderful Little Bird comes a prequel to that book, set many decades before those events.

Meet Max. Max is a man with a bunch of tentacles in place of his left arm, a memory full of holes and gaps, an alcohol problem, and some deep childhood trauma at the base of it.

He earns a living doing legwork for human traffickers. One mission goes awry when he realizes the cargo is a young boy who reminds him of himself as a child, and also who has some type of psychic and telekinetic ability. Max decides to help the boy, believing that it may be a way to fix the gaps in his memory and help him remember who he is.

And so begins a chase across the universe as tyrannical Christian authority figures and crazy underground cult leaders alike chase Max and the boy.

It’s a big, ambitious sci-fi tale with a clear commentary on religious oppression, body modification and coping with deep trauma, but the *real* draw, as with Little Bird, is Bertram’s artwork. Van Poelgeest gives Betram a rich tapestry to delve into and Bertram goes absolutely nuts with it. I mean, just look at these pages…

[Rare Flavours by Ram V & Filipe Andrade ](https://preview.redd.it/l1objrh2pc7e1.jpg?width=1031&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9415d57b1ef18cc867619b980b8b2e06ea995b85)

  
Rubin Baksh, an ancient demon with an unabashed passion for food, hires a young documentarian named Mo to help him become India’s equivalent to Anthony Bourdain.

And so we go on a journey through India, as Rubin samples delicious food from all over the country, waxing lyrical on the history of each dish and going into great detail regarding the ingredients, the preparation process and the resulting flavours, as Mo films him.

At the same time, Rubin also keeps sneaking off into the night when Mo is asleep, tracking down the people who cooked the food and devouring *them* because, as a reminder, Rubin is an ancient demon.

There are also people hunting Rubin, a pair of strange men with mysterious pasts and great knowledge of mythological demons.

This book begins as it might sound in the above description: For the first few issues, the men hunting Rubin, and Rubin’s night time excursions, take a backseat to the vibe-setting explorations of food and history, with an ongoing plot coming fully into focus at roughly the halfway point.

This is a book that rewards patience, hoping you’ll be hooked on the atmosphere, enamored by the vibrant personality of its central character and fascinated by its culinary and history lessons, enough to wait out the slower pace of its opening chapters.

Those who are hooked and able to give it time to breathe and get on with the plot might well find it as rewarding and rich an experience as I did, but I won’t blame folks who give up on it before that happens. Props to Andrade, now set to become a staple collaborator of Ram’s (they also worked together on the superb Many Deaths of Laila Starr). His depiction of India is a warm, color-rich one that does equally as much work setting the book’s atmosphere as Ram V’s writing.



[Stuck Rubber Baby by Howard Cruse](https://preview.redd.it/fgrklvy6pc7e1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9e7631f1d73ebf017df8a3ab5f639c72b385c28)

The story of a gay man growing up in small-town America during the Jim Crow era.

Cheerful, uplifting stuff for a sunny afternoon's reading!

I kid, of course. It's a semi-autobiographical tale of a young man named Toland, as he grows up struggling with the self-hatred foisted upon him by a culture which abhors him for what he is. He spends roughly half the book deeply closeted, to the point that he actively gaslights himself into thinking he's genuinely romantically in love with his girlfriend Ginger. 

This is, of course, happening against the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement. Toland lives in a small town in the South, and his town is in the grip of protests and crackdowns against African Americans. Toland works as a gas station attendant, but Ginger is a college student and a civil rights activist, so Toland quickly finds himself dragged into her world of violent protests and late nights at black-run jazz bars. There he meets an assortment of different characters - fellow closeted gay men, black activists, a drag performer, the straight black woman who plays piano for the local gay bar and is considered an ""honorary lesbian"", etc. This exposure to different lifestyles quickly causes a change in Toland, as he begins to shed his political apathy and come to terms with his identity.

It's heavy, intense stuff told to the reader from the perspective of an older Toland, who is happily out of the closet and settled with a partner. This actually makes for quite a fun framing device, as it's clear Toland has told his stories to his partner a few times and we see the partner interjecting at multiple points (""Tell them about X, that part's hilarious!"" or ""Wait, are you sure that's how it happened? You told me that part differently...""), adding a playful meta angle to the whole thing.

Cruse has a solid handle on pacing and dialogue and the whole thing is portrayed in alt-comix-style black and white, text-heavy artwork - despite a comparably smaller 200 issue page count, there's a *lot* packed in here and it's well worth the read.

This book is a reissue of a book written in the late 90s/early 2000s. However, , with controversies over LGBTQ+ rights and racial issues being as prevalent as they have been lately, it feels as relevant as ever.



[The Weatherman by Jody LeHeup & Nathan Fox ](https://preview.redd.it/w24tfb9cpc7e1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a283a78f7de5243310b2429ac7628e84401b884)

The pitch: We’re in the future, on a terraformed Mars, where the majority of humanity resides since Earth was rendered inhospitable due to a horrific terrorist attack. 

Our main character is Nathan Bright. Bright is the planet’s number one weather reporter, a happy man with a happy life, an awesome girlfriend, and a cute dog. His life is good. His world make sense.

And then it all stops being good, and stops making sense. Nathan Bright is captured by militia and accused of being Ian Black, the man who carried out the aforementioned terrorist attack, in hiding under an assumed identity.

What follows is a madcap, hyperviolent, morally ambiguous caper with more twists and turns than you can shake stick at. Every time a new question is answered (Is Nathan Bright really Ian Black? If he isn’t, then where IS Black? What exactly did he do?), a hundred new ones come up. 

Especially gripping is the moral conflict at the center of the book. I’m going to provide a spoiler that comes in about half way through the first volume here, don’t click if you want to remain totally fresh: >!It becomes increasingly likely that Nathan really is Ian, but has had his memory wiped and an artificial personality implanted. It’s a situation not totally dissimilar to the 80s action flick Total Recall - with the difference being that Nathan knows right from the start his original personality was a piece of shit, and has to grapple with that reality.!<

This has, for the past five years, been one of the most consistently fun sci-fi books on the market, and now that it’s finally wrapped I heartily recommend it to people who are into that sort of thing. It’s not world-changing, mind-fucking scifi like, say, Nod Away by Joshua Cotter, but it’s a fun, popcorn action-flick of a book with some brilliantly realized characters, a tightly written and unpredictable plot, and awesome, frenetic artwork**.**",6,1734416710.0,comicbooks,1,0.88,False

My name is Mary and I know that what you’re about to read is quite hard to believe but I had to write this and record it for the sake of my husband, his name was Sam and we were a family of three with our beautiful daughter Gina , today i began to clean my late husband stuff from the closet after he passed two years ago it was hard for me but i had to we were moving me and my daughter from our house and moving to another apartment one that smaller and don’t have much rooms , in the middle of the cleaning process a stopped I couldn’t handle that much of feelings returning to me after I put them away and tried to just keep living for me and my Gina my sweet Gina lost her father in a young age and didn’t know why or how but she will know like I have in the right time, I resume my task and at the end I noticed a weird looking book, a dark brown book is it his yes I think I have seen it  before i remembered now he was always looking and writing stuff but didn’t once told me what he was doing with it, i started flipping the pages and basically it was his sorts of diaries but not like he was writing daily no it was different some pages just have few lines and some are really disturbing but I started to understand what was in front of me and all things that happened came to me at once.

i was just a small and shy kid didn’t have much friends but was extremely good at video games in some nights I would have a small feeling that I was being watched but didn’t care about it but in later months it became more stronger and i developed like a sense that I know when someone is looking straight at me and I would know from where and when ,I had this sort of super power I would tell my classmates to look at me and I would know how and from which direction he was looking at me, but in some nights I would have the same feeling but more like closer either when I was awake or just sleeping and the moment I looked towards the direction thinking some one’s there I find myself looking at the walls like a crazy person and when I told my parents they brushed me off and told me to stop staying up late and there’s no one watching you so I believed them and started to ignore that sensation,  but I know deep down that was not true and from there everything was not the same again and my life turned out to be the most horrible thing ever to endure.

After reading that first page i stopped and some memories  came rushing to my head why I didn’t listened to him why i missed all of this, if I cared enough maybe i could helped him,
The first time we met was 5 years ago thinking about it, it wasn’t long ago i miss him we saw each other in a coffee shop that i was working at and he was all by himself and looked very handsome but really tired to me, his eyes were blue and bright but there was something special or may i say different, under those eyes was black bags if i would describe its like he’s never slept a day in his whole life but if I know what i found out now i would  never made that joke, but it’s was the reason we talked that day ,he asked for some coffee and wanted it large and I with my stupid sense of humour said you’re the last person that needs coffee in the world, after we started laughing both it wasn’t a good joke but he laughed so hard I know now he needed to laugh and like they say the rest is history, at first I didn’t notice anything wrong about him, he was a normal guy with a normal life i don’t know what that drove me to him that much but i did love him , after I moved in with him I started understanding why the shadows under his eyes it wasn’t just from lack of sleep but he always keep his home lights on at all times even when he’s trying to sleep but I didn’t bother I was used to sleeping with the lights on 
Because I worked nights shift and slept on mornings, the first few months I didn’t notice anything but some nights I would hear him grunting  in pain and when I asked if everything is alright he said a bad dream but the bad dream kept coming every night and he seemed more in pain every night worst than before i kept asking what was it and he just said normal nightmares but it wasn’t never a nightmares for him, some other nights he would get up screaming at the top of his throat and trembling with fear and I couldn’t help him he just continued screaming,the worst thing is when he wakes up looking towards the wall that was very uncomfortable and horrible thing to see I asked him again about it and tried to help him and talked with a therapist but when he found out he was very upset and that was the first time I saw him angry and I remember what he told me very clearly, NO ONE CAN HELP ME  NOW.


2.1 my hell 

the life I have is not worth living and not in any way normal but the only good and best thing that could happen to me is finding someone to love and care about in the beginning I thought she would leave me because what she saw and heard but she kept trying to help me and continue to support me but there’s no way i can tell her or show her what is happening I wouldn’t let her fell like me or be scared she doesn’t deserve that but if i am writing this to you i guess i wanted in someway to tell you i just hope that I’m not in this world anymore I’m very sorry MARY but i want you to live your life and raise our daughter in peace and away from my suffering,  this is happening it’s not a dream or a nightmare someone is behind it or something I don’t know but it was just a feeling then it turned into reality in these dreams I was getting killed every single day and in different ways every night i don’t know how or why but it’s horrible and painful and I can’t  take it anymore and no one can save me from it,
At times I would wake up tided to a tree and some creatures tall and have a terrifying smile and teeths  like small daggers  in front of me holding knives and laughing at me then they start to cut my skin from my ankles and skinning me alive and it’s very painful more than anything in the world I would feel everything like its was real when they ripped all my skin apart I could fell my insides and my bones and everything was in red and I would wake up from the pain and continue to suffer and scream not knowing what happened and from the fear that it was going happen again and again and again and again different things different times different methods of killing me and to make sure that everything is real there will always bs a scar in the same place that I was stabbed or burned alive or getting beaten to death or getting eaten by some kind of black dogs like monstrosities and I know what the scars are for, to remind me that it wasn’t just a dream,the most scaring thing is the feeling that someone is watching in my nightmares and in front of me every single day making sure that i am suffering and in pain all the time 
Sorry but that’s the truth I know it’s terrifying and horrible but it doesn’t matter anymore I guess. 

3.0 so close 

These passed few months has been the highest and happiest moment that I’ve lived I truly believe that something like this can’t happen to someone like me I tired so hard to push through the pain to make my wife and new and beautiful little daughter happy and didn’t want Mary so worried about me instead of my little butterfly,since she was born i felt different not in a good way but the nightmares were gone and I thought everything would be better than before but that didn’t last for long and things became worse far worse, what happened I don’t know but from there i have experienced something frightening and ugly I can’t even describe it, every time I close my eyes and try to sleep i see yes I’m not Hallucinating i see faces i don’t know why or who’s  faces but it’s different every time and i didn’t realise at first from the fear of closing my eyes but the face were always be dead, every time i try to close my eyes I remember the daed faces and how horrifying these things that are happening to me so to fix this new torture i lernd to love the darkness again to help me rest my body but this wasn’t the end I started to feel the same old sense that something is watching me but this time was unlike the other time this time I know his here and looking at me, 

3.1 the last night 

The sensation became more intense more than ever and I felt that there in front of me was something gruesome and dangerous waiting watching hiding in the dark but I couldn’t see it days weeks and a lot of sleep less nights go by but when my whole world and beloved daughter turned one year something changed in the night and in the dark I began to see a shape first I thought it was a shadow from somewhere but then I realised it wasn’t it was darker than the room and it wasn’t on the wall he would appear for a second then he would disappear, I thought at first it was my mind playing games on me but it kept showing every night and more clearer and define I can see it now he was the one he was watching me all the time he is responsible for everything I started to see him and I wished I couldn’t it was long so long that his back was bending he was taller than the Ceiling his forearms were long and skinny and in the end of it was hand with a terrific needle like fingers he wore a black long coat and the most horrifying and frightening thing about it was the face it was long and had a big black eyes without any drop of white in it but the  mouth was the most terrifying thing I have seen it wasn’t horizontal like any other creature with a mouth no it started from up to down from the place where a normal human have a nose to his chin it was the worst thing that could ever see with my own eyes and I couldn’t grasp what was in front of me what Abomination was standing and looking at me he didn’t move or speak or anything he just stood there watching, and when I got scared and couldn’t keep looking at him I closed my eyes knowing that i will see the faces again but it was less horrifying than what was laying ahead of me but then i heard it and I’m not mad I’m not crazy no He laughed
And I heard it , his laugh was deep and felt almost like a engine sound then I saw it I knew now why he laughed the faces was not other than me all this time it was my face dead and bloody different angles different deaths he knew,he cost me my life he ruined everything , and right there I tried to speak tried to know what I have done to deserve this agony thin he spoke and it was like a earthquake happened he said with his heinous sound، Generations have come and go and you’re debt has not been paid yet, your life is not enough , just a little toy to me and I found another one, then I passed out I don’t know what happened and what he meant but tomorrow i will know everything and I will return to you and my daughter and our life will be the happiest im not going to wait any more.

3.2. Behind the nightmares

I didn’t know I’m sorry Sam I wish that you have told me everything I was going to help you in anyway possible I would do everything to save you i messed you so much ,

What happened to my husband was something terrible I don’t understand it and I don’t know if it was true or not but  He died
Next to me when i called the cops and the ambulance came they told me the cause of the death was a heart attack but after reading that book i don’t now anymore in the hospital the doctor asked me if Sam was having Fights or anything that could cause so much scars and Bruises i told him no at that time i didn’t think about anything I was just in shock i lost my husband and my daughter lost her dad she was just a little girl, I hid that book in a place that nobody can find and I’m not sure if I could tell anything to Gina ever but lately she was having hard time sleeping and some nightmares and I got a bad feeling about it and something inside of me rememberd for some reason Sam so I started digging again in his hospital Files and a picture fell down from between the pages it was a picture of his back why was it here, in it was his back scars the one the doctor asked me about it so I took a look  and what I saw dragged me to my knees there was a word written with the scars and Wounds on his back it was,
GINA.
