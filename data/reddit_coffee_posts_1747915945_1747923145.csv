1ksrnst,https://www.reddit.com/r/Friendzone/comments/1ksrnst/am_i_being_rude/,Am I being rude?,"I’m a [28M] and last year I met this girl [28F] (we’ll call A) at Burning Man while around the Camp I was with.
We first met with a me and few people at the camp were up early recovering and having some breakfast, when she come over and offered if anyone wanted to come to a spa day like camp for a facial and neck massage. Sounded amazing to me but everyone else just wanted their food then wanted to get some more sleep in, so I was the only one who went off with her, ended up getting to know each other a bit while waiting for our turn for our Spa then she hit me with “a few at camp have said you’re a genuine nice guy so I’m happy you decided to come” I didn’t take much to it at the time even when she is quite a looker but I’ve had some nasty experiences in my life and have adopted a Asexual life style and take things very slow, so I never try to give off a vibe of sexual interest by flirtatious remarks or getting to close physically like looking into eyes, and always hugging around the upper body. Ended up having a great relaxing session having fans blowing with a water mist which was perfect for the hot conditions, so to be nice appreciated her for taking me out of camp to something that wasn’t drug heavy or music related was a nice change of pace, so I mentioned a few camps I’d been to far and if she was interested in me taking her to them.
The Idea of Vietnamese Iced coffee peeked her interest and plus I was keen on waking myself up a bit too.
Ended up having more of a genuine chat waiting for our coffees before making our way back to our camp.

Now its around Lunchtime and gets to the hottest time of day so don’t really wanna be moving around too much, plus being caffeinated and riding around a bit the same morning you wanna keep it on the relaxed side to keep your head for the night where Burning Man comes truely alive.
So I made myself some lunch which was just a quick canned chilli and was very relaxing having no one else around so I could finish my food without interruption (little selfish like that) when “A” comes out from her car with nacho chips and some sour cream dip, which was her lunch, seeing I was having chilli she offered some chips to complement the chilli which I being a bottomless food pit (which the whole camp loved to call me blackhole) I was happy for the addition. Burning man is a gifting society so I didn’t take notice to a lot of these early signs, so to be nice I had some Capri Sun (I’m Australian and heard these were amazing so I bought a whole box load from Walmart as a way to gift to the camp as well as these bracelets which I’ll get into) and offered it to her, her eyes lit up as apparently loves Capri Suns and wished she could find some around at any of the camps and using the IBurn app (a way of using tag words to find camps with certain aspects you’re looking for) she was unable to find a food/drink camp that had some. Sitting across from each other at the dining area table she got up to come around and hug me with the breasts on the back on the head I played it off pretty casual with a “No worries, take it as a thanks for today”.

After lunch she went off to the toilet and in that time I’ve packed my stuff up and moved over to this shaded hammock and deck chair area which I found to be way more cooler than inside my Car with the midday sun. Picked a deck chair and lounged out with my hat over my face having a great start to my day but needing a bit of a snooze to be ready for 7pm onwards for the night shenanigans.
 Having the hat on my head I can’t see but hear someone come over pick up a deck chair and chilled out next to me, about an hour or two pass before I wake up from my snooze needing the bathroom when I noticed the one who move closer to me was “A” ,a few other people had congregated over but all spaced out in their own positions some next to each other like couples and close friends but we seemed to be in our own spot against this container.
Still not thinking to much of it I finish up at the bathroom and head back over to the chill area when someone else goes and takes my spot no issue, but “A” peaks her head out from under her hat and noticed I wasn’t me and gets up to turn around and see me walking back into camp, greets me and follows me over to the couch part of this chill area as I needed to apply some moisturiser to combat the dusty/dry conditions. She asking if she could use some too and starts applying the same as me, but her having an exposed back with her outfit asks if I could apply some to her back. Now this was the point when I realised that she was interested in me, the actions leading up to it were becoming obvious to my oblivious nature, so to not be rude especially to someone who has only done kind things to me and wanting to keep in platonic I moisturise her back and started a conversation that went deeper into ourselves so I could try and build around these feelings she was having and so I could explain my position.

Turning out she broke up with an Ex about 2 months prior to Burning Man and had dated for something close to a year and I explained my situation of being quite reserved after my situation (which no need to get deep into here) she found it refreshing to hear that someone was happy to take things slow to build a foundation before going down a intimate path as not to build feeling that’d just be broken down. Being a cool chick and not emotionally attached to their ex like some girls, I found she would have been a pretty nice fit for me as a friendly companion for the rest of the Burning man with 5 days left till the “Burn of the Man”.

After our long talk it hit that time for dinner, I had a tuna rice setup which went down well and her I can’t remember but she had these Seaweed chip things that she offered and went down so well with my meal, so again offered her a Capri Sun just on fair gifting. 

When we were almost finished a few of these lads I’d been partying with the last couple of days had finally woken from their slumber ready for the next round of Bass Hunting (we’d ride our bikes hearing the bass come from the sound stages and chase the dirtiest one). Hearing of our adventures a few other camp members wanted to join in so we ended up with a sizeable crew including “A” and a few of her girl friends she’d made at the camp. 
Before starting we got everyone on the same page which was to have a Leader and follow the leader to their desired Bass, Art piece or general direction the festival took them until we arrived where they felt their calling. Having a large and diverse group lead to some unique places that with the Lads I went out with the first few night wouldn’t have chased.
80% were sound camps which we’d spend a good 15-20 minutes before picking another leader and going with their gut. Having a large group meant we kinda had our own exclusive club circles at each sound camp where we were all just dancing together. Now I’m a bit of a mad dancer and love to throw my body to the music, I have too much fun and seemed “A” was that kind of way too. Was even hilarious this guy came from behind her trying to grind up and she just pushed him away so roughly, classic!

As the night went on the group slowly shrunk as people were wearing themselves out to the point it was just me and the 3 lads and “A” and one of her girl friends left. Now it was “A’s” friends turn to be leader and she had a this camp in mind which was a secret club camp that she’d been lucky to get the directions for (BM has a clock like structure to it and all camps are on the clock with a Letter so example 9:20 C etc) 
Now the lads weren’t really into it as this was my first BM and they’d been rather stay on the outer clock for the more doof doof music rather than RNB which there wasn’t much of but this was a hidden camp so kind of exclusive. Being my first time I was happy to change it up and experience as much as possible. So it ended up just being Me, “A” and her Friend that went to this club, it was setup like a small carnival tent probably able to hold 30-40 people and it was packed to the brim, and after having a scout around I found a hidden entrance round back that could squeeze us in. 
Now being quite tall at 6’5 I was able to see I bit of an opening spot we could’ve gathered around in after squeeze past a few people, I had “A” hold on tight with her Friend holding her tight as I navigate them to this spot. This tent was so packed it was hot and music was blasting so this back spot was a lot easier to chat rather than being crammed up dancing. “A” wanting to dance I found this large square couch piece and said she can go on top and if she felt like she was gonna fall then to fall in my direction and I’d catch her so she didn’t hesitate to jump up and dance her heart out. Now while she was facing the DJ direction her friend pulled me down to ear level and let me know “A” was interested in me but I was putting the moves on her, I quickly explained I take things pretty slow and got slightly scolded for it but she understood but explained that Burning man is a short event then I’d be heading back home to Aus so try to convince to have fun while abroad and expressed interest in me and complemented me on my Ripped Back (which honestly I though my back was ok 🤣) after hearing that “A” had a wobble and I knew she was going to eventually fall so had my hands on her side and slowly carried her down, she mentioned the heat of the place was way worse up high and why she just had to get down but thought to be cheeky and get me to carry her down.

At this time it was quite late getting close to 6am almost starting having light come over the mountain so we decided to finish up and head back to camp. Rather than ride our bikes back as it would have been a short 5-10 bike ride, we just walked our bikes so we could have some drunken banter.
Once we made it back to camp and locked the bikes up I was happy to finish up and back to my car for the night, but “A’s” friend asked what should we do now, so to be a friendly as possible without being blunt did a classic yawn and “it’s getting pretty late I should get some shut eye, want to be fresh for another packed filled day”. “A” and her friend quickly whisper to each other and “A” asks what kind of setup I’ve got in my van and if it has a decent mattress as hers is just a average pump up mattress and her friend is in a tent with a cot. Now I know straight away what was up and try and clear the room with I’m happy to have you girls in the Van but I’m only looking to sleep but since it does get cold I’ happy to do some light cuddling. BM when the sun goes down does get quite cold and I wasn’t really prepared for it expecting it to be warm, but I did have a warmer quilt for when I was travelling around Reno prior to BM, but the few nights at the start of BM I got cold to the point of putting my jumper on so I asked if they have another sheet to put in to warm it up a bit. After we all organised ourselves we met a my van and let them in for the night, they wanted me in the middle and the body warmth was quite comforting compared to the cold nights in my jumper so I couldn’t complain until “A” and her friend started to get a bit more handsy and tried to get more intimate than I was wanted especially this quickly so I nicely ask if we could just for the night cuddle and we can talk more about it tomorrow. “A” was a bit more understanding than her friend who had a bit of a rejection reaction before sighing and cuddling up even closer. I end up in a spoon position with “A” in front of me and her friend behind and end up sleeping to about 10-11am.

In the morning being a bit later than I usually wake up the girls are still wanting a bit of a rest so I head out to have my breakfast. Later in the day while I’m having a chat with a few camp members around the chill area around 12ish is when both girls leave the van and head to their tent and car to grab some food. When the people I was talking to noticed this they immediately jumped to conclusions calling me a sly dog, and my Reserved nature was for show, which did get me a bit flustered cos there was no way to explain that properly and hard to believe 2 girls and a guy in a van were just “cuddling”. Having “A” and her friend come over after lunch immediately were hit with “sooo what were you doing in the van last night, this one reckons you were just cuddling”. Happy they cleared the air and clearly said it was a more comfortable bed compared to what they had to offer and if I’m comfortable to join in again. Because I didn’t want to give them the wrong message, sex for me is so hard press unless it’s a romantic relationship rather than a fling or fuck buddy situation in my current mind state, so I pulled them aside to come to juice bar which a nice 10-15 minute walk away.

After explaining again to “A” but in more depth and now having her friend up to speed they seen where I stood. “A’s” friend was a bit younger I think 25-26 and was just looking for fun with no strings attached which sadly was the opposite of what I was looking for so she ended up still hanging around as friends but she was kinda on a mission to find some chill guys to screw around and not have to deal with connections and sadly I wasn’t going to give her that and she was a beautiful Hawaiian background American with perky tits and a gorgeous 5’4 fit frame but I just have to have a connection to get me excited so it couldn’t work out, but the remaining days and nights still had a chat and went out another 2 times and she did try again to get my attention but didn’t work. 

Now “A” was the only girl who wasn’t just trying to do the Festival fling like some girls were and was taking her time to get to know me, but still on that first day she definitely came on to strong and I hate to be rude but to bring up your Ex to someone you’re having a good time with and saying you’re this and that better in comparison is not the best thing to say to a guy like me, past is the past and live for the moment and build on what we have is my mentality and told her this nicely which is why we ended up stay around each other and let her sleep in the van. But I was using her a female deterrent so it looked like I was taken to make it easier, as I came to BM for fun and to make lasting friendships so I could come back to do it all again with them (like I am this year) the last thing I expected from my trip was a sex trip and “A” was relatively respectful of that but she definitely had a few cheeky moments on pretending to grind up on the dance floors or grind up in the van and even one hug she put her arms around my neck and tried to bring me down for a kiss, her being 5’9 meant I could keep my distance that K felt comfortable with.

Now with everything you’ve heard I’m taking it slow and shes being the most respectful she can with only a bit of want(don’t wanna say desperation) that she can’t hide. So why have I not wanted to take things further, I’m from Australia and she’s Canadian so very big distance issue and I can’t get attached to someone I could only see once a year for a festival I reckon she’d be trust worthy but at the time I wasn’t sure how it could work. 

The end of BM is nearing as the Man and the Temple have burned, we’ve packed up camp and it’s the last night before morning comes and we drive away from the desert. So I bring it up with “A” on if we took this further how would it work. She definitely said some things I can relate with but it still couldn’t fix the huge distance between our homes, she was happy to video call and keep in touch as much as possible as she mentioned me as the most sweetest guy show didn’t use her and even brought up I could’ve easily had a threesome but wanted something deeper and that struck something with her. Seeing how much she felt for me and respected my feelings on the last night we ended up making out for a while and she did make moves to show she wanted more but I just couldn’t knowing it was over after that nice and wanted to see how she’d go with distance, so we just had a intimate make out for a while before cuddling up for the last time before morning. We got up early to beat some of the crowd and give each other one last big hug and a cheeky kiss before saying our last in person goodbyes, making sure to have each others WhatsApp to keep in contact.

3 months pass and we had been chatting at least once to twice a week and was quite cute but I had started at this point almost treating this like a really close friend rather than a future relationship. I started to allow myself to see other women and take my time getting to know someone and I did this without telling “A” and not telling her I see her more of a close friend than anything else only because of the distance 😔 In between the 3 and 4 month mark I had started to see this one girl and it was working for a while before it didn’t work out as we wanted different things for our futures and I this is why I’m happy to take things slow and the separation process is easier if you’re not going in too quickly. Deciding to want to take a break I left myself more reserved and kept in contact with my BM friends and with “A” to occupy my free time. I mostly had chats with “A” about travelling how maybe shes not going to be returning to BM this year since shes got another holiday planned in October with a motorbike trip around Mexico. I said it was sad I wont be seeing her a BM and considered making a detour after this years BM to stop at Canada to catch up as I thought our friendship was too good to just have it as 5 days at a festival then been in contact on messages and video chats.

The next day is when I suggested we do a quick road trip together around May/June/July this year before I get organised for BM and her with her Mexico trip. After back and forth we decided on Iceland as a destination we both are interested in and perfect for a road trip so we organised this in December last year. We’ve been keeping in plenty of contact organising what to bring and getting our van, hotel stays and pre booking activities.

Now this is finally where we get to the last few weeks leading up to our Trip where we both arrive in Iceland in 2 weeks time. Now being in Canada theres a big time difference where almost when I’m asleep shes awake and when shes asleep I’m awake unless we stay up late or get up early. I’ve been loving how slow we’ve taken everything and I’d assume we’d bring this up when we see each other at least after a few days, but she just dropped a bomb on asking what I think of her as. This was a video call so hard to not show emotion but I told her along the lines of; I’m happy to explore how our futures can work together but at the moment with our living situation you’re like a really close friend and don’t want to ruin that, but if we can make it work I’m happy to take it further. You could see it wasn’t quite what she was wanting to hear. For the remainder of the video chat it definitely shifted in tone but eventually after explaining more carefully she started to understand (I think). 


This is the question I wanted to ask before seeing her in person is have I done her wrong by keeping her in a friendzone till we can make a future with our distances work and not spends thousands a year just to see each other in person. One thing she brought up was taking it slow is good but theres a point when its too slow, but I try explaining its because where we live I don’t want to get attached so something I can’t easily seen in person.

I know this is a lot  and I do thank anyone for taking the time to read but it’s to try and paint a picture so I can ask “am I wrong for going about this way?”",1,1747922957.0,Friendzone,0,1.0,False

When I search online, I only see comments about how to make the lights go off, but those solutions don't seem to work for mine,



I noticed it wasn't brewing as much coffee, and then the machine says it's time to descale. I order the descaling kit and get started. It's worth noting that I had previously tripped the thermostat when I stupidly put a cup in and hit brew without there being any water in the reservoir. For the record, the top never said - and has never said - ""add water.""

1. I started descaling just by ""brewing"" cups. This was my mistake. About halfway through, I went online and learned that there was a ""descaling"" process. I put the machine into descaling mode.
2. The machine finishes out the solution reservoir. I fill it back up and continue the descaling process.
3. Online, it says the machine should show ""add water"" on the screen when the descaling process is complete. It runs through a full tank of water, then tries to draw when there wasn't enough in the reservoir to finish the cycle. Trips the thermostat and shuts the machine down.
4. I take it apart and reset the thermostat. When the machine comes on, it's flashing ""descale"" on the screen again.
5. Alright, so let's take it from the top. Power the machine off, put it in descale mode. I run through 4 full reservoirs and it's still in descale mode. I can't power it off. Holding the buttons to put it into descale mode do nothing.
6. I unplug it for an hour or so, thinking it'll reset the system. Plug it back in, flashing descale again.

**Me:** For over a year— irrespective of market conditions and FUD—**the Kendu community kept showing up.**

1ksrhjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1ksrhjw/i_cant_believe_people_like_this_exist/,I can't believe people like this exist,"So there is this girl in my college that I had a crush on, we had been talking for quite some time and I thought she was interested too so I asked her out on a coffee date but I guess I misread the situation and she declined. I texted her ""That's fine, feel free to message me if you change your mind :)"" and left it at that. 


Fast forward 2 days, one of her friends sends me a screenshot of her bashing me for being short (I'm 5'7) . Apparently she rejected me for being short (which I am totally fine with) but she followed by saying that ""I will never date a short elf like him"" which obviously didn't sit well me. I asked her friend if it is fine with her if I confront her with this screenshot and she said she is fine with it.


So against my better judgement, like the idiot that I am, confronted her for saying such a thing to which she responds and I quote ""I don't go pity dates. I don't owe you any explanation for rejecting you. You're so insecure about your height that you messaged me about it, I bet you have a small d*ck too because you give off that kind of energy 💅💅"" 

When I saw that text, I instantly blocked her. I knew talking to her was pointless. I knew some people care about height and there is nothing wrong with that, but do they forget that those who don't fit their preferences are humans too? I have no problem with her rejecting me for my height or not explaining me why she rejected me, It's her choice but to say degrading things like ""short elf"" and ""small  d*ck energy"" is just ..., I don't know. 

This happened to me 2 weeks ago and this is still on my mind since then, I know I shouldn't be posting on this subreddit since this is a women centric space and the mods can feel free to delete this post if they want but I just wanted to rant about this shit

Orthodox fasts are up to 6 hours if it's an evening liturgy, or from midnight til morning liturgies.
They do not have mass everyday like catholics, so it's usually a Sunday thing.

Catholics have mass everyday, hence the rules are different  - which I understand. Obviously you cannot fast everyday.

But my heart does. Not. Understand. That.

1 hour is nothing and does not even feel like a fast. 

Coptics have 3 hours fasts.

I want to attend evening mass and I feel like the greatest traitor before God, because I find myself too weak to fast for 6 hours. I then try  to settle for 3 hours but I often miss the time. Around 3pm (having eaten only breakfast and coffee) I get so hungry, and I know it's 3 hours left to mass. 

I FORCE myself to eat a lot in the morning, so that I can attend mass having fasted more than 3 hours, because anything beyond that feels unacceptable. 

But I fail.
Every. 
Single.
Time.

I eat a meal, I drink my coffee. Then the day passes by faster than I can count. I look at the clock and see it's 3pm (3 hours left to evening mass at 6pm).

And I feel like: ""Oh no, I cannot eat anymore! But I am so hungry...""

And literally everyday for the past few months has been a battle over waiting for the Most Holy, Most Sacred and Blessed Thing in the world, or eating a meal to fix my hunger. 

If I don't eat I am murmurring, I get weary, I cannot even stand the thought of the Holy Eucharist being the most glorious thing in the world because all I think about is food.

But if I DO eat, I feel like I have traded God like Esau did, for some short meal, which means zero to me.

And almost everyday I lose. And then I never attend mass. I tell myself: ""Tomorrow I'll do better"" but I never do better.

This has been my battle for the last few months everyday. ",0,1747922459.0,Catholicism,0,0.5,False
1ksrgiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ksrgiy/does_waterdrop_wdpfal_filter_improve_coffee_taste/,Does Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Filter Improve Coffee Taste Review Unveils Actual Benefits?,"The Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Replacement Alkaline Filters are designed for anyone looking to improve their water quality without breaking the bank. Equipped with advanced technology, these filters fit seamlessly into all Waterdrop Pitcher Filtration Systems, offering a simple, efficient way to enjoy clean and alkaline-filtered water at home. I spent several weeks testing this product to see if it lived up to the hype and was impressed with its performance—but as with any product, there were a few quirks to note.

**Design and Compatibility**  
The build of these filters stands out immediately. Crafted with a combination of activated carbon, resin, alkaline material, and carbon fiber, the materials feel premium and well-engineered. The lightweight design (1.3 pounds) makes swapping old filters for new ones ridiculously straightforward. I tested them with different Waterdrop pitcher models, and the fit was perfect every time. They’re compatible with models like WD-PT-05, WD-PT-07, and even the WD-PT-61B, so flexibility is a huge strength of these filters. However, I found the instructions on the box to be quite basic—it’s manageable, but some might wish for a bit more clarity.  
[See Waterdrop WD-PF-AL price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b096xrty3m/)  

**Performance and Water Quality**  
The performance of the filters surprised me with how effective it was at improving water quality. Using a six-stage filtration system, it does a stellar job removing fluoride, chlorine, and heavy metals. Testing showed the water tasted significantly fresher without that weird metallic aftertaste I usually get from the tap. What really sold me was the alkaline water benefit—according to Waterdrop, it raises the water's pH to 8.0-9.5. I found that after a few days of drinking this filtered water, my coffee tasted smoother and less acidic, which is huge for a caffeine addict like me.

**Upsides**  
- Produces healthier alkaline water with added minerals, such as calcium and magnesium.  
- Improves coffee flavor and balances acidity while subtly enhancing natural sweetness.  
- Filters up to 100 gallons of water with each unit, making it efficient for long-term use.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Instructions for filter replacement could be more detailed for first-time users.  
- It’s worth noting that while advanced, the filters are not compatible with non-Waterdrop pitchers.  

**Effective Filtration at its Core**  
The cutting-edge filtration technology impressed me. The activated carbon fiber (called ACF) is said to be ten times more absorptive than ordinary filters, and my personal experience validates this. Water looked clearer, tasted better, and didn’t have that tap-water smell. The speed of filtration also shocked me; the 0.3gpm flow rate provided fresh, filtered water faster than I expected. Even when the pitcher was almost empty, it maintained consistent quality with no noticeable slowdown.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
While there are other options, such as Brita and PUR, Waterdrop offers something unique in its inclusion of minerals and alkaline properties. Brita, for instance, focuses mainly on chlorine reduction, and PUR specializes in heavy metal filtration, but neither offers the extensive mineral boosting and pH balancing you get here. However, Brita’s filters are slightly easier to find in stores, making them faster to replace in a pinch. Still, Waterdrop has an edge for those prioritizing better-tasting coffee, tea, and healthier drinking water.

**True Value**  
Considering the features, the filters are absolutely worth it. You’re not just getting clean water; you’re drinking water that contains essential minerals like zinc, selenium, and even iodine—trace elements many other filters don't add back. While I can't mention specific prices, the cost-to-value ratio feels balanced compared to what competitors are asking for less technology. If long filter life and fast flow rates aren’t enough to justify the price, the health benefits of alkaline water might seal the deal for you.

She did the same thing again later, saying her sandals were hurting her feet, so she placed her bare feet on my legs.

To make things more complicated, my mom looks quite young for her age. People sometimes think she’s my girlfriend, which makes these moments even more uncomfortable and embarrassing for me.

I know I can say no and sometimes I do but when I refuse, she starts crying and tells me how much she loves me. I can’t stand seeing her cry. She’s a very emotional woman. Whenever I give in and let her do these things, she gets happy like a little girl.

My second recipe I winged it- 1 cup cream, 1 cup whole milk, ~1/3 cup sugar, ~3 tbsp milk powder, a healthy pour of instant coffee, vanilla extract and salt. Added chopped vanilla meringue for mix in. Also tasty, no big issues.

My only complaints with my first two batches was that I felt flavors could have been deeper? Even though I'm not doing a custard base, is this a good reason to pre-mix and let my base sit overnight in fridge anyways?

My final batch was just milk! 1 cup of milk, a bit less than 1/4 cup of honey, 1 tbsp vanilla, a 3 tbsp milk powder (was trying to make up for the recipe risk by increasing proportion of milk powder ?) And salt. The result was creamy and delicious!! Actually my favorite flavor eise! Why is everyone so insistent on needing cream, stabilizers etc etc when i made a perfectly serviceable ice cream with only milk, no eggs, etc?

I don't know why or how, whenever I study I feel sleepy, intensity varies from what I've noticed it's after a meal ,and when I didn't sleep well at night.

In my last term exams I didn't have breakfast for like  3months, because normally I feel sleepy but after a meal it's too much and I just can't resist it no matter what I do standing, walking  eating ,tea ,coffee all don't help.
Im feeling so low because I have exams in a month and my entrance exams for post grad will be in 2yrs and I have to study really hard for it from now on.
Like
 I'm ready to put in effort, hardwork I'm ready to put in hours but here I just can't seem to do it.
For example:Out of like 3hrs of studying I feel sleepy for atleast 1hr 

I sleep for 5..6hrs and after that I just wake-up somehow and just cant seem to fall asleep, and once the day starts even If I take naps they don't help .

Some saw it as the Armageddon, some saw it like a scene from a comic, some saw it as the arrival of a god. People cried out in excitement at the fantastical affair, others though, mourned the sacrificed ones. But more than anything, the masses were filled with awe. And as awe always is, it evolved into fear in some and worship elsewhere. 

That Monday, I was sitting in front of my TV, watching a rerun of some crime show when a shadow loomed over my balcony window. It wasn’t the soft darkness of a heavy cloud, it was a sudden pitch darkness as if the sun had been swallowed. Soon followed the earthquake, a harsh shaking ending uncharacteristically crisp. Like a sudden crack. 

So I walked to my balcony, looking out towards what used to be the city centre. Now a foot covered the land, wide enough to cover the whole area, and the leg rising up to the sky, the knee barely visible in the cloud. A pillar of shadow lay deep through the city as the sun was covered by the leg. From the distance, another crack could be heard. Then stillness. Quiet. 

Chaos reigned that day. And the day after. And the week after. And the month after. Only after a year has passed did a semblance of normalcy return. But never fully. Never fully. 

It’s been almost two years now since that day, next week would be the second Day of the Return celebration. This year, once again, I am reminded of a story my grandmother once told me. My grandmother, she told me that long ago, giants ruled the world. They didn’t come from earth like the other animals, they came from another world and arrived here looking for a new home. These giants lived on our world for thousands of years, creating the structures we call mountains and canyons today. 

Now the Queen of the Giants was a storyteller, and she would write stories on the skies at night, stories we now see as constellations. My grandmother always said that the stars used to be brighter and more numerous than it is now. There used to be hundreds and thousands of stories written across the sky. But now we can only read a few of them when we look up at night. Maybe the stars died, she would ponder, or perhaps the Queen is planning on writing new stories.

Her greatest story was that one day the giants will leave to go back to their home world one last time, and when they leave, the world will welcome new rulers who will decide whether to accept the giants back once they return in the future. As the Queen foretold, the giants disappeared one day without a trace. Soon after, the first humans appeared. 

It was just a folk story from her village, but I couldn’t help wondering how much of it felt true right now. The giant’s leg in the middle of the city hasn’t moved an inch in the last two years, and yet any attempt to go up above the knee has resulted in the drones being crushed mysteriously. Governments and scientists have been uncharacteristically hush-hush about any information they have on the giant, only telling people instead to stay away from it as far as possible. 

It was hard to think about the size difference between us and the giants. I heard it was said that the ratio of a human’s height to its foot length is roughly six or seven times the size. The giant’s foot is approximately one kilometre long, which means that a good estimate of its height would be six kilometres. Now let’s say that the average height of a human is one-hundred and seventy centimetres tall, that would mean that the giant is about three-thousand five-hundred times larger than us. That would be the size difference of the average human to the average tardigrade. I, for one, am certain that I would hardly realize the existence of tardigrades if not for science textbooks. It would be strange to think others will.

So what exactly does this mean for us, the existence of these giants? I don’t really know what I should think. I know I’m not crazy like the Returners who come each Monday to kiss the giant’s foot and burn chicken livers, of all things, next to it. In a way, I guess the giant also confirms the existence of alien life. But who are these aliens? Were they the gods of old? Was one of them our Prometheus? Perhaps it was like in Taking Care of God, and they came to give us technology instead. 

Yesterday, I took the taxi back home from work; my mother needed to borrow my car for a trip outside the city. The day was too rainy to walk home. It was all gloom and doom ever since the morning, like the cloud wanted to rain but was holding it all in. It finally relieved itself just before noon. The driver, this old man with a silver tooth, told me that there was a traffic jam near the flyover. 

“Packed as sardines those cars there. This huge ball of water fell on some dumb truck and caused a crash. Everyone’s just trying to figure out what the hell’s happening out there. That ain’t no raindrop, I tell you. No, it was bigger than a car, that raindrop it was.”

“What do you think it was?”

“My guess? It’s the giant’s tear. Poor thing must’ve done something wrong and shed himself some tears. This rain today, that’s the giant’s tears causing those clouds. People think that giant right there is some sort of untouchable creature who can’t get hurt. No, that creature there is sentient. It has emotions. But that’s what I think at least, it has emotions. It could always be some sort of weather freak show too, could it?”

“I’m not sure, can a weather freak show cause that?”

“You’re barking up the wrong tree, kid. If I knew better about the weather I’d be a forecaster instead of a taxi driver, would I?”

“Who can say? There are amateurs who could explain topics better than professionals.”

The driver barked in laughter, “I wish, kid. I wish”

I sat through the rest of the drive silently until we reached my apartment. 

“Keep the change.”

“Bless you, kid. Bless you.”

I got in, took a shower. Grabbed a cup of coffee, and turned on the news. There it was, once again, on the TV. A newscaster was getting close to the giant’s foot. The Returners were kissing the foot as usual, some of them covered in some red liquid. Two policemen were dragging a drunk with a bucket of rotten tomatoes, of all things, away from the scene. And out of nowhere, the ground started rumbling. The newscaster tumbled, trying to grab onto something for balance. The Returners retreated, running away from the very thing they were worshipping just moments ago. The policemen froze, mouths agape as the drunk hollered at their direction. 

It was surreal, once again, like the Day of the Return, to see the giant flex its toes. I leaned forward in my seat, my half-empty mug hanging precariously in my left hand. My other hand grabbed the remote to turn up the volume of the TV. I could hear the hysterical pinging notifications from my phone, but I couldn’t care less about it. This was the first movement we saw in almost two years since its arrival. Two years!

Slowly, really slowly, the giant lifts up its foot, the camera creeping up to follow the movement. And the feed disconnected.

1ksr4p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1ksr4p4/needing_rest_time_in_between_tasks/,Needing rest time in between tasks,"Does anybody else have this problem where you need to take frequent breaks and sometimes rest between tasks instead of immediately moving onto the next one? I’m in college right now and this is a major problem. 

Most people I know study in eight hour blocks. I’m pretty sure these people don’t take more than one break, usually not longer than about 10 minutes. I wear out way too fast. Usually I have to take a 15 to 20 minute break every 2 1/2 hours or so and it takes forever for me to complete my work. 

I’ve tried doing it however everybody else does it but it’s like if I focus on one thing for too long, my brain just stops working. I start making too many mistakes, reading the same line over and over, or I just get stuck on something and wind up getting less done than I would have if I had just taken the damn break.

It’s not just studying this causes a problem with though. It’s life in general. Everybody expects you to constantly be busy all the fucking time. It’s really annoying. Let’s say you’re home from work or classes. You’re not allowed to just relax. There’s always something else you need to be working on and if you take any time at all to just rest, you’re the worst person in the world. I don’t know how people do it because I don’t have that much energy. I burn out very easily if I am forced into a lifestyle that is go go go all the time.

I thought this was normal, but my mom says a sign of autism. I cannot stand being around her for many reasons. One of them is that she needs activity packed into every second of the day. When I lived with her, I didn’t have time for hobbies or even just to rest. She had to have every single hour meticulously planned out into some kind of activity. It felt like I was at summer camp or something. She’s a big believer in the saying “idle hands do the devil’s work.” When I’ve tried to explain to her why I need breaks, she says that’s what sleeping is for and that every waking second you need to be working hard and doing something productive. 

I can’t live like that. I don’t live with her anymore, but I am still in contact with her and God forbid she gets wind of the fact that I’m spending my day off, resting, watching TV, or just going out to do something fun rather than spending the entire day behind my desk, checking my LinkedIn and email. I do check my email on a daily basis, but I’m not obsessive about it. I’ll check it maybe twice a day. She checks it on the hour, she’s always plugged in and wants me to be too. Meanwhile, I’m one of those people who refuses to bring my cell phone to the bathroom. I will use my days off to catch up on household chores and things like that but once that’s done, I refuse to do anything else. 

She keeps telling me I can’t function like this in the real world, but I don’t have the energy to be busy every single second of the day. That’s how things were for me the last three weeks of my spring semester simply because I had an insane amount of work to do, more shifts at work because they’re understaffed, filling out a police report and all that crap. I thought I was going to lose my mind and once all it was over, I actually slept for almost the whole day.

Can people like me actually function in the real world? Because if I have to live the rest of my life like the last three weeks of my spring semester at college, where I was so busy I didn’t even have the time to eat aside from a cup of coffee and a protein bar here and there in my apartment looked like a freaking tornado went through it because I didn’t have time to clean it because I was never at home. I’m either going to go snap eventually or die of stress.

We detested each other at first. Actual tension. She broke her arm and was forced to quit training for a few months. Months went by, and she came back, and by then we had new pals in the class. I started paying attention to her properly. Step by step gradually, we grew closer.

Turned out that we studied in the same institution.
Did projects together relating to karate.
Went through anime with her.
I'd walk her home from school.
We'd call one another every night during Ramadan just to sit and watch TV together. It was one of the coziest, most genuine routines I've ever had with someone.

There were moments of jealousy, jokes between us only, late-night talks, library trips just the two of us.
I felt like we were special. At least, at least that's what it felt like to me.

Then. life got in the way.

Her grandmother died. She started mentioning going away from cities possibly.
Her parents were struggling, even with divorce, perhaps.
The day she told me she might be leaving, I lost it. I just told her, ""Don't forget us… we're close friends.""
She promised: ""I won't.""

She departed.

And from that day on… she gradually faded away.
I'd send her long messages 250 words or more. She'd answer with 50, maybe even shorter.
Emotionally, I stood alone in a space we had built together.

Then one day, without warning, I saw her walking down the street. I didn't even recognize her at first.

I entered a coffee shop and sat by the window.
It was her.

My heart started racing. All the memories hit me at once.
The dreams. The little things. The phone calls. Her scent, even it all came flooding back.
I almost lost it there, with my boys sitting next to me. I didn't like how it affected me.

And the worst of all?

She never even saw me.

That was the last time I ever saw her.

Now, every so often when I'm at the job or in training and I start sweating… I catch a scent that sort of smells like her. And for an instant, I'm back walking with her, those nights of anime, that part of ""us"" which never did receive the proper conclusion.

And I just stand there, frozen in it.
With this sense of losing something that never quite got to be.

The difference between Sema and Mounjaro type drugs with the second molecule is to me at least similar to comparing coffee versus cocaine. 

I can't explain this enough to others that have never experienced any of these drugs before on why Sema doesn't seem strong enough and a lot of people who start these things even the brand name Sema I don't understand in the beginning while why they're not getting the strong results that others talk about like I did.  Increasing the dose does nothing.

As someone always on the lookout for ways to enhance daily nutrition, I decided to give the COUNTRY FARMS N9880 Organic Super Greens Chocolate Flavor a spin. This powder is marketed as a nutrient-packed dietary supplement featuring 50 organic superfoods, including fruits, vegetables, grasses, mushrooms, and probiotics. Over the past month, I’ve been testing this product regularly, incorporating it into my dietary routine to see if it lives up to the claims of improved energy, gut health, and overall well-being. While I would say I’m satisfied with most aspects of this product, there are some details worth considering before jumping in.

**Packaging and Design**

The first thing that struck me was how compact and travel-friendly the packaging is—probably about the size of a large mug. It’s perfect for someone like me who’s constantly on the go and needs something portable. Even though the container isn’t massive, it’s sturdy, and the twist-off lid seals well, keeping the powder fresh. Inside, there’s a scoop for portioning, though I found it a little on the smaller side and occasionally had to double-check to ensure I was measuring correctly. Minor issue, but definitely not a dealbreaker.

**Ease of Use and Versatility**

Mixing this chocolate-flavored powder into water or milk was surprisingly easy; I didn’t even need a fancy blender—a shaker bottle worked just fine. The result is a smooth, almost creamy consistency without any annoying clumps. I got adventurous and added it to smoothies, pancakes, and even overnight oats. I’ll admit, whoever came up with the chocolate flavor deserves a medal. At no point did I feel like I was forcing myself to drink something “healthy”; instead, it felt like a real treat.

**Highlights**

- Includes 50 organic superfoods for a nutrient-rich diet.  
- Chocolate flavor, which is a game-changer for anyone avoiding typical ""grassy"" flavors.  
- Easy to mix into water, milk, or creative recipes such as smoothies and protein bowls.

**Performance and Benefits**

After about two weeks of consistent use, I started noticing tangible changes. My energy levels improved, not in a jittery way like when you overdose on coffee, but more of a sustained, steady energy throughout the day. This could probably be attributed to the natural ingredients like organic mushrooms (hello, reishi and lion’s mane), which are known for their adaptogenic properties. I also felt less bloated, especially after meals, and I'm fairly certain the probiotics helped with that. 

The fiber content also deserves a shoutout, as it made me feel fuller for longer, reducing those mid-afternoon snack cravings. While I can’t scientifically prove all the benefits it claims—like better immune support—I can say I haven’t felt sluggish or under the weather since adding it to my routine.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- The 20-serving size is small and may not last long for daily users.  
- If you’re not into chocolate, this might not be for you as the flavor is quite pronounced.  
- Scoop size could be updated to make measuring more precise.

**Taste and Texture Experience**

The chocolate flavor here really stands out, and I mean in a good way. It tastes like a slightly earthy chocolate milkshake but without the overwhelming sweetness. I noticed a slight “green” undertone, but if you’re not hyper-sensitive about these undertones, it’s pretty unnoticeable. Texture is smooth, and as mentioned, no gross clumps here. One thing to note: it tastes best when chilled, so don’t skimp on the ice cubes or cold milk.

**Competing Products**

In a market overflowing with greens powders, comparing this to popular alternatives like Organifi Green Juice or Amazing Grass Green Superfood Drink is inevitable. Both competitors offer similar benefits, but what sets COUNTRY FARMS apart is its affordability and, of course, the chocolate flavor. Organifi, for instance, leans more into a citrus-like taste, which not everyone loves, while Amazing Grass is notorious for tasting like, well, grass. Where this product stands out is the creative flavor profile combined with 50 organic ingredients for variety.

On the downside, I find the COUNTRY FARMS serving size smaller than these competing products, so if you’re looking for a longer-lasting option, checking the alternatives might be worth it. But in terms of flavor and convenience, I keep picking this one over the others.

**Worth Every Penny**

Considering the vast list of organic ingredients, including mushrooms, probiotics, and antioxidants, the price seems fair compared to what you'd spend eating all these individually. It’s vegan-friendly, gluten-free, non-GMO, and USDA Organic certified, which checks off a lot of boxes for health-conscious buyers. Seeing how easy it was to maintain my energy and digestive health with it, I’d say it’s definitely much more economical than wasting money on sugary energy drinks or random supplements.

1ksqxd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ksqxd7/i_have_been_cheated_on_i_am_conflicted_if_i/,I have been cheated on. I am conflicted if I should tell the guy's girlfriend that he has been cheating on her as well. What do I do?,"I broke up with my ex since I figured out she was micro-cheating on me with a co-worker. I have warned her multiple times that this guy feels like he likes her, and I feel uncomfortable. There were several advancements to court her, like buying coffee, getting coffee together, asking to call to talk about office drama, and even chatting with each other during our dates. My ex told me these stories when we were talking about breaking up. I didn't catch it at first because this was under an impression of ""friends,"" but the biggest red flag is that both of them are worried that people are talking about how they might have a thing.

We decided to pause the relationship. Neither of us wants to go. I asked her to give the guy boundaries because he is a thorn in the relationship. She suddenly pushed for a break-up. A lot of back and forth, I realize she was fulfilling this romantic need from the co-worker. She let me know that she has settled with me since I don't have this casual, fun, giddy thing that she gets from the co-worker. I pieced it together. Figured out is micro cheating, which is cheating. And left. We talked a week later to tell her everything I am frustrated about. This helps with my healing. It's full on for me now. She told me that she confirmed that the co-worker does like her. She placed a boundary between herself and the co-worker only after we broke up. Also, in respect for the co-worker's current girlfriend. I am not sure if they're respecting that. And I hate to think that I am left here in pieces, and the guy who continuously sabotaged my relationship got away with it. 

I just can't settle with that feeling. I am asking friends. Some people told me if it makes you heal, then yes. Some people told me to choose chaos. Some people told me this is not worth my time anymore. I am hurting. I am conflicted if I want revenge in a way, justice for the girl not knowing, or I just need to behave and let it go.

I have suspected pots (sibling has a diagnosis, i have many symptoms, I'm scheduled for a TTT but probably can't afford it bc they estimated $3500 for it) - anyway had a weird episode yesterday and have been trying to figure out what the cause might have been so I wanted to ask here to see if this sounds familiar at all.

yesterday I got 8 hours of sleep (great for me) but when I woke up it was extremely difficult to get out of bed. I made it to work and was seriously, legitimately struggling to keep my eyes open in way that does not happen for me. I felt dizzy every time my eyes closed. I could barely hold my head up. I spent about three hours drinking three cups of coffee but it didn't help. Coffee usually works for me. I felt really weak and struggled to move my limbs. I couldn't open my granola bar because my grip strength was so bad. I had major major brain fog and was struggling with things like remembering whether September or January comes first during the year. My fingers and feet kept falling asleep. When I finally asked my manager if it was okay if I went home early, I struggled to string a sentence together or say anything coherent. On the drive home, I actually felt like I might pass out (I've never passed out before). I took iron and B vitamin (i couldn't afford labs but the doctor said I was ok to take iron since I've had iron deficiency anemia before, as a child) and hydrated when I got home and just laid on the couch. I took a covid/flu test, which was negative. I finally started to feel a bit better about 7 hours later. I feel about 5000% better the day after.

 other potential theories about causes: 

- my fitbit claims that my oxygen saturation the night before was 92%, which is low for me. I checked during the day and it was 98% 

- on Monday, I went on a half hour walk where my heart rate hit 178 (usually it only goes from 60-75 sitting up to 130-140 at most while walking, and I walk ~20 minutes almost every day and have for months). I felt exhausted on Tuesday and these symptoms happened on Wednesday. could I have triggered a flareup or something? 

I feel stupid typing these out when it sounds like I was just tired yesterday but it was Not a normal tired experience and was scary. I've had minor pots symptoms for ages but recently had covid and my symptoms got significantly worse, which is why I started seeking a diagnosis, and why I'm experiencing brand new symptoms now. thank you for any thoughts you might have ",2,1747920983.0,POTS,7,1.0,False

I understand flavor degrades with coffee after the beans are ground--so ideally you want to ground same day, but if you're getting pre-ground beans or grounding them in a store when you buy them, buying a lot is like paying for a quarter bag of bliss followed by 3 quarters of regrets.

But Keurig cups, by sealing in everything from air until the moment its used, circumvents this issue.  In my opinion--it's the only practical way to do flavored coffee unless you deliberately ground only enough beans for that one pot.",0,1747920665.0,unpopularopinion,14,0.18,False
1ksqrg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1ksqrg7/elvanse_and_ocd/,Elvanse and OCD?,"So just for a bit of a backstory - I’m a 32 year old female (almost 33🥲) and I started Elvanse 3 months ago after being diagnosed with combined ADHD, did the whole titration period etc, I’ve now settled on 50mg which is great for me and it’s honestly been life changing. I initially got assessed as eventually the ADHD was having a real negative impact on my life - relationships, work etc. I had no motivation I weren’t looking after myself/hygiene etc and I just felt like I had no purpose being here. 

Anyway - I’ve found that with the Elvanse I seem to have developed a serious case of OCD. I’ve always been clean and tidy but only slightly more than the normal person. I never lie in bed anymore or get back into bed once I’m up, which is great, but I’m not sleeping until late at night either because I’m obsessing over little things that I need to do. 
For example I was really tired a few nights ago so I told myself I’d have an early night and I was in bed for 9pm… tell me why I was up until 5am sorting out my cupboards and throwing away all the crap I’ve accumulated over the years… I honestly COULD NOT stop myself and I couldn’t of gone to sleep knowing I hadn’t finished it. This is happening more often now and I’m up at 7am for the school run and like I said I never take naps in the day anymore like I used to so I think I’m exhausted and I’m scared that I’m going to reach burn out. 
Also if I do sit down and try and watch TV I’m looking round the room for something to do or lining everything up on the coffee table in front of me until everything is neat and in order. Which is amazing to me because before I was medicated my biggest flaw was my organisation skills! They were absolutely shocking!
I also feel like I keep stuttering my words or I can’t get them out of my mouth quick enough, I’ve always spoke fast but I feel like I’m worse now. I do wonder if it’s a case of being TOO hyper focused? It’s like if I go on my phone I will be on it for hours and not notice, or if I start tidying the house I will be so zoned in on that that I can’t stop until everything is done 😬

My question is - has anyone else experienced this? Is my dose too high and am I just completely wired all of the time? 🤣 I really hope not because the meds have worked wonders for me and they’re perfect in every other way, these are just things I’ve noticed that maybe shouldn’t be happening? 
If they’re too strong for me what am I meant to do? I had 60mg and they made me feel awful, and 40mg didn’t feel like they did a thing to me and I was crashing at 3/4pm and couldn’t keep my eyes open. I really thought I’d cracked it with the 50mg and found my sweet spot so I’ll be gutted if not. 

I’m also thinking of having weekends off the medication, just so I can get some rest.. does anyone else have breaks?

I’m so tired, I’m running on minimal sleep and my back hurts 🤣! I need to relax and let my body rest but I don’t know how to, please helppppp🫶🏽

Towards the end I was 10lbs from my goal weight. We had to move suddenly for my husband's career and over the last 8 years, I gained back all of it plus. The area we moved to was not welcoming at all, if you weren't born there, they wanted nothing to do with you. That and other factors triggered my depression and anxiety, I now have crippling social anxiety, which I soothed with food. My marriage has been affected by this and I have concerns about the future relationship with my kids if I don't return to a healthy lifestyle. We moved again this year for my husband's career and the new area has been lovely. Lots of socializing, friendly folks everywhere, just an overall better fit for our family.

Our kids are traveling to stay with grandparents this summer and my husband and I booked a romantic vacation to reconnect. We've gone all out, 1st class flights, resort on the beach, private transportation to and from the airport, the works (I'm very excited about this, and am sorry if it comes off braggy). Of course I feel like everyone is going to be staring at me, so about 2-3 weeks ago I brought up keto to my husband and he's all in. It's been going great, I'm down 13lbs and 1.5-2 inches in my waist. The trip has been a great motivator and I have no plan to stop after we return.

Unfortunately, my husband, 42M, isn't having the same experience.  He said he's actually gained 2lbs. He's eating what I pack for his lunches and what we have for dinner and some keto snacks (string cheese, pecans, boiled eggs, etc). He did say that he grabs scrambled eggs and bacon from the cafeteria at his office in the mornings, but otherwise he's just eating my cooking. He drinks water constantly, but he does have coffee in the morning with a keto creamer, as well as a mushroom drink with 0 carb creatine monohydrate and 1gm carb mushroom powder that he mixes in either water or a 0 sugar drink mix. He has bowel issues and swears this concoction helps him poop better and has helped with shoulder pain from a motorcycle crash way back in his racing days. After dinner, he'll have a keto treat. His job is 100% sedentary and extremely high stress. He works in nuclear power emergency issue resolutions. The one we can do nothing about his stress at work, but does anyone see anything else that could be causing him to struggle with this? He did throw in yesterday that he didn't weigh himself the first week, so maybe he is losing and was heavier than he thought, but he also said he's seeing no change in his clothing fit or energy levels.

Hi, my name is Sofia, I'm 21, and my boyfriend Keir is 23. I work at a local coffee shop here in Florida, and my boyfriend works as a bartender 41 minutes away. We lived together in our small apartment, and we don’t have any kids.

One night, as we were both getting ready for bed, I noticed him smiling at his phone. When I asked why he was smiling like that, he told me he was just reading a funny meme on Instagram, so I shrugged it off.

I woke up in the middle of the night all alone in bed. I slowly got up and found him in the kitchen, talking to someone. That’s when I heard it—he was sweet-talking someone. Before he hung up, he said, “Alright baby, see you on Saturday. I love you.” That’s when I lost it. I walked up to him and confronted him, asking who he was talking to. He said, “Babe, I can explain.”

Tears dropped down my face as I cried in front of him. I told him I needed a break. He respected my decision and left our apartment that very night. I cried the entire night. Early in the morning, I called our manager and told them I couldn’t make it to work because I had a really bad fever and needed to rest.

After that, I called my best friend and told her to come over because I needed her at that moment. Minutes later, she arrived at our apartment. I told her everything. She gave me advice and comforted me—she really helped me a lot during that time.

Almost a month later, Keir came back to our apartment with chocolates and flowers, begging for forgiveness. He said we should get back together. I still loved him, and he seemed sincere, so I forgave him.

We were okay for a while, but not long after—just two months later—I caught him again. This time, I snatched his phone, and when I looked at the name, that’s when I saw it—it was my best friend all along. My heart shattered. I felt betrayed for the second time—not only by my boyfriend but also by my best friend. After that, I cut them both off.

It’s been really hard for me. It still hurts when I think about it. My best friend since high school betrayed me. I trusted her. Now, I’m still not fully healed.

Do you guys have any tips on what I should do?

Many Ukrainian families living outside Ukraine have soldiers inside Ukraine, still fighting. Those families often contact UFL on the soldier's behalf and very often give UFL small ""thank you"" gifts or items that can be used in fundraising.

This week we have a collection of just such items:

* A copy of the book [The All Clear](https://booklion.lviv.ua/en/vidbii-povitrianoi-tryvohy), an art journal of the first six months of the full-scale war in both Ukrainian and English
* A wooden plaque version of the [Brave Ukrainian Farmers stamp](https://uapostcards.org/product/brave-ukrainian-farmers/)
* A coffee mug
* A ""Military Edition"" can of the ubiquitous Non Stop energy drink

# The $5 SBU drone collection

In thanks for the powerbanks, the SBU unit who thanked you for the Ecoflows sent us their flag and unit patch. 

Additionally, in recognition of the importance drones have in this war, we have a Ukrainian [Army of Drones](https://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/united24/) challenge coin and two more drone patches to round out this big pack.

What surprised me most is just how much care and tradition goes into it.

**Organic Darjeeling tea** is usually grown in small estates high up in the Himalayan foothills. The climate and soil there give it this floral, fresh aroma that’s hard to describe unless you’ve tried it. Unlike mass-produced tea, the leaves are hand-plucked — usually just the top two leaves and a bud — and processed in small batches to preserve their natural flavor.

What I find even more interesting is that organic estates tend to focus on sustainable practices — using compost instead of chemical fertilizers, avoiding pesticides, and supporting the local communities through fair wages and better working conditions.

It got me thinking — how much do we really know about where our tea (or even coffee) comes from?

We grew very close very quickly, doing trips together and spending most days together. Gift giving was a big part of the friendship, whether it be a cute mug we saw or just a coffee run/ breakfast.

Last year Dani got a boyfriend and he became her top priority, though she constantly preached about being a good friend and not abandoning me after getting a partner. I said nothing as she seemed happy, but I noticed the distance. When they broke up, she said she would happily give everything she had up to get him back and that nothing in her life was worth as much as him (ouch).

Things got a little better after that, but she became really strange. She’s only interested in her job, her hair, ect, and will rarely about anything else.

Cut to this year, she gets a girlfriend and adores her. Things are getting a bit better. We aren’t hanging out as much but when we do there’s a little more to talk about. She’s getting GF expensive jellycats and taking her on nights out/ weekends away.

As my birthday was coming up, she was talking loads about what she was getting me. Vinyls were brought up, coins (I collect them), things like that. About two weeks from my birthday she started asking what I wanted and I gave her loads of suggestions (vinyls, books, anything to do with my fixations which she knows about.)

Anyway on the day she got me a pair of socks and two boxes of tea (herbal and jasmine). I feel like a massive dick because I just thought wtf? I only drink black and fruit tea, and have loads. Also socks? I feel like I’m acting spoiled because I expected her to think a little about me, but she just said she couldn’t afford anything because she’s saving for a trip. A week later she takes GF out to the most expensive local restaurant.

1ksqff2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ksqff2/boyfriends_son_and_girlfriend_keep_leaving_mess/,Boyfriends son and girlfriend keep leaving mess!!,"Hi, 

So I live with my boyfriend I’m currently about 17 weeks pregnant. 

He has an older son in his 20’s who also lives here. His son is generally a lovely guy. And his son’s girlfriend is also pregnant. His son has a room here and pays rent and all that, but he and his gf can be here for weeks but then also gone for weeks when they’re at his gf’s parents house. 

When they are here…they literally make such a mess. They just leave stuff out, they leave and horde dishes. 

I walked past his son’s room at one point and there was a stack of about 4 days worth of dishes in his room.

They then just leave dishes in the kitchen and they just sit there. 

I tried to wait them out and waited 2 days with a sink and kitchen worktops overflowing with dishes and they didn’t even attempt them. What made me doubly angry was that yesterday afternoon they came out to make lunch and his son said to his gf 

“Here’s the deal, I’ll do the dishes if you make lunch” 

His girlfriend did protest to this but I figured this sounded like it would be what they would do. 

I speedily made my way out the kitchen thinking, this is great! And went and had a nap, only to return to the dishes having not been done and more been made from them evidently having lunch. 

Today I spent a little over 2 hours cleaning and whilst doing the dishes was interrupted by his son wanting to get into the sink for water for tea and coffee so they could make more dishes!!! 

I’m absolutely at my wits end. But I can’t relax at all in a messy space and I can’t/won’t cook when there’s already piles of dishes and so I feel forced into doing them because it seems apparent that no one else will and clearly no one else is as disturbed as me by this. 

They’ve got 3 Ethernet cables running through the house on the floor that I’ve nearly tripped on more times than I can count. 

They have taken/used my food in the fridge without asking or even seeming to question weather this might be mine or not. Yet when I used his sons girlfriends cup it was swiftly taken back from me and I felt like I’d used something I clearly wasn’t supposed to. 

I don’t want to make things difficult or cause issues and my anxiety is in part that I think my boyfriend likes having his son here and if I raise this the likeihood is that his son will just spent more time at his gf’s parents. 

I just feel like this stuff is common courtesy and I don’t get how they don’t get that. I would be embarrassed to leave things like that and watch someone else do my dishes for me.

1ksq43e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1ksq43e/faith_in_the_storm_dealing_with_crisis_in_business/,Faith in the Storm: Dealing with Crisis in Business,"Not too long ago, I found myself in one of those nail-biting situations that felt right out of a Hollywood disaster movie—only the only thing on the line wasn’t some mythical artifact, but my small business. Picture this: it was a Monday morning, the sun was shining, birds were singing—everything seemed perfect. I was feeling particularly optimistic, maybe a little too optimistic. Then came the email that felt like a punch to the gut, reminding me that optimism doesn’t always pay the bills.

In a nutshell, a crucial supplier had unexpectedly decided to halt operations. Just like that, one of our key products was suddenly off the table. Panic set in. I could feel the sweat forming on my brow as my mind raced through the whirlwind of potential consequences. Would we have to downsize? Could I let my team down? I wanted to pull my hair out, but frankly, there just wasn’t much left to go around.

So, I did what I often do in moments of crisis; I turned to faith. I sat down in my cluttered office, surrounded by stacks of paperwork and the comforting smell of old coffee, and I took a deep breath. I remembered Philippians 4:6-7: “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.” It was like a reminder from a dear friend that it was okay to feel overwhelmed, but also okay to reach out for support.

I started praying—not the fancy, eloquent kind of prayer, but the raw, honest kind where I laid everything bare. “Lord, I’m in deep here. I need your guidance. Please help me come up with a plan.” Then, it hit me. In that very moment of surrender, I felt a spark of creativity flicker in my mind. Why not reach out directly to our customers and let them know what we were facing? I figured, if I was scared, surely they’d understand. After all, we were in this together.

I drafted an email, filled with my usual mix of vulnerability and humor, and hit send. You know, the kind of email where you tell people your dog ate your business plan and you just need a miracle? I hit “send” and at that moment, it felt like a giant weight had lifted.

To my surprise, the responses that rolled in were nothing short of incredible. Customers weren’t just sympathetic; they rallied around us. Some offered to pre-order new products, others sent words of encouragement that brought tears to my eyes. It was like I had tapped into a well of community support that I didn’t even realize existed. Their faith in us renewed my own faith.

As we navigated through this business crisis, I learned something profound: faith isn’t just about hanging on when things get tough, it’s also about inviting others into the mess. It’s about vulnerability and sharing the load. By saying “yes” to the situation and laying out my fears, I found strength and solutions I couldn’t see before. There’s a sacred beauty in community that can transform a crisis into a catalyst for something greater.

So, in the end, we didn’t just survive that tempest—oh no, my friends—we thrived. Our connections deepened, my understanding of leadership evolved, and my faith? Well, it transformed into a beacon that illuminated the path forward. It reminded me that, no matter how stormy the seas may get, I’m not sailing alone. And isn’t that the true richness of faith?",1,1747918895.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

“Just closed on a lake house. So blessed.”

“Front row seats to the concert. #Blessed”

“My latte art came out perfect today. Feeling blessed!”

At this point, the word “blessed” might need a support group.

In the biblical imagination, being “blessed” usually looks like wandering the wilderness, being poor in spirit, mourning, being persecuted, or carrying a cross, not necessarily sipping a macchiato with flawless foam.

Don’t get me wrong, lake houses and latte art are lovely. But when Jesus opened his Sermon on the Mount, he didn’t say, “Blessed are the homeowners,” or “Blessed are the well-caffeinated.” He said:
“Blessed are the meek.”
“Blessed are those who mourn.”
“Blessed are the peacemakers.”

It’s almost as if blessing has less to do with lifestyle upgrades and more to do with the strange peace that sneaks in when everything else falls apart.

So maybe let’s be careful not to shrink the word. “Blessed” isn’t just a humblebrag in disguise. It’s a deep, defiant joy that sometimes shows up not in having more, but in losing well, loving hard, and finding God in the cracks.

Just a thought from someone still grateful for his coffee but trying to remember what blessing really means.",3,1747918895.0,Christianmarriage,3,0.67,False

Step back to 1912 Michigan! Our new 3-minute mini-documentary takes you to historic Capac Michigan – from the grand Palmer House hotel to a steam train’s arrival at the Capac depot, and even a dramatic run on the village bank on June 17, 1912. See busy cattle pens, the chicory mill, and Main Street shops come alive. Packed with names, dates and vintage photos, it’s perfect nostalgia for history buffs 55+ in Michigan.\
\
\
\
Railroad and Hospitality of Capac Michigan\
\
\
\
At dawn in 1912, the little village of Capac, Michigan, stirred awake to the whistle of the Grand Trunk steam engine. The railroad had arrived in 1866, placing Capac on the busy main line between Port Huron and Flint. The arriving “Flyer” passenger train was a daily spectacle, its black locomotive roaring into the depot as locals gathered on the platform. \
\
\
\
Across Main Street from the depot stood the stately Palmer House hotel – a new 3-story brick building by 1912 – welcoming travelers and businessmen. On early postcards one can see horse-drawn wagons parked outside, travelers lingering on the porch, and the rustic boardwalks lining the street. This junction of tracks and tavern meant capac’s life circled around trains and travelers.\
\
Bank Crisis of 1912\
\
Capac Bank Failure 1912\
\
For most days, Capac’s State Savings Bank (founded in 1898) quietly handled deposits and loans for farmers and shopkeepers. But on Monday, June 17, 1912, that calm was shattered. Word spread that the small town bank might fail, and by afternoon nearly 150 people jammed its entrance. We have a vivid image from that day: a massive crowd outside the bank. The bank was indeed located next to the Hotel DeBurt on Main Street, and people hurried there from neighboring farms and homes. Though no detailed newspaper account survives, the photo and anecdotes suggest a classic “run on the bank,” as frightened depositors demanded cash. The scene of anxious mothers, businessmen in coats, and children peering out windows captures the tension – a moment when community trust was put to the test.\
\
Farms and Manufacturing\
\
\
\
Beyond the village streets, Capac’s economy thrived on agriculture and small industry. Cattle and hogs were herded into fenced stockyards by the tracks, then loaded onto rail cars bound for city slaughterhouses. Every morning farm wagons creaked in under the weight of produce, the smell of hay and livestock in the air. \
\
\
\
One specialty crop was chicory, a coffee substitute: a 1911 postcard reveals the Vanneste Brothers’ chicory mill operating in town. Workers roasted and bagged chicory root in wooden vats, ready for market. Peat moss was another local resource. \
\
\
\
In 1903 the American Peat Fuel Company set up near Capac to harvest bog peat for fuel and paper-making. By 1908 this plant became the Pilgrim Paper Company, using peat to manufacture paper. In fact, postcards also advertise the Capac Paper Mill (sometimes called the Capac Paper Company) in town. These mills and factories – modest smoke-stacks dotting the skyline – provided jobs and diversified the economy beyond farming.\
\
Main Street and Motor Age\
\
\
\
Along Main Street, commerce bustled between the railroad and depot. Wood-frame and brick storefronts sat shoulder-to-shoulder: a hardware store, a grocer, a blacksmith, all lit by gas lamps at night. \
\
\
\
Prominent among them was Lang Brothers Buggies & Farm Implements, a shop where farmers bought wagons and tools. (Early autos were just beginning to appear on the dirt roads.) \
\
\
\
By the late 1920s, even gasoline was sold here: one period postcard shows J.W. White Mutual Oil Co., a local Shell gasoline station. Attendants in shirtsleeves pumped fuel into Model Ts as the era of the automobile dawned. Through all these scenes – the depot master waving flags, the hotel clerk polishing glasses, the banker counting out bills – one feels the rhythms of a railroad village. The grand trees and simple wood sidewalks, the clatter of hooves on Main, and the billowing train smoke create a living portrait of small-town life.",1,1747918578.0,thumbwind,0,1.0,False

Anyone interested?,"Trying to find a new group of friends nearby to try new things and get more steps in now that the weather is nicer. Id like to have everyone close by (say Scarborough ish) because I really want to just have inpromptu hangouts. It feels like almost a sitcom fantasy in the modern day, but my friends downtown are all close to each other and manage to do it so why can't we have that? 

If you want to know more about me, I recently reignited my love for reading. I used to write stories too a long time ago and I've flirted with getting back into it. I love anything horror and play very casual videogames like stardew, Minecraft, etc... I have been getting back into the ukulele, and am a big huge nerd - think marvel, Harry potter, avatar, and I'd love to hear about your nerdy passions as well :) 

No restriction on activities or things we could try but below are some I'd be into:

- board games
- visiting cafes, bars, and restaurants
- coffee walks

I want to kind of understand, if you have a non- women obsessed partner, who is not a p\*rn watcher and isn't just creepy overall, like he is not purposely or constantly looking at women (instagram feed, stalking online), where did you find him? Just least bothered that other women exist and focused on growing in their life, becoming better themselves?  
  
Also if you know guys who are like this, where did you find them? I have met a lot of  wonder what kind of jobs these men might be doing? eg. maybe a finance guy, usually very disciplined, maybe a boxer? idk.

I know this might come off weird to some people but it's a preference for sure and I just want to understand if there is any hope in the world for this particular preference.

     I hope I haven't kept you waiting too long. I was such a mess. This morning I woke up and gave into frustration. I thought I was running late, I was cold, and I have a headache. 

My cat, sensing my frustration, aggressively groomed my shaved head as if to say: ""I love you. Get going."" So I got up, put on a cozy hoodie, fed the cats, and checked my schedule. No one till 9! Hallelujah. I grabbed my new ST vinyl sticker for my car, applied it, grabbed coffee and hit the road.

Especially interesting to me to have noticed the 316 as last night I was going over some DM's here on reddit (since direct messaging is going away.) I was reading a message chain where another user and I were discussing what a relationship with God looks like, how to arrive at that sense of peace and stillness, how to come home to yourself. I was thinking about how kind it was of them to take that time to reach out to me. 

I could just be crazy. It doesn't really matter. I am so loved, and so are you- always. We are never alone. Time to go spread some light.

1ksps36,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1ksps36/my_bf_thinks_its_normal_to_look_at_other_women/,My bf thinks its normal to look at other women when out with me,"My boyfriend (50) looks at other women when we are out. Would it be an overreaction for me (32)  to break up with him? We’ve been together for four years, and I want to say, objectively, he is a lovely man.

I sort of blame myself for staying with him. He’s very classically handsome, but also very insecure—especially now that he’s older. When I first met him, I could tell he initially just wanted to sleep with me. After our first meeting, I changed my number and didn’t contact him.

I met him again by chance a few months later. He was apologetic and seemed nicer—not so much like someone who was just going to use me for sex.

We went on dates and it was good, but early on, I would catch him staring at other women. I told him how my ex destroyed my confidence doing that, and then gaslit me by saying, “I’m just looking around.” To his credit, my boyfriend stopped looking so obviously in front of me. 

When we spoke about his past relationships, I realised he was kind of shallow. He dated models and seemed obsessed with how women looked (and how he looked too). It was like the attention he got from attractive women validated him. I have noticed that he doesn’t date age-appropriate or average-looking women.  

When we met, his Instagram was just full of women. He never added me on social media, and to this day, still hasn’t. His Instagram Explore page....just women.

About seven months into our relationship, I looked through his phone. I went through his Instagram DMs—just all sorts of messages to attractive women, “reaching out.” Nothing I could explicitly call cheating.

He has a thing for mixed-race women (Black and white). He’s white, I’m Black. At the beginning, he kept asking me to “make my hair curly,” and I had to explain that it’s a hair type—not something I can just do. Now, every time he sees an attractive mixed-race woman on TV, he follows her on Instagram or says I should meet her—I, who has never expressed an interest in meeting these women.

Guess what’s on my Instagram Explore feed? Clothes. Embroidery. Art. Guess who I follow? Only women.

But then I went through his iMessages with his ex and found out he had been meeting her for coffee well into the start of our relationship. In fact, she stopped talking to him. 
This ex is “the one who got away.” She’s a former model who works in the same industry he’s pursuing. She’s a decade or so older than me.

I didn’t get mad. I just said nothing. I felt numb. I’m insecure about how I look, so to me, it confirmed I’m not good enough for a man to be fully obsessed with. But the resentment has been building ever since. I don’t think I’ve taken him seriously since then.

I’ve gone out and had flirtations with other men—not cheating, but using it to confirm I’m attractive. Other men must find me attractive. I always tell my boyfriend about it, but honestly, I don’t think it registers. To him, it’s probably just an ego boost: other men want my girlfriend. But in reality, it’s me emotionally distancing myself—reassuring myself that if I leave, I can still get attention.

Do you want to know why he and the ex broke up? She caught him talking to other women on Facebook. She was everything he wanted and he couldn't stop reaching out to other women. 

He doesn’t let me touch his phone and gets weird if I need to use it. But this started before I ever looked through it. He always puts it face-down when I’m near, and he turns it on airplane mode at night. He says he’s “just always done this.”

This was all brought up because earlier this week we were in a coffee shop and he glanced at a pretty girl.

It may have just been a glance, but I spiralled. He likes to go to coffee shops alone a lot. So if I wasn’t there, would it still be “just a glance”? In that moment, I felt so ugly. So broken. So ashamed.

When I go out dressed up, I get a lot of attention. I’m tall, skinny, big boobs—not so pretty, though. I’ve noticed older women or women in relationships give me funny looks or act a bit rude, calling me a tart, etc. I’ve seen their husbands watching me.

Now I understand those women. I know exactly what they feel. The misplaced hatred at me for being “the temptation,” instead of being angry at their partners for giving me attention. And now… I’m them. I find myself hating women prettier than me because I know my partner would be looking—or trying not to look—at them.

I feel ashamed. Those women never did anything to me. It’s these stupid men.

I spoke to him about it, and he said it’s normal for men to look. But then I showed him a video of a man saying he “retains a sexual appetite for his wife because he doesn’t go out looking at other women or follow loads of women on social media.” He said he doesn’t give himself anything to compare her to.

A woman in the video added that we know the impact social media has on girls—how they’re all getting surgery now to look like Instagram models. So why don’t men realise the impact it has on them too? How it damages their view of women, relationships, and what’s “normal.”


He’s very nice outside of this, but I don’t know if I’m overreacting. He hasn’t cheated—that I know of.

But his habits paint a picture: a man who craves external validation, who is shallow and looks-obsessed, who keeps a literal menu of women to message, even though I call him handsome every day.

I love him. But is this all I get in exchange for my love and devotion? Is this all women can expect?

We’re told to love men unconditionally. Forgive them. Do everything for them—cook, clean, work, stay fit—and all we get in return is a man who thinks it’s normal to look at other women while he’s with the one he claims to love.

That’s all I get?

I think I’d rather be single for the rest of my life.

Now to be clear — we’re not dating or anything. We hang out a lot, study together, and grab coffee sometimes, but it’s all platonic (at least for now). Still, I don’t want to get her something too basic or impersonal, but also not overly romantic to give the wrong idea.

She’s into books, photography, iced coffee (no matter how cold it is), and she has a cat she treats like royalty. I’ve been debating between a cute cat-themed gift, something artsy, or even just a nice journal with a personal note.

He used to be super skittish when I adopted him in Feb 2024 — hiding in the litter box, hissing, only coming out to eat at night. Over time, he became the cuddliest, clingiest little guy. He sleeps between my legs, sprawls on my chest purring, follows me around, and always demands attention and pets.

Yesterday afternoon was a normal day. I left my bedroom door ajar so he could roam. He came in while I was watching a movie in bed — he couldn’t see me due to a blanket, and as I got down from the bed (he was underneath it), I accidentally scared him. He bolted, meowed loudly (a sound I’d never heard from him before), and hid under the coffee table looking terrified — puffed-up tail, low head, alert ears.

I tried comforting him with treats (he loves food), but he refused them and stayed frozen. My roommate (who has lots of cat experience) came to help. He let her pet him after a few minutes and eventually ate treats from her, but avoided me. When I moved, he hid again.

He wouldn’t come near me for nearly an hour. Even as I stood talking with my roommate, he stared at me from afar with low posture and alert ears. My roommate offered her room as a safe space — Ghost immediately ran under her bed and stayed there for 5 hours. Later, he let me pet him again, but still wasn’t rubbing on me or acting like his usual self.

At dinnertime, he didn’t run up like normal. My roommate had to coax him out and bring him to my room, where he ate — but he was very quiet and slow the rest of the night. No meowing, no zoomies, no purring. He eventually hopped up on my desk (where he normally begs for pets) and rubbed his head on mine, so I took that as a small sign of progress.

But when I woke up at 3 a.m., he was sleeping in his litter box — something he only did when I first adopted him, or when I was gone and there was a thunderstorm. I coaxed him out with treats and he purred and let me cuddle him, but refused to leave the bathroom or my closet (where I don’t usually let him stay because he rips open his treat bags) When I tried to get him out, he ran back to the bathroom.

My partner (who has had several cats) suggested I move the litter box into my room (without the lid), close the bathroom, and let him be. Since then, he’s been hiding under my desk where I put a blanket — but he still won’t get on the bed or relax like he used to.

What can I do to help him feel safe and comfortable in my room again, especially on the bed? I feel awful for scaring him and I just want him to feel safe and happy again.",1,1747917781.0,CatAdvice,2,1.0,False

But he mentioned how he met a girl from the coffee shop that he thought was cute and it took everything for him not to make a move on her. 

He also talked about an online relationship he had with someone . 

I was shocked at the amount of detail he was getting to an online presence. I'm a pretty private person. I barely use Instagram and never post personal life stories or updates

Chapter 1

Fr. Logan, the Monsignor at Mary Help of Christians Church on 12th Street in the East Village, was no ordinary priest. He was a mystic — gifted with the rare ability to communicate with angels and spirits. They knew it too, which is why several Guardian Angels approached him with a troubling dilemma.

Mateo, Romeo, Lucas, and Ava — all Guardians — reported a strange encounter. A portion of their energy had been drained after their human charges came into brief contact with a mysterious man outside morning Mass. The man had greeted each person cheerfully, gave them a light pat on the back or shoulder, and introduced himself as Giacomo.

The moment the contact was made, the angels felt it — a pull, like something siphoning power straight from them. They watched in alarm as Giacomo’s backpack glowed faintly with each interaction, as though it were absorbing the energy and storing it. For what purpose, they didn’t know. He didn’t appear to be an angel or a spirit. From what they could tell, he was human — but one with unnatural abilities.

The Monsignor was troubled. He consulted with members of his congregation, asking if anyone had heard of such a person or had any knowledge of this type of phenomenon. Several parishioners brought up the same name: Julius Q. Bygone.

A neighborhood fixture, Julius was known to possess gifts of his own — mental telepathy, communion with spirits, the ability to wrestle ghosts and walk through dreams. A supernatural sleuth, if there ever was one.

It sounded like exactly the kind of man Monsignor Logan needed.

Julius lived nearby, in a modest studio on East 14th Street. He had a reputation for being eccentric — but in a good way. He had an odd obsession with the color brown: brown suit, brown socks, brown shoes. Always topped off with a fedora, complete with a red feather in the band. He also happened to be a die-hard Grateful Dead fan — though he preferred his tie-dye only if it came in shades of brown (a fact that amused no one more than himself).

The Monsignor found an old copy of The Village Voice, flipping to an ad that read:

JULIUS Q. BYGONE
Supernatural Sleuth of Shadows
Experienced in paranormal phenomena & mystery solving
— Phone number listed below —

Logan called the number. When Julius answered, the Monsignor felt a faint vibration through the phone — subtle, but unmistakable.

He explained the situation briefly. Julius listened, intrigued.

They set the meeting for that afternoon. 2 p.m. At the church.

Chapter 2

Julius Q. Bygone strode into Monsignor Logan’s office like an actor making his entrance onstage. That was just his style.

Monsignor filled him in on the dilemma facing the four guardian angels. Julius listened closely, then asked, “Did they experience any adverse effects from the power drain?”

“No,” the Monsignor replied. “Within a day or two, they recovered completely. They never felt it was enough to put their humans in any real danger.”

“Well, that’s a good sign. Hopefully this Giacomo doesn’t have bad intentions. But we can’t take anything for granted at this point,” Julius said.

“He’s only approached parishioners leaving morning Mass,” Monsignor added. “With your extrasensory perception, you should be able to stake it out tomorrow and, hopefully, pick up his vibe.”

Julius banged his open hand on the desk.
“Outstanding plan!” he shouted, clearly excited by the prospect of meeting the mysterious Giacomo. As he turned to leave, he added with a half-smile, “I’m not an overly pious man, Monsignor, but I’m looking forward to Mass tomorrow.”

⸻

The next morning, Julius took a seat in the last pew near the center aisle, where the parishioners typically exited.

He wasn’t a regular churchgoer, but he followed along—standing, kneeling, and sitting when the others did.

Monsignor delivered an especially moving homily about loving your neighbor—especially your enemies. A subtle message, Julius suspected, meant for Giacomo, in case he was in the congregation.

When Mass ended, the crowd filed out slowly. A few lingered behind to light candles or pray silently.

Then Julius felt it—a faint buzzing in his chest. His senses perked. The buzz grew stronger as he wandered the church, scanning quietly, drawn forward like a divining rod to water.

And there he was.

A man stood at the front of the church, his hand gently resting on the shoulder of an elderly woman who was kneeling in front of a statue of the Blessed Mother.

Julius noticed it immediately—a subtle glow pulsing from the man’s backpack. A sure sign: a small portion of the woman’s guardian angel’s power was being siphoned away.

Julius believed in being direct. He was also an experienced ghost wrestler. If Giacomo bolted, Julius had no doubt he could subdue him.

But before he could act, Giacomo turned and spotted him. His expression wasn’t guilty or frightened—just a bit bewildered. Then, to Julius’s surprise, he began walking toward him.

“Mr. Bygone,” Giacomo said warmly, extending a hand. “What a coincidence. I was planning to call you when I got home—I saw your ad on Craigslist. You sound like just the man I need.”

Julius shook his hand emphatically, though with a hint of caution. Julius was a man of extremes.

“I’ve got a long story to tell,” Giacomo continued. “A long, interesting story—and I’m quite sure that once you hear it, you’ll be able to help me.”

“My apartment’s about ten blocks from here,” Julius said, straightening his brown tie. “That’s where I conduct all my business. Why don’t we walk over there, and you can tell me your story over a fresh pot of coffee?”

Chapter 3 

Giacomo sat at Julius’s table. Julius placed two coffee mugs down, then reached for the ever-present pot perched on the eternal flame. In Julius Q. Bygone’s apartment, the coffee was always hot, always ready—black as ink and strong enough to raise the dead.

The apartment was a minimalist’s fever dream. A square, bare studio on East 14th Street: a table, a fridge, a couch that doubled as a bed, a dresser, and a large mirror nailed to the wall. Every item was brown. Brown table, brown couch, brown walls, brown fridge. Even the coffee mugs were brown. Julius loved brown like most men loved air or music.

“Milk? Sugar?” Julius offered.

“No thanks,” Giacomo said, gripping the mug. “I take it black.”

“Same here.” Julius nodded with approval. “All right. Let’s start brainstorming your problem.”

Giacomo took a breath, then began.

“It starts in Catania, Sicily. My grandfather Octavio lived at the base of a volcano. A real one. Mount Etna. He built a glass house down there—don’t ask how it didn’t melt or explode. That’s part of the legend. He was born with a tail nub at the base of his spine. Not long, just a bump. But it gave him strength—real strength, supernatural strength.”

Julius leaned in, mug steaming between his hands.

“Living nearby, in the surrounding forest, was a tribe of werewolves. Not the fairy tale kind. These were wild things. They’d raid the villages—steal livestock, break into homes, carry off food and valuables. They left fear in their wake.

“But one day they made a fatal mistake. They tried to raid Octavio’s house.

“They didn’t know what they were dealing with. Octavio wasn’t just strong—he was a fighter. Hand-to-hand, blades, anything. Rumor was he’d been a mercenary in his youth, but he never talked about it.

“His weapon was an axe—an old thing, the blade forged from silver. That blade could tear through werewolf hide like a carving knife through lamb. But the real trick? When he held it at a certain angle, it vibrated. Let out this hum—like a singing bowl crossed with thunder. The sound created a force field. Invisible, but solid. No werewolf could cross it.”

Julius’s eyes narrowed in fascination. “He killed them?”

“A few, yeah. The rest fled back into the forest. Octavio stood his ground and told them, ‘Come back, and I’ll finish the job.’ So they stayed away—ate raccoon and possum to survive. They hated him. But they feared him more.”

Giacomo’s voice dropped to a whisper.

“They cursed him. Or rather, they cursed his youngest grandson—me. Every weekend, when I sleep, they come for me in my dreams. They hunt me, tear at me, beat me bloody. I wake up on Monday drained and trembling. Too weak to live. I just hide until Friday… and then it starts again.”

He paused, wiping sweat from his brow.

“I’ve tried everything, Julius. Therapists. Meds. Spiritualists. Nothing works. But I have a theory. If I can reach my grandfather in the afterlife—if I can find him—I believe he can give me the axe. And with it, I can fight the werewolves in my dreams. End the curse.”

Julius raised an eyebrow. “So you’re stealing angel power… to build a portal?”

Giacomo nodded. “Yeah. Just a little. Not enough to hurt them. But I need energy—holy energy—to open the gate. The backpack charges up when I touch their humans. Just a small draw. Nothing more.”

Julius studied him. He didn’t sense malice in the boy. There was desperation, yes. But no darkness.

“I asked around,” Giacomo added. “They said you’re a dream-walker. A man who can enter the sleep world. I figured if anyone could help, it was you.”

Julius tapped his fingers on the brown table. The story was wild. Preposterous. Which meant it was probably true.

“You may not need a portal,” Julius said finally. “If you come back here at midnight—bring something that belonged to Octavio—I can summon his spirit. Right here. We can speak to him directly.”

Giacomo’s eyes lit up. He reached into his shirt and pulled out a necklace. Hanging from the chain was a single yellowed fang.

“This,” he said, “belonged to my grandfather. A werewolf fang. He pulled it himself from one of the beasts he killed.”

Julius smiled. “That’ll do.”

“I’ll be back at midnight,” Giacomo said, rising. “Thank you, Julius. Really.”

Julius watched him leave. There was hope now. Because this battle wasn’t about strength. Not really. It was a war of the mind—and that just so happened to be Julius Q. Bygone’s favorite kind.

Chapter 4 

It was midnight on Wednesday in Julius’s studio apartment on 14th Street. Giacomo was already seated at the table, anxiously awaiting the spirit of his grandfather. If all went well, the curse would be broken, and he might finally get some rest this weekend. But it wouldn’t be easy.

Julius took the werewolf fang necklace that had once belonged to Octavio and placed it in a ceramic bowl in the center of the table. At the stroke of midnight, he began clapping his hands together rhythmically and chanting in a low, resonant tone. Often, these initial encounters required force—Julius had been known to wrestle a ghost or two into submission—but something told him this one would come more willingly.

From the ceiling, a mist descended—swirling gray and white like fog lit by moonlight. It spiraled slowly downward, then settled on the floor, taking human shape. A strong, stocky figure emerged: white hair to the shoulders, a thick beard, and the presence of a man who had lived through battle and legend.

Giacomo was overcome with emotion.

“Grandpa Octavio,” he said, rising from his seat.

He didn’t need to ask. He knew. Octavio extended a weathered hand, and they touched—two generations reunited in spirit and blood. Julius stood off to the side, giving the moment its space but keeping the business at hand in focus.

“There’s much to discuss,” Julius said gently, steering the meeting forward.

Giacomo turned to his grandfather.

“Grandfather, I’ve fallen victim to the werewolves’ curse. As revenge for you driving them into the forest, they targeted your youngest grandson—me. Every weekend, they attack me in my dreams. They beat me mercilessly until I wake up Monday morning too scared and weak to function. Then it starts again. Every Friday night.”

Octavio listened closely, his expression a mix of compassion and disappointment. His eyes narrowed with the weight of ancestral expectation.

“I had hoped,” Octavio said, “that my grandson would show more fight.”

“I’m not asking you to fight for me,” Giacomo replied firmly. “I know this is my curse, and my burden. I just ask for the weapon you once wielded—the silver-bladed axe. It’s my inheritance, isn’t it? You used it to defeat the werewolf clan and protect the villagers. I want to use it now to protect myself and finally break the curse.”

Octavio nodded solemnly.

“The axe remains where I left it—by the front door of my glass house at the foot of the volcano. I killed my final foe with it—Fang, their leader. A vicious, capable fighter. His death brought peace to the village and to my soul. But that peace has been disturbed. And now it must be restored.”

“Then Friday night, when I dream,” Giacomo said, his confidence growing, “I’ll return to your house, claim the silver axe, and fight the werewolf tribe the way you did.”

Octavio shook his head slightly.

“This is not about the tribe,” he said. “It’s about me and Fang. My blood and his. Your battle won’t be against them—it will be against Claw, Fang’s grandson and their new leader. Your fight is a duel between heirs. If you survive, the curse ends.”

He turned to Julius.

“The fang in that necklace—it belonged to Fang. Use it. Summon him now, so he can accept the final showdown. His blood against mine.”

Julius, wide-eyed with excitement, gave a theatrical flourish and began clapping again, deeper and slower this time. The energy in the room shifted—heavier now, more primal.

From the floor, a thick black smoke began to rise, and with it came a faint, musky scent of earth, sweat, and something darker. Fang emerged—a towering presence with sharp, angular features and the deep, guttural silence of a warrior returned from the grave. It was the first time he had faced Octavio since the moment that silver blade struck him down.

Talk about uncomfortable, Julius thought.

The two stood across from each other like statues, no words exchanged—just the history of blood, battle, and grudging respect passing between them.

Octavio offered the challenge. Fang, still honorable in death, accepted it with a nod. They couldn’t shake hands, but the meaning was clear.

So it was set.

Friday night, when Giacomo drifted into sleep, he would enter the glass house at the volcano’s base, retrieve the silver axe, and battle Claw to end the blood feud once and for all.

Chapter 5

The next morning, Julius arranged a meeting at the church for 10 a.m. between Monsignor Logan—the mystic priest—and the four guardian angels: Mateo, Romeo, Lucas, and Eva, whose Heavenly energy had been siphoned by Giacomo.

Julius strode into the church alongside Giacomo. Morning mass was long over, and the pews were mostly empty, the last of the parishioners having returned to work, still warmed by the Monsignor’s elegant homily. Up front, Monsignor Logan sat alone in silent reflection. He smiled as he caught sight of them walking down the aisle.

They exchanged handshakes, and Giacomo came straight to the point. He asked the Monsignor to summon the four angels. He had something to return to them—and as harmless as it may have turned out to be, he admitted he shouldn’t have taken their energy without permission.

Monsignor Logan chuckled softly and suggested, “Confession—Saturday afternoon?” Then he stood with his palms raised skyward in quiet prayer.

A soft shimmer filled the air as the four guardian angels appeared, with Mateo stepping forward as their spokesman.

Giacomo bowed his head, sincerely apologetic. He removed the backpack containing their stolen energy and handed it to Mateo.

“I know the portal is no longer necessary,” he said. “But I would’ve returned this regardless. I made a mistake. I see that now. I’m sorry—and I ask for your forgiveness.”

The angels were visibly moved. Mateo accepted the pack, and they exchanged glances, their expressions softening.

Monsignor Logan smiled warmly. “No need to wait for Saturday. Your confession is heard. Your sins are forgiven.”

Julius stepped forward and shared the events of the night before—what had happened in his apartment, the revelations, the danger ahead. The angels listened intently, concern etched into their radiant faces.

They warned Giacomo against confronting Claw—but understood that sometimes battle could not be avoided. Even the Heavenly Host knew that, as with Saint Michael and Lucifer. They placed their blessings upon him and promised to support him spiritually in the fight to come.

Overwhelmed by their kindness, Giacomo’s eyes welled up with tears. He quickly composed himself.

“A true spiritual warrior,” said Monsignor Logan, placing a hand on his shoulder. “I sensed it when I first met you. I will pray for you. For your victory, for your healing, and for the curse to be broken—that you might return to yourself, whole and at peace in God’s light.”

Giacomo hugged him and gave heartfelt thanks to each of them. Then he and Julius left the church, sunlight breaking through the clouds as they stepped outside.

He felt clean—cleansed by confession, by truth, and by the grace of forgiveness. But he was scared. Claw was a terrifying enemy. The stakes were as high as they could be.

Still, he felt supported. Blessed. He had friends in Julius, in Monsignor Logan, and in the angels. But most importantly, he had seen his grandfather—the man who once defeated Fang and had passed down to him the magic axe.

Maybe history would repeat itself.

Giacomo was ready.

Chapter 6 

Friday morning, Giacomo woke up at 8 a.m. and ran five miles. He wasn’t trying to stay in shape—he was trying to exhaust himself so he could fall asleep early that night. He was anxious to possess his inheritance: the magic silver axe he would use to take down Claw and free himself once and for all.

His heart beat faster—not from the run, but from his nerves.

“Come on,” he said to himself. “You can do this.”

Julius had promised to act as his second. As a Dream Walker, Julius had the rare power to enter the dreams of others.

Giacomo ate light—just one meal around noon. He fried up some chopped beef from the fridge and made himself a small salad with lettuce and red vinegar. That was it. He wanted to stay hungry. He couldn’t wait to fall asleep.

By 10 p.m., he lay down. His eyes were heavy, and he wasn’t fighting it. He rolled onto his side and, within minutes, he was standing next to Julius in Catania, Sicily, at the foot of the volcano.

There it was—his grandfather’s glass house, just as he had imagined.

He turned the doorknob and stepped inside. There, just as promised, was Octavio’s axe—silver-bladed, gleaming. He held it for the first time. It was heavier than he thought, and he needed both hands to lift it.

“Steady,” Julius said. “That’s the one thing these werewolves fear most in the world.”

Giacomo took a deep breath, encouraged.

They stepped outside. It was time.

They walked to the edge of the forest, to a clearing lit by moonlight. Across the way, something rustled in the trees. Claw emerged, towering, snarling, with a second werewolf beside him named Bite.

Behind Giacomo, he could see the angelic glow of Mateo, Romeo, Lucas, and Eva. Their presence felt like the answer to a prayer.

Julius whispered steady encouragement. “You’ve got Octavio’s blood in you.”

Giacomo wasn’t afraid—but he wasn’t overconfident, either. He wasn’t a fighter like Julius, a seasoned ghost-wrestler.

“Remember to summon the shadows, like I taught you,” Julius said.

There was no time left to delay.

Claw was already in the center of the clearing, sniffing blood.

As Giacomo approached, axe in hand, it felt heavier with each step. His legs were shaky. He fought not to let Claw see his fear—which was tipping into panic.

But Claw didn’t need to see it. He could smell it. His confidence grew.

He would avenge his grandfather Fang and free his tribe from the forest’s depths to raid the villagers once more.

They circled each other. Claw beckoned him.

“Drop the axe, and I’ll make this quick. Hold onto it, and it’ll be slow.”

Giacomo considered it. But instead of cowering, he swung the axe at Claw’s head with both hands.

Claw countered fast and hard. His sharp hooves struck Giacomo’s legs, sending him to the ground. Giacomo rolled back to his feet, trying to angle the axe to create Octavio’s forcefield—but it wouldn’t work.

Claw saw the struggle and pressed harder. He pounced, pinning Giacomo to the ground.

Julius shouted encouragement, but it was fading. Giacomo summoned the shadows from the trees—an old trick Julius had taught him. The tendrils wrapped around Claw’s thighs. But Claw was too strong. That move worked on ghosts, not werewolves.

Giacomo began to lose hope. He couldn’t match Claw. The axe felt useless. His limbs trembled. Panic overtook him.

Claw loomed above, laughing—a deep, savage howl.

“How could this be Octavio’s grandson?” he sneered.

Claw raised his clawed arm, ready to strike.

Giacomo went still. The axe was nearby, but why bother? “Just get it over with,” he whispered, resigned.

But then he prayed.

God, please.

Suddenly, Mateo reached beneath his robe and produced Giacomo’s old backpack—the one filled with the Heavenly power he had siphoned from the four guardians. Mateo opened it slightly and tossed it underhand toward Giacomo.

The pack landed beside him, glowing.

Giacomo grabbed it and pressed it to his chest. The light surged into him. He stopped shaking.

Claw, momentarily confused, hesitated.

Giacomo seized the moment. He reached for the axe—now light as a feather—and, with a cry from deep within, struck Claw down. A clean blow, right between the eyes.

Claw collapsed.

Giacomo sat up in bed, gasping.

It was over. The nightmare. The fear.

It had all been in his head.

But he had stood up to it—with prayer, with courage.

And he had won.

Saturday Morning

He fell back asleep and woke again around 10 a.m. The sun was bright.

For the first time, he felt the world was his again”

He had toast and jogged to Tompkins Square Park.

There was Julius on the handball court, dominating a pair of sixty-year-old brothers—two on one.

When Julius spotted Giacomo, he let the ball drop. “You guys win,” he called.

He walked over. “We’re all proud of you, you know. Especially Octavio. He was there all along. He put the axe back in the glass house after you were done with it. Didn’t think there’d be any more use for it.”

Giacomo smiled and shook his hand. “Thank you. You’re a great second. I had my first good night’s sleep in a year.
I felt lighter, as if the weight of a thousand nightmares had lifted.”

Julius threw an arm around his shoulder.

1kspcwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kspcwg/i_slept_with_a_former_student_and_now_i_may_be/,I slept with a former student and now I may be the father of her kid,"I am a high school teacher (for ages 15-19 here where I live). Roughly over half a year ago, the class I was the lead teacher of for four years arranged a meet up, inviting the whole class, me and a few other teachers they were fond of. I am, at least when it comes to school's in my area, a young teacher. I am 31, soon to be 32 years old, while most of the teachers I know are aged from 50-60. I think this is the cause of me being very favorite amongst my students. The boys usually act very friendly towards me, pulling harmless pranks in my classes, while the girls are usually more open to me about their problems, both personal and school-related. One of the girls in the former class was always very close to me. When she came to the school, her parents were freshly divorced, she moved to a new town and everything was very stressful for her. Sometimes, she would come to me for advice and I helped her with a lot of her studies when it came to my subjects. Well, at the meet up, we spoke again. She was already much better off mentally at the end of high school, but just a few months later, she was an entirely new person. Apparently, she landed a really good part-time job in the field she studied and also applied and got accepted to a good Uni. We talked for hours and got a bit drunk together (Drinking age here is 18, she is 20, so all is good). After the meet up, I offered to accompany her on her way home because she told me she feels scared going alone through the city at night. Well, when we got to her place, she invited me in for a coffee. I didn't really suspect much, she didn't act flirty or anything, so I said why not. Instead of coffee, we drank vodka and we basically got wasted and of course, it all ended in the bed. We used condoms and she was on the pill. In the morning, I told her I need to go because I have a lot of work and I felt terrible. It was one of my rules that I never want to have any kind of inapproriate relationship with any of my students, even former. She reached out a few times after and we chatted for a bit, but neither of us ever mentioned the night again or made any plans to see each other again. Until last week, when she texted me that she ""needs to see me"". We met up in a café and the moment I saw her I almost got a stroke. She walked into the café with a baby bump. I politely greeted her and she went right to the core of the conversation. ""I wanted to tell you before it's born. I was planning on telling you multiple times now, but never really found the words."" Well, she told me it's mine and that we should somehow work out how to tell it to our families and how we will care of the baby. Honestly, the conversation led kind of nowhere as I was completely stumped and most of the time didn't even know what to say. I fucked up monumentally. I cannot lose my job because of this and I cannot get in any problems, but from a moral standpoint, it's just absolutely wild and I absolutely hate myself for it. As you might imagine, I don't really have anyone around me to tell this to, so I wanted to say it at least to the internet, just to finally let out the story. If there will be anyone interested, I may post some updates to the story over time, but I am unsure if I will have the guts to do that, I guess it depends how all of this will go on.",0,1747916666.0,TrueOffMyChest,33,0.45,False
1kspco3,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1kspco3/i_know_correlation_doesnt_equal_causation_but_i/,"I know correlation doesn't equal causation, but I still have a question","I have a question because I am curious. 

Was your cheater enmeshed with a sibling? Mine was. 

He (M/52) always treated his sister more like a wife than he did me. They lived together during their adulthood for years, vacationed together and went on long weekend trips together, were each other's plus-one to events, planned to buy a house together and live in it permanently, made major financial decisions together (sharing streaming services), and more. 

The sister moved away, and STBX visited her each year for a week. Their parents lived in the same area, but he would visit them only for a few hours. Meanwhile, he and his sister would spend a week dining out, going for coffee/tea late, going to the movies, planning their future vacations together, and so on. 

Eventually, STBX and I moved closer to the sister again. He insisted that it was normal for him to be gone all weekend long with her for dinner dates, coffee outings, movies, long drives, because their dad was unwell, and they ""needed to plan."" Every weekend. All weekend long. I simply was a mean hag for not ""understanding."" 

In my gut, I know this is weird shit, although STBX claims this is normal and how adults are with their siblings.

1ksp5x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1ksp5x3/just_got_home/,Just got home.,"I’ve been lurking here for a while and found it very helpful so thought I’d pass it forward.
I’m 62, UK based, no symptoms but there was blood in my poo test so they wanted to check. 
I had a Thursday screening so switched to a low fibre diet from Monday through to Wednesday. Easy peasy. 
Prep - I was more bothered about the prep than the procedure. I had Plenvu and Dose 1 was scheduled for 8.00pm. I favour a morning poo after a strong coffee and it’s rare I poo after midday but on Wednesday evening I had to have one at about 7.00 - mind over fecal matter perhaps. Dose 1 was mango flavour, but salty. It’s not lovely but I followed each slurp with a sip of water that took the saltiness away and left a more pleasant taste. It took about an hour to kick in and I went three times between 9 and 10.30. They were all fine and each time my body gave me enough warning and it didn’t trouble my sleep. 
My appointment was early so I had to take Dose 2 at 5.30. Fruit punch allegedly, tasted like bubblegum. Once more it kicked in after an hour or so and I pood liquid two or three times.
I drove 45 minutes to the hospital, never felt in danger of a poo. 
Procedure - I wouldn’t say painful but definitely uncomfortable, more from the air pumped in than the camera. As I was driving I could not have sedation but I could use gas and air. I didn’t use it until it got uncomfortable. With hindsight I would say it will almost certainly get uncomfortable so hit the gas and air straight away. 
The literature I was sent in advance said I might be there 5 hours and I didn’t feel I could ask the Mrs to drive me and hang around that long. In reality I was in and out in 90 minutes which seems to be the norm. If you are nervous about the discomfort/pain get a lift or a cab and have sedation.
Drove home, no issues, felt farty but nothing more.
Interestingly it is now 24 hours since I ate a small lunch of rice and I don’t feel hungry yet. 
For the record everything seemed fine.
Good luck everyone.
