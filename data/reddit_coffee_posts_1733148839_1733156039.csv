Adulthood is, in fact, difficult

Work, home, looking after yourself, friendships, relationships, finances, rest days/holidays

Managing all this is actually difficult 

I feel exhausted all the time, it is hard to manage it all. 

Now I understand why people smoke, drink alcohol and coffee and play games, eventhough it is highly destructive for the health, I understand how much they wanna just relax or have more energy to do things, every day waking up for the same job and making money is not an easy thing.

I do feel exhausted, I feel tired and I have so much to achieve and work for. 

I am happy I can manage these things, because I started it long time ago, I just put so much of effort and time into building strong base of taking care of myself. 

I don't wanna run for anything or anyone if my health is not prioritised. 

My health is the only thing I truly can value, brcause if im gonna get sick one day - everything falls down. 

I don't have any bad habits, I eat very great, do exercises daily, drink water, stay safe, go on walks, active daily, stay positive and re-wire my brain into better thinking, stay out of stress and just meditate. 

I feel tired all the time and I don't know why, I just feel it, maybe i do have some problems with thyroid, but im not sure.

1h4ye8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1h4ye8h/overcame_cpps_insight_resilience_and_my_journey/,"Overcame CPPS: Insight, Resilience and My Journey.","This post is for those of you who’ve been dealing with this issue for months (perhaps even years), have been given the all clear and yet still have chronic pain. I want to give you some insights and strategies that I wish I knew in hindsight. No doubt like some of you reading this, I was once feeling like a broken man from prostatitis/CPPS, wondering if I’d ever get back to normal, be in a relationship, or just enjoy life ever again. 

I chased a phantom infection for two years since my issue started with urethritis caused by a UTI. I felt I was completely neglected and gaslit by doctors and urologists, and I felt like I’d entered the twilight zone dealing with them. Apparently it was all in my head and one even told me it would go away when I ‘get a girlfriend’.

On top of the usual set of symptoms, I developed severe testicular pain that greatly affected my ability to walk at times. This caused me to feel extremely desperate and depressed. In those days there was no Reddit, only questionable forums online with other desperate men who had been destroyed by their condition. These people just fed my desperation, and the echo chamber made me feel like I was even more doomed. 

I’m so much better now, I have some flares but I range from 80-95% recovered. Most importantly, this condition does not rule my life anymore, I don’t even really think about it these days. I’m in a relationship with a great girl who’s very understanding if I ever have a couple of days where I’m a bit uncomfortable. 

As others have posted here, the key for me was actually just time. Your nervous system needs time to forget the original ‘insult’, whether it’s an infection, injury or period of stress. Pain is basically an alarm system when your body perceives danger and the more your fear it and practice avoidance behaviours, the more you gear your nervous system to produce more pain in response to the ‘danger’. 

It is scientifically proven that people who catostrophise, ruminate or obsess about their condition have worse pain outcomes - the pain is worse and the condition lasts longer for these patients. What’s the answer to this? To gradually return to normality as best you can - live life, see family and friends, invest in support networks instead of isolating yourself. This will be a lifeline. In short, train your nervous system to begin to loosen its grip on that original ‘insult’ that caused this condition for you. View the condition a little less seriously, treat it as a temporary annoyance that will go away rather than a complete disaster. Don’t fear the pain and remind yourself (and your nervous system in the process) that you’re safe 

One important thing to realise is that how we react to adversity is something that defines us. When something bad happens, most of us hope to get back to where we were before, and often we just shrink into some slightly worse version of ourselves after a setback. But there is a ‘third route’ where we can actually grow and become better from adversity. 

Every successful person has experienced failures and the biggest businesses even sometimes purposely set themselves up to fail in a specific area in order to learn from adversity. In the end, the techniques they learn during the adverse situation are adopted in ‘normal’ times, because they were superior to how they operated before. 

What can you learn from your battle with CPPS? To be more mindful, less prone to catostrophise and to approach life with a lightness by taking things a bit less seriously when it seems like a disaster has hit. By taking this ‘third route’ you’re building resilience instead of conditioning yourself for learned helplessness in the face of adversity. 

You might feel overwhelmed, but the key is to start with small things that you can control and gradually build from there, eventually giving you more control over the condition and sending you on an upwards spiral. Are you catastrophising? Address it by asking yourself how likely it really is that you’re going to suffer from this forever when there are so many people who’ve gotten better. Ask yourself what steps you can take to get better - mindfulness, physiotherapy, living life with family and friends. Finally, ask yourself if it really helps to keep worrying about this over and over - I’m sure you already know the answer.

Doing few small things each day that help your condition + not behaving in an excessive way that causes more pain and discomfort = manageable improvement over time. Start small and you’ll get there - your body will gradually forget about the original ‘insult’.

Recovery isn’t linear, but it’s completely possible and in my opinion, is highly likely given enough time. Focus on what you can control; maybe that’s doing a gentle physio therapy exercise today or taking 10 minutes out to practice a mindful meditation. I’m not some unique case and I’m so much better than I was, you can do it too.

2. Does everyone stick to the 60grams:1Litre ratio? I will be brewing a full pot everyday so I would need 70grams of beans, seems like a lot of beans per day. I typically like my coffee a medium strength. I know I can adjust based on taste/preference but wanted to see what ratio others use.
3. I just noticed this morning that the cups on the carafe are ""European cups"" and the total volume is 40oz(not sure how I missed this). Does a full carafe brew 4 cups of coffee?(dependent on cups size obviously)

They are from this country and have an established friend group and 1 person in that group is 16 years old. I have a problem with this age difference as a friend. I think it is problematic for me as a 28 year old to befriend a 16 year old, not just for nefarious reasons but because I have nothing to offer a 16yo in terms of life/interests as we are in such different stages.  So I haven't hung out with them outside of the context of hanging out in their social circle because of the 25f person I did befriend. However, we did follow each other on social media, which was my first mistake. And it became clear to me yesterday that I think the 16year old sees me as a friend because we were at a coffee shop all together and we ended up walking to a store after, just the 16yo and I. I left that hangout feeling uneasy because I thought I was giving this 16yo mixed signals about being a friend and that I was compromising my own values. So after I went home and thought about it, I texted the 25f person to say (summarized) ""hey, I have an issue with this age difference thing, I need you to know that I will only be around this person in the context of you and me and this person and I are not friends."" They understood at first but were like, I need to tell the 16yo because they think differently and they will be sad to know this. Which I get, and then they were told by the 25yo and were confused, sad, and understanding. 

My questions are, how do I get past this guilt within the friendship? I feel bad for not being clear at the beginning with the 16yo that them and I will not be friends and they were told by someone else (which wasn't my intention to happen, but it did so here we are). How do I not feel shame for not being an upfront person whenever I hang out with this 25yo again? Is this irreparable? Is it worth another conversation with the 25yo or do I just leave it because these are feelings about how I conducted myself and that takes self work?",1,1733155180.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

The relationship moved steadily, and we would hang one night a week during the first two months. Date nights were fun and intimate, and we started to become physical after the three-week mark. Our values and vision for the future aligned and I felt I had met my person.

She told me she felt safe and secure and started asking for more time with me. She invited me to meet her brother and sister-in-law, and everything felt cozy and natural. She was very texty and present when we would spend time together.

The next week was her birthday, and she invited me to her parents' house to celebrate (she lived with them). During the invite, she trauma dumped about her abusive ex who she had filed a restraining order against which was unexpected, but I supported her through it. She also stated that, in relationships, she would tend to ""become who she wanted her partners to be"". I told her that, with me, that I wanted her to be ""her"" and that the past is the past and we can focus on having a beautiful future together.

The party went great, her family loved me, and all felt right in the world. The next morning, however, she ended the relationship via text, became cold and distant, and gave me no closure (not even a phone call). I was devastated and chased for a few weeks which resulted in heated exchanges. She re-wrote history and said that I was ""narcissistic"" and ""didn't listen to her."" Further, she said that it was strange that I found her attractive because of how ""sickly she was"" at the time, that she ""hated surprises yet I surprised her with dinners which meant I didn't care about her"", and that she, after each of our hang outs, would ""swear that it would be the last time"". The last text I received from her was, from memory, ""Ewww, how could I have ever even considered going out with you? \*\*\*\* you, <my name>. Blocked and forgotten"".

Anyway, nearly two years later, we ran into each other, and she text me after. She said she hadn't dated since me so she could ""get her life in order"" and wasn't planning until dating until she healed from a scheduled surgery in January. She invited me to a coffee, and I agreed under the pretense of it being a ""friendly catch up.""

We caught up and didn't get too deep or anything, but it was nice. Afterward, she started to become flirtier and more suggestive of romance. She invited me out to ice-cream a week later and we were touchier and flirtier and made out in the parking lot. She then asked me out to a hike a few weeks later, and we agreed to continue forward. During this time, met with my therapist for guidance as my curiosity was slowly being replaced by concern that the same situation was unfolding that devastated me once before. He encouraged me to address the past with her, as soon as possible, before proceeding forward.

A few days after my meeting with my therapist (and a few days before the hike), I was in her area, and we agreed to grab dinner. We spoke about the past (I brought it up, per conversations with my therapist) and we addressed what happened the first time. She stated she was ""so lost"" back then and apologized for hurting me. She said she could only give me pieces of her and if she gave anything else that she ""would have shattered"". She said she needed time with her family and away from relationships in order to heal, understand why she chose toxic partners, and get her life in order and that we were ""right people, wrong time"". I also apologized for any hurt during my post-breakup chasing. We agreed that we were both at a better place. She then invited me to Thanksgiving at her parents' which I accepted.

On Sunday we hiked together which went great. We grabbed dinner after, and she was vulnerable again and stated that her surgery was a partial-hysterectomy and that she would not be able to conceive children. I supported her and told her it wasn't a deal-breaker for me (truly, it would have been if I had known before developing feelings for her again). She talked openly with me, and we revisited our prior conversation about the past and what we needed to do to avoid what happened the first time.

We spoke more about the future and expectations of how to do better. She was very transparent and forthcoming. She then asked if we could be exclusive again, to which I agreed (\*internally hesitant, I might add). She committed to being ""open, honest, present, and communicative - always"" with me. We then agreed to have a movie night the Sunday after Thanksgiving.

Thanksgiving went great and it was a lot of fun seeing her family. The Deja-vu anxiety was creeping in, however. After, we hugged and kissed in her driveway and I drove home, praying that things would be different.

The next morning, she text and all was well. Phew. Texting continued throughout the day, and I felt a bit more relaxed. She was chatty and inquisitive, and I truly felt that we were re-writing history. On Saturday, however, she ended things via text in the same fashion as before, even making note of how ""this will feel like Deja-vu."" She also said that she was going to ""step away from her phone to give the situation some space"".

The reasons? She made a ""promise to herself"" not to date someone again who had ""hurt her in the past"" and that she didn't feel we were compatible for a slew of nit-picked random reasons, one of which being a flirty meme I sent in response to her own flirty meme post-Thanksgiving. My meme was of Tom Cruise stating, ""you complete me"". Though she ""love reacted"" to the message and gushed after receiving it at the time, she stated that she doesn't want ""to complete someone"" and that she wants a relationship where we ""amplify each other's lives"".

She also said that someone else having expectations of her was overwhelming to the point of her losing sleep and being emotionally drained. Though she pushed for our initial hangouts, a relationship label, and Thanksgiving, etc., she said that she also ""promised herself"" not to date until after her surgery and the thought of being in a relationship with me ""after the past we've had"" felt wrong and that, although we both may have changed, the timing ""still didn't feel right"" and that we should ""close the book for good"".

I asked for a phone call, bringing up our promise to be open, honest, and communicative, and she said she *was* respecting that promise by sending the break-up text. She also said that ""we're not having a phone call. I never promised one, and I don't want to."" The exact same reaction she had nearly two years prior. When I said we could work through this by communicating, and that we had an opportunity to do things differently this time by remaining committed to what we agreed to by entering a relationship together and that most of what she stated were based on assumptions without my input and not facts, she said, ""Why would I want to talk to someone else when it's a personal decision not to be in a relationship?""

Once I saw the fangs coming out again, I knew I had to back down and behave as securely as possible with respect to myself and the growth I had made since our first go-around. Rather than going back and forth as I did before, I sent a final text, which was:

""The meme I sent was just that - a meme. I sent it to be funny and flirty as we usually were after hanging out. I don't want someone to complete me. I want to amplify their life and for me to amplify theirs, as you said. I didn't want ""picture perfect"". I wanted you.

Had you raised your fears and concerns with me earlier and granted me a voice so we could collaborate, we could have worked through this. A unilateral disregard of our commitment to one another, after inviting me into your home and welcoming a relationship with me, is not simply a personal decision; it is a breach of trust and integrity with respect to what you had told me when we had our dinners together.

However, I do respect your sovereignty over your life and decision. Thank you so much for dinner and the hike and everything. That was very kind of you, and I enjoyed our time together. Best wishes, <name>.

With care, <my name>""

She simply responded with, ""Thank you. Best wishes <my name>."" And that was that.

My therapist believes that there could be more going on than just attachment (perhaps BPD). I'm doing better this time around - something about the re-affirmation of the behavior confirming how it has nothing to do with me I suppose. Is this typical of a BPD situation?",1,1733154980.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False
1h4y4np,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueScaryStories/comments/1h4y4np/light_in_the_sky/,Light in the sky,"My whole life I’ve suffered from sleep related issues. I’m 26m and around 8 years ago something really strange happened.

When I was really young my sister passed away. Her death spiked a number of issues with me. The main issue was sleep, I’d become so scared of death I’d carry weapons to bed and lay stiff as a board falling victim to the horrors of my own imagination. My condition consisted of mainly night terrors and sleep paralysis.

My mother is an amazing human being. Shes very spiritual and very caring. When I was young she’d give me dream catchers to help with my nightmares and I also recall her giving me a ring with an eye to watch over me as I slept. My mother has made some very strange claims in her life. She’s actually been on the BBC radio and mentioned in a few books based on some of the experiences she’s had under the premise of spiritual/supernatural happenings but what I saw that night didn’t feel like either. 

My mother claimed to have had a spiritual awakening, which to some degree I believe in. One day she was normal and the next she had changed. I remember being at school waiting for her to pick me up but she was late. We were in the car when she finally arrived and she was struggling to drive, she explained she’d just had to pull the car over at a local supermarket because of this “spiritual awakening”. Naturally since dealing with nightmares Id become aware of things seeming very real when they’re actually not. Therefore I’m quite the skeptic when it comes to things of this theme. But she had changed. My mother had unlocked knowledge, since that day she became extremely smart, she had an answer for everything. Her emotions had levelled and her mind became unbelievably sharp. Don’t get me wrong she was still herself, she was just a smarter, calmer version. 

With this new knowledge of hers came new solutions to problems; one of which being my night terrors. She explained that she could teach me to lucid dream meaning i’d be aware I’m dreaming and take control and she did exactly that. It started with listening to a mans voice on a cd and setting “triggers” basically Id touch the tips of my fingers until I’d fallen asleep. Eventually something strange happened. I committed to my usual practice until I nodded off. I remembered looking down at my hands and noticing I was stood up. I was in the middle of a desert filled with old shipping containers. Then and there I knew Id finally done it, I was awake while asleep. Though I soon realised controlling my dreams wouldn’t be as easy as I thought. Every thought that popped into my head fabricated before my eyes and before I knew it there was too much going on to comprehend. I remember walking into a container and thinking “Its too quiet I wish there were some other people here” and instantly appeared two lifeless, dead eyed, still cold men. As my brain exploded into confusion and fear the men were torn apart violently. I woke up in a cold sweat.

My theory was that I couldn’t create people because I was trying to create people who’d I’d never met. Your mind can’t invent a person from thin air it needs references. 

I could go on for hours about my various experiences but I’ll cut to the chase a little.

The light in the sky was something weirder than normal. One night I’d fallen asleep under the normal practice of touching my finger tips but this time when Id gained control of my sleep I wanted to roam around my house. Since I know my home well I assumed less would go wrong. I’m touching my finger tips until I drift into thought, I then realise I’ve stopped so I begin doing it again, I then realise I’m already asleep and I’m still in my house. Basically things had gone to plan. All seems normal at first and I can see my sleeping body on the bed, things look relatively similar but my brain had made some small changes to colours and the type of furniture I had.

There was one major difference, there was a light in the sky. 

I could see it through my window, a VERY bright, deep blue light. The light glared from the sides as if I had a visual stigmatism. At first I didn’t think too much of it since I’ve seen weirder in my dreams and decide to venture through my house. I begin by opening my door and walking down the stairs. My staircase lead down into the living room that was connected to the dining room. The two rooms separated by an open archway. I stood at the bottom step and looked through both rooms to see my mother in her dressing gown staring at the light through our patio doors. Confused I walk over and stand beside her to get a closer look when the unthinkable happens. 

I hear the words “its woken you up too?” I look to my left and my mother is looking me dead in the eyes as if nothing unusual was happening. She clearly saw the light and heard the faint buzzing emitting from it but two things made this scenario make no sense at all. Two things made this situation feel unsafe. First of all, I was not there, I was asleep in my room. I wasn’t there, I had made this house in my head. The second thing was something I mentioned early. I CANNOT make people, I was completely incapable of thinking up a person. I don’t know why, but whenever I was in control I couldn’t make a person that didn’t simply resemble a dummy. I then as if within the blink of an eye woke up the next morning.

I concluded that I was able to conjure my mother up in my dream simply because I knew her well enough. I went downstairs to make myself a coffee and there she was in the kitchen wearing the same dressing gown. She looks at me and says “did you sleep alright?” That weird light kept me up all night” I mentioned that it was weird and asked if she ever figured out what it was. She had no idea. To this day I’ve never told her that I was actually in bed asleep that night. I’m sure she would just tell me I’m remembering it wrong. But I know for a fact that I was asleep. 

I’d like to note that I also suffer from dyslexia and this is my first time writing this so I hope it’s legible, much love everyone. ",1,1733154896.0,TrueScaryStories,0,1.0,False

1h4y3pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueScaryStories/comments/1h4y3pj/guardian_angel/,Guardian Angel,"I previously posted House Already Occupied and Invited Guest. Posting my stories has helped me release so much old fear around the spirits that haunted me. Now, I'll share a spooky but ultimately mostly positive (for me) experience.

My family all goes to a traditional conservative church that I also attended until I was 16 or so, around the time of this story. My family wasn't as strict with my sister and I as other families were with their daughters. One of my friends, Ann, came from a stricter than usual family. She could only wear long skirts and high necked, long sleeved tops or dresses (not required by our religion by the way). She wasn't allowed to drive or do extra activities like school clubs or sports, unless I did. Ann's father trusted me and would allow me to drive Ann around, or let her join the soccer team if I did, things like that.

One day, Ann asked me to drive her to the next town over after school one day to the larger library for a school report. (Yes, yes, this was in the days before the internet and most of my friends didn't have computers at home.) I agreed to drive her. Her father talked to us about what we could do and not do, no boys, no rock music, no going to certain food places, no coffee, ect. Ann was super excited. I was happy I could do this for her as she never got to go anywhere or do anything and I felt bad for her. I happily agreed to bring my cassette tapes (yep no CD player in my old car) so she could listen to the forbidden music on the ride.

After I agreed, I started having reoccurring nightmares about Ann, every night, sometimes multiple times a night. In the dream, Ann gave me directions to the ""library"" as we drove, only it wasn't the library, it was a bar. She gets out of the car, and there is an older guy there, like mid to late 20s (we were 16) on a motorcycle, who she obviously knows. She says he's her boyfriend and runs up to him. In the dream, the ugly smirk of this guys face when she tmran to him, and gross up-and-down way he looked at me, was neuseating and fills me with dread. To this day 30 years later I can still see that guy and the disgusting look in his eyes in my mind though I never actually met him. I'm angry and frightened to be 16 at a biker bar. My family wasn't as strict but we didn't go to bars and I'd never been to this area. Ann goes into the bar with this guy. I have to say, in the dream, the other bikers in the bar were curious about us and some some were concerned and asked if our parents knew we were there, if we needed help, told us to go home, stuff like that, but they all didn't like Ann's ""boyfriend"". I was't scared or threatened by the other gus, but Ann's boyfriend had such a negative feeling about him it made me sick. 

In the dreams, Ann was always fawning over this guy. In the dream, I learned his name but I can't remember it now so I'll call him Jon. Jon was nasty mean manipulative. In the dream, he was insulting to Ann, got her to do whatever humiliating thing he asked like showing her bra to the bar or dancing, which she couldn't do because music and dancing wasn't allowed in her house, and making fun of the sweater and long skirt she wore, of the ""old lady"" bra she wore.

Anyway, in every dream, Jon would get into a fight with another guy who shows up later. Knives would be drawn. In every dream, over and over, no matter what I did, either Ann would get stabbed and die trying to intervene or I would get stabbed and die trying to save Ann, or we would both die. The dreams were very vivid and dramatic. When I died, I would feel the knife go into me, the blood pumping out of me and feel myself get weaker and weaker and darkness coming over me. It wasn't always the exact same events. I'd try different things to talk her into leaving or to try to save her. Sometimes we'd almost make it to the car, but her boyfriend would catch up to us and keep us from leaving. There was a payphone outside, but in the dream, it didn't work.

My mom could see something was wrong and asked me, so I told her. She told me these dreams were warnings from God and I should listen to them.

I confronted my friend. She didn't admit it at first, insisting we were going to the library, but I knew Jon's name and what he looked like. She was shocked. I told her I wouldn't give her a ride. The dreams stopped. For a few nights. Then they started up again only I wasn't in them and only Ann died. When I asked Ann, she smugly admitted she'd found another ride. I tried everything to convince her not to go but she wouldn't listen. I even threatened to tell her controlling father which I didn't want to do as I was afraid he would control her even more, but she said she'd just run away. I believed she would as other girls in our church had and it didn't turn out well for them as they were easy targets for predatory people.

Then, I decided in my 16 year old wisdom, that I could save Ann, that I was getting these dreams so I could save her. I told her I'd changed my mind and I would driver her. I didn't tell my family. I thought I could handle it myself.

The morning of the day I was supposed to drive Ann, my parents were both at work and my sister was at a morning church Bible study so I was alone. 

I heading for the door, backpack on one shoulder, books, keys and purse in my arms, so confident in my ability to save my friend.

""No,"" a voice clearly said behind me. I felt someone behind me, but when I looked, no one was there. 

If you've read my previous posts, you know that I'd seen, heard and felt spirits often in my life ever since I could remember,, that I found it terrifying, and by the time I was a teenager, I'd developed a partially successful strategy of ignoring, denying, and forgetting as a way of dealing with it. So, though the hair stood up on my neck and arms, I turned away from the presence and ignored the voice.

I started for the door again. A hand landed on my shoulder, and again the voice said, ""no!"" Louder, closer, a raised voice, clearly heard.

I spun around, but still, no one was there, but I felt someone still, I felt them closer. I had that acid electric skin crawling feeling I get when a spirit is around. I said out loud that they weren't real, that they had to leave me alone, that I was going to school, that they were scaring me, and had to go away and not come back. In the past, that often worked with spirits.

I turned again to go to school, and the hand grabbed me by the shoulder and pulled me backwards. I had to drop everything I was carrying, backpack falling off my shoulder, and throw my arms out for balance. The voice yelled directly unto my ear, ""NO!!""

Shaken, I leaned on the desk. I said out loud, that, OK, I wouldn't drive Ann, I had to go to school, if I agreed to not drive Ann, could I leave. The feeling of the presence backed off. 

I went to school and told Ann I wouldn't drive her. I told her about my dreams, about the voice and hand on my shoulder, and I told her she should break up with Jon because he was dangerous. 

Ann was pissed. She wanted me to drive her, and she begged and cried and threatened. She threatened to lie about me to my parents, to her oarents, to out church. I wouldn't give in. A huge weight lifted from me. Ann tried to get another ride on short notice but thankfully couldn't.

Ann was mad and told everyone at school that I was a lier and crazy. 

The next day, I saw her in the hallway, and went over to try to talk to her. She got a wide eyed look of pure terror and ran the other way. Anytime she saw me, she'd react like that, go completely pale, look utterly terrifed, and run away. 

A mutual friend explained that Ann was acting that way because her boyfriend had been injured in a knife fight the night before as was in the hospital.

He’s a teacher at ESU full time, Spider-Man most of the time, Peter Parker part time (but that’s beginning to change). 

The script asks the question “how do we move on from someone we wasn’t ready to loose”, that for Aunt May can be with Uncle Ben and for Peter be with Gwen. It’s just as much a story for MJ as for Peter. She’s so important to Spider-Man’s history and I think perfectly fits Andrew’s Peter’s world.

1h4xzts,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_subashbusiness95/comments/1h4xzts/does_green_tea_help_with_weight_loss/,Does Green Tea Help with Weight Loss?,"Imagine sipping something warm, soothing, and **packed with fat-burning power**. That’s what green tea offers. Studies suggest people who drink green tea regularly burn **3-4% more calories** each day. Sounds tiny, right? But think about it—this stacks up over weeks and months.

So, let’s talk about green tea’s cooler cousin but with a twist. This metabolism-boosting elixir borrows ideas from **Japanese herbal remedies**, adding an extra kick to target stubborn fat. Unlike plain ol’ tea, it blends herbs and nutrients aimed at energy levels and quicker calorie burn.

How does it work? Well, similar to green tea, it taps into natural fat-burning processes. Ever heard of *thermogenesis*? That’s when your body burns more energy to increase heat—and ingredients like green tea **supercharge this effect**. But Nagano Tonic might go the extra mile with its special plant extracts.

Feeling tired halfway through the day? People using metabolism boosters like this one often report an energy boost, too. Whether it’s the caffeine in green tea or those magical Japanese-inspired herbs, your body feels alive.

So, yeah, green tea can help—with weight loss, fat burn, and maybe just a bit of motivation to keep moving. **Why not turn a little cup of tea into a long-term tool?**

**How Does Green Tea Aid in Weight Loss?**

Can something as simple as **tea help you lose fat**? Green tea might just be the secret weapon you’re looking for. It’s not magic—there are real, science-backed reasons why it works. Let’s break it down.

# Metabolism Boosting Properties

Ever felt like your metabolism is stuck in slow motion? Green tea speeds it up. The caffeine and antioxidants inside it **wake up your body's fat furnace**. You’re burning calories even doing nothing. Sounds cool, huh?

# Caffeine's Role in Green Tea

So, here’s the deal—green tea isn’t overloaded with caffeine like coffee, but it has *just enough*. That small dose can give you energy, make you feel focused, and boost calorie burning. Plus, caffeine is known to **mobilize fat**, meaning it pushes fat cells to release stored fat so your body can burn it for energy.

# EGCG and Antioxidants: The Silent Heroes

Green tea has a superstar antioxidant called **EGCG** (epigallocatechin gallate). No need to remember the name, but know this: EGCG boosts metabolism and helps destroy fat. It works as a team with caffeine to push your body to burn even more. Antioxidants like these fight off free radicals, too, which may make weight loss easier for your body.

# Fat Burning and Oxidation

So, what really happens inside your body? Green tea revs up ""fat oxidation."" Big term, simple meaning: your body uses fat as fuel. Imagine your body being better at *grabbing fat* for energy instead of just carbs—it’s like running a more efficient machine.

# Thermogenesis and Energy

There’s this fancy process called **thermogenesis**—it’s when your body burns calories to warm itself up. Green tea amps this up, helping you torch calories just by existing. Ever feel warm after tea? That’s thermogenesis kicking in.

# What Does Science Say?

Researchers have studied this for years, and green tea keeps delivering results. In some studies, people using green tea extract burned *17% more fat* compared to those who didn’t. That’s *huge*! Another study found people who drank it saw greater belly fat loss over weeks compared to others using different remedies.

# Why Green Tea Over Other Remedies?

Honestly, some natural weight loss options are overhyped or come with bad side effects. Green tea? It’s simple, safe, and healthy. You’re not just losing fat—you’re getting antioxidants, fighting inflammation, and boosting energy.

So, does green tea help with weight loss? **Absolutely.** It doesn’t work overnight, but it’s gentle, consistent, and backed by science. Why not sip some and see where it takes you?

# Green Tea and Appetite Control

Did you know green tea might help you eat less without even trying? Sounds unreal, right? Turns out, green tea does more than just boost metabolism—it could also quiet your appetite. Scientists say its natural properties may help slow down the signals that tell your brain *""I'm starving!""*. That means fewer random snack attacks.

There’s also something about green tea that makes cravings disappear. Maybe it’s the combo of caffeine and antioxidants, or maybe it’s **EGCG**, that special compound. Some drink it and find they’re not daydreaming about cookies or chips as much. It’s like green tea calms those cravings lurking in your brain.

Drinking it with meals might even help keep track of calories. Green tea doesn’t load you up with sugar or extra calories, unlike some fancy drinks. Over time, these small calorie savings add up big.

# Green Tea in Combination with Exercise and Diet

Here’s some real talk: green tea alone won’t solve everything. But when you sip it alongside exercise and eating healthy, things can really shift. Studies show people who pair green tea with workouts **burn more fat**, especially during cardio. It’s like the tea gives your body an extra nudge.

Adding green tea to a balanced life is easy, too. Start your day with a cup instead of juice. Or drink it 30 minutes before working out—it might give you a little energy boost. Some folks even turn it into a smoothie or use it to replace heavier drinks.

Ever heard of “green tea meal plans”? They’re a thing. Some people drink it with small, clean meals throughout the day as a natural way to keep energy stable and cravings low. Just imagine sipping something warm while sticking to your healthy eating goals. Helps, doesn’t it?

# Green Tea vs. Other Weight Loss Solutions

So, let’s compare. Green tea’s simple. It’s not a flashy supplement with ingredients you can’t pronounce. Unlike some dietary pills that promise quick fixes and leave you feeling gross, green tea works gently. And herbal teas? Sure, they have benefits, but not all of them contain **fat-burning compounds** like caffeine or EGCG.

What about other remedies? They often focus just on weight loss, but green tea offers extras—better focus, stable energy, and antioxidants to protect your body. You’re not just thinning out; you're feeling more alive. That’s why green tea wins—it’s natural, effective, and doesn’t leave you second-guessing it later.

So, does green tea help with weight loss? **Yes!** And it’s got perks no other solution can match.

# Potential Side Effects and Precautions

Green tea might be helpful, but it’s not perfect for everyone. Drinking too much can mess with your body. Some people feel jittery because of the caffeine—like when you’ve had one too many cups of coffee. Nobody wants extra anxiety or trouble sleeping, right?

There’s more. Drinking large amounts can mess with your stomach. Some people report nausea or a weird burning sensation, especially if they drink it on an empty belly. And for people with sensitive tummies, it’s a good idea to start with smaller amounts.

**How much is too much?** Experts say stick to about 3-5 cups a day. It's the sweet spot—enough to get the benefits without overloading on caffeine or causing problems. Oh, and pregnant or breastfeeding moms should be extra careful. Always better to ask a doctor before drinking too much.

# Success Stories and Testimonials

When Jen traded sugary drinks for green tea, she started noticing changes. ""It wasn’t about the weight loss at first,"" she said. But after three weeks, her clothes felt looser. The energy she got from green tea kept her going during workouts, and her cravings weren’t as bad either.

Then there’s Marcus. He added green tea to his dinner routine. Instead of snacking late at night, he’d reach for a warm cup. ""I didn’t feel like I was depriving myself,"" he said. Small changes like this helped him lose 10 pounds in two months without crazy diets.

We’re not saying the tea did all the work—but for folks like Jen and Marcus, it became part of their weight loss routines. Real people using a time-tested drink—it doesn’t get more inspiring than that.

# Conclusion

Green tea isn’t just another trend—it’s been here for centuries, helping people feel better inside and out. From metabolism support to appetite control, green tea’s real benefits shine through. The caffeine, antioxidants, and fat-burning properties all work together like a team.

Wondering **if green tea helps with weight loss**? The answer’s pretty clear—it can become a strong ally in your journey. Whether it’s replacing sugary drinks, supporting workouts, or calming cravings, this simple drink gives a lot for such a small effort.

So, grab a cup. Give it a try. Make it part of your day. Green tea might just be the small change that leads to something bigger. Who knows? Your weight-loss story could be next. ***You’ve got this.***",1,1733154556.0,u_subashbusiness95,0,1.0,False

My energy was tanked, my focus was scattered, and my blood sugar levels were all over the place. I was stuck in a cycle of exhaustion, unable to break free from the grip of unhealthy cravings. I knew I needed a lifeline, something natural, something that worked—not just another empty promise.

That’s when everything shifted.  
  
I was skeptical at first, of course. Who wouldn’t be? I had tried countless supplements in the past, each claiming to be “the one” to stabilize my blood sugar, crush cravings, and restore my energy. But this was different. Something about the way it was explained resonated with me. It wasn’t just the science behind it, though that was impressive—it was how simple it seemed to incorporate into my life.  
  
So, I gave it a shot. What did I have to lose?  
  
The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, coffee-overload kind of energy, but a steady, focused boost that carried me through my day. I no longer felt like I was chasing a fleeting high that always came crashing down. This felt...sustainable.  
  
Then came the real kicker: my cravings started to vanish. You know that mid-afternoon slump when your brain screams for something sugary to keep going? Gone. It was like my body finally figured out how to function without demanding I feed it junk. And for the first time in what felt like forever, I felt in control.  
  
The results didn’t stop there. Over the next few weeks, my blood sugar levels began to normalize. My doctor couldn’t believe the numbers, and honestly, neither could I. The fog that had been clouding my mind lifted. I could focus on my work, my family, and my goals without feeling like I was constantly running on empty.  
  
What really blew me away was how effortless it all felt. No complicated diets. No grueling workout routines. Just consistency. A single, small habit added to my daily routine made all the difference.  
  
I’d be lying if I said this transformation didn’t ripple into every area of my life. With more energy and mental clarity, I started to show up better in my relationships. I became more present, more engaged, more alive. My confidence skyrocketed, and I felt like I had regained a part of myself that I thought was gone for good.  
  
It’s hard to put into words just how much this has impacted me, but let me say this: I went from surviving to thriving. My days no longer feel like a slog; they’re filled with purpose, vitality, and freedom from the chains of erratic blood sugar swings.  
  
If you’re feeling stuck like I was, let this be your sign. There’s hope. You don’t have to settle for feeling less than your best. Take the leap, because you deserve to feel amazing. It worked for me, and I know it can work for you too.  
  
Trust me, you’ll thank yourself for it.",1,1733153567.0,SeniorsUnite,0,1.0,False
1h4xlwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1h4xlwq/i_believe_my_ex_has_bpd_but_not_sure/,"I believe my ex has BPD, but not sure","I (36M) started dating my ex-FA (35F) for three months in late 2022 which ended in late February of 2023.

The relationship moved steadily, and we would hang one night a week during the first two months. Date nights were fun and intimate, and we started to become physical after the three-week mark. Our values and vision for the future aligned and I felt I had met my person.

She told me she felt safe and secure and started asking for more time with me. She invited me to meet her brother and sister-in-law, and everything felt cozy and natural. She was very texty and present when we would spend time together.

The next week was her birthday, and she invited me to her parents' house to celebrate (she lived with them). During the invite, she trauma dumped about her abusive ex who she had filed a restraining order against which was unexpected, but I supported her through it. She also stated that, in relationships, she would tend to ""become who she wanted her partners to be"". I told her that, with me, that I wanted her to be ""her"" and that the past is the past and we can focus on having a beautiful future together.

The party went great, her family loved me, and all felt right in the world. The next morning, however, she ended the relationship via text, became cold and distant, and gave me no closure (not even a phone call). I was devastated and chased for a few weeks which resulted in heated exchanges. She re-wrote history and said that I was ""narcissistic"" and ""didn't listen to her."" Further, she said that it was strange that I found her attractive because of how ""sickly she was"" at the time, that she ""hated surprises yet I surprised her with dinners which meant I didn't care about her"", and that she, after each of our hang outs, would ""swear that it would be the last time"". The last text I received from her was, from memory, ""Ewww, how could I have ever even considered going out with you? \*\*\*\* you, <my name>. Blocked and forgotten"".

Anyway, nearly two years later, we ran into each other, and she text me after. She said she hadn't dated since me so she could ""get her life in order"" and wasn't planning until dating until she healed from a scheduled surgery in January. She invited me to a coffee, and I agreed under the pretense of it being a ""friendly catch up.""

We caught up and didn't get too deep or anything, but it was nice. Afterward, she started to become flirtier and more suggestive of romance. She invited me out to ice-cream a week later and we were touchier and flirtier and made out in the parking lot. She then asked me out to a hike a few weeks later, and we agreed to continue forward. During this time, met with my therapist for guidance as my curiosity was slowly being replaced by concern that the same situation was unfolding that devastated me once before. He encouraged me to address the past with her, as soon as possible, before proceeding forward.

A few days after my meeting with my therapist (and a few days before the hike), I was in her area, and we agreed to grab dinner. We spoke about the past (I brought it up, per conversations with my therapist) and we addressed what happened the first time. She stated she was ""so lost"" back then and apologized for hurting me. She said she could only give me pieces of her and if she gave anything else that she ""would have shattered"". She said she needed time with her family and away from relationships in order to heal, understand why she chose toxic partners, and get her life in order and that we were ""right people, wrong time"". I also apologized for any hurt during my post-breakup chasing. We agreed that we were both at a better place. She then invited me to Thanksgiving at her parents' which I accepted.

On Sunday we hiked together which went great. We grabbed dinner after, and she was vulnerable again and stated that her surgery was a partial-hysterectomy and that she would not be able to conceive children. I supported her and told her it wasn't a deal-breaker for me (truly, it would have been if I had known before developing feelings for her again). She talked openly with me, and we revisited our prior conversation about the past and what we needed to do to avoid what happened the first time.

We spoke more about the future and expectations of how to do better. She was very transparent and forthcoming. She then asked if we could be exclusive again, to which I agreed (\*internally hesitant, I might add). She committed to being ""open, honest, present, and communicative - always"" with me. We then agreed to have a movie night the Sunday after Thanksgiving.

Thanksgiving went great and it was a lot of fun seeing her family. The Deja-vu anxiety was creeping in, however. After, we hugged and kissed in her driveway and I drove home, praying that things would be different.

The next morning, she text and all was well. Phew. Texting continued throughout the day, and I felt a bit more relaxed. She was chatty and inquisitive, and I truly felt that we were re-writing history. On Saturday, however, she ended things via text in the same fashion as before, even making note of how ""this will feel like Deja-vu."" She also said that she was going to ""step away from her phone to give the situation some space"".

The reasons? She made a ""promise to herself"" not to date someone again who had ""hurt her in the past"" and that she didn't feel we were compatible for a slew of nit-picked random reasons, one of which being a flirty meme I sent in response to her own flirty meme post-Thanksgiving. My meme was of Tom Cruise stating, ""you complete me"". Though she ""love reacted"" to the message and gushed after receiving it at the time, she stated that she doesn't want ""to complete someone"" and that she wants a relationship where we ""amplify each other's lives"".

She also said that someone else having expectations of her was overwhelming to the point of her losing sleep and being emotionally drained. Though she pushed for our initial hangouts, a relationship label, and Thanksgiving, etc., she said that she also ""promised herself"" not to date until after her surgery and the thought of being in a relationship with me ""after the past we've had"" felt wrong and that, although we both may have changed, the timing ""still didn't feel right"" and that we should ""close the book for good"".

I asked for a phone call, bringing up our promise to be open, honest, and communicative, and she said she *was* respecting that promise by sending the break-up text. She also said that ""we're not having a phone call. I never promised one, and I don't want to."" The exact same reaction she had nearly two years prior. When I said we could work through this by communicating, and that we had an opportunity to do things differently this time by remaining committed to what we agreed to by entering a relationship together and that most of what she stated were based on assumptions without my input and not facts, she said, ""Why would I want to talk to someone else when it's a personal decision not to be in a relationship?""

Once I saw the fangs coming out again, I knew I had to back down and behave as securely as possible with respect to myself and the growth I had made since our first go-around. Rather than going back and forth as I did before, I sent a final text, which was:

""The meme I sent was just that - a meme. I sent it to be funny and flirty as we usually were after hanging out. I don't want someone to complete me. I want to amplify their life and for me to amplify theirs, as you said. I didn't want ""picture perfect"". I wanted you.

Had you raised your fears and concerns with me earlier and granted me a voice so we could collaborate, we could have worked through this. A unilateral disregard of our commitment to one another, after inviting me into your home and welcoming a relationship with me, is not simply a personal decision; it is a breach of trust and integrity with respect to what you had told me when we had our dinners together.

However, I do respect your sovereignty over your life and decision. Thank you so much for dinner and the hike and everything. That was very kind of you, and I enjoyed our time together. Best wishes, <name>.

With care, <my name>""

She simply responded with, ""Thank you. Best wishes <my name>."" And that was that.

I'm not entirely sure if it's BPD or fearful avoidant attachment or what. I'm doing better this time around - something about the re-affirmation of the behavior confirming how it has nothing to do with me I suppose. Is this typical of a BPD situation?",0,1733153545.0,BPDlovedones,0,0.5,False

Managed to turn some options plays (stuff like TSLA, AAPL, DJT etc.) into what I got rn - And smaller stocks was what allowed me that. Wins on stuff like $DRUG, $NUZE, $CHSN and more recently $SMCI and $ZENA took me to the top. What a ride! 

Why am I posting this you're wondering. Well, this has been a roller coaster of emotions and I feel like keeping it up could be some type of greedy/ungrateful move so I'm really considering quitting trading.

Hi it's nice to meet you! Hope you're all having a lovely morning and day :) I don't want to be a scrooge this year and really would like something special. So!

Here is a little about me
_______________________

- I love coffee and espresso. I have 3 or 4 machines (if you count a moka pot) and I love making morning drinks, sometimes mid day and night time drinks if I'm off work the next day. I know, so rebellious.

- Music is in my blood lol, right now my Playlist is full of Conan Gray, Ed Sheeran, Anson Seabra, BoyWithUke, Eden, Blackbear, Lewis Capaldi.. and so many others. 

- A big old PC gamer. My main games are League, WoW, Terraria, Binding of Isaac with friends, Valheim and uh.. There's others but I can't remember them lol I'm sorry.

- Can be a pretty Energetic and outgoing person. Sometimes I'm lazy and just want to relax at home after work. But I try my best to keep up with close friends and talk to them often. Very affectionate and caring, I want the best for my loved ones and my love runs deep if you can get it from me :) 

That's all from me! Thank you if you read, please give me a small intro and I'll respond as quickly as possible. Take care :)",2,1733153218.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Gretchen stands in her kitchen, holding a steaming mug of coffee in one hand while scrolling through her phone with the other. She's dressed in a simple white tank top and faded denim cutoffs, her bare feet pretty on the hardwood floor. Her hair is tousled from sleep, falling in soft waves around her face. She takes a sip of her coffee, closing her eyes briefly to savor the taste. Behind her, the morning sun streams in through the window, illuminating the countertop strewn with half-eaten fruit and crumpled napkins from breakfast.

1h4xefj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokenWallStreet/comments/1h4xefj/patience_is_key_kendu_inu_is_here_for_the_longterm/,"Patience is Key, Kendu Inu is here for the long-term.
","It's been said from the start, Kendu Inu was created to be a multi cycle project. The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable. Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels. Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar.

**Facts**

* We are the cusp of having 15K holders
* Kendu is almost 10 months old
* We rank top 10% in subreddit size
* We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed
* Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE)
* Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase)
* We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more.
* We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine
* Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu
* We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started
* We have the best organic community in the space, bar none
* A juicy fact about kendu, it's the only coin that is backed up with a campaign on okx (the second largest exchange ) [https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu](https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu)
* certik 50k votes done and is about to be audited
* Bitget is partnered with kendu recently

Why is all of this relevant? I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the ""bullrun"". Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market. Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive.

We are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase. Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun.

There is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends.

""You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have:  
\- Inspired people hustling daily  
\- 6+ months old  
\- Survived multiple large drops  
\- Holder Count growing every month  
\- $20 Billion+ Target  
\- Great Distribution + Diamondhands""

Kendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well.

Join the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like. Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.

I thought I was sore, went to the dr, surprise! Herpes.

Called and told him and he was super apologetic. I asked if he had it and he said it’s possible if he was asymptomatic. I was super nice about it - said it really could’ve been either of us, if we were both asymptomatic, I don’t blame you.

He later revealed that back in July he had a cold sore on his lip and the dr told him it was herpes. I asked if he felt any tingling the day we hooked up (he had a sore the next morning), and he started getting super apologetic.

Honestly, I feel for him. When I thought I may have given it to him I felt really bad, I feel like he  didn’t realize the danger. 

We’re both traveling for Thanksgiving so I haven’t seen him in person since this all went down. He’s been pretty distant on text which I’ve been sad about almost as much as my diagnosis. Would he really be less interested in me for something HE did to me?

He sent me a screenshot of his blood test results and it says he’s negative. I’m assuming it’s a false negative because he had sores. 

Getting coffee with him tomorrow (per my request). And I’m really anxious. I like him despite this and am scared he’s going to end things and maybe even take the blame away from himself, which I’m sure could be explained by some kind of subconscious psychological need to view himself in a positive light. Too much cognitive dissonance.

I work in tech and I've never seen a market so bad.  Certain recruitment firms are starting to bother me on how they do business.  What is the point of contacting me about a role - they clearly do not understand the tech/role.  They clearly do not understand my resume - in MANY cases I can tell they haven't even read it.  Making things worse, they want ""confirmation"" on salary and details like relocation, etc.  What is the point of this if the firm they are recruiting for hasn't even looked at my resume.  Often, I will give a verbal ok to what they are saying.  To me this should signal I am willing to talk to them.  Why the hell can't we have a casual conversation with someone at the hiring company?  30 minutes max.  At least show them my resume. I have worked for one of the biggest names in tech (not that it makes something a fit).  If they are interested, they will say it.  

Some of these recruiters take it further.  They want copies of my driver's license.  They want changes to the resume.  The want all this work, then they ghost.

1h4x9ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1h4x9ji/thanksgiving_trip_report_with_timestamps_detailed/,Thanksgiving Trip Report with Timestamps (detailed),"My parents (late 60s) and my wife and I (early 30s) visited WDW over Thanksgiving week. We decided to go 3 weeks ago so it was a last minute trip. 

We had been to WDW several times as a family; my most recent trip was in 2022 but my parents had been earlier this fall (they are pass holders). 

My mom planned many aspects of the trip but I helped with daily itineraries. We stayed in Port Orleans French Quarter from Tuesday to Thursday (3 nights). We flew in late Tuesday after work. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday were park days with our return flight scheduled for Friday evening. 

Our priority was doing as many rides as possible. I know that's not for everyone, but that's how we like to do it. For me, I enjoy thrill rides and definitely wanted to prioritize those. 

Overall impression: it was much less busy than I anticipated and incredibly fun! I have visited WDW at Christmas and these crowds were not comparable at all. It was definitely still busy, but totally manageable. 

I took notes on everything we did and had fun comparing posted wait times to actual wait times. Maybe this could be helpful if you’re planning a trip around a holiday. Our itinerary for each day is below. With some luck (and Lightning Lanes) we managed to ride every ride we wanted to ride. 

Also I am vegan so I’ll mark the plant based food I ate below. 



**Wednesday, November 27 - Magic Kingdom and Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party** 



Even though it was probably unnecessary, we decided to do MK all day plus the Christmas Party to maximize time in MK with lower crowds. Especially in the morning, crowds were SO low - much lower than expected for the day before Thanksgiving. It got a little busier in the afternoon but thinned out again during the party. 

We did 18 attractions in 12 hours, but we still took plenty of time to eat, shop, look at things, etc. We were definitely moving with a purpose but we were not constantly rushing from ride to ride. We also had a loose goal of trying to do a couple things we normally don't do, and managed to cross a few new things off our list. 

LL reservations at start of day: Mad Tea Party, Tiana’s Bayou Adventure, Haunted Mansion, Tron (single pass)

* 7:19 - In rope drop line (early entry) 
* 7:30 - Seven Dwarfs Mine Train - posted wait was 45 minutes, actual wait was 18 minutes (!)
* 7:56 - Peter Pan’s Flight - posted wait was 30 minutes, actual wait was 20 minutes 
   * I had not ridden this since I was a toddler, and it was very charming - wouldn't wait 60+ minutes for it though!
* 8:30 - Mad Tea Party (LL) - walked on 
* Booked our Space Mountain LL after tapping into Tea Party
* Coffee break 
* 9:02 - Big Thunder - posted wait was 5 minutes but went up to 20 after we got in line, actual wait was 14 minutes
* 9:30 - Country Bears Jamboree - walked on
   * We used to do this every time, but after the update, I don't think we will return... I loved how deranged it used to be :(
* 10:08 - Haunted Mansion (LL) - 3 minute wait 
* 10:30 - Lunch at Casey’s Corner (plant based Chicago style dog)
   * A random delightful moment: my dad, semi-joking, asked the piano player if he could play ""Blood on the Saddle"" (from the old Country Bears) and the piano player played an abridged version of the *entire* old Country Bears soundtrack - it was amazing 
* 11:24 - Monsters Inc. Laugh Floor - walked on
* 11:56 - Space Mountain (LL) - 7 minute wait 
* 12:19 - Carousel of Progress - walked on
* 1:05 - Tron Lightcycle / Run (LL Single Pass) - forgot to time the queue, maybe waited 5 minutes
   * This was SO FUN - despite the short length, I had an absolute blast and loved it  
* 1:38 - Mickey’s PhilharMagic - walked on
* 2:05 - rode the Railroad to Frontierland
   * Had not done this since I was a toddler, it was a good way to break up the afternoon and have a sit down
* 2:30 - Tiana’s Bayou Adventure (LL - it had been down earlier in the day so we had an experience redemption) - forgot to time the queue, maybe waited 5 minutes 
   * I hadn't ridden this since the update, and I thought it was really sweet and fun. I do think the ride could use more suspense but loved all the bayou theming and music 
* 3:20 - Liberty Square Riverboat - walked on
   * I had not done this since I was a toddler. We rode it because it's going away and it was kind of miserable - it was hot, smelly, and took forever... 
* 4:00 - took the monorail to the Polynesian for drinks and snacks at Trader Sam’s Terrace (rainbow sushi roll & tofu lettuce cups)
* 6:30 - returned to MK for Xmas party
* 6:54 - Jingle Cruise - posted wait was 35 minutes (cast member told us 50), actual wait was 25 minutes
* 7:33 - Pirates of the Caribbean -  posted wait was 5 minutes, actual wait 5 minutes
* 8:01 - Small World - posted wait 5 minutes, actual 3
* 8:25 - The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - posted wait 10 minutes, actual 9
   * Had not done this since I was a toddler (and felt a bit funny being a 31-year-old on this ride) but it was very sweet :)
* Snack break (plant based whoopie pie)
* 9:06 - Tron - posted standby wait was 45 minutes, we were at the lockers after 20 minutes - I think we waited about 30 minutes total 
* 10:00 - Fireworks!
* 10:19 - In line for bus to resort 



**Thursday, November 28 - Epcot** 



Much more relaxed day! With MultiPass, I honestly don’t think we needed to rope drop at all. Or we could have decided not to get MultiPass and rope dropped Ratatouille and been able to manage everything else. But it was nice to have the flexibility with MultiPass. 

LL reservations at start of day: Living with the Land, Ratatouille, Spaceship Earth, Guardians of the Galaxy (LL single pass) 



* 8:35 - entered park (early entry) 
* 8:41 - Soarin’ - posted wait was 10 minutes but my mom wanted to wait to be seated in row B1 (she politely asked the cast member) so we waited about 20 minutes 
* 9:14 - Living with the Land - walked on
* Coffee & pretzel break 
* 10:25 - Guardians (LL Single Pass) - forgot to keep time but maybe waited 5 minutes  
* 10:52 - Spaceship Earth (LL) - walk on
* 11:30 - Drinks and chips at La Cava (had to wait a little bit for a table)
* 1:00 - wanted to try to ride Guardians again so we refreshed the app right at 1:00 and got a Virtual Queue boarding group 119
* Backtracked World Showcase toward France 
* 1:42 - Ratatouille (LL) - waited 15 mins 
* Shopping around World Showcase
   * This part of the day felt like a slog. In retrospect, I think we should have left Epcot in the afternoon and taken a break. It was hot and crowded, and since we've been to Epcot many times before, I didn't feel like we really needed to spend 3 hours walking around World Showcase
* 5:15 - Dinner reservation at Biergarten in Germany (they labeled plant based offerings in the buffet and our server brought us veggie sausages)
* 6:54 - Walked through Moana’s Journey of Water 
* 7:06 - Living with the Land (LL) - walked on 
* 7:37 - Guardians of the Galaxy VQ - waited 90 minutes (ride was having technical difficulties), on ride vehicle 9:07
   * This was a slog, but so worth it to ride Guardians twice in one day! Our songs were ""I Ran (So Far Away)"" and ""September""



**Friday, November 29 - Hollywood Studios (travel day)** 



We checked out and dropped off our stuff at the front desk at our hotel. We knew we would have to be leaving the park at 1:30pm to make it to our evening flight on time, so we rope dropped in order to make the most of our time in the park. Early entry and LLMP felt very crucial to getting everything done here in a time crunch. 

LL reservations at the start of the day: Toy Story Mania, Tower of Terror, Slinky Dog, Rise of the Resistance (LL single pass)

We had planned to rope drop Rock ‘n’ Rollercoaster, but Rise and RnRC were down upon park open, so we rope dropped Runaway Railway. 



* 8:16 - got in line for Runaway Railway - waited 24 minutes 
* 8:51 - Toy Story Mania (decided to wait in standby line because the wait was low and our LL wasn’t until the afternoon) - posted wait was 5 minutes when we entered queue but then shot up to 40 - we waited 15 minutes
* Coffee & bagel break 
* 10:13 - Tower of Terror (LL) - walked on
   * This is one of my favorite rides in all of WDW. I hope they never re-theme it from the Twilight Zone!
* While in line for ToT, RnRC opened! We hurried over there after ToT and arrived right as they opened the single rider line - I think only 2 people were ahead of us - the timing couldn't have been better
* 10:33 - Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster - single rider line, waited 12 mins (standby wait time was about 60 minutes - maybe more?)
* 11:00 - Brunch at Ronto Roasters (triple suns breakfast wrap was SO GOOD)
* 11:26 - Muppet Vision 3D - walked on 
   * In the past I used MV as a nap opportunity but since it's going away, I was determined to be awake, and I loved it - actually really sad now that it's going away :(
* After Muppet Vision, I checked the app and saw Rise was open! We rushed over there and were able to use an experience redemption (because it was down during our LL reservation window) to join the lightning lane... which was crucial, because the standby wait jumped up to 3.5 hours
* 11:56 - Rise of the Resistance (LL single pass) - 12 minutes wait until the pre-show
   * My (maybe) hot take is that while I love how immersive the pre-show and ride are, the actual ride itself is only a bit more thrilling than Runaway Railway. I remembered it being more of a thrill!
* 12:40 - Slinky Dog Dash (LL) - waited 5 minutes 
* Rode the bus back to our hotel, had a quick beignet snack (plant based beignets available upon request at Scat Cat’s), then headed to the airport around 2:15

I have a Lagom P64 with HU burrs and a LMLM. For the better part of a year I've been experiencing a rather annoying issue and I cannot figure it out for the life of me. I typically make 2 espressos in the morning, and have huge consistency issues. I'll quickly go over my workflow then provide some examples of what I'm talking about. I weigh out 19g of beans (stored in Airscape container), RDT with two sprays, give the cup a shake and put it into the grinder. I WDT, tap on the counter once, then tamp with Normcore. Now the problem is when doing this just minutes apart from my first shot, the results are worldly different. Even across multiple days without changing anything. For instance, this morning I pulled a shot 19g in 41 out in 22s, without changing anything, i pulled another 20 minutes later and it went 38g out in 31s! I know taste is the big decider, but that's the thing. The two shots were completely different. Every time I try to compensate for the first shot running too fast or too slow, I end up overshooting and I basically have to end up with bad coffee every morning. I never had this problem with my previous machine and grinder. I don't know what's happening and I desperately need help. TIA",2,1733152566.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

How fast time goes by, I blinked and 5 years was gone and I remember little about it. Alcoholism is a time warp to an older age. 

2. Having withdraw symptoms at family functions. Then noticeably drinking more than anyone else. 

3. Morning withdraws. Shaking, sweating, and only feeling better by sneaking a drink at 6am is no way to live. I ran out of alcohol in my stash at a few years ago and had to go to the ER because I had no access to alcohol. 

4. Being out of shape. I was so bad I could not pick something off the floor with out feeling faint. My first day back to exercising was me walking on the stairs 2 times in a row 3 times a day. My last day being drunk I bought a blood oxygen meter and it was 92 after walking up the stairs. Now I can bench 85lb dumbbells for 4 sets of 8, slight incline. 

5. My career going to hell. Prior to being an alcoholic I was a great banker. Always at the top 10% and was being promoted constantly. My last year end review was does not meets and if I don’t turn around this year I will be let go. 

6. The damage it does to your GI system. I was bloated and going to the bathroom 4 or 5 times a day and it lead to a painful condition. My last 3 months I was so bloated I could not put socks on or tie my shoes. It would hurt so bad to bend over that it made me see stars. 

7. Hiding my breath. I would have early morning work functions that I needed to function for so I would drink 3 drinks before hand. I would drink black coffee to try and mask it. I would brush my teeth and use breath strips. I know a few people caught on. 

8. Empty can/bottle management. I would have empty cans in my car, lap top bag, through the house and I had to manage where they were and dispose of them. Every lunch I would drink in my car and put empty beer cans (and piss bottles) in my laptop bag and would have to dispose of them secretly. 

9. Secretly opening new beers so my wife would not notice. I would open a new can at the same time I slammed the fridge closed. I would burry the can under blanks to silence the opening. I would be warming up the grill for 30 minutes slamming beers. 

10. The little things. Going to bed sober and waking up rested. Watching a movie with my wife and not thinking about how to get more alcohol. Going anywhere and not planning how I am going to drink. Road trips and not worrying about alcohol. Sitting in my office sober. Being at meeting sober. Being able to walk down the street to get coffee. Going into a gas station and not buying beer. Cooking sober. Eating out and not spending $40 on alcohol. Enjoying hobbies. Enjoying walks. Enjoying the outdoors. And my favorite thing, all of the noise is gone from my head, I’m not rushing to cover up what alcoholic me did or did not do. ",41,1733152461.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False

For a couple of years, him and I shared a friendship that began  with the purity of simple, shallow, and untainted affection.
Yet the day we met for coffee was the day everything changed for me.
I was momentarily rendered speechless by his striking looks, effortless grace, and innate charm.
His beauty was almost sacred, and I -weak in the face of it-felt a forbidden temptation bloom within me.
I knew of his fiancée, his college sweetheart, and so I sought to bury my thoughts, to smother them as one would extinguish a flame, frantic and anxious.
But he was magnetic, and I was powerless.

Our conversations ebbed and flowed, like the tide. Life pulled us apart, and then, as if by providence-or some cruel design-brought us back together.
By April, while I was out of town, a continent away, our words grew fonder, taking on an intimacy I had once avoided for fear of losing what I had cherished as a great friendship.
The lines blurred, and in our weakness, we crossed them. We gave in to a desire neither of us should have succumbed to.
It was a sin both intoxicating and damning, leaving me torn between ecstasy and guilt.

He confided in me about his doubts, the fractures in his love for her, and the possibility of ending it once and for all.
I played the confessor, urging him to remain faithful to the vows he had made, though my heart-treacherous and unfaithful to its better judgment- whispered that he should break them. I longed for him to choose me, though I disguised my selfishness as counsel, hiding behind the mask of virtue.

Months passed, and as his wedding approached, he shared with me the details of his plans.
Each word felt like a quiet betrayal, each utterance a dagger wrapped in velvet, and I clung to the fragile hope that it would all fall apart, that some act of divine intervention might spare me the heartbreak I had feared.
But today, the truth arrived, unyielding and unmerciful.
I saw the wedding photos.

She, radiant as a saint in her bridal glory.
He, breathtaking, like a fallen angel cloaked in light.
And I, cast into the shadows, shattered and condemned by my own desires.

I wrote my congratulations, a short, restrained message, carefully composed to resemble my usual bubbly self, but still so empty.
I couldn't allow the veil to drop, revealing the weight of my unspoken grief against the sharp contrast of his joy. I couldn't take that from him.

Since that moment, time has slowed to a crawl, each hour heavy with grief and guilt.
I know I have no right to this pain-it is my penance, my cross to bear--but it clings to me all the same, an unrelenting specter of what could never be.

I bought a used pc a few weeks ago, to finally upgrade my old one. But I think it is a lot slower than it should be. Like just doing a right click on the desktop, sometimes it takes like 2 seconds to bring it up, same when right click on a file or folder. Windows interface is laggy and unresponsive too, browser too. Its not always like this, now it feels snappy and good, but it happens frequently.   
Boot is everytime slow, takes a while until the windows lock screen comes up. Then writing in my pass is horrible too, it takes seconds to switch there and when writing in my pass it just shows up like 1 or 2 seconds later. And when windows loads up it still needs some time to come alive so I can do anything. Even if I go get some drink or coffee, so it even has time to sit on the lock screen.  
Its a completely fresh install. Only automatically starting program is Steam. Win updates are already finished.  
It has M2 SSD, Ryzen 7 3700x, RTX 3 series, and yet in Windows it almost performs like my old pc with HDD and 4th gen Intel i5....

I thought maybe the age gap would be weird but that might just be because it's the biggest I've encountered while dating. We've both indicated attraction towards one another, and have some common interests/hobbies. For added context, her profile says ""Figuring out my dating goals"", whereas mine says ""Long Term, Open to Short"". I've dated someone before who had the same in their bio, and in that case I got the sense they were interested in more long term dating but also weren't rushing into anything. But obviously that's just one example.

After a few days of talking I asked if she'd want to get coffee sometime. She said she'd love to, but that her life was in disarray (her wording) so she'd ""definitely"" have to let me know when. She closed her response with ""but I am very much interested"".

Normally this would make me take pause and wonder if they're actually interested, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt because she emphasized her interest. And she did mention prior that work had been crazy. The one thing that sticks out is before I asked her out, she did say she didn't have much fun things planned for the weekend really.

Anyways, we've continued talking since then, and she's been pretty decent at keeping the conversation going. Last night I was telling her about my Christmas tree and I told her I'd send her a photo if I could, and she responded by offering me her number so we could text. She said I've been very respectful so she didn't see an issue with it.

hi everyone, i have no way of knowing if i have CPTSD or any trauma, so i wanted to share some things i’ve been dealing with and ask if anyone here has experienced similar things and if so how they knew they have trauma. i have absolutely NO memories of any sexual abuse so i really don’t want to act like i have sexual trauma but i can’t shake the feeling that i do. i never thought anything like that had happened to me until a few months ago i had an experience that ever since i have noticed other things and been unable to stop thinking about and trying to remember if anything happened to me as a child. 

this sounds ridiculous but it started a few months ago when i got a coffee from this chain café that was german chocolate cake flavored, and for some reason one of the syrups in it tasted so FOUL to me and everyone else liked it and said it was fine. but it didn’t just taste /gross/ it specifically made me feel like /something/ was being shoved down my throat. i had a full body reaction and a distinct feeling that it tasted like something else i had tasted before and hated, but i could NOT figure out what. i kept trying it to figure out what the flavor was and i couldn’t, but i found myself actually almost crying and i felt so scared for no reason. i have no idea why i would take something tasting gross and automatically think sexual abuse, but i instinctively felt like it was a memory of something having to do with that. since then, i have been noticing myself reacting to other things like they’re triggering even though i have no trauma. i also keep thinking about things about myself or my childhood that make me question it. like i have always been hyper sexual and (very unfortunately) seem to have cnc and ddlg kinks….which i feel terrible about but always get aroused by seeing things like that in media or porn. after getting off to them or many times while i’m trying to i also suddenly just start crying and feel hurt. i also have a specific memory from when i was about 8 when my camp counselor was telling me a story about her teen pregnancy and said that she was “abused in a way no girl should ever be abused” and i wanted to tell her “i know what r*pe is” but i didn’t because i knew the at i wasn’t supposed to know. and i don’t know how i knew that word or what that was at that age because i really can’t think of a way i would have known.

but i really can’t remember any abuse or even a scenario where i could have been abused, my parents were pretty careful and i wasn’t even allowed to go to sleepovers until after 3rd grade. the ONLY circumstances where there was any possibility of it that i can remember are that my pediatrician growing up was also our neighbor and family friend, so when my mom was in labor with one or two of my siblings he came over to watch my and my brother and i almost remember him being in the bed with us?? but i don’t think so. i also had many babysitters for like 6-8 hours a day when i was really young and i think my mom mentioned that there was one or two male babysitters. but i really don’t remember any male babysitters at all and i don’t feel like my doctor did anything to me. 

basically, and i apologize that this post is so long, i wanted to ask you all if you have any similar experiences and also if you do have repressed memories how you realized that you were abused? also if this post is offensive to any of you survivors i deeply apologize ",0,1733151937.0,CPTSD,1,0.5,False

She even hung a wrinkled banner from the Merc without tagging and tied a pink bow around that sad brown wicker vase with dead brown flowers . The one positive we have seen is S& L asking if they could repost the sectional . I looked and S&L follows her . To gain real followers why in the world is she not decorating that front porch to the hilt .. with a GREEN striped S&L furniture .. and tagging them . It could be SO GOOD properly decorated and festive . WHY do you post picture of that massive pine piece with a dumb stool and basket on it , instead of Christmas decor / garland over by the other window and doors so sectional is featured ? Get a big S&L round table or ottoman for in front of it .. STYLE it . Then tag ! S&L is featuring a brown check now .. see third picture . That’s how you get featured, that’s how you grow your business. Ashley if you don’t have that skill .. GET HELP .. a few Amazon trees can go a long ways . Decorate up that porch bright and fun with a tree  .. in media room same thing . Feature that S&L and post and tag .  Her whole situation is just sad and brown now . The Merc is all brown stuff , nothing festive , her house a mismatch of what looks like good will , hand me down furniture .. first house of 20 year old vibes . She is so unhappy in the “ inbetween” .. she is stuck in 2016 while the rest of us have moved on . Everyday , her morning talk and sell same ole stuff , go to Merc .. picture of coffee , at some point we see F in ratty clothing and/or kids laying around on a sofa .. or forced to dance around a beach. Paint the fireplace or hutch one more time ( this was the third time) . If the kids had activities there would be more content .. I just want to kick her out of that house and Merc for a couple weeks and make it all happy and make sense ! It’s all so sad at the moment . Spinning this less is more crap because of the hurricane is silly .. Ashley has never decorated .. ever . I see a very stubborn or depressed person in what is being posted .

1h4wreq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1h4wreq/need_helpsuggestion_to_plan_a_family_trip_from/,Need help/suggestion to plan a family trip from Dec 19 to Dec 27,"Just discovered this sub and hats off to all the active redditors here offering their insightful help! So, leaning on y'all to help me plan an upcoming trip.

We are a family of 4, 3 adults and a child (12) that love activities and exploring. We land in SJU at around noon on Dec 19 and leave from SJU on Dec 27 at 2PM. We have a car rental reservation via Avis for that duration. So, those are the bookends. Everything else is open.

There are some POIs and activities that we have identified based on reviews/research thus far.

1. Arecibo area - Cueva Ventana and Cueva del Indio. + Is it better to explore coffee plantations in Adjuntas/Utuado from Arecibo or elsewhere?
2. Fajardo / Luquillo - Cayó Icacos for Snorkeling + El Yunque - is there still a daily restriction on the number of cars that can enter? Is it better to travel with a tour group?
3. Old San Juan - the forts and old town + food scene?
4. Bio Bay and beaches on Vieques

So, first question, \[Q1\] Any that you might recommend to add based on above? For instance, we visited Spain last Christmas and Christmas Markets were a thing. Are there any interesting ones on the main island given the time of the year? 

At this time, the thought process is to initially base ourselves in Condado area and execute day trips from 19-24, and then be on Vieques from 24-27, and return to SJU on 27th and fly back home. However, looking at driving distances from Ceiba/Luqillo to Condado, Condado to Arecibo etc., basing in Condado seems challenging. Therefore, \[Q2\] if we are to split our stays, what is the best way to cover the above plan? We know we have to have min 2 stays, one on the main island and other on Vieques. What other options are ok to consider?

Car rental - given we need to rent again on Vieques, would like to avoid paying 2x. I read about parking at ferry terminal and taking the ferry over. That would still incur paying for rental car on main island for 2+ days when we likely want to be in Vieques. One way to avoid this would be to start our trip from Vieques or end in Vieques. As per moon rise and moon phase, looks like latter part of our trip would be better (darker evenings / nights) for Vieques. \[Q3\] Is there a way to, say, return an Avis Rental car in Ceiba area so we avoid paying for time we spend in Vieques? And as a follow-up to this, how easy is it to get to SJU on the morning of Dec 27 if we take a ferry from Vieques to Ciba and look for an Uber?

And finally, we are a mix of vegetarians / vegans and as such will need to factor that into planning. \[Q4\] Any must try foods or restautants? We made a list of popular veg/vegan friendly restaurants like Verde Mesa, Cafe Berlin etc., so wanting more input around avoid this, surely try that type insights. Are the catamaran tours from Fajardo to Cayó Icacos suitable for vegetarians given they include buffet options?

Before I close, please let me know if I am packing too much into the timeframe available. If so, \[Q5\] what would be must-do's based on the list above?

Edits based on learning from other recent posts (will continue to refresh here):  
1) No more reservations / limits on cars getting into El Yunque

2) Biobay experience is better on Vieques (vs Fajardo or La Parguera) + other awesome experiences there, so its a do-not-miss. ",1,1733151349.0,PuertoRicoTravel,0,1.0,False

Medyo nasurprised ko kay mas damo gid didto ya food carts sa Molo compared sa Jaro plaza. There were streetfoods there and coffee-in-cart nga wala ko nakita sa Jaro. 😅 And I realized nga daw kanami man didto gali magfood trip kag walking sa plaza, medyo crowded lang gid kung Sunday kay damo gid ya teens and bata gatambay & hampang didto plus gasilimba.

He would never leave me alone when I was in the kitchen, away from my bf. Then he'd share ""secrets"" with me, that started out with childhood trauma, to which I felt sympathy for, thus continuing to allow to keep his ""secrets."" Which turned into him sharing things about how he  would be outside my bathroom door to listen to me using the bathroom, or how he says he stares at my body whenever I""m around him, and that he wishes he could produce a lot of cum. I'd immediately tell him those things he's saying are not to be discussed with me. Once he started sharing these sexual secrets, I told my boyfriend everything. Realizing that up until the point of sharing those sexual secrets, he had been grooming me to play his game of ""keeping his secrets."" Even my bf thought the things I was telling him was unbelievable at first because the things I was now telling my bf seem so abstract that it sounds like I'm talking about a different person, someone my bf doesn't know to be his father.

So fast forward to now, years later my bf and I had to come back to live with his father in law. His father doesn't talk to me, never says good morning, never says bless you after I sneeze (he will if his son sneezes every time), never asks how I'm doing (even if tears are falling down my cheeks every three days), and sadly this is how my mom was treating me when I lived with her too.

The father in law is just a guy who had an injury on the job when he was in his mid twenties, and ever since then has been living on disability checks and watching movies for the next 30 years. It's pathetic to me, because even though I agree people with disabilities need assistance, his ""state of disability"" seems fictitious because of his ability to ride his bike to the food pantry, to the sketchy white van 2.5 miles away, and where ever else he goes. Every time he goes out, he over exerts him body, puts in in a cycle of pain, rehab, recovery. He has bad eating habits, tons of sugary drinks and complaining about his ""small appetite"" after smoking weed for breakfast with a huge cup of sugary coffee. basically an adult child creating his own ""sickness"" and when he falls ill, (every few days), my bf has to take care of him (because he's his caretaker). SO the health of this man could potentially be completely fine with a few mobility issues now and then but he's now like 60 something with no preventative care, spending every day full of dopamine from drugs to prostitutes to other forms of entertainment like tv/movies.

THE SITUATION:

My bf tells me, ""Hey my dad wants to share with us a horror movie, because the last movie he shared with us wasn't good he wanted to share a good one."" This other movie he shared was like a cheesy Halloween movie, with some sexual scenes that made my bf and I uncomfortable already. So I agree to watch this second movie with my bf. When we start watching it, his father is in the kitchen. Then when the beginning of the movie starts , the scene is about a group of guys going to visit a girl who just died, at the morgue (one of these guys works at the morgue.) Then the men start talking about how pretty she is, and then begin to r\*pe her one by one, meanwhile my bf's father came out of the kitchen during the beginning of this scene. His father is standing next to my bf, just staring at the scene straight without looking away. My bf is telling him to leave, but he is so entranced he doesn't and tells him no. Even though he said he would leave us alone to watch the movie. Not creeped out yet? Well I definitely was. I tried watching this movie, although triggering to me because of my own experiences, and then the scene changed from the girl being dead to being alive on the last guy who was r\*ping her. I found this part so disturbing I ran out of the living room, meanwhile my bf's father is continuing to stare at the scene.

I later tell my bf that that was a completely inappropriate movie to show me, and his own son. And why on Earth would he think that this would be a good idea? My bf defended his father by saying things like, ""He just wanted to give us a more thrilling movie since the last one he shared was bad."" Or when I complained that sharing this movie without any warning to me or my bf that there may be a triggering scene, my bf defended him by saying something like, ""No he doesn't have to. He didn't know it would trigger you."" Like what?? Me, being a female, seeing another female being r\*ped, how could I not be triggered???? Also my bf said something like, ""Do you think the girl in the movie should be hated for for doing this scene? Is she wrong to imitate r\*pe?"" Idk even know why that was asked,I was just completely disturbed, and had a panic attack afterwards because again of my own experiences. And also because of the context that his father has a history of being a creep to me, I am connecting the dots that he is just trying to fuck with me and get away with it because he's the ""poor old disabled man who doesn't know any better.""

1h4wj51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1h4wj51/a_cup_of_coffee/,A cup of coffee ,"F20 I’ve been going through it. It all started when my sister passed away from a seizure. It was a traumatic experience because she passed away in front of me she was panicking and telling me she was struggling to breathe and went into a seizure. I was 17 at the time. After that these 3 years has been a pain in the ass. Ok let me try to explain. After she passed away I haven’t slept properly ever. My mind is countinously restless and afraid. My heart rate is always high. And out of nowhere I had this phobia of caffeine because caffeine was the cause of my first panic attack ever. After 2 weeks she passed away I was in a state of shock and I drank a cup of coffee thinking nothing of it and then a little time later I thought I was about to die the caffeine induced a panic attack. Like I couldn’t breathe, I was shaking like crazy basically a panic attack.  That was my first panic attack and it was the most craziest panic attack ever because it gave me flashbacks of the way my sister passed away her panicking and struggling to breathe and that is how I developed my hypochondria. It got worse and worse because after she passed away my family and the people I know said I am a spitting image of my sister and that it looks like they are staring at a ghost. I got into this whole hysteria thinking that Im gonna die like my sister. I get like 5 panic attacks a week. And I am deathly afraid of anything caffeinated because I think I will die if I drink caffine. I got so scared of drinking caffine that I get scared to eat sometimes. I lost 15 pounds. This fucking shit is ruining my life because yesterday I was relaxing with my girlfriend watching rick and morty and eating my gyro chicken over rice and I drank my creme brulee boba and for some reason my mind was like this boba probably has caffeine and I got flash backs to my panic attack with coffee and I got into this whole panic attack. The worst case of a panic attack I have ever gotten. It was going on for 5 hours. My girlfriend was trying to calm me down telling me I am ok and that everything will be ok and I was still panicking. She opened up a window for me and I was still panicking. This shit was sooo scary yet embarrassing because she was witnessing me crashing out. I ran to the sink and I was throwing up and I put the faucet on to hot boiling water and I was putting my hand in the boiling water to help me from the panic and it was working…..she was so scared for me cuz my hands were turning red. I thought I was gonna die yesterday. But I am so grateful my girlfriend was there the whole time calming me down and reassuring me that I am healthy. That was the worst case of panic attack ever usually it goes on for 1 hour but yesterday it was going on for 5 damn hours. Every single day my apple watch tells me my heart rate is above 100 right now its 120. Im always scared I am alwags restless. I would never wish this on my worst enemy. Every single day I am terrified. And I went to therapy for 4 sessions I didn’t like talking to the lady because she wasn’t doing much she was awkward so I stopped going. I am scared to take medication what if I have to rely on it forever. should I take medication I don’t know what to do anymore Im crashing. All I know is that I am scared.

But away from that robot city, was a small hill, a place no one really goes to, even though it is drenched with green, it doesn’t invite anyone but me. I have always wondered why. On the top of the hill lies a small flower, it has been there as far as I can recall.

Often times, I have thought of plucking it to put an end to its suffering. I don’t know why I feel that, for it looks really beautiful and innocent, is it also why I like the hill. Those science people at my college think plants don’t suffer, my inner self can’t accept that. It reminds me of that girl I went to middleschool with.

It was a beautiful winter evening, when we got the news of her death. She was found on an empty park-ish field, the one the more privileged women of the society take their kids to. It had nothing in it but grass. No sort of ride for the kids, no good sight to see, empty for the better part of the day. She was found without a scratch to her body. There was nothing wrong with her body, it was just dead. Death seemed to have come as natural to her as possible. Her vitilgo-ed face looked as white as possible. It seemed like the suffering had ended. It felt like she gave up her body. It was like she found a revolutionary way to suicide, something worth giving noble prize for.

Her death generated more buzz than her life ever could have. There wasn’t particularly any mourning in the class, but an awkward silence. The silence lasted weeks, vanishing for a few hours, and being back again. The silence was seen more on teachers. Particularly more on those who had said stuffs about her. Although it was seen less on the students, who had said. It was more seen on me, as if I were a teacher, who had said. But my memory doesn’t recall me being so.

We all experienced it, the whole of 5-A. But it eventually ended. At times, it felt like it wouldn’t but it did. The same way, the harsh, seemingly unending, winter ended, along with it. The spring did come. Came a bit early for a few boys. Also did for the few extremely religious teachers. And eventually did for others. I guess it did for me too eventually. I might have been one of the last one in the winter but I did see the beauty that spring bought. Everything returned to normal. Harsh winters made us realise the beauty of spring. Spring isn’t as beautiful usually. It wasn’t before, it won’t be eventually. 
Death retuned to being ignored. We were not her parents, or friend. Guilt and unfamiliarity were our reasons, not love, certainly not. No one knew her enough to love her. Many would have, if they had. Or maybe not. 

I don’t feel any regret of whatever that happened. Regret is not made for the weak kid that I was. Some nights, I think of it all, those nights when I have nothing else to think about. And I can’t find the reason. For long, I assumed it was the same for all of us whom experienced. I was deeply wrong. Last year, I met a guy from the class on a random train back home. He had experienced but forgotten, something I didn’t assume as humanly possible. He mentioned about how great class 6th was. He talked a lot about other classes. On asking about class 5th, he said he doesn’t remember a thing that happened that year. Because not much happened that year. Our class won the most discipline class for that year. Reminds me of the famous Gamora-Thanos meme about losing everything in order to get something. I find it weird because she was more close to nothing than everything.

On my way back from the hill, there is a small coffee shop, ran by an old man. It is always empty. Empty enough to make people care about the old man’s wellbeing. I drink coffee every single time on my way back. I am not a coffee expert for sure, but the coffee is just it. It’s the best my tongue has ever experienced.

My diet consisted of fatty beef, chicken thighs with skin, chicken liver, pork steaks, eggs, (everything cooked, mostly in tallow, sometimes bacon and fat even tho I don’t eat bacon) 1 or 2 ounces of cheese 2 or 3x a week,  butter, and 1 tablespoon heavy cream in 1/2 cup decaf coffee 1x daily. 

I ate this way for 3 weeks then went on a family vacation fully intending to continue this WOE. Didn’t happen. After my vacation (2 wks later) I began this WOE again and have been on it for the past month. I lost 8 pounds in 10 days and started putting on muscle without even working out. (This makes me think I didn’t have enough protein in previous diet.) I couldn’t workout, as I was too weak from the weight loss and change in diet. 

A few days ago, I had routine blood work done. I got the results last night and must say it shook me up. I don’t go to the doctor often, but in the past, my cholesterol levels have always been normal. 
I’m a 56yoF 118lbs/53.5k, 5’2.5”/158.75cm tall, with low blood pressure, normal thyroid count, no diabetes, 22 BMI. I do light exercise (walking, biking, yoga off and on). 

Previous diet was mostly vegetarian- beans, vegetables, with a little chicken and fish. But I traveled a lot this year which required eating out most or all meals for two weeks at a time. Not good…
My health wasn’t optimal (pain in hands, hips, knees, back, extremely painful to walk on my feet-I figured it was nerve pain - felt like I was 80; I was always itchy and had electrical zingers in random muscles like fibromyalgia, exhausted all the time. Being on carnivore for almost a month took all of that away except the exhaustion. I also started sleeping through the night. 

Does anyone have any thoughts about my cholesterol levels and/or glucose level? (Tap photo to see glucose level at bottom.) Is this from my previous diet considering I’ve only been on this WOE for a month or is this a result of the carnivore diet? I’m trying to decide if I’m going to do this long-term or if I should shift to low carb eating with less animal fats, eggs, fatty meats…

1h4w6tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1h4w6tr/manuel_antonioquepos_november_2024_trip_update/,Manuel Antonio/Quepos November 2024 Trip Update,"Hi, I wanted to pass along a trip summary with tips after finding all of the prior posts helpful in planning my trip.  I've just finished an incredible 4 days in Manuel Antonio/Quepos area (end of November 2024). We are a couple in our late 30's who travel internationally multiple times a year.  We also live in Los Angeles, so the beach/pool time was less important to us on the trip than it may be for others, and prioritized nature/hiking/animals.  

The TLDR is: We absolutely loved this beautiful animal/nature filled area but having your own car is pretty crucial 

Renting a car: 

We are comfortable driving in foreign countries so we did a rent a car.  We drove from San Jose airport, and found it very easy/straightforward. The roads were in good conditions but we were here right after the big storms so there were a lot of potholes to avoid.  Every gas station we stopped at had nice clean bathrooms.   Be sure to stop at Tarcoles bridge to see the crocodiles.  We had heard stories about the car insurance but we had Am Ex provide the letter proving we had damage/collision insurance, which Avis did ask for.  We were able to get the insurance letter very easily via the ""claims portal"" on the am ex website.  The only coverage we accepted at Avis is the 3rd party liability insurance (which to my understanding is required by law).  This is not covered by most credit card rental car insurance.  In general, I would have found the area of Manuel Antonio difficult to get around without a car.  You would to either stay at your hotel for most meals and book tours for every excursion, which could really add up. Even without a tour, most waterfalls/nature areas in the area charge $20+ per person for entrance.   We drove to La Fortuna at the end of our trip.  It took about 5.5 hours (we took the route that took you up to the 1 to the 142 and around the lake).  Google was always try to send you on a shortcut - do not listen.  Even with a storm coming, we found the drive much easier than expected.  The last 90 minutes is pretty curvy but its just slow going - not dangerous or scary at all. 

Hotel: 

We stayed at Gaia Hotel.  We booked in early September but since we were here over the US thanksgiving holiday, we found a lot of hotels were booked.  We had the Loft Suite, which was very large.  The hotel was fantastic.  They are on a nature preserve, so when we parked, we immediately saw sloths, macaws (they have a macaw conservation project on site), howler monkeys, white face monkeys, iguanas.  The hotel is very nice but it is more ""eco hotel"" than western style/5 star chain hotel.   The staff is incredible, and remember your name.  We prefer to do things independently, but they would arrange anything you needed (tours, cars, etc).  The owner of the hotel is often around making sure everyone is happy, and you have your own concierge to text. The restaurant on site is great, and it does include breakfast.  The breakfast was also great, and almost was too much food (fruits, various breads and your choice of entrees).  It would be very easy to never leave the hotel,.  One note, it is up on the hill so you'll park at the bottom and take golf carts up.  There are incredible views but it is not on the beach.  It is about a 3-5 minute drive to the restaurants in Manuel Antonio and in Quepos.  It was about 10 minutes to Manuel Antonio National Park.  The roads are mountain roads without sidewalks so walking anywhere from the hotel would be difficult/unsafe. 

  
Activities: 

We did the following activities over 3 full days (first day was travel, etc).  We didn't have a ton of time for beach/pool but that was fine with us.   There were beautiful beaches all around though. One thing to keep in mind is that is is very dark by 5:30pm so you really need to be done with any activities pretty early and get an early start (sun rises early as well).  We did get rain every day but only really started after 4pm as it was getting dark anyways.  Only one activity we had was impacted by rain (and that was just the 1 hour free Macaw Reserve tour at our hotel).  We have heard this level of rain this late in the season is atypical but who knows anymore or what will become the new normal going forward. 

  
\-Manuel Antonio National Park: We did book on viator.  You can search for ""Mauro"" or his instagram is ""Officialguidecr"".  [https://www.viator.com/tours/Quepos/Manuel-Antonio-Guided-Tours/d4507-193251P1](https://www.viator.com/tours/Quepos/Manuel-Antonio-Guided-Tours/d4507-193251P1)   You do need to buy you entrance ticket separate from the tour.  We really enjoyed having a private tour since you didn't need to wait for 10 people to look at each animal through the telescope.  Mauro had a great telescope that allowed us to see animals so close (including spider eggs). He also took photos through it and airdropped us all the photos at the end of the trip.  I've seen a lot of debates on here if you need a guide at Manuel Antonio.  I can say, we only would have seen the monkeys if it weren't for Mauro.  I highly recommend a guide, and specifically Mauro. We did 2 hours with him, and then about 90 minutes on our own walking the other trails.  I would almost say the national park is not worth the entrance unless you have a guide, and if you just want to walk through a rain forest, you can get that at Rainmaker or Nauyaca. 

\- Rainmaker:  We really enjoyed this.  It took us about 90 minutes, and is more of a hike than what I had read.  I would wear hiking shoes to the extent you have them.  There are several swinging bridges, waterfalls, etc along this 3 mile trail.  Other than the bridges, most of the trail is dirt/stairs.   Due to the rain, they advised against swimming but in other times, you could stop along the trail to swim.  We are in La Fortuna now and will probably skip Mistico as we feel like we already got this experience at Rainmaker.  We did not do a tour and just drove ourselves.  

\-Nauyaca Waterfall Nature Park:  This was one of the more confusing ones to book.  There are 2 separate entrances that take you to the falls.  After a lot of research, we booked the Waterfall Nature Park (https://www.nauyacawaterfall.com/).  It is 20-30 minutes further than the other entrance and does require about 15 minutes on a well maintained dirt road.   The steepest part of the ""dirt road"" is now paved so it wasn't a bad drive.  We did not have a 4x4 and even during very rainy November, we had no issues. It is pricey but you could easily stay all day here.   The checkin area had picnic tables with great views, and beautiful birds, free coffee and games.  We hiked down and took the truck  back up.   The hike down to where the truck  would drop you off wasn't really anything great but it does save you a few dollars.  The truck drops you off a  beautiful ""shelter"" with incredibly nice bathrooms, changing rooms, showers, tables, walking sticks, swings and hammocks.  At this shelter area, we saw a mama sloth with a one day old baby, as well as toucans.  The trucks drop you off at this point, and it is a steep 15+ minute hike down to the falls so everyone will end up hiking even if you select the truck option.  Once you're down there, there are 5 trails, we did 4 of the 5 and enjoyed all of them.  They are only about 10 minutes each and easy to loop.   The falls are amazing, but for the best swimming, go all the way to the pool at the base of the upper falls.  The other side of the waterfall and lower pools were very crowded but we had this pool largely to ourselves. In general, the company did a great job at this park.  We were there 3 hours but could easily have brought lunch and enjoyed it more.  The company has done a great job in the whole area.  We stopped at Domincal on our way back and had lunch at Fuego Brew.  Food was fine but probably the worst meal of our trip.  It was a very cute brewery and the town is a cute surf town for an hour stop though.

\-Mangrove Tour:  We were unsure on this one as we had wanted to do the kayak tour but the more we read, we learned the kayak tours move very slow and you can't cover much of the mangrove area in a few hours.  After seeing a few of the kayaks from our boat, I think we made the right decision.  Kayaks just can't cover as much of the water/area as the boats. We enjoyed our tour with Mauro so much, he told us he did other tours so we booked directly with him to do a boat Mangrove Tour.  We paid $60 USD per person. There were 2 others on our boat. We didn't see a lot of animals (a lot of birds, one crocodile and some monkeys) but the eco system of the mangrove was really interesting.  Our boat captain also took us to his house/farm on Damas Island and showed us animals and secluded beach.  It was a great experience but if you are limited on time/money, this could be skipped.   Again, highly recommend Mauro for any of this tours. 

# Parque Nahomi:  this is just a small park at the end of Quepos (by the Marina) but it was a beautiful stop to bring our picnic lunch with a great view. 

  
Restaurants.  In general, we found all the food to be pretty good for a tourist area.  Nothing was amazing but nothing was bad.  Our fish was always well cooked, which isn't easy.  Price wise, we found it to be similar to where we live (but LA is an expensive city) but definitely not inexpensive.  If you leave the tourist areas, it is obviously much cheaper.   With it getting dark early/rain coming in the evenings, it is helpful to have a decent restaurant at your hotel so you don't need to leave if you don't want to.  We ate at La Luna (the restaurant at Gaia) twice and both times were good.  

\-Milagro: We had fish and shrimp tacos after Manuel Antonio National Park.  As Angelenos/Californians, we are pretty picky about tacos but both were fantastic.  Definitely recommend the tacos here 

\-El Lagarto:  Everything here is wood fired grilled right in the restaurant.  Grilled steak and fish with baked potatoes and veggies.  It was pretty good. 

\-Falafal Bar:  We really enjoyed the pita sandwiches, and took them to go and ate at Parque Nahomi. 

\-Emilios:  This was also good.  I think there's a handful of restaurants in Manuel Antonio that are all pretty similar.  Pretty good food for a tourist destination. 

\-El Avion/Agua Azul:  We didn't eat at either of these but just had drinks at sunset. Good views.  In general, we found all the cocktails in the area to be very sweet but if you ask for ""no sugar"", that seemed to help.  

Packing:  It is a very casual area.  Swimsuits, hiking clothes (shorts are a must) and hiking boots/tevas are all you need. We brought a few other ""regular"" clothes but shorts and t shirts are definitely all that is necessary. It was very humid and muddy when we were there so expect to get pretty dirty if hiking. 

  
In general, we loved the area and found it to be very safe/easy to get around.  Locals are very nice to tourists and seem to really love sharing their beautiful home with us.  If you love animals, I would highly recommend Manuel Antonio.  ",3,1733149752.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

1h4w66o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgoPoker/comments/1h4w66o/my_career_as_a_professional_gambler/,My Career As A Professional Gambler,"I first started playing poker serious I guess when I was 19. I used to go to this internet cafe and try and grind online poker. I'd Western Union some cash to PokerStars. Go broke. Rinse and repeat. I also would play poker with Alex and Jamie. Jamie was a low class sociopath, but a decent card player. Alex hosted a game at his apartment every Thursday, which eventually morphed into a whole weekend affair. The blinds were usually .25/.50. We had all sorts of regulars. The pool players. Brad with his ""drawer full of three grand cash"" who used to have a coke habit in Montreal. That guy who worked at Teletech, Andrew I think was his name. He was a character. Jamie's girlfriend Caroline would play or deal, and then Jamie had some orbiters like Stu. 

I remember one day Stu and Jamie and I were playing three handed at Jamie's place. It was like a 2 cent 5 cent game or something. Anyway, Jamie pushes all in on the river. Stu counts down his stack like two chips at a time, before finally calling all in with the full house. It was the greatest slowroll ever, and Jamie was a pretty emotional guy. Another day I was playing there and he pointed a 22 at me. APparently it was unloaded, but I freaked out and left. Jamie was a beard tenant I guess you could say so some guy could grow weed in his basement. I guess I was still living in the East end of London Ontario around that time.  


Sometimes I would get some money and go on a casino run. Set up in a hotel and try to grind 1/2 nlhe at the casino. But I always went broke.  Eventually I moved to Kitchener / Waterloo with some college guys. I was probably 21 or 22 at the time. Actually the change in environment served me very well. I had nothing to do but grind online poker and chain smoke cigarettes, and I managed to build a bankroll out of very little. I did have some money coming in, I would get $250 a month and $10,000 a year as payment from an insurance settlement. But the 10k a year only lasted 5 years and the $250 a month tapered off eventually too. But I managed to parlay that 10k into something real, grinding PokerStars and Party Poker, and finally a huge score on the World Poker Exchange.

I also did well in a really wild 5/5 nlhe home game. I remember one key hand, I had ace high flush. My opponent bet like $5 on the river, I raised to $50, he went $150. I just called. only straight flush beat me. He had it. Actually the first time I played there I went all in on TPTK and this crazy Yugoslavian guy called me on runner runner and hit it. I thought the game was rigged, but it turns out no he was just a crazy whale and I ended up beating him for thousands of dollars. Probably more than 10k. One we were playing heads up 5/5 and he straddled for 100. I jammed AK for 1k and he called with AQ and I won unimproved. I did some casino trips to Niagara Falls around this tim.

Eventually I moved in with my friend Eli. Had year or two with him, not even sure how long. Spent a lot of money partying it up with friends. Went broke. ANyway, fast forward to I'm like 26 years old. I inherit some money and move to Niagara Falls and start grinding there. The minimum stake was 2/5 NLHE. The games were super soft, all tourists, and I had a huge bankroll. I did pretty well, won maybe 20k in the first few months. Then I discovered blackjack. I had some wild swings playing blackjack. I won a lot of money, I had tons of grey 5k chips. Mostly I would martingale, if I lost I would just keep betting higher and higher. It worked for a while, until it didn't. But somewhere along the way I learned how to count cards and I started playing a winning game. After months of degening, I employed a system. It was pretty aggressive, something like this.

TC + 2 2 x 500  
TC + 3 2 x 1000

TC + 4 and up 2 x 1600.

Something like that. Anyway, I got into a routine. Show up at the casino high limit. Grind blackjack for 10 hours, drinking black coffee, orange juice, and water. Eat some singapore noodles. Go home.

The way the games were set up there, they had tons of dealers, and I would just leave the table when the count got to -2 TC or so. Wonging pretty aggressively. So I got in a ton of rounds because there was always a new shoe to hop to. Anyway, over the next two weeks I won pretty big. I think I had upwards of 200,000 on me by the time they backed me off.

First thing I did was head straight for Rama. I think I took a cab there for a few hundred. At Rama I won like 20k over the weekend then got backed off. Then it was straight to Caesars, where I had some negative variance but ended up breaking even. So then I did like a cross country tour.

Eventually I settle into an apartment in London Ontario. I run for mayor, that was a bust. Spent 5k on stupid t-shirts. ANd because I didn't file the paperwork about my expenses I got banned from running for mayor again. Some democracy we have. I would do casino trips to Niagara Falls and Montreal. Even Calgary and Vancouver. Spent time with friends. Did way too many drugs. Eventually I packed up and headed out West and settled in edmonton.

Welcome back to another edition of **Open Interest** \- the only GME price movement forecast dedicated to an analysis of the options market!

[From our boy on 1 Dec 2020](https://preview.redd.it/xqp4i8j43g4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=49fd207ffce225a9575fd0cc0ebfb71c7d93eb3a)

Happy Monday everybody! We've got another big week coming up on our road to Q3 earnings.

Key questions for today:

1. What happened on Friday?
2. Does Friday's price action jeopardize our Bull Trend?
3. Is a Pre-Earnings $35 Test still in play?

Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

[GME Trading Day 11\/29 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/41vpbh163g4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=64bfc18e14159c9e2fa80e214448e43a67c52501)

So what happened on Friday? Why did we turn directly into a diagonal line downward from open to close? Why does this happen?

It is essential to remember that institutional participants \*can\* spontaneously manipulate the stock price to the downside when and as it suits them to a certain degree by borrowing shares available for loan and dumping them on the tape. We've seen this happen in small, targeted bursts before, such as on 11/21 and much earlier through August, September, and October. It doesn't \*always\* happen, but it happens with enough frequency to necessarily take into account on any given trading day.

While most price action \*is\* driven by MM options hedging activity, these share dumps can have a profound effect on the price. In this case, whoever wanted this careening off a ledge to occur and smash through the $30 Call Wall support back to the downside did so only by borrowing over a million shares throughout the day to dump on the lit market. In just the first 45min of trading, 900,000 shares were borrowed to sell short.

https://preview.redd.it/cndkgmcf3g4e1.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4d3230fee74b87d154e5c1a04808b7965c9180e

From our volume data, these shares do not appear to have been shorted all at once, but rather dropped at key times in order to thwart bullish options activity rebounding off our key gamma levels.

These volume spikes in yellow total well over half a million shares with the first two outlier candles after the beginning of our rebound off of $30 totaling nearly 300,000 and the cluster of five outlier candles at the bottom of the drop below $30 totaling over 600,000. Additional shares were borrowed later in the day in small increments taking the total shares available to borrow all the way down to 750,000 in after hours trading:

Who knows how many of these were actually borrowed earlier in the day and shorted on the lit market? Certainly not I. However, it does appear that a fair number of those borrowed shares still have not been returned and made available again:

https://preview.redd.it/nncm9i1c3g4e1.png?width=421&format=png&auto=webp&s=302170bc871805ea02444687facb0a03e8d5d86e

This may indicate that these shorts are waiting to buy back their shares on the lit market in order to fuel a recovery to the benefit of bullish options they picked up amid their own tanking of the price, knowing that they would have to buy back these shares eventually anyway.

At the very least, the culprit for this price activity is easy to spot, but now let's take a look and see if we can get some insight into what the implications of this price activity might be as we move forward.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

https://preview.redd.it/3iw5a1oi3g4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=f39ecc5054d152d75945ccda9e45f897585634ec

We yet again have a fair amount of new OI following on the Monday following a weekly wipe. We still see a fair amount of OI - and new Call OI - in the lower end of $30-$35 bracket with some $29 OI inserted just below our largest Call OI position for the week at $29. We did have some new Puts opened for this week, notably long at $27.

https://preview.redd.it/9kihgwzl3g4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=13a194a415de334b34dda353acbba2afdec2c122

Next week's modifications were modest with exception of $30 and $32.

ChartExchange still hasn't updated Max Pain and OI data, but Maximum-Pain is showing $26 as our Max Pain strike currently, an improvement over last week by a full dollar if accurate.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/rav2i1sn3g4e1.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7ffe93066f836403859b315d8bc60b66840d362

Our Daily Put-to-Call GEX ratio is back up slightly above 1:4. Within our current bullish trend, ratios above 1:4 have been followed by significant upside reversal in our price as on 11/18-19 and 11/22-11/25. Whether this correlation will continue remains to be seen.

https://preview.redd.it/n7e6esjo3g4e1.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ba9ce0dd6b131e6fd1648b82d76b99a5889753e

As we take a look at our gamma hedging structure for today we see that Friday's overall shape has been preserved, namely that our Call Wall still sits at $30, our total gamma is pretty sparse to the downside until $25, though there is some light Call gamma accumulation at $29, $28, and $27. However, we still have the $31, $32, and $33 framework enabling a potential 'pull' up from $30 should the price be able to breach and mount our Call Wall.

If for some reason those same short institutions from last week decide they want to try to blow up our technical paradigm they could try to force us down into a morass with little hedging, but they only have 1.5mil shares to do so and in the event of an all-out short assault would probably only push us down to $27 at most on that type of move. Doing so would also send some pretty heavy oversold signals and be countermanded by long institutions looking to catch that short institution or institutions with their pants down.

The likelier scenario here, I think, is that we open around or move down to around where the 50-4hr SMA is currently sitting. On my chart I'm seeing $28.48 and premarket price at time of writing is between $28.75-$29. Whoever is short those shares from Friday could then start buying to close their position (still 700,000 shares unaccounted for from Friday), take the price back up over our Call Wall, drive some options buying, and then drive whatever cheap Calls were picked up on Friday into the money while attracting the exit liquidity to do so.

As we'll see from our technicals shortly, this obvious upside move is being telegraphed to the broader market for anyone with eyes to see and might be buttressed by some pre-earnings IV appreciation magic. If so, it would set us back up in a stable trading bracket above $30 for a grind up toward the top of our trading values where we might still get some prices in the $33-$34 range (upper end of the $30-$35 macrobracket ahead of earnings).

There is still plenty to watch out for, but with the bag of tricks already partially emptied on Friday, there is a strong chance of the elastic band 'snapping back.'

**Technicals**

https://preview.redd.it/n61nd2pp3g4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=04f40cfa6026fdc9c84e33da91403708048ac2cf

10/18-12/2 4hr Aggregation

A quick look at our continually pertinent 4hr chart reveals that despite how jarring that short-induced dump was on Friday, the price nonetheless remained within our upward trending technical paradigm, staying supported above the 50-4hr SMA in a position reminiscent of that encountered between 11/22 and 11/25. RSI has dipped below Neutral (<50) which has occurred twice within the past month coinciding with 50-4hr SMA touches. Each time this has occurred GME has broken out hard to upside over a period lasting at least 5 trading days. When paired with the 5-day trailing Call Wall breach price movement average of +5BP, we have a potent historical and statistical projection for a strong upside reversal basically immediately upon open today, one which still preserves the possibility of the $35 test scenario ahead of earnings which I outlined on Friday. Zooming out to the daily chart, you can see just how minimally our current paradigm has been challenged by Friday's shorting:

https://preview.redd.it/4nh1imhq3g4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d6d72cf41048cb233c453ce8f3d270f09c80c90

Nov 2020-Dec 2024 1-Day Aggregation with Key Historic Support/Resistance Inflection Point Price Levels

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/7exnzn8r3g4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8bc1b35340c1532f612b44c9f5535726b5afc7a

https://preview.redd.it/n3q02y1s3g4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d6bb263abc7f5a5d6b8df9be975396872a0ebbe

It is hard to tell at this point if we are seeing IV appreciation from the anticipation of earnings. However, if we do see a rebound this week off of the 50-4hr SMA touch and IV exceeds our high from last week's 10-Day Mean IV peak, then the appreciative effect is likely in place and will elevate our baseline continually in accordance with the general upward trend we have seen in its levels since Nat'l Cat Day.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

On Friday an institution or institutions dumped over a million of short shares (in excess of 65% of the total shares available to loan) on the stock over the course of few hours, strategically targeting our downside support at the $30 Call Wall. While this played spoiler to stable trading on Friday, downward momentum has taken us right down to the top of the lower band of our current technical paradigm, the 50-4hr SMA. With RSI showing a relative oversold signal at sub-Neutral (<50) levels, as well as continued MM Gamma hedging support above our $30 Call Wall, a rebound to the upside and a continued probe into our $30-$35 macrobracket seems likely ahead of earnings based on these factors.

Some questions of caution: Do these factors mean we have to test $35 in the next seven trading days? No. Does this mean at least that we have to break to the upside hard today? No. Options data, Charts, and technicals are not mechanically causal. They are representations of the byproducts of an aggregation of the true mechanical causes of the market and of its human and algorithmic participants. Within an undisrupted, closed, complex system they have proven for months to be highly valid with respect to their predictive power on daily and weekly price action. With that being said, when institutions stick their hands into the pie and stir it around, these short term predictors, assessed premarket, lose their validity.

When in doubt, however, zoom out. When short-term, more detailed indicators are disrupted by an institutional deus ex machina like we saw on Friday, our broader frameworks can provide us with meaningful insight into the magnitude of such interventions. While we will need to pay close attention to the integrity of our paradigm basically today, I still see no signals or indications to suggest that our current bull trend is critically endangered. At least, not yet.

Cheers and good luck out there, everyone! And another Happy Thanksgiving to all! :)

PS: Thanks again to all those who have treated me to coffee for the next few weeks. This week's coffee and newsletter is brought to you by the generosity of '**FrequentPoem**.' Be sure to thank Frequent this week in the comments for supporting our efforts here! Cheers, my friend :)

For those of you who are on X, I have, at the encouragement of several users, decided to start crossposting there. These posts will be identical to those found here on Superstonk, so no need to leave the party here. However, just in case there are any 'issues' with my posts in the future, you'll be able to find each and every Open Interest Newsletter in the Articles tab of my profile. Open Interest will remain aimed toward the Superstonk - and GME shareholder - community first and foremost. So, rest assured, this will in no way affect my attention here. @ MichaelTLoPiano if Reddit is down for some reason like last week.

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

None of my family live here, and his family is nearby. I have a good relationship with my MIL & FIL, and my relationship with my husband’s siblings (F29 & M25) is usually good. 

A few weeks ago, it was my 31st birthday. Last year, my BIL (25M) used my birthday gathering to plan his own birthday party. To avoid a repeat, I decided not to make a big deal out of this year’s celebration. I didn’t want to spend money on a party, and I didn’t want the attention to be diverted again. We decided to celebrate at my in-laws' house because they have more space. We invited my husband’s siblings and their partners. They arrived late, around 4:30 PM, which is typical for this family and not a big deal. Since I live in a foreign country, English isn’t the primary language. I know the language but I find it hard to keep up with many fast conversations at once. Everyone spoke in the local language throughout the evening, which made me feel disconnected & overstimulated. Eventually, I gave up trying to keep up and started scrolling on my phone.

The issue began when SIL (29F) asked if she could show her vacation pictures to everyone. In husband’s family, it's common to share vacation photos at gatherings, but the way SIL asked caught me off guard. She asked for my permission in front of everyone, which made me feel obligated to say ""yes."" I found it rude to show vacation pictures at someone else’s birthday celebration. I briefly excused myself to get coffee. When I returned, BIL and his girlfriend asked to see our wedding photos, which they hadn’t yet seen. SIL seemed disappointed, and she and MIL went to the kitchen, where they had a loud conversation that we could all hear from the living room.

After viewing the wedding photos, we had dinner, and SIL again pushed for us to look at her vacation pictures. She and her husband spent about an hour going through the pictures, explaining each one in detail. Again, it was in the local language, and I struggled to follow. My husband noticed and told me to put my phone away, which frustrated me further. The last picture they showed was a sonogram and announced their pregnancy. They had many chances to announce this before or after **that day**, but they chose that moment. I faked a smile, congratulated them, and excused myself to the bathroom. My husband and I left soon after, and he didn’t understand why I was upset. In his culture, it’s normal to announce major life milestones at others’ celebrations, but in my culture, it’s not. We argued about it for the rest of the night and the next day.

An hour later, SIL sent me a text justifying their timing and laughing it off. I responded, saying I was happy for them but hurt by the way they announced it. She later responded, claiming they were hurt by my reaction and that my response had ""cast a dark shadow"" over their happiness. She didn’t apologize but continued to justify her actions.

1. Our Butlers were Roger and Reynaldo. R&R were fantastic and highly recommended!
2. Rum Bar at the resort was awesome.  Since our first Sandals visit 5 years ago, I have really gotten into Caribbean Rum and having the Rum Bar on site was like a dream for me.
3. Rondoval room was great.  We really enjoyed the layout and private pool area.
4. Resort food here was the best we have had at any Sandals.  They only do reservations at the French Restaurant, so that was a plus for us.  We like to go early, so it was easy for R&R to get us in each night at 6pm. We went to every restaurant except for Zuka.  We decided to eat at the Italian restaurant twice!
5. Jerk Shak and Blum coffee shop were located perfectly also.  I went to the coffee shop every morning and We had Fish in Foil/Jerk chicken almost every day for lunch!
6. Since the weather was unpredictable, we did not go on any excursions.  We did do a quick boat ride but when we got out of the protected area, the swells were 3ft+ so we were only out about 30 mins.
7. Pool areas were positioned well.  The music was aimed more at one pool so I would call that the party pool.  You could still hear it at the quiet pool, but it was definitely more quiet.  
8. The sky bar area was great for a sunset cocktail and the raised sitting area above the beach bar was nice also.

 Overall, this has been my favorite resort!  The only drawback is the 2hr ride from the airport.  My wife does not like that...  However, It looks like AA is going to start doing flights to Ian Fleming airport everyday.  That is a lot closer so we will probably come back here soon!

1h4vzhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeMoneyOnlinefree/comments/1h4vzhk/earning_on_prime_opinion_tips_tricks_and_what_to/,"Earning on Prime Opinion: Tips, Tricks, and What to Expect","So, I’ve been using Prime Opinion for a bit now, and it’s actually a pretty fun way to make some extra cash on the side. Basically, you do surveys to earn points, and you can cash out once you have enough. Plus, they have a few bonus features to boost your earnings, which makes it a bit more interesting!

**Earn Money by Taking Surveys**  
The main thing here is the surveys. They’re usually pretty quick and straightforward, and you earn points for each one you complete. I’ve been doing them during coffee breaks—it’s a nice way to feel productive and earn a little something on the side! ☕💸

**Earn by Playing Games: A Mix of Fun and Frustration 🤨**  
Prime Opinion actually lets you earn by playing games too, which is cool, but fair warning: some of these games can be a bit unpredictable with rewards. Some are worth it, while others make you work a little harder than I’d like. But hey, if you like gaming, it’s another way to earn while having fun. 🎮🕹️

**Weekly Raffles: Win Up to 1,000 Points! 🎁**  
If you’re consistent and do at least one survey every day for seven days, you get entered into a raffle. Last time, I won 500 points (roughly $5), which covered my coffee costs for the week! ☕ Not a bad deal, so I try to keep up with the streak.

**Leveling Up: Unlock Extra Perks 📈**  
There’s a level system too, which makes it feel a bit like a game. Each time you level up, you unlock features and earn extra points. Maybe one day I’ll hit level 99 and be the ""Survey King""! 👑😂

**Quick Bonus: Use My Link for an Extra +10% on Surveys 🎉**  
If you use my link, you’ll get a 10% bonus on surveys for your first 24 hours, which means you can boost your points right from the start! It’s a win-win for both of us. 🎉

**Leaderboard System: Serious Effort Needed 😅**  
There’s also a leaderboard, but I’ll be honest—it’s a bit intense. I haven’t made it up there yet because you need to fill out a ton of surveys to stay on top. Maybe one day I’ll reach ""survey warrior"" status!

**Create Virtual Credit Cards with Your Points 💳**  
One of the coolest features: you can actually create virtual credit cards with your points. I made one for Amazon, and it worked perfectly. It’s a fun way to treat yourself with what you’ve earned!

If you’re looking to make a little extra in your free time, Prime Opinion is worth a shot. I’ve been using it while commuting or waiting around, and those points start adding up. Like they say, “little drops make a mighty ocean”! Give it a try and let’s start earning!",1,1733149172.0,MakeMoneyOnlinefree,1,1.0,False

Came into the living room and yawned and the first thing out of her mouth is ""ooof something smells really bad"" sorry I didn't get a chance to wash away all my nastiness this morning. Just made me feel like a disgusting ass pig. Then she has the balls to ask if she said something wrong. Like no you didn't not at all just make me feel like the disgusting ass pig that you married before he knew how much I turn you off. I'm so fucking sick of feeling this way because of the one person in my life that is supposed to not make me feel this way. Fuck I wish I could afford a divorce.

So, I recently grabbed a bottle of **Lemme Wake Up Gummies** from Amazon because I wanted an alternative to my usual coffee habit. I’m 30, a bit of a caffeine addict, and always looking for ways to stay energized without overloading on coffee. Here’s how they’ve been working for me:

These are basically Lemme's version of caffeine gummies.

**Taste and Texture:**  
These gummies legit taste like a sweet cappuccino with a hint of caramel. They’re chewy but not sticky, and the flavor is way better than I expected for a caffeine supplement. I actually look forward to taking them in the morning.

**Energy Boost:**  
Each serving of 2 gummies has like 80mg of caffeine with 30mg more of caffeine bean, so I take one or two depending on my day. The energy feels smooth—no jitters or crash like I sometimes get with coffee or energy drinks. It’s perfect for a light, steady boost, especially on those days where I don’t want to deal with brewing coffee.

**Convenience:**  
This is the real winner for me. I can keep them in my bag or desk and grab one whenever I need a quick pick-me-up. No need for a coffee maker or a trip to Starbucks, which has been a huge time and money saver.

**What I Liked:**

* **Tastes Amazing:** Cappuccino-flavored candy that wakes you up? Yes, please.
* **Portable and Easy:** Super convenient for work or on the go.
* **Gentle Energy Boost:** The caffeine hit is steady and clean, with no crash.
* **Price:** At $16 for 30 gummies, they feel much more affordable than most gummies. 

**What Could Be Better:**

* **Caffeine Tolerance:** If you’re a heavy coffee drinker like me, you might need two gummies to feel a significant effect, which uses up the bottle faster.

**Final Thoughts:**  
I really like the **Lemme Wake Up Gummies** as a portable, tasty alternative to coffee. They’re perfect for busy days or when you just want a little caffeine boost without a full cup of coffee. That said, the price means I probably won’t replace my coffee entirely with these, but they’ll definitely stay in my rotation for convenience.

Anyone else tried these? I’d love to know how they compare to your usual caffeine fix! ",1,1733149130.0,SupplementReviewTime,0,1.0,False

Also, I’ve always heard that K cups are old, low quality coffee. If that’s true, is the same true for Nespresso or are they higher quality?

I’m still deciding if I want to pull the trigger and replace my Ninja k cup machine with a VertuoPlus Deluxe. I have the Essenza Mini already so it would be an addition. ",1,1733148965.0,nespresso,6,0.67,False

I’ve hardly talked to this person during this time. Over the weekend I started seeing someone exclusively so I just texted the other guy to tell him I have to cancel because I’m seeing someone. He replied with What? I’ve already booked a hotel. Shouldn’t he just say okay and move on? Mind you, before this he asked me to drive three hours to see him for an afternoon and after that 3 hour round trip for a coffee…. Would I be a shit person if I just blocked him?

1h4vvvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h4vvvp/aitah_for_making_bacon_at_3_am/,AITAH for making bacon at 3 am,"A little background info: 

My biological parents passed away when I was 14, and I got adopted by my current guardians: Marcie (67 F) and Patrick (65 M)- My biological parents knew them and thought they would be a good fit for me if anything happened to them. 

I moved in with them when I was 14, and I just recently turned 18 in October. Marcie and I don’t really get along, she always makes me feel bad about myself, and if I try and address how she makes me feel, she seems to push the blame onto me. Now, moving onto the story. 

Today I woke up at 2AM. I had school, and I knew if I went back to sleep I’d wake up late. So i decided to have some coffee and stay up til I started getting ready which is normally around 5AM. I Sat for an hour on my phone and realized I was so hungry and was really craving some bacon. So I went to the kitchen and cooked some bacon. All was okay, I cooked 5 pieces, nothing was burnt (keep that in mind). I went to my room and ate the bacon. 

About 5 minutes later, I heard Marcie running downstairs to put our Husky outside. Then, she came and banged on my bedroom door. I told her to come in, and she immediately started yelling. She said that she woke up and smelled something burning, so she jumped out of bed because she “thought the house was on fire”. In the middle of this, she tripped on the dog and hit her head on the floor. She ran over to where I was sitting and told me to feel the huge lump on her head, that happened “because of me”. 

I explained I just wanted some bacon, and I didn’t mean to scare her. She didn’t reply to that, and instead asked if I cooked all of the bacon. I told her no and that I only made 5 pieces. She looked at me with disgust and slammed my bedroom door and went back to her room (which is upstairs). 

I decided to play some games to take my mind off of it, because I was kind of shooken up. Then she texted me, telling me that Patrick would be driving me to school because she “has a huge goose egg on her head, and is seeing double.” I just texted back “Ok, sorry you fell”. 

Later on before Patrick got home, I thought it would be nice of me to go upstairs and tell Marcie I was sorry she hit her head and it was never my intention to scare her. So, I went upstairs and she glared at me from the second I walked into the bedroom. I told her I just wanted to say I was sorry for worrying her, and that she hit her head, but I also explained as calmly as possible that I don’t appreciate being yelled at. She said “excuse me?” and continued to tell me that she wasn’t “having this discussion with me”. I stared at her confused and she told me to “just think about it, and maybe i’ll understand”. She said that she accepted my apology, but it’s my fault for cooking the bacon and scaring her like that, I just said “okay” and closed the door and walked downstairs. 

I’m still not sure what to think, I know I probably shouldn’t have made bacon at 3am, but I feel her reaction and blaming me completely was a bit too much. So, reddit, am I the A-hole? ",1,1733148883.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False
