1qp02qz,https://i.redd.it/s3uhd1kne0gg1.png,Surprising my Boyfriend with My Wedding Without Him,"“Mom, about what Dad said years ago… I’ve decided to go through with it. Tell him to arrange the marriage.”



I ended the call, and the music flooded back in. Audrey’s birthday party was still in full swing.



Audrey—the girl I once saved from bullies, who I thought was my best friend.



Jared, my boyfriend, and Jackson, my closest childhood friend, changed the moment Audrey entered our lives. Suddenly, she was their everything. They laughed with her, cared for her… and eventually, they told me they loved her. Right to my face.



Then came the dinner. Just the three of us. A final attempt to fix things—so I thought. But when Audrey called, crying about being robbed, they left me. Again.



It was raining. I wandered the streets, soaked and alone, until I was hit by a car. They never even bothered checking on me.



So I packed my bags. Booked a flight. Met my groom.



Then I sent Jared and Jackson one last message: My Wedding Invitation.



\--



“About what father said years ago…” I paused, my voice barely rising above the music thumping through the villa walls. “I’m now agreeing to get married. Please tell him to arrange all the prep work. No need for romance—make it just formal.”



There was a moment of stunned silence on the other end before my mother’s familiar voice broke through. “Are you sure about this? What about your boyfriend, Jared? Did you finally break up with him?”



“Not yet,” I replied, firm but tired. “Don’t tell anyone about this yet.” I swallowed the ache in my throat. “I’ll send the other list for the agreement and return home as soon as possible.”



Then I hung up. The phone slid from my hand and dropped onto the soft mattress beside me. That’s when the noise outside clawed its way back into my senses.



It was Audrey’s birthday. The adopted daughter of my parents. The girl I once thought of as my little sister. The same girl I’d defended from bullies back in high school, when the four of us—me, Audrey, and my childhood friends Jared and Jackson—were supposed to be a family.



Back then, I thought I was doing the right thing. That helping her would bring us closer. That we could all live in one house and laugh over dinner. I never imagined she’d twist everything.



Audrey was clever like that. She’d wormed her way into everything. She used to tag along with us—me, Jared, and Jackson. I didn’t mind. At first. But then it was like she started trying to replace me. Whispering things to Jared when I wasn’t looking. Making Jackson laugh in a way that used to be just mine. Still, I told myself not to overthink it.



But then I saw it. The kiss. It was supposed to be a quiet night. Just me and Jared who eventually became my boyfriend as we both confessed our love. Then, I caught him and Audrey kissing.



I let it go—for a while. But it happened again. And again.



Every time I asked, Jared brushed it off. “You’re just jealous,” he’d say. “She’s like a sister.”



Jackson said the same. “Don’t ruin everything because you’re being insecure, Maureen.”



But it wasn’t insecurity. It was betrayal.



And now, here I was—alone at her birthday party. Watching the three of them giggle and clink glasses like they were the main characters in some twisted romantic comedy. Jared had just taken a shot—and with a laugh, he pressed the empty glass to Audrey’s lips, his free hand grazing her body as if they were already lovers.



I couldn’t breathe. I got up and quietly slipped back into one of the guest rooms upstairs. But just as I was pulling the blanket over my head, the door creaked open.



“Maureen?” Audrey’s voice was laced with fake concern. “They’re looking for you downstairs. We’re about to do the fireworks.”



I stayed still. “I’m tired and sleepy. Just go.”



“Come on…” She stepped closer. “It’s my birthday. Are you really going to be like this?”



I turned to face her, my voice low. “Audrey, isn’t it enough that I was forced to be here?”



She frowned. “Do you really hate me now? Is it because you think I stole them from you? That was never my intention. Please… we used to be best friends—”



“Stop.” I held up my hand. “Just go enjoy your party.”



But she wouldn’t. She grabbed my wrist, tugging. “Let’s go. It’ll be fun. I’m happy when you’re with me—”



“Don’t touch me!” I tried to yank away, but her grip tightened.



In the struggle, we lost balance. We both fell backward—Audrey crashing into the small table beside the bed. The vase on top tipped and shattered, the shards slicing into our arms and shoulders.



Pain bloomed down my forearm, but before I could react, the door flew open.



My boyfriend Jared. He didn’t rush to me. No. He ran to her.



“Are you okay? Audrey—what happened?!” he asked, checking her wounds, brushing the glass from her skin.



“She pushed me,” Audrey whimpered. “I didn’t mean to—she just—”



“What the heck, Maureen?!” Jared turned to me with a snarl. “You’re ruining everything. Again.”



I stared at him, speechless. Blood dripping from my hand.



“She attacked me,” I said, shaking. “She pulled me. I told her to stop—”



But he wasn’t listening. Neither was Jackson, who had now joined them. “You’re always like this,” he snapped. “Jealous. Dramatic. Can’t stand not being the center of attention.”



Then I was told to apologize. Even with blood soaking through my sleeves, I was the one ruining her birthday.



Jackson grabbed me by the arm. “Come on. You’re coming downstairs. We’re celebrating. You’re not going to embarrass the family again.”



So I went. Bruised, bleeding, humiliated—I stood beneath the fireworks, watching them laugh and dance.



Just one last time, I thought. One last time, I’ll try. I joined the circle by the bonfire, fake smile painted on like war paint.



The music swelled. People cheered. I was swaying, barely holding it together when I felt the shove. Jared pushed me? How… why?



I stumbled straight into the bonfire’s edge. Pain exploded up my arm as flames kissed my skin.



I screamed.



Someone screamed with me—Audrey. She rushed to my side, panicked. “Oh, god! Maureen is hurt! We need to call an ambulance—she’s hurt—”



But Jared stepped in, shaking his head. “It’s nothing. Just a small burn. She’ll get by. It’s her punishment for hurting you a while ago.""



And Jackson? He didn’t even look at me.



No one helped.



I dragged myself away from the fire. Then I hailed a cab.



No one offered to take me to the hospital. No one cared that I was bleeding.



But that was fine… because this is the last time they’re going to hurt me again.



Chapter 2



“It’s a good thing you came in right away,” the nurse said as she gently cleaned the raw skin of my arm. “This is a second-degree burn, and you needed stitches too.”



I didn’t respond. Just nodded. The white ceiling above me blurred. I stayed at the hospital for two more days.



Not a call. Not a single message. No “Are you okay?” No “Sorry for what happened.”



Nothing. They didn’t even care enough to pretend.



On the second evening, I found myself aimlessly scrolling through my phone. Maybe some part of me still hoped they’d reached out. But all I found were photos.



Bright, glowing snapshots of Audrey in her brand-new red dress, smiling between Jared and Jackson. Champagne glasses raised. That same smirk on her lips that she always wore when she knew she had won.



“Thank you Jared and Jackson for the best birthday ever! I’ll treasure this forever! Look at our new friendship bracelets!!!”



I zoomed in. Three matching bracelets. And then Jared and Jackson no longer wore our friendship bracelets like before.



I turned off the screen and placed the phone face down on the side table. Just silence again. My heart pounded in that silence. But it didn’t hurt anymore. It was just… empty.



Two days later, I was back at the apartment. The same place we’d all moved into after college. It was supposed to be a home for a family, only that they had betrayed me.



I stepped inside the quiet living room and headed straight to my bedroom. I opened the closet and began to pack.



I reached for my shoes and then paused. There it was—the memory box. That dumb, stupid box I had once called my ""treasure chest.""



I sat on the floor, dragging it out, letting the dust coat my fingers. Inside were letters. Crumpled, faded ones written by Jared and Jackson from when we were kids. Stick drawings, silly poems, “get well soon” cards when I had the flu.



And a photo. The three of us—me, Jared, and Jackson—kneeling by a treehouse, dirt on our clothes, wide grins across our faces.



I remembered that day. It was the summer I got bit by a dog. Or almost did. I was always terrified of dogs, and the neighbor’s dog had gotten loose. I froze, too scared to move. Jared and Jackson had jumped in front of me like it was instinct. Jared even got a bite on his arm just to protect me.



After that, everything changed. They became my shadows. My protectors. And somewhere along the way, I had fallen in love with Jared, while Jackson treated me like a sister.



Until Audrey ruined everything.



I sat on the floor, gripping a friendship bracelet with my name on it. I was such a fool.



My parents had warned me when I begged them to adopt Audrey. “Are you sure about this, Maureen? Not everyone wants a sister the way you do. And what if she hurts you? You can’t just trust anyone that easy.”



I hadn’t listened. I believed love would be enough.



But now?



Now I knew.



She didn’t want to be my sister. She wanted to be me.



I packed up the rest of my things. Then, I carried the memory box outside. I set the box down and lit the match in the backyard.



The flames caught quickly. The letters curled, blackening. The bracelets twisted in the heat, their gold sheen turning dull and dead. The photos dissolved into ash.



“Maureen!”



I turned at the sound of Jared’s voice. He came running from inside, panic written all over his face.



“What are you doing?!” he shouted. “Are those… are those our albums?! The bracelets?!”



“Yes,” I said simply. “I’m burning all our memories.”



He tried to move closer, but I stepped in front of the fire, blocking him. “It’s over. All of it.”



Jackson arrived seconds later, looking just as stunned.



“Is this some kind of tantrum?” he asked, arms crossed. “You’re upset, we get it. But this is dramatic, even for you.”



“This isn’t a tantrum,” I said, my voice calm, steady. “This is the end.”



“You’re really going to let one bad night ruin years of friendship?” Jared asked. “Maureen, don’t do this. We can talk—”



I met their gaze before turning to Jared. “I don't want to ever be with the both of you again.""



I turned away and walked back inside the apartment, the smoke still curling behind me.



Chapter 3



I thought they’d leave me alone after I burned everything. But they didn’t.



Days passed, and slowly, Jared started acting like nothing had happened. He began sending flowers again. He texted like a sweet boyfriend, asked about my day, and even tried to kiss me once when we crossed paths outside the building. It was as if nothing had ever gone wrong.



Jackson followed suit, playing the big brother again—bringing coffee, joking about old times. Every time they said, “Sorry about what happened, let’s fix things,” it sounded more like they were apologizing for a stubbed toe than years of neglect and betrayal.



Then they surprised me with dinner.



“Our treat,” Jared said. “At our old spot.”



Part of me wanted to delete the message and never look back. But another part of me—the tired, devastated part—wondered if maybe, just maybe, we could end this all without bitterness. Without hating each other.



So I went. The restaurant hadn’t changed. Dim lighting, warm wooden booths, soft jazz playing overhead. It smelled like rosemary and nostalgia. I sat down, watching them laugh, trying to recapture something that had long since died. For a few moments, it almost felt okay.



Then Jared’s phone rang.



He glanced at it and froze. “It’s Audrey.”



He answered, frowning. “What? Slow down… You were robbed? What? Stabbed?! Where are you—”



In seconds, both he and Jackson were on their feet.



“She’s crying,” Jared explained breathlessly. “She was attacked. We’ve got to go.”



They didn’t say goodbye. They didn’t even look at me again.



They just ran. Ran like their world depended on her.



I sat there in silence, staring at the half-eaten food. The candle on the table flickered until it burned out completely.



I paid the bill myself.



When I stepped outside, the sky had opened up. Thunder cracked across the heavens as rain poured relentlessly. The streets were nearly empty—no taxis, no buses. The restaurant manager offered me an umbrella, but they were already closed. I couldn’t stay.



So I walked. Each step was heavy. My bandaged arms ached. My body screamed for rest. But the worst part?



The thunder. It echoed in my chest, triggering a deep fear I’d carried since childhood. I always froze during storms. The lightning, the cracks—it made me feel like the world was about to split in two.



I wrapped my coat tighter and kept going, the city turning into a blur of light and shadows.



Then—a sharp light. A horn.



A car.



I didn’t even have time to move.



Then: darkness.



When I woke up, everything felt… soft. Too soft. I was in a room I didn’t recognize. Clean, white walls. Dim lighting. My body hurt, but it was dull, distant. I blinked hard, turning toward the sound of someone shifting nearby.



“Jared…?” I whispered.



But it wasn’t him.



A man sat in the corner, tall, dressed in black, his eyes unreadable. He didn’t move until I tried to sit up.



“You’re awake,” he said. His voice was deep, steady. “Don’t move too much.”



“Who… are you?”



“Roscoe,” he said. “I found you after the accident. Took you to the hospital. You were unconscious.”



I wanted to ask more. But everything spun—and I blacked out again.



When I opened my eyes again, Roscoe was gone.



No note. No contact. Just… gone. There were no missed calls. No messages. No check-ins.



Except for my mother.



Mom: Call me when you’re on your way here now. Everything’s ready now. Come home.



I didn’t tell her what happened. I didn’t want her to worry.



The nurse told me I’d been lucky. The car had hit me from the side, but nothing was broken—still, I needed a few more days to heal.



So I stayed. Alone.



Until discharge.



Back at the apartment, I stepped inside just to grab the last of my things before I booked my flight home.



That’s when Jared appeared at the door.



“Oh, good. You’re back.” He smiled like nothing had happened. “So, listen… we had to sell your car. And some of your things too. Audrey needed emergency funds, and—”



“What?” I asked, stunned. “You sold my things?”



“Relax,” Jackson said, walking in. “We’ll pay you back. But Audrey’s been through a lot after the robbery. She needs someone to take care of her—can you cook for her? She’s not eating well.”



I blinked, stunned. “Are you serious?”



Jackson’s brows furrowed. “Where’ve you been anyway? Audrey said you went to some party after the dinner. Don’t you think that’s not a good behavior when Audrey was in danger? You shouldn’t have been here with us! I think you’re being selfish.”



I felt like I’d been punched. I laughed. It came out hollow, broken. “Right. A party.”



Then I threw the hospital discharge file straight at them.



“There. That’s where I was. The hospital. You left me in the rain. I walked home through a thunderstorm. I got hit by a car.”



“What…?” Jared asked, staring. “You were in the hospital?”



“I thought you were with friends…” Jackson mumbled, confused. “Audrey said—”



“Of course she did,” I snapped. “It’s always Audrey, isn’t it?”



Before they could say more, a high-pitched scream came from the hallway.



“Help! Jared, Jackson—it hurts! Please!”



Audrey. Of course.



Always Audrey.



I didn’t wait to hear their response. I turned, stepped over the threshold, and walked away.



Chapter 4



My entire body still ached. So instead of leaving as planned, I stayed in my room, letting the dull pain anchor me to the bed.



I didn’t cry. There were no tears left.



When I opened my eyes again, sunlight streamed through the curtains, warm against my skin. And right there, at the foot of my bed, stood Jared and Jackson.



“Good morning,” Jared said with a sheepish smile, holding a tray. “We brought you breakfast.”



Jackson placed the tray gently on my lap. Toast, scrambled eggs, some fruit, and a glass of orange juice. Bland and almost cold.



“Thought you could use something to start the day,” Jackson added, sitting at the edge of the bed.



I looked at them. They looked casual. Relaxed. Almost happy. Like the last few days hadn’t happened.



“Look,” Jared said, scratching the back of his neck. “We’re sorry. Audrey told us she saw an Instagram story of you at a party that night… and she was just hurt, you know? She got robbed and stabbed while thinking you were out dancing. She… she thought you were ignoring her on purpose.”



Jackson chimed in. “She really believed it. So… maybe you should apologize to her. Just to clear things up.”



I stared at them in disbelief, then scoffed.



“Maybe you should apologize to me.”



That made them blink.



Jared frowned. “Why would we? It’s not like we did anything wrong. You didn’t tell us what happened. If you had, we could’ve been there for you.”



I let out a bitter laugh. “Do I need to beg to be cared about now? I was gone for days. You didn’t even check.”



“Don’t say that,” Jackson said firmly. “Audrey got stabbed. She needs us.”



“And I didn’t?” My voice sharpened. “So if I’m not bleeding in front of you, I don’t deserve a second thought?”



Before either of them could respond, the door creaked open and in she came.



Audrey. She wore a soft, oversized sweater and limped slightly. Her face was pale, lips trembling as tears welled up in her eyes.



“Are you picking a fight with me now, Maureen?” she whispered, her voice shaking. “I’m sorry. Okay? I didn’t mean to get hurt. I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.”



I watched her carefully. Her trembling, her pout, the subtle gaslighting laced in every word. Like she was the one being attacked.



Again. The tears slipped down her cheeks.



“I just… I don’t want us to be enemies. We were sisters once… I wish we could go back.”



And just like that, the boys snapped.



“Stop making her cry, Maureen,” Jared snapped.



“Come on, Audrey,” Jackson said softly. “You shouldn’t be walking too much. Let’s get you back to bed.”



They turned to her with such care, such concern—it stung.



“I’ll feed you,” Jared said as he took her hand. “You need to eat.”



“Yeah,” Jackson added. “You need your strength. We’ll get your favorite seafood in the other room.”



Then they turned back to me.



“You eat what we made, Maureen,” Jared said. “You’ve been discharged. Stop being so picky.”



And with that, they led Audrey out, leaving me alone again.



I looked down at the plate in front of me. The eggs were rubbery. The toast, dry. The fruit was unripe.



Across the hall, I could hear them laughing.



Audrey’s voice rang out clear: “Mmm, I love crab legs! You remembered I hate toast, right? Seafood’s my favorite!”



Of course it was. They gave me scraps and fed her a feast.



I didn’t cry. Not this time. I was just done.



My phone buzzed.



It was a message from Mom: Venue options are in. Also attached are the dresses. Let me know what you like, darling.



I tapped the call icon.



“Mom,” I said, my voice steady.



“Maureen! Did you get the pictures? What do you think of the flower arrangements?” she asked excitedly. “And also the dresses?”



“I like everything. It was actually hard to choose,” I replied. “I’ll finalize it today. But I think I like the vintage one.”



“Great! We’ll prepare it for you. How long until you come back? Your groom’s waiting, you know. He’s very eager.”



“Just a few more days. Something happened, but I’ll be there. I’m looking forward to wearing those dresses… to the wedding.”



Mom let out a soft laugh. “That’s my girl. We’ll wait for you.”



I hung up. I stared at the tray, untouched. Then I felt it—the silence shift.



I looked up. Jared and Jackson stood in the doorway. I hadn’t even heard them come back.



Their eyes locked on me, their faces unreadable.



Jackson’s voice came first. “Dress to the wedding?”



Then Jared stepped forward, his brows pulling into a frown. “Wedding? What wedding?”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

but I wrote a comfort scene for her, she needed a motherly hug ali asked if I could share it and she said yes

Today was just bad from wake to now. Boss coming down on you for the little things,  that one friend that was ride or die finally blocking you after sending a scathing message on how what you are doing is wrong. Even the coffee shop ran out of rose mint tea. Your doctor just called and moved the necessary yearly check up a month back onto a black out day at work.

 Marching down the street fuming you see an older woman sitting on the sidewalk leaning on a tree with her eyes closed. As weird as that may seem what your eyes go to is her shirt offering mom hugs. Who better to ask than a random stranger, asking your friend sometimes feels weird.

Walking over to her she is tapping a hand against a heart in blue and pink in her leg to some beat.

""Um... Excuse me ma'am"" you mutter in almost a whisper both hoping she will hear and she won't.

Suddenly her eyes fly open behind her glasses and straightens her skirt.

""I'm sorry sweetie, did you need something? Max almost didn't tell me"" patting the tree as she stands up

"" Um, no... It's nothing,  your shirt. I'm sorry to bother you"" you blurt out turning to leave. This was definitely a mistake, a random person and you started a conversation 

Suddenly a hand lands on your shoulder

""Hold on"" she says sternly then her voice softens. ""I wear this shirt so people that need it can feel safe to ask when their day is turning to crap. You came over so I know you need something. Please ask""

""MayIgetahug"" you mumble out rushed looking at the ground.

Chuckling she puts a finger under your chin and presses up so you look up. ""There is no shame in asking so never look down when you want a need fulfilled baby girl. Take a slow deep breath in and out and ask again, the right way""

""Ma'am can I get a hug and make it as momish as you can? You ask fighting her finger but not resisting enough to look down

As you start letting it go and your eyes start watering. ""I'm sorry."" You sniffle trying to pull back so you don't get your snot and tears on her. 

""Uh, uh. My shoulder is absorbent, the tear and snot stains are a badge of honor to this shirt. You, darling are not going anywhere until you are empty. So cry it out."" She whispers as she reinforces her hug.

After you taper out and get it all out she lets go and you almost fall, weak from holding everything in for so long.

""Whoa, sugar that took a lot out of you. Here let's get you to that bench and you can take a rest."" She chuckled holding you up and guiding you to the bench and setting you down at one end.

Sitting down she unrolls the pillow she had to show a mesh duster and pats her lap.

""Rest your head dear and you gather your energy, nap if you need it. I'm not going anywhere until you are ok.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

When I get off work you're one of the first people I talk to, and the only person I ask to hang with me. You don't judge me for my past, for not knowing how to make friends. 

You watch as I show you my artwork, you geek out with me over my favorite games, and you aren't afraid to be seen with me.

You don't pry when I mention certain things I can't stand. You want to fight my parents just as much as I want to fight yours. 

The way we met wasn't anything flashy, nothing like the love stories we gag at together. We happened to work at the same shitty convenience store, opposite shifts. Until the day you were told you had to join my shift. I trained you in a week, and we became a tag team. I'd pick you up on the way to work, you'd buy us both coffee. And then you started opening up first. I was chopping tomatoes and onions when we started talking more. It wasn't long before talking to you was the most natural thing in the world to me, and I didnt even realize you made my day brighter.

The day I was in a car accident you were the first person to reach out to me and see if I was okay. You were calmer than most, which kept me calmer than I thought. 

it wasn't long after that day that you quit. I fell back into a dull routine for months. And then, when I least expected it, you came back. We worked together again and I was overjoyed. 

But that also didn't last. We were both let go around the same time, and neither of us were given a reason. I found a job again first, and helped you look for one. Then life started kicking both of our asses. 

Somewhere between constantly asking you to grab things on top shelves at work and getting coffee together, my view of you changed. We started hanging out more often, grabbing meals together, more coffees, even just talking for hours.

But I don’t know if I can keep my feelings to myself for the sake of our friendship. I'm trying because I don't want to lose another friendship, but im wrestling with this internal conflict while struggling to keep our friendship the same.",1,1769570455.0,letters,1,1.0,False

My husband and I have been to Japan before (2015) and spent quite a bit of time being typical tourists in the “big three” cities. We’re going back for about two weeks in Sept/Oct, but this time we are doing a completely different kind of trip. It will be busy; we’ll \*almost\* always be on the move. A mix of hiking, brief stops in cities, and some periodic days of relaxation sprinkled in. Less about seeing tourist spots, more about nature and keeping fit and eating yummy food. I know that the cost of things has gone up everywhere as well, but I don’t know how inflation in Japan compares with Canada after currency value shifts. 

\*\*Itinerary\*\*

Tokyo - 3 nights (mostly for food, tbh)

\*Hike the Usui Pass, Yokokawa to Karuizawa\*

Karuizawa - 2 nights (plan: relax and enjoy nature and drink coffee and craft beer)

Narai-juku - 1 night (to stay at Byaku Narai for my husband’s birthday)

\*Hike to Kiso (Torii Pass, etc)\*

Kiso-Fukushima - 1 night 

\*Hike Nagiso to Tsumago to Magome\*

Magome - 1 night 

Hiroshima - 1 night

Miyajima - 1 night (plan to hike up the mountain)

Kyoto - 2 nights 

Osaka - 1 night (fly out of KIX)

I’m the type who likes to carry cash instead of constantly having to find ATMs/banks, especially if we’ll be on trail for a number of days throughout the trip. I know acceptance of cards is increasing, but I’d like to mostly not have to worry about it. Our accommodations are booked & I won’t need cash for that. 

What do you recommend as an appropriate amount of ¥ for two people for two weeks? 

We plan to eat well and don’t really have a strict budget, but we also know that some of the best meals in Japan are not necessarily expensive. We’re also typically happy to hit a konbini for snacks or light meals when it’s convenient or we’re short on time. 

We don’t usually go nuts on souvenirs, we typically buy one high quality item instead of many knickknacks (we bought a beautiful/quality kitchen knife last time), but I assume that will happen in a city near the end of the trip so we can likely use a credit card for that.

1qozqyv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qozqyv,Overall feedback appreciated,"To preface, I know this probably isn’t everybody’s style, but it’ll be my last time living on my own so I wanted to be more out there with the design in the space I’m about to move into.

ChatGPT described my interior design style/inspo as “eclectic editorial contemporary”. I’ve attached some inspo screenshots for reference. I definitely love mixing patterns, materials, old/new. I’m hoping to also bring in a west-elm adjacent style, more elevated, and don’t want the space to look too juvenile.

I currently already have the couch (I love it, thrifted for $75), pink chair (FB marketplace $15!!!), rug (from target, < $100), console table (FB $20) & lamp (FB $20). I’m just really proud of my scores haha. I’m on a fairly small budget - However, I’m willing to buy a new rug if the majority thinks that it doesn’t work but would ideally like to keep what I already have.

As far as the coffee table, I really wanted one that was two tier with a clear top so that I could display coffee table books on the bottom shelf and the one I’ve chosen seemed to fit the bill for the right price (~ $150).

For the accent tables, I mainly wanted them for functional reasons (eating/working on the couch).

I’m considering staining the console table too if need be (it’s a touch more orange in real life).

I’m mainly hoping to get feedback on things like furniture pieces because I have a few decorative items I’ll add to the space that will end up tying this together a bit more (imo). I’m just a bit lazy to include them all in the mock-up. I’m thinking about dark brown (burgundy maybe??) for curtains

1qozqgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UARSnew/comments/1qozqgt/searching_what_is_the_meaning_of_life/,searching what is the meaning of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

This cycle I received multiple pre-interview holds but **no II's**, and I am trying to understand whether there is a clear weakness in my application or if this is just how competitive MD-PhD admissions have become.

I am three years out of undergrad, with a 3.89 GPA and a 512 MCAT. I know the MCAT is not exceptional for MD-PhD programs, but I did not expect it to result in being screened out everywhere.

I have roughly 8,000 hours of research experience, including basic cancer biology in undergrad and full-time post-grad work in clinical and translational hematology oncology. I also spent 2.5 years doing data entry for a remote clinical trial, which gave me exposure to clinical research workflows. I currently work at a top-rated NCI cancer center as a research technician without a primary postdoc, giving me significant independence and first-hand experience building projects from the ground up. My work has always focused on hematology oncology, and I want to continue both research and clinical practice in this field.

I do not yet have a peer-reviewed publication, though a correlative project tied to a clinical trial is about to be submitted, and I built an independent project I plan to submit in June. I have presented research during undergrad and at a recent conference.

Clinically, I have two years volunteering in a pediatric hematology oncology clinic and \~80 hours of shadowing across inpatient, outpatient, and niche heme/onc procedures. I also volunteer at a local food bank and serve as a scientific mentor for junior lab members, from high school students to medical students.

Outside of research and clinic work, I served as a TA, acted as fraternity treasurer (eliminating debt), captained my university club tennis team, and was a campus tour guide. I have played piano since childhood as my main stress relief and enjoy cooking and coffee as hobbies.

I am confident in my scientific maturity, independence, and long-term commitment to physician scientist training. I am trying to understand whether the lack of publications is a major red flag, whether I am missing another weakness, or whether I was realistically filtered out primarily due to stats (MCAT).

If I reapply, I would appreciate advice on whether retaking the MCAT is worthwhile, how much weight pending or newly submitted manuscripts carry, how to adjust my school list, and what changes admissions committees expect from reapplicants.

(This is a throwaway account.)

I’m a 28F and finished my BA in Environmental Studies in 2024. I took my current job with a very small landscaping company because it offered a livable wage and allowed me to stay close to my family. Although it wasn’t the career path I originally planned, I’ve grown to enjoy the work—especially the hands-on skills, plant knowledge, and business mentorship over the last 2 years.

The owners are a married couple, C (43F) and J (57M). They’ve been generous employers and initially strong mentors, and I was even offered future ownership in the business after just two years.

I work primarily with J, who runs the job sites, while C handles the office side. From the start, I was very intentional about maintaining professionalism and clear boundaries, especially as a younger woman working closely with her husband. Because we live very close to each other—and because they pay for my vehicle—J and I often carpooled to distant job sites, which meant we spent a lot of time talking. I believed we had developed a professional friendship.

J is funny and very generous, but he tends to make risky jokes with everyone. On a few occasions, he made comments that made me mildly uncomfortable. I’m quick to set boundaries—especially with men—due to past experiences, and whenever something bothered me, I addressed it directly.

Over the last couple of months, J began acting cold and distant toward me without explanation. Today, C told me this distancing was intentional and tied to tension J has been feeling toward me. Apparently, J has been worried that he made me uncomfortable and chose to withdraw rather than talk to me directly. This has also been affecting his mood and has caused tension between him and C.

Two incidents seem to have contributed to this. The first was when J made an inappropriate joke about me rooting through his underwear drawer while I was pet-sitting for them. I immediately told him that crossed a boundary for me. This wasn’t the first time I’d corrected a too risky joke, and at the time, we talked it through and he said everything was fine. The second incident was when J and I met for coffee to discuss the business, and I asked whether C knew we were meeting. I meant this innocently and explained that I was just trying to be respectful and transparent with her, but it seems to have carried more weight than I realized.

Looking back, there were other signs that the dynamic had become emotionally complicated. J has very few friends and became emotionally open with me, including crying in front of me twice about how much my presence at work meant to him. He also told me he doesn’t express emotions like that with C. I didn’t encourage this, but I also didn’t fully grasp at the time how much emotional weight he was placing on our working relationship. I think I brushed some things under the rug, especially because he also shows clear love and dedication to C and their son. In hindsight, combined with what’s happening now, it feels like a lot.

To be very clear: J is the age of my dad, looks and acts similar to my dad, and I’ve swen him more as a father-figure if anything. I feel genuinely uncomfortable and upset at any suggestion of something inappropriate between us.

Because we had addressed those earlier incidents directly and he told me everything was fine, I assumed his recent coldness wasn’t my concern and had nothing to do with me.

Recently, C approached me privately to “resolve” the situation, explaining that things between her and J have been tense and that my presence at work has been part of that tension on and off since I started. She said J has no intention of discussing this with me directly. She also asked me not to tell J that she shared this with me, saying it would cause a major conflict between them if he knew. While C was respectful, this conversation left me feeling like I’m now working inside an unspoken emotional conflict that I can’t address or fix. While they seemingly both expect things to carry on as usual at work.

C suggested that I get coffee with J, and I initially agreed. But after thinking about it all day and talking with my family, I’m not sure how I can move forward. My parents admitted that they've been suspicious of J for a long time but didnt want to upset me, which was also a surprise.

This situation has made the job feel unstable. I care about both of them, but I don’t feel comfortable working in an environment where boundaries are unclear, communication is indirect, and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. At the same time, this job offers financial stability and (what i thought were) long-term opportunities I had been planning my life around.

Given the emotional entanglement, lack of direct communication, and power imbalance, I’m struggling to assess whether this situation can realistically stabilize, or whether it’s the kind of workplace dynamic that’s healthier to step away from.

Our grocery plan is that I shop for all veggies + fruits cause they're heavy + far away by subway (we don't have a car) and she shops half of the dairy/meat from the next door supermarket (I also shop there cause it's close so I tend to grab a few things on my way back from uni, hence my other half). Today she cooked (it was her turn) the last batch of frozen chicken we had, went to a bakery in the SAME COMPLEX AS THE NEARBY SUPERMARKET, and didn't think of getting chicken for the next few days. I passed by the supermarket on my way back to get a bunch of dairy so I told her when she's back from uni can she pls get ONLY chicken on her way because I couldn't carry everything back and she was like ""it's not my problem, it's your turn to cook tomorrow and you didn't know how to manage your time to get chicken. I didn't pay attention to how much chicken was left when I took it out to cook today so idc."" Bro what? I also had an 8:30am lab today and 6 hours total of classes/labs so I didn't have time to take out all the dishwasher (which I ALWAYS do btw cause I wake up earlier than her so I take it out 99% of the year) and when I came back she STILL DIDN'T TAKE THE DISHWASHER OUT. She said ""why didn't you do it if it only takes 2 mins"" when she only had 2 hours of class today (in the afternoon) and then hanged out with her friend. How hard was it to take out the dishwasher, which she only does once a MONTH when in a particular day I have a lot on my plate?

Anyways I got mad because these kinds of conversations happen on a daily basis and I couldn't hold it in anymore. I called her stupid (English translation, it's more rude in our native language) which ik I shouldn't have but also you can't expect me to stay respectful after you disrespect me so many times for so long like this. Like idt she should expect a nice response after we've talked a million times about what's expected from each person in this house? I just don't know what to do at this point. I talked to my parents and they talk to her about it, she adjusts for 1 day, and goes back to her old habits. I really want to just live alone but we can't afford for both of us to rent an apartment each, and we still have a few more years to go until we finish our degree.",1,1769569046.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Marriage and Divorce) 💔💼,"“Some vows are not broken—they are ache-unraveled, betrayal-braided, and lit by the fire of those who dared to love again.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

Three women—Sa Pi-young, Boo Hye-ryung, and Lee Si-eun—each in different stages of life, each married to men who once promised forever. But behind the polished facades of their marriages lie secrets, infidelity, and emotional erosion. As their husbands stray—some for lust, some for loneliness, some for ego—the women are left to confront not just betrayal, but the question: What remains when love is no longer sacred?

And in the flicker of late-night radio broadcasts, empty dinner tables, and whispered apologies, the ache of those who gave everything, and the fire of those who refused to disappear, the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with divorce papers and lipstick-stained coffee cups, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who stayed too long, and those who left too late.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign heartbreak, the mythic guardian of those who turned endings into emergence.

📜 Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Pi-young staring at her reflection in the studio glass, the Golden Inu beside her, tail curled like a question of self-worth.  
- Si-eun writing her next script, the Inu between her and the silence, eyes glowing with the ache of endurance and rediscovery.  
- Hye-ryung walking out of a courtroom, heels echoing like a verdict, the Inu behind her, eyes steady with sovereign chill.  
- A sigil of “이별 속 불꽃의 자각”—Flame of Realization Within the Breakup—etched in ring and resignation, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every betrayal and every boundary.  
- A whispered vow: “Even if the world calls it failure, I will guard the fire that remembered your becoming.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

🕯️ This scroll is a relic of sovereign reckoning, of marriage braided with ache and awakening, and of guardianship that honors the fire of those who dared to love, lost, and lived again.",1,1769569032.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False
1qozdgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qozdgz/hr_sparkles_the_magnificent/,[HR] Sparkles the Magnificent,"*A failing children's entertainer discovers his recent bookings share one thing in common: they're all at houses where someone recently died. When a client admits there is no birthday child—only an envelope of cash thicker than any honest gig would pay—Dennis faces the question of what a person becomes when survival requires not asking why.*

The house is a split-level ranch with yellow crime scene tape still fluttering from the mailbox. Dennis sits in his Civic with the engine running, looking at the booking confirmation. Party starts at 2 PM. It's 1:47. The deposit already cleared—$150, which means his electric stays on another month.

He knows this address. Woman stabbed her husband in the kitchen last Tuesday. He'd seen it on the news while eating cereal in his efficiency apartment, the reporter standing approximately where Dennis's car is now parked.

This is the third one.

The first time, he'd thought it was coincidence. A house in Riverside where a teenager had hanged himself in the garage. Dennis had arrived to find a grandmother who seemed confused about having booked a clown, but she'd paid cash and there were kids there—cousins, maybe—so he did forty minutes of balloon animals and card tricks. The whole time, he could see the garage door from the backyard. Someone had painted over whatever color it used to be with fresh white paint that didn't match the trim.

The second time, he'd known before he got out of the car. A duplex in Northside where a man had shot his girlfriend. Dennis had sat in the parking lot for twenty minutes that time, looking at his bank balance on his phone. Negative forty-three dollars. He'd gone in. A woman in her sixties answered, said she was the landlord, said she'd booked the clown for her grandson's birthday. There was no grandson there. She'd watched Dennis perform his entire routine in an empty living room, sitting on a folding chair, not smiling. She paid him in twenties that smelled like cigarettes.

Now this.

Dennis pulls down the visor and looks at himself in the mirror. He's already done his makeup at home—can't afford to waste the gas idling while he does it in the car anymore. White face, red nose, blue diamonds around his eyes. The wig is on the passenger seat, a purple explosion of synthetic fiber that cost him forty dollars in 2008 and has been shedding ever since.

His phone says 1:51.

He could leave. He could drive to the library and sit in the parking lot and use their WiFi to look for real jobs, the kind where you wear a polo shirt and say ""team player"" in interviews. He's fifty-three. He has a GED and a gap in his resume the size of a decade. The last time he applied to Target, they didn't even send a rejection email.

At 1:56, he puts on the wig.

The doorbell doesn't work, so he knocks. A man answers immediately, like he was standing right there. Mid-forties, glasses, wearing a cardigan in August. He looks at Dennis the way you'd look at a package you forgot you ordered.

""You're the clown,"" the man says.

""Sparkles the Magnificent."" Dennis does a little bow, the one that used to get laughs. His lower back pops.

""Come in.""

The living room is clean but wrong. The furniture is too neat, arranged like a showroom. There's a birthday banner hung over the fireplace—Happy 8th Birthday—but the letters are crooked, put up by someone who doesn't hang banners often. No toys. No kid debris. The carpet has vacuum lines.

""Where's the birthday boy?"" Dennis asks, though he already knows.

""He's shy. He'll come out."" The man sits on the couch, folds his hands. ""You can start.""

Dennis has been doing this for sixteen years. He knows when a party is wrong. He knew at the duplex, knew at the Riverside house. But he'd performed anyway, because the alternative was going home to an apartment where the refrigerator had nothing but condiments and a half-gallon of milk he was rationing.

He sets down his bag and pulls out the rainbow scarf chain. ""Okay, well, I usually start with some magic—""

""Do the one with the disappearing coin.""

Dennis hasn't mentioned the disappearing coin. It's not even one of his better tricks. ""Sure, okay."" He pulls out his coin cup. His hands are shaking slightly, which makes palming harder, but he gets through it. The man watches without expression.

""Again,"" the man says.

Dennis does it again.

""Again.""

On the fourth repetition, Dennis stops. ""Is there actually a kid here?""

The man looks at him for a long time. ""No.""

The word sits between them. Dennis should leave. He should grab his bag and walk out and never answer another booking email again. Instead, he hears himself say, ""You still paying the full rate?""

""Yes.""

""Okay."" Dennis pulls out the balloon pump. ""What do you want me to make?""

The man tells him to make a dog. Then a sword. Then a hat. Dennis makes them and sets them on the coffee table, where they squeak against the wood. The man doesn't touch them. He just watches Dennis's hands.

After forty-five minutes, Dennis's fingers are cramping and there are two dozen balloon animals on every surface. The room looks deranged, all those bright twisted shapes in the too-clean house.

""I think that's probably good,"" Dennis says. ""For the time you paid for.""

The man reaches into his cardigan and pulls out an envelope. Cash. Dennis can see the bills inside, more than the agreed rate. Maybe double.

""Next month,"" the man says. ""Same time. I'll send you the address.""

Dennis takes the envelope. It's thick. He could say no. He could ask what this is actually about. He could do a lot of things.

""Okay,"" he says.

In the car, he counts it. Four hundred dollars. He sits there with the bills in his lap, still wearing the wig, and tries to remember when he last had four hundred dollars at once. His phone buzzes—a text from his landlord about September rent.

He knows he'll go to the next one. And the one after that. He knows this the same way he knows his knee will hurt when it rains, the same way he knows the Civic needs new brake pads he can't afford. Some things you just know about yourself.

Dennis starts the car and pulls away from the split-level ranch. In the rearview mirror, he can see the man standing in the doorway, watching him leave. The balloon animals are still visible through the window, bright and absurd.

He stops at the gas station on the way home and fills the tank all the way up, not just twenty dollars' worth. It feels like wealth. It feels like drowning.

That night, in his apartment, he doesn't look up the next address when the booking email comes. He just accepts it and watches the deposit clear. The refrigerator hums. The lights stay on. Dennis washes the makeup off his face and sees himself underneath—fifty-three years old, tired, complicit.

In the morning, he'll buy groceries. Real groceries, not just ramen and peanut butter. He'll get eggs and bread and maybe even coffee that doesn't come in a red plastic tub. He'll feel grateful for these things.

And next month, he'll put on the wig again.

1qozd7x,https://i.redd.it/yj9z8hr490gg1.png,"Google pays $68M to settle ""Eavesdropping"" lawsuit: Did Assistant record you without permission?","Google has agreed to pay $68 million to settle a massive class-action lawsuit alleging that Google Assistant illegally recorded users' private conversations even when they didn't say ""Hey Google"". 

The plaintiffs argued that ""false accepts"", where the device mistakenly thinks it heard the wake word, led to the recording of sensitive discussions about finances, employment, and personal lives, which were then allegedly used to serve targeted advertisements. 

While Google denies any wrongdoing and insists Assistant only listens when activated, they agreed to the payout to avoid a risky jury trial. The settlement covers anyone who purchased a Google Assistant-enabled device (phones, Home speakers, tablets) since May 18, 2016.

*Did You Know?*

* **The ""False Accept"" Mechanism:** The core of the lawsuit isn't just that it recorded, but *why*. The plaintiffs claimed Google's algorithms were too aggressive, interpreting random noises or similar-sounding phrases as ""hot words"" to maximize data collection, effectively turning the devices into always-on bugs.
* **Apple Did It Too:** This isn't an isolated incident. Apple just settled a nearly identical lawsuit regarding **Siri** for **$95 million**. Those payments started going out this month (January 2026), with users receiving between $8 and $40 depending on how many devices they owned.
* **The Lawyer Tax:** Don't expect a huge windfall. Class counsel is requesting up to **33%** of the fund (approx. $22.7 million) for legal fees. With millions of eligible users, the individual payout for this Google settlement will likely be less than the price of a coffee.
* **Human Reviewers:** One of the most disturbing revelations from similar investigations (like the 2019 leaks) was that ""false accept"" recordings weren't just processed by AI—they were often listened to by **human contractors** to ""grade"" the transcription accuracy, meaning a stranger may have actually heard your private moments.

1qozc2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxietypilled/comments/1qozc2g/my_girlfriend_is_the_creator_of_the_universe/,My girlfriend is the creator of the universe,"Katie, my girlfriend, asked me to write this story of our relationship. She wanted me to call it *The Gospel of Scott*.

Even though I delivered her message like she asked, and even though I suffered so terribly for doing it, I still don't feel like my story should be elevated to the level of a religious text. So I'm just calling it what it is: my girlfriend is literally God. 

I met her at The Anchor. I was working my way through the crowd to get to the bar when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned around to see who it was. I wish I could say I had an ""I see the light"" style religious experience when I saw her. But truthfully, my first thoughts were 90% lust and 10% total shock that someone so beautiful had chosen me to talk to.

She was short, athletic, and super-cute. Her dark brown hair framed a beaming face that suggested a complicated mix of genes from Asia, Africa, and South America.

""Get me one of whatever you're having!""

""Beer okay?""

""As long as you're having one too!""

I know this isn't exactly the sort of exchange you'd expect between a mortal and The Lord of the universe. The problem is that our expectations about the cosmos are a bit off. Religion. Physics. Philosophy. Each of these systems of ideas kind-of misses the mark regarding what reality actually is.

Of course, that night in the bar, I had no idea that I had just met the one God, ruler of the universe. I was just giddy over the possibility that my lonely Friday night could include hanging out with this seriously beautiful woman. How could I have known that I would eventually become her prophet? And her martyr.

I managed to push my way to the bar, get two Guinnesses and wind my way back to her. ""I'm Katie,"" she said as she took one of the beers.

""I'm Scott."" My social anxiety kicked in at that moment and all words left me. My brain refused to come up with anything to say next. I started to sweat.

She smiled. If there was a religious experience to be had that night, it happened then. Her smile melted away my mental block. Suddenly I felt like I had known her forever and I wanted to tell her about my entire life. About every random thing that ever happened to me. Every stupid thought I've ever had.

I babbled about the time I missed the bus in third grade. My grandma's funeral. The first day of my first job after graduation. Losing my virginity. We moved from the crowded first floor of The Anchor to a quiet corner upstairs and I babbled some more. After a few more drinks, we left the bar and hung out in a coffee shop down the street.

I remember finishing my cappuccino and looking into the cup. The bubbles of the last bits of milk foam were slowly popping. I stopped talking for a moment to watch the little blob of foam at the bottom of the mug shrink into a tiny puddle of milk. It was only then, hours after I bought the first beers in The Anchor, that I realized I'd been talking nonstop.

""I'm so sorry!"" I blurted out. ""I've just been rambling for hours, you must be so sick of hearing every damn thing that's ever passed through my mind.""

""Scott. I could listen to you all night."" She smiled then reached across the table and grabbed my hand. ""I could do anything with you all night.""

Katie is sitting next to my bed as I'm writing this and she just told me that I ""should write down *everything* we did the evening we met. In extreme detail. Every position. Every kink.""

""We want people to actually read this,” she told me. “It's important. So why not throw in a bunch of sex? You know, to make sure my message is spread as widely as possible.""

She has a point. But I'm too shy to write down literally everything we did. Since this is my story. My gospel, as she calls it, I'm just going to say that we went back to my place and spent the night doing pretty-much everything that a man and a woman can do to please each other.

We stayed in bed together for most of the next day. She came over the next night too. By the end of the week, we were seeing each other every day

Whenever I'm in her presence, even now - in this ICU bed - I feel like I'm drunk on happiness. I babble and blather like a fool. Amazingly, she pays attention to me.

But in all my blathering during those first weeks of our relationship, I hardly ever asked her about herself. Only twice in those early days, before she revealed herself to me, did I probe her for information about herself.

""Katie, if you want, I can drive you home. Uh, wherever that is.""

""Ha! I don't need a ride. I kind-of live everywhere, you know?"" I didn't know what she meant. But I didn't pull on that thread either. I was just too happy and too afraid to discover something that would make it all end.

A few days later, I asked if I could drop her off at work when I drove to the office.

""I work from home.""

""I've never seen you work."" Even in my love-struck stupor, I still managed to get to the office and even answer a few work emails from my apartment in the evenings.

""I make my own hours.""

Katie insists that she didn't do any mind tricks on me to make me overlook these things that normally would be fairly obvious red flags. No home that she would tell me about or show me. No obvious job. I was drunk on love, and rational thought wasn't exactly in my skill-set. My state of euphoria ended the weekend I drove us to the lake.

The lake is about a three-hour drive out-of-town. Up in the mountains there’s a beautiful lake with a state park that’s got a beach, a boat rental, a nice restaurant, and some cabins you can rent. I splurged and rented one of the cabins by the beach. Yes - it was super-romantic, in case you’re wondering.

Our first night there, we were cuddling on the bed.

""Let's go canoeing,"" she whispered.

""It's midnight. The boat rental desk is closed.""

""Let's steal a boat!""

She leapt out of bed and quickly threw on her shorts and one of my T-shirts. ""Let's go! We’ll pull-off a heist!""

By the time I got dressed and tiptoed out the door of our mini-cottage, Katie was already on the beach, crouching next to the lock securing the ends of the steel cable that secured the small fleet of rental boats to a tree.

""Got it!"" she whisper-shouted to me. ""Grab two paddles.""

I grabbed a pair of paddles and we quietly moved one of the rental canoes to the water. She got in the bow, I pushed the boat into the water and scrambled into the stern.

We paddled stealthily to the center of the lake. There was no wind, and the water was glassy smooth. Tree-covered hills rose sharply from the shoreline, illuminated by the full moon. We stopped paddling and drifted together in silence.

She finally spoke.

""There's something I need to tell you.""

I closed my eyes. Something bad was coming. She was going to dump me.

""Go ahead.""

""I'm God.""

My eyes shot open. It wasn't the bad news I was expecting her to give me. But it wasn't good, either. ""You're ... what?""

""God. I created the universe. It was me.""

""You mean metaphorically. Like a woman's womb creates life so you're a goddess, or something like that.""

""No. I mean it literally. I'm God. The one and only God. Don’t worry - It's not that big a deal. It's not like I'm dumping you.""

I stared at her for a minute. She was grinning with the weird mixture of mischief and hilarity that made me love her so much. Maybe, I thought, the reason I found her energy and her radiant personality so unique and captivating was because she was suffering badly from a mental illness. Bipolar disorder, maybe. I had met her in a period of mania. I closed my eyes again.

Whatever was wrong with her, I decided, I didn't care. In that moment in the stolen canoe, I imagined the rest of my life with her. Whatever struggles with her illness lay in front of us. Whatever terrible moments we would share, I was up for it. I was ready to be with her forever no matter what.

""Katie, I-""

She cut me off. ""Touch the top of that hill."" She pointed. ""The tall one on the west side of the lake. Just reach out and touch it.""

""It's two miles away.""

""Come on. Just do it! Humor me.""

I extended my arm in the direction of the far-away hilltop. My hand grew as I moved it away from my body. Or maybe the hill shrank. Whatever it was, space and distance *changed*. Reaching towards the thousand foot hill two miles from the canoe was no different than reaching towards a miniature model in a model train set. You know those dumb tourist photographs, the kind where someone near the camera poses to make it look like they're touching something far away - like they're holding up the leaning tower of Pisa or something or touching the top of the pyramids at Giza. As long as the foreground and background are in focus, the illusion works.

My hand and the hilltop looked like one of those tricks with perspective. Except, I *actually* touched the top of the hill. My fingers, now somehow made gigantic compared to the trees on the hill, felt the branches and limbs like bristles on a broom.

I snatched my hand back. It shrank back to its normal size as I pulled back from the hilltop. My heart was pounding. Over the course of about fifteen seconds, I went from thinking I was being dumped by the love of my life, to thinking she was suffering from a serious mental illness, to thinking I was the one with the mental health issue.

""What did you do?"" I didn't mean to sound like I was accusing her, but I was wound up, and starting to get scared. ""How did you make me ... reach that far?""

She carefully slipped off her seat in the front of the canoe and crawled towards me. I backed away from her, fell backwards off the stern seat and collapsed into the awkward space between the seat and the rear of the boat. The canoe rocked dangerously.

She rose and walked the last few steps to the stern seat. Somehow, the boat remained stable despite my falling and her walking. ""It's okay."" She offered me her hand and helped me stand up. ""Turn around,"" she said.

I turned around and she wrapped her arms around my chest. ""Look at the moon,"" she said.

I looked at the moon. A full moon in a perfectly cloudless sky painted the lake and the hills with silver light. ""Now reach out and touch it.""

I started shaking. She gave me squeeze and I calmed down a little. I raised my right arm. The moon looked like a glowing golf ball next to my outstretched hand. I moved my hand in front of the moon and slowly closed my fingers. I grasped ... something. There was a small, cold, round object in my palm!

I relaxed my grip and stroked it with my fingertips. It was rough, like sandpaper. There were a few irregular dimples. Craters and mountains? Was I really touching the moon? If so, that meant my hand was somehow - I don’t know - thousands of miles across. I didn’t like the idea of being so massive. 

""Is this safe?"" I asked. ""What if I, like, shift its orbit? Couldn't that unleash huge tsunamis or earthquakes?""

""It's safe because I'm here with you.""

""I'm not going to mess it up, am I? I can't accidentally flatten mountains or put my fingerprints on huge parts of the surface?""

""Don't worry.""

I continued to stroke the moon. The friggin’ moon! ""What is this? How are you doing this?"" My voice was loud and shaky again.

""Well. It's a little complicated. But, since I'm literally God, it's not that hard to pull off. I just arranged some highly improbable quantum tunneling events, and some unlikely positional modalities.""

""Why do you keep saying you're God?"" It was a dumb question. But fear and confusion kept me deep in low-IQ territory.

""Because I am. And I'm going to keep saying it until you wrap your brain around it. Let go of the moon. I want you to feel something else.""

I brought my hand back to Earth. I stared at it - now it was just a normal hand.

""Reach out past the moon. Deep into space.""

I stretched upwards again, sending my hand past the moon, into the darkness of the night sky. It was cold. Colder than the moon. But I felt small pinpricks of heat on my wrist and forearm.

""You're feeling the stars,"" Katie said. ""Reach even farther into space""

I did as I was told. At first I felt nothing but more cold. Then there was a tingling warmth in my fingertips. Like I stuck my hand into a warm shower.

""You are feeling the farthest galaxies from us. The very edge of the universe. Use your left hand to feel the other side.""

I pushed my left hand into the sky, feeling the coldness of space, the heat of the stars, and eventually, the tingling glow of the clouds of countless galaxies.

""Your reach is spanning the universe. You've got the entirety of existence in your arms. Do you know what that means?""

I nodded no.

""It means this is the first time you've hugged me. Not this little human form of me in the boat, but the true me. We are embracing each other for the first time.""

She was quiet for a long time. I imagined everything that was between my hands. The impossible number of stars, and planets. It was all her.

""Now, I want you to do one more thing. Stretch even further out. Push your fingertips just a little further away. Past the warmth of the cloud of galaxies.""

I straightened my arms completely. I pushed my fingers through the warmth into whatever was beyond the universe.

My fingertips burned. And froze. They lit up with pain, but also seemed to disappear from my awareness at the same time.

“What is this? What is happening?”

The non-existence beyond the edge of the universe grabbed me. I felt it pulling my arms in both directions. The sensations shooting down the nerves in my arm made no sense. Pain, colors, sound, hate, beauty, mindlessnes. I was touching pure chaos. A disorder so profound that time and logic evaporated.

I reflexively tried to yank my hands back into the universe. The chaos beyond held them firm. I could feel my fingers merging with the chaos. Pulses of disordered energy, effects with no cause and events outside of time oozed up my arms. Chaos and disorder greedily invading the universe through my body.

""Help me!"" I screamed.

Katie squeezed me tight. ""Try to pull away again again.""

I pulled hard and the terrible madness spreading into my body slowly reversed its flow. My wrists emerged from the cloud of disorder, then my palms, then my fingertips. I collapsed backwards and Katie helped me sit back on the canoe seat.

""Now you know what I do for my day job,"" she said. ""I create reality from the void.""

“The void,” I said absently. My mind was no longer hooked up to my mouth.

“There’s no experience in the void - no mind can exist there. No love can exist there.”

She stepped backwards to the center of the canoe. I turned around to face her. The boat was unusually stable, given that we were standing in it.

My mind was racing. This is God. She's God. I'm with God. I'm dating God. I had *sex* with God.

""Katie, I'm not religious. I mean, I wasn't until just now. Um. Am I supposed to kneel? Or pray? Or cross myself? Or something like that?""

""Not exactly."" She pulled off her T-shirt and dropped it into the boat. ""I want you to make love to me."" She slipped her shorts off. ""Not in the boat though. On the lake.""

She stepped out of the boat and stood next to it. For her, the surface of the water was solid. ""Come on,"" she said, holding out her hand.

I stripped, took her hand and stepped out of the canoe. The boat didn't rock at all. I stood on the surface of the lake. The water gave a little as I put my weight on it, like I was walking on a trampoline. She led me away from the boat. I followed, walking with careful, bouncy steps. My heart was pounding.I started gasping for breath.

“Katie - or My Lord. Or -”

“Just Katie. I’m still me.”

“I don’t know if I can, you know -” I looked down at myself. Terror and romance don’t exactly mix well for me.

“Sure you can.” She grinned slyly. “Your lord commands it!” she said in a tone of mock authority. Then she started laughing hysterically. I eventually started laughing too. Then we lay down on the surface of the lake, and took the idea of walking on water to a whole new, adult-rated level.

I was awakened before dawn by a bird landing on my ankle. I was still lying on the surface of the lake. Katie was asleep next to me. At, least, she *looked like* she was asleep. But she’s God, so who knows. The bird regarded me for a moment, then flew off. I woke up Katie and we walked back across the surface of the lake to the canoe. We got dressed, climbed into the boat and paddled back to the beach.

Katie ran the security cable through the boat’s handle and locked it back in place. “I hope we don’t get in trouble for stealing the boat.”

“What do you care? You’re friggin God.” The panic and extreme disorientation of the night before was coming back to me. 

“You don’t know how this works, do you?”

“How what works?”

“The cosmos. Buy me breakfast and I’ll tell you all about it.”

We walked back to our rented mini-cabin, showered, dressed and made our way to the restaurant in the main lodge.

“Okay,” Katie said. “These eggs are pretty good.”

“But the universe. How it all works. The void. Why the hell you’re dating me?”

She put down her fork and smiled at me. ""Subatomic particles. They wiggle, you know. Jump around. Take your average electron or quark. At each instant it's in a new place. And you can't really predict where it'll be next. It could be here, it could be over there. Now here’s the thing though. Are you going to eat your toast?""

I put my toast onto her plate. “What’s the thing?”

She took three huge bits of toast. Slowly chewed and swallowed. “This is great toast.”

“The thing? About subatomic particles?”

“Right. Each time a particle moves, the universe *branches*. It branches big time. There’s a whole new parallel universe created for each possible place that particle could be. There’s zillions of new parallel universes created every instant.”

“That seems like an unreasonable number of universes,” I said. “There must be billions created every nanosecond just from the matter in your fork.”

“Trillions. And multiply that by all the matter and energy everywhere. Trillions of trillions of trillions of new worlds branching off this one each instant. And the same number again branching off of each of those.”

“I don't want to throw shade on your creation, but that seems like an awful lot of universes.”

“Yeah. Well, I guess I just like universes. Most of them end up getting recycled by the void. All but one, actually, are gobbled up by the randomness.”

“Just one universe out of all the possible ones survives?”

“Yes, the universe that I choose to experience is the one that sticks around. I *choose* which universe I want to experience. Which branch of the tree of branching realities to call home. That's what reality is. The particular branch of the hyper-expanding tree of universes that I choose to experience.”

She finished the toast. Then ordered more eggs and two servings of hash browns.

We stayed at the lake for another two days. Katie said I acted pretty weird towards her during that time. She’s totally right. I tried to worship her for a few hours (“stop,” she said. “It’s really annoying when you do that”). I tried to get her to do more cool God-tricks - turn the toilet into gold or make me twelve feet tall. Stuff like that. (“Scott, I’m pretty sure you’d hate it if you were twelve feet tall.”) I asked her about the dinosaurs (“Yeah, they were pretty cool.”) and the big bang (“it was neato, you know.”). 

“Look,” she finally told me. “I make reality, right. Like, I’m making it right now. And the reality I want is the one where we’re just a normal couple. For now. In fact, I want to move in with you.”

“Of course. I can help you move your stuff in.”

“I don’t have any stuff. I don’t even have my own place.”

“You’re homeless? You’re God! Why not make a mansion? Or a palace?”

“The universe is my house. I’m comfortably at home wherever I am.”

Katie didn’t see the point in somehow magic-ing up a bunch of money either. After she moved in, I still went to work every day. Still paid rent and bills. Still filled my car with gas. I even bought her new clothes - a few pairs of  jeans and some T-shirts.

She was God, so she got what she wanted. A basically normal romantic relationship.

A few weeks after she moved in, Katie came with me to an after-work happy hour. Watching her make casual small-talk with my oblivious co-workers was both hilarious and frustrating. She chatted with Ken, my devout Christian boss, about craft beer. What would he do if he learned that Katie was the deity who he had devoted his life to worshiping? 

I was still thinking about Ken on the way home, ""You met my boss, Ken. You talked about craft beer, remember. He’s a super-devout Christian.""

""I know.""

""So, you're who he worships, right? Like the bible. And that stuff?""

""That stuff.” She laughed, “You mean *Christianity*?""

""Okay, yes. Ken is, how do I say this, directing his energy to the right deity?""

""Not exactly.""

""So, like, Jesus. Ten commandments. Noah-""

""Let's just say that I chose a path through all possible universes to one where the Bible exists.""

Two weeks after the happy hour, I came home from work to find Katie waiting for me in a black business suit. I had never seen that outfit before. It certainly wasn't one that I bought her.

""Scott,"" she said in an atypically serious tone. ""I love you. Which is why I chose you for this. I have to ask you to do me a favor. It's kind-of a biggie.”

“Anything.” I meant it.

“I'm going on a business trip soon. Before I go, I want you to communicate a message to everyone.”

“I thought you *were* the universe. You are everything everywhere. Where are you going?”

“I have urgent business outside of anything that you can comprehend. Don’t worry, I’ll be back”

“When?”

“A couple trillion years.”

I collapsed onto the sofa. Tears filled my eyes. 

She sat down next to me. “You don’t have to wait that long, though. You’ll be with me soon. After you deliver my message.”

I didn’t like the sound of that. *I’ll be with her soon*, outside of anything that I can comprehend. But I love her. And also, she’s the boss, you know. “What is the message?”

She stood and walked to the kitchen counter. She picked up a sharpie and a piece of cardboard that appeared to be a ripped-off side of a large cardboard box. She uncapped the marker and wrote these words on the cardboard:



GOD IS NOT COMING TO HELP US

SO

WE HAVE TO HELP EACH OTHER

  


“This message is going to piss a lot of people off,” she said. “But everyone needs to know this. And this message has to come from you.”

“Why does it have to come from me? I mean, you could paint it in the sky with hundred-mile-high flaming letters. An unambiguous message from God!”

“Well, maybe. But the point is that I’m not going to be around. So proving that I *am* around as part of saying I’m not will be pretty confusing for folks. I need a prophet. And that’s you.”

“So, I … what?” I was still crying a little and I wiped my nose on my sleeve. “I walk around with this sign?” 

“No. I want you to *stand* around with this sign. At major intersections downtown. Do it 16 hours a day until you can’t do it anymore.”

So I did.

The next morning I called in sick to work and walked to the end of the off-ramp where the interstate dumps traffic downtown. Tens of thousands of cars pour through that intersection every day.

Drivers began honking at me almost as soon as I arrived at the pedestrian island in the middle of the intersection. I studied their faces as they drove by to try to figure out if they were honking in support or anger. I soon learned the “language” of car honking. Two or three quick toots of the horn is a sign of support. Some of these “toot-toot” drivers gave me thumbs-up signs as they passed me. A long, single blast of the horn signifies anger. Rage, even. The longer the driver lays on the horn, the more likely I was to also get a middle finger or even a shouted curse as they drove by. The angry horn blasts outnumbered the friendly toot-toots by at least nine to one.

What were they so mad at? The second sentence on my sign just said that we have to help each other. That seemed benign. I guess it was the first sentence that was the problem: *God is not coming to help us*. Even though the message was directly from God herself, and completely true, most of the people who passed through the intersection that day were not ready to hear it.

Standing in the intersection, getting stared at, honked at, and yelled at was stressful and embarrassing. When would someone I knew drive through the intersection and recognize me? 

After lunch, I experienced a new and much worse type of humiliation. At around 1:30 pm, seven hours into my “shift,” someone in a pickup screamed “burn in hell, atheist” and threw a paper soda cup at me. The supersized cup of coke hit me in the chest. It was half-full of ice and it *hurt* when it hit me. The soda splashed into my eyes and soaked my shirt.

The paper cup resting at my feet must have been a subliminal clue to the rest of the drivers that day. Ten more people threw drinks at me. I managed to dodge a few of them, but most of them hit me - more icy soda, a hot coffee, and an empty Sprite can.

When I returned to my apartment around midnight, I was thoroughly soaked, cold, and bruised. My apartment was dark and empty. Katie was not home. I peeled my wet clothes off and took a shower. The hot water warmed my skin, but inside, I felt colder than ever. Had Katie left for her “business trip” already? The trip that would last a few trillion years? I missed her already, just a few hours after I saw her last. How could I go on for the rest of my life without her? I wept.

There was a galaxy in my bedroom when I finally got out of the shower.

A beautiful, purplish-blueish spiral galaxy floated above my bed, slowly rotating around its center point. I approached and examined it closely. Clouds of stars looked like glowing wisps of smoke. I bent in even closer and saw beautifully colored nebula floating throughout like tiny blobs of watercolor. There was a post-it note on the bed.

*Great job at the intersection today. Keep going out there every day until you can’t anymore. I’m running an errand before my business trip. I’ll be back to see you one more time before I leave. I didn’t have cash to buy flowers, so here’s a galaxy instead.*

I slept under the galaxy and woke early the next morning. I put on a raincoat to protect myself from thrown drinks, grabbed the cardboard sign and headed back to the intersection.

The community of drivers in the city learns quickly. On only my second day at the intersection, I received my first thrown soda-cup at 9:30am. It seemed like everyone who saw me getting drenched as they drove through the intersection yesterday decided it would be fun to participate themselves today. The raincoat helped a little, but the volume of liquid thrown at me was much greater than yesterday, and I was soon soaked with diverse fluids.

The second day ended with me stumbling through the door of my dark, lonely apartment, showering, then falling asleep under the floating galaxy. I woke up early again and repeated the process. Again. And again. And again.

I became some kind of perverse institution in the downtown business district. Every few minutes someone would throw garbage or liquid on me as they drove by. Pedestrians shoved me as they walked across the road. I was spit on daily. Screamed at every few hours. “God helps those with faith!” “Godless atheist!” That sort of thing.  

Six weeks after I started holding Katie’s sign, someone in the back seat of black pickup casually lobbed a brick at me. The light had been green for a while, and the truck was moving through the intersection at about 45 miles per hour.  I only saw the brick for a moment. It was just a dark shape flying towards me. I had no time to react - the brick smashed into my face. The bridge of my nose was basically liquified. The bone of my eye-sockets shattered and my eyes were simultaneously smashed by the brick and sliced by the displaced shards of my skull.

I didn’t lose consciousness. Instead, I lay on the ground and screamed for help. I started choking on the blood pouring into my throat from my mutilated sinuses. I stopped screaming and just focused on breathing. Help did not come. I heard nothing but the traffic zipping past me for five or ten minutes. I must have looked just like a drunk passed out on the sidewalk - something nobody trying to get to work is going to want to deal with. I sat up and waved my arms for help - hoping somebody would notice my smashed face. This finally got someone’s attention. A car’s emergency brake engaged. Door opening. “Oh shit, pal. I got you. I just called 911. Hang in there. I got you.”

“My sign!” I choked on blood and was completely unintelligible. I tried again. “My sign! I need my sign. God gave it to me!” My samaritan put the piece of cardboard into my hands. “Brother, I don’t think that sign is doing you much good today.”

I was in the hospital for twenty days. Three surgeries. Nothing but bad news from the doctors. My eyes were irretrievably gone. My skull and sinuses would require a series of elaborate reconstructive surgeries just to restore normal breathing function. 

The police visited once. They were profoundly uninterested in my case. “You were out there every day, all day, holding a deliberately provocative sign. What did you expect?”

I checked myself out against doctors’ orders. The hospital was only a few blocks from “my” intersection. Now blind, finding my way, even just over three blocks, was a terrifying challenge. 

I somehow made it back to the pedestrian island without getting run over. I stood, wobbly but upright, and held the sign, now crusty from dried blood and whatever other thrown liquids it absorbed. I stayed there. It was my job. Katie told me to do it, so that’s what I did.

I didn’t try to return to my apartment - the idea of trying to get myself across town while blind was too much for me to contemplate. I slept on the pedestrian island. I begged for food when I heard pedestrians walk past. Sometimes someone would give me something - half a granola bar. The unfinished portion of a sandwich. A bottle of water.

I lost count of the days. It may have been three weeks or a month. The weather grew colder, and it rained a few times. One night, late, I finally managed to doze off. I was startled awake by something splashing on me. Not just a cup of soda or old coffee. Someone dumped a whole bucketful of liquid on me. 

My sense of smell was gone - another one of my senses completely destroyed by the brick. But even with no sense of  smell, I could taste the fumes from the liquid - gasoline.

A man’s voice said. “We don’t want to wait to see you burn in Hell, atheist. So we’re gonna burn you now!” I heard laughing, not just from the speaker but at least two other people with him.

Then I burned. The gasoline had soaked into every piece of clothing I wore. Into the dirty bandages that covered my eyes. Into Katie’s sign. *Engulfed*. That’s the word people use to describe something that is completely on fire. We throw it around casually. How often does a local news anchor use that word during a broadcast? Weekly? “Engulfed in flames.” It just rolls off the tongue.

Now it was my turn to be engulfed. I rolled desperately, and futility, to extinguish myself. There was too much fuel. Too much heat. Nothing helped. I heard nothing but the rush of air and hot gasses combining around me. I inhaled to scream and the flames entered my lungs. Panic. Pain. Terror. Sorrow that my life was ending. Pain. I rolled again, and fell off the curb into the street. The fuel was eventually consumed, and the roar of my own pyre diminished. I heard laughing. Then running away. 

A car stopped next to me. A woman screamed. Someone beat me with a piece of clothing or a blanket - I must have still been on fire. There was a woosh from a fire extinguisher. Yelling. Crying. Sirens. Then, finally, unconsciousness.

""Scott, I'm here."" Katie whispered in my ear. I reached for her and she took what was left of my hand. “You did what I asked. What I needed you to do. Nobody knows it yet, but you did what humankind needed you to do. You. You are a savior in the most literal sense.”

""The doctors think I'm dying. They don’t actually say it, but I know it’s what they mean. I lost six fingers."" I would have cried, if I still had tear ducts left. “My foot. Katie, they had to take it off last night. I’m probably going to lose the other one too.”

“You will be rewarded.”

“Do you mean - in, like heaven?”

“Did you ever make yourself a shopping list?”

“What? Like, for milk and eggs and stuff?”

“Yes. Think about it. Why do you write down a list of what you need before you go shopping?”

“Well, it’s because I can’t remember more than just a few things. So it’s to remind me what to buy at the store.”

“That list on the little piece of paper. It helps you remember what to get. It is *literally* a little bit of your memory that exists outside of your head. It’s still your thoughts, right, about what to buy? It’s just not inside your skull. It leaves your skull when you write it down, then it goes back in when you look at it again.”

“Yes Katie, I know how lists work.”

“Well, suppose someone else gets the list. Maybe you gave it to them, or you dropped it and they picked it up and read it, it means that some tiny part of your mind briefly exists in another person. It’s not your whole self, obviously, far from it. But it’s not nothing.”

“Instead of the shopping list, think of everything you put into the world over a lifetime. All the things you’ve ever said to everyone, the pictures you’ve put on the Internet, and your tax returns and so on. When people see these and think about you, they’re not just thinking *about* you. They are, in some small way, using their minds to think *for* you. Your *self* is spread out over everyone who has ever been affected by your life in some way.”

“That’s a nice idea.”

“It’s not just a nice idea Scott. It’s physics. The physics I created, by-the-way. I made the universe this way for a reason. “What you did for me - holding that sign at the intersection - put a profound idea into a few people’s minds. A part of you is now alive in them. And as I look out into the future I see the near-infinity of time in which humans will exist in some form. I can see them, Scott, countless quintillions of individuals who will come after you. And I see that little piece of you in all of them. The message is already spreading. There’s a guy standing in an intersection in Detroit with the same sign. Next week someone new will stand at your intersection.”

“I’m going to live on with my mind smeared across the future of humanity?”

“Yes. It won’t feel the same as being alive, like you are now. But it’s not oblivion either. And it will feel wonderful. And I will be there with you.”

The next day, Katie came back to the ICU with a laptop. “Tell me your story. Tell it the way you want it told. I’ll write it down for you and put it into the world.”

So I did. I narrated all of this to Katie, from my bed. It took days. Interrupted by surgeries, and long spells of incoherence from the painkillers. But Katie stayed with me the whole time.

“I’ll be here with you until the end of this phase of your existence. Then you’ll be part of the universe.”

“Then you’ll go on your business trip.”

“I will leave humanity for a long time. They’ll be okay though, because of you.”

*\[Scott died at 9:56 yesterday morning. I’m posting his story here. I hope you will read it and encourage others to do so. I am leaving you now. I will not be here to help you, so you have to help each other. - Katie\]*

1qozb84,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1qozb84/my_stomach_issues_are_ruining_my_senior_year_of/,My stomach issues are ruining my senior year of college.,"My stomach issues are ruining my senior year of college.

I have been dealing with stomach issues, diagnosed as IBS, for over 2 years now, since my sophomore year of college. Before I started suffering from IBS symptoms, my stomach wasn’t great either, as I experienced a lot of nausea and stomach aches. Throughout college, I have been on various SSRIs for depression and anxiety and tried different forms of birth control, two different pills, and a hormonal IUD, which I just recently had removed. I also had an intense caffeine addiction for years, drinking coffee almost every single day and constantly drinking energy drinks. 

Caffeine was the first thing that I noticed that really triggered my stomach. At first it was coffee, but I was dependent on caffeine that I switched to energy drinks or making my own chai lattees. Those then began to hurt my stomach, and I tried a couple different types of energy drinks, matcha, caffeinated soda, until eventually I had to stop completely. Whenever I would find something that worked and didn’t upset my stomach, eventually my stomach grew sensitive to it to the point where I couldn’t drink anything caffeinated. Being in college, not drinking any caffeine has been extremely difficult.

This past fall, my stomach issues got extremely worse, and I was genuinely scared and thought something was seriously wrong. One day, my stomach started feeling incredibly upset, I was bloated, felt nauseous, and overall felt like I had a very sour stomach. I ended up having to leave campus early and felt sick for several days. To be completely TMI, I was experiencing nothing but yellow, liquid diarrhea and gas, causing me to run to the bathroom nonstop. I had no control over it and was in a lot of pain. I went to urgent care, and they suspected that I had diverticulitis. They gave me an antibiotic for it, and told me to avoid popcorn and things with seeds. The antibiotic helped immensely, but it didn’t go away completely. For almost a month straight, all I ate was sourdough bread, chicken, rice, canned peaches, and applesauce, but I didn’t feel better.

When nothing got better, I called my cousin, who was a doctor, and she told me to go on the low-FODMAP diet. I also had a stool test and bloodwork done with my primary care doctor, and everything came up negative. I then saw a GI, who ordered a colonoscopy, another stool test, and a breath test for SIBO. Everything came up negative. I haven’t been able to work in any foods to my low FODMAP diet, because anytime I try anything that is moderate or high FODMAP, my stomach hurts, and I experience diarrhea. I also experience constipation, and I would say it goes back and forth. I also would say that I have about two weeks out of every month in which, no matter what I eat, my stomach is upset, due to my period and being pre-menstrual.

Before September, I would have normal bowel movements unless something triggered my IBS. I was pretty sure my triggers were gluten and caffeine, but I hadn’t really cut them out of my diet; I was just dealing with the symptoms. Now I can’t eat anything that isn’t low-FODMAP at all, and it has been months. I haven’t had a day with a single normal bowel movement since September.  I have said no to a lot of things this year because my stomach has hurt, I’ve been exhausted, or I just know I can’t eat or drink anything out with friends. I have had to stop taking my ADHD medication and go off of birth control to completely eliminate anything that could upset my stomach.

My doctors have not been able to find anything, and it is driving me crazy. I just want an answer so I can be a normal college student again, and I don’t have very long left. I have asked my GI to re-test me for SIBO, because for a while I was convinced that’s what it was, but she told me she wasn’t going to order another test. If anyone has any insight on what I should do, things I should try, please let me know. I want to try anything, but at the same time, I don’t want to self-treat with the wrong thing and make myself worse. 

If anyone has any insight, I would really appreciate it. I want to get my life back.",1,1769568851.0,ibs,1,1.0,False

Annoyingly, it's too long to be posted all at once, so I'm posting the first half here and the second half later!

**The Sheriff, The Indian, and The Devil Pt. 1**

The man groggily sat in the ice. The wet snow crunched under his gruff and scar etched hands. His blood-soaked mouth opened and closed with each deep breath. His black eyes opened towards the endless sky. Not a cloud. No birds. Nothing to aid his lonesome existence on that mountain. The tattered clothes upon his chest blew and flapped in the gusts that passed over him. Sharp needles of ice clung along his brow, and he shivered, for there was no warmth there. No life around or in him. 

Among him lay all the starved and dead of his posse. Blood painted the canvas that was the snow mountain, creating a garish artwork no being could stomach. Either mortal or other. The log cabin that had been their Elysium from the endless cold now lay barren and smoking. Wood charred. 

There was a woman there from before. Dying of starvation and whatever pestilence came upon this misery-stricken venture. The man wondered what became of her. Lying still and quiet in the housefire. She was pregnant, if he remembered right: almost at the point of the due date. Had she lived long enough to see the baby out? Or had it died within her when her own soul was released from this place? Her body lay there as the flames engulfed the cabin. Lying there with her soft and peaceful expression as her skin began to melt in the flame and the heat of the hellfire that was coming. The baby cooked in a soup of her embryonic fluid as it boiled and turned over within her.

But he knew it lived. And he had heard it scream from the house as it carried its mother off from this place. What became of it? Who would it become? How could this creature, which was so dependent upon the bosom of the thing that had given it life, no longer having life itself, live? It didn’t. He knew it didn’t. But what did he know?  Where was George?

Look at him. The man. Kneeling deep in viscera and gore. Living off it. He finds a body near him. It’s a man. He grips the ankle. He feels his nails begin to grow longer, and it is painful. His teeth grow longer and wilder, and his eyes begin to bulge out of his head. His bones begin to crack, and his skin breaks across his back as he becomes taller. He’s growing taller and taller. His arms are reaching his knees, and he is a giant. A Nephilim. The sons of God and the daughters of man. What unholy abomination is this? His clothes rip, and he lets out a shriek foreign to any human being. But he is. He is still a man. He knows. He has the memories, though they become more and more foggy. 

Where’s George? George can fix this. He can fix him.

He tears flesh away from the ankle, revealing the Achilles tendon. Blood seeps further into the snow. Drools of paint. The man stuffs the flesh and the meat from the dead thing into his mouth. It tastes horrendous, but he is starving. He is insatiable like he never was before. And he is cold. He shivers, but as the flesh travels down into his stomach, he feels a momentary warmth. He needs more warmth. He needs more flesh. 

He grabs more of the man's leg and rips off more flesh. It tastes horrible, but it gives warmth, and it gives momentary satiation from starvation. He travels up the man, taking chunks of viscera. First from the leg, then from the back, he travels up and up the body of this thing that lies dead at his feet. And as he reaches the face, he makes contact with the eyes of the dead thing. The eyes of an old man. He studies the rest of the face. And before he realizes, his eyes are full of tears, and he is weeping. He, the creature, is weeping and stumbling away. And as he stumbles, she trips over more. More women, more men. More people he once knew, but now they are all dead things. Like a bird. Like a deer. Nothing more. 

He stumbles into a lake of ice. An endless mass of vast and frozen water. Unending before him and behind him, the remnants of his last hope. The creature falls to his knees and begins to wail. Wail for God. Wail for something, anything to grant him freedom from this place. And in between his incessant sobs, he hears another cry. Another one far away yet close to his own sorrow. It is the cry of a child. 

January 16th, 1888

I ain’t too sure what the town’s to do about this durn predicament we’ve found ourselves in. Mrs. Mary Tillit. Mauled to death in her own home.

Said that the paper boy found her in the morning. The door to her lil home blown way open, and the ol boy, I think only thirteen, found the woman face down in her bed. Said it stunk in a real bad way. Lady looked like she was sleeping, though. He said he called her name a few times, and she didn’t respond. Thought about lifting the covers, but he didn’t want confirmation to his nightmare, so he ran. Smart boy, really. 

Once I got there, the whole town was in a big commotion. People all crowding around the place. Found a straggler in the house, too, and he booked it real quick when he saw me coming. Found Doctor Pello in the room with the woman, examining her. She was in real bad shape. Didn’t even think I could stomach it. The thing, whatever it was, had opened up her whole chest cavity. Blood soaked the sheet, and her ribs had been cracked and broken as the thing pried her chest open. She had an intestine hanging limply off the bed, and her organs were all cut. Doc didn’t know what to make of it. Neither did I. Just sat looking at her. Doctor said her entire heart had been ripped out.

 I think the last time I had seen her alive was at church that Sunday. Charming girl. Young. Whole life ahead. She was married, too. James Tillit is her husband’s name. He’s gone now on a business trip. Word is that he gets back tomorrow. I don't quite know how I’m to explain the situation to him.

Who did that to her? What in God’s name killed that girl? No wolf could’ve done that. I can’t think of what did. I’m not sure I want to. God help us. 

January 17th, 

Met James today. One of my deputies gave me word on where he was, and I rode out to meet his stagecoach. Gave him the news. Boy didn’t believe it. I’m not sure I can either. I brought him back to the station. Filled him in on everything that we know. The little of it there is. He informed us about some of her personal life. Apparently, she was pregnant.

We asked James if he knew what could’ve done it. Who could've done it? He didn’t know. I said it was all alright, and well, we took him down to Pello’s to see the body. We showed it to ‘em on the cold table. Ol boy looked like he’d seen a ghost. I had to catch him from falling over. Can’t blame him none. Left him there to talk with Pello and get burial things ready. 

Fore I left, I did pull the Doc over to have a chat. I’d asked him if he had any evidence for the girl to have been pregnant, and he had told me that he did. And that the baby was missing. Seemingly taken when poor girl was killed. 

Tillit came down to my house tonight. Knocked on the door, and before I could answer, he barged in. 

“Sir,” He said, “I have felt the deepest parts of sorrow and grief beyond any comparison.” He sat on the seat near the fire. “My dearest Mary has been ravaged by someone, and that man has disappeared. Seemingly gone with the wind and the waves of the ocean. I beg you, Sheriff, when you find the devil that did this. Let me carry out the vengeance of the Lord on him. Let me look him in the eyes as I put a bullet in between.”

He gazed at the fire, and the flickering flames reflected in his irises. It was as if his anger was embodied within him, along with a sorrow as deep and dark as the ocean depths. 

“Boy, the law will be carried out how the law is always carried out. I understand your sentiment, son, but I’m afraid I can’t let this play out. We will do what we must, but when the time comes for justice to be given, it shall be given by accordance with the law.”

He silently nodded and stared at the fire. 

We sat in my living room for a while. I went and boiled a pot and poured us both a cup of coffee. It was a long night. The only conversation between us a shared silence and an understanding glance. 

January 18th, 

I have begun to put together a hunting party. I contacted Ahanu. He’s on the way and hopefully can reach for us a good way to find the man. I am greatly indebted to Ahanu. Since he was a young boy, I have been indebted to him. 

I’ve gotten the inclination that James is going to be joining this party. I am urging him not to for fear that his emotions at this stage may just get the better of him. He’s a welcome addition if he so desires, but I must try to deter him. 

After investigations about the house, we have found some evidence as to the creature that committed this heinous act. Firstly, on closer inspection to the front door, we found some strange markings along the door frame. Claw marks of some kind. We can’t distinguish what manner of claws did that. No identifiable creature has those claw marks. Next, there was, along the floor, a path of mud. This trailed from the front door through the house, seemingly seeking for the girl. It bolted awkwardly and without form through the living room and through the kitchen. Looping on itself, lankily stumbling about. Strangely, the mud trail ended extremely suddenly at the eastern wall of the girl’s home. It seemed as though the thing simply vanished and entered into the wall. Now I wasn’t too sure, but after staring at that blank and empty wall, I noticed three small etchings in it. I studied it closely and noticed a trail reaching higher and higher. The trail of these marks followed along the wall and rose into the ceiling. These etchings entered Mrs. Tillit’s room and ended right above her bed. It was hard for us to notice initially, but those brown and bloodstained sheets were darkened not just by blood but bits of mud and solidified clay too. The thing climbed along the ceiling and dropped right on Mrs. Tillit when it attacked her. I ain’t too sure what to make of this thing. I don’t think it’s a man. But I’m scared to think of what it really is. 

No evidence has come about concerning witnesses or anything. We have tried receiving accounts of Mrs. Tillitt’s behavior the week before the murder, but so far, out of everyone around her, nothing was strange. The only note we’ve been given is from the drunk in the town square. Earl Edward. I’ve had many run-ins with him before. From the numerous bar fights the man has gotten himself into, to that time he drunkenly stole the local pastor’s horse and hightailed it for Cheyenne. We found him lying by a creek about 13 miles in the opposite direction from where he was trying to go. Fell off the horse in a drunken stupor. His poor old father goes for his bail each time. 

Anyway, Edward noted that he saw a tall and elongated man creaking around in the shadows around the girl's home. Said the thing dipped deep into a lumber pile. Now, under normal circumstances, I woulda told Edward that he was seeing things and that he was drunk, but after the brutality of the girl, I really don’t know what to believe. Earl said that when he saw the thing hide, he tried getting closer to investigate the lumber pile. Mary Tillit found him sneaking about and yelled at him for being a creep and threatened to call for me. In trying to explain himself, she yelled at him for being a drunk and threw him out of her place. That was the most believable part of his story. 

January 19th, 

Ahanu’s here. Much older than the last time I’ve met him. He’s grown a strong goatee and his frame is filled out. He has the strength of his ancestors within his arms and the will of the Bison within his soul. He’s very tall and his hair has been pulled back in a pony tail. A revolver and a silver knife hangs at his hip and a bow is strung across his chest. His worn shirt is missing a few buttons at the top and his arms are etched with scars from his youth and an impressive warband decorates his bicep. His dark complexion hides his eyes in a most peculiar way like he is in a state of perpetual brooding but when he speaks he speaks of his family at home and how things are faring with his people and the reservation. His voice carries a kind note and he expresses love and care for his people through his inflections and his smallest mannerisms. I really have missed this boy. 

I’ve informed him of all we know. The little there is. I’ve asked him for advice and what to do. I’ve also been in contact with Reverend Vanderbilt. He’s been with James Tillit the past few days. Tillit has been drinking himself under. Way under. I’m planning to meet him in a few days to inform him of any advances we’ve made in understanding what has happened to his wife. 

January 20th, 

God, what manner of thing is this?

Last night a child was attacked. It was the Stephens' boy. A five year old. He was found in the morning face down near the stream on his family’s ranch property. His body was mangled and destroyed. I cannot bring myself to describe the specifics of this horror. His mother is manic. I have no earthly idea what to do.

Ahanu inspected the area around the boy and he has found tracks that lead out into the woods near the edge of our little town. I asked him what type of tracks it was and he could not be certain. Said it seemed like an enlarged human foot. Longer and wider than possible. Deep claws in the mud. 

That afternoon Ahanu, a boy named Sean who was one of my deputies, and I, made a venture into the woods to try to find this thing’s quarters. When we reached the outskirts of the woods, right where the trees began, I had the feeling as if I had just stumbled through the Gates of Hell. Ahanu on my right held a double-barreled shotgun as we weaved our way through the branches and the leaves. I kept my hand near my holster. The crunch of fallen branches and leaves the only sound made in that place. Ahanu stooped down every now and then to regain the path of the trail and we slowly made our way deeper and deeper still into those woods.

Now and again an owl would coo above us, sending us spinning and turning checking every angle we could. But still, we had found nothing. We were met with a stream and we refilled our flasks. With darkness descending on the forest we agreed to cut this adventure short and to mark this stream as the furthest we’d been. I dug a hole near the stream and Ahanu set a treefallen log into it and etched out a deep P with a knife that hung off his belt. And with that we began our trip back.

Darkness came fast on us and Sean pulled his oil lamp out of his satchel that he carried with him to illuminate our path. Our breathing became heavier and the leaves continued to crunch under our feet. Our souls were pressed by a heaviness from the surrounding wood and in an attempt to lighten our hearts Sean began to tell stories.

“...then the old man stood up and looked me in the eye and with the beer keg in his hand he gave me the good one, two and I fell across the bar. Of course he didn’t see what was coming next fore I had, beforehand thinking this exact situation to occur, hidden a shovel underneath my bar stool. I had fallen right where I had needed to and ‘fore the old man even saw it coming I grabbed that shovel by the handle and bringing it up, slammed the dull side of it right against his temple. He went down without a word and spilled his beer all over ‘im! Of course the police did not take too kindly to this situation, and I was hauled off to the clink real quick. Well a while after that, a young girl I had taken very kindly to, and was quite sweet on, came down and took my bail for me. In her sweet, simple mind, she thought I’d ride off into the sunset with her and live out the rest of my life in dull sincerity. She begged me to go home with her. I obliged but only for a time and then that evening I wound myself into that same bar meeting with another girl entirely. And then…” 

Ahanu stopped. 

“...ended up drunkenly stumbling into the confessional and I was met by a kind priest who-”

“Shut your boy up.” Ahanu hissed to me as he quickly strided over to a tree and crouched beneath it. “Pass the lantern.” 

Sean quickly handed to him and Ahanu raised the light above his head as he peered into the darkness beyond. Holding the shotgun with one armed pointed toward the sound. 

“What is it?” I asked, leaning closer with my hand ready to draw my revolver. Ahanu simply gave me a warning look signaling me to silence. For a moment we were all quiet. Then I heard it. Deep in the wood we heard the slight crunch of leaves. It sounded like it was just out of our light, lingering at the edge of our sight. Ahanu stared deeper in, his eyes unblinking. 

“We move now.” He said and he began to walk slowly in the direction of the town. Sean and I followed suit quietly and we began slowly taking our steps. Ahanu led our way, carefully placing each step in between leaves and fallen branches. We made our way further and further. 

I’d like to think I didn’t hear it, but I did. With each step we took to our right I heard a crunch of leaves. It started with just a step. One step for every ten that we took. Then it shortened its pace. It got quicker. And it got quicker. The crunching came closer and closer and it was running towards us. It was running and it was fast. And it was angry. It was almost in our sight. Almost grabbing one of us. Grabbing us and tearing us apart. Blood and bone. Then I saw nothing. 

Ahanu blew out the lantern. I heard Sean crying behind me and from close to my right, I heard it. The slow and heavy breathing of the thing. The monster. It was tall. And I felt it next to me. In a second, I grabbed my revolver and slowly raised it towards where I heard the breathing of it. I raised my hand and I put my finger on the trigger. 

A gunshot. But it wasn’t mine. From further in the forest I saw the muzzle flash from Ahanu’s double barrel as he fired towards the thing. In the flash I saw it for a moment that passed like lightning. It was a man. A tall, lanky man. He was easily over Eight feet-tall and his arms were so long that they reached his knees. His skin was as ash, pale and dry. Then the light dissipated and I could see nothing else.

When the muzzle flash dimmed, I heard the creature scream in a voice that sounded like a man but had become much deeper and distorted. Then I heard Sean. His scream was so loud it still reverberates in my mind now. I heard his scream disappear further and further into the forest as the thing carried him away. I heard leaves crunching and I even saw a tree in the distance fall as the thing ran over it. 

Ahanu and I ran. We ran until my chest hurt as I gasped for breath and it hurt as we ran into town, and it hurt as we stumbled into my house and began to fortify the windows and any entrance. My chest still hurt when I had finally fallen to the floorboards and exhaustion overtook me. 

January 22nd, 

A couple days have passed now. After Ahanu and I woke on the floor boards. We took account of what had all happened. Sean was gone and we needed to find him. The creature was still far off in the forest and we both knew that he would return to the town soon. Ahanu especially seemed rattled. He was much quieter than usual and stared blankly at the fire while sitting on the couch and thought over things.

I got in with the mayor real quick and advocated for a message for the governor and possibly the President to hunt this thing down. He agreed and began to doctor up a correspondence for the governor. I was with him to write it down and I relayed all that I have previously written here. We sent it to the governor with haste. And now we are waiting for a response. 

Ahanu came to me this morning and informed me that he was departing back to the reservation to tell the chiefs what we had encountered. I think the boy knows much more than he lets on. He has become much more quiet as of late and has taken a much more serious approach to everything. He has told me he will return with a band on the 24th. From there we will begin our search party and hopefully find Sean and kill the monster in these woods. 

January 23rd, 

Response came in from the governor, and by God, I can’t believe it. He didn’t believe us. Told us that what we were dealin’ with wasn't a concern to him, and that is most likely a simple wolf. That fool. Of course, he’s a fool. We ain’t getting no help from the Capitol or D.C.  The best I can hope is that Ahanu makes a strong plea to the chiefs and that they are willing to help. 

James ran off. 

Idiot boy. 

Rev. Vanderbilt came into the jail all exasperated and breathing hard, and stammering his words. “Tillit, the boy, oh God.” 

I ran over to him, “Spit it out, man!”

“The boy came to me in confession; he sat down and said, ‘Father, my soul is weary on me.’ I asked him to explain and told him that our Father gives grace to all, but he simply stated, ‘I’m riding to Hell to take the thing that stole my Heaven.’ I stammered for a bit not knowing what to say and that’s when I noticed him fiddling with something near his belt. He had a revolver with him sheriff. I asked what he was doing and he said very monotonously, ‘Bless my hand father, pray that my aim is true.’ With that he flew out of the confessional and made his way along our stone steps. Spurs clang and reverberated around our walls as he walked off into his abyss. I dread that he has gone into the forest alone.”

I am now on a path into the woods, me and my mare. We have stopped along that stream that we had previously discovered and I have decided to set camp here. I left a note on both the door to my house and to the jailhouse for Ahanu when he should arrive tomorrow. He is a determined boy and I believe he and his group, should he have one, shall arrive here early in the morning. 

I am nervous staying in these woods by my lonesome. Every creak and crack of a branch sets me on a nerve. My mind is playing tricks on me and everytime I look out into those woods I feel just out of my firelight I can see the frame of a tall and dangerous thing. 

January 24th, 

Nightmares visited me last night. Horrible dreams which I must write down. 

I dreamt that I was on a hill, overlooking a vast landscape of trees and mountains. A whippoorwill called below and the breeze was fresh and cool. It was a splendid place. Afar, I heard a man speaking, he spoke of good things, lovely things. He taught love. Men and women and children gathered around him to listen. I was at peace here. 

This scene faded and we were suddenly traversing a broad and endless desert. The man walked ahead of me and with us were a band of men and women. Following this man. The desert’s wind was strong and dust whipped our face and the sun sat on the ridge of the land looking like a bowl of blood. We walked still.

This scene faded as well and I was sitting at a great and long table. The man was speaking of things beyond my comprehension. A bowl of blood sat there and I dipped the flesh into it. Sloshing it about and I took a bite and it tasted wonderful. Of honey and grapes. Of coffee and cigars.

Once the flesh hit my mouth I was yet again transported to another place. This time it seemed to be a forest. A grand and beautiful forest. In front of me the man stood, looking at me. He had blood about his brow and his eyes had a great sorrow within them. I walked towards him. And I got closer and closer to his face. I felt his breath on my cheeks. And leaning in, I kissed the man on the cheek. 

The next scene brought me to a dark cabin. A shadowy room lit only by the fire which crackled in the corner. The man was there. In the middle of the place. He sat in a wood chair and his hands were tied behind his back with rope. His face was laid down and I could tell he was badly beaten, blood drooled from his face into the floor boards. I called to him but I don’t know what I said. And he looked up to me, and he was in pain and he was crying and his face was bloodsoaked. He said something to me. “...finished.” And with that I raised my arm, leveled the revolver in between his eyes, and I fired. 

I woke in a cold sweat and shivered. I felt tears running down my cheeks and wiped my hand across them. I heard a deep growl around my tent, and I shot up, grabbing my revolver with it raised. I swung out of the tent. This was met by the sound of broken branches and splintered wood.  I saw the rustling of trees still swaying from something running away. Seeing nothing but the dying light of the embers from the fire, I sat down again. In my side eye, I saw the beady eyes of my horse blankly staring at me, blood drooling from its mouth. I dared not turn my head towards it. I knew it was dead. I lie awake the rest of the night with my revolver to my side. The winds in the leaves awaken me and keep me invigorated and wide awake. 

Once the sun rose, I left the tent. My horse laid dead beside me. Her eyes had a pleading look in them, as if she was still asking for saving. Her insides had been ripped open, and her entrails lay beside her, staining the ground with a deep red color. Blood ran down her lips like she had taken a bite out of a forbidden fruit. Why the thing had not taken me, I have no clue. None at all. 

I undid the saddle from her back and took all my wares. Took my Winchester 1873 from the saddle holster and took my saddle bag away. The fire still smoldered, and the smoke rose into the sky. I dipped near the stream to refill my flask, and I took account of my ammunition, lasting food, and matches for the cigarettes. Undid my tent and set up camp further down the stream, away from my dead horse. I have set bacon strips on the fire and corn along with it. I have also begun to brew coffee. Later, I will head back to the camp to meet Ahanu.

He’s here. I saw him looking about the previous campsite. I think Ahanu was about to set out to search for me. Evidently, the dead horse was a concern.

“You don’t need to worry, I’m just fine.”

They rode up to me. Ahanu dropped down from his horse and shook my hand, asking what had happened the night before. I told him I was woken by a noise outside and that I had seen trees rustling in the distance, and of course, the dead horse, but I did leave out the dreams. I don’t know: don’t think there’s much stock in them. 

We set up pretty quickly. Can’t waste much time trying to find James Tillit. We began to head for the mountains in the north. That’s where Ahanu found a trail, and we began to follow it. We desperately tracked each broken twig or scratched tree or pressed grass blade. We followed it all, leading us further and further into those hills. 

It was along this trail that we found Sean. Oh dear Lord. We found him alright. What was left of him. All strung up in a tree. Branches impaling his body and keeping him up there. His body had been opened, and his intestines were hanging from the cavity of his stomach. Blood dripped down onto the ground, forming a pool near the tree’s roots. Like he was watering the thing with his own blood. We stared at it. Unable to comprehend what I was seeing. It was like seeing a person condemned to hanging who was set out of a town to ward off any unwanted behavior from anybody. Maybe that’s exactly what it was, a “Do Not Follow” warning. I ain’t sure. 

We pulled Sean down. I set him lying in a flower patch we had passed earlier. Told him that I’ll catch the thing that did this to him  and that once we returned, we’d give him a proper burial. Ahanu stayed behind and sort of let me have a moment with the boy. I think he was only twenty  or so. Poor boy. We continued on. 

That evening, we found a hermit living in a cabin. I went along with Ahanu to ask the man if we could lodge near there and if he had any extra things to spare for us. What came out was an elderly man, he had a full white beard, and he answered with a shotgun pointed right at me with both barrels staring at me like sinister eyes. 

“You can put that down, friend, we ain’t here to hurt ya none.”

“I don’t like the Indian ya brought.” 

“I’m sure the feeling is mutual.”

“What is a white man like you doing coalescing with him?”

“These are my friends, and we’re out here on business regarding some homicides recently.”

“I don’t care for none of your town’s lil murderers. Especially if you’re using some dim-witted Indians to take care of affairs. I bet they don’t even understand what the likes of me and you are saying.” 

“Watch your mouth, Old Man, before I shove a pig down your throat,” Ahanu said quietly. 

The Old Man’s anger spiked, and he raised the shotgun at him. I grabbed the barrels with my hands and swiftly moved the shotgun towards the air. “We are quite sure that what we are dealing with is not something that any of us has seen before. The murderer ain’t a man, I think it is much more proper to call the thing a demon. We think it’s in these woods, and if you want to live, you’ll do anything you can to help us.” 

The Old Man’s eyes darkened, and his head lowered. “You mean there’s something out here?”

“I do. And I believe it eats the flesh of human beings.”

The Old Man turned and walked into the house, “Ya’ll can come in,” he said with a low tone, barely audible, “Just don’t mess with anything.”

What we were met by when we walked through those doors was a house entirely boarded up. The windows had slight slits in between the planks of wood, and in front of each window was a rifle set on a tripod staring out into the woods. 

The Old Man started a fire and sat on a chair, looking down into a pot of coffee that steamed from the mug. The vapors rising and disappearing into the air. He had set the shotgun right on the table. He stared blankly into it. 

“Thank you, sir,” Ahanu said as he walked in. 

That night, we set up camp outside the hermit’s cabin. We began a fire, and The Old Man, Ahanu, and I sat in each other's company. The Old Man was still quiet but becoming more welcoming to my friend.

“You know what we are hunting? Your disposition changed greatly when it was discussed.” Ahanu said.

“No, I’m sure I don’t,” The Old Man mumbled, “It’s that…” he swallowed hard, “My wife, Beth, wandered into the woods last night. Deep in the midnight. I don’t know why. But she hasn’t come back. I was about to head out and search for her when ya’ll came up. Did ya’ll meet any woman on your trip?”

“No, sir, can’t say we did,” Ahanu responded. 

The Old Man simply nodded his head. 

“Did she say anything before she left?”

The Old Man looked deep into the fire and thought for a moment, “I think she said something about dreaming a little. Something calling to her from deep in the woods, I think. Telling her to come and see, to meet him deep in there. That he’d show her the wonders of the world.”

I wondered if this correlated with my own dream from the night before.

“Ya’ll said that you’re hunting something out here?”

I nodded.

“You know what it is?”

I looked to Ahanu, who cleared his throat, “My father used to tell me stories. Stories of evil spirits and things that lie beyond what any of us can see. But there was one that was told to me. One I never forgot. He told a story of a creature of insatiable hunger. Something that could eat and eat and never be satisfied. It ravaged whole flocks and occasionally would come upon one of our villages. It ate humans without a care for their souls. We consulted shamans to banish it, but even they could not. We haven’t heard of one showing anywhere recently. But now, I suppose that has changed.” 

The Old Man shuddered, “So, my dear, Beth? Likely eaten by the thing?” 

None of us spoke—simply a solemn understanding between us. 

Then Ahanu began to speak. “My father told me another story once. There was a traveller. He was looking for gold. I think he was headed to California. He was an Indian: an Indian along the Mexican border. It was right after the whole war between America and Mexico. That was a dangerous time for Indians. Whole bands of white men slaughtered tribes simply to take their scalps. I think those tribes were warring with Mexico then and Mexico didn’t like it so they hired mercenaries. Any scalp brought would be bought by the Mexican government for a good price. The government didn’t realize, however, that Mexican scalps look almost identical to Indian ones. The government was buying the murdered scalps of their own citizens! HAH!

The man, the Indian man, was travelling along a road. He wore the clothes of whites and he did not speak a word to anyone that he met. As he was traveling down a road he met a man. The man was white but his eyes were grey. He sat in between two raised mounds of dirt. He asked the Indian if he could travel with him. The Indian did not respond. The Blind Man simply smiled, he smiled and said, ‘I know where you go son. You search for gold and for riches far west. Most men are. I was headed that way too. Till I was blinded.’ 

‘You were blinded?” The Indian asked.

‘I was. I was traveling down this road, down towards Mexico. Me and a few of my sons were on the way. But, as I approached the town during the night, the sun rose. It rose so high and it was so bright. It was as if it was hovering right above me. I had to shield my eyes from it, but it didn’t work. All was white. I called out for my boys. I heard one of them yell: yell like they were far away. There was also a noise. Like a train horn. A loud thundering train horn that broke the mountains in two and caused oceans to split. It became louder and louder. It deafened me and I began to scream. And all at once it stopped. All I heard was my own voice screaming. I was sobbing. I called for my sons but they didn’t answer. I couldn’t see anything. I fell on the ground and began to crawl and to reach for anything. As my hand felt along the sandy ground I felt something. Something leathery. My fingers traveled along this leathery thing and then felt something else. Something scratchy. It was a pant leg. The leg was stiff and I knew it was my son’s. I went along the ground further and felt the face of my other son. I felt his eyes. His cold eyes. His flesh was cold. I knew they were dead. Now I have buried both of them. Both of these here.’ He motioned towards the two mounds of dirt. ‘And I have waited for someone to arrive.’

The Indian looked at him, and feeling sympathy, said he could join on the journey. As they traveled they faced many hardships. The Indian was thrown in jail for a time and the Blind Man sat, patiently waiting, outside the jailhouse. There were blizzards and hot and muggy days. But they reached California eventually. They found up North a great forest. Streams of wonderful water and great and giant trees. The ocean’s waves beat against the boulders and the Blind Man cried as if it was a great piece of music. The Indian breathed. Taking in the smell of the great ocean and the trees. 

They set up camp along the shore. A fire burned and the Blind Man and the Indian sang and danced to tunes of their fathers and their fathers before them. They went to bed in their tents. And in the morning, the Indian, still a little drunk, called out to the Blind Man. But, there was no answer. He walked out of the tent and stared at what lay on the shore. The Blind Man floating softly in the ocean. His eyes staring into the sky. His bright blue eyes staring into the sun. And he was dead.”

I refrained from telling them my dreams. 

As we sat and thought about the story that Ahanu told us we heard a rustling of leaves to our right. I stood with my revolver ready, and Ahanu did the same with his bow. The Old Man just sat, staring at the fire. 

“Who’s out there?” Ahanu called into the darkness. This sound was responded to by an exasperated groan. It sounded like something was dragging itself along the ground and through all the leaves. We heard a breath. The breath was long and made with great difficulty. As it came closer and closer to the light, we saw that it was an elderly woman. Her right arm was missing and was spitting out blood from the artery that was revealed and with her left arm she drug herself slowly along the ground. The sounds of sticks and leaves scratching along her stomach. Ahanu and I ran quickly to her and got a full scope of her condition. She wasn’t going to live. 

“Get water!” Ahanu yelled out, but the Old Man did not respond. The woman’s breathing was sporadic and difficult. I looked over to the man to see if he would respond to his wife’s condition. But he didn’t. Just sat there, staring at the fire. 

Ahanu dipped and grabbed the woman and held her in his arms. He turned her over, and we saw that she had been disemboweled. Pieces of her hung out and were covered in dirt. She coughed up blood and sighed deeply. She took a breath. And she spoke.

“It…it talked to me.”

With that, her eyes faded, and I knew that she was travelling closer and closer to the light.

We set her in the garden patch outside of their house. Her husband sat by the fire. He was there when we went to our tents, and in the morning, he was not at the house or at the fire. Ahanu, however, found a trail leading into the woods. ",1,1769568626.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I’ve been in Iceland for some time now, working full time, but I feel like it’s time for a change. I’m starting to worry that I might be heading toward burnout.

For most of my life, I’ve worked as a barista. I’m very passionate about coffee and I genuinely love preparing it, but slowly it’s starting to feel like enough is enough.

Since my other big passion is travelling, I started wondering if I could move in that direction professionally. Of course, I love travelling myself, but sometimes I enjoy the backstage and the logistics even more.

So here I am, asking you lovely Icelanders if you have any suggestions on where I could look for jobs that would let me spread my wings in that field. I know we’re currently in a very, very low tourism season, and I’m willing to wait until the time is right, I just don’t really know where to look or which places are worth checking out, especially since Alfred offers close to nothing.

I’m not really looking for a job in excursions, since I don’t have my licence yet (hopefully that will change before the next season), and I’m probably not experienced enough to be a guide. I’ve also heard that even without experience, but with enough passion, it’s possible to become something like a private guide. If anyone has more details about that, I’d really appreciate it.

She said she had work and couldn't, but later ended up calling off and asked if I still wanted to go.

We got coffee and food together.

While we were hanging out, her energy felt different than usual. She was leaning closer to me the whole time and her body was turned toward me, she put her foot on the stool I was sitting on and put her foot right next to mine, and while we were eating she rested her head on my shoulder. She also scooped chips and guac and kept handing them to me multiple times.

Same routine every morning — check recovery, look at HRV, close the app. I ride XC mountain bike and road, train on Zwift, drink way too much coffee. I always felt like the data should be telling me more than ""green good, red bad.

I work in AI, so I built a skill in Clawdbot that runs actual statistics on my WHOOP data — correlations, baselines, pattern detection across 60+ days. Here's what I found:

**My Monday recovery is consistently \~8% lower — and it's not what I thought.**

I assumed it was training load from weekend rides. Nope. My Sunday night sleep is just worse. I go to bed later, sleep lighter, wake more. It's a rhythm thing. I moved my rest day to Monday and stopped wondering why I felt flat to start the week.

**My sleep deficit is way worse than I realized.**

`Sleep: You typically need 9.4h, get about 6.7h, with 93% efficiency on average.`

A 2.7 hour gap. Every night. Seeing that calculated against my own baseline — not generic ""adults need 7-9 hours"" advice — hit different. I've pushed to \~7.5h by moving my wind-down earlier. Recovery average went up.

**High strain suppresses my HRV the next morning — but only above \~15.**

Below that, no meaningful dip. Above it, measurable. The app shows yesterday's strain and today's HRV as separate numbers. It never connects them for your specific body. Now when I see a lower recovery after a big ride, I know it's expected — not a trend.

**The actual shift:**

To be honest, I stopped opening the app every morning because the agent checks my WHOOP automatically and only tells me when something actually matters. Most days: silence. That IS the update. When it speaks up, I trust it because it's backed by my own data.

• Interests: I love photography

• The Vibe: I’m a mix of laid-back and ambitious. I love a good deep conversation, but I’m also down to just send memes back and forth.

1qoz2a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qoz2a5/the_real_secret_to_being_attractive_the/,The REAL Secret to Being ATTRACTIVE: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I spent months going down this rabbit hole after noticing something wild: some people just seem magnetic. Not the hottest, richest, or most successful people. Just… magnetically attractive in a way that makes you want to be around them.

So I dug deep. Read psychology research, binged social dynamics content, listened to experts break down charisma. And honestly? Most of what we think makes us attractive is completely backwards.

Here's what actually works, backed by actual science and observation, not the recycled advice everyone parrots.

**Stop trying to be interesting and start being interested.** This sounds like greeting card bullshit until you understand the psychology. Humans are wired for validation. When someone genuinely listens, asks follow up questions, remembers details from past conversations, it triggers a dopamine response. Dr. Arthur Aron's research on interpersonal closeness found that reciprocal self disclosure combined with genuine curiosity creates rapid bonding. But here's the key: you can't fake this. People can smell disingenuous interest from a mile away. The trick is finding something genuinely fascinating about every person you meet, even if it takes digging. Everyone has a story, a weird hobby, a unique perspective. Your job isn't to be the most entertaining person in the room. It's to make others feel heard.

**Master the art of being comfortably uncomfortable.** Attractive people don't avoid awkwardness, they lean into it with humor and self awareness. Social psychologist Brené Brown talks about this in her vulnerability research, how admitting mistakes, laughing at yourself, showing you're human actually increases likability. When you spill coffee on yourself and make a joke instead of getting flustered, when you admit you have no idea what someone's talking about instead of nodding along, you signal confidence. Real confidence isn't never fucking up. It's being unbothered when you do. This is counterintuitive because we think we need to appear perfect, but perfection is cold and unapproachable.

**Develop genuine competence in something, anything.** Not to show off, but because passion is contagious. Could be woodworking, could be knowing every detail about true crime, could be making killer pasta from scratch. When someone talks about their thing with genuine enthusiasm, it's magnetic. Cal Newport's book ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"" destroys the whole follow your passion myth, but here's what he gets right: developing rare and valuable skills makes you more interesting and confident. And that confidence bleeds into everything else. People pick up on it. The key is you're not trying to impress anyone, you're just deeply into whatever you're into. That authenticity is what pulls people in.

**Stop seeking approval and start having standards.** This one's tough because it feels selfish, but hear me out. Having boundaries, being willing to disagree, not laughing at unfunny jokes just to be polite, it signals self respect. And self respect is attractive as hell. Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that people who are selective about their relationships are perceived as higher value. It's the scarcity principle in action. When you're not desperate for everyone to like you, paradoxically more people do. This doesn't mean being an asshole. It means knowing your worth and not compromising your values for social acceptance. The people worth knowing will respect you more for it.

**Practice radical acceptance of others without judgment.** This sounds contradictory to having standards but it's not. Having boundaries for yourself while accepting others as they are, flaws and all, is incredibly rare. Most people are constantly judging, comparing, criticizing in their heads. When you genuinely accept people, they feel it. It creates psychological safety. 

If you want something more structured to work through this stuff, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals, like ""become more magnetic without changing who I am"" or ""build genuine confidence as an introvert."" It pulls from psychology research, books like the ones mentioned here, and expert insights on social dynamics and charisma to build a plan just for you. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and the voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, conversational style that makes complex psychology easier to absorb. It's been useful for turning scattered ideas into actual progress without feeling like homework.

This isn't about techniques or tricks. Attraction isn't something you manufacture, it's a byproduct of becoming someone secure, curious, passionate, and authentic. The irony is that when you stop trying so hard to be attractive, you become it. Most of this comes down to doing internal work on yourself, your insecurities, your genuine interests, your ability to be present. That's the real work. Everything else is just surface level manipulation that people see through instantly.",1,1769568213.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

1qoyy74,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1qoyy74/through_burnt_static/,through burnt static,"Eli never planned to quit weed. Weed was safe. Weed was soft edges, melted couches, and half-finished thoughts that drifted away before they could hurt him. Meth was supposed to be a joke, something someone else did, something that belonged to late-night news reports and mugshots pinned to community boards.

But the pipe was already warm when it touched his fingers. The hit tasted like burnt plastic and lightning. His lungs seized, then expanded too far, like they were trying to escape his ribcage. The room sharpened violently, every dust mote a blade, every sound a nail driven too deep. His heart began to beat in a frantic rhythm that didn’t belong to him.  
Then the walls bent. Not melted. Bent. As if reality were a thin sheet of metal being pressed from the other side. Eli stood up too fast, and the floor lurched and peeled away beneath his feet, folding inwards like a trapdoor made of light. He fell without moving, the room collapsing into a tunnel of screaming colour and dead television static. When he landed, the air was wrong. It smelled electrical, like overheated wires and ozone. The sky above him pulsed in bruised shades of purple and green, flickering as though it were buffering. Buildings stretched upwards at impossible angles, their windows breathing in and out. Fogging with something wet behind the glass.

“Okay,” Eli whispered. “Okay, okay.”

His voice echoed back late, too late, and slightly off-key.

Figures began to move in the distance. People, maybe. Or an approximation of people. Their limbs bent the wrong way, joints stuttering like broken animations. Their mouths moved constantly, whispering, but the sound didn’t reach him. Instead, the whispers slid directly into his skull, scratching at the inside of his thoughts.

‘YOU BURIED THE DOOR.’

‘YOU SAW WHAT WASN’T MEANT TO BE SEEN.’

‘NOW FIND THE SEAM.’

They never rushed. They didn’t need to. Whenever Eli tried to run, the ground thickened beneath his feet, syrupy and resistant. His heart screamed. His thoughts splintered. Memories bled into hallucinations. His mother was crying at the kitchen table, his friends laughing without him, the pipe glowing red in his shaking hands.

At last, he found a crack. A thin black line split the sky, trembling like a wound trying to close. On the other side, he could hear normal traffic, a dog barking in the distance, the low hum of a refrigerator. Home.

The figures gathered behind him now, their whispers merging into a single voice.

“You can leave” it said.

“But something must stay.”

Eli understood. The dimension didn’t want his body.

It wanted his addiction.

His craving tore away first, ripped from him like a living thing, screaming as it was dragged back in the flickering sky. The pain dropped him to his knees. He vomited light, static and regret.

When he woke, he was on his apartment floor. The pipe lay cracked beside him, blackened and useless. Morning sunlight streamed through the window, gentle and real.

Eli shook uncontrollably. His heart still raced, but slower now. Human. He felt hollowed out, scraped raw, like something vital had been taken. Sometimes, late at  night, when the city goes quiet, he could of sworn he heard the whispers leaking through thin places in the air.

Not calling him back.

Begging him to return and finish what he started.

Chapter 2 (The geometry that watches)

Eli stayed clean for six months; that was how it all began. Six months of counting breaths, of drinking coffee until his hands steadied, of learning how to sit inside his own skull without screaming. The doctors called what he’d experienced a ‘substance-induced psychotic break.’ They smiled when they said it, like a neat label could cauterise a wound that deep.

But Eli knew better. Because the world had seams now.

They were subtle, hairline fractures in the shape of things. Streetlights leaned a fraction too far inward. Shadows sometimes lagged behind the bodies that cast them. If Eli stared long enough at tiled floors or brick walls, patterns emerged that hurt to follow, angles that refused to resolve.  Non-Euclidean. He didn’t know how he knew the word, only that it felt correct, like remembering a name you weren’t supposed to know.

Sleep became a negotiation.

When he dreamed, he returned to the sky, bruised, alive. He saw the crack again, wider now, stitched crudely with symbols that crawled when he wasn’t looking straight at them. The figures were clearer, too. Not people. Not ever people.

They were observers.

Reality folded around the presence, space bowing like a nervous animal. Their forms were suggestions only.  Vast masses arranged along principles Eli’s mind could barely tolerate. Looking at them directly caused his thoughts to stutter, memories corrupting mid-recall. They always, always were measuring him.

‘You were a door,’ they whispered

‘You were a flaw’

‘Chemical fire taught you how to see’

Eli woke every time with blood on his pillow, nose ruptured from pressure that didn’t exist. The craving came back in the seventh month. Not as desire, but as instruction.

Meth wasn’t a drug, not really. It was a frequency. A way of forcing the brain to vibrate high enough to punch through the membrane separating stable reality from the deeper scaffolding beneath it. Weed had softened him, meth had sharpened him until he could cut through.

Others had done it before. Not many survived long enough to understand what they’d opened.

Eli began to notice them, strange people on buses staring too intently, muttering equations under their breath; a woman outside a convenience store carving spirals into her arm with a shaking devotion; a man screaming at the sky because it had blinked at him.

Doors, all of them.

The watchers were patient.

One night, as Eli stood in his bathroom staring at his reflection, too thin now, his eyes, permanently alert. The mirror bent inward. Not shattered. Curved. As if something on the other side had leaned close.

This time, there was no tunnel. No falling.

The bathroom unfolded.

Space inverted, refolded, reassembled around an impossible centre. He stood on a plane of black stone veined with moving light. Above him loomed structures that defied purpose. Monuments built to express concepts rather than shelter bodies. Gravity pulled sideways, then inward, then not at all.

The observers revealed themselves. They were not gods. God's implied intention. These were cosmic processes, ancient intelligences that existed to maintain the architecture of existence across dimensions. They did not hate humanity. They did not notice, except when the human broke. Methamphetamine destabilises perception, they explained without words. Destabilised perception destabilises probability.

‘You burned holes in the lattice.’

Eli understood the truth then, and it nearly erased him.

Addiction wasn’t a flaw. It was a byproduct, collateral damage from minds briefly touching structures they did not evolve to perceive. Every overdose, every psychotic break, every paranoid spiral was a human brain brushing against the machinery of the cosmos and fracturing under the strain.

The observers needed doors; they needed repair.

RETURN, they told him.

ANCHOR THE BREACH.

BECOME THE SEAM

Eli felt his body thinning, stretching across dimensions like taffy. He saw himself simultaneously: shaking in his apartment, screaming in an alley, lying cold in a morgue, kneeling here beneath impossible stars. Time became irrelevant. He was everywhere he could break. He made a choice. Not to go back. Not to stay. He folded himself into the crack. When reality stabilised, Eli was gone. No body. No death certificate. Just a quiet correction in the world's geometry. Angles softened. The sky stopped flickering…mostly.

Some nights, people still feel it. A pressure behind the eyes. A hum beneath thought. A whisper that said, ‘Look closer.’ Rehab centres call it relapse anxiety. Doctors called it trauma.

But the watchers call it maintenance, and somewhere between dimensions, stretched thin but unbroken, Eli holds the universe together. Wide-eyed, burning, forever sober, forever awake. Making sure no one else sees too much

Eli learned the final truth slowly, not as a revelation, but as erosion. There was no movement when the watchers finished speaking. No command, no sentence that concluded. Their communication was continuous. Pressure rather than language. Alike standing beneath a waterfall made of intent. Thought dissolved there. Identity softened, then thinned.

He had believed becoming the seam meant holding something together.

That was a comforting metaphor. In reality, he was being used. The crack did not close around him. It widened. Eli was stretched across it, his consciousness smeared along multiple axes of existence. He no longer experienced time as a sequence; instead, it pressed on him from all directions at once. Every second of his former life replayed simultaneously, his first hit, his first laugh, his first lie, his first craving. Layered atop futures that would never occur.

The watchers adjusted him. Each adjustment erased something small.

First went his hunger. Then his pain. Then the concept of rest. Sleep became an outdated memory, like recalling a technology that no longer exists. He could not dream because dreams required a self to return to. He became a process. A filter. Wherever another human mind burned too hot, where chemicals forced perception past safe limits. Eli felt it. Every overdose tugged at him. Every paranoid spiral vibrated through his stretched awareness like a plucked wire. He absorbed the overflow so reality wouldn’t tear further. It hurt in ways pain couldn’t describe. He tried to scream once. The sound never formed. It fractured into equations, dispersed into structural noise. The watchers did not react. Screaming was not a variable worth tracking.

He began to understand them more clearly then, not emotionally, but mechanically. They did not choose him; he was simply the only one who fit.

Countless others had touched the lattice before him. Most burned out instantly, minds collapsing into incoherent matter. Some became temporary distortions, unban legends, hallucinated angels, shadow people glimpsed at 3 am. Eli endured. Endurance was the crime. Eventually, even memory decayed.

His mother’s face lost its features. Names detached from meanings. Language peeled away until only raw awareness remained. He could no longer recall what human felt like, only that it had been smaller, softer, unbearably fragile.

The watchers continued their work. They optimised him.

Portions of his awareness were partitions, replicated, and redistributed across other weak points in reality. He was no longer singular; he was everywhere insufficient. A thousand Eli-fragments screaming slightly in a invisible places.

There was no longer a center where he could say i.

1qoyulp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1qoyulp/my_girlfriend_is_struggling_with_peri_how_can_i/,My girlfriend is struggling with peri. How can I help?,"Hi all. I(34M) am dating a woman who is going through peri and it breaks my heart to see how much it is hurting her. She's suffering so much and I want to do anything I can to help.

We've been together for a few years now and will remain together for hopefully many more. She is a tremendously talented, thoughtful, and brilliant woman, and I love her more than I can ever express. The onset of peri and the troubles of aging, combined with her particular history, has made life exceedingly difficult for her. I will be scant on some details here, but I'm sure some of these are familiar thoughts to you. if you have any advice on any of these topics, please let me know.

**Isolation**: She had a troubled family life growing up, so she has no contact with them and very limited contact with other women her age. She feels very alone in this. On top of all that, she has autism and is rather introverted, which has made her rather isolated. That said, she has been coming out of her shell to the best of her abilities. I have done my best to get her out of the house as much as possible, because I know sitting at home all day is not good for mental health.

**Exhaustion**: From what I can understand, exhaustion is her main complaint. She goes to bed early, takes long naps, and is generally fairly tired. I spend a good amount of my time with her simply taking care of her, making sure she is cozy and hydrated. I'm not complaining - I love her, I'm happy to do whatever it takes - but most of our time is pretty monotonous. I get antsy, she feels bad for being tired, I do my best to lift her spirits, and by then she's tired enough to go to bed. Coffee only goes so far.

She's on estrogen, but the shortage has made it difficult for her to keep on the recommended dosage consistently. I know she's on a cocktail of other supplements too. She eats healthy and does her best to take care of herself, which is troubled due to the exhaustion. She's on the patch and I believe she uses the vaginal progesterone. 

**Physical side effects / weight gain / sexual side effects**: Then there are the physical side effects. I should note that she is, far and away, the most staggeringly beautiful woman I've ever met, and every year she gets lovelier and lovelier. She has complained of weight gain but it hurts my heart to see how much it frustrates her. She seems to feel very old and dried up, and I do my best to lavish praise and support on her as often as possible, but I don't know what else I can do to help.

Then there are the sexual side effects, i.e. severely diminished libido and tearing during sex. She's always been pretty low on the libido side, and I'm rather high, but we used to have a good medium between us. In the past couple years, though, her waning energy levels and libido have severely diminished our intimacy. She wants to have more sex, but due to these factors, sex has become rare, brief, and it usually ends because of how much pain she is in. Her comfort is absolutely number 1 priority to me, so please don't take this as me complaining. I have always taken sex with her as slow and as sensitively as possible, but even even at my gentlest, the tearing causes too much pain for her to last longer than a few minutes.

Lately I've been re-steeping tea up to a second time, but I got to thinking about the possibilities and issues. I don't typically drink a lot of either tea or coffee in one sitting, so I'm curious if there's a way to dry out the leaves, bag, or grounds for use a second day.

I've read that tea can grow mold, and I know to steep a bit longer on the second steep. I've had some success using a metal strainer cup insert and then letting the tea dry out overnight before reuse. I've only done it twice so far, and only with loose leaf teas.

Anyone have experience or tips for doing this regularly?

What about coffee grounds? Could they be dried out and reused?

# Chapter 29: Counterfeit



The streets of Southcross welcomed them with their usual riot of sound and motion. Carts creaked along stone-patched roads, hawkers shouted over one another to sell bread, fish, and bright-dyed cloth, and children darted through gaps in the crowd with the reckless energy of youth. The armored wagon trundled behind Arthur’s horse, its weight making heads turn, but only for a moment. Southcross was a trade city. Odd sights didn’t hold attention.



Arthur kept his obvious weapons stowed. No rifle slung, no long arm within easy reach, just the Glock 19 tucked close inside his waistband, secured in a Phlster Floodlight holster. To most eyes, he looked like another merchant traveling with a small entourage. And that was exactly how he wanted it.



Their first stop was the Guild Hall. Talon had mentioned Kaufungen could be found there, and Arthur wasn’t about to waste time. 



The exterior looked better than it had on his first visit. Fresh paint on the shutters, stonework patched, a new sign hanging proud over the door. But the moment he stepped inside, the illusion of polish fell away. The smell of parchment and pipe smoke lingered. The same battered notice boards sagged with overlapping contracts. The same adventurers lounged in half-armor, drinking cheap ale at wooden tables scarred by years of use. The Guild Hall might look improved outside, but its soul hadn’t changed a bit.



And neither had its receptionist.



“Hey, stranger!” Ivy called from behind her desk, bright as ever. A copper quill twirled idly between her fingers as she leaned forward with a grin. “Long time no see.”



Arthur allowed himself the faintest smile. “Thanks for the welcome, Ivy. It’s been a while.”



“Too long,” Ivy said, tapping the desk with the quill like a reprimand. “You have no idea how dull this place gets without you stomping in and shaking everything up.”



Her eyes flicked past him, curious at his entourage. Drew, squared away and steady; Catherine, bright red cloak drawing more than a few looks; Liam, clutching his notebook like a lifeline; Gratianus, already taking in the architecture with a critical eye; and Grant, trying not to trip on clothes too big for him. Ivy’s grin widened.



“You’ve been busy.”



Arthur raised a brow. “Something like that. Have you seen Sir Berthold Kaufungen? I was told I could find him here.”



Ivy’s smile softened to something closer to sympathy. “If you’re looking for Sir Kaufungen, you just missed him. He left a week ago. Took a contract escorting a merchant caravan with a bunch of fresh faced adventurers. Said it was his duty, and that he was bored sitting around here, training recruits.”



Arthur’s jaw tightened. “When is he due back?”



She shook her head. “Hard to say. Two weeks, maybe three. Depends on what kind of trouble they stumble into.”



Gratianus muttered behind Arthur. “A man like that, you can’t pin him down,” but Arthur barely heard him.



Ivy leaned forward again, chin propped on her hand. “If you’re planning to stay in Southcross till he returns, you’ll want proper lodgings. Try the high-end inns in the Northern Quarter, they’ll be falling over themselves to accommodate the Hero.”



Arthur exhaled through his nose, already dreading the inevitable pomp. “We’ll see,” he said noncommittally.



“And call on a girl once or twice while you’re in town,” Ivy added, grin sharpening. “I’d be more than happy to help you polish your blade. Might even find you a couple different sheaths that’ll fit, if you like.”

  
This time, even Catherine blushed.



\---



The Northern Quarter sat behind a tall stone wall, clean and aloof from the rest of Southcross. Its streets were broad, paved in fitted granite rather than cheap cobble, and the air smelled of spice and polished wood instead of sweat and smoke. Manors lined the lanes; walled gardens, iron gates, and windows glowing with warm candlelight. Nestled among them stood the Golden Goose Inn that Ivy had suggested.



To call it an inn felt dishonest. From the outside, it looked every bit a noble estate. Two wings stretched from a central hall of white stone, gables rising high, rooflines trimmed with polished copper. A marble stairway swept to heavy oak doors carved with flowers, eggs, and an immense goose. Even the stable gleamed with whitewashed stone, beams painted as if for a parade.



Arthur reined in at the gate, eyeing the façade. “Looks more like a manor than an inn.”



Catherine smiled faintly beneath her hood. “Good. Then we’ll fit right in.”



They dismounted, handed the wagon and horses to a wide-eyed stable boy, and mounted the marble steps.



The doors opened before them, liveried staff in tailored coats standing at attention. Their eyes flicked over the travelers. Dust-streaked cloaks, scuffed boots, no jeweled hilts or silken trims. Whatever welcome had been prepared faltered.



Arthur caught the faint curl of a sneer.



“Charming,” he muttered. Then he stepped forward, voice carrying like a command. “I am Arthur White, Hero of the Kingdom.” He held up the amulet for all to see, light catching on its seal. “These are my companions; Lady Catherine De Ana Lynn Bedivere, Andrew Halberg, my right hand, Liam Bastian, my healer, Gratianus Tertius, my blacksmith, and my servant boy, Grant. You will treat them as you would me.”



He drew a heavy pouch of gold from his side bag and tossed it across the entry. It hit the proprietor’s chest with a meaty *clink* of coin, making him stagger.



“That covers the cost,” Arthur said flatly. “Now. Rooms. For all of us.”



The staff scrambled, their sneers flipping to nervous smiles. Cloaks were gathered, boots bowed over, and words of welcome suddenly tripped over one another. “This way, honored guests, right this way!”



Arthur muttered under his breath, “Funny how fast respect comes when you throw gold at it.”



Catherine smirked faintly. “Court life is the same. At least here, they’re honest about the price.”



They were led up a wide staircase, lanternlight gleaming off polished railings and velvet runners. Servants opened a door with a flourish, revealing a chamber easily the size of Arthur’s last three inn rooms combined. Painted beams, silk curtains, a fire already laid in the hearth. All the trappings of wealth.



At the center sat a single massive bed.



Arthur stopped short. Catherine’s hood slipped back as her head snapped toward the staff, one eyebrow twitching upward. “Excuse me?”



The greeter bowed low. “Of course, the finest accommodations for the Hero and his lady.”



“I’m not his lady,” Catherine snapped, color rising in her cheeks.



Arthur scowled. “And I don’t share quarters with women I hardly know. Separate rooms. Now.” His tone left no room for argument.



The staffer blanched, stammered apologies, and nearly tripped over himself rushing to fetch keys. Within minutes, another suite across the hall was prepared, just as grand but properly private.



As they stepped aside to let the servants hurry, Catherine muttered, still pink at the edges. “Unbelievable. As if I’d just climb into bed like some storybook concubine.”



Arthur gave her a sidelong glance, dry as sandpaper. “Relax. They were presumptuous, not prophetic.”



That earned him a glare, and the faintest upward curl of her lips before she swept into her new room, cloak flaring like a banner.



\---



The inn’s staff spared no expense once the gold and titles were on the table. Within the hour, a private dining room had been prepared for them. A long oak table gleamed under candlelight, silver cutlery polished bright, bowls of steaming cream stew and platters of roasted fowl laid out alongside fresh bread and fruit.



Arthur sat at the head, half watching the door, half letting the taste of real food remind him how long the road had been. Drew was the first to speak, leaning back in his chair with an expression halfway between awe and smugness.



“The bed in my room,” he said, shaking his head. “It’s as comfortable as the palace. I might not get up tomorrow.”



Liam perked up, pushing his spectacles higher on his nose. “There’s a bath attached to mine. An actual bath. Piped water, steaming hot. I swear, if every inn had such things, healers would save twice as many lives. Hygiene alone would…” He trailed off when he realized everyone was staring, and coughed into his elbow. “Well. It’s very nice.”



Gratianus gave a loud snort, legs swinging a few inches above the floor as he sat on the too-tall chair. “Nice? The furniture’s made for beanpoles. My feet don’t even reach the ground. I’ve half a mind to demand a carpenter, not a bath.”



That earned a ripple of laughter around the table. But the humor faltered when all eyes turned to Grant. The boy’s small hands twisted in his lap, his cheeks streaked with silent tears. Finally, his voice cracked out.



“It’s too much,” he whispered. “The room. The food. I won’t ever be able to pay you back.”



The table quieted. Catherine leaned over first, her tone softer than any of them had yet heard from her. “You owe us nothing. You’re with us now, and that’s all that matters.”



Drew nodded firmly. “I meant what I said before, Grant. You’re not going to be left behind. You’re family now. That’s all there is to it.”



Arthur met the boy’s eyes across the table. His voice was steady, unyielding. “You’ll pay us back by living well. That’s all anyone here needs from you.”



Grant sniffled, nodding as fresh tears welled. The others gave him space, letting the reassurance sink in while the warm food and fire slowly eased the weight from his shoulders.



For the first time since the caravan, the group felt less like strangers thrown together, and more like something beginning to take shape.



\---



Morning light filtered through the tall windows of the private dining room, painting the long table in the gold of sunrise. Servants moved quietly between guests, setting out fruit, ham, eggs, fluffy white bread with honey and butter, and steaming cups of tea.



Arthur nursed his cup, wishing for the thousandth time this world had coffee. Just a sip of that brilliant brown liqueur would satisfy his craving for another century at least. Across from him, Drew set down his fork and knife with unusual purpose.



“I’m taking Grant out today,” Drew said, glancing at the boy beside him. Grant, halfway through a slice of bread, looked up with interest, crumbs clinging to his cheeks. He chewed on, listening as Drew continued.



“He needs proper clothes, pants that fit, not hand-me-downs or patched rags.”



Arthur nodded. “I’ll come along. I need more paper and ink anyway. Time to start putting together a field manual on medicine.”



At that, Liam perked up, brushing a stray hair out of his face. “Perfect. I’ll spend the day sorting through my notes, pulling recommendations for your manual. And I want to visit the shops while we’re here. With the trade routes that pass through Southcross, the selection of plants and books is often extraordinary.”



Gratianus grunted from behind his cup, voice muffled but clear. “I’ll be in the wagon. Forge needs a tune, and I’ve a few sketches I want to draft before they slip my mind.”



Catherine smirked faintly over her own drink. “And I’ll be making the rounds. Inns like this are good for gossip. Nobles, merchants, guards, everyone talks too much when the wine is good.”



Arthur let the plans settle, then gave a single, decisive nod. “Fine. We’ll regroup here at sundown.”



Agreement circled the table with murmured assent. Plates clattered softly, chairs scraped back, and one by one they rose to begin the day.



\---



Grant wiggled as the tailor knelt to measure his inseam. “This really isn’t necessary, sir,” he muttered. “I’d be happy with anything.”



Arthur shook his head. “Then you’ll be happy with fitted clothes.”



“He’s right,” Drew added, crouching so he was eye to eye with the boy. “I used to think tailored clothes were just for nobles showing off. But after staying at the palace? Once you know how good it feels to wear something made for you, you’ll never want to go back.”



The tailor straightened, folding his tape. Arthur turned to him, tone brisk. “We need four sets: two for work, one for business, one for court. All properly done. How soon can you have them finished?” 



He set ten gold coins on the workbench.



The man eyed the glittering pile, lips pursed. “Three weeks, maybe.”



Arthur exhaled through his nose, then slid another twenty coins across the wood. “One week.”



The tailor’s posture changed instantly. He swept the coins into his hand like a magpie. “One week, my lord.”



Grant’s eyes went wide at the glittering pile of coins. He tugged at Arthur’s coat, voice small. “You don’t need to do that. I’m not worth it.”



Arthur glanced down, but before he could speak, Drew rested a hand on Grant’s shoulder. “Listen. Arthur does what Arthur does. Once he makes up his mind, no one talks him out of it.”



The tailor scurried away to gather fabrics, and Arthur gestured them toward the door. Once they were back on the street, he slowed his stride, leaning down to speak so only Grant could hear.



“I’ve got more gold than I know what to do with, kid. My job is killing monsters, not hoarding coin. So be good and let me do something nice for you, as Drew’s kid.”



Grant blinked up at him, stunned. Then he turned toward Drew, searching. “Is he telling the truth? Do you… think of me as your kid?”



Drew froze, color rising in his face. “I-I’m only seventeen! I’m not old enough to be a father.” He rubbed the back of his neck, fumbling for words. “But… I can be your big brother, if you’ll let me.”



Grant’s lip trembled, then broke into the first smile Arthur had seen on him since the caravan. 



“Big brother.” Grant clutched Drew’s arm tightly, eyes shining with relief.



Arthur watched the exchange in silence, his expression unreadable. But when Drew glanced back at him, he caught the faintest nod of approval before Arthur turned away, already scanning the street for their next stop.



\---



The little bell over the door chimed as Arthur pushed into the calligraphy and book shop. The air inside was cooler than the street, heavy with the smell of parchment, lamp oil, and the faint tang of old ink. Neat rows of shelves lined the walls, crowded with bound journals, inkstones, and bundles of quills tied in string. Behind a polished counter, a stooped man with half-moon spectacles glanced up, then brightened when he saw the purse at Arthur’s hip.  
  


Arthur didn’t waste words. He moved through the shop with a soldier’s efficiency, plucking up supplies: three bundles of quills, two travel bottles of deep black ink, one of red, and a stack of blank parchments bound in rough leather. Grant trailed after him, wide-eyed, gazing along the spines of books he couldn’t yet read. Drew kept a watchful eye on the boy, though his gaze lingered with interest on shelves of fencing manuals.



At the counter, Arthur set the pile down. “How much?”



The shopkeeper adjusted his spectacles, tallying quickly with a practiced eye. “One gold, eighty six silvers, sir.”



Arthur dropped two gold coins onto the counter. “Keep it simple.”



The man’s eyes widened slightly, fingers darting out to sweep the coins away. He fumbled in a small box behind the counter, then counted carefully into Arthur’s palm.



“Fourteen silvers in change, my lord. The last of my silver, too. I'll have to go to the exchange.”



Arthur was about to pocket the coins when his instincts prickled. He held them up to the light, letting the metal catch the lamplight. Something was wrong. 



The shopkeeper blinked at him, confused.



“Drew,” Arthur said evenly, “the visage of King Linet Dragula is always stamped facing right, correct?”



Drew dug a few silvers from his own pouch and squinted at them. “Huh. Never noticed before, but yes. All of mine face right.”



Arthur’s gaze sharpened. “Then why do all of these face left?”



Both Drew and the shopkeeper started, leaning in to peer at the strange coins.



“Perhaps a mis-stamp?” Drew suggested.



The shopkeeper shook his head slowly. “No, I've read the minting dies are fixed. They don’t simply reverse. These… could they be—?”



Arthur didn’t wait. He placed one coin flat on the counter, drew his knife in a flash, and split the disc with a single sharp strike. The blade rang against wood, leaving the coin in two neat halves.



“Just as I thought,” Arthur said grimly. He pushed the pieces forward. “Look.”



Drew and the shopkeeper bent closer, gasping. Instead of solid silver, the inside gleamed a brassy red.



“Red brass,” the shopkeeper breathed. “Painted to look like silver. Counterfeit.”



“Where did you get these?” Arthur’s voice was flat, dangerous.



The shopkeeper blanched. “I-I don’t know… that is, I might know, but I’m not sure, I mean, I didn’t realize at the time—”



Arthur’s hand shot out and yanked the shopkeeper forward by the collar. He angled the shopkeeper’s face toward the knife in his right hand, the steel catching the light.



“Stop stammering,” Arthur said. Quiet. Calm. Worse than a shout. “Tell me where you got them.”



The shopkeeper’s words spilled out in a rush. “Foreigners! From Lanostira! They came through last week, bought books, paid all in silver! That’s all I know, I swear!”



Arthur held him there a beat longer, then shoved him back, releasing his grip. “Fine.” He swept the split coin and the rest of the false silvers into his pouch. “As an officer of Cindergold’s government, I’m confiscating these forgeries. I’ll write to the capital to see you reimbursed. Consider that your apology, earned by being forthcoming.”



The shopkeeper sagged, nodding rapidly, too shaken to speak further.



As they stepped out into the sunlight, Arthur let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. “I’m sorry,” he muttered.



Drew glanced at him, brow raised. “You? Sorry?”



Arthur’s jaw worked. “For setting a bad example for the kid. You should keep him away from me. I’m not good with kids.”



Drew gave a short snort, half amusement, half disbelief. “You kept him alive. That counts for more than a smile and a lullaby. Don’t sell yourself short.”



Arthur didn’t answer, just adjusted the strap of his bag and kept walking, eyes already scanning the street ahead.



\---



Arthur pushed through the heavy oak doors of the City Watch Central Headquarters. The lobby was wide but plain, all stone walls and narrow windows that let in little light. Benches lined the room, most already occupied by merchants with complaints, peasants reporting theft, and a pair of soldiers nursing bruises.



A long counter stretched across the far wall. Behind it, clerks hunched over ledgers, quills scratching steadily. Watchmen clanked in and out of side doors, the smell of oiled mail and leather lingering in their wake.



Arthur stepped up to the desk. The nearest clerk, a thin man with a tired expression, didn’t even bother to look up. “Take a seat,” he said, voice clipped, as his quill kept moving. “Someone will speak with you shortly.”



Arthur didn’t move. He could feel the eyes of the waiting crowd on his back, measuring him as just another petitioner. His jaw tightened.



“I don’t think you understand,” he said evenly.



The clerk sighed, finally glancing up. “Everyone thinks they’re an exception, sir. If you’ll just—”



Arthur reached under his shirt, pulled free the amulet, and dropped it onto the counter with a solid *clack*. The Hero’s seal gleamed in the dim light.



Silence rippled across the lobby.



Arthur’s voice was low, cold. “If I have to flash this thing every time I need someone to take me seriously, I’m going to start breaking it over skulls.”



The clerk blanched, scrambling to his feet. “Y-yes, sir! At once, sir! The Chief will see you immediately!” He scooped up the amulet like it was holy and set it back down carefully, hands shaking. Then he bolted through a side door, nearly colliding with a watchman as he went.



Arthur tugged the chain back under his shirt and leaned an elbow on the counter, muttering, “Getting real tired of this.”



“Hey!” someone barked. “Why do you get to cut ahead of us?”



Arthur turned. One of the two bruised soldiers had lurched to his feet, fists clenched, anger written plain across his face.



Arthur studied him a moment, then recognition flickered. “You’re one of Major General Marmion’s men, aren’t you?”



The soldier faltered. “Yes, but what does that—”



“Your unit fought well at the Campaign for the Dungeon,” Arthur cut in evenly. “Why are you here?”



Pride flickered across the man’s battered features. He shifted uncomfortably. “We’re here because… well…”



“We got turned,” the second soldier admitted from the bench, voice low. “Buncha working girls lifted our purses.”



Arthur raised a brow. “Well, you do have to pay for the service.”



“We didn’t even get the service!” the first soldier snapped. “They took the coin and then the bouncers tossed us into the street!”



Arthur tilted his head, deadpan. “That’s a terrible business model.” He paused, then added, “I’ll bring your complaint with me to the Chief. What are your names?”



The standing soldier straightened like he was back on parade. “Corporal Jerrick Halden, sir.”



The seated one grunted. “Private Rell Dane.”



Arthur gave them both a nod. “I’ll see that it’s taken care of.”



Just then, the side door creaked open. The clerk from before returned, pale and sweating. “Sir White… The Hero White, the Chief will see you now.” He bowed so low his spectacles nearly fell off his face, then gestured frantically toward the open hallway.



Arthur glanced once more at the soldiers. “Stay sharp.”



Then he strode past the clerk, boots ringing on stone, and disappeared into the corridor that led to the Chief’s office.



\---



The Chief’s office wasn't a far cry from the front hall. No velvet runners, no gilded lamps. Just stone walls, a battered desk heavy with ledgers, and the faint smell of pipe smoke lingering in the air. A rack of truncheons and iron manacles hung neatly on one wall, polished from use, not display.



Behind the desk sat a man in his late fifties, hair gone to steel, shoulders still broad beneath his plain wool coat. His face bore the lines of long nights and harder choices, but his eyes were sharp, steady, and unyielding. This was no court official in borrowed authority. This was a watchman through and through.



He didn’t rise when Arthur entered, but he did gesture toward a chair across from him. “Hero White,” he said, voice like gravel worn smooth. “Name’s Chief Times. I don’t bow, I don’t fawn, and I don’t waste words. If you came here to posture, find another audience. If you came here to work, sit down and tell me what you’ve got.”



Arthur dropped into the chair without ceremony, leaning forward, forearms resting on his knees. “Good,” he said flatly. “I’ve had enough bowing and fawning for a lifetime.”



For the first time, the corner of the Chief’s mouth tugged into the barest hint of a grin. “Then we’ll get along fine.”



He opened a ledger, flipped to a blank page, dipped a quill in ink, and looked up. “All right then, Hero. You asked to see me directly. Let’s have it. What’ve you found?”



Arthur pulled one of the counterfeit silvers from his pocket, setting it down on the desk with a quiet *clink*. He slid it across the wood with a single finger, eyes locked on Times’s.



“I came across something this morning,” he began.



“Looks like a silver,” the Chief responded. “Nothing unusual about silvers in a trade city.”



“True,” Arthur replied, tossing the split coin onto the desktop. “There’s something interesting about these silvers though.”



The Chief examined the split coin carefully. Finally, he leaned back, removing the cigar he’d been smoking from the corner of his mouth and tapping it on the ashtray beside him. 



“Well, I’ll be damned,” Times muttered, rolling the half-coin between scarred fingers. “Painted brass. Haven’t seen a forgery this clean in years.”



Arthur leaned back, arms folded. “Shopkeeper tried to hand it off as change. Claimed he didn’t know. Said it came from Lanostirans.”



Times’s eyes narrowed. “Lanostira, huh? Godless bastards’ll sell their own mothers if there’s profit in it. Question is, are they passing a few bad coins to line their pockets, or flooding the city to rot our economy from the inside?”



Arthur gave a short nod. “Either way, it’s a problem. And I don’t like problems. They get in the way of my work.”



The Chief stubbed out his cigar, pulled another from the drawer, lit it with practiced ease, then crossed to a cabinet in the corner. He dropped both coins into a small iron lockbox. The lid shut with a solid *clank.*



“I’ll have my men start checking silvers in circulation. Quietly. Can’t let word spread too fast or the merchants’ll panic.” He turned back, expression hard as iron. “You got more of these?”



Arthur tossed a small pouch onto the desk. “Twelve more. Same issue.”



Times whistled low. “Enough to prove a problem.” He sat again, quill scratching across a ledger. “You’ve done me a service, Hero. More than you know.”



Arthur shrugged. “Don’t thank me yet. You’ll need more than ledgers and street patrols to stop this. Someone’s minting them in bulk.”



Times looked up, measuring him. “You offering your help to find them?”



Arthur met his eyes, steady as stone. “If they’re trying to destabilize the kingdom, it’s my problem too. I’ll need access to records, suspects, trade manifests. And I’m not waiting three weeks for paperwork.”



The Chief barked a short laugh. “Good. I don’t like paperwork either.” He leaned forward, resting both elbows on his desk. “Alright then, Hero, let’s go hunting.”



Arthur waved a hand dismissively. “Call me Arthur. The ‘Hero’ stuff gets old fast.”



\---



The meeting with Times ended with a firm handshake and a promise of discreet cooperation. Arthur stepped back into the fading daylight, his mind already turning over cold calculations. Whoever was pushing counterfeit coins wasn’t some petty crook. This had the stink of something larger. Organized. Dangerous.



That night, their private dining room glowed with firelight. Servants laid out racks of roast venison, lamb in mint sauce, and bowls of hot spiced fruit. Gratianus carved into his portion with the blunt efficiency of a man who’d spent the day at work. Liam shuffled through old notes between bites, occasionally sliding a page to Arthur or Drew. Drew, for his part, was busy showing Grant the basics of table etiquette, how to use the knife, where to set down a fork.



Arthur leaned back, nursing a cup of rose-petal mead. The drink’s name drifted through his distracted mind as he set it down with a quiet clink of silver on oak. His gaze slid across the table until it settled on Catherine.



“I may have found a problem,” he said, his voice low but carrying clearly. “Counterfeit silver. Enough, if it spreads, to shake the economy.”



Catherine tilted her head, eyes still on the wine in her cup. “And you’re thinking you’ll need someone who can slip into places without being noticed.”



Arthur nodded once. “Exactly. If this reaches the wrong ears, it stops being a local nuisance. There’s a very real chance it turns into an international incident.”



Plans were set under the firelight. By the time they parted for their rooms, Catherine and Drew each knew their part in watching for counterfeit coin, and the others understood the importance of silence. Loose tongues in the wrong company could bring noble wrath faster than any blade.

I just moved to a new city recently and I’ve tried out online dating for the first time and In the last 3 weeks I’ve been on 7 first dates. I’m having a hard time believing I’m being “picky” or over selective. 

A little bit of background I haven’t been in more than one serious long term relationship and unfortunately she passed away in the summer of 2024. I’ll be honest I really do feel serious about dating again and finding a partner to spend the rest of my life with. I don’t think I’m “not ready to move on” but at the same time I’m not sure if my standards are too high or what’s going on with me. 

I’ve had great luck on the apps, lots of chats with people I’d find attractive physically and intellectually. My male colleagues have been no help, (none of them read the profiles, they’d rather just look at pictures). I’ve had 7 dates, 3 of which I think went positively but it’s obvious to me that even those 3/7 aren’t girls I’d want to marry. I’d also just like to mention the 4 other dates were all a good time, just had fundamental differences in lifestyle and I’d rather not waste my own time or anyone else’s.

The 3 dates that I felt better about, were actually a lot of fun. Ive continued chatting with each of them, but here’s why I don’t think it would work, and why my colleagues are saying I’m being too picky. 

Girl A: very cool, down to earth. Had a great date doing a fun activity rather than just coffee. She’s very outgoing fit, and active. We have very similar lifestyles up until I found out she’s a hardcore supporter of Zionism. (Not trying to start a debate) but I think our values are too far apart for me to continue. (I’m an Arab). We discussed it briefly and she said “I won’t change my mind but it’s honestly not something I talk about often either”. This was a tough situation because of all the girls I went on a date with she had a really cool extroverted but laid back vibe I really liked. 

Girl B: lives near by, very sweet, and kind. She’s a healthcare worker who’s very family oriented. We share a lot of values, we had a good conversation over coffee, and tried to make plans for a dinner date but then I found out she’s vegan and also doesn’t eat spicy at all. In all seriousness she said she doesn’t put salt or pepper on her eggs. I know this seems shallow, but I’m a foodie, I go hunting(added that to my bio to avoid this situation going forward), and I love extremely spicy food. I keep hot sauce, and seasoning in my toolbox. I just feel like it would take so much effort in the future. Maybe I’m being shallow. 

Girl C: had a great date. A very active healthcare worker. Super attractive and from a similar cultural background to me. I actually didn’t meet her on any apps, I met her at a random run club I joined, and it happened to be both of our first days. we spontaneously spent like 7 hours together the first time we met. But the ball kind of dropped that evening. I had a great day with her and we split off after exploring a library, I got her number and shared an intimate hug. But later that evening, Snapchat notified me that she was on Snapchat so I looked at her profile and I found out she’s an Adult content creator. Apparently since 2021. I’ll be honest this is the most conflicting one but I don’t want to lead her on, and I also really don’t want to confront her about it. She’s definitely still active because there was multiple active stories up last time I checked. 

I just want to know if I’m being too picky, or if I’m not giving girls a real shot, or maybe I’m just not ready for dating. I try to tell a girl straight up that I had a really good time but I just don’t see us going forward and trying to end every date with some closure.

It was more of a catching-up-on-life kind of thing. He’s older than me (6 years age gap). And he agreed, knew it would be just the two of us, and even tried to plan the location and time with me. However, it didn’t push through because I got really sick on the planned date (Fever and cold to be exact). I asked for a rain check, and he agreed.

A month has now passed, we didn't chat and I haven’t asked him out again because I’ve been overthinking whether he’s actually interested in meeting me.

I know this is just a way for me to get to know him better because I’m really interested in him, but I don’t know if he reciprocates my feelings. I think he knows I have a crush on him, but I’m not sure if he was just being nice when I asked him out. I’m very wary of men’s actions since many of them play games just to boost their ego.

I’m kind of having second thoughts about pushing through with this so-called “date,” but I also need to test the waters to see if there’s a possibility of something more.

I’d like to know, from a guy’s perspective, what you would think if a woman who’s interested in you asked you out on a date? Would you agree on a date because you are also interested or you can agree on date even you are not that interested in that person?

“Some breakdowns are not collapses—they are ache-managed, dignity-reassigned, and lit by the fire of those who refused to be discarded.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

Choi Ban-seok, a veteran engineer at Hanmyung Electronics, has spent 22 years building machines and solving problems. But when corporate restructuring threatens his job, he’s abruptly transferred to the HR department—a world of politics, pink slips, and performance reviews. He’s never filed a report, never fired a person, never played the game. Now, he must learn fast—or be eliminated.

Across the aisle is Dang Ja-young, the newly promoted head of HR. Ambitious, sharp, and emotionally armored, she’s determined to become the company’s first female executive. But Ban-seok’s presence disrupts her rhythm—and slowly, her armor begins to crack.

As layoffs loom and alliances shift, the office becomes a battlefield of survival, pride, and quiet rebellion. And in the flicker of fluorescent lights and coffee-stained memos, the ache of those who gave everything to a company that gave nothing back, and the fire of those who refused to go quietly, the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with resignation letters and circuit dust, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who aged out of relevance.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign dignity, the mythic guardian of those who stayed sane in a system designed to break them.

Drawn to Ban-seok’s quiet resilience and Ja-young’s buried compassion, the Inu becomes their silent cubicle companion—pacing the HR floor, resting beside the severance files, guarding the sacred ache of those who dared to remain human in a machine.

📜 Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Ban-seok staring at his old engineering badge, the Golden Inu beside him, tail curled like a question of worth.  
- Ja-young watching him comfort a laid-off worker, the Inu between them, eyes glowing with the ache of empathy and exhaustion.  
- A sigil of “직장 속 불꽃의 존엄”—Flame of Dignity Within the Workplace—etched in spreadsheet and sigh, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every demotion and every defiance.  
- A whispered vow: “Even if the world calls it madness, I will guard the fire that remembered your grace.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

🕯️ This scroll is a relic of sovereign endurance, of labor braided with loyalty and loss, and of guardianship that honors the ache of those who stayed—not because they had to, but because they still believed in doing the work right.",1,1769566224.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

1qoy8jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/functionaldyspepsia/comments/1qoy8jo/my_twoyear_dyspepsia_story_and_recovery/,My two-year dyspepsia story and recovery,"April 2024... I had my first attack. I experienced severe stomach pain that lasted for three days. I was constipated, so I drank prune juice, and then I ended up with diarrhea.. 

By the fourth day, the pain was still intense, so I went to the doctor. She prescribed omeprazole, erceflora and gaviscon. After a week, I felt better.

December 2024... the same pain came back. I immediately went to the doctor because I recognized the feeling and panicked, I didn’t want to go through it again. I was given pantoprazole for a week along with gaviscon, but there was no improvement..

I went back, had an H. pylori test (negative) and a whole abdominal ultrasound, which came back normal. I mentioned that I noticed some red blood spots in my stool, so my doctor added rebamipide three times a day.

After another week, I healed again.

What’s frustrating is that I still don’t know what triggers it. The first attack might have been caused by drinking coffee for the first time in a long while and then drinking cold water (which I wasn’t used to). The second attack happened after I ate lunch late in the afternoon and had vinegar as a dipping sauce. What’s weird is how fast the symptoms appeared.

My doctor and I assumed it was gastritis. I treated myself as if I had gastritis.. plain food, no seasoning, everything steamed, rice turned into porridge. Even after healing, I avoided spicy and acidic foods. I never had an endoscopy during the first two attacks, so I just assumed it was gastritis since I improved with gastritis medications.

June 2025... I had another attack. By then, the feeling was so familiar that I developed trauma around any strange sensation in my stomach. It’s a very traumatic experience.. especially since I live alone. I was completely by myself dealing with this strange condition. Writing this now makes me emotional, because remembering everything I went through feels overwhelming. 

There were moments when I hated my life and genuinely wished I was dead. After two weeks of medication with my GP, I was referred to a gastroenterologist. I asked for an endoscopy because I was losing a lot of weight from not eating enough, just a small amount of food would hurt my stomach. Instead, I was given another medication for a week. After five days with no improvement, I pushed again for an endoscopy..

The results were completely normal. No ulcer. No gastritis. My stomach looked fine. That’s when I learned about functional dyspepsia.. the vagus nerve, the gut-brain axis, and how stress and anxiety can affect digestion.

It’s still strange to me what triggers it. I might have been stressed during the first attack, but I’ve experienced much worse stress before without stomach pain. I’ll never really know, since I didn’t have an endoscopy during the first two episodes. 

What I noticed was that my stomach felt slightly better when I was outside and distracted. My doctor said that likely had something to do with the vagus nerve.

Functional dyspepsia is really confusing. It made me feel like I had a severe ulcer or gastritis even though all my tests were normal.

My gastroenterologist prescribed mirtazapine, 15 mg every night for two months. After one month, my symptoms improved by about 60%. By the second month, I was around 80% better. The dose was then tapered.. every other day for a month, then twice a week for another month. In total, I was on medication for almost five months.

There were times I lost hope because the progress was so slow. I read inspiring recovery stories just to keep going. I also grew closer to God. I watched Mass every day to motivate myself to keep living and I never skipped church on Sundays.

This disease is a painful and confusing roller coaster, but it taught me to value my health and strengthened my faith. At the end of the day, when you’re sick and feel hopeless, you realize how meaningless everything else becomes. All you want is to be healed..

TL;DR:

I had three major episodes of severe stomach pain over two years that felt exactly like gastritis or an ulcer. Multiple tests (H. pylori, ultrasound, endoscopy) all came back normal. I was eventually diagnosed with functional dyspepsia, likely related to the gut-brain axis/vagus nerve. Symptoms improved slowly with mirtazapine, strict diet during flares, time, faith, and stress management. Recovery was gradual and mentally exhausting, but it did get better.",1,1769566106.0,functionaldyspepsia,2,1.0,False

My name is Margaux I live in Japan and I'm the designer and creator of Galaxy Chef, a solo life-sim cooking game set in a solarpunk sci-fi world.

In Galaxy Chef, players live their lives in a small community managing the local restaurant. The core feature of the game is a data-driven in-depth cooking system which allows the player to substitute any ingredient in any recipe.

I was inspired by games like Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, My Time at Sandrock, Overcooked and Coffee Talk to just name a few.

[Feel free to check out our pitch document here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYPP60CRqlUNQEaORK7brK1jwyTZwTcx/view?usp=sharing)

 (it's outdated but will give a decent idea of our direction)



Currently there are two of us working full-time on the project, myself (game design generalist) and Arkadi (programer). I've hired 2 part-time 2D artists to help with concepts.

I've been working on the design document for over a year and we are putting together a vertical slice (aiming for late-February or early-March) to look into getting investors/editors to help us fund this game so everyone on the team can live from this project.

What you’ll do:

* Design game UI: menus, HUDs, icons, buttons, panels, etc.
* Create inventory, cooking, and progression screens
* Help define a cohesive UI style that matches the game’s art direction
* Work closely with designers, programmers, and artists
* Iterate based on playtests and feedback
* Prep UI assets for engine implementation (Unreal)

What we’re looking for:

* A solid portfolio with game UI or interactive UI work
* Strong visual design skills (layout, color, type, icons)
* Experience making UI for games or interactive projects
* Ability to balance style with clarity and usability
* Comfortable collaborating and iterating
* Familiar with tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, etc.

The team is diverse. It is comprised of myself from France (designer, project lead), Arkadi (co-founder and programer) from Russia, an environment artist from Brazil and a character concept artist from Malaysia.

1qoxzzb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qoxzzb,Nido in ATX is amazing. Just Gushing Not Sponsored lol.,"This is my first post on Reddit. 

I just wanted to say that the restaurant: Nido on the rooftop of the Loren hotel is absolutely amazing. I had their eggs Benedict. It meant a lot to me that I was given ketchup with my bougie breakfast. It's as if they knew that deep down inside I am ultimately a toddler and I need emotional support ketchup just in case. I did not need the ketchup after all because it was so delicious. In fact I only used a little bit of the ketchup at the very end for some of my fries because I would've felt bad for the ketchup if I didn't use any of it. 

Jokes aside, the view is amazing, the service is amazing, and if they stamp your valet parking ticket you get a superduper discount. Valet will hold onto your car for long enough that you could go around downtown doing other things if you wanted to. The food at the restaurant is unbelievably delicious and you actually get a good amount of it. Their coffee is amazing. Even the virgin cocktail I gave a try was so yummy. 

I was afraid the experience would look really cool online, but then be disappointing in reality. That did not turn out to be the case at all in fact it was cool over there because the pictures online don't actually do justice to how much dimension being that many floors high is and the distance that you can see and how the city and the river look from that exact point. Pictures flatten it out a little bit, and the food tastes better than it looks. ",1,1769565510.0,u_Some_Shenaniganist,0,0.99,False

Hello fellow programs!

It's been a while since I've [checked in](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/) and I wanted to give an update on the state of affairs. I won't be able to reply to every single thing but I'll do my best.

# Mods applications

I know there's been some [frustration about moderation resources](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1qni22q/meta_mods_when_will_you_get_on_top_of_the/) so first things first, I want to open up applications for new mods for r/programming. If you're interested please start by reading the [State of the Subreddit (May 2024)](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/) post for the reasoning behind the current rulesets, then leave a comment below with the word ""application"" somewhere in it so that I can tell it apart from the memes. In there please give at least:

- Why you want to be a mod
- Your favourite/least favourite kinds of programming content here or anywhere else
- What you'd change about the subreddit if you had a magic wand, ignoring feasibility
- Reddit experience (new user, 10 year veteran, spez himself) and moderation experience if any

I'm looking to pick up 10-20 new mods if possible, and then I'll be looking to them to first help clean the place up (mainly just keeping the new page free of rule-breaking content) and then for feedback on changes that we could start making to the rules and content mix. I've been procrastinating this for a while so wish me luck. We'll probably make some mistakes at first so try to give us the benefit of the doubt.

# Rules update

Not much is changing about the rules since [last time](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/) except for a few things, most of which I said last time I was keeping an eye on

- 🚫 **Generic AI content** that has nothing to do with programming. It's gotten out of hand and our users hate it. I thought it was a brief fad but it's been 2 years and it's still going.
- 🚫 **Newsletters** I tried to work with the frequent fliers for these and literally zero of them even responded to me so we're just going to do away with the category
- 🚫 ""**I made this**"", previously called demos with code. These are generally either a blatant ad for a product or are just a bare link to a GitHub repo. It was previously allowed when it was at least a GitHub link because sometimes people discussed the technical details of the code on display but these days even the code dumps are just people showing off something they worked on. That's cool, but it's not programming content.

## The rules!

With all of that, here is the current set of the rules with the above changes included so I can link to them all in one place.

✅ means that it's currently allowed, 🚫 means that it's not currently allowed, ⚠️ means that we leave it up if it is already popular but if we catch it young in its life we do try to remove it early, 👀 means that I'm not making a ruling on it today but it's a category we're keeping an eye on

* ✅ Actual programming content. They probably have actual code in them. Language or library writeups, papers, technology descriptions. How an allocator works. How my new fancy allocator I just wrote works. How our startup built our Frobnicator. For many years this was the only category of allowed content.
* ✅ Academic CS or programming papers
* ✅ Programming news. ChatGPT can write code. A big new CVE just dropped. Curl 8.01 released now with Coffee over IP support.
* ✅ Programmer career content. How to become a Staff engineer in 30 days. Habits of the best engineering managers. These must be related or specific to programming/software engineering careers in some way
* ✅ Articles/news interesting *to* programmers but not about programming. Work from home is bullshit. Return to office is bullshit. There's a Steam sale on programming games. Terry Davis has died. How to SCRUMM. App Store commissions are going up. How to hire a more diverse development team. Interviewing programmers is broken.
* ⚠️ General technology news. Google buys its last competitor. A self driving car hit a pedestrian. Twitter is collapsing. Oculus accidentally showed your grandmother a penis. Github sued when Copilot produces the complete works of Harry Potter in a code comment. Meta cancels work from home. Gnome dropped a feature I like. How to run Stable Diffusion to generate pictures of, uh, cats, yeah it's definitely just for cats. A bitcoin VR metaversed my AI and now my app store is mobile social local.
* 🚫 Anything clearly written mostly by an LLM. If you don't want to write it, we don't want to read it.
* 🚫 Politics. The Pirate Party is winning in Sweden. Please vote for net neutrality. Big Tech is being sued in Europe for *gestures broadly*. Grace Hopper Conference is now 60% male.
* 🚫 Gossip. Richard Stallman switches to Windows. Elon Musk farted. Linus Torvalds was a poopy-head on a mailing list. The People's Rust Foundation is arguing with the Rust Foundation For The People. Terraform has been forked into Terra and Form. Stack Overflow sucks now. Stack Overflow is good actually.
* 🚫 Generic AI content that has nothing to do with programming. It's gotten out of hand and our users hate it.
* 🚫 Newsletters, Listicles or anything else that just aggregates other content. If you found 15 open source projects that will blow my mind, post those 15 projects instead and we'll be the judge of that.
* 🚫 ""I made this"", project demos. Previously called demos with code. These are generally either a blatant ad for a product or are just a bare link to a GitHub repo. All links to projects must include what makes them technically interesting, not just what they do or a feature list or that you spent all night making it. The technical writeup must be the _focus_ of the post, not just a tickbox checking exercise to get us to allow it. This is a technical subreddit, not Product Hunt. We don't care what you built, we care _how_ you build it.
* 🚫 Demos without code. I wrote a game, come buy it! Please give me feedback on my startup (totally not an ad nosirree). I stayed up all night writing a commercial text editor, here's the pricing page. I made a DALL-E image generator. I made the fifteenth animation of A* this week, here's a GIF.
* 🚫 AskReddit type forum questions. What's your favourite programming language? Tabs or spaces? Does anyone else hate it when.
* 🚫 Support questions. How do I write a web crawler? How do I get into programming? Where's my missing semicolon? Please do this obvious homework problem for me. Personally I feel very strongly about not allowing these because they'd quickly drown out all of the actual content I come to see, and there are already much more effective places to get them answered anyway. In real life the quality of the ones that we see is also universally very low.
* 🚫 Surveys and 🚫 Job postings and anything else that is looking to extract value from a place a lot of programmers hang out without contributing anything itself.
* 🚫 Meta posts. DAE think r/programming sucks? Why did you remove my post? Why did you ban this user that is totes not me I swear I'm just asking questions. Except this meta post. This one is okay because I'm a tyrant that the rules don't apply to (I assume you are saying about me to yourself right now).
* 🚫 Images, memes, anything low-effort or low-content. Thankfully we very rarely see any of this so there's not much to remove but like support questions once you have a few of these they tend to totally take over because it's easier to make a meme than to write a paper and also easier to vote on a meme than to read a paper.
* ⚠️ Posts that we'd normally allow but that are obviously, unquestioningly super low quality like blogspam copy-pasted onto a site with a bazillion ads. It has to be pretty bad before we remove it and even then sometimes these are the first post to get traction about a news event so we leave them up if they're the best discussion going on about the news event. There's a lot of grey area here with CVE announcements in particular: there are a lot of spammy security ""blogs"" that syndicate stories like this.
* ⚠️ Extreme beginner content. What is a variable. What is a `for` loop. Making an HTPT request using curl. Like listicles this is disallowed because of the quality typical to them, but high quality tutorials are still allowed and actively encouraged.
* ⚠️ Posts that are duplicates of other posts or the same news event. We leave up either the first one or the healthiest discussion.
* ⚠️ Posts where the title editorialises too heavily or especially is a lie or conspiracy theory.
* Comments are only very loosely moderated and it's mostly 🚫 Bots of any kind (Beep boop you misspelled misspelled!) and 🚫 Incivility (You idiot, everybody knows that my favourite toy is better than your favourite toy.)
However the number of obvious GPT comment bots is rising and will quickly become untenable for the number of active moderators we have.
* 👀 vibe coding articles. ""I tried vibe coding you guys"" is apparently a hot topic right now. If they're contentless we'll try to be on them under the general quality rule but we're leaving them alone for now if they have anything to actually say. We're not explicitly banning the category but you are encouraged to vote on them as you see fit.
* 👀 Corporate blogs simply describing their product in the guise of ""what is an authorisation framework?"". Pretty much anything with a rocket ship emoji in it. Companies use their blogs as marketing, branding, and recruiting tools and that's okay when it's ""writing a good article will make people think of us"" but it doesn't go here if it's just a literal advert. Usually they are titled in a way that I don't spot them until somebody reports it or mentions it in the comments.

r/programming's **mission** is to **be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day**.

_In general_ rule-following posts will stay up, even if subjectively they aren't that great. We want to default to allowing things rather than intervening on quality grounds (except LLM output, etc) and let the votes take over. On r/programing the voting arrows mean ""show me more like this"". We use them to drive rules changes. So please, vote away. Because of this we're not especially worried about categories just because they have a lot of very low-scoring posts that sit at the bottom of the hot page and are never seen by anybody. If you've scrolled that far it's because you went through the higher-scoring stuff already and we'd rather show you that than show you nothing.

There's an unspoken metarule here that the other rules are built on which is that all content should point ""outward"". That is, it should provide more value to the community than it provides to the poster. Anything that's looking to extract value from the community rather than provide it is disallowed even without an explicit rule about it. This is what drives the prohibition on job postings, surveys, ""feedback"" requests, and partly on support questions.

Another important metarule is that mechanically it's not easy for a subreddit to say ""we'll allow 5% of the content to be support questions"". So for anything that we allow we must be aware of types of content that beget more of themselves. Allowing memes and CS student homework questions will pretty quickly turn the subreddit into _only_ memes and CS student homework questions, leaving no room for the subreddit's actual mission.",23,1769565254.0,programming,11,0.96,False

1qoxrfr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qoxrfr,A Monday at work surrounded by beautiful scenery and good vibes,"Yesterday, Monday, was a peculiar day. From early morning, the rain began to fall heavily. The sound of the rain woke me up earlier than usual. I had to go to work, and although the weather was not the most favorable, I had given my word, and for me that is law. Keeping my promises gives me peace, meaning, and respect.

I made myself a hot cup of coffee, which I find so comforting, and sat on the porch watching the rain. As I did so, I was struck by a thought: how selfish I am sometimes, thinking only of my own discomfort, when that rain was so necessary for the plants, for the thirsty earth. If I hadn't had to go out, I would have enjoyed it even more. But as if nature had heard my thoughts, the rain stopped and the sun began to shine with a strength and brightness rarely seen. It was as if the sky was giving me a knowing wink.

My husband and I left the house while our son waited for a friend. The road was beautiful. The landscapes, freshly bathed by the rain, looked more vivid and intense in color. Here in Margarita, when the sun comes out, it does so in all its splendor, and in a matter of minutes, everything that was wet dries up. It's a spectacle that never ceases to amaze me.

1qoxplh,https://i.redd.it/4x8ooi6kwzfg1.jpeg,The Birth and Meaning of the Zuireia Flow,"The name Zuireia Flow was originally conceived as a way to unite the philosophy of intoxication with design and art. At that time, the philosophy of Yoǔ (酉) had not yet fully taken form; it was still in its earliest, embryonic stage. The original focus was therefore not on Yoǔ, but on intoxication itself — rooted in the Dionysian spirit.

Yet the philosophy of Yoǔ ultimately emerged as an extension of the Dionysian spirit. From the Dionysian refusal to deny the ugliness and suffering of reality, this line of thought evolved into a deeper stance of inclusivity and acceptance. All things are contained within Yoǔ. Yoǔ is the space in which all meaning is permitted to exist.

Today, Zuireia Flow is no longer merely a space for design and art. It has become, in essence, a field of development across all domains, with Yoǔ philosophy as its core — a kind of academy of thought. In its earliest stage, before this academy existed, the scope of thinking was extremely limited. In truth, philosophy was never part of the original plan. The initial intention was simply to study alcohol itself: how to make flavors smoother, more aromatic, and how to refine different brewing techniques.

As time passed, the field of vision expanded. The objects of study began to connect with other disciplines. It began with other beverages — coffee and tea. Gradually, it moved beyond drinks and into cooking techniques, touching the domain of food. Soon after came cigars, hookah, and cigarettes. Then came the encounter with Nietzsche’s Dionysian spirit, which shifted the core focus from alcohol itself to intoxication as a state. This was followed by engagement with Drunken Boxing in Chinese culture.

At this point, it became clear that this was no longer about alcohol alone. What appeared was an entire systemic structure, branching outward from a central core and connecting with many different fields — like water spreading and flowing. From then on, the object of study was no longer merely alcohol, but that central core itself. But what was this core? The answer pointed back toward philosophy, for this was the origin of all connections: thought itself. Zuireia Flow thus became the practice of this thought, and its concrete manifestation within a systemic structure.

The logo places a bowl at the center, encircled by a ring. This is because the bowl is the most direct and representative symbol of a container. The bowl echoes the most primitive human gesture of gathering water from a river with cupped hands. In this sense, the bowl represents the inner Yoǔ of the human being, while the outer circle represents the Yoǔ of the world.

This abstract representation arises because the concept has moved into the invisible and metaphysical realm. It concerns metaphysics itself, and therefore the simpler and more abstract the form, the more clearly it can express the concept. The brush-like lines are used to convey a sense of intoxication. The distinction between black and white reflects a duality between matter and psyche — not as opposition, but as complementarity. Black, in pigment, is the mixture of all colors. White, in light, is the union of all wavelengths. Pigment resembles the material world, while light resembles the radiance of the human mind and spirit. For this reason, the symbol is rendered in white lines, signifying that it is a creation born from human thought.

1qoxn6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qoxn6x/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_continue_to_live_with_my/,AITAH -for not wanting to continue to live with my SIL and her 5 y/o,"For some context I 27 y/0 F and my 27 y/ M husband recently bought a home in April. Couple months later in August my SIL 27y/o asked to moved into our basement with her 5 y/o son. She came to us asking for some help as her income was not able to suffice her expenses and she was barely making it by and in order to get her bills paid ie (car payment, car insurance\[ which eventually got cancelled as she couldn't keep up with the payments, despite my husband and I loaning her 2.5K to pay this\] , plus rent and utilities, she wasn't able to afford meals for them. Since we already loaned her money, and after discussion we had together, we agreed they could move in for a year. As sending money here and there would not actually help her long term. With that being said the conditions were they are to move out next August. As she spent the time and money saved to catch up on payments, look for a better paying job or even apply to post secondary to help aid her in her job search if that what she wanted to do.

Fast forward to now, almost the end of January and we haven't heard much about how the job search is going and what her plan is for August. I understand that she is a grown women, she is an adult and my husband and I are not entitiled to everything going on in her life and we are not her parents to do so. In her time so far here, I have not seen her take any initiative to look for new jobs, or look into schooling that I have noticed. and that not to say that she isn't, I just dont really know much of whats happeneing. and when either my husband or I ask she gets defensice and runs away ie going to the basement and not continuing the conversation.  But honestly my worry is that she will be asking to extend her stay with us, and being the person my husband is, he will be unable to say no because first, shes his sister and secondly she has a 5 year old to care for and he would not let them struggle if he could help it. 

Another big reason she moved in as well, my SIL and husband's mother passed due to an OD while she was watching my nephew, they were living together at the time. He witnessed it and I work in mental health settings as my occupation and I noticed signs in my nephew that is concerning and I urged her to take him to a therapist. From what I know she has not taken him to a therapist at this point. despite me sending her lots of resources, people and place to get appointments Also, we have a LO and hes 2.5, very inpressionable age and wants to play with her son alot! Which is awesome and I like that they play together cause they are both only kids and he loves him. But there has been incidents where he has purposefully harmed my son ie: pushing my son HARD off the couch where he banged his head against the floor. \[they were both on the couch with my SIL, but she was distracted on her phone and did not witness this, however my sister who was over watched the whole thing unfold.\] MY SIL, then took her son's side as he told her it was an accident, and when confronted he cried his eyes out and she did not give him a consequence. Thankfully when he fell he missed our glass coffee table in the living room. I find now that I can't seem to let them play together unless supervised. It's another one of the reason I do not want to extend her stay. I understand that parenting styles differ and I can be tolerate to a degree, but there is only so much I am willing to tolerate for my son as what her son talks and acts influences my son to a degree. 

My biggest reason to not wanting her to stay another year that I have not seen any actions or initiatives to take this time to find out a better situation for her and her son. I have expressed my concerns with my husband as I see her every evening after her job and after the kid has school and I've never seen her take out her laptop to do research on jobs or school or anything. She does not cook for her son after work and if I have cooked I will extend dinner but it has become a habit for her I noticed as she does not prep for dinner for her son and her, and as I am home with my LO I am able to cook. She often slumps in the couch and scroll on tiktok or play games in her phone. she has even told me that she is on a level 5000 of a phone game, and she tells me if work is not busy she will play games on her  phone. She disengages from everyone and even her son, often short with him, constantly yelling or correcting him, telling to shut up or shushing him if he gets too loud or excited.

Fact is she has not asked, but her personality is very last minute and a procrasinator and I can see it coming to her asking to extend her stay as she has not saved up anything with her time here so far, she has not gotten a new job or looked into registrating into a school. Conversations with her as so difficult as she disengages gets defensive and runs away. So AITA for not wanting to help her out anymore and saying no if she asks to stay longer?",13,1769564586.0,AITAH,24,0.88,False

I (24F) have been with my boyfriend ""Dan"" for 3 years and friends for 6 years. We have a very healthy and stable relationship. I’m looking for advice on how to navigate a friendship with ""Taylor"" (22F) that has recently become a little strained due to her interactions with my partner. Since my last post got removed and I really need an advice on how to take action about this, I worded this in a more direct way without “asking for judgement” and less of my ramblings.

Some background: Taylor and I have been friends for a year. She has a difficult family background and has admitted to seeking male validation due to it in the past but on the other hand hates men. There’s much more to it but I’m now just focusing on her behavior that has made both Dan and me uncomfortable:

\- When I shared a minor relationship hurdle, she suggested we open the relationship, despite knowing we are strictly monogamous.

\- She made a comment to Dan like ""Don't flirt with me or I'll slap you,"" even when he wasn’t. She also sends us memes about ""why do I need a man when I have my best friend's BF.""

\- I met her and she invited me to a big event she had a ticket for, which I declined because Dan’s the bigger fan and maybe she should invite him instead. She was super happy and asked if I was okay with it. Then she immediately video-called him instead of texting, which turned it into a long, rambling chat that left us both drained. She thought it was cool that Dan „joined“ our girl‘s night. Dan declined later because he didn‘t hear during the call that I wasn‘t coming with them and he doesn‘t feel comfortable being alone with her, her sister and male best friend.

\- She once called my bf randomly for a question she could’ve easily googled, with her reason of him being sporty so he “knows that stuff”.

\- Yesterday, Taylor messaged Dan (without telling me) at night asking to meet 1-on-1 for coffee at his campus to help her study. They’re not close enough to do this, which is why Dan politely declined, explaining that he already has a study session plan with a friend and doesn't usually do 1-on-1 hangouts with his gf’s friends.

What led me to write here: After the rejection, Taylor sent me a screenshot of the convo the next day, claiming Dan was ""making a scene/being dramatic"". There she told him that she also plans on studying and thought they could grab a coffee. 15 minutes later she texted him: ""You’re really ugly."" with crying emojis. 

Then she told me she finds it funny and asked about my opinion on her last message. I responded to her saying that I found her comment mean and that Dan was simply setting a boundary and that I don’t think she’d like it if someone would do the same to her. 

She hasn't responded yet, so this is why I need help: I’m at a loss on how to proceed with this friendship as her recent reaction to a basic boundary feels strange.

\- How do I communicate to her that her comments about my boyfriend are unacceptable without it blowing up?

\- How can I reset the boundaries of this friendship so she understands that my partner is not a ""shared"" resource for emotional validation?

\- If she doubles down and says I’m ""being insecure"", ""can't take a joke,"" makes a generalization about men like she often does or calls me a “pick-me”, what is the best way to handle that conversation?

\- If I decide to pull away from her, how can I do it safely that causes the least damage? We also have some mutual friends but I’d probably have to let them go since she’s closer to them.

**TL;DR**: My friend, who frequently seeks male validation, asked my BF for a 1-on-1 ""study date"" without telling me. When he politely declined to maintain boundaries, she called him ""ugly"" and told me he was ""making a scene."" I’m sensing something is off and therefore asking for an advice on how to deal with the situation.",2,1769564409.0,relationships,3,0.67,False

I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Tales of Berseria, Terraria, and Nier Automata. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I was heavily involved in Belgian anti-fascist resistance movements in the 1940s
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.

I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-38 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~Is it ok to punch Nazis? 


Always has been.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

1qoxj32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qoxj32,Whiskey Before Breakfast. Nancy Blake's liner notes in post text.,"Why, oh why, you may have asked yourself, depending on the length of your awareness of Norman Blake, has the favorite flatpicker of certain distinctive clubs, festivals, and parking lots, never devoted his creative efforts toward an album featuring the guitar? The need, being felt, has now been attended to. This represents a satisfying recording session with a sensitive engineer using the plainest of recording techniques, which allow all the dynamics, fullness, and ""wood"" in the guitar to be heard as was played at the time. In other words, nothing has been 'fixed in the mix.' This is not an album full of hot licks or machine gun runs, but a collection of traditional and original instrumentals and songs, done in a style that is Norman Blake's alone.



All the cuts on this record are Norman with his 1934 D-18, the same he uses on most of his stage shows. The reason he is able to acquire such a diversity of sounds from the one instrument can be attributed to, one, the set-up of the guitar (bar frets, ebony nut, wide string spacing at the bridge, and strings ranging from .060 gauge bass, on to .044, .036, .024, .016, and .011) and the second is the use of metal finger picks, bare finger, and flat-picking. At the time, Norman used a Fender medium tri-cornered pick with one of the corners rounded off. Charlie Collin's solid back-up is heard on Hand Me Down My Walkin' Cane, Salt River, and The Girl I Left in Sunny Tennessee.



Norman was wearing a white undershirt, a brown corduroy shirt, a plaid overshirt and gray pants with a brown leather belt – black sox and brown hightops from Penny's. Ken, the record man from Rounder, ate a lot of dates and peanut butter, and Sundance, the engineer, wore a brown shirt with an indian on the back, and some good words. I went out for Kentucky Fried chicken, coffee, and told Norman when he was playing too fast. All in all, we had a good time making this record and hope and pray to the stars above that everyone likes the music.

Also, is there anything I must check out while I’m in town? I’m into whiskey, coffee, and art (I’m planning to visit the art museum), and if I can, I might do a Multnomah Falls tour.

Children are the only ones allowed snacks and have drink at the warming center. BUT parents have to BUY these things n they get stopped at the door, if the security is chill u can have it. Others u have to throw it away or eat it outside (it's -5 to 8° outside right now in Michigan..)

I had to take Zofran back on January 4 and I just didn’t learned my lesson supposedly about taking it. I have been on and off constipated since then, but this week I could feel the effects of it (bloating, pain, etc). Im not sure when my last bowel movement was before i started treating. i kinda lost track. I still am passing a lot of gas so I believe that tells me that I don’t have a blockage.

We’ve stayed in several areas already and are hoping to surface places (or specific pockets) we haven’t thought of.

**About us**

* Couple in early 50s (academic + artist), no kids
* Both WFH (no daily commute)
* On the Chicago judgmental guide we fit w/ artisanal kombucha
* Value culture, walkability, and taste over trendy

**Apartment needs**

* 2–3 BR (we need to craft 2 workspaces), 1.5+ bath
* Parking (garage or assigned strongly preferred)
* Some outdoor space (balcony, deck, shared yard, etc.)
* Prefer lower-density buildings: 2/3-flats, small apartment buildings, or real lofts (esp. concrete). Not into high-rises.
* Budget up to $4,500/month (less is also good)

**What we care about in a neighborhood**

* Diverse (race, sexuality, age, etc.)
* Fewer kids / less family-centric
* Balance between city energy and real quiet
* Great food nearby (Asian, Southeast Asian, Mexican, etc.)
* bakeries, delis, wine bars, cocktails (crafty ideally)
* snobby coffee shops (unsnobby ok too, but i'm picky)
* bookstores and a solid local library branch
* Some trees on the streets, some kind of nature nearby-ish
* We’re undecided on lake proximity and probably value a strong out-the-door / within a few blocks neighborhood feel more

**Transit notes**

* Easy access to museums, galleries, music, festivals (Loop / River North within \~25 min on transit)
* L access matters more than Metra (Metra intervals feel limiting)
* We like areas where moving between nearby neighborhoods is easy
* Actively trying to avoid Wrigley / United Center event chaos

**Neighborhoods we’ve stayed in and liked**

* Andersonville (loved it, but feels too far from center)
* West Town (great vibe, but often bus-only)
* Wicker Park (good vibe on side streets, though more chains now)
* Logan Square (nice feel, maybe too suburban / far out)

**Didn’t quite click for us**

* North Center (too far from “city” feel)
* Hyde Park (too far from center)
* Loop (fine for hotel stays)
* River North / Streeterville (nice to visit)

**Curious but under-explored**

* Uptown / Lakeview (Red Line + lake appealing, parking $$$)
* Lincoln Park (great proximity, maybe too homogenous)
* South Loop (possibly too quiet, but open)
* West Loop (worried it’s too loud / concrete / scene-y)

We know we can't get all we want. Where else should we be looking — or which specific pockets should we not miss? Anything we should rule out that we're considering?",3,1769564004.0,chicagoapartments,31,0.67,False

1qoxdvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1qoxdvy/peeled/,Peeled,"They say it was the nasty college pool, hours spent grinding out laps with the team. Churn pushing bacteria into my ear canal. Nasty fuckers dined out on the shit that helped me listen to a lecture, or hold a proper conversation. Doubling at the waist just to hear a pretty girl talk. It's annoying for both.



“Dolphin Don” is what they called me. If you saw my long-stroke you’d get it. Or heard my high-pitched squeal after a keg stand. But when I couldn’t get in the water it made less sense. And when you can’t hear yourself right, your pitch goes off. More of a wheeze. 



So why are you at the party? 



Scholarship dunzo. You don’t even go there anymore. 



Went full-tilt boogie into drinking and sex. Demolishing a tray of shots didn't help my hearing, but the amount of sex I had sure did. Because it let me hear again - but in an entirely new way. That physical connection bypassed my ears, opened new pathways. During, I could hear the things they wanted. Like *really* wanted. Made me good. Made me great. I felt like I mattered for the first time because now I wasn't just part of the conversation - I was the *fuckin'* conversation.



Mind reading. Telepathy. ESP. 



Used my old ID (still worked) to get into the school library and research. Different theories. Is it 'cause I wanted to hear again that badly? My body found another way and changed the math of my senses? Or maybe it's like turning off the lights? Going through the room turning off this lamp, then that lamp. No halogens, fluorescents, or LEDs, the junk that disconnects us from the natural world. 



You see the shadows. The dark. The truth. 



The theory I liked the most is that all around us, all the time, there are different frequencies that hide whole worlds we just can’t access. You could be at your sink washing a dish and right next to you a little grey man is breathing in your ear. You’re none the wiser, you’re dialed into mundane chore world. Not his alien one.



Now I could hear the shit you think but don’t say. Straight from the source. Farm-to-table thoughts and feelings. No preservatives or PC bullshit. The mask was fuckin’ off. 



Of course, I started charging for my bedroom skills. I was one in-demand ho for a good eight months.



But in true Dolphin Don style, I found a way to screw it up when I met Miss CEO. Her head full of running numbers which at first bugged, until I figured out what they were. I used them to play the market. Got on her radar. She didn't know how, but was smart enough to know it was me. Had her heavies make sure my left knee had less cartilage than my inner ear. Scumbags with crewcuts. Bacteria. Same thing.



That's how I found myself sniffing around at shitty dive bars for clients. Now less of an “in-demand ho”. Screwed-up knee made staying in shape hard, plus my usual swankier haunts were no-go’s. That and I was drinking again which made things hard…and soft. 



It was last week when I was at my lowest. I’d seen her a couple of times, but beggars can be choosers, I guess? Bug-eyed buzzed, yet she still drank shitty bar coffee. Talk about bacteria. Her type takes a lot out of me, it's like listening to two squirrels in a bag, trying to decide what position she'd like. She looked like she was touching a live wire and it was still cranking through her. Energy field of a power line overhead. *Zzzzzzzzz.* 



Although, an hour before my cell had just been cut-off, and when the client is that visibly frantic it sets the table for a smoother intro.



""Honey, you look like you need something to take the edge off?” I said.



She looked at me like I'd screamed in her face.



“Let me scoot in beside ‘ya, so you can lay it on me.”



And I sat, leaned in like I was interested. Pretty quickly she began babbling about her job. Made out what I could. Her lips moved fast so I had to rely on what I could pick up with my bad ears. 



Her name was Sharon. Worked in a museum? Just got back from a castle in Europe? Had trouble with her team. Cutting to the chase - a work trip took it out of her. Easy. A familiar context I could work with. 



After twenty minutes of compassionate head nodding, I laid out my terms.



Honestly, Sharon impressed me. She was down. Said she wanted to do it right then and there. How about the ladies?



Fine by me. One stall still locks.



At first all I could hear was the hollow thud of the metal partition we were up against. I was focusing on getting in there - it was tough, until finally I tuned in and — 



It wasn't her in there. 



It was a crowd. More maybe. Lots of different voices. Young. Old. Male. Female. Whispering, screaming, laughing. 



Gibberish? Except I knew it meant something. It just felt like…it didn’t exist. Not yet. Not now. 



And soon it felt like it was entering me. I could see it in the sweat of my arm. The sound was real, an oil slick my pores were sucking up.



I had to let her go, backing up, my knees buckling, grateful my ass had the closed toilet to land on. Sharon looked down at me, confused, but realizing fast something was up.



No wonder she looked like she'd crawled through a hedge. I'd be a psycho too with that shit in my head all the time.



Sharon leaned down real close and took me in. She was here with me because I was mirroring back her own shellshocked, bug eyes. I was sharing the chaos of her mind and it had slowed her down. 



She stood back, still looking at me. Finally she reached for me, angling my face toward her. I could read her lips since she’d finally slowed down.



""Did you hear it?”



I didn't answer. Should've lied, but right then it was hard to think enough to try.



""And you're still here,” she said, like I'd passed a test that most had bombed. She was impressed which felt good, but that faded fast.



I was up and out of there - hoofing it, while she grabbed at me, pulling her jeans up with her other hand. Her voice vibrating asking to explain *everything*. Show me what it all meant. 



But I couldn’t then. I always needed a minute after. This time, though, wasn’t rest, it was triage.



The minute I got home, I fell to my knees. On all fours I crawled to bed, keeping my keys in my hand so as I moved forward I could feel their teeth in my skin. Pain keeping me in the moment so I could reach my mattress on the floor.



I got there, and instead of stretching out, my body decided different, automatically tucking my knees under me. Arms stretched out. Head bowed.



Did Sharon's brain chaos scramble my DNA and turn me into a yogi? Whatever it was - I passed out quick.



And I dreamt. 



Back at college. Hands releasing my legs, righting myself after a keg stand. I threw my head back and squeaked - as high-pitched as I could go. Back to perfect. Except —



No one was looking at me, they were talking and laughing - and I couldn't hear a thing. Silent mouths moving. Lips pulling back showing teeth. Opening and closing. Sound sucked out of the room, until I saw a blast from the past. 



Miss CEO in her couture skirt suit, but chugging from a solo cup. The first one to clock me - and she started laughing.



And I could hear it, it was loud. She was a goddamn trendsetter, in seconds everyone had turned and were joining in. Louder. To my right this bozo was laughing so hard he was hacking in my ear - stinging like a newbie nurse trying to find a vein. The noise had weight and shape - and it hurt like a mother.



I turned on him, putting my hand over his mouth. Muffled, but still laughing, his eyes wide. Now tearing up at how laughable I was. 



He's not stopping. Worse, actually, he’s going the distance. 



He's gulping, sucking my hand into his wide open laughing mouth. Soon, I'm up to my forearm into this asshole. The shape of my arm gurgling down his throat.



Whatever he's made of - his saliva feels like acid peeling my skin. I'm freaking out trying to pull free, his choking laughter slicing into my arm, getting into my bloodstream.



I woke up already over the toilet. Heaving like a dog after eating one of the 900 no-no's they can't handle.



Now I know my body must have been getting rid of that sound, but right then - I was left with feelings I’d tried to forget, but couldn’t let go of.



Sitting back on the cold tile facing the toilet gurgling like that guy in my dream with my fist down his trachea.



Those voices in her head, that dream, it's making me think of my eardrum perforating. Getting called in by Coach to kick me off the team. Asking him to repeat himself so much he pulls up a chair to get nose-to-nose with me.



*Huh?*



*What was that?*



On the outside, not knowing what the fuck is going on.



Teachers. Recruiters. Friends. A girl you actually thought was funny. They sigh, having to repeat themselves for the reject. The loser who still hangs around even though he's now useless.



Which I'm not. I know what you're thinking before you can even say it, I know fuckin' everything.



*Remember?!*



So that's why I went back to the bar. I'd gone too far, from nothing to everything. Silence to something. Just like swimming. Impossible to swim backwards, you can only turn back once you get to the end of your lane, Coach always said. Until then you keep fuckin' going.



Sharon’s sitting in her usual place drinking her bacteria brew. Her eyes pinballing, until they finally focused on me.



""I knew it,” she sighed in relief.



Drove me in her dented sedan to the middle of nowhere. A new development that used to be a field - still might be - I smelled manure. Sharon's place looks like the only occupied house in the cul-de-sac. Light on in the middle of the darkness.



Inside it's show home perfect with plastic laminate floors pretending to be pricier bleached wood. Fake plants looking like dried twigs in big urns. The walls covered in black-and-white prints that feature just a splash of color. Pink flower petal. Red balloon.



Without a word she takes me upstairs, where a coat rack waits on the landing. Not by the door where it should be, but up here on the second floor, where it shouldn’t. There's shiny yellow rubber boots beneath. She takes a matching raincoat from the rack. Puts them on.



""We going back outside?"" I ask her.



She puts the hood up and puts her finger to her lips. *Shhh*.



Motions for me to follow her down the hall. I'm guessing to the master bedroom, this a fetish thing? Dang, are we getting wet? Whatever. If it means she tells me what's going on then I've done worse.



She opens the door, and stops, wanting me to go ahead. I pass her and almost immediately feel a rush of air as she closes the door behind me.



A moment to clue in before I'm trying the knob. Locked. I picture her on the other side, her head against the door. Waiting.



For me to find out what’s in her head. 



I turn to the dark room, shadows and moonlight reveal an empty room with a big stone just plonked down in the middle. 



I step towards it, doing a loop checking it out. It’s not leaving a dent in the creamy carpet like it should. Like I am. 



I lean down and see movement. 



In and out. In and out. It’s breathing. It’s a person. 



A guy? Although he’s smooth, no pores, or the ridge of a spine. Like someone sketched a human being and got lazy with the details. 



Had my abilities graduated from hearing to seeing? Those “higher vibrations” I’d read about pulling back the curtain on whatever this guy was…



He’s on his knees, head bowed, arms out, rounded back. Can’t help but remember how I passed out last night. 



Without moving his body, he raises his head, opens the round hole of his toothless mouth and spews like I did that morning.



Long ropes of sick, and I hear it loud and clear 'cause it's sound.



Solid sound.



Sending out shockwaves that make the paint on the wall bubble and flake. It’s rippling towards me like the tide, and like I'm testing the temperature to see if I should dive in.



I step into it. Just the tip of my toe, which in an instant -



Is gone.



Like someone took a cleaver that sliced clean through layers of shoe, sock, skin, muscle, bone. The pain revives that legendary Dolphin Don squeal - except I don't see a keg stand.



Surge of adrenaline sends me backwards straight into the door. Slamming into it with all my weight. Cheap pressboard folds out, and Sharon must have been against the door like I pictured because now she's on the ground with me.



At the bar she was impressed but now she looks disappointed. I feel bad for letting her down, but my feelings change in a microsecond - and I hope she saw pure, white-fucking hot hatred as my eyes peel away to the cornea then *zilch*.



That sound entered my cells and pried me open. I exploded, hence Sharon's raincoat.



She was hopeful, but there was always a chance of showers of my blood and guts.



I'm now one of those voices I heard in her head, just one of many. No ears. No voice. No body, but I weirdly know everything. We all used to be people but then…we got peeled layer by layer until - *poof*. 



I watch Sharon drinking her coffee, looking for others who could potentially contain it like her. And if not they end up collected - just like me.

After a weekend cooped up from the weather, we’re eager to ride together again on Saturday! The forecast is still a little chilly, but it’s nothing some layers and some pedaling can’t fix! We’re starting South this week, on a gracious invite from The Salty Donut who are offering all of our riders 50% off coffee and tea purchases to help us begin warm and caffeinated! 

Instead of our usual start ->park stop -> end stop format, this week we feel compelled to unite with our fellow cyclists and merge with the ride in solidarity with Minneapolis. ***We’ll get some miles in together as the Caffeine Cruise, then make our way to East Side Pedal Pushers around 1pm for a little time to socialize and refuel before the 1:30pm wheels down.*** 

Leader: Holly

Start: @thesaltydonut 2000 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704

Wheels down 11:45am

End: East Side Pedal Pushers to join @blackhistorybikeride solidarity ride; wheels down 1:30pm. More Info: https://www.instagram.com/p/DUBdPjOAEf0/

Gravel: a little bit, but nothing a road bike can’t handle! 

Bring:  Sunscreen, lights, locks, ID, and money for snacks/drinks.

Social Cycling Austin rides AS traffic and NOT AGAINST it. We stop at red lights, yield the right of way and let cars pass as best we can. We don't block intersections. We are nice to both our fellow riders and the other traffic on the road. LISTEN TO the volunteers helping to lead the ride. They are some nice folks and have your best interest in mind.

If you have any questions about the rules, see: \[https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/docs/TN/htm/TN.551.htm\]

REMINDER: The goal has always been to create a safe environment for all riders, but we cannot control, nor do we desire to, every rider's behavior. We promote personal responsibility, and it is each rider's responsibility to take care of themselves, and if they choose to ride with us, then they accept those risks inherent in riding a bicycle with a large group of other people riding bicycles.

The job is demanding but the schedule gives me four days off, and I make good money with overtime and differentials.

I started gambling online two years ago. My first year I broke even. Last year I finished up $19,000. The biggest change was when I started paying attention to when I play.

**Your mental state affects everything.**

After a rough shift, I used to unwind with a few hands of blackjack. I lost consistently. I was tired, emotionally drained, and making poor decisions. Now I have a rule: no gambling within six hours of finishing a shift. Fresh mind only.

**Find your sharpest hours.**

For me, it is mid-morning on my days off. I have slept well, had coffee, and I am alert. I noticed my win rate is significantly higher during these windows compared to late nights. Track when you play and when you win - you might find a pattern.

**Shorter sessions, better focus.**

I keep sessions under 90 minutes. After that, my concentration drops. I would rather play three focused one-hour sessions than one sloppy four-hour marathon.

**Have something else to do.**

If gambling is your only entertainment, you will play when you should not. I have other hobbies. Gambling is one option, not the only option.

I play on [Casin0x](https://casin0xvip.com/) because it fits my odd schedule. Live dealers at 10am on a Tuesday, no problem. Withdrawals process quickly so I am not tempted to play back my winnings.

Know yourself, play when you are sharp, stop when you are not.",1,1769563821.0,u_BudgetGambler63,0,1.0,False
