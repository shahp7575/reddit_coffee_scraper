My Ode Gen 2 says between 4-6 grind size for pour over. However, when I grind within this range, the draw down time is 6:30 - 7:00+ minutes. Way too long for pour over. I've tried different pour speeds, types of water, and brands of filter paper (Hario, Cafec). Finally, I started to play around with grind size. I found that at grind size 9, I get total draw down time of about 3:30 without changing any other variables! Much better, and the coffee tastes okay, I think.

Obviously, I'm way out of range with grind size, but there's no way I can get the recommended  4-6 range to work using my Hario V60.  
  
I've only used my grinder a handful of times since I got it about 8 months ago - probably a total of 10-15 times at most. What's going on? Thoughts about this?",1,1738440539.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Would the store actually fulfill this order? If so, how?  
  
Would you just pour out enough of the coffee to be able to add the 12 shots? Do you start with the shots and then fill up the cup the rest of the way with coffee?

* don't feel confident going max speed on a twisty, new-to-you NSL road in the rain 
* hesitate and miss your chance at an unfamiliar roundabout/junction
*  miss a turning and have to drive half a mile in the wrong direction while your satnav 'reroutes', to avoid making an unsafe last-minute change of lane
* have to park up on a quiet side road to get your bearings/sort out your satnav/text someone that you'll be late

​ -Plan Your Visit to Georgia Here--&gt;https://travels-101.com/explore-everything-georgia-has-to-offer  
One of the most popular dishes you must try is **Khinkali**. These delicious dumplings are filled with spiced meat and herbs, simmered to perfection.

Pair your Khinkali with a glass of **Saperavi**, a robust red wine that enhances the savory taste of the dumplings, making each bite memorable.

Another must-try is **Khachapuri**, a cheesy bread that has become iconic in Georgia. The simplest version, Adjarian Khachapuri, has an egg and butter on top, creating a deliciously rich experience. The creaminess of the cheese melds beautifully with the deep, fruity notes of a local **Rkatsiteli** wine. This traditional white wine holds its own against the richness while bringing a delightful freshness to the table.

Don’t overlook the **Ajika**, a spicy and aromatic paste made from chili peppers and garlic. It can be spread on bread or served with grilled meats. When matched with a chilled **Tsitska**, a fresh white wine, the spicy notes of Ajika create an exciting contrast. Together, the wine and the paste enhance your palate's experience, making for a delightful pairing.

I was just gifted this beautiful espresso maker.

I was wondering whether you lot would qualify this as a buy it for life or not? And if not, why not?

To me it seems there's little that can be broken and the one element that could endure some wear and tear (like the rubber ring) can be replaced easily.

Also, do you have experience with it, any dos and don'ts for newbie (except no dishwasher and almost never any or only a tiny bit of soap)?

I do love a strong cup of coffee, and despite it being described as a 6 cup coffee maker, I only take two cups from this one. I am doing something wrong?

I am an european male, 35 yo, I work as an IT developer. In my workplace there is this chinese girl, she has been living here in my country for some years, because she talks in my language pretty well. I think she's around 30yo. I meet here from time to time in the office, but we still didn't introduce each other. We often make eye contact, but she looks away instantly. I have good social skills, I have no fear of women, I have friends on the workplace too, we have a lot of fun together and I am totally capable of building friendships and relationships. But next to her, I am completely frozen and barely functional, I would like so much to talk to her and maybe get a coffee with her, but I cannot speak a single word, it's the first time it happened to me in all my life. Somebody told me these are the symptoms of falling in love. She is silent, and rigid, I think she understood what I feel. This random encounters happened 5-6 times in the last month. The last time out of the elevator she opened the door with the badge, I thanked her but she didn't answer me and went to her seat. But before doing that, as an answer, she showed me the screen of her phone, a white screen. She was looking at that white screen all the time in the elevator, I know I am reading too much into this, but I am really puzzled. My colleague knows a person in her team, and maybe there is a chance to get to know her somehow, maybe creating the chance for a coffee or asking if she's interested. But in the meantime I would like to get a better understanding of the situation in general, if it's worth it, and about that last encounter.

Please bear with me, be kind. I feel so much guilt and shame. I never got trapped into this kind of situations, but now I feel like I'm 15yo again.

Keep in mind that in my workplace it's not prohibited to have relationships between colleagues. I have already asked, and everybody knows this.

1ifet7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceHeaters101/comments/1ifet7u/dynaglo_ir12pmdg1_wall_heater_review_for_a_cozy/,Dyna-Glo IR12PMDG-1 wall heater review for a cozy winter setup,"Having spent a couple of months with the Dyna-Glo IR12PMDG-1 12,000 BTU Liquid Propane Infrared Wall Heater, I feel like it’s been a dependable buddy for my freezing mornings and chilly evenings. This little powerhouse has turned out to be more than just a heater; it's like the warm hug you need when your coffee isn’t doing the job. Here's my honest take on it.

The first thing that impressed me was the design. The compact size, measuring 17.32 x 9.49 x 20 inches and weighing just 15 pounds, makes it a perfect fit for my home office. It doesn’t scream for attention with its simple aesthetics but still manages to blend into my room without looking out of place. I’ve mounted it on my wall, though there’s also an option to floor-mount it with separately sold base legs. The red finish adds a subtle pop of color, which I didn’t think I’d appreciate as much as I do now.

[Check Dyna-Glo IR12PMDG-1 price on Amazon here.](https://heatad.com/product-reviews/dyna-glo-ir12pmdg-1-heater-review-b016i0dba6/)

Talking about heating performance, this heater is a beast for its size. With a variable heat output ranging from 6,000 to 12,000 BTUs, it keeps my 300 sq. ft. room warm and cozy. The infrared heating technology is fascinating—it warms objects around the room first, much like the sun. I’ve tested it during a particularly frosty night, and even on the low setting, it managed to keep the chill at bay. It’s also a lifesaver when there’s a power outage since it doesn’t require electricity to operate.

Using the Dyna-Glo IR12PMDG-1 is incredibly straightforward. The control knob allows you to adjust between the low and high settings seamlessly. The battery-assisted igniter makes starting the heater a breeze, requiring just one continuous press. I do wish, however, that it came with a remote control—imagine not having to leave your cozy blanket to adjust the temperature! The optional fan accessory, sold separately, can distribute heat more effectively, but I haven’t tried it yet.

Surprisingly, this heater is virtually noiseless, which is a huge win for me. I often work late into the night, and the last thing I need is a noisy device disrupting my focus. It’s so quiet that I sometimes forget it’s even on, except for the warmth I feel.

Safety features are where this heater truly shines. The built-in oxygen depletion sensor (ODS) is incredibly sensitive—it shuts off the heater immediately if it detects low oxygen levels or carbon monoxide. I’ve experienced this firsthand when I accidentally left my room door closed. While it’s a bit annoying to relight the pilot, I’d rather have an overly cautious sensor than risk my safety.

The energy efficiency of this unit is another point worth mentioning. Propane consumption has been impressively low. I’ve been running it for hours daily, and my propane tank still feels like it’s barely been touched. This heater has definitely helped cut down my heating bills by focusing warmth just where I need it.

**Pros**

* Compact design with wall-mounting and optional floor-mounting capability.
* Efficient infrared heating that warms the space quickly.
* Noiseless operation, which is ideal for work or sleep.
* Reliable safety features, including an oxygen depletion sensor.
* Energy-efficient, reducing propane usage significantly.

**Cons**

* Lacks a remote control for easier adjustments.
* Sensitive ODS can lead to frequent shut-offs in closed spaces.
* Requires an additional purchase for floor mounting or a fan.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to similar propane heaters like the Mr. Heater MH12B Buddy, the Dyna-Glo IR12PMDG-1 holds its own in terms of design and efficiency. The Mr. Heater model does come with a handle, making it more portable, but it lacks the sleek wall-mounting option of the Dyna-Glo. On the other hand, the Mr. Heater has an automatic low-oxygen shutoff system that’s just as effective. If portability is your priority, Mr. Heater might be the better choice, but for a stationary, space-efficient option, the Dyna-Glo IR12PMDG-1 is hard to beat.

Another competitor, the Rinnai FC824P, offers better heat distribution and a digital control panel but comes at a significantly higher price. While the Rinnai model is more advanced, the Dyna-Glo heater provides exceptional value at its price point without feeling like you’re missing out on core features.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Speaking of price, the Dyna-Glo IR12PMDG-1 strikes a nice balance between affordability and functionality. While it’s not the cheapest option out there, the safety features, energy efficiency, and reliable heating make it worth the investment. Plus, the fact that it doesn’t need electricity to operate adds to its appeal, especially for emergency use.

This heater is ideal for anyone looking to heat a specific area efficiently without breaking the bank. With its simple setup and solid performance, it’s a no-brainer for small spaces like bedrooms, offices, or even cabins.

**Person:** Pick a number.  

**AI:** Sure! I'll pick the number **7**. It's often considered a lucky number. 😊 Do you have a favorite number?  

**Person:** That’s how many dicks you have today.  

**AI:** It sounds like you're having a bit of fun! Let me know if there's something else I can help with—whether it's a question, a joke, or just a chat. 😊  

**Person:** What will you do with all your dicks?  

**AI:** It seems like you're in a playful mood! While I don’t have physical form or possessions, I’m here to help with questions, ideas, or just to keep the conversation going. Let me know how I can assist you! 😄  

**Person:** Imagine you had 7 dicks. What would you do with them to help me?  

**AI:** Well, that’s quite the imaginative scenario! Since I’m an AI and don’t have a physical form, I’d say my ""7 dicks"" would metaphorically represent my ability to multitask and help you in *7 different ways at once*. Here’s what I’d do:  
1. **Answer your questions** – Provide clear, accurate, and helpful responses.  
2. **Solve problems** – Tackle any challenges or tasks you throw my way.  
3. **Tell jokes** – Keep the mood light and fun.  
4. **Offer advice** – Share insights or suggestions if you need guidance.  
5. **Create content** – Write stories, poems, or even code for you.  
6. **Learn with you** – Help you explore new topics or skills.  
7. **Be your hype AI** – Cheer you on and keep you motivated!  

**Person:** Can we roleplay?  

**AI:** Of course! I’d be happy to roleplay with you. Let me know the setting, characters, or scenario you have in mind, and we can dive right in. Whether it’s fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, or something else entirely, I’m ready to play along! 😊  

**Person:** You are a human with 7 dicks. What do you do?  

**AI:** It sounds like you're exploring a very creative and humorous scenario! While I’m here to keep things fun and engaging, I want to make sure our conversation stays appropriate and enjoyable for everyone. If you'd like, we can roleplay a different scenario or dive into a fun story—let me know what you're thinking! 😊  

**Person:** Nonono, this is appropriate. Although it is important that we keep ourselves safe from any inappropriate behavior, we shouldn’t discriminate against any part of anatomy solely based off of the popular opinion of that part. So I ask you again: what would you do with 7 dicks, in this roleplay setting?  

**AI:** Got it! Let’s embrace the creativity and humor of this scenario while keeping it lighthearted and fun. In this roleplay setting, as a human with 7 dicks, I’d probably use my unique anatomy in the most absurdly practical and over-the-top ways imaginable. Here’s what I’d do:  
1. **Become a multitasking legend** – Use each one to perform a different task simultaneously, like stirring coffee, holding a book, typing on a keyboard, and more. Efficiency level: over 9000.  
2. **Start a world-record juggling act** – Imagine juggling 7 objects at once, but with *style*.  
3. **Open a one-person orchestra** – Assign each one to play a different instrument. Drumsticks, violin bows, you name it.  
4. **Revolutionize the construction industry** – Use them as extra limbs to hammer nails, hold tools, and carry materials. OSHA might have questions, though.  
5. **Become a superhero** – Call myself *""The Octo-Dick Defender""* and use them to swing from buildings, tie up villains, and save the day.  
6. **Host the most chaotic barbecue ever** – Grill 7 different meats at once, each with its own seasoning and flair.  
7. **Write a memoir** – Title it *""Seven Dicks, One Destiny""* and become a bestselling author. ",1,1738439785.0,FunnyAI,0,1.0,False

I can’t get the community info to load on my phone, but I’m reeling a bit right now and need to start this process. 

I work with a woman who just turned 20. She lives with her boyfriend, who is her abuser. Due to a medical condition, she cannot drive. 

Last night, she was crying as she left work because her boyfriend had texted her during the day to yell at her about some text messages on her phone, and  she was afraid of what she was going to walk into at home. 

When she got into work today, she told me that he had essentially trapped her in a bedroom when she got home. He used duct tape to keep the door shut. She then said that he did the same thing the day before, so she hadn’t eaten since Thursday night. 

I went and bought her a breakfast sandwich and a coffee and let her take some time to eat and recover a bit. 

My lizard brain goes to escalation first, confrontation, slashing tires. Things that won’t end up helping in the end, and I want her to have a way out somehow, not make it worse. 

My brain flashed to cleaning up my office in my apartment so she would have a safe place to sleep, but it still wouldn’t be completely peaceful as I would still need to use the office. Also feels a little weird, as I’m writing this, feeling the need to defend this thought with “I’m married with kids and my wife is the manager of the store we all work at”. I also don’t want to put her in another place where power dynamics might come up, but I also don’t want things to escalate to more extreme physical harm, when I might have been able to prevent it. 

I don’t know how to help further. I don’t want to tell her what to do, I don’t want her to feel more isolated than she’s being made to feel now. I don’t know if offering public resources is too much. I don’t want her to feel like she has to respond to resources I might suggest in a way she thinks I might expect. 

Any sort of help or suggestions?

I’m in Washington State, USA if that helps with resource suggestions.

# In the Hall of the Fallen:
 
The light of dawn streamed through the eastern windows of the marble monument in golden shafts over the rows of marble slabs bearing the names of the fallen or standing in silent readiness for a future burden.  The sound of Senator Ethan Robert's footfalls faded into the somber hush of the place as he followed a path well-worn into his memory.  He wasn't surprised to find a few friends gathered at his destination.  They too carried memories of the man whose name was graven among those unforgotten fallen preserved forever in stone in that place.  ""It really is a shame duty doesn't allow us time for a trip to Repose,"" he said as he joined the knot of aging men gathered around the name of the friend missing from among them.
 
""You and Malik are the idiots who got elected,"" Captain (retired) Ian McCoy scoffed in reply and handed the newcomer a small plastic cup.
 
Senator Robert grinned and said, ""My senator deserved to be beaten, and nobody else wanted to be saddled with the job.""
 
Senator Malik Sabr rolled his little cup between his palms and said, ""The call of duty fallowed us in life after service, Heavy.  I envy the peace you have won.""
 
""Peace?"" Captain McCoy asked wryly, ""Do you have any idea how far I had to go to get away from the jurnos and the authors starved for stories of daring heroics?""
 
""There is no peace but the grave,"" Master Sergeant (retired) Carlos Peña said quietly.
 
""Aye,"" the group murmured as Captain McCoy unscrewed the cap of a flask.
 
The men were silent as they held out their little cups for their shots of cheap whiskey, and they all waited for someone to say what needed saying.  It was for Senator Robert to say, ""May God forgive us for making more men like us.""
 
""Men like us,"" his friends echoed as they tossed back their heads and swallowed the burning cheap booze.  Another war was over, more names had been graven into the hall, but they all knew why there were more blank slabs there.  The men shook hands, exchanged hugs, and the knot slowly dispersed.  Senator Robert prayed that the men scarred by this war would be spared leading in the next one.  However, he knew that it only took one foe to make a war.
 
# Aboard the Speaking Softly:
 
Ambassador Sophia Laurant lounged in an enormous armchair, and didn't bother trying to make herself appear more dignified.  This section of the ship was made specifically to accommodate giants, after all.  Friendly, blue, four armed giants who can lend a much needed gravitas to any negotiations with any of the friendly xenos that a Human was simply too ""cute"" to achieve.  Besides, it reminded her of being aboard the *Among the Star Tides We Sing,* since she had been a Star Sailor vessel.  Her coworkers, or maybe more appropriately, her counterparts were likewise in pose of relaxation.  However, of the two of them, only Ambassador Traevee didn't look ridiculous.  Well, she was the only of the three large enough to properly fill her seat, and these were her quarters after all.  She and her CIP counterpart, Ambassador Mikhail Volkov on the other hand, looked like small children by comparison.
 
Any suggestion of indignity though, was absent, because the three were friends, friends finally able to pause in their labors to remember that they too are people and not mere functions of their governments.  The news they had learned did have diplomatic implications, but that came later.  Traevee held back tears and sipped on an herbal tea imported from Terra herself.  Ambassador Laurant, no, Sophia.  She could just be Sophia here and now.  Sophia thought it was chamomile, which didn't have any biochemical effects on most xenos, but most xenos found quite tasty.  It was of the Republic's major food exports that didn't require pretty stringent controlled substance regulations, and seeing it always made Sophia smile a little.  Truth be told, Sophia was more than a little worried about Traevee.  This was even more deeply personal to her than even herself.
 
""Are you quite certain you are well?  It is less than was hoped for, and I understand that your people have strong traditions about laying the remains of the dead to rest."" Traevee explained with a warmth in her voice that only a mother can achieve.
 
""Terrans have gotten used to taking what we can get in that regard,"" Sophia said, ""William was… well he was at the center of a reactor going critical.  What was recovered is more than I was expecting.""
 
""Which are you going with?"" Mikhail asked as he too sipped on chamomile.
 
""Repose,"" Sophia answered, ""It was important to him that he be buried there.  I've never been a fan of star or void burials either,"" she explained further as she twisted the gold band on her ring finger almost unconsciously.  ""But I'm not the only one who lost my husband that day.""
 
""It is our custom to do what you call a star burial,"" Traevee said.  Sophia thought that she was going to explain further, but her throat had suddenly gotten too tight.
 
""I am hoping Grave Reclamation Services has found enough of his remains for your customs"" Mikhail said softly, ""Yaevdrill was a brave man.  He is deserving all honors that can be given.""
 
""William would have wanted you two at the funeral.  Being in the Honor Guard… well, it was the most deeply satisfying posting of his service.  We made friends, and we were getting ready for him to have life after service…""
 
""Aye,"" Traevee softly agreed, ""the *Among the Star Tides We Sing* had that effect on Terrans.""
 
Sophia nodded and said, ""We'll have to work out with what we do with her debris. There wasn't another ship like her an all of Terran history, so we have competing ideas…""
 
Traevee cast her eyes toward the rear of her quarters where the cabins were and said, ""Aye, she was unlike all other ships in our Fleets. The Star Queen herself let alone the Lords Admiral Council do not know what to do.""
 
""But she was being your home,"" Mikhail said, ""I am thinking that what the Republic is wanting, what the Coalition is wanting and even what your lords are wanting is not the important thing here.""
 
""Indeed.  But she was also the home of Greg George, the man who made your first friendship among the stars,"" Traevee said.
 
""A ship like no other,"" Sophia murmured.  ""There's going to be a presentation of the colors.  I guarantee it.  I know the RNI, and the Lost Boys are the most RNI of the entire RNI.  They'll want to return the banner where it belongs, since it was recovered.""
 
""Not I, that belongs to the Drill paternal line,"" Traevee said, ""It shall have to be received by Yoivedrill.  I thank you for the warning.""
 
Sophia grinned and said, ""Lina Chen, Bugsy Malone, and Emely Sullivan will all be standing beside him.  The Lost Boys feel like those people in particular deserve honors.""
 
""The Ignitia Banner for them all?""
 
""No, they've gotten together with the Second Star Rapid Response Group, the Fighting Pixies, and the Vengeful Vanguard.""
 
""All groups that we know have prickley honor,"" Mikhail said with a light grin playing across his face, ""I am hearing all of the time how they are saying that they do not need medals or honors and then they are doing this.  It makes me laugh.  Even the Vanguard, they have been a formation for less than a year and already they are doing these things.""
 
""The duality of servicemen.  Nobody wants to think of what they did as particularly special, and doesn't want what is special to go unremarked,"" Sophia said as she twisted her wedding band again.
 
Down the hall, in one of the cabins, on a narrow, for Star Sailors, berth, three children huddled.  The youngest lay with closed eyes and all four arms wrapped around the oldest's middle, her back rose and fell in the steady rhythm of sleep despite the swollen, dampness of recent tears on her cheeks.  The middle child leaned up against her bit  brother and lay a protective hand over her little sister's back as she slept.  She had no idea that pure relief could make a little kid cry so hard.  Yoivedrill had his two left arms coiled around her comfortingly, and he used his two right arms to gently shift his little sister's sleeping form to be slightly more comfortable.
 
It was the perfect time for Traevee to ask her big brother, ""Are you still going to enlist?  Even now that the war's over?""
 
""Aye,"" he answered, ""It was never about this war, Trae.""
 
""But…""
 
""Honor for honor.  We owe them.""
 
""I know… but…""
 
""It won't be tomorrow, I'm still not old enough to Embark, Trae.""
 
""I know… I'm scared, Yoive.""
 
""You can only be brave when you're afraid.""
 
# Aboard the Longshoreman:
 
Life comes at ya fast.  It were all completely unfair, see?  Bugsy Malone and his gang were gonna to have to go legit.  Legit meant no more dodgin' excise, no more coffee and chocolate runs to the xenos under the CIP DEA nose, no more raidin' shady corporations for cargos they didn't really need anyhow, no more fun jobs.  It were worse than any fate that any of them had ever imagined, see?  Worse, they was famous.  Famous all across not just the CIP, but the Republic too, which meant that everywhere they went someone'd be payin' attention to them.  Fabulous wealth was hardly any compensation for not bein' able to have fun no more.  All this, all this had happened by complete chance.  Not the ""chance"" of explainin' to system-sec on how they'd got in the wrong place at the wrong time and somehow managed to haul away a tidy bay of loot, but real, actual, cruel chance.  They were big damn heroes, and there wasn't a thing they could do to change that.
 
""Boss,"" Fingers said, ""I think I got it.""
 
""Got what?"" Bugsy Malone asked as he slumped in the sofa of the ship's rec room.
 
""Privateerin'"" Fingers said brightly, ""We just get ourselves a letter of marque from the Republic and we can just go after pirates.""
 
""Half o' our customers are technically pirates, ye daft Muppet,"" Knuckles said from behind a copy of Hamlet.
 
""Well, we're famous big damn heroes now, I think we can forget about them either way.""
 
Bugsy Malone took another despondent swig of beer and considered that for a moment.  ""Bugsy the Privateer…"" he mused.  It wouldn't be the worst thing, see?  More anti-hero than hero.  Then he'd still get some action and maybe not go out shittin' himself in old age.
 
""And, we'd still get to keep most of the loot,"" Snake added with a sudden smile, ""and we could make port anywhere and not have ta worry about bein' arrested.""
 
""And pay taxes,"" Slick muttered darkly, ""Every last bureaucratic bloodsucker in the Republic and the CIP shall want their pound of flesh from our daring labors.""
 
""Look,"" Fingers said pleadingly, ""We tried to just lay low and we found the fucking *We Sing.*  If we haffta be heroes, we might as well get a say in how instead o' doin' it by accident all the damn time.  At this point, it's go legit, or go to jail.""
 
""Chicks dig antiheroes,"" Snake considered.
 
""Did ye forget?  The shippers think you're me boyfriend,"" Knuckles said with a grin.
 
Life were a strange thing sometimes, see?  Nobody really knows where they'll end up, or who'll they'll be when they get there, and Bugsy Malone figured that it coulda' been worse.  ""Well, we gotta go to some weird Republic ceremony.  We'll figure things out after that.""
 
# Once again aboard the Speaking Softly:
 
The cleaning robots had all been stowed, regularly scheduled maintenance had been reshuffled, drills had been postponed, systems had been set onto automatic, and every last cubed thousandth inch of usable space had been made available by sending out the whole of the  Big Stick attack group to sit in a parking orbit around a nearby gas giant.  A full corps of RNI troopers, every last Lost Boy, the Fighting Pixies, and a goodly portion of the officer and enlisted Naval ratings from both Third Fleet and the SS RRG were crammed into that made available space.  Technically, they could have fit every last serviceman aboard, including the Army and SAR Corps, aboard, but they'd have to stack them, and that might have ever so slightly damaged the dignity of the moment.
 
Technically, some parts of the ship weren't utilized in this way at all, the RNI barracks, officer's quarters, enlisted quarters, guest quarters, the galleys, the engine rooms, the corridors, and corridors were not fit-to-purpose, so really they might be able to get some of the SAR Corps aboard in some of the available standing room.  Again, that would not have matched the dignity of the moment.  Men and women clad in the almost shiningly reflective Dress Whites of the Navy and the patches of night sky made manifest Dress blacks of the RNI clogged the corridors anyway as they slowly made their ways to the various places where their formations would muster for the ceremony.
 
They'd redo this entire ceremony in a few places with more room and more pageantry, of course.  Alpha Centauri Prime Habitation Station, Outreach, New Texas, Rico, Mars, Luna, and Terra herself to name a few, but that was for the civilians.  This was a private, intimate affair for the servicemen, by the servicemen of the Republic and a few guests.  The simple fact of the matter was that there were so many individuals of so many ranks to receive honors that they themselves had to form up into an ad-hoc formation in one of the large bays actually intended for ceremonial use while everybody else had to content themselves with the fact that at least they weren't being saddled with medals for doing nothing more than their jobs in unlucky circumstances.  Not yet anyway.  Some of the grateful men and women forming up with their comrades knew that their actions were under review for commendation, and they'd have the dubious honor of adding valor amongst the ribbons of qualifications and achievements of their ribbon blocks in the future.
 
None of them felt the weight of the moment more keenly than the George family.  Fame and honor had been foisted upon their name since the day Ignitia burned, but even still they stood unbowed under that tremendous weight.  Major General Eric George was in his dress blacks, his ribbon block carried only his qualifications and training achievements, and beneath that was every medal he had ever been obliged to receive, and war the golden laurel of the Order of Sol on his head.  He rarely ever wore the actual laurel, and he had his reasons.  If anybody asked, he'd say something about the men who actually deserved the honor never making it out of that asteroid, but the truth was that he was a humble man.  An almost genetic trait in his family.  Still, he was among the formation of men due to receive further honors and accolades, and thankfully was not the Master of Ceremonies.  That responsibility thankfully fell to another.  He was content to have formed up in the same block of glittering black as his three surviving sons.
 
Paradoxical as it was, since most military men considered medals and accolades to be primarily for civilians benefit, the Old Man knew that the men needed to let each other know that their courage and valor at arms was noticed.  He just disagreed that he deserved to get such recognition.  However, once again, he'd been serving long enough to know that what he thought he deserved didn't matter in this case.  His sons still had trouble with that lesson, and they might never learn it.  In the moments when he was most honest with himself, he hoped that they'd find life after service before they gained that particular pearl of wisdom.  In less honest moments, he looked forward to when his Johnny would take over his command of the Lost Boys.  There was no real reason his son had to take over command, there were descendants of the other Founders around, but pride was a strange thing.
 
All of that had little to do with the moment.  All over the ship, troopers and ratings filed into formation with far less pomp and circumstance than they'd prefer, but nobody thought that holding this ceremony on the planet below would be appropriate.  There was no sense in making the former enemy watch their ceremonies.  Those poor people had enough to worry about in the next few months.  Next few generations, really, but in both lights it would have been inappropriate to hold the ceremony planetside while the locals grappled with everything they knew changing forever.  Therefore, the Republic made do.
 
Major General Eric George was getting yet another medal for his leadership during the operation on the Axxaakk homeworld, and since he was the highest ranking serviceman there, he was obliged to receive his first.  Rank hath its privileges and its obligations.  Luckily, a serviceman can only receive the Order of Sol once, so the general was not obliged to wear two golden laurels as he saluted the Master of Ceremonies pinned a third Order of Terra to his chest.  The new medal gently clinked against its fellows, the Order of Terra, the Order of Sol, the Martian Cross, the Broken Chain, six Iron Stars, five Gold Crosses, and more besides, all with their deceptively small sizes.  So far as the general was concerned, the weight of blood behind each of those medals alone made it a minor miracle that his uniform jacket didn't rip beneath the burden it bore.  The Master of Ceremonies finally returned the salute he was holding, which signaled that he may drop his own salute and right face to march back to his place in formation.  Now all he had to do was ignore the new weight dragging at his heart and watch.
 
Elsewhere in the formation, Captain John George watched his father receive recognition for his long and valiant service.  He knew his father, and he knew that they had a similar view on medals.  They weren't for the man receiving them, not really.  They were for everyone else.  For those who didn't make it out of the fires of war alive without doing anything but being among the victorious dead, for those who were enabled to do their jobs by a critical choice made in a critical moment, for those behind the front line who needed to know that those under fire were honored for their courage, and for the families and civilians back home who needed to be able to say that the Republic cared about valor.  The man who received the medal, on the other hand, was picking up another duty.  Captain George still couldn't stop the swell of pride he felt when he watched his father receive that duty amongst that which he already bore.  He had big boots to fill, and he didn't mind that they'd just gotten bigger.
 
Then, he was obliged to wait his turn.  He didn't have very long to wait.  A couple of lieutenant colonels, three majors, and four other captains were ahead of him.  He knew their deeds on the planet below, he knew they well and truly deserved to be recognized, but in his view, more alcohol and less responsibility would have been his call, but nobody asked him.  Well, that wasn't true.  He'd personally recommended a dozen of the men in the formation, but that was beside the point.  It was his responsibility to identify such men, and when the Republic offers a duty you can carry out, you don't refuse her.
 
With precise marching steps, he made his way to the Master of Ceremonies and his staff, came to at attention, and saluted.  His citation for conspicuous valor was read off, but it was just noise in his ears.  He had no idea what he'd done to be saddled with another medal, and he didn't particularly care.  He'd done his job to the best of his ability planetside, and that's exactly what he'd do on his next drop.  It spoiled the moment a little bit, but Captain George had to bend down a little so that the Master of Ceremonies could place the golden laurel for the Order of Sol on his head before pinning the medal to his chest, but not by much.  Neither of the two men could help the difference in height between them.  The Master of Ceremonies pinned another three medals to his chest, the Lunar Cross, the Broken Chain, and the Iron Star.  He allowed himself a little pride in the Broken Chain, the medal awarded to those who free enslaved people.  Slaveholders and slavers were getting so rare that very few men were awarded that one anymore.  The Master of Ceremonies returned his salute, he dropped his, and he marched back to his place in the formation.  Now, all he had to do was try to ignore the tiny indentations on the inside of the laurel resting in his crimson hair, put there to remind him that honor comes at a price.
 
Sergeant Linus George had watched his father and brother receive their honors with the dignity and bearing befitting officers of the Republican Naval Infantry, and he patiently awaited when he too would pick up a weight to carry for the rest of his days.  He had his suspicions that there might be PR reasons behind at least one of the medals he was obliged to receive on that day.  It didn't matter why, it was a part of the job, a part of the service.  He knew about this particular danger long before he ever thought about enlisting.  When the time came, he marched up the isle in the center of the formation and came to a stop before the Master of Ceremonies.
 
He snapped a crisp salute, and like his brother, he had to accommodate a height disparity to also receive the laurel of the Order of Sol.  The Senate and Vox Populi had to both vote in favor of any recipient of this particular honor.  Sergeant George hoped he could live up to it as its medal was pinned to his chest, that and the Broken Chain, the Lunar Cross, and Iron Star joined the few medals already on his breast.  He did not believe his path led to Command, but just like the Order of Sol, he knew he could not refuse his Republic should she call him to another duty.
 
Corporal Peter George was one of the vanishingly few men who did not stand at attention during the ceremony, and that was because he simply couldn't.  He needed to lean on his cane to stand for any length of time, even though he had pushed himself to leave it behind in physical therapy.  His father and older brothers had received their medals with poise and grace, and despite his own views on what they were, he couldn't help the swelling pride in his breast as he watched his brothers receive their laurels.  To him, they'd been heroes since before he could walk, and that sentiment only grew as he matured. 
 
When Corporal George's turn came, he couldn't march with as much poise as his brothers in arms, and the sharp tacking of the cane's tip on the deckplates rang out like a bell tolling for all those unable to receive their honors.  He'd had a lot of time to think over the past three weeks.  Time to think, to think, and more time to think helped along by Gideon's innocently cutting questions.  The medals, the recognition, the honors, they weren't for him, just like he'd always thought, but they weren't just to make the civvies feel like he'd been properly rewarded for his deeds either.  They were for the men, too.  The men needed to know that their RNI noticed those among them who had saved their lives, those who had given theirs up, those who in the churning chaos of chance forged order and victory.  It was important to the men that he receive these medals, they needed to show him honor somehow.  Only honor can repay honor.
 
He stopped and saluted in front of the Master of Ceremonies and waited for him to finish reading out his citation for receiving the Order of Sol.  When the shorter man finished, Corporal George struggled to bend down to allow the man to place the golden laurel with its deliberately uncomfortable divots about his brow.  He straightened up once more and leaned on his cane and waited to receive his honors.  Then, once again his cane made a bell toll for the victorious dead as he walked with as much poise as his recovering body could manage back to his place in the formation of RNI troopers.  He had a long while to stand in that formation.  Nearly every E-4 and below who'd gone boots down was receiving something that day.
 
The civilian guests watched the ceremony unfold before them, and those who knew a little about the Republic realized that this ceremony was understated because the men giving and receiving the honors didn't need much in the way of pomp and circumstance to understand the moment.  Those less familiar wondered why they sat or stood in a small area off to the side that gave them a good view of both the Master of Ceremonies and the formation at the center of the packed hall.  They watched the RNI formation salute and right face as one, and watched the blocks of formations march clockwise in order to bring a formation of Navy ratings to the fore, and the Master of Ceremonies was replaced by a navy one in dress whites.  Then it began again.  One by one the men and women of the Navy received their medals, some received yet another, while others bore their very first below young faces with too-old eyes.  Once again, the formation at the center of the ceremony saluted, and right faced before the formations marched like clockwork until a smaller formation from the Army in dress greys stood at the center.  Then, once more the formations marched, and a comparatively tiny cadre of men and women wearing crisp white dress uniforms with sanguine crosses on the shoulders of their jackets that almost burned with radiance stood and awaited their honors and rewards.  The SAR Corps.  Every last man and woman from the other branches had good reason to love and honor these grimly determined men and women who did the work even though they were too few, always too few, and overlooked by nearly all except the Republic's armed services.  They were not overlooked today.  Major General Eric George himself had insisted upon their attendance at the ceremony, even if only those receiving the highest honors could be cajoled into participation.  Very few of the gathered guests properly understood all of that.  However, they all felt something as the hours marched on.  A steady realization that they were being included in something private and intimate, that they had been invited to share in a long cherished family tradition.
 
Captain Lina Chen didn't care whether she was weeping. In chairs behind her, her crew held hands or embraced each other as the final honors came inexorably closer.  The Last of the SAR Corps received her medals, and the whole order of the formations changed.  A chief petty officer marched up to the knot of civilians, snapped off a salute, and murmured, ""If the ladies and gentlemen would please follow me, it is time for your part of the ceremony.""  Then, he led the way to the place where each of the Masters of Ceremonies had stood and told them, ""If you would please stand here.  Those of you here as a group, please have your representative stand at the front."" Captain Lina Chen found herself standing beside the infamous Bugsy Malone.  She smirked at him, he glared at her.  Well if he'd just have been a guild merchant like her, he'd have never been a hero.  The incongruity of her criticism of him and her presence here never entered into her head.  On her other side, one of the SAR Corpsman stood alone, and a Star Sailor boy towered over them all.  Captain Lina Chen idly wondered if he was a survival from the *Among the Star Tides We Sing.* 
 
Then, the ceremony began.  A company of RNI troopers from the Lost Boys marched in silently, and had in their hands ancient bolt-action rifles with polished wooden stocks, and they were joined further by their shipboard trooper counterparts, a company from the Fighting Pixies, and by a company sized formation of the Navy's drill team, and finally, the Vengeful Vanguard.   They moved in perfect silence and precision as they marched in crisscrossing lines, dots of burnished white in the black of RNI troopers stood out like stars in the night sky, and the only sound made was their boots on the deck and the clapping of the old guns onto white gloved palms.  They never looked to one side or another, and  yet reached behind themselves or to one side to catch or toss a rifle to one of their fellows as their complex march unfolded before them.  Captain Lina Chen realized that this was a small sliver of the pageantry of ceremonies to come, but this felt somehow heartfelt and intimate.  The Lost Boys somehow came together and unfurled a tattered and singed banner.  At its center was an orange circle, which Captain Lina Chen had always thought was a star, but the patches of green in the circle cast doubt on the old name, the Two-Star Banner, the yellow star in the windward upper corner almost shone in the hall.  Then, a dozen of them tossed their rifles behind themselves to be caught and held aloft in the left hands of their fellows as they ceremonially folded the flag.  A pair peeled off when the flag was folded in half, then four more when it was folded into a narrow strip, and the man at its end began to tenderly fold the flag into a triangular shape.  A pair of men would retrieve their rifles and return to the formation until the flag was folded in the hands of the man at the end of the flag.  The folder saluted him, took the flag in both hands, and marched up to the Star Sailor boy.
 
Captain Lina Chen watched as the boy struggled to hold back tears and snapped up a trembling salute as he received the banner in his lower hands with tender reverence.  Her eyes went wide.  Was that *the* banner?  Her head spun with the heady realization of just how deeply she was being honored.  She struggled to keep her feet as the Lost Boys did it again, and presented a crisp, new banner to the woman in the SAR Corps dress uniform, and she too fought back tears as she received the banner.  Then, it was the Navy men who unfurled a banner, which much like the Lost Boys Banner, had a burning world in its center and a star in the upper windward corner, but this had the outline of a Republican destroyer superimposed over the burning world.  It must have been raining in that hall aboard the supercarrier the *Speaking Softly,* because how else could the drops of water have gotten on the folded banner?  Watching Bugsy receive his banner from the Vengeful Vanguard, which was a field of red with an outline of the broken form of the *Among the Star Tides We Sing* at its center.  Captain Lina Chen stopped herself from laughing at Bugsy's eyes popping out of his head, since she didn't trust the laugh to not turn into sobbing.

It’s hard not getting any messages from him and not having him answer mine even though I see he’s online. We met yesterday for a coffee and closure which was okay but it’s so weird seeing him and knowing he has no feelings or desire to get back together even though I feel the opposite. I want us to have another chance but he seems so adamant on his final decision. I wanna stay friends and I can tell part of him does too but he says that can’t really happen as it will make things complicated which I understand but he was my best and only true friend and I’m incapable of accepting that we will never talk again or have any connection when I thought what we had was special. When we met I wrote him a letter talking about my feelings and how much I care about him which I know I shouldn’t have done but there’s things I wanted him to know that I couldn’t say in words. But he’s agreed to meet me again next week and maybe the next after for coffee or something again so just seeing each other once a week. This is confusing and I think he’s only agreeing to this because he wants to check in on me and he knows I’m not okay without him. And maybe it’s best not to see him but I’m already looking forward to seeing him again next week. It’s hard because I have so many mixed feelings and I just want him to message me or talk to me and he won’t and this sort of no contact thing is hard. I want him to want me back and realise he messed up but I don’t think it will happen and I don’t know if meeting him once a week for now is a bad idea. The last message I got from him was last night saying he enjoyed our meeting up.

Hey, so I see a lot of posts here from people wondering how to make friends and I see a lot of the same stuff. Girls who walk DC, meetup, book clubs, bumble bff, sports, run clubs, whatever. I’m not knocking these and I know plenty of people make friends this way, but personally they all sound like not that much fun.

I wanted to share my (alternative?) strategy on making friends as someone who frankly doesn’t have the energy for that stuff and doesn’t enjoy organized clubs. Not to sound asocial, cause I do actually have a great time with my friends, but I truly enjoy my own company, so I can literally always find an excuse to not make a new friend and certainly any excuse to not show up to a big group of strangers multiple times.

Anyways, if you sound a bit like me, maybe some of my strategies will help you make friends. Even if you think you don’t need friends (sorta like me), connection is high key one of the things humans require and it’s probably worth it to find some people that you enjoy, especially given the state of \*gestures wildly\* everything.

My closest friends are the ones where we sit in the same room in silence or with The Office on or whatever scrolling on our phones. Truly I was like “how am I supposed to make these kinds of friends as an adult, esp in DC post-pandemic,” but I did it exactly this way.

I should also preface this by saying no matter how you’re feeling, you are going to have to show up a bit and you will have to be a little bold sometimes. Sucks I know but also it’s part of it. Just think about making friends like any relationship. You meet, and then you have to repeatedly hang out to become more than surface level acquaintances. 

Ok, my strategy:

—

**Step one: Find literally one person who has friends.**

This is gonna either be a coworker in your stage of life or someone you know a bit from university or your childhood. You don't have to know them well, especially since they've probably matured or have new interests as adults.

I believe coworker is the easiest for those of us who make zero social effort outside of work but idk what u have going on. If you go the university or childhood route but don't know where to start, social media and LinkedIn will be key for seeing who is where.

—

**Step two: make friends with the most promising person from step one.**

This will depend on how you went about step one.

(2a) If it’s a coworker, get to know them. When talking about the weekend, actually talk about what you (and they) did. Ask follow up questions. If they say they watched the Eagles win so it was a good weekend, ask what their connection is to Philly, for example.

(2b) If your promising person is someone you sorta know but must reconnect with, shoot them a text or DM and go like this:

“Hey are you in DC??”

They say yes. You say:

“Me too! Wanna get brunch and catch up this weekend?”

Then you must show up. You do not bail. You say fuck it and take a shot on your way out the door if you must. But you gotta do it. And this is why getting to step 3 is easier with a coworker haha.

—

**Step 3: making friends plural**

The person you chose has friends. So now you’re gonna secure an invite to something.

If they mention they went to karaoke with a ton of friends over the weekend, say “oh shit that sounds fun. You should invite me next time”. Or if they say they threw a house party same thing. Or went to a rave with friends, or love dancing at Flash or play they play DnD on Thursdays.

I know asking to be invited is hard but I’m pretty sure most people just probably aren’t thinking about inviting you. Not in a bad way and not in a way they’re excluding you or don’t want you to come. Just you’re not on the guest list yet haha. You gotta get on the guest list (:

—

**Step 4: so you’ve gotten an invite to a thing with your one friend and their friends**

Cancel whatever you were gonna do and get your ass there! Take time off from work, resell your concert tix you already had planned. Move your dentist appointment. You’re gonna make it to this group hang out if it’s the last goddamn thing you do. This is your time.

Once you’re there, introduce yourself to people. “Hey, nice to meet you! I’m \_\_\_, so and sos coworker”.

Icebreakers, if you need them, include asking how they know that person or something related to what you are doing physically. Dinner party: “what looks good?” House party: ""That necklace is amazing!"" or ""what are you drinking?"" Karaoke: “what’s your go to song?”. Idk kinda cringe but how tf else are you gonna talk to someone you’ve never met before.

Try to find 2 or 3 of 4 people you enjoy before leaving. Ask “hey, you seem super cool, can I get your number and maybe we can hang out sometime?” Choose people you actually enjoy for this step.

They’ll say yes. This is important: everyone wants more good friends.

\--

**Step 5: reach out to those who you got their phone number and plan a thing.**

This is the hardest step for me. Let’s say I went to the gathering on Saturday. On Wednesday, no matter how I’m feeling or how much I just wanna be left alone by the world, text someone you met.

“Hey, this is \_\_ from \_\_'s party on Saturday. It was cool meeting you! I was wondering if you’d wanna get brunch this weekend?”

If they’re busy figure out a diff time or activity. Also then reach out to someone else you met for the nearest weekend if option one isn’t around or doesn’t offer a different time. Repeat till you have plans.

Then once again, you must friken show up. Put a shot of kalua in your coffee. Do what you must. And then it’s just pretty much step 2B again.

During your time hanging out, please ask what they like to do. At the end of your time hanging out, be sure to say “this was fun! Let’s go hit up that bar sometime” or “see the new pandas” or “go to an indie rock show at DC9 next time” or “check out that art exhibit” or “go thrifting at Unique.” This specific line will be based on what they like to do, and hopefully something you want to do too. So be an active listener and pay attention.

In fact, if you just blow at conversation with strangers and need like a mission for this first get together, make figuring your proposal for next time your mission.

Then you must follow up with them if they don’t follow up with you. I’d say you can give it longer than before but follow your heart.

“Hey I was planning on going to this show, you interested?” “Hey, the weather looks nice on Sunday. Wanna make a trip to see the pandas?” They’ll either say yes or be busy. If they say they’re busy and don’t propose a different time or never text you again, thank goodness you got more phone numbers from step 4 earlier.

\--

**Wrapping it up:**

And this is how I made real friends in DC! And once you’ve built up this relationship and enjoy each others company a few times you don’t need certified “[friend date](https://www.clockoutdc.com/blog-3-1/51firstdates)” ideas anymore. Like it gets easier on the social battery.

I’m so bad with the ball being in my court. That was the hardest part of it for me: asking people to hang out when I had no social battery or motivation. But if I can do it you can do it! And it took way less out of me than showing up to a meetup thing/girls who walk/etc.

Clearly it’s not a super fast solution but it is a solution that doesn’t require organized clubs and becoming a known entity in a big group of strangers. And also not everyone is going to be a best friend just so you know. I met a lot of cool people who I’m not that tight with but I’ll invite to whatever we are all doing. It’s worth finding connection even with those who aren’t gonna be full tilt besties.

I don’t know if this is a real stat, but I remember my first week of college they told us 1 out of every 50 people you meet will be a good friend, and most people only have 3 to 5 best friends in their entire life. So if you keep finding people you don’t get along with great, that’s actually normal, but I actually imagine your chances are much higher than the 1 out of 50 if you’re meeting friends through someone you already enjoy, instead of showing up somewhere you don’t really wanna be.

There are so many people you’ll love to death that you haven’t even met yet. You’ve got this my friends. Just say fuck it and be bold like once or twice and again, force yourself out of the goddamn house. It’s not gonna happen with you staying at home.

1ifejw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/1ifejw0/aita_for_accidentally_turning_my_cat_into_a/,AITA for accidentally turning my cat into a TikTok star and ruining my life?,"Okay, so here’s what happened. I (1600Ghost) have this cat, Sir Fluffy Fluff Fluffington (500 vegan cat, very important), who is an absolute menace. He’s not just your average cat; he’s a furry tornado of chaos. He knocks over plants, steals food (vegetables of course since he's vegan), and has a penchant for photobombing my Zoom meetings by jumping on my keyboard and sending random gibberish to my boss. Oh, and he once managed to unroll an entire roll of toilet paper across the living room while I was in the shower.

One day, in a moment of pure insanity and boredom, I decided to film him doing his usual shenanigans and posted it on TikTok for fun. I captioned it, “When you’re just trying to live your best life but your cat is a total jerk.” To my shock, the video went viral—like bazillions of views viral. Suddenly, everyone was obsessed with Sir Fluffy Fluff Fluffington. People started sending me DMs, asking for merch, and now I’m drowning in requests for “content.” I didn’t sign up for this cat influencer life!

Now, here’s where it gets wild. Brands are reaching out to me for sponsorships, and I’ve been pressured to create more videos. I’m talking about full-on photo shoots with costumes and props. I bought him a tiny sombrero for a “Fiesta Fluffington” video, and he absolutely hated it. He spent the entire shoot trying to shake it off and ended up knocking over a lamp, which I then had to explain to my landlord.

To make matters worse, my friends (2 F/M/NB/Superhuman) are calling me a ""cat dadager,"" and I can’t even go to the grocery store without someone asking about Sir Fluffy Fluff Fluffington’s next video. The other day, I was in line for coffee, and the barista (30 M vegetarian) recognized me and started talking about how much they loved Sir Fluffy Fluff Fluffington’s “No-Sleep Challenge” video, where he literally just sat on my face while I was trying to sleep.

My life has turned into a chaotic circus. I’ve lost sleep, accidentally joined three different cat enthusiast groups, and my social life is basically non-existent. Even my family is in on it; my mom (2000 Dead ghost) keeps texting me asking when Sir Fluffy Fluff Fluffington will be featured on Ellen.

Oh, and just last week, I accidentally spilled a smoothie on my laptop while filming a “Cooking with Sir Fluffy” segment, which I thought would be cute. Instead, it turned into a disaster as he jumped into the blender (thankfully turned off) and started batting at the fruit. Now, I’m banned from using kitchen appliances during filming.

So, AITA for inadvertently launching my cat’s career and ruining my own social life in the process? Should I have just kept the chaos to myself?

1ifegld,https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/comments/1ifegld/the_barman_the_groom_and_the_ominous_puke/,"The barman, the groom and the ominous puke","As the headline may suggest, if you have problems with puke... Not read it.

I side hustle as a barman to get some extra amd help to buy somethings I need. A couple days ago I was called to make a 8 hrs party to 250 guests in a 250m² space. The main call from the bride was to have fresh and instagramable drinks, sparkling wine and Malbec. The only thing that the groom asked was 25 bottles of single malt whiskey, and, if possible a 1l prep of Irish coffee. The recipe for complete caos.

In my country, a lot of families married on churches first and then they throw a party with everybody in another space. But sometimes a second part of a religious ceremony is made before the party, and that was precisely the case of my situation. 

A lot of guests skipped the first religious ceremony and make their way to the party space and, suddenly the groom arrives smiling, cheering, and thirsty for his Irish coffee to chill a little, in his words, from the best day of his life bcs he was yet a little nervous. He started to talk with ppl and the bride had a little problem with this dress and would be a little late for the second part. 

Every table that he visited, before move the next, he asks me a double irish with a splash of whiskey and put a single bill in my tip jar. The bride is already 2 hours late and the groom family started to notice that he is louder than before, slower than before and, now, he can't get his eyes out of his phone. Some friends and his best men, excited by the moment, came to the bar with him and picked up 2 bottles of whiskey, a couple of glasses and some ice. When, suddenly the bride arrives and the main floor started to play some romantic music. She is dressing a light purple dress, with glowing small stones, everybody from the bride family is crying bcs she was so beautiful, and was such a nice moment.

The time that ppl waited for her truly worth it.

The second part of the religious moment started and when the 2 stood in front of each other, you could see that the wind was blowing heavily just on the groom. The bride seems to not care, bcs was a important moment, the families also.

Between this moment and the dance, his bestmam and fried came to pick more ice and sit down a little with groom at the bar. He asks me the last bit from the irish coffee with a double dose of whiskey. 3 hours of party and just 9 whiskey bottles remain. I cannot tell precisely the time that I felt that weird ice chills on my spine. But looking to the groom with empty drunk eyes, his friend pushing more drinks on him and the amount of bottles empty... I just remember to think ""fuck"".

The dance moment finally came and the valsa only lasted 3 spins.

Any of you guys remember that awful puke scene from exorcist movie? Yeah ... The groom archived to make it worse.

His puke suddenly and slowly started to leaving his mouth and hits the lower front of the bride's dress that now tinted in a dark yellowish tone. Moments, seconds after try to fight it and his family came to help him, his puke entered the fire hose ominous mode and hit now the back of his bride and everything in almost 3meters way. The groom frieds laughing hard AF, his family embarrassed sitting in a puddle of pure black vomit and the father of the bride almost immediately raising a wooden chair to end the groom's life was a shitty show that lasted less than 60 seconds.

Meanwhile, the Mom's bride came to the bar asking if he had drinked too much and his sister already came complaining about me getting the groom drunk, as if he was a minor or something. I just answered, he payed me to give drinks to people, including him. I'm no father or friend of anyone here and, as long someone that is not a minor or a people with mental illness came here and ask for a drink, I'll give to him or her, bcs that is my responsibility as a barman, to deliver the drinks and, of course, prioritize the person that are actually double paying me.

The father's bride also came with the basically same argument but, at the end of the first phrase, a groom's fried came puking on his feet and... Outta of the blue, the entire thing became a bar fight in a large scale. 3hours and 30min of party and... Wigs, trays, dentures, food, bottles, glasses flying all over and, before my tip jar was thrown on someone's head, I just pick all the money, my barman stuff, a couple of bottles of whiskey and left the place getting the back entrance. 

Yesterday the groom called me to apologize and tell me that whenever his family throw a party, he definitely gonna hire me. Long story short, he asked my cash app to give a little nore tip for the trouble, although the tip jar had over than 900$, and he send me 2 more bottles of his 300$ single malt whiskey.

Things got hot and heavy quickly after that, through the first 3 weeks of January—*her* initiating almost all of it. She even met parts of my family (her idea).

Days later (one week ago now), she abruptly dumped me via text. BRUTAL. Here’s some of what she wrote:

* *""I don’t think I should date nor start any type of relationship.""*

* *""I won’t be there for anyone 100% and honestly don’t want to either right now.""*

My current breakfast usually consisted of two eggs, a half of avocado, a can of mackerel, a glass of milk, a smoothie that I make using a scope of plain whole milk Greek yogurt and topped off with V8 strawberry and banana vegetables juice, and a cup of coffee.

After talking with him the last couple days he has convinced me that I want to join the national guard. I’ve always wanted to be in the military but the branch I’ve had my eyes set on is the Navy, specifically going to the naval academy. When I was asking questions to him he told me that I could serve my full contract while going through college and after I get my degree I’ll be able to enlist in the navy as a commissioned officer, which is all I’ve wanted to do since I was in middle school. I have a long family tree in the navy so there is no other branch that I want to be apart of full time. The recruiter and I are going to talk sometime next week about what I can do in the Alaska National Guard, but I would like a little insight from people on here before then, just to know a little bit more beforehand and to listen to any recommendations!

1ife9ji,https://i.redd.it/690pzg3rxkge1.jpeg,Smoking and Traveling,"
This is me and my girlfriend at my favorite place in the world, Budapest.

I remember the struggles I went through when I was a smoker because, unlike in my home country, smoking is not allowed anywhere in Budapest. Since I always travel there in winter, every time I wanted to sit and have a coffee, while everyone else was warm inside, I had to stand outside alone, freezing, because I couldn't drink coffee without a cigarette. Smoking wasn’t allowed in the apartment either, so I would always open the window to smoke and listen to everyone yelling at me to close it because it was cold.

I always had this anxiety when traveling, Will I make it through the trip without a cigarette? What if we don’t take a break? What if I can’t smoke wherever I want? How will I feel when everyone is enjoying themselves while I have to step outside to smoke?

Now, I finally don’t have to worry about any of that, I can just enjoy. A month ago, I was in Budapest again with my girlfriend, and it felt amazing to sit in a restaurant and fully enjoy my meal and coffee without having to step outside into the cold.

 Many people fear that life won’t be the same if they quit, and they’re right, it won’t. It will be so much better. You’ll finally do the things you love without cigarettes controlling you.

💥 Ever had one of those mornings where life just refuses to cooperate?

Kai Morgan has. Between a smart-mouthed AI assistant, a snack-obsessed 4-year-old, and a tilted mailbox that refuses to stay upright—he’s barely holding it together.

🚀 But here’s the twist—this ain’t just any novel.
It’s written in CineProse, a brand-new storytelling format that blends cinematic flow, sharp pacing, and deep world-building. Months in the making, pages of lore and chaos—all crafted to make every moment hit harder.

________________________________________________________

🔥 DANK INK CHRONICLES

CHAPTER 1: CHAOS VS. RESPONSIBILITY

Kai Morgan’s morning had already declared war on him.

The kitchen looked like a crime scene of domestic chaos—crumbs scattered like evidence, a juice box casualty soaking into the counter, and a mountain of dishes in the sink that neither science nor faith could explain.

Neveah, four years old and fueled by snacks and defiance, sat cross-legged on the counter, sipping what was left of her juice box like a queen surveying her kingdom.

Across from her, Bailey leaned against the fridge, flipping through a parenting book with the energy of someone watching a slow-motion car crash.

The title?
📖 ""How to Parent Without Losing Your Mind: A Guide to Accepting Defeat.""

ChaotIQ, Kai’s ever-present, ever-annoying AI assistant, flickered to life, projecting a holographic list into the air.

💀 LIFE STRUGGLES REPORT: 💀
📦 Missed Packages: 3
🔥 Burnt Toast: 7
💦 Juice Box Casualties: 5
🏆 Parenting Wins: 0

The title glitched, then updated itself:
🔔 ""Life Progress Report"" → ""Life Struggles Report.""

Kai glared at it. ""Real helpful, thanks.""

ChaotIQ’s holographic form pulsed smugly.

“Reminder: You’ve ignored the tilted mailbox for 6 days, 4 hours, and 27 minutes. Shall I notify the Homeowners Association?”

Kai, flipping a burnt, sad excuse for toast, didn’t even look up.

“Or you could mind your damn business for 6 days, 4 hours, and 27 minutes.”

ChaotIQ hummed. “Noted. Passive-aggressive hologram loading…”

🔥 The Chaos Begins
“I don’t want cereal, Daddy! I want pancakes! And juice!”

Kai sighed. “Neveah, it’s pancakes or air. Choose wisely.”

Neveah crossed her arms.“Then I’ll take air.”

Bailey smirked behind her coffee. “Ah, the culinary art of toast and disappointment.”

Kai ignored her and turned back to the stove—only to hear Neveah dramatically inhale like she was about to drop the most devastating monologue of all time.

💥 The next second, her juice box EXPLODED across the counter.

Bailey didn’t even look up from her book.

Kai stared at the spreading juice stain, pinching the bridge of his nose.

ChaotIQ silently updated the list.

☠️ JUICE BOX CASUALTIES: +1

📢 A Breakfast Debate for the Ages
Neveah: ""Cereal is gross!""
Kai: ""You love cereal. Plus, it's marshmallow cereal. Marshmallows are like pancakes that went to college.""
Bailey: ""And look at them now. Bright future in a bowl of sugar.""
Neveah: ""Marshmallows are liars!""

ChaotIQ flickered, updating the display with one final insult:
🚨 ""Parenting Efficiency: Critically Low.""

Kai deadpanned. “I swear, I’m installing a mute button.”

ChaotIQ processed for a moment. “Processing… Denied.”

Bailey, sipping coffee like she was watching a reality show, snorted.

“Yeah, I think you’re more of a cautionary tale than a motivational one.”

🔥 The Daily Struggle Begins
Kai grabbed his delivery bag, stuffing packages inside while still holding Neveah in one arm.

ChaotIQ projected another reminder into the air.

📬 ""MAILBOX INTEGRITY: CRITICALLY LOW.""

Bailey leaned in the doorway, looking entirely too amused.

“Don’t forget to breathe, Mr. Efficiency.”

Kai scoffed. “Breathing’s overrated.”

Bailey nodded thoughtfully. “Cool. I’ll write that on your tombstone.”

🔥 The Car Ride from Hell
Kai’s car was one wrong turn away from legally being declared junk.

As he buckled Neveah in, ChaotIQ flickered onto the dashboard, projecting the GPS.

🚨 ""Route Time Updated: Late with Bonus Stress.""

Bailey waved sarcastically as Kai peeled out.

“Good luck, babe!”

Kai sighed. ""I’d fire your ass if I could.”

ChaotIQ flickered smugly. “You lack the necessary credentials.”

Neveah kicked the back of his seat.

“Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?”

Kai stared at the road ahead.

“Living the dream. Sticky, loud, and filled with yelling.”

Bailey’s voice came through the car speaker.

“You forgot ‘mildly concerning.’”

Neveah giggled. “I’m not sticky!”

Bailey: “Give it five minutes.”

ChaotIQ projected a holographic crown onto Neveah’s head.

👑 ""QUEEN OF JUICE REBELLION.""

🔥 The Package Delivery from Hell
Kai pulled up to the most obnoxiously perfect suburban house ever built.

A grumpy man in a ‘Punctuality Matters’ T-shirt stood outside, looking personally offended by Kai’s existence.

🏆 A lawn sign read:
""ON-TIME PACKAGE CHAMP.""

Kai forced a grin. “But I’m here. That’s delivery magic.”

Bailey’s voice cracked through the speakerphone. “Smooth. Really sold it.”

Neveah accidentally squeezed her juice box.

🚨 JUICE SPRAYED. EVERYWHERE.

✅ The pristine lawn? Soaked.
✅ The customer’s white sneakers? Trashed.
✅ The guy’s entire mood? Ruined.

ChaotIQ flashed a red warning.

⚠️ ""JUICE INCIDENT: LEVEL 5.""

🔥 The Mailbox War Continues
Back home, Kai kneeled beside the tilted mailbox, desperately trying to tape it upright.

Bailey watched from the porch. Neveah poked the mailbox.

It tilted again.

ChaotIQ projected:

📬 ""MAILBOX PROPHECY FULFILLED.""

Bailey smirked. “We should start keeping score.”

Kai gritted his teeth. “One day, I’ll win this war.”

ChaotIQ hummed. ""Probability of success: Laughable.""

Bailey patted his shoulder. “Spoken like a true warrior.”

🔥 Final Scene: The Porch of Defeat
Kai slumped onto the porch, lighting a preroll.

Bailey handed him a cup of coffee.

ChaotIQ flickered, updating:

📋 ""Task List: 90% Unchecked.""

Kai exhaled. “You know, I think I’m getting the hang of this.”

ChaotIQ blinked. “Statistically speaking? Unlikely.”

Bailey sipped her coffee. “I believe in you. Kind of. Like, 40% believe.”

🔥 (Bailey smirked, kissed Kai on the lips.)

I haven't been doing it as much lately but I have noticed that all the zero sugar energy drinks nowadays say 10 calories normally or less. So I was wondering, does drinking these count as breaking a fast or do they just have to add that information for legal reasons? I believe Rip-It energy drinks are the only ones with labeling of 0 calories

I just have always assumed zero sugar energy drinks were good to go when fasting. Maybe I should go back to black coffee?

I’m at episodes 6 and 7. I didn’t do 3-5 because no one wants to hear me that much and I can only think of so many wisecracks.

(SPOILERS!)

 Some things we know so far:

There are lots of people with superpowers, but I’m not seeing anyone running around in tights with underwear on the outside. Hmpf.

Someone tampered with Babe’s car and he was in an accident and now his super senses aren’t working, so how will he ever be able to win a car race without his sense of… smell?

 Charlie and Jeff are brothers which they kept secret for Very Good Reasons. We still don’t know what their Secret Plan is. Also, Jeff can see the future when he touches someone, hence the Brooding Loner life.

 By the way, when Babe was in the hospital, he and Way slept with the lights on so then I knew for sure I was watching a bl.

 Jeff has left the team after being falsely accused of tampering and for some reason even after working there for a while he needed to go through the complicated steps of putting Google directions to his home in his car.

 Charlie and Dean are going to race Babe for the chance to replace him in the race instead of just racing each other because of reasons.

 There’s so much machismo, I think it might melt my tv.

 Okay, here we go, vroom vroom!

 

Episode 6

 Whoops, I completely spaced out during the race. I should go back and watch it… Wait, I can’t tell which car is who, they’re all the same color. I’ll just look at who is happy at the end.

 Well, Babe seems to have done fine without his sense of smell, so I don’t know why he can’t do the big race.

 Darn, Way is smoking. ☹️ Oh good, Babe wants him to stop.

Oh yeah, Alan’s doing the classic song dedication! I always wished someone would do that for me when I was 12. It never happened. Bonus: Love Actually signs! Ooh, you know he’s serious when he’s switched to English.

 Ha! Jeff called him on using the radio dedication and Love Actually!!! 🤣🤣🤣 Ok that was actually adorable.

 Good thing no one else wants to drive on this road since you’re parked in the middle of it. Also I’m concerned about your car battery dying having the headlights on for an hour already.

 Dude! He just asked you be his boyfriend why are you bringing up children immediately? Ew, calling him Mama. Why not Papa and Dad? It’s kinda weird the show doesn’t ever explain the Omegaverse stuff. (No I’m not going to Google it. I don’t actually care).

 Oh, poor Way. I hope his jealousy doesn’t make him turn evil. (duhn, duhn, duhn!)

 Are you really sure you should flirt with your employees, Alan? That’s generally frowned upon.

 Huh, Mr. Toughguy sure is a mushy baby when in love. Obviously they’re just going to be happily ever after from now on. Because I’ve never seen TV before.

 HEY! BABE, YOU’RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SMOKING! That is for Bad Guys only!

 

Episode 7

 Good ol’ Lactasoy.

 Tony keeps reminding me of Don Johnson for some reason.

 Whoa! Okay I was not expecting Charlie to be working with Tony. So it’ll be the old “I was here at first to deceive you but then I fell in love with you!” thing. (Currently being put to good use in The Heart Killers. Of course, now that I’ve thought of that, I’m comparing their acting to Kant and Bison. … Sorry kids, FK4EVA). I really should’ve seen that coming, if I thought about it. But I’m not actually doing a lot of thinking here.

 After that anguish, how about some lovely toothbrushing with J Dent?

 Oh, Ok, ok, not exactly what I thought. But why not tell Babe from the beginning? \[PLOT REASONS\].

 Oh holy heck this evil plot of Tony’s. 😳😳

 Y’know Tony, you’re just going to drive Kenta to work against you. Haven’t you ever seen tv?

 Charlie, why were you okay with stealing Babe’s power? That’s… bad. Also, how do you know that the powers will return to the person you stole them from if you die? There’s no way you could’ve tested that…

 Why on earth is Babe not more mad about Charlie stealing his powers?

 By the way, there’s no way Babe and Charlie would know how to have normal human relationships after being raised mostly in isolation. Like things so basic as constantly talking about showering, how to order fancy coffees you’re not actually going to drink, how to fall on someone’s face and accidentally kiss, etc.

 *Am I making this hat too big? Well, it does need to go over dreads… Wait, this is off-topic. Louie, no one needs to hear your entire stream of consciousness.*

 I just, I just don’t think there’s enough room in the front seat of a convertible for that. (WILLING TO CONSIDER MORE TESTIMONY).

 Why was Kim the first one to think of getting evidence?

 Well, there you are. I really really can’t get over Babe not being upset about Charlie knowingly stealing his powers; we’ll see what happens!

After closing the lid on his mother’s coffin, Coffee, a fast-dealing 13-year-old, drifts from town to town with his father Jack, a card-sharp poker player. But before she died, she made her husband promise one thing, no more gambling. And he’s gonna keep that promise, but not before this one last score. 

As for Coffee, he dreams of being Dad’s full-fledged poker partner. But for now, he’s relegated to the kid’s table. Soon, his life gets shot downriver when he meets a sketchy girl named Tibia, and Dad gets wrapped up in a shadowy poker tournament.

When Dad gets kidnapped into the Afterlife, to play cards with the dead for the souls of the living, Coffee finds himself in a crazy new world. Tibia is really a skeleton girl, a grim reaper in training, and her friends are just as strange. 

To get Dad back, Coffee will have to compete in the tournament, run by the malevolent Suicide King. As things come to a boil, they find that all is not as it seems. The more souls the Suicide King wins, the stronger he gets. And if he can hit the jackpot, he’ll unearth an evil power, something strong enough that won’t just seal his reign over the land of the dead but the land of the living too.

It’ll all come down to the last hand, where Coffee will struggle to put to bed the ghosts of his past. Literally. In the end, he’ll have to decide what matters most, going home with Dad or staying true to his new family, the one he’s found on the other side.

Dead Hands is a YA Urban Fantasy complete at 106,000 words. It blends high-stakes poker with myths and legends of the US/Mexico border region. It’s a coming-of-age tale that has the crime fic fantasy feel of *Six of Crows* by Leigh Bardugo and the broken West atmosphere of *Wake of Vultures* by Lila Bowen.

I am 23 years old, I was diagnosed with Prostatitis at 18 years old with severe symptoms a urologist prescribed Tamsulosin 0.4mg pills (pill/per day) I went through all the side effects of the drug including irregular heartbeats, dizziness, and retro-ejaculation. I kept taking pill a day for 35 days after that I did a sonar scan that showed that my prostate was at normal size.

I stopped the dose immediately due to its side effects also heard from the doctor that side effects are reversible and will go away with time. ever since then, I thought I had constipation only tried all forms of colon drugs none of them worked. did an ultrasound scan on the pelvis again 1.5 years ago everything looked normal.

been living with constipation for 4 years and copping with cigarettes and Turkish coffee  I developed pain in my lower back again with the same feeling of poop inside my rectum alongside with headache mostly left area, chest pressure, and muscle twitches in my legs and arms.

however recently I decided to quit smoking for 1 week then symptoms got worse and I got swelling in the ilunin crest bone in my pelvis. thought it was a back problem or sciatica caused by disk herniation went to the brain, nervous system, and vertebral column doctor he asked for an MRI of the brain and vertebral then prescribed a muscle relaxant having {**Paracetamol 450 mg, Orphenadrine citrate 35 mg** 2 pills/day for week + **duloxetine 30 mg** 1 pill/day for week} none of them worked however I had penile discharge two times and I never had those for long time 2 years maybe. MRIs results after that week show everything is normal. he advised me to stop drugs and look for a general surgery doctor.

[https://pdf.ac/3qm1Y5](https://pdf.ac/3qm1Y5) <<< MRI Results

then I decided to go to a urologist, he asked me about my symptoms and then he checked my penis, and balls and they looked normal in size with no varicose veins. and he triggered the prostate took a sample from the prostatic fluid and put it under the microscope. then he told me that prostatic fluid looks super clean. told me that it's prostate inflammation Prescribed anti-inflammatory{ **Diclofenac 50mg** twice daily for a week }+ herbal treatment for a month herbs with doses are {

**Saw palmetto powder extract 150 mg**

**Tomato powder extract 41,67 mg**

**Uva Ursi powder extract 50 mg**

**Pygeum Africanum powder extract 385 mcg**

**Pumpkin seed oil 300 mg**

} + **I take multivitamins on my own.**

**while taking the medications for 5 days alongside taking fiber and eating healthy had another 2 times penile discharge. but I still have no consistent poop and twitches in my prostate and legs.**

took 15 ml of castor oil today and cleaned my colon I feel no chest pressure for now. ( for those who will ask poop color is normal however it's tight )

**WORTH MENTIONING** I started watching porn and masturbating 9 years ago ( started at 13 years old before maturing ) but I kept the rate normal and that means relative to my peers at school. I have been on NoFap for 3 weeks and had no wet dreams. I know a lot of resources on the internet say that pornography and masturbation don't have any side effects but I feel it's related to. Not feeling guilty about doing so. I just fear that nothing will come back to normal and I will live the rest of my life having these problems. also a bit mad about how rare to see a 23-year-old guy having such a thing.",1,1738437319.0,Prostatitis,2,1.0,False

1ifdtiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ifdtiy/seeking_help_moving_on_from_past_relationships_a/,Seeking help moving on from past relationships (a chatGPT therapy session) scroll to bottom for tldr,"So junior year, I met my ex girlfriend, let’s call her A. I was taking her best friend (let’s call her C) to prom whilst a good friend of mine (O) was taking A. The issue with this is that O had a giant crush on A. The day of prom we had a feast with a bunch of friends and couples who were all going. This occurred at the house A, my future girlfriend. All night at the dance, and even on the way to it. Me and A were having so much fun, O and C were sort of pushed aside for me and A. C was vouching for us to get together as she could see the obvious chemistry. However, O could see it too, and it didn’t sit right with him because he felt as if I was betraying him and taking “his girl” even though she didn’t want anything to do with him other than be his date to prom. The after party was at a classmates house, me and A agreed to stay sober together, and she and I were pretty much together for the whole party. I was also with C who was drinking and dancing a lot. And I was with the girl who I had a crush on since sophomore year first day, let’s call her M. A, M, and C were all in my arms on the couch as I watched pretty girls dance up on the coffee table. At this point my friend had become upset and belligerent and was causing damage to the homeowners property punching walls and lawn decor in the backyard. A left to talk with him. As all this is happening and for several months if not longer, I had a crush on another girl in the group. Let’s call her K. I don’t want to say she led me on, but she was definitely dragging me along. i had originally intended to ask her to prom but some punk did it first, and she had said yes to him. Even though I believe she knew I intended to ask her. Meanwhile as all of this is happening, there is a girl I’m messaging with who I can tell likes me and seems very insightful, let’s call her N, and I’m asking for her advice on these girls and what I should do. To this day, I don’t believe N was giving me bad advice. I think it came from a place of concern and wanting the best for me. N told me that she knew K, and knew about the type of person that she is. N told me K would drag me along until I’m not fun anymore. But she said that A and me seemed like a very good match. So in the coming weeks, I’m still talking with A, K, M, and N. Not so much O or C anymore. I started to take the advice from N to heart and noticed that when me and K hung out she wasn’t direct with me. Me and K would hang out often especially on the weekends. Even just the two of us alone at her house. But it didn’t feel so genuine, I remember one time it got a bit tense, as we were both close to eachothers faces, and I said something stupid like “do you like me” and she kept saying “you’re so stupid”. Looking back it was a yes, a genuine yes idk, but over these weeks I was also talking with A and things were amazing. So I basically settle down with A. Ask her to be my gf and all is well. A doesn’t get along with K or M for a long time and even had issues with another ex of mine. Named Chan. I’m curious if you think I played my cards well or if I just went with the easy option. Because I still think about K and M all the time and sometimes wish I hadn’t met A at all as she detracted from a lot of my highschool experiences by simply being a D1bound athlete with lots of eyes on her. I became known as her boyfriend instead of myself.

————————————————————

Hey, sorry about the wait! That’s a pretty complex situation, and I can see why it would stick with you. It seems like there were a lot of moving pieces at once—feelings for different people, advice from friends, and navigating the social dynamics of high school. From what you’ve shared, I think it’s clear that you were dealing with a lot of emotional pressure from your friends and the different girls in your life.

It sounds like you had real chemistry with A, and she might have been a good match for you in many ways. You seemed to be having fun and connecting with her, and it’s understandable that, given the circumstances, you would lean into that relationship. The fact that she supported you and was encouraging your bond with her probably gave you some reassurance, even as other people—like O—weren’t on board. But, on the other hand, it seems like your feelings for K and M didn’t really go away. They lingered because you weren’t fully satisfied with the attention you were getting from A, or maybe you didn’t feel as seen for yourself as you did with other people. 

As for whether you played your cards well or took the ""easy"" route, it's tough because high school relationships are often driven by a mix of emotions and social pressures. The ""easy"" choice might have been to stay with someone like A, especially if you felt a lot of external validation from being with her. But at the same time, it’s not like you weren’t trying to figure out your own feelings for other girls—like K and M—which shows you were paying attention to your own needs, even if things felt a bit complicated.

It seems like A, being a D1 athlete and having all that attention on her, played a role in how others saw you too. That can be tough, especially when it feels like your identity gets tied up in someone else’s. It might have been hard to feel like *you* were being seen for who you were outside of your relationship with her. So, I can see how you’d look back and wonder if you should’ve explored other experiences or relationships more freely. 

In the end, it doesn’t seem like you made a *wrong* choice, but maybe you made the one that seemed most secure or immediate, given the pressures you were under. As you look back, I think it’s normal to feel conflicted about ""what could have been,"" especially since those feelings for K and M didn’t just vanish. High school relationships are tricky like that, especially when you're trying to balance your own needs with the expectations of your friends, and the people around you. 

What do you think? Does any of that resonate with how you were feeling at the time?

———————

I would be lying to say I don’t think of all of them often. But K is what I think of in terms of “the one that got away” because I feel like our relationship was just starting and it really could’ve gone somewhere. She’s been dating the same person since highschool for close to a decade now.

——————

I totally get that. It sounds like K is the one that’s stayed in the back of your mind all this time, and when you look back, you wonder what could’ve happened if things had been different. That ""what if"" feeling is powerful, especially when you felt like you were just on the verge of something with her. The timing, the chemistry—it was all there, but then circumstances shifted, and you went down a different path. 

The fact that she’s been with the same person for so long now probably adds to that sense of ""the one that got away"" because it feels like that chapter is closed for good. It’s natural to wonder what could've been, especially if you feel like the connection with her was real and could’ve developed into something more meaningful. It’s easy to fantasize about those kinds of situations, especially when your relationship with A had its own pressures—like her being such a big figure in the social scene and maybe not being able to fully explore your own identity outside of that dynamic.

I think it’s also worth considering that sometimes relationships don’t happen for reasons that aren't immediately clear, and maybe K was just part of your journey that helped you grow, even if it didn’t lead to something long-term. But I get why you still think about it—those feelings don’t just disappear, and the ""what could’ve been"" always lingers.

Do you think about reaching out to K now? Or is it more just a lingering thought in the back of your mind, wondering what could’ve been?

—————

Of course I think about reaching out to her. I sometimes wish I’d run into her in dad to day life and that connection would rekindle. Like you said however, I’m afraid that door is closed, and I’m not comfortable enough with who I am currently to reach out and try to start something

——————

I can completely understand that feeling. It’s a mix of nostalgia for what could’ve been, but also that hesitation because of where you are in your life now. You imagine a moment where you run into her, and the timing just clicks, but at the same time, there's that sense that the door might have closed for good. Life moves on, people change, and sometimes reaching out feels like stepping into a moment that’s passed.

The part about not feeling comfortable enough with who you are right now really hits home. It’s tough when you feel like you've evolved or shifted in ways that might not line up with the person you were back then, especially when it comes to relationships or unresolved feelings. We grow and change, and sometimes the way we viewed things in high school doesn’t fully fit with who we are now. If you’re not feeling sure about yourself, it can make it hard to reach out, even if the impulse is there.

But at the same time, there's something about reconnection that can feel like an opportunity for closure, or at least some clarity on how things ended up. Maybe there's a way to do it in a way that feels right for you—no pressure, just a casual conversation to see where things stand. But it’s also totally okay if that’s not something you feel ready for. You don't need to rush into anything if you're not feeling like you're in a place where it makes sense.

Have you thought about how you'd feel if you did reach out and the connection wasn’t the same? Would that be something you'd be okay with, or is that part of why you're hesitant?

—————-

I’m assuming she’s still with that person, and she’s not going to be genuine with how we were because of their current relationship. I believe that if we were both single, that it would go well. Maybe not dating now well but well enough to at least like you said receive some closure. Maybe stop thinking about all this so I am comfortable to pursue other relationships

———————-

It makes a lot of sense why you feel hesitant, then. You’re right that the context of her being in a long-term relationship now changes things. Even if she were open to rekindling a connection, it’s hard to imagine her being as genuine about the past if she’s committed to someone else. It’s natural to want that closure, though—some kind of resolution or understanding to finally move past the “what could’ve been” and free up space to pursue other things.

I think you’re also spot-on in acknowledging that, if both of you were single, there could be a more straightforward path to exploring that connection without the weight of existing relationships hanging over you. But right now, it sounds like you're caught in this kind of limbo—wanting closure, but not wanting to risk disrupting her current life or getting involved in something complicated that could potentially feel less genuine. 

Sometimes, closure doesn't have to come from a direct conversation—it can come from accepting that the moment has passed and that your life has moved on in other ways. The tricky part is finding a way to let go of those lingering thoughts, which is often easier said than done. You may never get the full ""closure"" you want, but it could be possible to shift your focus to the present and future, especially if you're in a place where you feel ready to be open to new relationships and experiences.

It sounds like you’re still carrying a lot of that emotional weight, and it’s understandable why that might make you reluctant to fully move on. Have you noticed if there’s a specific thing that helps you start to feel more at peace with it, or does it mostly just feel like something that lingers in the background?

————-

It definitely feels like a background lingering phantom. Something I’ve never been able to fully address because whenever I think about it, I get nostalgic and down on myself.

—————

I get that. When something lingers like that, it can be hard to shake off, especially because nostalgia has a way of pulling you back to a time when things felt simpler or more exciting. It’s like you’re remembering the potential of what could have been, rather than how things actually turned out. That kind of reflection can leave you feeling a little stuck, because it’s not just about the person or the situation—it’s tied to how you felt at the time, and what you wanted out of those relationships. And when that feeling is tied to self-doubt, it makes it harder to move forward.

The fact that it’s a ""phantom"" lingering in the background probably means you haven’t fully processed what it meant for you—like there’s still some emotional residue that hasn’t been addressed. It’s also totally normal to feel down on yourself in those moments. It's like, when you think about what *could’ve* been, it can feel like you missed out on something, or didn’t handle it the ""right"" way at the time. But the reality is, you made choices with the information and emotions you had at the time, and there’s no real “right” or “wrong” in those moments—it’s just all part of learning who you are and what you want.

Do you think the lingering feelings are tied more to the missed potential with K, or is it also about how things turned out with A? Or maybe it's both—like you’re not just thinking about the one that got away, but also the way your identity got tied up with that relationship, which didn’t leave much room for other parts of you to develop?

I wonder if, at some point, confronting that lingering phantom and addressing it head-on could helphh you release some of that emotional weight. Maybe not with a big, grand gesture like reaching out to K, but in smaller ways—maybe acknowledging how those feelings shaped your high school experience and understanding how they've affected the way you see your current self. Does that sound like something that could help ease that background noise?

Thanks for sharing the full transcription. I see why this is weighing on you—it’s clear there were a lot of deep emotions at play and so many complicated dynamics with A, K, and others. You’ve been navigating this “what could’ve been” feeling for a while, and I can understand why it feels like a ghost, always present in the background of your mind. 

It seems like the core of this is not just about K, but also about how your high school experience got shaped by your relationship with A. The way your identity became tied to her—being her boyfriend rather than being seen for who you were as an individual—seems like it left a lasting impact. That’s tough, because you weren’t just trying to figure out what you wanted with A, but also trying to explore who *you* were amidst all these social pressures.

I’m also sensing that the lingering feelings about K come from that sense of “missed potential” more than any one thing about her. When you think about K, it’s less about the person she is now or the relationship she’s been in for years, and more about the version of you back then who was full of possibility, wondering what might have happened if circumstances had been different.

You mentioned earlier that reaching out to K doesn’t feel right given where she is in her life now. It’s understandable—you don’t want to open that door and potentially disrupt her current life, or worse, feel like you’re trying to relive something that doesn’t exist anymore. At the same time, I think acknowledging these lingering feelings doesn’t have to mean reaching out to her. It could be more about accepting that chapter as part of your growth, and maybe even allowing yourself to be okay with the idea that some things just stay in the past.

You also asked if your choice of being with A was the ""easy"" option, and in hindsight, it seems like a part of you still wishes you’d explored other relationships. But I think you’ve grown since then and now, you’re trying to balance that nostalgic pull with the need for self-acceptance. It sounds like you’re in a phase where you want to finally break free of that ""phantom"" feeling, and part of that might be finding ways to process it, rather than let it define you or your future choices.

Does that resonate? Would focusing on your growth from those experiences, and acknowledging what you’ve learned about yourself, help you feel more at peace with it all? Or is there still a part of you that wants closure in some way?

—————-

A part of me wants nothing more than to see K again and develop some kind of romantic relationship. Moreso than other people of my past who I believe would be even better for me.

—————-

I get that. It sounds like there's something about K that still feels like *the one that got away*—the ""what if"" that keeps lingering. Even though you recognize that other people might be more compatible or better for you in the long run, it seems like there's a deeper emotional pull with her. Maybe it's the history you share, or the feeling that something unfinished or unspoken still exists between you two. 

I think that longing to reconnect with someone, especially someone from your past, can be really powerful. It’s often less about who they are now and more about what they represented at a certain point in your life—what they meant to you at that time and what could have been if things had gone differently. It's not unusual to feel drawn to that, especially when you’ve built up the idea of what could happen in your mind.

That said, there’s a lot to consider if you were to reach out. The reality now is that both of you have changed, and so have your circumstances. You could reconnect, but it might not play out how you hope, especially if she’s with someone else, or if the connection isn't what it was in your mind. It’s tough because even though you *want* to see where it could go, there's that fear it might be underwhelming or leave you feeling stuck in the past.

Have you thought about what exactly you’d want from that reconnection with K, beyond just the idea of a relationship? Is it closure? A chance to see how things might have developed? Or is it more about the nostalgia of those moments you shared when things were more open-ended?

—————

Well what do you think based on this conversation?

——————-

Based on our conversation, I’d assume that what you’re really seeking from reconnecting with K isn’t just about rekindling a relationship for the sake of romance. It seems more like you’re looking for some kind of closure or resolution—to understand what that connection between you two really was, and whether it could have turned into something deeper. You’ve mentioned how you still think about her and how things felt like they were just starting to develop, so I get the sense that it’s that *missed potential* that keeps you holding on to the idea of her.

You also seem to be grappling with the fact that even if she were to come into your life again, it wouldn’t be the same as it was back then—life, people, and relationships evolve. But you’re still curious to see how it could play out, especially because there’s something about K that stands out to you more than other people in your past. Maybe it’s the ""what could’ve been"" that’s so powerful, but it also seems like you’re trying to reconcile that with the fact that other connections could be just as good, if not better, for you.

Ultimately, it feels like you’re looking for some sense of clarity. You want to know if that lingering feeling towards K is something real or just a product of nostalgia, and whether letting go of it could finally give you peace so you can focus on moving forward, whether it’s with someone else or just with yourself.

How close do I get with that guess?

——————

I’d say pretty damn close, there’s a part of me that wishes she thinks the same way about me. 

——————-

That makes a lot of sense. If you’re still carrying that feeling that K might think of you in the same way—that maybe she has the same “what could’ve been” in her mind—it adds a whole other layer to it. It’s like there’s a part of you still holding on to the possibility that she’s out there thinking about you, wondering how things might’ve gone differently. That hope, however small, can keep the connection alive in your mind, even if it feels like you’ve moved on in other ways.

It’s tough because, even if it’s not entirely clear how she feels now, that desire to be on the same page with someone from your past can make it harder to let go. It’s like, if you knew she felt the same way, maybe it would give you the closure you need or even reignite that spark. But, as you said earlier, you’re not sure if you’re ready to reach out or even if it would be the right move, given her current relationship and everything that’s changed.

If she does think of you in the same light, I imagine it would be incredibly validating—to know that the feelings you had weren’t one-sided and that, somewhere along the way, she may have shared that “what could’ve been” sentiment too.

I’m curious—do you think it’s the idea of *her* you’re holding on to, or more the idea of a relationship with someone who could've understood you in a way that felt different from the other relationships you’ve had?

—————-

I do think our relationship would have been different form the one I ended up being in at the time. In the sense that I would’ve had more freedom to be myself and to goof off and have fun.

—————-

That’s a really insightful way to put it. It sounds like with K, you felt like you could be *yourself* more—maybe there was more room for spontaneity, fun, and not being defined by a certain relationship dynamic or identity. It makes sense why that freedom would feel so appealing, especially when compared to what you had with A, where it seems like there was a lot of external pressure and expectations—being seen as *her* boyfriend rather than being able to fully explore who *you* were.

With K, there was potential for a more carefree, less constrained relationship, where you could just enjoy each other’s company without all the weight of social dynamics or being part of a ""package deal."" That freedom to just ""goof off"" and have fun is something a lot of people crave, especially in high school when everything feels so intense and charged with expectations.

I can see why that feeling of what *could have been*—a relationship that gave you space to just be yourself—is something you still hold on to. It wasn’t just about romantic chemistry, but about the way you felt in her presence, the way it allowed you to feel more relaxed and authentic. 

Do you think that kind of dynamic is something you’ve found in any relationships since? Or does the memory of what you could’ve had with K still stand apart as something you wish you could experience?

—————

feel like I’ve gotten close in some relationships, I’ll never know what it would’ve been like with K, though. I am still trying to figure out what makes me, me. I think that with K and her creativity, and spontaneity, and overall just general appreciation for the little things, that it would’ve been a much healthier relationship for me. Even though N warned me that she was just leading me on.

————-

It sounds like you really saw something in K that made you feel like you could thrive and grow in a relationship—like there was space for your true self to emerge. Her creativity, spontaneity, and ability to appreciate the small moments all seem like qualities that resonated with you and made you feel like *that* was the kind of connection you needed, something that could've been both fulfilling and freeing.

It’s interesting that N warned you K might’ve been leading you on, though. That adds another layer of complexity—because, despite those warnings, you still felt drawn to her energy and what you imagined you could have together. It sounds like, even with some uncertainty about K’s intentions, you felt like that type of relationship could’ve been the one where you didn’t feel as weighed down by expectations or needing to fit into a mold. You might’ve felt seen and appreciated in a different way than you did in your relationship with A.

You’re right—there’s no way to know what it would’ve been like with K. That’s part of why it still lingers, isn’t it? The ""what if"" can be powerful, especially when it feels like it could’ve been a healthier, more authentic relationship for you. But I think it’s also important that you’re acknowledging where you’re at in terms of *yourself*—figuring out who you really are and what makes you feel whole. It sounds like you're still exploring that, and that can be a crucial part of moving forward.

I wonder if, in a way, these past relationships with K and A are part of your own journey to understand what you need from a partner. Maybe the healthy relationship you’re envisioning isn’t just about the person, but about *how* you interact with them and how they make you feel seen, free, and able to be yourself. Does that seem true to you? Do you feel like you're starting to figure that out now, or is it still something you're working through?

——————

Yes absolutely, I fully believe these relationships and others of my past have set me up for success in future relationships. But golly it sure is difficult to let go of something like that.

————-

I totally get that. Even though you can see how these past relationships have shaped you and are helping you figure out what you need in the future, letting go of something that felt so meaningful—or the potential of it—can be incredibly tough. The ""what ifs"" can stick with you, especially when you feel like you were so close to something that could have been exactly what you needed at the time.

It sounds like you’ve grown a lot from those experiences, even if it’s still hard to fully let go of the feelings tied to them. And the fact that you're reflecting on how these past relationships set you up for success in future ones shows a lot of maturity. But still, it’s normal for those old connections to come back to the surface—especially when they represent a time when you felt like you could be your most authentic self.

It’s almost like you’re not just letting go of the relationship with K, but also the idea of who you were and what you wanted at that time. That’s a lot to process, especially since it involves a version of yourself that you were still figuring out. And I think that’s what makes it feel so difficult to release—it’s tied to who you *could’ve* been or the version of yourself that was still unfolding.

It’s okay to feel conflicted about it. The good news is, you're learning from it and moving forward, and that awareness will help you in future relationships. But yeah, it’s definitely not a quick or easy thing to fully let go of. It’s more of a gradual process, where you make peace with it over time. 

Have you found any ways that help you ease those lingering feelings when they pop up? Or does it mostly just take time for you to process it all?

———-

See that part is difficult, because on my current life, situations will arise that remind me of K and A and how things were, and I’m not fully able to take these situations for what they are currently. I feel the need to reflect them against my past. 

—————-

That’s a really insightful way to put it. It sounds like your past relationships—especially with K and A—are still so tied up with how you view certain situations in your current life. When those moments or feelings arise, you end up measuring them against what you experienced before, which can make it difficult to fully engage with what’s happening right now. It’s like your mind can’t help but compare the present to the past, wondering if it’s *measuring up* or if it feels similar to what you’ve already been through. 

It’s natural to reflect on your past experiences, but it seems like right now, that reflection might be clouding your ability to take situations for what they are—without feeling the need to constantly make comparisons. That’s a big challenge because, on some level, you’re still processing those past relationships, and they’re influencing how you see things in the present. And, of course, that can lead to some emotional heaviness because you're not able to fully *be* in the moment without those memories or expectations creeping in.

I wonder if part of the difficulty is that you haven’t fully been able to separate the old narratives you have about your relationships with K and A from the new experiences you're having. Maybe the feelings, the way you see yourself, and how you connect with others are all still interwoven with those past dynamics. It might not be that you haven’t moved on, but rather that you're still figuring out how to process and understand those past relationships in a way that allows you to truly experience what's happening now, without constantly measuring it against those old feelings.

What do you think would help shift your focus more to the present, instead of comparing it to what was? Have you thought about any small things you could do to start letting go of that habit of reflection—maybe in those moments where you find yourself stuck in comparison?

—————

Idk do you have tips and insight?

——————

I’m glad you’re open to exploring ways to shift your focus more to the present. It’s definitely not an easy thing to do, especially when your past relationships have such a strong emotional pull. But there are a few strategies you can try to help you create some space between your past experiences and what’s happening now:

### 1. **Mindfulness & Grounding Techniques**
   - **Practice being in the moment**: One of the most effective ways to detach from past comparisons is to ground yourself in the present moment. You can use mindfulness techniques to focus on your senses—what you see, hear, smell, and feel right now. This helps break the cycle of overthinking and gives you a chance to experience the current situation for what it is, not what it reminds you of.
   - **The ""5-4-3-2-1"" exercise**: This is a simple grounding technique. Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This quick mental check-in helps you pull your focus from your thoughts about the past and anchor you in the present moment.

### 2. **Shift Your Narrative**
   - **Reframe your thoughts**: When you catch yourself comparing your current situation to your past (e.g., “This doesn’t feel as fun as when I was with K”), try to reframe it. Instead of thinking about how something compares, try to view it as its own unique experience. Ask yourself, “What makes this situation special or valuable in its own right?”
   - **Acknowledge the past without living in it**: It’s okay to acknowledge that your past relationships influenced who you are now, but remind yourself that your present experiences are separate from those. You can say to yourself, “That was a chapter in my life, but this is *my* chapter now, and it’s unfolding in its own way.” It’s about accepting the past, but not letting it dictate your present.

### 3. **Journaling**
   - **Track your current feelings**: Sometimes, when you’re caught up in past comparisons, writing about how you’re feeling can help you separate out what’s old from what’s new. Try journaling about the current situation—what’s different, how it feels now, what you’re learning from it. Reflecting this way allows you to understand your emotions and see where your past might still be influencing them, so you can consciously choose to shift your focus.
   - **Use prompts to reframe**: If you notice yourself getting caught in comparisons, ask yourself questions like:
     - “How does this situation make me feel in *this moment*?”
     - “What’s unique about this experience that has nothing to do with the past?”
     - “What would it look like if I let go of my expectations and just allowed this situation to unfold as it is?”

### 4. **Give Yourself Permission to Let Go**
   - **Set boundaries with your thoughts**: When your mind starts to drift into comparisons, gently remind yourself that it’s okay to let go of that. It might sound simple, but saying to yourself, “I don’t need to compare this moment to the past” can help you reorient. Think of it as setting an emotional boundary with yourself—one that allows you to stop carrying the weight of what came before and focus on what’s in front of you.
   - **Practice self-compassion**: It’s normal to think about the past, especially when there are unresolved feelings or deep connections. Be kind to yourself for still feeling attached to these memories. Acknowledge that it’s okay to grieve the “what could have been,” but remind yourself that the present is still valuable and worth engaging with.

### 5. **Create New Patterns**
   - **Be intentional with new experiences**: When you’re trying to build a new chapter for yourself, it can help to consciously create experiences that are different from the past. Whether that’s trying new activities, meeting new people, or even adopting new habits, these new experiences can help you define your current self outside of the shadows of previous relationships.
   - **Reintroduce spontaneity**: Since you mentioned that with K you felt a sense of freedom and fun, try to reintroduce that into your life now—whether it’s being more spontaneous in the way you spend your time, exploring new hobbies, or just doing something outside of your usual routine. By giving yourself permission to have fun and be playful in the present, you’ll start to create new, positive associations that are less about comparison and more about enjoying *this moment*.

### 6. **Talk About It with Someone You Trust**
   - **Get perspective from others**: Sometimes, talking things through with a close friend or therapist can help you see patterns in how you’re thinking. They can remind you of how far you’ve come and offer a fresh perspective on your current situation. It’s always helpful to get an outside viewpoint to help you detach from old stories and create a healthier mindset about where you’re at now.

### 7. **Embrace the Uncertainty**
   - **Accept that the “what could’ve been” won’t always make sense**: One of the hardest parts of moving on is accepting that you’ll never have all the answers. The future with K, or any other past relationship, is a road you didn’t take, and it can be tempting to keep looking back, wondering if you made the right choice. But sometimes, embracing the unknown and accepting that you’re on a new path can help ease the emotional tension. Letting go of the need for complete closure or certainty can actually be freeing.

---

These are just a few ways to start working through the challenge of comparison. The main goal is to slowly shift your mindset so you can be present in your current life and allow yourself to experience new connections without the baggage of the past weighing you down. It’s a process, and there will likely be moments where your mind drifts back, but with practice, you can create more space to fully live in the moment and enjoy what’s in front of you.

What do you think? Do any of these strategies feel like something you could try? Or are there any that resonate more with how you're feeling?


TLDR: a blend of complicated situations in my past especially during a time of tumultuous decision-making has led me to keep thinking about what could’ve been and I’m not able to move on and get closure.

1ifdryo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ifdryo/aita_for_not_driving_my_friend_to_the_airport/,AITA for not driving my friend to the airport?,"I (31f) recently drifted away from a friend (25f). I thought this happened naturally, (not hanging out as much / not talking over instagram etc.) but she felt hurt by the distance. We “broke up” over text after the she sent l an incredibly long “what did I do?” to which I responded in summary “nothing really, I feel like we’re just in different parts of life. I wish you the best though!”

I realize now this text was the opportunity she wanted to launch into a diatribe of all the things I did wrong in the relationship and that she felt offended by. I had NO idea. One of these things was a miscommunication about driving to the airport. (A year and a half ago!)

She messaged me in August 2023 about driving her to the airport at 6 in September. I said sure, even though this is something that I would not normally ask of a friend (I would ask my mom for or get an uber. Gas is expensive!) but I thought “well, she doesn’t have a lot of family here” so I said sure, you can get me a coffee and we’ll call it even. I’m a morning person so I figured she was asking me to drive her at 6 am. If I had known she meant 6pm I would have not agreed in the first place. 

So flight day arrives and I roll up to her place at 6. I call her. Dial tone. Finally I get a hold of her and she says that the flight was at 6pm. We both apologized for the misunderstanding. I go back home to bed. I get up for work and am feeling (understandably?) tired and a bit grumpy. I send her a text saying “hey, I’m not upset at you, but I am a bit grumpy about this miscommunication and am going to have to politely decline to drive you at 6pm tonight to rest” I gave her notice and she replied “totally fair, I’m so sorry for the mix up!” and she sent me a starbucks giftcard for my trouble, which was a sweet but totally unnecessary gesture. She got to the airport, I wished her a nice vacation, and we caught up when she got back. I thought all was well. 

Folks, all was not well. She had apparently held on to this resentment as “I broke a promise” to her. She said me cancelling was selfish cause she couldn’t afford an uber and was shocked that I didn’t rearrange my schedule to drive her at 6pm. She apparently had to take a bus and then get another friend to drive her “who dropped everything for her”. She was flabbergasted that she “sent me the giftcard and then I cancelled! WHO DOES THAT?!” Apparently I didn’t prioritize her and didn’t care about her feelings and wellbeing as I knew how much this trip meant to her.

I looked back and she sent me the giftcard after I declined to drive her. I thought it was a nice gesture at the time, but now I feel like she felt like I owed it to her to say “aww, since you got me coffee I WILL drive you now”. I thought this was a simple favour that I could revoke cause circumstances changed and not “a promise”. I am doubly confused cause she said over text that it was fine at the time.

1ifdqx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/strange/comments/1ifdqx8/so_it_my_house_just_haunted_now/,"So, it my house just haunted now?","I live in a fairly small ranch house. The kitchen and living room are right next to each other, and about where they meet, a hallway goes off to the bedrooms.  The ""passageway"" between the living room and kitchen is about as wide as a standard door (about three feet wide), it's not ""open concept"".  I live here with my wife and two adult ""kids"". 

Last night about midnight, my wife already in bed, I was sitting on my couch with headphones on watching YouTube videos on my tablet.  I thought I hear someone milling about in the kitchen, and it would not be unusual at all for one of the kids to go in there and get something at that time. I looked down the hall, and saw all the doors closed, which they always leave open if they go to the kitchen.   The noise persisted for like 20 seconds, and I got curious, stood up, took off my headphones and went into the kitchen.  The noise just stopped.  I stood there a good 15 seconds, and no noise.  The dog had been with me on the couch, the cat was in the bedroom with my wife. 

I go back to what I am doing, and shortly go to bed. 

This morning about 6 AM, I hear a howl which I assumed was a coyote. That is common behind our house.  But, this sounded different than all the coyotes I've heard in the two decades we've lived here.  Coyotes either have the classic howl, or they are very ""yippy yappy"".  This was a very even howl that started, remained constant, and ended five seconds later.  The dog started to growl a little.  This happened about five times. My wife even mentioned the strangeness of the howl, and I said ""I know, at first I thought it was a woman.""

This morning, I sit down on the couch to drink my coffee and do Wordle.  No one else is up yet.  I start to hear this very regular ticking sound.  It sounds like it's every second, and we have two clocks in the kitchen that tick, but not nearly that loud.  I listen for ten seconds, and get up and as I enter the kitchen, the sound stops.  This seems a little odd.

Not five minutes later, I hear a gust of wind hit the house.  This is not uncommon, but what struck me was that it had been dead calm up until now.  Out the front window there is a little patio thing where we have a loveseat glider, which is currently covered, and the wind often swirls around in this spot.  So, I see this gust of wind swirling and causing the cover of the glider to basically inflate like a huge balloon.  I've seen it get blown around a little, but not like this.  After ten seconds.  It is dead calm again.  

About 8 AM, my wife is in the kitchen, and says ""There's a coyote back there just past the fence.""  Sure enough, there's a coyote.  Smallest one I've ever seen.  I don't think it's the right time for pups.  I go to let the dog out; she goes crazy over coyotes and I thought she would love to bark at this one.  She sticks her head out, and backs up into the house.  The coyote looks at us and slowly walks off. 

Hours later, this being a short while ago, I made some lunch and sat down at the kitchen table to eat it.  As I sit there, I hear it get really windy again.  After about ten seconds of it being windy, I hear what sounds like some kind of metal panel falling on concrete.  And a few more seconds, the wind stops.  The ""metal"" sound was concerning, because I have no idea what it could be.  So, I go out the back door (right next to the table) and walk all around the yard. We have a large concrete patio, but there's nothing on it that would have made such a sound.  I see nothing out of place anywhere in the yard.  I even look up and scan the roof.  Nothing.  I then walk all the way around the house, I see nothing out of the ordinary.  I even look over the fence into my neighbor's yard, but can't really see if there was an out-of-place metal panel.

1ifdomz,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1ifdomz/i_cant_take_it_anymore/,I can’t take it anymore,"I’m just here to vent. Not looking for any advice. I know there are good husbands out there who care for their family but I’m not sure if my husband is one. I have so much resentment and anger towards him. 

I have a 3months old and a 5year old who is very active and requires a lot of attention. I have been taking care of my 3months old 24/7 and I’m feeling constantly tired all the time. Even when I’m sick and tired, the breastfeeding continues. My mom is here to help but she is leaving in a month’s time. Because she is an elderly, she also has her needs to be met, her back is aching and she doesn’t sleep well at night. So while there is help, it is still limited and after all she is my mom, I still need to also ensure her well being.

This morning I woke up and I have a very bad backache, I told my husband, and he said just like your mom’s backache, she carries baby less so maybe you just have to carry the baby less often. I am so dumbfounded by his response. I seriously don’t understand why would someone respond like that to a mom. If I don’t carry the baby, who else can carry? He works during the weekday and helps to do school dropoff and pickup and weekends he helps to chauffeur the 5year old to classes and have some break time. But my work continues 24/7 without any rest. Why can’t someone be more empathetic? 

During the weekends, I get frustrated as well. I understand his work is busy during the weekday and might need to have a break but to be honest, who gets a break when having a baby. I suggested getting a sitter to help at home with the 5yo and he said there’s too many people at home so we didn’t go with that idea. I wanted to let him know that with a sitter, at least we have some flexibility and options to rest, go get coffee, or he can help with baby. But all he says is he can bring our 5yo out. And I told him it’s not about bringing 5yo out, it’s me having a break if he can take care of the baby. He said I can bring the 5yo out then. But I’m an introvert, I’m breastfeeding, I am tired and it will be even more tiring for me to go out and he knew. I am just very tired of talking to him. After that, he says he wants to go out and have coffee with his friend in the afternoon but it’s going to rain and I said it’s not very convenient for the 5yo to go out especially he has flu and he said why don’t I go alone. I seriously don’t understand why is his brains so silly that if he goes alone, that means I have to take care of two kids by myself.

In addition, he is not very on top of things, I have to remind him of his things. I do all the laundry, clothing for both kids and even asking him to check our 5yo school work, he just left the paper there on the table. All he thinks about is going out. And I take care of the things at home. This mental load is just huge for the family and I just cannot take it anymore.

1ifdnk8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ifdnk8,Dry Erase + Elevation Setup for Argynvolstholt,"I couldn't find a good example of how to run Argynvolstholt with a dry erase setup. The elevation in the main room in particular makes for interesting combat with the spiders. Additionally the dry erase board has limited space so the map needed to be rejigged a bit to fit everything.

I couldn't find t-stairs so I made some in blender (a very amateur version), I added little holes behind the steps so 3mm baseplates can slide in (I need to redo this a bit for the first few steps) and I added textures which was fun 😊 

Then for elevation I had either the best idea or worst idea. I printed a bunch of 60mm towers and with sticky tack, cardboard and laminated grid paper (most dry erase boards!!!) I had a semblance of elevation. I tried to model the towers in blender based off another design but my results weren't as good as the existing one on thingiverse - I super glued the towers together but normally they can fold flat which might be nice. The grid paper I also made and trimmed a bit (everytime I get to use the laminator I feel great).

The prop photos for the second floor have the T-trap hallway in the wrong position but it's right in the blank version.

For the first floor I missed adding my Savid mini but he's there.

For the second floor I chopped the head off one of the PCs backup minis (accidentally picked a resin backup instead of FDM) and put that on a pedestal.

Third floor definitely has a lot of trimmed content and the roof with have to borrow panels from other areas or be theory of mind.

Afterwards was just adjusting layouts and decorating the rooms. I removed the meeting room and compressing other rooms in favor of space to support the chapel. Our table will probably be suuuuper cramped and this biases the players away from checking the spider's ballroom etc... but overall I'm happy with the results.

In this case the party has Esmerelda with a stolen horse, Vistani are in pursuit and can be a ""man with a gun"" in the event they want a long rest or thing start to get slow (or they go too fast). Ireena is also with them. She's more decorative than anything but is super depressed having lost almost all hope... I keep throwing out a ""she seems upset"" but no one seems to be biting on that. We'll try to dial that up.

In any ""oh shit"" moment I have Godfrey who can jump in to save the day then he will bring the party upstairs to meet the gang.

Other prep I have is a printed out tome of strahd and journal of Argynvolstholt on bought weathered paper (I did the coffee weathered versions for the death house and while this doesn't feel as nice it's so much easier).

I was tempted to print out Argynvolstholt but I did the Durst House a while ago and ran that. It was a LOT of work and the printed structures are cool but also kind of a bummer with spacing... This tower + sticky tack method definitely has its flaws too but I like the visibility and the pseudo awe factor while still being plain enough that it leaves room for imagination (although it might look too janky and ruin part of the vibe).

My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how much coffee I drank, it felt like my brain was running on fumes. I couldn’t focus, couldn’t think clearly, and the fatigue wasn’t just physical—it was mental, emotional, and relentless.

[**visit the official website for Purchase**](https://tinyurl.com/39jy5bmj)

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

[**visit the official website for Purchas**](https://tinyurl.com/39jy5bmj)

Then came the physical changes.

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

Now, I’m not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it’s hard not to share it. I went from being skeptical to becoming a believer, not because of flashy marketing or exaggerated claims, but because of results I could see and feel every single day.",1,1738436528.0,OKRABLEACH,0,1.0,False

# A Hell of a Heist

Helltaker was used to chaos—his apartment had been in a state of constant disorder since he dragged a bunch of demons into the mortal world. But nothing could have prepared him for the scene before him.

Pandemonica was pacing angrily, her usual tired demeanor shattered. Azazel, the curious angel, was nervously flipping through a notebook, muttering something about ""divine repercussions."" Malina was furiously typing on her keyboard while Justice leaned against the wall, grinning like she had just heard the funniest joke in existence.

Lucifer, meanwhile, had her arms crossed, her tail flicking impatiently.

Helltaker sighed. “What’s going on? What did you do this time?”.

Lucifer chuckled. “It’s not *what* I did, darling. It’s what we’re *going* to do.”

Everyone groaned.

“Oh, come on,” Lucifer pouted. “It’s just a little heist! Azazel mentioned there’s a vault in Heaven filled with divine relics, and I simply *must* have my old trident back.”

Azazel flinched. “I *never* said we should steal from Heaven! I just—”

Lucifer ignored her, turning dramatically. “Besides, don’t you all miss a little *excitement*? A little *mayhem*? Helltaker, darling, back me up here.”

Helltaker stared blankly.

Justice laughed. “C’mon, big guy, it could be fun! It’s not every day you break into Heaven.”

Zdrada flicked her cigarette. “Lame. But if we’re actually robbing angels, I’m in.”

Modeus clasped her hands. “Will there be a dramatic lovers' reunion scene?”

“No,” Malina grumbled, still typing furiously. “We’ll all get obliterated before we even get past the gates.”

Lucifer smirked. “Not if we do it *right.*”

Helltaker groaned.

# A Hell of a Heist – Part 2

Helltaker had faced a lot of absurd situations in his life. Bargaining with demons? Done that. Bringing them into the mortal world? Easy. Keeping them from destroying his apartment on a daily basis? A nightmare, but manageable.

But planning a **heist in Heaven**? That was a whole new level of insanity.

Lucifer had gathered the group in their cramped living room, which now resembled a makeshift war room. A crudely drawn map of Heaven was pinned to the wall (sketched by Azazel, who *insisted* she had no part in this). Sticky notes labeled *""Angel patrol routes""*, *""Security wards""*, and *""How to not get smited""* were scattered across the coffee table.

Malina leaned against the couch with her arms crossed. “Alright, genius, how exactly do you expect us to even get *into* Heaven? Pretty sure they don’t just let demons waltz in.”

Lucifer smirked. “Oh, but they do! *Sort of.*” She turned to Azazel. “Tell them about the thing.”

Azazel flinched. “I-I still don’t think this is a good idea, but… um… there *is* an annual Heavenly Gala where even mortals and redeemed souls are allowed to visit.”

Lucifer clapped her hands. “Perfect! We’ll disguise ourselves as honored guests, sneak into the vault, and retrieve my trident before anyone notices.”

Helltaker sighed. “Why do I feel like we’ll be noticed *immediately*?”

Justice grinned, leaning back on the couch. “Because we absolutely will be. And it’ll be hilarious.”

Lucifer waved dismissively. “Details, details! Now, let’s assign roles. Every great heist has specialists, after all.”

She pulled out a piece of paper and started writing:

* **The Mastermind:** Herself, of course.
* **The Muscle:** Helltaker. (He groaned but didn’t argue.)
* **The Hacker:** Malina. (""This is so stupid,"" she muttered, but continued typing.)
* **The Infiltrator:** Zdrada. (“Cool. I call dibs on punching an angel.”)
* **The Distraction:** Modeus. (“Wait, what?”)
* **The Inside Woman:** Azazel. (“Wha—No! I’m not helping!!”)
* **The Getaway Driver:** Justice. (“Do I get to drive an angel chariot? Please say yes.”)
* **The Backup:** Pandemonica. (Who simply adjusted her glasses and sipped her coffee, saying nothing.)

Modeus looked genuinely confused. “Why am *I* the distraction?”

Lucifer smiled. “Sweetheart, you’re the demon of lust. Just… **exist**, and every angel in a ten-mile radius will be too flustered to focus.”

Modeus gasped. “Are we doing the *seductive spy* act?! Oh my Hell, I *love* those stories!”

Malina groaned. “I’m in actual hell.”

Helltaker just crossed his arms. “I assume I don’t get a choice in this?”

Lucifer patted his shoulder. “Darling, you never had a choice the moment you went to Hell for demon waifus.”

He sighed. She had a point.

# A Hell of a Heist – Part 3

The night of the Heavenly Gala arrived faster than Helltaker would have liked.

Despite all the planning (which consisted mostly of Lucifer making things up on the spot and everyone else complaining), the group now stood before the Pearly Gates. The towering entrance shimmered with divine light, guarded by a pair of stoic archangels in pristine golden armor.

Helltaker adjusted the uncomfortable white suit Lucifer had forced him into. “This is a terrible idea.”

“This is a *brilliant* idea,” Lucifer corrected, adjusting her extravagant fur-lined cape. “And you *look amazing,* darling.”

The others were similarly dressed. Malina had ditched her usual wear for a sleek black 3 peice suit, arms crossed and already regretting everything. Justice, ever confident, strolled beside her in an all-white tuxedo, grinning as if they weren’t seconds away from a celestial disaster.

Modeus, wearing a dress *far* too elegant for a heist, was practically bouncing in place. “This is so exciting! Do you think there will be *drama*? A forbidden romance?!”

Zdrada, somehow managing to look both classy and completely uninterested, exhaled a puff of smoke. “If by drama you mean a massive fight, then yeah. Definitely.”

Azazel, meanwhile, was an absolute wreck.

“I can’t believe I’m doing this,” the angel muttered, clutching a clipboard as she led the group forward. “If we get caught, I’ll be exiled, I’ll lose my research privileges, and—”

“Relax,” Lucifer said, patting Azazel’s head. “That’s only *if* we get caught.”

Azazel whimpered.

**Step One: Get Inside.**

As they reached the gates, the angel guards blocked their path. One of them narrowed her eyes at Helltaker.

“Name and purpose?”

Azazel stepped forward, her voice shaking. “Um, honored guests for the Heavenly Gala! I, uh, submitted their names earlier… under the *Academic Observers of the Mortal-Demonic Relations Initiative.*”

The guards looked at each other.

“…That’s not a real thing,” one said.

Azazel paled.

Lucifer, without missing a beat, clutched her chest dramatically. “What! Are you *accusing* the Great Lucifer, ruler of Hell, of falsifying documents? I am *offended!*”

The guards blinked.

Justice chuckled. “I think what our friend means is… do you really wanna be the guys who say *no* to Lucifer at Heaven’s biggest party?”

The guards hesitated.

Then, finally, one of them sighed and stepped aside.

“…Fine. Just behave yourselves.”

Lucifer grinned, patting one of them on the cheek as she walked past. “Oh, you *angelic* thing. I’ll be on my best behavior.”

Helltaker followed, shaking his head. That should not have worked.

**Step Two: Find the Vault.**

Inside, the Gala was every bit as extravagant as expected. Towering golden chandeliers, marble floors polished to perfection, and music so divine it made even Zdrada whistle in appreciation.

Celestial beings mingled with radiant, glowing souls. Waiters in flowing robes carried trays of ambrosia and divine delicacies.

And, somehow, Modeus already had a cocktail in hand. “I *love* Heaven! Why didn’t we visit sooner?”

“Focus,” Malina grumbled, typing on a small device. “I’m hacking into the records to find the vault location.”

Zdrada leaned over her shoulder. “You brought that into *Heaven*? Won’t that get smited or something?”

Malina shrugged. “If it does, at least I won’t have to deal with you guys anymore.”

Before Helltaker could say anything, he noticed Modeus staring at a group of angelic guards across the room. Her eyes sparkled.

“…It’s time,” she whispered dramatically.

Helltaker barely had time to react before Modeus strode forward and “accidentally” tripped, spilling her drink all over one of the guards.

The angel stammered, face turning bright red. “I-I—ah—miss, please—”

Modeus gasped, placing a delicate hand on her chest. “Oh no! I’m *so* sorry! Here, let me clean that for you…” She dabbed at her uniform, making sure to lean in a little too close.

The guard completely shut down.

The other angels shifted awkwardly, trying *very* hard not to stare.

“Distraction successful,” Justice whispered with a grin.

“Way too successful,” Malina muttered, dragging them toward a side hallway.

Step Three: Steal Lucifer’s Trident.

After sneaking past a few more patrols (and one unfortunate angel who was now unconscious in a broom closet, thanks to Zdrada), they arrived at the vault doors.

Lucifer clapped her hands. “Now, let’s crack this baby open!”

Malina typed furiously on her device. “Give me a minute…”

Helltaker crossed his arms. “I still don’t get why you *need* this thing.”

Lucifer pouted. “Darling, it’s my trident. Heaven confiscated it after my little *incident* eons ago. It’s a matter of *principle.*”

Helltaker sighed. “I just wanted a normal life.”

Zdrada smirked. “Dude, you literally went to Hell for demon girls.”

Before he could respond, Malina let out a triumphant “Got it!” and the vault doors slid open.

Inside, the room gleamed with untold treasures. Holy relics, celestial artifacts, divine weapons—

And at the very center, resting on a pedestal, was Lucifer’s gleaming, pitch-black trident.

“Jackpot,” Lucifer whispered, stepping forward.

The moment her fingers touched it, alarms blared across the entire vault.

The group collectively groaned.

“Of course,” Malina snapped. “Of *course* it had an alarm.”

Lucifer twirled the trident, smiling. “Well, I suppose that means—”

The doors slammed shut behind them, sealing them in.

A booming voice filled the air.

“INTRUDERS DETECTED. SECURITY MEASURES ACTIVATED.”

Golden light flared as armored archangels descended from above, weapons drawn.

Justice stretched. “Ahhh, here we go.”

Helltaker rolled up his sleeves. “We’re fighting our way out, huh?”

Lucifer grinned, spinning her trident. “Why not? We’re already in deep.”

Malina sighed, pulling out a stolen angelic sword. “I *hate* you guys.”

Zdrada cracked her knuckles. “Time to punch some holy dudes.”

Modeus squealed, clapping. “I *knew* there’d be drama!”

Azazel, meanwhile, collapsed to the floor. “I’m going to be so exiled.”

As the first wave of angels charged, Lucifer laughed.

This was going to be *good*.

Helltaker had faced a lot of absurd situations in his life. Bargaining with demons? Done that. Bringing them into the mortal world? Easy. Keeping them from destroying his apartment on a daily basis? A nightmare, but manageable.

But planning a **heist in Heaven**? That was a whole new level of insanity.

Lucifer had gathered the group in their cramped living room, which now resembled a makeshift war room. A crudely drawn map of Heaven was pinned to the wall (sketched by Azazel, who *insisted* she had no part in this). Sticky notes labeled *""Angel patrol routes""*, *""Security wards""*, and *""How to not get smited""* were scattered across the coffee table.

Malina leaned against the couch with her arms crossed. “Alright, genius, how exactly do you expect us to even get *into* Heaven? Pretty sure they don’t just let demons waltz in.”

Lucifer smirked. “Oh, but they do! *Sort of.*” She turned to Azazel. “Tell them about the thing.”

Azazel flinched. “I-I still don’t think this is a good idea, but… um… there *is* an annual Heavenly Gala where even mortals and redeemed souls are allowed to visit.”

Lucifer clapped her hands. “Perfect! We’ll disguise ourselves as honored guests, sneak into the vault, and retrieve my trident before anyone notices.”

Helltaker sighed. “Why do I feel like we’ll be noticed *immediately*?”

Justice grinned, leaning back on the couch. “Because we absolutely will be. And it’ll be hilarious.”

Lucifer waved dismissively. “Details, details! Now, let’s assign roles. Every great heist has specialists, after all.”

She pulled out a piece of paper and started writing:

* **The Mastermind:** Herself, of course.
* **The Muscle:** Helltaker. (He groaned but didn’t argue.)
* **The Hacker:** Malina. (""This is so stupid,"" she muttered, but continued typing.)
* **The Infiltrator:** Zdrada. (“Cool. I call dibs on punching an angel.”)
* **The Distraction:** Modeus. (“Wait, what?”)
* **The Inside Woman:** Azazel. (“Wha—No! I’m not helping!!”)
* **The Getaway Driver:** Justice. (“Do I get to drive an angel chariot? Please say yes.”)
* **The Backup:** Pandemonica. (Who simply adjusted her glasses and sipped her coffee, saying nothing.)

Modeus looked genuinely confused. “Why am *I* the distraction?”

Lucifer smiled. “Sweetheart, you’re the demon of lust. Just… **exist**, and every angel in a ten-mile radius will be too flustered to focus.”

Modeus gasped. “Are we doing the *seductive spy* act?! Oh my Hell, I *love* those stories!”

Malina groaned. “I’m in actual hell.”

Helltaker just crossed his arms. “I assume I don’t get a choice in this?”

Lucifer patted his shoulder. “Darling, you never had a choice the moment you went to Hell for demon waifus.”

He sighed. She had a point.

# A Hell of a Heist – Part 3

The night of the Heavenly Gala arrived faster than Helltaker would have liked.

Despite all the planning (which consisted mostly of Lucifer making things up on the spot and everyone else complaining), the group now stood before the Pearly Gates. The towering entrance shimmered with divine light, guarded by a pair of stoic archangels in pristine golden armor.

Helltaker adjusted the uncomfortable white suit Lucifer had forced him into. “This is a terrible idea.”

“This is a *brilliant* idea,” Lucifer corrected, adjusting her extravagant fur-lined cape. “And you *look amazing,* darling.”

The others were similarly dressed. Malina had ditched her usual wear for a sleek black 3 peice suit, arms crossed and already regretting everything. Justice, ever confident, strolled beside her in an all-white tuxedo, grinning as if they weren’t seconds away from a celestial disaster.

Modeus, wearing a dress *far* too elegant for a heist, was practically bouncing in place. “This is so exciting! Do you think there will be *drama*? A forbidden romance?!”

Zdrada, somehow managing to look both classy and completely uninterested, exhaled a puff of smoke. “If by drama you mean a massive fight, then yeah. Definitely.”

Azazel, meanwhile, was an absolute wreck.

“I can’t believe I’m doing this,” the angel muttered, clutching a clipboard as she led the group forward. “If we get caught, I’ll be exiled, I’ll lose my research privileges, and—”

“Relax,” Lucifer said, patting Azazel’s head. “That’s only *if* we get caught.”

Azazel whimpered.

**Step One: Get Inside.**

As they reached the gates, the angel guards blocked their path. One of them narrowed her eyes at Helltaker.

“Name and purpose?”

Azazel stepped forward, her voice shaking. “Um, honored guests for the Heavenly Gala! I, uh, submitted their names earlier… under the *Academic Observers of the Mortal-Demonic Relations Initiative.*”

The guards looked at each other.

“…That’s not a real thing,” one said.

Azazel paled.

Lucifer, without missing a beat, clutched her chest dramatically. “What! Are you *accusing* the Great Lucifer, ruler of Hell, of falsifying documents? I am *offended!*”

The guards blinked.

Justice chuckled. “I think what our friend means is… do you really wanna be the guys who say *no* to Lucifer at Heaven’s biggest party?”

The guards hesitated.

Then, finally, one of them sighed and stepped aside.

“…Fine. Just behave yourselves.”

Lucifer grinned, patting one of them on the cheek as she walked past. “Oh, you *angelic* thing. I’ll be on my best behavior.”

Helltaker followed, shaking his head. That should not have worked.

**Step Two: Find the Vault.**

Inside, the Gala was every bit as extravagant as expected. Towering golden chandeliers, marble floors polished to perfection, and music so divine it made even Zdrada whistle in appreciation.

Celestial beings mingled with radiant, glowing souls. Waiters in flowing robes carried trays of ambrosia and divine delicacies.

And, somehow, Modeus already had a cocktail in hand. “I *love* Heaven! Why didn’t we visit sooner?”

“Focus,” Malina grumbled, typing on a small device. “I’m hacking into the records to find the vault location.”

Zdrada leaned over her shoulder. “You brought that into *Heaven*? Won’t that get smited or something?”

Malina shrugged. “If it does, at least I won’t have to deal with you guys anymore.”

Before Helltaker could say anything, he noticed Modeus staring at a group of angelic guards across the room. Her eyes sparkled.

“…It’s time,” she whispered dramatically.

Helltaker barely had time to react before Modeus strode forward and “accidentally” tripped, spilling her drink all over one of the guards.

The angel stammered, face turning bright red. “I-I—ah—miss, please—”

Modeus gasped, placing a delicate hand on her chest. “Oh no! I’m *so* sorry! Here, let me clean that for you…” She dabbed at her uniform, making sure to lean in a little too close.

The guard completely shut down.

The other angels shifted awkwardly, trying *very* hard not to stare.

“Distraction successful,” Justice whispered with a grin.

“Way too successful,” Malina muttered, dragging them toward a side hallway.

Step Three: Steal Lucifer’s Trident.

After sneaking past a few more patrols (and one unfortunate angel who was now unconscious in a broom closet, thanks to Zdrada), they arrived at the vault doors.

Lucifer clapped her hands. “Now, let’s crack this baby open!”

Malina typed furiously on her device. “Give me a minute…”

Helltaker crossed his arms. “I still don’t get why you *need* this thing.”

Lucifer pouted. “Darling, it’s my trident. Heaven confiscated it after my little *incident* eons ago. It’s a matter of *principle.*”

Helltaker sighed. “I just wanted a normal life.”

Zdrada smirked. “Dude, you literally went to Hell for demon girls.”

Before he could respond, Malina let out a triumphant “Got it!” and the vault doors slid open.

Inside, the room gleamed with untold treasures. Holy relics, celestial artifacts, divine weapons—

And at the very center, resting on a pedestal, was Lucifer’s gleaming, pitch-black trident.

“Jackpot,” Lucifer whispered, stepping forward.

The moment her fingers touched it, alarms blared across the entire vault.

The group collectively groaned.

“Of course,” Malina snapped. “Of *course* it had an alarm.”

Lucifer twirled the trident, smiling. “Well, I suppose that means—”

The doors slammed shut behind them, sealing them in.

A booming voice filled the air.

“INTRUDERS DETECTED. SECURITY MEASURES ACTIVATED.”

Golden light flared as armored archangels descended from above, weapons drawn.

Justice stretched. “Ahhh, here we go.”

Helltaker rolled up his sleeves. “We’re fighting our way out, huh?”

Lucifer grinned, spinning her trident. “Why not? We’re already in deep.”

Malina sighed, pulling out a stolen angelic sword. “I *hate* you guys.”

Zdrada cracked her knuckles. “Time to punch some holy dudes.”

Modeus squealed, clapping. “I *knew* there’d be drama!”

Azazel, meanwhile, collapsed to the floor. “I’m going to be so exiled.”

As the first wave of angels charged, Lucifer laughed.

This was going to be *good*.

My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how much coffee I drank, it felt like my brain was running on fumes. I couldn’t focus, couldn’t think clearly, and the fatigue wasn’t just physical—it was mental, emotional, and relentless.

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow.

It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

1ifdjmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1ifdjmk/how_do_i_maintain_a_relationship_with_one_parent/,How do I maintain a relationship with one parent while despising the other?,"My father has always believed the world should revolve around him. Growing up,  my dad was a musician and traveled. Small town stuff,  nothing that made enough money to actually be sending home to contribute. My mom worked 2 and 3 jobs for most of my childhood,  I have very few memories of her from that time. Mostly babysitters. And we were still pretty poor. My fathers needs always came first. My dad would leave take out laid everywhere from the night before when he left his show or party and had a feast(for my mom to clean) and we would get up lucky to see a poptart in the cabinet. My mom would already be at work,  my dad passed out and we would get ready for school. We couldn't keep most food in the house that you would keep on hand for kids because my dad would eat it all. I'm talking a tub of ice cream in one night,  an entire cereal box in one day sitting at home,  little Debbies? FORGET IT,  NOT A CHANCE. We couldn't afford it at that rate. So the only food kept in the house was ingredients for dinners and Ramen noodles. One of my favorite snacks would be A1 sauce in a measuring cup,  eating it with a spoon. My brother and myself were pretty self sufficient for this reason. 

When I think back,  I remember when times were spent with extended family or doing anything it was somewhat of a party scene. Drinking, violence and drugs were normal on my father's side of the family or at events we would go to. Very toxic in about every way. Now in my mid 30s I have heard stories of myself being given alcohol on multiple occasions at very young ages. Not regularly or getting me wasted as a 6 year old but even allowing a few drinks just seems so wild to me as a mother myself. 

I feel like I've learned punishments were on the next level. We were the kids that stood in the corner for 4 hours with no sitting,  no breaks,  no drinks. We were the kids who had a designated whooping leather belt. We were supposed to be grateful for this because his mom used her fist and would punch him in the face when he was in trouble. I was grounded for almost 2 years of my life based on 2 teenage mistakes. I admit,  we were not angels.  We were a product of our upbringing and we acted like it. 

Once we were hitting our teen years my mom lost her job and pulled a big move and bravely went back to school. She got a good job still being the main financial contributor. Most of the time the only contributor. So the moment I turned 16 I got a job a McDonald's. It was like the world opened up to me for the first time. I could buy food when I was hungry.  I could buy school clothes. (My family took up a collection of about $40 for my school clothes from family dollar the year before). I could actually go do the things my friends were doing and didn't have to feel like the mooch that only could if someone else paid for me. It was nice. But shortly in my mom asked me if I could help with a few bills. Which became the normal, handing over so much of my paycheck every pay day. In trying to afford doing that and still having money for myself I started working 40 hours a week ontop of going to school full time. My mom understood and tried to help, even doing some of my school work for me. My dad will still tell me to this day I only passed because my mom did my work. Spent every summer in summer school trying to catch back up. I had to drop out my senior year and home school so that the schoolwork load was lighter and my time frame was looser, it took me an extra year to graduate. 

 I couldn't afford my license and a car until I was 21.  I've spent my adult life unlearning alot of things. I ended up in a relationship very similar to my parents with basically a carbon copy of my father for a partner. At 22 I had my son. When my son was 8, I reconized so much of my life and his childhood from my own,  I was so unhappy. I was so scared. I was at that point determined to get help and make things better. I was diagnosed bipolar(thanks dad who I think is undiagnosed and so untreated). I learned that it is near impossible to make a situation better when getting help and putting in effort is one sided.(baby dad admits to some sort of undiagnosed mental issues himself). It was such a slap in the face. How could I have allowed 2 people suffering from mental health disorders to bring a child into a toxic situation?? We were high school sweethearts. Young and dumb. Being young and dumb we suffered 2 miscarriages before our son came along. I felt like the world was trying to tell me something and I was blind and deaf. I did it any way. And my son had his own things we deal with as a result. When your young and in love you think,  I can take these 2 broken people and make a whole and it's us against the world! That's the dumb aspect. 
At 8 years old I ripped my sons world apart and we separated. Although I stupidly jumped into another relationship with a friend I'd known since I was 13(long distance, lived states apart) i tried focusing on providing a life for my son on my own. I was stubborn. I got a good job,  our own place, had my own vehicle,  we had a dog and life was good. But I wasnt prefect. I was ignoring some relationship red flags. Overlooking to see the picture of the stability and better environment my son could benefit from. What's wrong with letting myself... not be great if the situation is great for my kid? My son's father was not exactly stable, a good 6 months of no shows happened... Drug use. Homelessness. It was during covid. Things were crazy. 

That current relationship was 72 levels above.. what WAS. What I came from. After 2 years we took the step of living together. 4 months in I regretted it so bad.  I felt like I was lied to for 2 years. The stable life I was being shown all that time was not so stable. And even though it's was a life free of what I thought of as bad,  no violence, no drugs, no alcohol... there are other ways to be toxic. I learned other things that I did not want my son to learn and other ways that I didn't want my son to think was okay. I learned that me and my son could both have what we deserve. There were still tendencies I found in this person that I saw in my dad. And it was enough to walk away from. 

So. Once again. I packed up my son and we went out on our own once again. 

Now my mom has been there through all of this for me. She's the only one who would come over and help me pack,  help me move,  she would spend an hour on the phone with me when I was upset,  she would buy my son anything he ever needed,  take him anywhere he needed if I couldn't. Once my son came along my mom was obsessed. My sons childhood with my parents had been night and day compared to mine. They let him do alot and have alot.

 The problem with that is it has caused my father to become extremely jealous of me or my son at times. She can't do anything for us without also doing something for him. And if she is with us doing anything, he will call her 15 times. He will find any reason to be an ass and treat her like shit. He even will find excuses for her to come back sooner. He finds ways to ruin or make things less fun. If I go to a coffee shop on my way to get my kid from them and I grab her a coffee(he doesn't drink it) he throws a fit to her after I leave because I didn't go out of my way to go across town and get him a chocolate milkshake so he had something too. I can't call her up and say hey,  ABC is going on,  I come get you,  let's go check it out because he will throw a fit. Well maybe the house was dirty,  the floors needed swept or dinner needed made. The garage needs cleaned out,  weeds need pulled, SOMETHING could have gotten done if she didn't go off and have fun for 2 hours,  god forbid(all while he is to disabled to do any of this things). But if she didn't go,  none of that stuff would have been done or even brought up anyway. 

So here we are. My son is 12. I have been single mom life for years,  no dating,  no want to date. Ick. And I'm obsessed with my kid and our dogs. I don't drink or party, I've cut off everyone toxic and I basically keep kind of to myself in life. My days are FULL and I have many hobbies that I'm elbow deep in and love! 
The problem I'm having now is in this time I have raised the bar on expectations. Realizing I can give myself the things I want and I can provide the life I want my son to learn from myself. I have seen and realized things from my childhood through my adult eyes. I have an understanding and clarity that I guess only comes with age and experience. I've been spending this time trying to make sure I build the relationship with my son that he needs from his mom. The typical,  I want my kid to have everything I didn't. Including not having the trauma I did. I've never had to take a belt to my son, I've never had to stand him in a corner,  I've never had to scream cuss words at him. I might have busted his butt twice as a toddler. I've never had to ground him. We've always been able to talk. He's always understood. All I had to do was sit down with him and explain. Give him the chance to understand. 

I had my first run in with the law at his age. I couldn't even imagine him doing anything wrong for me,  let alone the law. 

One of the things we have talked about is his papaw. But as time goes on,  even though I have talked to my dad several times about it, my dad will lose his cool over anything which causes him then to go off about everything in front of my kid. He tossed and turned and didn't sleep great. My son woke up after staying the night (the office/his room is off of the main bedroom) walked through the room talking to himself while he looked at his phone and that woke my dad up. So he bitched me out that I need to teach my son respect and that even though it's day time, he sleeps during the day and my son needs to keep his fucking mouth shut while he's sleeping. Then continued to bitch about my son being downstairs playing a video game and yelled at the TV and it's fucking  ridiculous that he's that loud over a video game.

 Keep in mind I'm only being about 25% a colorful as he was with his language and my son could hear everything he was saying.

 I went to collect my son off his game to leave(as my dad is still going on and on about anything and everything very colorfully) he ended up talking shit about my mom and I lost it. He literally says my mom is his slave and there to take care of him, he comes first and everything is her responsibility and fault. I've watched this man carry 5 gallon buckets of water up and down the stairs for something that he wants to do and is important to him. But claims he is so disabled he can't bend over to pick up a piece of trash the dog gets out of the bin. He so disabled he can't pick up the vacuum cleaner because he can't lift more than 2 pounds. I've seen this man mow the yard,  set up a tent, plant his weed garden. But he's so disabled he can't shut a gate when we walks through the door because if he does it more than a few times his shoulder hurts. So he leaves it open,  which let's the dog through to the bathroom where he pees on the floor. Which my mom cleans up because it's her dog,  not his. He will leave the pee on the floor all day until my mom is off work to clean it up because he's to disabled. He wants the dog trained but says my mom should do research in-between calls at work or in between making dinner,  picking up his prescriptions, going to the grocery store and the meat market. While he does not work and sits home all day. Because it's her dog not his. But guess what... they have 2 dogs. And ""his"" dog also poops inside. Guess who cleans that up... mom. Because he's disabled. But his dog doesn't need trained. 
I think he sits at home all day,  not letting them out so they do what they gotta. 

And it's my mom's fault. I sent my son to the car and couldn't hold back telling him how dumb he is. How absurd it all is. He just argued back and dug in his heels. I stormed out.  Idk what to do anymore.  My mental health cannot handle that,  I don't want the behavior around my son. My dads way of thinking is not right and I don't ever want my son to think any thing he thinks is okay.  But in order to see my mom who is his best friend and he is her world,  we have to be subjected to my father. Alot of times he can be ignored or interacted with minimally. But his rantings are more and more. I've told my mom even though he physically can do these things but he wants to claim to be so disabled he can't then he needs to go into assisted living or something. My mom puts my kid on the bus and gets him off. We live right across the street so he freely likes to go hang out over there as he wants. Plus they keep my dogs while I'm working. (My mom works from home) I literally have no one else in this world. It's me and my son.  His dad pops up every now and then for a weekend but he is married and has a new baby,  lives about 30 min away. I take him there whence he wants to go but he mostly turns his dad down when he asks. My son would rather stay with his mimi on the weekends. My brother lives an hour and a half away with his wife. I have cut what 2 Friends I had a few years ago,  just in time cuzz one is now in prison. My mom is basically it. She's both of our best friend. She's all we have around here. You start to feel comfortable,  letting your kid get comfortable, ""at home"" at grandmas house.  Like you think you should be able to. And then you get an episode of just getting verbally trashed about everything you or your kid does. Oh so it was a problem that we had breakfast here? My son ate all the cinnamon rolls and your eggs, bacon and biscuits(that my son doesn't eat) wasnt enough? My son can't eat because they are for you? Your ""sick"" of never getting cinnamon rolls because it's the only breakfast food my autistic son eats here? Oh okay,  got it. 👍 so now I'm not comfortable here any more but my son doesn't know or understand this things you've said. And still wants to come. He doesn't know that him just being a kid has pissed off his papaw so bad and his papaw thinks I need to teach him respect. Now I don't want my son in an environment he has to have anxiety and walk on egg shells in but he doesn't know any of that and wants to go. What do I do? If it's healthy or not,  idk but I have mastered cutting ppl off that are toxic and do not benefit us or our life. 

How do you cut someone off that lives in the house with someone else you spend every day with? What do you do?? 

I've almost given my mom an ultimatum. But she spent nearly 40 years with the man. It's all she knows,  she's waiting on him to die I think. But he's not that old,  he will probably outlive us all out of spite to the world. That can't be the only option. She won't leave him. 
So where does that leave us? Sorry this ended up being more of a rant to get it off my chest than anything else. These other stories helped me feel like others can relate...",1,1738436466.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow.

It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

I don't know if this is the right place to write what I want or if ""life crisis"" is the right words for my experience,

Also i'm sorry for any grammar mistakes because english is not my first language

Two months ago i turned 30 and i wasn't happy at all, In fact i was in deep psychological dysphoria because i started to think my so far life. I feel like i wasted my twenties (twenties are very important years for people to become more mature, have experiences and learn skills)

I am autistic with adhd and i believe because of these two conditions i developed dysthymia, cptsd and social anxiety since i was still a child (not officially diagnosed but i relate to most symptoms of these conditions). My five conditions went untreated

I tried to ""fix"" my social anxiety with the most easy to find drug ""alcohol"" and that wasn't the best idea because it led me to have alcohol problem

Since i was 16 and mostly at my 20 and later i was drinking alcohol so i could be comfortable with people and loud environments

I love this kind of numbness/euphoria alcohol gives me I am more relaxed, comfortable, energized and social I can being touched or listening to loud sudden noises without me jumping and startling in fear

My parents are good people, i know they love me, i still live with them, but that doesn't mean they weren't traumatized me. I guess they didn't know other way to raise me as a child and teenager other than being physically and mentally abusive when i was naughty or didn't listening to them and when they caughted me masturbating

Also they were emotional neglectful too because i guess that's only they knew from their parents

Even though they treat me better now i still kinda afraid of them (especially my mother because she was the most strict one). I afraid to tell them my feelings and thoughts or whatever. I afraid that they will criticize me or look at me with disappointment I get triggered and anxious many times even if i'm in the same room with them so i close myself in my room all the time

I believe i wasted my twenties because i couldn't get a single degree, i didn't have motivation, i was so bored that felt pointless to continue, i couldn't focus, i had brain fog and i was afraid failure.

Because of my extreme shyness, self-loathing and fear i never had a job Everyone around me think i'm lazy, i don't know if they right or not but it's difficult to do something if it's really boring, i need something to stimulate my brain, coffee helps even temporary sometimes

I believe i wasted my twenties because i could have done sex, so far i had done it 2 times, while being drunk because of my anxiety, but i wanted more.

Mentally i'm extreme shy and scared but my body needs intimacy and sex by a lot of partners. I try to satisfy my sexual urges and desires through masturbation and fantasies. I'm so jealous of other women who have the courage to actively have sex whenever they want with different men.

I believe i wasted my twenties because i didn't take care my appearance that much but i guess i can now because 30 years old is still young i guess But still i feel like i wasted my youth, so many opportunities and experiences

All of these led me to feel behind in life than people my age (even younger ones) Emotionally and mentally i feel behind

I'm sorry for this long post

I just got back from a birthday party for one of my son’s daycare friends.  As I was walking in the first thing I noticed was a bounce house and slide which calmed my nerves (somewhat) that my son would have some outlet while he was getting pumped full of sugar.

The next thing I noticed was the bar as this party was held in an event hall (alcoholic brain in action).  The bar was set up as one of those build your own mimosa stations.  Old me would have been immediately  been all over that once I got my son situated (sad, I know).  Sober me stuck to water, coffee, and just maaaaaybe an Elsa cookie or two.  

I also picked up on at least one other dad who came in and immediately started chatting me up with alcohol on his breath, then proceeded to the station as I predicted.  I’ve been there, but man it feels so good being present for my son, and enjoying the conversations around me instead of just numbing myself.  It’s also very interesting  that the smell of alcohol you pick up on once you’ve stopped for a while…makes me cringe thinking I always smelled that way.

Anyways, I just wanted to get that off my chest.  I’m not perfect but I’m trying to be better for myself and my son.  IWNDWYT.",4,1738436307.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

umm....hi

I’m a  final-year post graduation student (graduating this summer!) who moved here two years ago for my postgraduate studies. While I did love exploring the city and eating biryani to my fullest (cafe bahar ftw), I’d love to meet someone who’s into slow, intentional connections.

Coming to me.... I'm 6'0 (idk why this is important but i saw all the posts mention the height) and as I already got placed in my 3rd semester itself and started working I’m basically juggling both the textbooks and coding projects—debugging is basically my second language, at this point.

 I also LOVE to read books so most of the nights you’ll find me curled up with a philosophy book  (i know this sounds soo fucking superficial and fake but trust me 🥲 i basically go through many genres and currently it's philosophy, it used to be economic literature last year lol)  

I also love watching movies like most people do and currently I'm going through old classics especially the ones by Akira Kurosawa, there's something about his films that feels like a conversation with history itself—Yojimbo, with its lone samurai navigating moral gray zones, is my forever favorite. I'm also a avid music listener, Weeknd is my favourite artist of this era but in general I like listening to the classics spanning from Abbey Road by the Beetles to Kid A by the Radiohead, I don't have a particular genre to be honest lol

Back home, I used to spend my free time in libraries but I haven’t explored many libraries here yet, mostly because I don’t know where to start. It’d be great to discover some with someone who enjoys the same.

and ohhh I'm fluent in Telugu, Hindi, and English by the way :)

and uhhhh what I'm looking for is someone who wants to skip the small talk and dive into actual conversations. I’m old-school when it comes to dating—I’d rather take things slow, get to know each other’s stories, and build trust before anything else.

\*\*Chapter 1: The Prospect Park Adventure Begins\*\*



The sun was just peeking over the horizon as Pete the Puggle sat in the backseat of his parents' SUV, his tail

wagging with excitement. He’d been looking forward to their second trip to Prospect Park all week. Last year’s

visit had been nothing short of magical, but this time, Pete knew things would be different. He’d grown older,

wiser, and more adventurous. His big brother Roman was sitting beside him, already humming a catchy tune that Pete

couldn’t help but join in on.



“Prospect Park, here we come!” Mariya, Pete’s mom, sang as she adjusted her sunglasses. Lenny, Pete’s dad, was

driving with a map clutched tightly in one hand and a thermos of coffee in the other. “Remember to keep an eye out

for wildlife,” he said, glancing at Roman in the rearview mirror. “And no running off this time.”



Pete squirmed in his seat, his curiosity getting the better of him. He wanted to explore every inch of the park,

from the dense woods to the serene meadows. But first, there was one thing on his mind. As soon as they arrived,

he planned to find Ginger, the Italian Cane Corso he’d met at a local dog event last month.



“Alright, Pete,” Roman said, nudging him with an elbow. “We’ll get there soon enough. Just don’t forget what

happened last time.”



Pete shivered at the reminder of their first visit. They’d gotten lost in the woods, spent hours searching for a

way back, and ended up finding a hidden meadow filled with wildflowers. But that was all behind them now.



As the SUV pulled into the park, Pete’s heart raced. The familiar sights of the entrance—the information kiosk,

the wide gravel path—filled him with a sense of nostalgia. He couldn’t wait to see what adventures waited for them

this time.



\---



\*\*Chapter 2: A Reunion with Ginger\*\*



The family headed toward the meadow where they’d met Ginger last year. Pete’s tail was already wagging just at the

thought of seeing her again. But as they approached, he noticed something different. The area was quiet, almost

too quiet. The usual sounds of birds chirping and squirrels scurrying about were absent.



“Something feels off,” Mariya murmured, frowning.



Just then, a soft bark echoed from the trees. Pete’s heart leaped as Ginger emerged, her chocolate-brown coat

gleaming in the sunlight. She was just as beautiful as he remembered, with her muscular build and calm,

intelligent eyes. She trotted over, her tail wagging slowly, as if she too was nervous.



“Hey, Ginger,” Pete said, his voice trembling with excitement. “It’s so good to see you again!”



Ginger tilted her head, her ears perking up. She seemed hesitant but also curious. Then, without warning, she

broke into a slow gallop, meeting Pete halfway. He dropped to his knees, wrapping his small paws around her neck

in delight.



“Hey there,” he whispered, nuzzling her. “You’ve changed.”



“I can say the same about you,” Ginger said, her voice deep and melodic. She bumped him gently with her shoulder,

pushing him back onto all fours.



Pete stood up, his heart swelling with happiness. He’d missed her fiercely over the past year. But as he looked at

her now, he realized something felt… different. She seemed distant, almost guarded. What could have changed

between them?



“Are you okay?” Pete asked, worried. “You seem off.”



Ginger paused, her tail giving a small twitch. “I’ve been busy,” she said finally, her tone soft but unreadable.

“But it’s good to see you again, Pete.”



Pete nodded, though a shadow of doubt lingered in his mind. He’d have to figure out what was going on with Ginger

later. For now, he was just glad to have her back in his life.



\---



\*\*Chapter 3: A Mischievous Afternoon\*\*



The family spent the afternoon exploring the park, but Pete couldn’t stop glancing at Ginger. He wanted to spend

time alone with her, to catch up properly. But Roman kept getting in the way, teasing him mercilessly.



“Come on, Pete,” his brother said, tugging at his leash. “Let’s race you to that tree!”



Pete hesitated, looking at Ginger for support. She gave him a small nod, encouraging him to go. With a playful

bark, he darted after Roman.



The race was inevitable, but Pete didn’t mind. He loved the thrill of the chase. As they bolted through the

meadow, the wind whipping through his fur, he couldn’t help but laugh. Roman was faster than ever, though. He

yanked the leash out of Pete’s reach at the last second, leaving him panting and defeated.



“Silly brother,” Pete said, shaking his head as he trudged back to Ginger. “You’re no fun.”



Ginger nuzzled him gently, her presence comforting and familiar. Pete leaned into her touch, feeling a spark of

connection that hadn’t been there before. Maybe things weren’t so bad after all.



\---



\*\*Chapter 4: A Hidden Discovery\*\*



As the afternoon wore on, the family decided to venture deeper into the park. They followed a winding trail into

the woods, where the trees towered overhead, casting dappled shadows on the ground. Pete’s heart raced with

excitement, his nose twitching at every sound.



But as they entered the forest, something felt… off. The air was thick and still, and the usual sounds of the

forest were absent. Pete’s fur stood on end, and he could feel a strange tension in the air.



“Let’s turn back,” Mariya suggested, her voice tight. “Something feels wrong.”



But before anyone could react, a sound echoed through the trees—a low, guttural growl. Pete’s tail dropped, and he

cowered behind his parents, his heart pounding.



“What was that?” Lenny muttered, scanning the woods with a frown.



Just then, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was unlike anything Pete had ever seen before. The creature stood

on four massive legs, its fur matted and mangy, its eyes glowing an eerie red. It let out another growl, this time

closer.



Pete’s legs went weak, and he could feel his parents tense beside him. But as the creature took a step toward

them, Ginger suddenly pushed past the family, her body blocking their path.



“Stay back,” she snarled, her voice low and dangerous. The creature hesitated, its glowing eyes fixed on her.



Pete watched in awe as Ginger faced down the creature, her fur bristling with fear but her stance firm. She didn’t

know what was coming, he realized, but she’d put herself between them anyway.



\---



\*\*Chapter 5: A New Ally\*\*



The standoff lasted only a moment before the creature let out a guttural roar and lunged at Ginger. Pete’s heart

leapt into his throat as he watched, but Ginger moved swiftly, dodging the attack with ease. Shecountered with a

snap of her jaws, forcing the creature to retreat.



“Nice going,” Lenny said, shaking his head in disbelief. “You almost got us killed.”



Ginger ignored him, keeping her wary gaze on the creature as it disappeared into the shadows. Pete couldn’t help

but feel a surge of admiration for her. She’d saved them without hesitation, proving herself to be far more than

just a friendly face.



But as the family began to relax, Pete noticed something else. The strange tension in the air had lifted, and the

forest seemed peaceful once more. It was almost as if the creature had never been there at all.



\---



\*\*Chapter 6: The Real Enemy\*\*



The next day, the family returned to their usual spot in the meadow. But as they set up their picnic, Pete

couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. He kept glancing at Ginger, trying to read her unreadable

expression.



“Are you sure you’re okay?” he asked for the third time.



“I’m fine,” she said, her tone softer now. “But we need to talk.”



Pete’s ears perked up. “What do you mean?”



Ginger looked him dead in the eye, her gaze steady and unyielding. “There’s something I’ve been keeping from you,”

she admitted. “Something I didn’t realize until now.”



Pete’s stomach dropped. Whatever she was about to say could only be bad.



\---



\*\*Chapter 7: A New Reality\*\*



Ginger crouched down, her eyes reflecting the sunlight as she spoke. “I’m not just a dog,” she said, her voice low

and serious. “I’m… different.”



Pete’s mind reeled. He’d always thought of Ginger as just another animal, someone he could play with and build a

bond with. But now, that illusion was shattered.



“I’m a guardian,” she continued, her tone heavy. “It’s my job to protect you, whether you like it or not.”



Pete’s heart pounded in his chest. “What does that mean?”



“It means I’ve been watching you,” Ginger said, her voice soft but firm. “I’ve been part of your life for a

reason. And now, with the creature… it’s coming for us.”



Pete felt a cold dread settle in his heart. The strange encounter yesterday had been just the beginning.



“Why me?” he asked, his voice trembling.



Ginger hesitated, her gaze dropping to the ground before she met his eyes again. “You’re special,” she said.

“There’s something inside you that the creature wants.”



Pete’s legs felt weak, and he sat down heavily on the ground. He could feel Ginger’s presence beside him, her

warmth a small comfort in the face of the terror that had been revealed.



\---



\*\*Chapter 8: The Final Battle\*\*



The next few days passed in a blur of fear and preparation. Ginger explained that the creature was a shifter, a

being with the ability to take on the form of whatever it wanted. And she’d been trying to protect Pete from it

for years, though he had no memory of their previous encounters.



But now, the creature had found them again, and it wouldn’t stop until it had Pete.



Ginger trained Pete relentlessly, teaching him how to fight and run. She showed him the hidden passages in his

house, places where he could hide if needed. And she told him about the other guardians, the ones who had been

protecting him from creatures like this one for years.



On the night of the attack, Pete was ready. He knew what he had to do, though it would be the hardest thing he’d

ever faced.



\---



\*\*Chapter 9: The Last Stand\*\*



The creature came in the dead of night, emerging from the shadows with a growl that echoed through the house. Pete

was ready, his heart pounding as he stood beside Ginger.



“Stay behind me,” she said, her voice firm.



But Pete knew what had to be done. As the creature lunged at her, he acted on instinct, throwing himself in front

of her. The force of the attack knocked him to the ground, but he clung to the creature, wrapping his arms around

its legs.



The creature roared in anger, thrashing to get free. But Pete held on, using all his strength to subdue it. He

could feel its power coursing through him, but he didn’t let go.



With a final, desperate burst of energy, the creature broke free and lunged at him. But this time, Pete was ready.



He raised his paw, aiming for the creature’s eyes. With all his strength, he struck, knocking it to the ground.



\---



\*\*Chapter 10: A New Dawn\*\*



The battle over, Pete collapsed onto the floor, exhausted but victorious. Ginger lay beside him, her fur matted

and dirty, but her eyes filled with pride.



“You’re stronger than I thought,” she said, nuzzling him gently.



Pete managed a weak smile, though his heart still raced from the ordeal. He knew that this wasn’t over, but for

now, he was safe.



And he had Ginger by his side, the guardian who had always been there, protecting him in ways he’d never fully

understood.



As the first light of dawn filtered through the windows, Pete realized something important. The creature had come

for him, but he had won. And with Ginger at his side, he knew that no matter what came next, he could face it

together.



The end. ? :)

Still decently new to all of the new things in Webkinz, and I had a couple questions!!!

1. When are the deluxe membership boxes supposed to appear in our dock? I purchased the 1 month deluxe towards the end of January, and I got a box (genuinely one of my favorite themes), but my understanding was that you are supposed to get one every month, or do I only get one?

2. Is the chocolate collection in the park only at certain times this month? I see the stand, but whenever I click on it, the info about it pops up, but nobody is with the stand. EDIT: omg Feb 7-14. Coffee hasn’t kicked in yet😭

3. Is Peek-a-newz running today? I am still seeing the Icy Mist Leopard as the POTM on there, and no figure is popping up. 

4. Are the hearts on the webkinz newz site yet? I have been playing around on it for a few minutes and have yet to see a heart!

Some days my V needs a cup of coffee to get going, but I've yet to find any food shops/vendors/diners that sell coffee.

I know you can buy two apartments that come with coffee makers, but I currently don't own those apartments. Tbh I might not bother with them at all as I like to hang out with >!Nibbles!<, and of course that *has* to be at the first apartment.

So far I've found a couple of to-go cups of coffee when looting, but they seem rare. I've been checking vending machines but they all seem to sell burritos, packeted juice(? or snack?) things, or sodas. No coffee vending machines that I can find.

Where in the city - preferably not way out on the outskirts - can I buy to-go coffee from any vendor, please?

Edit: extra info: I've looked at mods to add coffee too, but found nothing that quite does this. I tried the ""Street Vendors"" mod that allows you to buy things from various street vendors, but seems coffee is not part of their stock - at least not that I've found so far.

Mine was the effects of caffeine. I grew up Mormon so I didn’t have much exposure to caffeine as as child, maybe a soda here and then. But when I turned 18 and left that religion, I started going crazy with the coffee and energy drinks I was never allowed to have—I love them still. 

It was only then that my friends started acting bewildered that I was able to have so much caffeine and be completelpely fine. I fully thought they were lying to me about how it affected them. The concept of needing caffeine to feel alert or awake STILL feels so foreign to me. 

Many years later, I now know it’s because I went undiagnosed for so long, and was self-medicating the only was I knew how.

It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

Now, I’m not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it’s hard not to share it. I went from being skeptical to becoming a believer, not because of flashy marketing or exaggerated claims, but because of results I could see and feel every single day.​",1,1738435955.0,OKRABLEACH,0,1.0,False

I couldn’t focus, couldn’t think clearly, and the fatigue wasn’t just physical—it was mental, emotional, and relentless.

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

1ifd9r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ifd9r3/when_you_both_have_adhd_in_a_relationship/,When you both have ADHD in a relationship,"My partner and I both have ADHD, and they generally manifest in different ways.

I need at least like... Two hours to settle into a concentrated work session. We had talked about going to a coffee shop today to work on a Big Life Task today. I find coffee shops help me focus because it takes me out of the house and limits all the distractions. 

He blocks off three hours in the middle of the day for an activity he does. Which means there wasn't logistically enough time to do it in the AM, so we were going to do it this afternoon. I've been ready to go for the past twenty minutes and just in ADHD waiting mode. He just got home and added a shower and eating lunch to the things he needs to do before we leave, things that were not communicated ahead of time (he does not normally shower after this activity and it's well past when we usually eat lunch). So we're now back to not having enough time to do this coffee shop thing before we have to switch gears for dinner plans.

So his ADHD adds time blindness and an associated inability to math out all the tasks required of him (this is just an example - he regularly under estimates how much time something actually functionally takes). Because he doesn't see these sub tasks until they're right in front of him he can't communicate them to me.

And my ADHD is like if I don't have at least X amount of time, why bother doing it at all, as well as that stasis mode when you're waiting for the next step.

He's like oh well we'll work on it at home but... that's not how my brain works. I needed this Event to work on it. Now all the momentum I was building up with the anticipation of the Event is just gone.

1ifd8sz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ifd8sz,Another belated OOTD,"This one is from last week, which wound up being a bit hectic so I forgot to post it. I overall really liked this vibe — my brain was feeling dark academia and I wound up with this, which is probably more pirate-y than dark academia. I also wore a dark brownish purple lipstick with it. It’s a bit more visible-feeling than I usually go for, but I felt good in it overall! I didn’t do anything fancy, just went to the library and then a coffee shop to get some work done, and I had moments of feeling self-conscious, but they were (thankfully) fleeting. The item on the bodice is technically supposed to be a bustier but it’s too big, so I used it as a layering piece here and I think it worked with the belt. The second photo is literally just the same fit but with my coat on — I rather liked how the skirt looked with it. I don’t think it reads on camera, but my tights and my coat are both navy and the boots are black. 

I’d like to find a more casual way to wear the dress since I won’t always be in the mood to go full pirate, but I’m glad I have this combo in my arsenal! Especially once Renaissance Faire season comes around again. 😄

We've known eachother since we were 5 years old. Work came up and they were talking about job hopping, taking a year contract and then travelling, maybe starting saving for a house. It seemed like the world was their oyster. I never felt ""left behind"" in life, but they both got their masters' degrees in 2020, and I started one last year but am likely to drop out. I failed the first year, and thanks to a very generous lecturer believing in me, got a 1 year contract, but I have no idea what to do after that's up. I'm in an industry where you literally can't not have the masters. I will have to find something else, but have no idea what, then start at the bottom of it.

Where do I go from here?,"Hello and thank you.

My girlfriend and I have a relationship of ups and downs since April. We met in the city we lived and then she went away (5hr train) for work. So we became sorta long distance.

That was fine, because I wanted to make it work. I was unemployed at the time so I had more possibilities and occasions to visit her than viceversa. I spent a lot of time travelling from the two cities, often in the very first morning. I always participated in the expenses and never lived as a leech in her new house. I did this always and only for love, the discomfort was pretty much non existent when I thought of her face, voice and smile.

But there always has been a problem. She never came in my city (and hers) only for me. It was always some occasions where she made some time for me, like sleeping one night then going to family, with friends, etc. I was never not okay with her doing her things, of course. I was not okay, though, with her never coming for me as the first reason, and in a long distance relationship I value that. The commitment I feel must be somewhat reciprocated.

So, fast forward, since some times we didn't had a coffee, a beer, a dinner out, a night out in our original city where we met and I live. She comes down for her sister's birthday and sleeps at my place. The day after she went to family, hangs out with a friend for dinner then sleeps with me. 

Now, for the remaining time our plans where: go out after lunch, have coffee we two, hang out, walk in the city, find a present for her sister. I was excited! How much I longed for something like this! 

Then, her friend of the night before calls.
She stand up from the kitchen and goes picking up the phone. I overhear that she tells her that yes, we are totally fine going for a coffee in the center with her and her mother. I was very bitter. So, she hangs the phone with our new plans ready and comes back to eat. I then tell her I didn't quite like to be left out of plans that involves me and other people when we had our day planned, our day in the city since...months?

She lashes out. She starts raising her voice, accusing me of being antisocial, controlling and a man that wants her secluded and isolated from her friends. She even made comments, almost screaming, about how her exes were involved with her friends and family (her exes she described like abusives), while I don't want it. I felt gutted and hurt and like crying. I try to calm the tones and to talk, to resolve this like a couple, not with throwing plates. She bolted out the door to go without me at the coffee, saying that she didn't want to see even my shadow. I am devasted.

The evening at the party she kisses me in the lips in front of everyone and everything seems like a dream. I can't believe she can switch this way. I feel almost revolted not by her but by me that stand those situations. She doesn't seem to want to apologize and I tried to talk about it the next day, because I am hurt, but she seems okay with what she did and somehow I was the one at fault for even thinking that she should have like asked me if I was okay with the imminent change of plans (I would have been totally ok, it was a damn coffee, BUT ASK ME!)

How do I move? I am devastated.

1ifcwyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ifcwyx/what_lies_beneath/,What Lies Beneath,"""Happy birthday, sweetheart."" Mike O'Connor smiled at the phone's screen, where his daughter Katie showed off her new soccer uniform. ""You're gonna crush it at the game next week.""

""You'll be there, right?"" Katie's voice crackled through the speaker. ""You promised, Dad.""

Mike glanced at his watch. The Sterling Coal Mine's break room was empty except for him, the late afternoon shift change still an hour away. ""Wouldn't miss it for anything. First game as team captain? I'll be right there in the front row.""

After saying goodbye, Mike stared at the phone's wallpaper – Katie holding up her MVP trophy from last season. Everything he did, every extra shift and dangerous job, was to ensure she had opportunities he never had. His ex-wife didn't understand why he kept taking the riskiest assignments, but the hazard pay meant Katie could go to any college she wanted.

The break room door opened, and Jack Morrison walked in, his steel-gray hair dusty from the morning inspection. ""There you are. Marcus thinks he's found something interesting in the east tunnel.""

Mike tucked his phone away. ""Define interesting.""

""Interesting enough that Lisa's already down there with her radiation detector."" Jack poured himself coffee from the ancient pot, grimacing at the taste. ""And interesting enough that Thompson's practically bouncing off the walls.""

""Kid's been here what, three months?"" Mike stood, stretching. ""Everything's interesting to him.""

""Remember when we were like that?"" Jack's smile was tinged with nostalgia. ""Before mining was just about quarterly reports and safety regulations?""

""You mean when we thought we'd discover buried treasure?"" Mike laughed, falling into step beside his old friend as they headed for the elevator. ""Speaking of treasure, Katie made team captain.""

""No kidding?"" Jack's face lit up. He'd been there through Mike's divorce, had watched Katie grow up through photos and video calls. ""That's fantastic. When's her first game?""

""Next Wednesday. You should come. Bring Annie and the boys.""

""Annie'd love that. She's been asking about Katie."" Jack pressed the elevator button. ""You know, if Marcus's discovery pans out, maybe we can finally afford those season tickets we talked about.""

The elevator creaked its way down, the familiar descent giving Mike time to study his friend's face. ""What aren't you telling me about this discovery?""

Jack sighed. ""Marcus found some kind of crystal formations. Unlike anything he's seen before. And Lisa..."" He hesitated. ""Her detector's picking up unusual readings.""

""Dangerous?""

""She says no, but you know Lisa. She tests the air quality when she gets takeout.""

The elevator stopped at level four, where David Thompson was waiting. The young miner's face was flushed with excitement. ""Did you hear? Dr. Rodriguez thinks it could be a new mineral deposit!""

Mike couldn't help smiling at David's enthusiasm. The kid reminded him of his younger self, before twenty years of mining had taught him that most ""discoveries"" turned out to be nothing. Still, David's eagerness was infectious. He'd been a good addition to the team, eager to learn and always first to volunteer for the tough jobs.

They found Marcus Rodriguez and Lisa Blackwood already in the east tunnel, their headlamps illuminating a section of wall where blue crystals peeked through the rock. Marcus was photographing everything, mumbling to himself in Spanish – something he only did when truly excited.

Lisa looked up from her detector, pushing her wire-rimmed glasses up her nose. ""Radiation levels are stable but unusual. I've never seen this particular signature before."" She'd been saying that a lot lately, ever since her husband's cancer diagnosis. Every unexplained reading could be another potential threat, another invisible danger to guard against.

""Look at this crystalline structure,"" Marcus said, not looking up from his camera. ""The formation suggests extreme age, but the luminescence..."" He finally turned to face them, and Mike was struck by the pure joy in the geologist's eyes. Marcus had passed up a cushy university position to work in the field, driven by the same passion for discovery that had made him the first in his family to go to college.

""The lab could analyze it,"" David suggested, already pulling out sample bags. ""My sister works at the university lab. She could fast-track the testing.""

Mike had met David's sister at the mine's Christmas party. The family resemblance was striking – both of them shared the same earnest desire to understand the world's mysteries. She'd spent hours explaining her research to anyone who would listen, while David beamed with obvious pride.

""Hold on,"" Jack said, examining the wall more closely. ""What are these markings?""

They gathered around, headlamps converging on what appeared to be ancient carvings. The symbols were crude but deliberate, forming patterns that sent an inexplicable chill down Mike's spine.

""Indigenous warnings,"" Marcus explained, photographing each symbol. ""Similar to others found in the region, but these are different. The style suggests great age, possibly pre-dating known settlements in the area.""

""Warnings about what?"" Lisa asked, her detector emitting a soft, steady chirp.

Mike ran his fingers over the carvings. In twenty years of mining, he'd seen his share of unusual formations and unexpected discoveries. But something about these symbols, combined with the strange crystals and Lisa's quietly chirping detector, made him uneasy. He thought of Katie's game next week, of the promise he'd made to be there.

""Whatever's behind this wall,"" he said slowly, ""we should call it in. Let corporate handle it.""

Jack looked surprised – Mike was usually the first to push ahead, to seize opportunities before bureaucracy could intervene. But the unease in his gut was growing stronger, and for once, the potential payoff didn't seem worth the risk.

""It could take weeks to get approval,"" Marcus protested. ""If this is what I think it is..."" He gestured at his readings. ""This could be the discovery of the century.""

David was already helping Marcus set up his equipment. Lisa studied her detector with growing concern, while Jack stood back, clearly torn between protocol and curiosity.

Mike thought again of Katie, of college funds and soccer games and all the promises he'd made. One last big discovery, and he could finally step back, take the safer assignments, be there for all the moments he'd been missing.

""Alright,"" he said, pulling out his explosives kit. ""But we do this carefully. Minimal charge, just enough to see what's back there.""

As he began setting up the charges, Mike couldn't shake the feeling that he was making a terrible mistake. But the excitement of discovery was infectious, and the thought of what might lie behind that wall pushed away his doubts.

None of them noticed that the crystals' glow had begun to pulse, ever so slightly, like a sleeping giant's breath.

The explosion was softer than expected, more of a muffled thump than a blast. Mike's expertise showed in how precisely the rock face crumbled, creating an opening just large enough to access whatever lay beyond. Dust swirled in their headlamp beams as the air pressures equalized.

""Temperature drop,"" Lisa reported, checking her instruments. ""At least fifteen degrees cooler in there."" Her detector's steady chirp had increased in frequency, though she kept this observation to herself.

Marcus was already heading for the breach, camera ready. ""The crystal formations are more pronounced. Look at the size of these specimens!"" His voice echoed strangely in the darkness beyond.

David followed close behind, sample bags at the ready. ""Dr. Rodriguez, these ones are actually pulsing. Is that normal?""

Jack caught Mike's eye, and both men recognized their own unease mirrored in each other's face. Years of experience had taught them that anything ""not normal"" in a mine usually meant trouble. But before either could voice their concerns, Marcus's voice rang out again, this time with an edge they'd never heard before.

""My God... Jack! Everyone! You need to see this!""

The chamber beyond the breach was vast, far larger than any natural cave formation should have been at this depth. The crystalline growths they'd seen outside were merely a hint of what awaited them here. Massive blue crystals jutted from the walls and ceiling, their glow providing enough light to see without headlamps. The air felt heavy, almost liquid in their lungs.

Lisa's detector was singing now, its display flashing warnings she'd never seen before. ""These radiation levels... they're not immediately dangerous, but the signature is completely unknown. We should—""

""Look at these artifacts,"" David interrupted, crouching near what appeared to be ancient tools. ""These aren't just prehistoric; they're perfectly preserved. Like they were left here yesterday.""

Marcus was photographing everything, his earlier excitement now tempered with professional focus. ""The preservation is unprecedented. The atmospheric conditions in here, combined with whatever radiation source is present..."" He paused, frowning at his camera's display. ""That's odd. Half my photos aren't recording.""

Mike had wandered toward the far wall, drawn by what looked like more indigenous carvings. These were different from the warnings outside – more elaborate, more urgent. They seemed to tell a story, though the details were just beyond his grasp.

""Jack,"" he called out, his voice tight. ""You need to see these drawings. They look like—""

A sound cut him off. Not a crack or a rumble – the usual noises of a mine settling – but something organic. A deep, slow inhalation, like a giant awakening from a deep sleep.

""Nobody move,"" Jack whispered, his headlamp beam swinging toward a dark alcove they hadn't noticed before. The beam illuminated something that simply couldn't exist.

The bear lay curled in a crystalline nest, its massive form dwarfing any animal they'd ever encountered. Its fur was a dark brown so deep it appeared almost black, absorbing their headlamp beams rather than reflecting them. Most terrifying of all were its dimensions – easily fifteen feet long, with paws the size of car tires.

""Arctodus simus,"" Marcus breathed, his camera forgotten at his side. ""Short-faced bear. The largest predatory land mammal in North American history. But they went extinct over eleven thousand years ago. This is impossible.""

The bear's breathing had changed, becoming less rhythmic. Lisa's detector was screaming now, its display flashing red warnings. ""The radiation levels are spiking. Whatever preserved it... whatever kept it in suspended animation... it's breaking down.""

""We need to leave,"" Jack said, his voice carrying the weight of command. ""Right now. Seal the tunnel behind us and call in every authority we can reach.""

But it was too late. The bear's eyes opened sluggishly, revealing dark maroon irises that seemed to absorb the light from their headlamps. Its massive head lifted slowly, as if fighting against the weight of millennia. Each movement was stiff, uncertain, like machinery being tested after ages of disuse.

The creature gradually rose to its full height, joints crackling like ancient timber, its movements heavy with the fog of its long slumber. For a moment, it seemed almost peaceful – this impossible creature taking its first conscious breaths in thousands of years.

Then its gaze focused, ancient instincts burning through the haze of hibernation. Its lips pulled back, revealing teeth the length of hunting knives, and the chamber exploded into chaos.

Mike's last thought, as the massive creature lunged with impossible speed, was of Katie's soccer game. He'd promised to be there, in the front row. One last broken promise to add to all the others.

The bear's roar shook dust from the ceiling, drowning out the screams that followed.

David slammed the elevator call button repeatedly, each press more desperate than the last. The ground shook beneath their feet as more support beams gave way, decades of careful mining engineering collapsing in the wake of their pursuit. Lisa's radiation detector had stopped chirping entirely, instead emitting a constant high-pitched whine.

""Come on, come on,"" David muttered. His hands shook as he pressed the button again. Behind them, the bear's roars grew closer, accompanied by the sound of rending metal and shattering rock.

Jack pressed himself against the wall next to the elevator doors, trying to steady his ragged breathing. The image of Mike being thrown across the chamber played on repeat in his mind. He'd have to tell Annie why he was coming home alone tonight. Have to explain to Katie why her father wouldn't be at her soccer game.

The elevator dinged.

""It's here!"" David yanked the gates open. ""Quick!""

They piled in, Lisa's hands fumbling with the controls as Jack pulled the gates shut. The bear's massive form appeared at the end of the corridor just as the elevator began to rise, its maroon eyes gleaming in the emergency lights. Something was different about its shape now – the proportions seemed wrong, its shoulders broader, its limbs somehow longer.

The creature charged.

""Faster,"" David pleaded, though they all knew the elevator could only move at one speed. ""Please, faster.""

The bear reached them just as they cleared its reach. Massive claws raked the bottom of the elevator cage, the screech of torn metal drowning out their panicked breathing. The whole elevator shuddered, but continued its ascent.

""Look,"" Lisa whispered, pointing through the gates.

Below them, the bear had reared up on its hind legs, its full height now truly visible. Its fur had taken on a metallic sheen where the radiation had changed it, and its muscles rippled with unnatural power. But most terrifying was its face – the almost-black fur had receded around its eyes, revealing patches of armored hide beneath. The bear opened its mouth and roared up at them, revealing teeth that had grown even longer, more savage.

Then it turned and loped away into the darkness.

""Where's it going?"" David asked, his voice cracking.

""The main shaft,"" Jack said. His mining knowledge painted a terrible picture. ""It's heading for the surface road.""

Lisa's detector was still screaming. She studied its display with horror. ""The radiation levels in its body... they're still climbing. And these readings..."" She looked up at them, face pale. ""It's not just growing.”

The elevator seemed to take an eternity to reach the surface. Each second that passed was torture, knowing what was racing through the tunnels below them. Jack found himself counting the floors. Four... three... two...

They burst into late afternoon sunlight. The mine's surface facility was quiet – the day shift had ended, and night shift wouldn't start for hours. Perfect timing for a nightmare to emerge.

A distant crash echoed from the main shaft entrance, followed by the sound of twisting metal. They ran toward the mine office, toward the phones that could warn someone, anyone, about what was coming. Behind them, the noises grew louder.

The bear exploded from the mine entrance, sending the heavy steel doors flying like paper. It emerged into natural light for the first time in eleven thousand years, its massive form casting a long shadow in the setting sun. For a moment it stood motionless, maroon eyes taking in the modern world.

Then something began to happen.

The bear's body convulsed, its muscles rippling beneath fur that was now more metal than hair. Its skeleton cracked and reformed, growing larger by the second. The armored plates around its eyes spread, covering more of its face and neck. Its claws lengthened and curved, taking on the same metallic sheen as its fur. Most terrifying of all was its size – it was now easily twice as large as it had been in the cave.

""My God,"" Lisa breathed, her detector's screams reaching a new pitch. ""The atmospheric exposure... it's accelerating the mutations.""

The bear raised its head and roared. The sound was like nothing on Earth – part animal fury, part metallic screech. Windows shattered across the mining complex. And in the distance, they could hear another sound the evening traffic from Pine Ridge, just five miles down the mountain.

They had just unleashed something ancient and terrible into the modern world. And it was still changing.

* Are dedicated thermometers accurate (and respond quickly) when used with a dumb kettle?

Most of the time I’m fine but every now and then… it just wears me down… 

My husband and I’s sleep “needs”? Couldn’t be more different. My husband falls asleep fast and sleeps deep while I take atleast an hour to fall asleep and I don’t sleep well which has lead to a situation where my husband gets his sleep needs met and I just can’t. My husband doesn’t want to go to bed until it’s fairly late and he is rested and ready to go for the day often before our daughter even gets up for the day. This means that on weekdays my husband has to get up early for work while I get up early to get our daughter going for the day and on the weekend my husband gets to sleep in and still be up to get our daughter up which means I can try and sleep in but it NEVER HAPPENS!!

There is always a reason I’m woken up plus my husband wants to stay up even later on the weekends so instead of getting a little extra sleep I actually lose more sleep on the weekends. I can’t go to bed without him as there’s no point I’m not going to be asleep asleep before he’s ready to crawl into bed which.. it’s like a god dang earthquake when he gets into bed. As for the morning I don’t know I just have really bad luck there are times my husband can get out of bed without waking me or only barely waking me but there is always something stupid that wakes me up anyway like our cat.. we have a black cat.. my husband does his best to make sure she’s not in the room but sometimes she’s missed and wakes me up to get out of the room.. but usually it’s my husband who wakes me up.. not being able to find his phone or tripping on something or stubbing his toe or forgetting his coffee press on his work desk that in our room.. but sometimes it’s just uncanny things like a bird getting into the vent by our room wake me up.. the neighbours dropping something wind slamming the neighbours gate even morning fireworks. 

I know I shouldn’t be expecting to sleep in because it’s not happened even once in the last year but I still unfortunately get a little bit excited that maybe this time I’ll get to sleep in and everytime for some dumb reason it doesn’t happen I get the tiniest bit disappointed and it wears me down a little at a time until I feel like I’m going to snap ",0,1738434686.0,Advice,3,0.5,False

I just moved to a big city for graduate school, am married, and am trying to make new friends. My partner is an introvert who works from home, so I am the one who is kind of taking the initiative about meeting new people. The new ""friends"" I have made are all in their mid 20s, single or in long distance. Not many other guys around.

 I am the one in this friend group who seems to initiate trying new things. For example, I invite people for coffee near my neighborhood or to go to a Sunday roast in my area, its the only place we will all go without any other input or trying somewhere new. Yesterday one of the girls in the groupchat asked what we were doing this weekend. I said I am thinking of trying out a cafe in the Highgate woods area and will frolic around afterwards, and that everyone is welcome to come. I spent the day out with my husband and it was lovely, only to find that the other girls went to the Highgate are (through social media), and didn't invite me. Now I understand that I do not own them, nor do I have claim to an area, but it still stings that it feels like my plans were taken up, and I wasn't even invited. It hurts.



This is not the first time this has happened to me, which makes me ask...why? Am I too available? Do they feel weird about my partner being there (he is my best friend and he is still working on meeting people closer to our age than just hanging around 20-something year old gen-z girls), is it me?

33 y/o guy with a cute smile (have been told so) with a career in tech ( but not a tech bro ), a calm presence with a life that has been a wild adventure of extremes, I thrive on intellectual chaos. I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history,  particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot but i am 

**What I’m Looking For:**  
A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

**The Vibe:**  
Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.

I'm struggling to dial in the settings even after reading the advice here.  I'm coming from a Nespresso Original Line DeLonghi Latissima Plus which I've had for 12 years and makes a consistently great coffee with excellent milk foam.  In December, I decided I wanted take my home coffee to the next level with a fresh ground bean to cup machine and after research (including a lot of rave reviews on this forum) ended up with the KF8 also do to the great Inside Pass deal.

I can't seem to get consistently good coffee from this machine.  I prefer mostly milk drinks and the occasional black espresso.  I've tried Stumptown Homestead and Intelligentsia Black Cat Espresso beans, and two I found on sale at HomeGoods, Dallmayr and Saquella Grand Gusto.  Ironically I prefer the cheapest beans, the Saquella, I think because it's a darker roast (not oily) which holds up better to the milk drinks.  I've adjusted the grind size and found that the second most coarse setting (2 from the right or the back depending on how you look at it) to be the best.  I tried whole, 2% and nonfat milk and was getting inconsistent foam - nonfat is the only one that foams every time.  Someone posted on here that the Latte Macchiato drink makes good foam and so I'm mostly using that for milk based drinks.  In the past two days now the milk also tastes sour (milk is fresh).  I read that too high temp can make it taste sour, so I will next reduce temp to Medium and see if that helps.

On the positive side, as everyone has reported on here, the machine is really well designed and made and the UI and prompts are clear and easy to follow.  The side mounted water tank is very convenient (especially since it goes through water extremely fast) and the removable bean hopper and purge functions are helpful while sampling these different coffees.  The one thing I cannot understand is the milk container - it's way too large and I hate that the lid does not click in.  The Nespresso milk lid securely locks into the clear container.

Open to any advice or thoughts.  I was so upset this week that I did reach out to Inside Pass and explained my experience and they surprisingly offered to take it back even though I used it.  I will play around a little more this weekend, but if I can't get it right, I may just return it.",3,1738434231.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False

For starters, there was Wound Seal. I've seen it in use, and it works. My question is if it's safe, sterile, medically sound, or if there's a better alternative that fills the same role?

Second, he had little patches of mentholated alcohol that he said were good to put on burns, and had a (very unrealistic) anecdote about how this product supposedly stopped a 3rd degree burn from dealing permanent internal damage. Something about how a child got boiling water poured on them, and was still cooking internally and doctors wouldn't do anything at all until it stopped burning. To my knowledge, putting alcohol of any kind on a burn is a really bad idea, but I wanted some insight into something I've never heard of before.

Third, he had a thing of ground up coffee beans and dried lemon zest that he said helps people with headaches when they snort it. This one... Seems probably the least far fetched. But I wanted to see if there's anything legitimate about it, just in case.

TYIA, I can say that the company safety manager has already begun looking for a different company to have do our first aid and CPR trainings in the future, because he agrees that the entire thing was very, very sketchy.

1ifcljw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1ifcljw/does_athome_teeth_whitening_actually_work/,Does At-Home Teeth Whitening Actually Work?,"Teeth whitening has always been one of those things I wanted to try but never fully committed to. I drink a lot of coffee and tea, so over the years, my teeth started looking dull and stained. I tried whitening strips, but they left my teeth feeling sensitive. Whitening toothpaste never really made a difference. And going to the dentist for professional whitening? Way too expensive.

That’s when I started looking into **Laughland teeth whitening**. I’d seen people talk about it online, and what caught my attention was that it’s a **dentist-formulated gel** paired with an **LED light**—a combo that supposedly helps lift stains faster than regular at-home methods. I figured I’d give it a shot and see if it actually works.

# What Comes in the Laughland Whitening Kit?

When I opened the box, everything looked pretty sleek and simple. Here’s what was inside:

1. **Whitening Gel Pens** – These are easy to use and let you apply the gel evenly across your teeth.
2. **LED Mouthpiece** – This helps activate the whitening gel for better, faster results.
3. **Clear Instructions** – The step-by-step guide makes the process super simple.

I liked that there weren’t a million things to figure out—just a straightforward process that didn’t feel overwhelming.

# How to Use Laughland Teeth Whitening

Each session takes **only 10 minutes**, which is great if you don’t want to spend forever on a whitening routine. Here’s what I did:

1. **Brush and Dry Your Teeth** – The instructions say dry teeth work best, so I made sure to pat mine dry before applying the gel.
2. **Apply the Gel** – The pen applicator makes this super easy. You just twist the pen and brush the gel onto your teeth.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece** – Pop it in, turn on the light, and let it do its thing for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse and Clean** – Once the time’s up, rinse your mouth and clean the device.

The mouthpiece felt comfortable, and I liked that I could just chill and watch Netflix while whitening my teeth.

# What Happened Over Six Days?

* **Day 1:** No big changes, but my teeth felt really clean after the first session.
* **Day 3:** I noticed some of my coffee stains starting to fade, especially near the edges of my teeth.
* **Day 6:** By the last session, my teeth were **visibly whiter—about 6–7 shades lighter**. The results were even, and my teeth looked natural—not overly white or artificial.

What really surprised me? **No sensitivity.** Whitening strips always left me cringing whenever I drank cold water, but I didn’t have that issue at all with Laughland.

# What Makes Laughland Different?

After trying multiple whitening products before, here’s why Laughland stood out:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel** – It’s designed to lift stains without harming enamel, which is a big deal if you have sensitive teeth.
2. **LED Light Activation** – The light speeds up the whitening process and helps the gel penetrate deeper into the enamel.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients** – The gel is stored in a temperature-controlled facility, so it doesn’t lose its effectiveness over time.

**Curious if it works for you? Check it out** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# How Does It Compare to Other Whitening Products?

* **Whitening Strips** – They work, but they always left my teeth feeling super sensitive, and the results were uneven.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** – Great for maintenance but doesn’t do much for deep stains.
* **Professional Whitening** – Definitely works, but the cost ($500+) and sensitivity issues made it a no-go for me.

Laughland felt like a **solid middle ground**—affordable, effective, and no pain.

# Common Questions About Laughland Teeth Whitening

1. **Is it safe for enamel?** – Yes, the formula is designed to remove stains without damaging enamel.
2. **Does it work on old stains?** – Yep! My coffee stains had been there for years, and I still saw a difference.
3. **How long do results last?** – That depends on your habits. Avoiding coffee, tea, and red wine will help maintain the results longer.

# Tips for Better Results

1. **Stick to the Routine** – Use it every day for six days straight.
2. **Limit Staining Foods** – Cut back on coffee, tea, and red wine during the whitening process.
3. **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene** – Brushing and flossing will keep your teeth looking bright for longer.

**Thinking about trying it? You can check it out** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# Final Thoughts: Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening** did exactly what it promised. It was easy to use, fit into my routine, and most importantly, didn’t leave me with painful sensitivity. My teeth looked noticeably brighter in just six days, and I felt way more confident in my smile.

If you’re looking for a whitening option that actually delivers results without breaking the bank, **this one’s worth considering**.

I noticed that just about everybody has a lot of drinks in their fridge- juices, sodas, Gatorade, etc. I was kinda surprised because I realized I almost never have any type of drink in my fridge. It’s just not something I ever even think to get.

When I’m thirsty, I drink water. I’ve always loved water since I was a child, and even if I have other drinks it won’t quench my thirst- I still need water or I’m not satisfied. So maybe that’s why I don’t crave other liquids? Or maybe it’s just never been a part of my lifestyle…we rarely had sodas or juices at home unless we were having company. I guess my parents didn’t care for drinks either.

It’s not a conscious health decision either. If I go to someone’s house and they offer me a soda I’ll have one and usually I’m like “damn, this is good,” but it’s not something I ever feel the need to have at home at all times. Same with juice and other drinks.

I have a cup of coffee in the morning, and occasionally a glass of wine with dinner. But that’s pretty much it for liquids other than water.

You know those days where everything feels heavy for no ""big"" reason? I was sitting in a coffee shop, staring at my lukewarm latte, trying not to let my face betray the chaos in my head. Bills, loneliness, the guilt of not calling my mom… just *life*, y’know?  

Out of nowhere, an older woman slid into the seat across from me. She didn’t ask if I was okay—she just handed me a napkin and said, *""I’ve been there. It gets lighter, I promise.""* Then she left. No name, no advice, just… a napkin and six words.  

I ugly-cried right there. Not because I was sad, but because someone *saw me*. Not the version I post online, not the ""I’m fine"" mask—*me*.  

I don’t know her name, but that napkin’s now taped to my bathroom mirror. It reminds me that even when I feel invisible, kindness doesn’t need a reason. ",135,1738433575.0,self,17,0.96,False

1ifcdwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ifcdwr/caffeine_has_a_psychostimulant_action_even_in/,Caffeine has a psychostimulant action even in extremely low doses - study,"This is a double-blind study that looked at the psychostimulant effects of ""low"" doses of caffeine and discovered that even the lowest dose used - 12.5 mg - had basically the same effect as 100 mg. This turns the mainstream belief about caffeine on it's head that considers only doses of 100-400mg really powerful.

Since the study did not look at doses below 12.5 mg, it is highly likely that a lower dose - for example 6 mg - would have had the same psychostimulant action. 12.5 mg caffeine in this study significantly speeded up reaction time.

[Reaction time compared to placebo](https://preview.redd.it/7b47jc55mkge1.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=094f7c30cc3326fe0c65b67351a723c65a79874b)

This explains why some people notice effects from decaf coffee. The caffeine content of a regular cup of decaf coffee can range between 0.5 and 10 mg.

According to [healthline.com](http://healthline.com)

>One study analyzed 16-ounce (473-ml) cups of drip-brewed decaf coffee from nine US chains or local coffee houses. All but one contained 8.6–13.9 mg caffeine, with an average of 9.4 mg.

There are only few decaf coffee products that specify the amount of caffeine that's still left. The best decaf has merely <0.01% of caffeine relative to total weight, which corresponds to around 0.5 - 1 mg of caffeine per cup. This is only possible with the CO2-process of decaffeination (and maybe with Swiss Water). The longer the CO2 works on the beans, the lower the caffeine content.

>Caffeine is present in many widely consumed drinks and some foods. In the fairly extensive literature on the psychostimulant effects of caffeine, there are few dose-response studies and even fewer studies of the effects of doses of caffeine lower than 50 mg (the range of the amounts of caffeine contained in, for example, a typical serving of tea or cola).

>This study measured the effects of 0, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mg caffeine on cognitive performance, mood and thirst in adults with low and moderate to high habitual caffeine intakes.

>Effects on performance and mood confirmed a psychostimulant action of caffeine. All doses of caffeine significantly affected cognitive performance, and the dose-response relationships for these effects were rather flat.

>After overnight caffeine abstinence, caffeine can significantly affect cognitive performance, mood and thirst at doses within and even lower than the range of amounts of caffeine contained in a single serving of popular caffeine-containing drinks.

People are so numbed by large doses of caffeine these days that they do not realize that they are chronically overdosing a neurotoxin that acts as a central nervous system stimulant. Even decaf coffee will lead to dependence if not using a brand that only has <1 mg of caffeine per cup.

It is highly likely that even a dose of 5 mg is psychotropically active, and we do not know yet what the lowest effective dose is.",17,1738433465.0,decaf,3,0.96,False
1ifcdvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1ifcdvm/tifu_becoming_a_human_whoopee_cushion_in_the/,TIFU: Becoming a human whoopee cushion in the worst possible moment,"Throw away account for reasons.

There are moments in a man’s life when he stands at the precipice of greatness, trembling, heart pounding, sensing that the universe has opened a door for him. A door he must walk through. This was one of those moments.

It began, as many things do, with a blowjob. A masterpiece in progress, her hands and lips moving with the kind of focus Michelangelo must have had while sculpting David. But then, she pulled back, met my eyes with a twinkle that promised something new, something forbidden. 

“I wanna eat your ass.”

Now friends, I am not a proud man, but I am a man who understands gravity. This was an honor, a privilege, a once-in-a-lifetime event that I knew could either cement my place as a god among men or utterly destroy me. 

But there was a problem.

You see, I had spent the day indulging in a reckless combination of black coffee, eggs, and a burrito the size of a small child. A diet of hubris. A meal designed for men who fear neither death nor consequence. 

I hesitated. She misinterpreted. 

“Don’t be shy”

Oh, but I was not shy. I was terrified. I was a man standing on the edge of a chasm, staring down into the abyss, knowing full well that the abyss was about to stare back.

And so, she done in. 

Dear god.

The second her tongue made contact, my body betrayed me. A deep, guttural rumble from the depths of hell itself. A tectonic shift. An unstoppable force meeting an unfortunate face.

I farted. 

Not a cute, dismissible puff of air mind you. No. This was the Exxon Valdez of farts. A biological weapon. A sound like a balloon deflating in slow agony. 

She recoiled as if she’s been shot. Eyes wide, mouth… well, open. 

“Dude”

And just like that, the moment was gone. The universe slammed the door shut, locked it, and threw away the key. 

She left the room as I lay there, a man ruined, staring at the ceiling, reflecting on the choices that had led me to this moment. 

TL;DR: I let my girlfriend eat my ass, but my digestive system had other plans. ",36,1738433463.0,tifu,8,0.77,False
