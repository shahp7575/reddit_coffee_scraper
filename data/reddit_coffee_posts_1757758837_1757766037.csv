1nfw1ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1nfw1ua/wibta_if_i_asked_my_husband_to_stop_his/,WIBTA if I asked my husband to stop his woodworking hobby?,"I (35F) am married to my husband (42M) and this whole situation is driving me absolutely nuts but I genuinely don't know if I'm being unreasonable here.

Before COVID hit, we were both office workers, commuting every day. Now I work from home because we had a baby and childcare is insane.

When the pandemic started, my husband went through the whole classic COVID phase that literally everyone did sourdough starter etc but while most people moved on, he got REALLY into woodworking and just... never stopped. Like, this became his whole personality.

I feel like such an asshole even typing this but he is just NOT good at it. Like, at all. I'm talking comically bad. But he doesn't seem to realize this and keeps building stuff for our house.

Our dining table literally rocks back and forth when you put a coffee cup on it. I have to wedge things under one of the legs just to eat dinner without getting frustrated. The kitchen shelves he built are so uneven that everything on them slowly migrates to one side throughout the day. I'll put my mug on the counter in the morning and by afternoon it's somehow traveled three inches to the right because the whole thing is sloped.

The worst part is the baby stuff. He built this changing station that I swear feels like it's going to collapse every time I use it. The whole thing wobbles when I put the baby on it and one of the corners doesn't even touch the ground properly. I've started just changing the baby on our bed because I'm genuinely scared the thing is going to tip over but when he catches me doing it he always asks why i'm not using what he built He also made this bookshelf for the nursery that's so crooked it looks like that BBQ from the Simpsons episode.

I've tried to be supportive because I know he really enjoys it and it gives him something to do after work. He gets so excited showing me his latest project and explaining all the techniques he used. He watches YouTube videos constantly and has filled our garage with tools. I don't want to be the dream-crusher

But living like this is making me insane. I just want to be able to put a book on a shelf and have it stay there. I want to eat dinner without having to stabilize the table first. I want baby furniture that doesn't make me nervous.

The final straw was last week when he finished this ""entertainment center"" contraption for our living room. It's supposed to hold our TV and PS4, but it's so wonky that I'm afraid our TV is going to fall off backwards and break. Plus it looks like he measured wrong because there's this weird gap on one side and the doors don't close properly.

I keep hinting that maybe we could buy some furniture instead, or suggesting we look at stores together, but he always says something like ""why would we buy something when I can just make it?"" And then he launches into this explanation of his next project like a golden retriever.

I want to ask him to stop building furniture for our house but I feel terrible because I know how much this hobby means to him and how proud he is of his work.

So WIBTA if I told him I don't want any more of his woodworking projects in our house? Am I being too critical? How do I move forward because I feel like i'm about to go crazy.

Speaking on Komal Nahta‚Äôs YouTube show Game Changers, Aamir Khan said, ""The producer should only spend as much as the film requires. Pay the make-up man, hairdresser, costume person, that‚Äôs all part of the film. But why would the producer pay for my boy or my driver? They are working for me.‚Äù

The actor explained that earlier in the industry, producers would cover expenses for a star‚Äôs driver or spot boy. But he questioned this practice and chose to handle it himself. ‚ÄúI am a very independent man. I don‚Äôt want producers paying my staff. Does this mean the producer will also pay for my kid‚Äôs school? Where does it stop?‚Äù he asked.

Khan said he was shocked to hear about the present-day demands of some actors. ‚ÄúProducers now pay an actor‚Äôs driver‚Äôs monthly salary, the boy who brings tea and coffee, even personal cooks. Some stars bring a cooking van and a gym van on set - and the producer pays for that too. When a star earns in crores, can‚Äôt he pay his own staff? Every star‚Äôs priority should be not to burden the film. That is called being a team player""

While criticising unnecessary demands, Aamir Khan clarified that producers should cover costs directly related to the film‚Äôs production. He gave his own example: ‚ÄúWhen I did a film on wrestling, the training was provided by the producer"".

Khan also shared how he manages his family expenses during outdoor shoots. ‚ÄúEven when I take my family on outdoor shoots, not once have I made the producer pay for it. I put in the extra money myself. Today, stars are taking advantage of being stars. I find this very odd. It‚Äôs a shame that even today there are actors who are being very unfair to their producers and films.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs my reality: I have the 4:30 AM, 8 AM, 11 Am and 9PM breast feeding shifts and I also pump milk so my husband can bottle feed in the evenings 
I‚Äôm up at 4:30‚Äì5:00 am to feed, burp, and change the baby ‚Äî there goes an hour. 
I finally think I can crawl back into bed‚Ä¶ but now my boobs are so engorged I have to pump. And next thing I know it‚Äôs 7:30 AM some how. 

By the time I finish pumping and cleaning up, it‚Äôs basically morning. At that point, ‚Äúrest‚Äù isn‚Äôt really an option ‚Äî my body won‚Äôt let me cause now I‚Äôm wide awake.. so I go to the kitchen to make coffee and prep more breast milk for my baby. And my MIL offers to help , which I love.. don‚Äôt get me wrong but she always says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the baby so you can go rest.‚Äù I get that but it‚Äôs like 8 AM.. and I‚Äôm wide awake. So at this point, I might as well continue with what I am doing with the baby.. and you can take the baby around 2 PN when my body actually wants to go to sleep lol 


I don‚Äôt think people realize that for breastfeeding moms, sleep isn‚Äôt a choice. Engorgement is uncomfortable (and sometimes painful), and if you don‚Äôt pump, you risk clogged ducts or worse. My boobs hurt like hell in the morning.. and sometimes at like 2 AM.. and I have to get up to pump or breastfeed to relieve the pain. 

So when someone tells me ‚Äújust get some rest,‚Äù I smile politely ‚Äî but inside I‚Äôm like: ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll get right on that once my body stops acting like a 24/7 milk factory.‚Äù ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

My husband ordered a pizza, and I ate one slice of pizza and some cucumber salad for dinner. Normally I would eat like 3 pieces of pizza. I did my regular 1 mile hike, had some mild side effects (weird taste in my mouth, drank a bunch of sparkling water and it went away). Later, I ate 5 crackers and one wedge of that laughing cow cheese as my pre-bed snack. 

This morning, I had my regular coffee with half & half and I am just not hungry at all. I eventually made a protein shake to get something in my system. 

Questions:

1. Is this what it's like all the time, you are just not hungry? Or does that wear off during the week, or as you keep on the sema over a longer period of time? 
2. Also, I have absolutely no motivation to make any sort of meal plan for the week or do the grocery shopping, which is what I usually do on Friday Nights/ Saturday Mornings. 
3. Do you get more or less side effects depending on what you eat or how much you eat? I'm a little worried I will start feeling worse if I don't eat enough, given how I am feeling.

Found that 500-1000mg magnesium malate combined with a b complex (had to be both) drastically reduced (if not eliminated) all symptoms. 

Been pumping those supplements with daily 16-32 oz of green tea. For about 2 weeks.

Can now drink litres green tea per day with no symptoms. 
Can now drink Dr pepper with no symptoms.

Don't even need to take supplements daily anymore.

Symptoms in my 20s felt like low blood sugar or low blood pressure. Severe weakness/fatigue, got pale, breathing felt difficult, etc. When I started this experiment, symptoms were more just like head pressure, muscle soreness (like I got punched or lifted heavy), and fatigue.

Can now enjoy mildly caffeinated beverages again :)

1nfvma3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nfvma3,Darker skin/redness around lost hair follicles. No itching.,"I‚Äôve been losing hair for about 8 years. I never noticed any redness on my scalp because I used to comb over to cover the bald spots. Recently I shaved my head and saw the difference in color.

Dermatologist told me the redness on my scalp is from drinking milk, without running any blood tests. (I had a general blood test done yesterday though and everything came back normal.). She also diagnosed me with androgenic alopecia.

Could their be an underlying issue that‚Äôs causing both the redness and the hair loss? Or is the redness from drinking 400 ml milk (coffee) daily?

1nfvlkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nfvlkp/today_you_tomorrow_me/,"Today you, Tomorrow me","My grandmother always taught me to see the good in things. I always¬†see people for the things they‚Äôve gone through, always see animals as people too unless I was in a dire moment of survival, always turn the other cheek, etc, etc‚Ä¶.

Growing up I would never even think of hurting someone. I grew up shy, and timid; whenever moments called for conflict, I‚Äôd always do my best to steer away from the situation entirely.¬†

However, as time went on and years passed‚Ä¶I came to the realization that people were not to be looked at as the things they had gone through. The things people have gone through are what mold them into the people they are today. Look at Kim Jong Un; do you think that if the Kim family had been born in the United States they‚Äôd still have the same views that they have today? It‚Äôs all about the people who teach you, and the environments that you grow up in.

Unfortunately for me, the love that once flowed through the veins of my family like the very blood that binds us together very gradually became clotted with sticky dark clumps of black tar heroin. Poverty tore the family that I loved apart; and with poverty‚Ä¶ comes a want to escape, and very quickly can that want become a need.

Unluckily for us, minds can easily be broken and discouraged. So once that want for escape became a need in my family, minds were broken beyond repair. And so what did my loved ones turn to? The hardest drugs, and the strongest alcohol they could get their hands on.

I, being the innocent, loving, little 8-year-old that I was, could only love these people so much before my mind, too, began to break. For years I watched the people that I cared the most about tear each other apart in order to get the money for their next hit, And for years my heart grew colder and colder with each passing winter of watching my family struggle on Christmas.¬†

Finally, on my 16th Christmas, my mind had finally snapped‚Ä¶

My mother had set the table in our tiny little home in a way that made my shack of a house feel like a mansion. The ham had been cooked to perfection on our run-down oven/heating system; and the sides of mashed potatoes, corn, and green bean casserole smelled absolutely delectable. The Christmas tree stood as decorated as a 5-star general in the front window of our quaint home, and from the outside looking in I‚Äôm sure we looked like a symbol of hope for a better life in our house that my mother worked so hard to make a home.

It looked‚Ä¶nice‚Ä¶And it felt nice too. Through all the hardships faced in my family, my mother had stood strong and did everything she possibly could in order to support me and my brother. Put a roof over our heads and made sure that we had a delicious dinner every Thanksgiving and Christmas.¬†Everything was quiet and calm, and meditative, and me, my brother, and my mother felt‚Ä¶relaxed.

All of a sudden my drugged-out-of-his-mind father came falling through the front door, cutting the silence like a sword to a single thread of silk. He was off his rocker spewing nonsense about being invisible, and how he could feel the bugs in his brain, and blah blah blah.

We‚Äôd heard it all a thousand times before and all we wanted was to have a decent Christmas. My mother couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore so she snapped, screaming at the top of her lungs about how much of an awful man he was, how awful of a father he was, and how half-assed his apologies and love felt.¬†

I‚Äôd heard this conversation too, a thousand times, so I was pretty desensitized to the whole thing at this point which made what happened next all the more shocking.¬†

My father had silenced my mother‚Äôs screams by punching her so hard she fell into our tree and completely crushed all of the gifts underneath‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd seen my father push my mother, or even shove my mother full force for that matter. But never had I seen him punch my mother‚Ä¶

I was distraught. My mother was on the ground still. She had been struck pretty hard so she was moving but she wasn‚Äôt getting up. My brother had run to his room crying in fear of my father and my father himself was still in his drug-enforced rage;¬†trashing the living room and going on and on about, ‚ÄúLOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO!!‚Äù and, ‚ÄúI HATE WHEN YOU MAKE ME DO THIS!!‚Äù¬†

Enough was enough.

I‚Äôd watched my mother cry too many tears, and I‚Äôd felt too much pain myself. I grabbed the knife that had been used to carve my mother‚Äôs ham, walked past her lying broken on the ground, grabbed my father by what remained of the hair on top of his head, and let the serrated teeth of the blade chew through his adam‚Äôs apple as if the steel were a junky looking for his next hit within my dad‚Äôs throat.¬†¬†

My mother was too battered to notice until the once noise-filled room fell silent. She looked up at me; horrified and quivering. Blood stained the window in front of me and my father‚Äôs dripping corpse lay on the floor, still bleeding out of the wound I‚Äôd created.

The fear I saw in my mother‚Äôs eyes exceeded the fear she had when my father punched her. It exceeded the fear she had in her eyes when her own brother shot at her during a separate rampage. The fear my mother was exhibiting exceeded any fear that I had ever seen painted on her face‚Ä¶ and I couldn‚Äôt do it.¬†

I ran as fast as I could out of my house. I immediately made my way into the woods because, of course, I did just kill a man. And when I heard the screeching of police sirens, I made my way deeper into those woods. The state of my mother and the house must‚Äôve been enough to cause commotion at the station because WOW it sounded like every cop in the town was headed my way.

I mean when a full-grown man punches and knocks your mother into a crumpled mess on top of the Christmas tree‚Ä¶surely they‚Äôd be able to show some compassion for a kid in that circumstance, even if the following circumstance was even more horrid.

Anyway, I walked‚Ä¶and walked‚Ä¶and walked in these woods until I was certain that I was far away from home.¬†

Now when I say far away from home I don‚Äôt mean I made it two or three states away, no, I made it about three or four cities away at the very most. I had to cross over some main streets and populated areas in between my ducks off into the woods but I made it somewhere where it was very unlikely I would be recognized straight away by people. That being said I had to be extremely careful when it came to my decision-making and planning.¬†

I had to get up off the ground somehow. I was still moderately close to my home and wanted for murder so; I decided I was going to get the essentials I needed with the small 500 dollars in savings that I‚Äôd managed to muster up from my part-time work at PetSmart, then I was going to make my way further across the country.¬†

I bought about 15 dollars worth of ramen, 15 on Chef Boyardee, purchased a 15 pack of socks for 20 dollars, went to a Goodwill and spent 100 on shirts and bottoms, then decided to keep what I had left and use it along the way to wherever it was I was headed. I was down to 237 dollars and 56 cents.

I used 190 dollars of what remained and got myself a bus ticket that went from Atlanta to Aspen. A 42-hour trip that I was going to have to spend thinking about every decision I‚Äôd made that had led me exactly to where I was at this point in my life.¬†¬†

I thought hard about life. My grandmother‚Äôs want to always do good had rubbed off on me, but the school of life had scrubbed me clean of those preachings.¬†

Money makes this world go round and the only thing that holds a man back from having nothing is having a family to be there for him and my family was lost about 2 days ago. On top of that, my pockets were completely empty aside from what remained of the savings that I had almost completely blown through trying to get to where I was. I had to find a way to make my money, stay as well hidden as possible, get a roof over my head, and somehow find a way to get as far away from my current identity as possible.

All of these thoughts were circulating through my mind as I rode along and made my way towards the mountains.¬†

Everything on the bus ride had been going pretty much perfectly; well, as perfectly as a several-state bus ride could go but‚ÄîWe‚Äôd stopped multiple times at rest stops for the other passengers to get snacks and relieve themselves, I myself only went when I felt it absolutely necessary.¬†

However, something had gone terribly wrong once we entered the Arkansas highway system.¬†Now‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how much you know about Arkansas, but their roads are absolute garbage.

Even before things had gone downhill, my head was banging and slanging back and forth from the bumps and potholes in the road. About an hour and a half after crossing over into the land of opportunity, the bus very opportunistically bounced over a massive pothole directly in the middle of U.S. 278. The Greyhound began screeching and rumbling on its left side, followed by the rhythmic fwump, fwump, fwump of the rear left tire.¬†

‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶‚Äù I thought to myself as we veered over to the side of the road. I knew that a bus on the side of the road breaking down was definitely going to force any passing cop to pull over alongside us; even if it was just to make sure everything was in order. I knew that the officer, or officers for that matter, would also more than likely come aboard the bus to check on the wellbeing of the passengers and I really, really could not risk any person with a badge even so much as spotting me.¬†

So as the bus came to a stop, before the driver could even begin to address the passengers, I faked a severe case of motion sickness and powered my way off the bus. I even began throwing up by thinking about what I‚Äôd done and about my current situation‚Ä¶ I think I sold it pretty well but who knows.

I ended up telling the driver that I was gonna make a call and as he was announcing what the next course of action was to the rest of the passengers, I made my way further and further off the main road pretending to be talking to someone with my hand pressed to my face; hoping no one would notice my lack of phone.

Seeing as how this was an interstate highway and not just some small town back road, I didn‚Äôt have much of an option when it came to hiding myself‚Ä¶

I mean there was a little section of woods that I could sort of use to get out of the way of the thousands of passing cars; but past that, I was quite literally walking through people‚Äôs backyards.¬†

Now I have at least some sense left in me at this point, I‚Äôm being extra precautious about where I step because now I‚Äôm actively trespassing and if some sketched-out woman, home with her kids, sees me walking through their yard; then I‚Äôm one hundred percent getting the cops called on me‚Äîand then once that happens, I knew my description would match the description of the murderer of my father back home, and the police would swarm my area.¬†

After making it about 10 miles or so from where I departed my bus I finally found some more forest to hide in. I walked and walked again only this time I didn‚Äôt have to walk nearly as far because thanks to some miracle of God I found a town that was perfect to hide out in until I regained my bearings. It wasn‚Äôt too small to where if there was absolutely any suspicion‚Äîthe whole population would know within an hour, but it also wasn‚Äôt so big that I‚Äôd have to worry about recognition.¬†

I cautiously made my way into the town and found a park with a pavilion. Around this point, it was getting dark out, so I figured I‚Äôd just hang out in the park until the sun went down then I‚Äôd take shelter underneath the pavilion for the night. Which is exactly what I did, I sat on the swings just contemplating everything until the light faded.

Then I made my way back to my home for the night and laid down on the bench trying to get some sleep. The next morning when I awoke it was rainy and misty. Everything was so muggy and it seriously made me not even want to try for the day and instead just hang out in solace or something. But alas, I left the park and started making my way around the town in search of work.¬†

I had to do something‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt just keep ducking off in the woods and hiding in parks. So the conscious decision was made to look for low-key employment. To make a long story short I found a newspaper ad for a guy who wanted help cleaning out his attic. It was just a one-time job and he was paying 100 for the day so what the hell, right?

I helped the old guy out and collected my payment which gave me enough money to pay for a hotel for the night. But guess what? That fucking hotel stay put me right back down to where I was a-fucking-gain and this time there was no newspaper ad to get me another night‚Äôs stay.¬†

This shit was getting ridiculous and I wasn‚Äôt about to stay in the situation I was in‚ÄîI had made it this far without a hitch in the nonexistent plan so all I really needed to do was keep stepping until I eventually landed on solid ground.¬†

My grandmother and her teachings were dead. The me that had existed prior to all of this was dead. I wasn‚Äôt going to continue being this helpless, scared little child. I had just traveled halfway across the country, by myself. I had hidden away from law enforcement, by myself. I got justice for my mother and brother and had ended a cancer that was eating away at my family, by myself.

Oh no, I wasn‚Äôt about to give up when I had made it this far.

This world was, and still is, sick; only back then‚ÄîI had no intention of being a part of the world‚Äôs cruel game anymore‚Ä¶¬†

I remembered the addiction that tortured my family. I remembered the poverty that tortured my family. I remembered seeing what lengths people would go to for the fix of their next hit, and I was going to extort every single thing that had extorted me for my entire life.¬†

With the 107 dollars I had left, I bought a mask, a toy gun, and some black spray paint. I painted the gun to look identical to a real gun, so much so that if the police had seen me with it that would have been the end of my journey right then and there.

I took the gun and the mask, changed into some all-black clothing from the Goodwill stash, and went out looking for someone unlucky enough to be working behind the gas station counter for the third shift.

My first stop was a BP on the outskirts of the town just right before the main road. I got exactly what I needed from the clerk. The prop gun had worked perfectly. After that, I figured that since everything had moved so smoothly and swiftly with the first robbery I might as well try my luck again with a second store.

I made my way, this time, into a convenience store also near the outskirts of town, but on the other side of the town a few blocks away. Again, everything worked perfectly. Just me in the store, no cars around, and a tired cashier who isn‚Äôt willing to risk his life over a store that isn‚Äôt his.

I made off with the money from his register BACK to the woods; only this time I was going into the woods with a little over 700 dollars in my pocket. Also this time I didn‚Äôt have to walk extraneously far. I dipped two towns over because let‚Äôs face it, who cares about a gas station getting robbed two towns over by an unnamed assailant‚Ä¶ that could‚Äôve been anybody‚Ä¶.

Plus the gun and the mask had been dumped and buried under as many rocks as I could find in a stream in the middle of the woods.¬†

I had no reason to not be confident right now. I knew I could make something work with what money I had in my pocket.¬†

Dawn was rolling in around the time that I got into town though; which meant that there would be considerably more people out and about. I didn‚Äôt wanna get too careless but also, I was DONE with spending my nights in the woods.

I found another hotel, this one being 150 for the night so I paid for my room and just hid out trying to come up with a plan on what to do next. I wasn‚Äôt gonna let my mind fail me; too many massive risks had been taken for me to even be up here so I was racking my brain.

At some point while laying on the bed thinking I saw a small little dot on the wall‚Ä¶

It was a spider.¬†

Spiders have always creeped me out and I‚Äôve always hated them but today for some reason I felt at peace with the little fella. However, I did NOT‚Ä¶want this thing in my room.¬†

I grabbed a coffee cup from the little hotel room desk along with a paper towel to put under it. I slid the spider into the cup and sealed the top with the paper towel before letting it out on the balcony.

‚ÄúToday you, tomorrow me,‚Äù I whisper with a slight chuckle, before returning to bed‚Ä¶and getting some much-needed sleep.¬†",1,1757764516.0,stories,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

That was a month ago and I thought she was done coming in but I was wrong. She came in today, within my first hour at work no less, to get her cup of coffee. I just ignore and don't engage with her. I think she took offense to that 

She waited until I was nearly in the back for her to call out, ""Hey deadname"".

To which my coworker tells her, ""it's newname, actually""

And shout out, ""we ain't doing this"".

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins.

The supervisor, otherwise esteemed for their judicious leadership, succumbed to a momentary lapse in spatial awareness, with the result that a cup of coffee, heretofore regarded as a benign stimulant, became the catalyst for an inadvertent, and quite ignominious, descent to the floor.

Simultaneously, Ms. Sue, in an act that could generously be described as experimental, subjected her socks to the ostensibly civilizing influence of microwave radiation. This unorthodox initiative, however, precipitated a pyrotechnic event of minor but memorable scale, evincing a disregard for both textile integrity and communal safety, and ultimately engendering a state of collective consternation among her colleagues.

Mr. Larry, demonstrating a singular capacity for maladroit innovation, succeeded in entwining his own necktie with a stapler, thus constructing a conundrum of his own making. His efforts to extricate himself, while earnest, achieved little more than to amplify the prevailing sense of professional spectacle, rendering his predicament a subject of immediate office lore.

The information technology specialist, hitherto engaged in the consumption of carbohydrates, perceived the scene with evident amusement, so much so that their involuntary expulsion of snack fragments upon the keyboard constituted a secondary breach of professional decorum. The cumulative effect of these episodes was a discernible erosion of workplace composure, bordering on collective cognitive dissonance.

Matters were not ameliorated by the abrupt cessation of wireless internet connectivity, which prompted a litany of supplications, invocations, and expletives directed at the router, an entity that, despite its technologically sophisticated underpinnings, remained obstinately indifferent to human entreaty.

Review Inside!,"Using the Samsung QN65S95D OLED TV over the past several weeks has been an interesting journey. This TV offers a feature-packed experience with its 65-inch OLED display and 4K resolution, and there‚Äôs a lot to love about it. However, no product is perfect, and some aspects did leave me scratching my head. Let's break it all down.

**Picture Quality That'll Spoil You for Anything Else**

OLED technology is no joke, and the pure blacks on this TV are simply mesmerizing. Watching a movie at night was nothing short of a cinematic experience. The contrast is so precise that it‚Äôs hard to go back to anything that doesn‚Äôt deliver similar quality. The Pantone-validated colors are spot-on, adding vibrancy and depth in a way that makes every scene pop. Thanks to the Real Depth Enhancer, there‚Äôs a slight 3D-esque feel to the image, which I noticed particularly in nature documentaries. My kids? They were in awe of some underwater scenes in 4K where even the tiniest bubbles had texture.  

**Immersive Gaming with Exceptional Motion Handling**

As someone who spends evenings gaming, I tested the Motion Xcelerator with its 144Hz refresh rate extensively. It genuinely delivered ultra-smooth motion, even in fast-paced action games. There wasn‚Äôt any noticeable lag, and screen tearing was non-existent. It‚Äôs worth mentioning, though, that not all consoles or games are optimized for 144Hz, so the benefit you get will depend on what you're playing. Still, if you‚Äôre a gamer like me, this display is leagues ahead in providing smooth and crisp visuals, even during rapid transitions.  

**Lighting Conditions and Glare-Free Viewing**

One of my pet peeves with TVs is how much glare they catch during daytime, making watching anything an exercise in frustration. The Samsung OLED TV's anti-glare coating lives up to its promise. We have our setup in a relatively bright living room, and the image remained sharp no matter the time of day. My partner was thrilled that the morning sun reflecting off the coffee table didn‚Äôt wash out the TV‚Äôs vibrant picture anymore.  

[Check SAMSUNG QN65S95DAFXZA price on Amazon.](https://raltv.com/p/b0cv9bpf93/)

**Audio That Matches On-Screen Action**

One word: Dolby Atmos. I‚Äôm someone who used to have a dedicated sound system just to get decent TV audio, but the built-in Object Tracking Sound+ changed my entire setup. For real, when watching a car chase, the sound actually ""moved"" like a car speeding across the room. It‚Äôs eerie in the best way possible. That said, hardcore audiophiles might still prefer a dedicated sound system or soundbar, but for most users, the audio output will exceed expectations.  

**Interface and Smart Features**

Samsung's Tizen OS is both a pleasure and a minor frustration. It‚Äôs super intuitive, and setting up streaming apps took me no time. Voice assistant compatibility (Alexa, Google Assistant) is a massive plus for my lazy moments‚Äî""Show me Top Gun"" got the movie on in an instant. However, creating a Samsung account is required to unlock all the smart TV features, which might rub some people the wrong way. Without the account, you'll mainly use it as a basic TV for HDMI connections or terrestrial programming.  

**Design That‚Äôs Sleek but Large**

It‚Äôs pretty clear Samsung wants this to look premium, and it does. The Graphite Black bezel makes it sleek, and it feels solid with its 63.9-pound build. However, its depth of about 10.5 inches means it juts out a bit if you‚Äôre planning on a wall mount. For a cabinet-style setup, it‚Äôs not an issue, but my friend who helped me install it did comment on how installing it directly on the wall could feel bulky, especially compared to slimmer designs from other brands.  

**Positives**

- Stunning OLED-powered visuals with true blacks and vibrant colors.  
- Outstanding motion clarity for gaming, thanks to the 144Hz refresh rate.  
- Dolby Atmos and Object Tracking Sound+ deliver impressive, immersive audio.  

**Limitations**

- Slightly bulkier build might not be ideal for every wall-mounted space.  
- Full smart features inaccessible without creating/login to Samsung account.  

**Competing Brands**

I couldn't help but compare this with LG's OLED options, especially something like the LG C3 Series OLED TV. While LG offers impeccable picture quality and a slightly thinner form factor, it doesn't match Samsung's 144Hz refresh rate and Dolby Atmos audio tracking. Sony‚Äôs A95L is another fierce competitor in terms of cinematic quality, though it might lack the same anti-glare finish as this model. Should you prioritize pure display over additional smart features, LG might be your pick; however, if you‚Äôre seeking a mix of both excellent audio and visuals, this Samsung TV delivers well on both fronts.  

**Price Worthiness**

Features like anti-glare, Dolby Atmos, and AI-powered 4K upscaling make this TV feel like a premium product. It‚Äôs definitely positioned for those willing to invest in future-proof technology. Compared to other OLED TVs, its price feels justified considering the extras packed into it. That said, if gaming isn‚Äôt your focus or you don‚Äôt care much about built-in sound systems, you might find similar results for less cost from competing brands.

Alt text: Professional business people in a meeting discussing compliance. noting a sharp uptick in company registrations across new financial, logistic, and clean-energy ventures‚Äîespecially in Bahrain Bay and the Diplomatic Area. According to Forbes Business, Bahrain continues to attract startups and established enterprises, drawn by 99% foreign ownership, zero personal income tax, and competitive corporate tax rates.\
And yet‚Äîthe government‚Äôs Environment Affairs Directorate (under the Supreme Council for Environment) has stepped up inspection, monitoring, and enforcement, driving a 37% increase in regulatory actions in 2024-2025 alone (Source: bahrain.com).\
Key 2025 developments:\
- Tighter controls on waste, emissions, and hazardous materials for new company formations\
- Updated environmental fines (from January 1, 2025)\
- Digitalized compliance tracking via the Sijilat portal\
Importantly, I‚Äôve seen fast-growth founders sidelined by compliance issues they simply didn‚Äôt anticipate. (I once spent over 15 hours at the MOICT simply to resolve a documentation gap‚Äîsomething that could have been avoided with better pre-planning.)\
If you want a strong foundation for Bahrain company formation, environmental risk must be a central pillar.\

Reporting and documentation requirements\
\
Who‚Äôs affected?\
* Every entity with a Commercial Registration (CR) via Sijilat\
* Industrial, manufacturing, construction, logistics, and food service companies\
* Free zone and mainland companies alike\
Even small consulting firms in Bahrain Bay or the Seef District face penalties for improper document retention or contractor mismanagement. I once saw a digital marketing agency fined BHD 500 for not segregating e-waste from regular office garbage‚Äîa wake-up call for all directors.\

The True Costs: Fines, Downtime, and Reputational Loss\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for company formation in Bahrain.:**\
- Minor office waste offense: BHD 500 ‚Äì BHD 2,000\
- Medium manufacturing spill: BHD 10,000 ‚Äì BHD 25,000 + remediation\
- Major pollution event: BHD 30,000+ plus civil action\
- Typical environmental audit: BHD 900 ‚Äì BHD 1,800 (for small entities)\
Plus:\
* Business interruption (average: 2-10 days downtime for regulatory review)\
* Staff retraining, process change, legal consultations (BHD 500 ‚Äì BHD 5,000)\
* Brand damage: Listed on public non-compliance registers\
For a detailed breakdown of formation costs and compliance budgets, see Keylink‚Äôs Bahrain company formation cost guide.\
Personal aside: I once advised a cafe in the Seef District. Their disposal of cooking oil wasn‚Äôt documented for three months. The result? A BHD 7,500 fine, three-day closure, and a (thankfully short-lived) customer dip. They now have a digital waste log and monthly team training‚Äîtotal annual cost: under BHD 1,000.\
\
Step-by-Step: Preventing Environmental Penalties in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation for regulatory compliance in Bahrain. and commercial registration in Bahrain.\
\
Practical Example: How I Navigated a Compliance Hurdle\
I was once caught out by a minor misalignment between our waste storage area and the site plan submitted to the Supreme Council. Instead of a costly penalty, I contacted a local consultant (Al-Jazira Environmental Solutions)‚Äîthey expedited an inspection, provided a compliant storage blueprint, and secured the updated certificate in 48 hours. The key? Having digital PDF plans ready and maintaining a WhatsApp relationship with the EDB desk. Saved our team from a BHD 5,000 fine and avoided a shutdown.\
\
Save money: Hire a consultant for an initial mock audit (BHD 800‚ÄìBHD 1,500) to ensure everything aligns before formal inspections.\
\
Surprisingly, informal business connections‚Äîthose built over shared qahwa or at weekend football matches‚Äîoften lead to smoother approvals and quicker feedback from officials. Don‚Äôt underestimate the role of relationship capital in Bahrain business.\
\
Entity Types and Ownership: What Structure Best Shields You?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain.. Your choice of entity can impact compliance burden and exposure to liability.\
Options include:\
- With Limited Liability Companies (WLL/LLC): Lower personal risk, but directorship still carries compliance duties.\
- Single Person Companies (SPC): Faster setup but higher scrutiny.\
- Branches of foreign companies: Subject to local and parent regulations.\
- Bahrain Shareholding Companies (BSC): Suitable for larger projects.\
Most foreign entrepreneurs choose WLL for flexibility.\
Check 99% foreign ownership in Bahrain and foreigner-friendly company activities for full eligibility.\
Pro tip: Free zone setups can streamline environmental pre-approvals, but always check the zone‚Äôs specific environmental regime.\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi Arabia: Compliance with an Advantage\
Compared to the UAE (more complex multi-emirate regulation) or Saudi Arabia (slower permit turnaround), Bahrain‚Äôs process is faster, more digital, and generally less expensive‚Äîif you know the right offices, times, and contacts. For multinationals and startups alike, this means lower entry barriers but zero tolerance for late compliance.\
\
A Tangent on Coffee Service: Why Details Matter\
During my first compliance visit to the LMRA office, the building manager offered traditional gahwa service. Pausing for this small ritual delayed my meeting by 10 minutes‚Äîbut built enough goodwill to ensure my paperwork was double-checked for errors by a helpful clerk. Details matter. In Bahrain, relationships built over hospitality can protect your bottom line.\
\
2025 Regulatory Change: New Digital Penalty Notifications\
From Q1 2025, all environmental violations are now notified instantly through Sijilat and registered email. There‚Äôs now no ‚Äúgrace period‚Äù before enforcement.\
- Implementation: January 1, 2025\
- Action: Companies must ensure the Sijilat account is monitored 24/7 and key staff registered for SMS alerts.\
Miss a notification and your business could be suspended before you even realize there‚Äôs an issue.\
\
Support, Resources, and Mistake Prevention\
\
Alt text: Professional business support in Bahrain. or in summer (government offices move slower).\
Prevention strategy:\
- Prepare all reporting templates and permit paperwork in both Arabic and English.\
- Use Keylink‚Äôs accounting and bookkeeping services for document preparation and compliance tracking.\
- Schedule in-person submissions for early mornings in the Seef District (parking is easier, lines are shorter).\
- Monitor Bahrain.com and Gulf News Bahrain for regulatory updates.\
I always recommend Keylink‚Äîthey‚Äôve consistently anticipated policy shifts and have a deep bench of local experts for technical questions.\
\
FAQ: Environmental Compliance and Company Formation in Bahrain\
Q1: Can free zone companies avoid environmental fines?\
No. Free zone companies are subject to the same, or sometimes stricter, environmental regulations as mainland companies. Always check with the local free zone authority and Supreme Council for Environment for your specific obligations.\
Read more on Bahrain free zones here.\
Q2: What‚Äôs the fastest way to get my environmental permit?\
Apply online via Sijilat with all supporting floorplans, waste management contracts, and training documents ready. Appoint a local consultant to pre-approve your documentation‚Äîcan save up to two weeks compared to ‚Äúdo-it-yourself‚Äù approach.\
See Bahrain company formation process.\
Q3: What is the minimum compliance budget for a small office?\
As of 2025, budget BHD 900‚ÄìBHD 1,800 annually for permit renewals, waste handling, and occasional compliance training. Major industries should budget BHD 5,000‚ÄìBHD 30,000+ depending on activity and risk profile.\
Check full cost breakdowns here.\
Q4: Can a local sponsor help mitigate penalties?\
A good local sponsor can provide advice, introductions, and negotiation support with regulatory bodies but is not a legal shield against non-compliance. Your company (and directors) remain fully liable.\
Learn more about local sponsorship.\
Q5: What happens after a non-compliance fine is issued?\
Immediate payment is required via the Sijilat portal. Operations may be suspended until rectification. Repeat offenders risk public blacklisting and CR revocation.\
Find out about commercial registration requirements.\

Bahrain offers world-class opportunities for ambitious founders and multinational investors. But environmental compliance is your non-negotiable ticket to long-term success.

-Get traditional tattoos.  You don't need a DD-214 to get swallowes, anchors, full mast ships tattooed on you.  Even if you wanted to get a tattoo of dad or grandads old ship.  That's fine, just don't pretend to have served.  The only exception is SEAL stuff.  Don't go putting tridents or bone frogs on yourself.

-Joe Navy gear.  No one is gonna call you a stolen valor for wearing a sweatshirt that says, ""Navy"" on it.  Same with hats, t-shirts, coffee mugs, etc.  As long as you're honest.

""Cool hat, we're you in the Navy?""

""No, my kid/spouse/parent/friend is/was""

That's cool and the gang.

-Old uniform gear.  Again, as long as you're not fronting about being in, I don't care that you bought a pea coat at the thrift store with a rank patch on it.

1nfuzfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1nfuzfm/it_never_gets_old_and_it_keeps_getting_better/,It never gets old and it keeps getting better.,"Hi All,

Just wanted to share some Saturday morning sober reflections because weekends were the hardest thing for me at the beginning of this journey. If you're struggling today, I see you. 

Although I had phases of being a daily drinker, my strategy for ""controlling"" my drinking the last few years of my career was to white knuckle it Sunday-Thursday and let it rip Fridays and Saturdays. Of course on holidays, vacations, etc. it was a free for all but that was my system. This resulted in me essentially lighting 2-3 days of my week every week completely on fire and spending the rest of them operating at a lower level because my body was still physically recovering and my mind remained fixated on the next opportunity to drink. I thought I was having fun, letting off steam, and rewarding myself for a week of hard work. In reality, I was making my world small, undermining my own goals, and never truly resting or recovering from anything.

As I creep up on 21 months alcohol free, I've noticed that I'm naturally waking up earlier feeling refreshed. My dog is thrilled that I pop up, grab a cup of coffee (from my kitchen I was actually able to clean before bed) and get her first walk of the day in before the sun comes up. Going to play some video games while I wait for the gym to open at 7am. Then I have plans to bake scones for the first time and enjoy watching some afternoon baseball games. In the before times, if I was up at 5am on a Saturday it was to throw up or drag myself to get some ice water because I felt like a poisoned rat (I read that description of a hangover once in a short story and it always stuck with me). My life is fuller and calmer and I'm able to roll with the punches and stay on top of my shit so I rarely feel that total overwhelm which was nearly constant when my drinking caused me to constantly put things off both at work and at home. My weekend days feel long. It's wild. 

The beginning is hard. It's really hard. We spend so much time and energy organizing our entire lives around this stupid shit that we don't know what to do or who we are without it. Do literally whatever it takes to just get through today; there is no perfect way to stop drinking. With time, it gets easier. There will be a Friday that rolls around and you don't even think about alcohol. And if you do, it's a fleeting thought followed by a sense of gratitude that you don't have to go there anymore. This is a gift you have to fight for, but it's worth it. It'll never get old, and it'll keep getting better. I won't drink with you all today. ‚úåÔ∏èüß°",41,1757762454.0,stopdrinking,6,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 17-year-old scrawny kid living in northern Sweden. Never got much attention from anyone besides my parents. Bad at sports, not the best-looking, not funny enough.  
It didn‚Äôt crush me, but it didn‚Äôt help either.

Even though life was rough, I had one thing. Physics.  
Not just good grades. I was built for it. Especially the weird stuff. Time travel. Wormholes. Closed timelike curves.

I‚Äôve read every serious book and paper ever written on the subject from general relativity to quantum gravity.  
Most people think it's all sci-fi, but there are actual solutions to Einstein‚Äôs field equations that allow for closed timelike curves. Theoretical paths through spacetime that loop back on themselves.

When I realized it's not about whether time travel is possible, but what physics *allows*, I cracked the code. I knew how to do it. I just had to build the machine.

One week before my 18th birthday, I finished it.  
No flashing lights. No flux capacitor. Just a wormhole stabilizer built in my tiny teenage bedroom.

One mouth stayed in my room. The other? I sent it on a relativistic loop using a homemade particle accelerator. Time passed slower on that end. That created the gap.

The interface is just an old laptop running my code. Looks like a retro game, but it‚Äôs synced to the wormhole‚Äôs time offset. I can input a specific date. year, month, even day and the system adjusts accordingly.  
The software handles the math. I just tell it when I want to go.

Of course I wanted to use it immediately.  
But where? Ancient Greece? The Jurassic period? Early 1900s? I wasted no time.

**First trip: one week back.**  
Just enough to win the lottery. It worked. Perfectly.  
One day I was broke, living on instant noodles. The next? Millionaire. Quietly. Nobody suspected a thing. But money was just the beginning.

**Second trip: 1945.**  
I stood at the edge of history, watching the world shift. Then back. Just watching.

**Third trip: The Library of Alexandria.**  
This one was personal.  
I snuck in around 200 BC. Scrolls, scholars, ancient knowledge you could feel in the air. I tried to memorize what I could. But I knew if I brought anything back I could change everything.  
I left empty-handed. And honestly? That hurt more than I expected.

**Fourth trip: Before I was born.**  
I just wanted to see them. My parents. Before they had me.

They were so young. Laughing over coffee. Arguing about baby names.  
They looked... free. So full of hope. They had no idea what I‚Äôd build.  
I watched from a distance. Left before I cried.   
It was the first time I felt like I didn‚Äôt belong anywhere.

**Fifth trip: 2044. The future.**  
I saw cities. Cold, clean, quiet. Everyone tracked. Everything controlled.  
Just a peek into the future. Scary stuff. Not gonna lie.  
  
**The aftermath**  
With every jump, I felt... more in control. Like a god hiding behind acne and a physics hoodie.  
The kid who no one noticed was now everywhere every when.

But the more I used it, the more I realized I wasn‚Äôt just bending time. I was bending morality.  
I fixed small things. Stopped an accident here. Prevented a breakup there.  
Until I started deciding who deserved what. Who should live. Who shouldn‚Äôt.

One night, I stared at the screen. I had just come back from stopping something horrible. Something history said was ‚Äúmeant to happen.‚Äù And I felt proud. But also... wrong.

I realized I was becoming the kind of person I used to be terrified of. Someone who thinks they know better than everyone else. Just because I could.

So I did the only thing that felt right.

I deleted the software. Ripped the stabilizer from the floor. Burned every note.  
The machine didn‚Äôt explode in dramatic sci-fi fashion. It just... stopped.

Now it‚Äôs gone. Forever.

I still have the memories. The power. The knowledge. But I made a promise. Never again.

Time isn‚Äôt meant to be owned. Not by me. Not by anyone.  
I had the power to change history. But in the end... I chose not to.",2,1757762025.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Even being 1‚Äì2% low on fluids can mess with your focus, memory, and mood. It‚Äôs enough to give you headaches, make you cranky, and slow down your reaction time. Basically, your brain turns into a sluggish potato.

Think of it like this: your brain is kind of like a sponge. When it‚Äôs full of water, it works smoothly. When it‚Äôs dried out, it shrinks a bit and has to work harder to do the same stuff. That‚Äôs why dehydration can feel almost exactly like being underslept.

A couple of easy fixes that helped me:
	‚Ä¢	Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning before coffee. Coffee‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs a mild dehydrator. Starting your day with coffee on an empty (and already dry) system is like running a car without oil.
	‚Ä¢	Get a bottle with measurements (like 500ml or 1L). Most people think they drink enough water but have no clue how much they actually get. Once you start tracking, you‚Äôll see where you‚Äôre really at.
	‚Ä¢	If plain water is boring, throw in lemon, cucumber, or even a splash of juice. Makes it way easier to stick to.
	‚Ä¢	If you sweat a lot, don‚Äôt just replace water ‚Äî add electrolytes too. A pinch of salt in your food or a low-sugar hydration packet does the trick.

I used to hit a wall every afternoon and thought I was just ‚Äúone of those tired people.‚Äù Turns out, I was basically running on high caffeine + low water. Swapping in a few glasses of water throughout the day made more difference than any energy drink ever did.

So next time you‚Äôre foggy and reaching for coffee number 4, try water first. You might be surprised how fast your brain clears up.",424,1757761777.0,LifeProTips,20,0.96,False
1nfur9s,https://i.redd.it/r4wg4x5tzwof1.jpeg,The Truth Behind Korea‚Äôs ‚ÄúNext-Level‚Äù Cafes,"Okay, so everyone loves the vibe at those ultra-fancy Korean cafes. But little do you know, most of these places aren‚Äôt just about good coffee or pretty desserts. They‚Äôre basically elaborate tax shelters for wealthy real estate mogul/heirs.
Here‚Äôs the truth: Korea‚Äôs inheritance tax hits crazy high levels, so when it‚Äôs time to pass on the family fortune, these moguls buy expensive plot of land, build next level caf√©s, and put their own kids in charge. The caf√© ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù is just a front‚Äîthey get cushy jobs and salaries, but it‚Äôs really about transferring prime land to heirs while dodging massive tax bills.
When the parent passes away, the property gets handed down at a fraction of its real value, so the taxes don‚Äôt destroy the inheritance. Meanwhile, the spoiled kids who otherwise have no life skills are set for rich man‚Äôs life running a massive caf√©, even if the place barely breaks even.
So next time you shell out for a ‚Ç©10,000 latte in one of those fancy coffee shops, remember: you‚Äôre not just paying for overpriced beans, you‚Äôre standing in the middle of a billion-won loophole.
If you want to support millionaire spoiled kids, fine. But if you really want to support Korean coffee culture, go to the small neighborhood independent roastery. Some of them true gems, without massive dose of sugary syrups. 

Source: almost married one of the spoiled child with their own cafe. Glad I dodged that bullet.

Before I start I‚Äôd like to give a bit of backstory, I (22F) used to work at this place that makes burritos, it was really fun and before I left it was around Halloween, so naturally we get given treats and sweets to take home.

I chose the 1.5kg Cadbury Chocolate Bar (could have been 850g I‚Äôm not sure) so I take it to my grandma‚Äôs for safe keeping to use for baking and such (since I enjoy baking at my grandma‚Äôs and we do it together) 
The thing is, my nana has had a bit of an eating issue for a while, I‚Äôm not gonna lie, she is fat. While this isn‚Äôt an issue it‚Äôs not good for her health, especially with things like COPD and osteoporosis. 

Last night, I decided to finally help myself to a bit, I was craving chocolate (I don‚Äôt eat things like chocolate a lot) and what do I find? 
All, Of, it, IS GONE! Not even the wrapper is left. I remember my nana asking ‚Äòcan I have some‚Äô and I say ‚Äòsure‚Äô because of course she isn‚Äôt gonna finish a gift I got for my work or a chocolate bar that big? NOPE.

I finally go to talk to her about it today, telling her I‚Äôm upset and that I feel like some form of trust has been broken. However, she says that ‚Äòwell whenever you go to the shops for me, you get stuff for yourself‚Äô the thing is, she says ‚Äòget stuff for yourself‚Äô or I say ‚ÄòI‚Äôll transfer money so I can get XYZ‚Äô I then explain this and she says ‚Äòwell I‚Äôm sorry but, I thought you didn‚Äôt want it, it was there for a year, cmon‚Äô things kept on going in circles until I finally went to go have a coffee, which is where I am now. 

So, Reddit, AIO? Am I being silly and childish for caring so much about chocolate?

The door didn‚Äôt slam. That would have been too final, too dramatic. It only clicked, soft as a throat clearing, as if it understood she wasn‚Äôt ready. For a moment she kept her hand pressed against the handle, palm flat, breathing shallow, pretending she could reverse time just by holding on. She couldn‚Äôt.

The hallway smelled of plaster and old dinners. Her neighbors were cooking‚Äîgarlic, onions, oil snapping in pans‚Äîmundane comforts that already felt like someone else‚Äôs life. She carried them with her, like scents get carried in hair, but they weren‚Äôt hers anymore. The walls were lined with faint pencil scratches from furniture dragged, from suitcases before hers, from lives that had left and never come back.

The suitcase was heavier than it should have been. Not with clothes‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt pack much, folding them badly, half by habit, half in panic. The weight came from everything it represented: her house collapsed into fabric, zippers that caught on themselves, plastic wheels that squealed against the concrete floor. When she gripped the handle, the ridged plastic dug into her palm. She told herself it was a bruise she would be proud of.

Every step down the stairwell was loud, echoing. The suitcase thumped with each floor, announcing her departure to no one. Her chest carried two voices: one that whispered, keep going, and another, sharper, that sounded like her parents: don‚Äôt disappoint us. Don‚Äôt come back broken.

Outside, the night air was cold enough to bite her lips. She pulled her coat tighter, a second skin against the city that had already started to disown her. She repeated her rules under her breath: don‚Äôt trust anyone, don‚Äôt stop walking, don‚Äôt make eye contact too long, don‚Äôt vanish. Rules felt safer than hope.

At the bus stop, neon light washed her face pale. She watched strangers with bags bigger than hers, lives packed more carefully. She thought: maybe they‚Äôre running too. Maybe we‚Äôre all fugitives pretending to be travelers. When the bus hissed open, she climbed in without looking back. The city outside the window blurred into a movie she no longer starred in.

She practiced sentences in her head, ones she might need later: I live here now. I‚Äôm fine. I don‚Äôt need anything. The lies tasted rehearsed, already believable. She pressed her forehead to the glass, watching streets she knew by heart slip past like memories she‚Äôd already decided not to keep.

Chapter 2 ‚Äî The First Taste

It began as a warmth around the edges, a late sun that pretended to be mercy. Not a shout, a murmur‚Äîattention that arrived like a hand on the shoulder you didn‚Äôt know was cold. A message at a careless hour. A compliment too direct to be safe. A laugh that unlocked a childhood memory of doors opening without questions.

You told yourself not to read into it. And then you read into it. The phone face lit your face. A small glow that argued with the dark corners of the room. You tried to say the words out loud‚Äîit‚Äôs nothing‚Äîbut the body didn‚Äôt believe you. It made space for hope with the instinct of a host setting extra places at a table.

Days recalibrated themselves around the possibility of a sound. The buzz-beat-beep that said you mattered to someone else‚Äôs nervous system for three seconds. The world shrank to a screen and widened to a fantasy in the same movement. Good morning, beautiful‚Äîyou could hold that in your mouth for hours like hard candy. You did not check for cavities.

There were misalignments you called charm. The answers that curved away from the question. Plans that dissolved when the air touched them. You forgave with the speed of rain evaporating from a hot pavement: no evidence left, just steam and the memory of wet. You believed you were patient. You believed patience was love‚Äôs instrument. You did not notice it had been tuned to someone else‚Äôs song.

You curated a life that could pass inspections. Work that took more of you than you had. Rituals so small they counted as faith: a specific mug, the lazy loop you walked around the block when the heart galloped, the window you opened to let the night in, as if it were safer outside your head. On shelves and in pockets you kept souvenirs no one else could identify‚Äîa bus ticket, a receipt, a button‚Äîeach a breadcrumb back to a feeling.

You edited the story for friends. You cut the scenes where you waited. You highlighted the glitter‚Äîthe accidental tenderness, the texts that landed exactly where you needed them, the sentence that made your spine remember it used to be a lighthouse. You didn‚Äôt lie. You just left out the weather warnings.

The body‚Äîloyal, inconvenient‚Äîkept a ledger anyway. The stomach that cramped after promises. The throat that closed before sleep. The hands that trembled when the phone stayed still long enough for honesty to arrive. You wrote private advisories on the inside of your lips: be careful, be careful, be careful. Then you kissed over them.

And when the first small absence came, it made a noise like something falling in the next room. You sat very still and told yourself it was nothing. But already a crack was measuring the wall, making lines only you could see.



Chapter 3 ‚Äî The Drug

What you named love refined itself into dosage: attention as milligrams, absence as nausea. A ritual emerged and pretended to be devotion. You learned to metabolize uncertainty like a vitamin you couldn‚Äôt live without. You hid the side effects in tidy drawers: insomnia, skipped meals, the particular ache of waiting while pretending not to.

Friends thinned at the edges. They were not cruel; they were tired. You told the shorter version. You laughed at your own punchlines to keep them from worrying. You convinced yourself that endurance was intimacy‚Äîif you held out long enough, the shape of you would be recognized, the door would unlock, the bed would become two-sided and then one.

Losses arrived dressed as fate. A funeral where your mouth forgot how to speak without cracking. A family gathering where you smiled like a photograph‚Äîthat is, as proof, not as feeling. Rooms kept losing their heat. The mirror failed at certain angles. The commute became a tunnel with no ad posters, only your reflection in the glass, multiplied and unpersuaded.

The night you dialed the helpline, you rehearsed a softer voice, the one that didn‚Äôt scare strangers. A human answered. Kind, perhaps. Scripted, certainly. The space between their questions and your answers filled with an air you could not breathe. You hung up empty-handed and heavier, like sadness had been poured back into you from a height.

What remained was a math problem you couldn‚Äôt solve: every time you added yourself up, something came out missing. The house became a set. The country became a coat two sizes too large. You sat on the edge of your bed and understood that gravity had a different plan for you than you had for yourself.

You packed the warnings into a suitcase and called it planning.


Chapter 4 ‚Äî Collapse

There isn‚Äôt always an event. Sometimes collapse is a long hallway with the lights flickering out one by one until you forget you used to see. You fed yourself rules: show up, pay on time, keep the plants alive, return messages within a humane window. You thought structure could scaffold a soul. It can‚Äîfor a while.

You became inventory: units of sleep, milliliters of water, miles walked to make the body forget what the mind remembered. You counted things because counting promised borders. Some nights the border held. Some nights you slipped under the fence and woke in a field with no language. You took notes to prove to yourself you‚Äôd been there. The notes frightened you when you read them in daylight. You stopped reading them in daylight.

Death grew nearer, not because the people you loved died (though that, too) but because the ordinary lost its voice. Bread tasted like compliance. Music like manipulation. The shower was a negotiation you sometimes lost. When you did laugh‚Äîit happened; sweetness is sneaky‚Äîyou scanned the moment for traps, as if joy had a small print you kept missing.

When the door finally opened, it wasn‚Äôt a miracle so much as muscle memory: leave. You pulled the suitcase across an apartment that had learned to hold its breath. The passport warmed against your hip, a ticket and a talisman. You told no one who might stop you. You told someone who wouldn‚Äôt. You folded the last of your shirts and smelled your own fabric like it was the house saying goodbye.

Stations don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs their mercy. Boards flip. Timetables insist on their own truth. You found a seat that allowed you to face backward. Watching where you‚Äôve been is easier than watching where you‚Äôre going. The city unstitched itself in the window and did not bleed.

On the border, an officer stamped a page he did not read. Permission looks official when you need it to. You crossed because crossing was the only verb that didn‚Äôt accuse you.

Chapter 5 ‚Äî The Escape

New street, new alphabet of corners. Your footsteps learned a different drum. You measured the rooms by how quickly they forgot other voices. You bought bowls and called it nesting. The kettle boiled in a language you were sure you could learn. At the market, you held fruit the way you wished to be held: gently, as if bruise were not a metaphor but a daily hazard.

You found work‚Äîenough to keep stillness from turning predatory. A coworker with wind-chapped hands taught you where to eat cheaply and where not to walk after midnight. You pretended to be this person: a newcomer with a legal name that matched their documents, a future planned in pencil, a mouth that could hold its own.

It is possible to begin again. It is also possible to drag the past across the border hidden in a spare battery and the phrases you choose during silence. The old hunger had not lost your address; it forwarded itself. The new face wore different cologne, told better jokes, promised without overpromising‚Äîskillful, as if repetition had made him efficient.

You hedged, then fell. You built conditions like fences and then held the gate open with your foot. The mirrored bathroom learned what your shoulders do when you‚Äôre choosing self-betrayal. You called it generosity. You said: this time I can hold my center. You watched yourself move the center six inches to make room for him. You called it compromise. The floor called it gravity.

Narcissism wears polish when it travels. Cruelty learns to smile with its teeth tucked away. You made a calendar of apologies and could not find two that matched in substance. Your intuition shook you by the lapels; you smoothed your collar and called yourself dramatic. The day you finally named it, you whispered as if speaking truth too loudly might ruin your hearing.

The mirror did an awful thing: it agreed with you. You went very still. You let the room hear it.

Chapter 6 ‚Äî The Breakdown

There is a competence that hides collapse so well you can wear it to work. You wore it. You filed and fetched and answered politely. You took your lunch outside and watched the world debt-collect from other people. You cried in the bathroom and fixed your face with the tenderness of a nurse who is also a patient.

The apartment kept you alive in small ways: a window that faced enough sky to remind you the planet was not a ceiling; a tap that started singing if you forgot to turn it all the way off; a neighbor who left their radio on low so the hallway hummed like a mammal sleeping. You put your palm on the kitchen table and asked it to hold you. It did what it could.

You put the passport in sight like an icon. It promised nothing and you projected everything. The truth arrived unadorned: paper is not power. Transport is not absolution. The border you needed to cross ran behind your ribs. To go home you‚Äôd have to stop using distance as a shield and silence as a second language. You hated this truth and then you fed it soup.

You didn‚Äôt announce the decision. You didn‚Äôt even admit it when you bought the boxes. You told yourself you were only sorting. You became the kind of person who gives away a chair and keeps a key. You left the country the way you arrived: with a suitcase that made too much noise and a face that knew better than to ask the city to bless you.

On the last night, you slept three hours and dreamt of a white room with a single mirror. No doors this time. The room waited for you to put yourself back where you belonged. You woke already moving.

Chapter 7 ‚Äî The Return

Nothing had changed. That was a gift. The streetlights made their familiar small halos. The station sold the same cheap coffee that tasted like resolve. The sky kept its weather secrets the way it always had. You exhaled something you didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd been holding since the first day you learned how to leave.

You did not audition for your old life. You stepped into rooms as if they had been renting your outline. You washed the sheets twice. You opened a box marked ‚Äúmisc‚Äù and found versions of yourself that had waited without judgment: a scarf that still knew your neck, a book with a bus ticket as a spine, a photo where your smile had not yet learned to perform. You sat on the floor and allowed nostalgia without considering it a sin.

Routines returned at the pace of trust. Morning light on the same table, the same mug, the same teaspoon‚Äôs pretend ceremony. You began writing again, not as a performance for witnesses you didn‚Äôt respect, but as a signal to yourself that you were worth reading. You answered messages without overexplaining. You learned how to say no like a hinge. Click, steady. Click, steady.

You did not become invulnerable. You cried without apologizing. You let grief eat at your edges and then you fed yourself back. You grew friendships slow and without choreography. You allowed quiet people to be enough company. On certain afternoons, you sat near a window and let the world arrange its own beauty without you forcing it.

When shame came back‚Äîas it does‚Äîyou offered it a chair instead of your throat. You asked it questions. It gave you weather reports, not orders. You walked to the corner shop and the woman at the till called you love and it landed like a key in a door you‚Äôd been leaning against. You went home lighter by nothing measurable.

The country hadn‚Äôt softened. You had.


---

Chapter 8 ‚Äî The Reckoning

The mirror did not change shape to flatter you. You changed shape to stop needing it to. You learned the inventory of your face without verdicts: the kindness that only arrives when you are tired of fighting yourself, the hardness that saves your life twice a year, the weary intelligence that knows how to parse a promise from a sales pitch.

You stopped auditioning for belonging. You picked yourself for the role that never had a casting call. You forgave the versions of you that mistook starvation for romance and vigilance for love. You kept some of their talent‚Äîhow to read a room, how to hear the part of a sentence that wasn‚Äôt spoken‚Äîand retired the rest.

This is not a phoenix story. There is no fire bright enough to justify the burning. This is a moss story: soft, stubborn, archaic, green even in shade. You covered your own ruins and called it living. You learned that tenderness is not a prize given for obedience but a muscle you exercise when no one is watching.

The passport sleeps in a drawer. Borders still exist; you simply no longer outsource your salvation to them. You travel lighter: less suitcase, more spine. You walk past mirrors and stop only when you want to admire how a person can look like themselves after all they‚Äôve survived.

You write a note and tape it inside the cupboard door, where only you will read it while reaching for tea: I was never gone. I only forgot where to look. On bad days, it‚Äôs an instruction. On good days, it‚Äôs a hymn. Most days, it‚Äôs domestic‚Äîan ordinary sentence holding the ceiling up.

The phone still buzzes. Sometimes it‚Äôs him, or someone calibrated to his frequency. Gravity remembers your name. But your feet learned a new physics. You let the buzz pass like weather through a well-built room. You pour the water. You wait for the boil. You live.

At night, you close the door with no fear the world will disappear without you witnessing it. It isn‚Äôt a triumph. It‚Äôs a practice. The future is not taller. It‚Äôs wider. You step into it, not to prove, not to atone, but because this is what you were always made for: the long, patient art of returning to yourself, again and again, until there is nowhere else left to go.





üìñ Chapter 9 ‚Äî The Dreaming Mirror

Stories don‚Äôt appear from nowhere. They crawl out of dreams, half-lit, soaked in symbols the waking mind doesn‚Äôt understand until it‚Äôs too late. This one was no exception.

The dreams were always divided: high places where mountains touched the ice, and lowlands where everything burned or crumbled into dust. There was never an in-between. Either the body froze in thin air, or it sank into lifeless ground. That was the logic of sleep‚Äîthe soul rehearsing survival in landscapes that refused balance.

In those nights, dead relatives returned as messengers. A father who never spoke, only drove. An aunt who offered comfort and then vanished. A grandfather who raged, his mind already lost in waking life and found again in nightmares. They were not ghosts. They were anchors. They appeared whenever the waking body drifted too far from itself, as if to remind: don‚Äôt forget where you came from, even if you can‚Äôt stay there.

The car came often too‚Äîunstable, swerving, driven by hands that didn‚Äôt feel like hands at all. Sometimes the dream turned cruel: deer‚Äôs hooves pressing the wheel, feet too clumsy for pedals. Driving without a license, without preparation, on roads that had no signs. It was absurd, but it was accurate. Because that was life outside the dream: steering with the wrong limbs, untrained, terrified, but moving forward anyway.

The hotel appeared most of all. A labyrinth of rooms that never belonged to you. Doors that led to libraries, hospitals, schools‚Äînever the room you paid for, never the one with your name on it. Always searching for a bed you could claim. Always denied. And wasn‚Äôt that the story itself? The long search for a room where the soul could rest, the endless refusal, the price that kept changing?

That is why this story arrived. Not for romance. Not for punishment. But to put order to the dreams. To say: this is not just a nightmare sequence, this is a map. The leaving, the drug, the collapse, the return‚Äîthey were not accidents. They were rehearsals written in the subconscious long before the waking mind had words for them.

The story demanded to be told so that the dream could be understood. It whispered: write me, or I will keep circling you in sleep. Face me, or I will keep sending the dead to speak in your ear. Admit me, or I will keep putting you in cars with deer‚Äôs hooves and hotels with no room.

And so here it is: not a novel, not a confession, but a reckoning between dream and day. The reason is not simple. The reason is survival. To write is to declare: I was never lost. I was dreaming. And now I am awake enough to name the dream.",1,1757760928.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

1nfuhsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Orkuneu/comments/1nfuhsi/orca/,ORCA,"ORCA ‚Äî Opening Monologue (English) September 13, 2025 

The genesis of all calamities hides in that repulsive and sacred interval just before morning; if God possesses a sense of humor‚Äîand at times I suspect it‚Äôs only a whisper shared among the cruel‚ÄîHe must have found pleasure, even a principle, in never showing it to us. Here I am, in this one-room cell, damp pajama cuffs clinging to my calves, drafting a march from the clatter of my teeth while I declare the obscene marriage of coffee and cigarettes to be breakfast. Behold, civilization! A tar-black sacrament sent to the stomach, a dark prayer inhaled into the lungs. The tables of this age are set for the lonely like me; they‚Äôve strewn coffee rings for linens and ash for ornament. Go on and laugh, because I will not: I merely take notes. My name is Orca. I‚Äôve stashed a vast darkness in my chest and lined it, like unlabeled bottles, with smoke, pain, and sleeplessness. And yes, before the sun has even considered rising, I already feel like an accountant of time: writing seconds into the ledger of debt, mortgaging minutes, embezzling hours. If God observes me thus, He surely marks a note in His book: ‚ÄúThis servant does not deserve my humor; he loves pain.‚Äù To love pain‚Äîto name it so‚Äîrepels many of you, me as well. Yet nausea has its own poetry: verses measured by the constriction of the chest, lines sealed by the froth of coffee. I am the most thankless reader of that poem. Observe now: the lap of sleep reminds me of an old lover‚Äôs scent‚Äîan embarrassment I never confess to anyone, only half to myself. If I pull sleep‚Äôs cord, the curtain will fall, I know; and when it does, I fear my worth will fall with it. Misplaced pride parades a petty wretch like me as a ‚Äútragic hero‚Äù along the corridors before dawn. Loneliness is the giant reel behind the stage; it lowers and raises the curtain. Each time, I assign myself roles: clown, saint, sinner, preacher‚Ä¶ I wear them all at once‚Äîand cannot bear a single one. This too is a kind of fault; perhaps the noblest: overdressing the self. Behold the clutter I‚Äôve collected: half-filled cups of coffee (some carry the imprint of my lips, others remain orphans like an unkissed shame), newspapers collapsed into a heap, each an early scribble of a different apocalypse; a table whose ashtray overflows, miniature mountains of grey. If it is a table at all‚Äîask me and I‚Äôll call it an altar. Upon this altar I lay sacrifices to the darkness before morning: a breath, a sip, a vigil. Waiting has its anatomy: shoulders slumping, the neck bending like a weary lyre, fingers clutching a broken rhythm. While my nails drift through ash as if searching for notes, I play an unknown music in my throat with coughs. ‚ÄúWill today‚Äôs tragedy make us smile tomorrow?‚Äù I ask myself, and another voice inside‚Äîlet its name be Orca as well‚Äîreplies: ‚ÄúThose who will laugh tomorrow clench their jaws today. Laughter is the interest accrued on stored-up chattering.‚Äù So I set my teeth free; let them speak shiveringly, complain by grinding against each other. I cannot say whether an accord will be reached, but at least there is a little parliament in my mouth; even without a verdict, the shouting lends a touch of warmth. Now you will call me a pessimist; I am merely a draft. Life proceeds in crossed-out sentences: the more we erase, the dirtier we become. That grey cloud the eraser leaves‚Äîyes, that is me. It gathers on the ceiling of my single room; sometimes it drips‚Äîindeed, the dampness of my pajama cuffs comes from there. Nature‚Äôs mocking finger trembles at the tip of the leaking ceiling: ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù it says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making fun.‚Äù I am angry not at God but at that finger most days. Another drop falls; another sentence inside me comes undone. As sentences unravel, I speak truer‚Äîfor truths are always written crooked. In that corner, the old television I suspect of strangling cables whispers like a grainy prophet; twist the antenna and I catch the world‚Äôs rehearsal of doomsday. Channels are like sects: each peddling salvation. I pursue deliverance in the geometry lesson of the ashtray: I count the butts circling the rim. Then I try to arrange the lies I tell with equal rigor‚Äîlying is one‚Äôs personal balm; you rub it in and the wrinkles vanish for a while. Yet I have learned to love the rind; I love to get lost in the maps opened by creases. This is the kindest cruelty I do to myself. Now you‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúOrca, if you praise pain, why complain of it?‚Äù Because I am honest; because praising pain is itself a variety of pain: a eulogy to one‚Äôs own executioner, smelling of both eroticism and squalor. On Sade‚Äôs stage, actors speak with the whip; on mine, the whip is time itself. Time descends on my back with senseless patience; I call this ‚Äúdiscipline.‚Äù Every pang has its etiquette; to suffer with manners is my aristocratic habit. Thus, as I greet the arrival of morning with the burnt taste in my mouth, I feel like a Marquis‚Äîno inheritance, no noble blood; but I possess the decorum of suffering. This is the only yardstick of modern nobility. As for the stubbornness of sleep: a strange theology stands between us. If I deny sleep, I am a sinner; if I chase it, an idolater. Best, then, to postpone it: postponement is the creed of our time. The postponers do not go to heaven; they govern their own hells by day. Long ago I built a small hell for myself: on its door I hung a sign‚Äî‚ÄúDo not disturb, a ceremony is in progress.‚Äù The ceremony is the dance of coffee and cigarettes; the low grumbles my organs produce to keep tempo. If you listen inward, you‚Äôll find an orchestra: the liver beats timpani, the stomach drones like a bassoon, the lungs aspire to horns. I am the conductor; my baton is the ember at the tip of the cigarette. Approaching the window, I watch shadows multiply outside. Dawn loiters behind the horizon like a blushing liar. Perhaps nature is ashamed of me‚Äîor perhaps I slander nature; either suits me. A small confession: at times I envy God. It is a grave sin to envy a being who can conceal His humor, I know; but envy has an aesthetic. To envy a thing is to orbit it in ritual. While envying God‚Äôs humor, I draw a circle around it; the rhythm of my steps becomes worship independent of me. Sanctity is repetition done well; repetition done poorly is addiction. I confuse the two; this is my original sin. Motor noises flutter in from outside‚Äîthe hurried buzz of early workers and latecomers. I hear them as a ‚Äúmarch of exiles.‚Äù Each goes to his own banishment: from the body, from the home, from the bread. My exile is within this room; yes, my geography is fixed, but the border gates of my heart deny a different passport each day. The only firm datum on my identification is eye color: not ‚Äúblack,‚Äù but ‚Äúnight.‚Äù Night is the mother tongue of my pupils. Daylight is like a foreign-language course: hard to pronounce, sour-faced instructor, homework absurd. Now I take the first sip slowly: the coffee punishes the tip of my tongue; I bow my head as though I‚Äôve earned the sentence. The cigarette seals a small stamp at the corner of my mouth: ‚ÄúOrca was here.‚Äù One signs one‚Äôs name in ink made of pain, more often than not. Hence, when I‚Äôm asked to ‚Äúdescribe your happiness,‚Äù I stammer; those pages will not take ink. But sorrow‚Äôs paper is thirsty; a single drop darkens the whole sheet. I am no writer of sorrow; I merely defend the dignity of being good absorbent paper. To absorb is to understand. Understanding isolates a person. Solitude, in the end, is a title‚Äîwithout ceremony, without decoration, yet deep-rooted. Perhaps one day I will laugh at today‚Äôs tragedy. If I do, I want to sharpen the teeth of that laughter here and now, by chattering. For laughter is the prize of accumulated gnashing. Thus I say, ‚ÄúA smile is the elegant revenge of postponed anger.‚Äù I seek the elegant revenge, not the crude. The days have beaten me many times; yet I loved not the days, but the dance of the beating. Within every thrashing lies a small waltz; learn its rhythm and even violence grows polite. And as I say all this, you may expect a plan, a route, a recipe for salvation‚Äîthe maps adored by the modern age. Do not ask for a map; I dislike giving directions. Roads are the lies invented by footsteps. I can offer only a bearing: downward. Dig into yourself. There‚Äôs surely a cellar within you: there, a similar table, a similar ashtray, a similar smell of coffee. You hold the key to that cellar; you simply never think to check your keyring. I hang my key upon the cigarette smoke‚Äîunseen, but present. The safest way to lose a thing is to hang it in front of your eyes, wrapped in mist. Now, like finishing an ancient text, I search the dregs at the bottom of the cup. Prophecy is alluring‚Äîbut I do not believe in prophecies. If I did, I would pick the piece that suits me; that too is a kind of honesty. ‚ÄúOrca,‚Äù I tell myself, ‚Äútoday will be a good day.‚Äù A lie; but a handsome lie. Handsome lies discipline the interior. A disciplined interior endures an undisciplined world. I keep the books on this endurance like a revenue office‚Äîslow, methodical, yet I know where the treasure is hidden: under the tongue. The tongue is the body‚Äôs secret pocket. Words are the forbidden candies stashed there. I take out another now, pop it into my mouth: ‚ÄúPatience.‚Äù Bitter as orange peel, fragrant as zest. And the clock steps forward bashfully‚Äîwithout daring to speak the word ‚Äòmorning.‚Äô I crack the window: the city‚Äôs sweat breathes against my face. My pajama cuffs are still damp‚Äîmy catholic ritual, my symbol of confession. My teeth mark time like a metronome. The coffee pronounces judgment: ‚ÄúYou will live today as well.‚Äù The cigarette seals the decree: ‚ÄúWith the same tirade.‚Äù I sign beneath it: Orca. Once more. For each morning a person bestows a fresh name upon himself. I choose the softest name for my cruelty to myself: Proceed. I proceed‚Äîbecause to remain unfinished is the fossil of perfection, and to be complete is the fair of the ordinary. I love fossils‚Äînot for their fragility, but because they carry the weight of time grain by grain. I add another sip to my weight; the cup grins from the bottom. ‚ÄúGrin,‚Äù I tell it, ‚Äúgrin.‚Äù If God refuses to laugh, at least you do. Perhaps a portion of divine humor hides in the cups: in the dissimilarity of the lip-prints we leave, in the snail-tracks smoke sketches on the ceiling. I am a marine mammal following those orbits: as my name suggests, Orca. I have lost my sea; I took refuge in my room. I swim here‚Äîcoffee waves, ash currents, the coasts of sentences. One day the sea will recede; what you find on the bed will not be my footprints‚Äîbut my words. For I do not walk; I write. And now, before morning has even arrived, let me record this: ‚ÄúOne knows oneself best before dawn.‚Äù Darkness is the courteous state of mirrors; it polishes ugliness, hushes beauty. I love my uncured side: rough, crusted, damp. Whoever you are reading these lines, know that I love you too‚Äîyes, with a prideful love, the sort that enlarges me in the mirror. But the pride of love is better than the humility of hate. To love is to want to remake a thing in your image; I want to remake you in mine: a little dark, a little comic, and a little resilient. I won‚Äôt ring a closing bell; bells are the police of feeling‚Äîthey disperse content. I do not want sirens; I want a drone. Drone is life‚Äôs truest background music. The wind entering through the window begins to drone; the curtain trembles like a tiny stage. This is my applause. No audience, and yet applause. The applause of emptiness is the most honest measure of fullness. Now, with your permission, I‚Äôll take a third sip‚Äîand a fourth breath. For such are rituals: meaningless unless repeated. My meaning grows roots in repetition. My name is Orca. And morning, as yet, has still not come. But I have arrived‚Äîto myself. That will do.",1,1757760710.0,u_Orkuneu,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a down-to-earth guy who‚Äôs navigating a unique living situation right now. For financial and family reasons, I still share a home with my ex-wife but let me be clear: there‚Äôs no romance or intimacy there. We co-parent our kids under the same roof, and that‚Äôs where it begins and ends.

I‚Äôd like to meet one person I can genuinely connect with. Ideally, someone open-minded who understands that life isn‚Äôt always picture-perfect. I‚Äôm not looking to juggle multiple people, just hoping to build something real with the right person. A friends-with-benefits situation could work if that‚Äôs where things start, but if it naturally grows into something deeper, I‚Äôd be more than open to that.

So, I've had this question in mind for quite some time.

We keep hearing all the time that the past doesn't matter but the moment a guy says he has slept with prostitutes, they say the past does matter and more often than not their reasoning is it's because the industry exploits women and then some even go on to say you're effectively buying a person by doing so.

Well, first of all you‚Äôre not buying the person, rather you‚Äôre buying the service they provide. If I hire a bodyguard, I‚Äôm not buying him; I‚Äôm paying for the service.

The point that's made by women is that people shouldn‚Äôt consume these services because there‚Äôs a chance someone involved might have been exploited.

Sure, the industry does exploit women. Not denying that. But first, that doesn‚Äôt mean every person someone sleeps with was trafficked or exploited. Most high end-workers in fact do it willingly. And second, this logic applies to almost every industry.

By that logic, someone watching a Hollywood movie with child actors is also an accomplice to exploitation, since Hollywood is infamous for preying on kids in the industry. Or what about the depressed, underpaid workers mining lithium in Africa? The very lithium that powers the phone we‚Äôre using right now? Or what about the child labor and extreme exploitation that's rampant in West Africa‚Äôs cocoa farms? 

So, do you refuse to consume Hollywood films? Do you refuse to use a phone? Do you refuse to drink coffee and eat chocolate because India in an importer? Do you personally check to make sure you‚Äôre not complicit in any way? Do you refuse to avail these services or goods?  Of course not.

Have we stopped caring about men? Do we not realise that the overwhelming majority of such people are men, some of them are just boys?

Dear women, do you care about the exploitation of those men?

Ig no.

Why? Because those services give you value, they entertain you, and you don‚Äôt care enough about the exploitation behind them. Which makes it seem like your standards aren‚Äôt really rooted in morality, they just apply selectively, wherever it feels convenient.

This reasoning behind rejecting someone for sleeping with a prostitute isn't sound if you believe past doesn't matter.

It seems to me that it creates a sense of undesirability in some women, because they no longer feel as important cz the sex that once gave them power can‚Äôt be used that way anymore.

Either the past matters or it doesn't.

Looking forward to hearing your opinions.  Be respectful to each other guys!",52,1757760343.0,AskIndianMen,72,0.72,False

But my work day is 8 hours. If I take a 5 min break each hour, I end up taking 40 minutes breaktime in total. Which means in reality I will work only around 7 hours.

So I usually don‚Äôt take many breaks. Bathroom breaks sure. But coffee breaks? no. Going for a short walk outside? no. I mainly just sit at my computer and try to power through.

Why I am posting this is because sometimes after concentrating at a problem for a long time, like 2 hours, my brain feels like it‚Äôs going to explode and I really long to take a break and take a walk or something. But I don‚Äôt want to have to work overtime to make up for it, or feel like I am ‚Äùstealing time‚Äù I should have been working.

edit: it‚Äôs also not that I think my employer will freak out if I take breaks. My coworkers don‚Äôt seem to care too much to work exactly 8 hours a day. It‚Äôs just that this is unwritten rules, which I, as autistic, struggle with, because it‚Äôs always gonna be ‚Äùuse common sense/your own judgement‚Äù.  I struggle here because I get paid and don‚Äôt know the exact unwritten expectation are that I do for that money. 

At my unpaid internship I did not struggle because I did not get paid so I felt I could do pretty much what I wanted. Or when I worked for friends it was also more chill because I knew my friends would not give a shit about time spent/breaks taken as long as the job got done, and they also cared about me having a good time.

There is a guy from my work that I know for a year and a half. He was in my same office floor but in different projects. Since Christmas I noticed him more, he stared at me and I started to look back at him more or even search for him. At this period of time, I was in a relationship so I tried to keep distance and not engage in conversation. 

This guy is Polish so his way of acting for me is quite different to what I am used to. We saw eachother every day on the commuting to work and we both took the same tram. I felt as if there was a world of non spoken things between us because the look in our eyes were quite intense. My now ex boyfriend and I broke up due to distance, but still we love each other even though we‚Äôre not together. Soon after this the project got cancelled and I thought this guy and I would never see each other again, so I decided to do something. I had a house viewing and knew he lived close to this house so decided to ask him for directions. This was my first time approaching him directly. He was super helpful and friendly and offered his help to go with me to the visit. I ignored this question but deep down wanted to go with him just to get rid of the fantasy that my brain created and realising he was a normal guy.

The day came, and he didn‚Äôt speak to me, so when I had to take the tram back home to the house viewing I decided to skip 2 trams hoping he would appear, and eventually he did just when I decided to drop this insane idea and just go home. He came straight to me with our other coworker, and asked me if I was going. This time I accepted. We had to take the same bus home so he came to the house visiting with me. In the way to the viewing we had the most intense conversation ever, we shared a lot of things about ourselves, traumas, family member lost, fears, politics, religion (he‚Äôs very catholic & I am an atheist), physics‚Ä¶ and I felt as if we were both waiting for a year for this moment. 

Soon enough we were talking daily night and day, he asked me to go on walks with him after work, and we got to know each other quite well to the point we know things about each other nobody else‚Äôs know. He‚Äôs a complex man, and he always mentions that I am a ‚Äúyoung attractive woman‚Äù but I feel like he‚Äôs defending himself. He admitted to look at me and remember many small details of all this past year, my clothes, my style, seeing me everyday and having a quite vivid picture of me during this last Christmas. Basically, all of his free time he spends it with me, and so do I. We talk every day, take coffee go on walks and on weird places like graveyards. He has severe trauma since he lost his dad and the whole war situation and I know one side of him wants a family and kids (not that I want this with him just describing) and another one wants to just go to the war area and pretty much stay there. We created a complex bond and I feel how he looks intensely at me sometimes, he cares about me buys me medicine or random things, ask me for my food‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been in his house and he has been in my one and nothing happened at all. More than some jokes about me being attractive. It‚Äôs been 3 months now and I don‚Äôt know if he actually likes me or if he wants to have a non physical/intimate relationship with me. Is this normal in the polish culture?? 

Am I just his friend?? I am so confused. I feel like he‚Äôs avoidant when it comes to feelings and when the conversation gets too close to that he changes the subject, but he also starts some deeper conversations. What should I believe out of all this? Will he stay like this forever? ",1,1757759471.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1nfu50z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nfu50z,Kharmah Qahwa by Al Haramain (Hyderabad),"Recently I got my hands on Al Haramain's Khamrah Qahwa (Hyderabad). I hadn't smelled the OG Khamrah Qahwa before I bought this, but the price was too good to pass up: ‚Çπ400 for 50ml and ‚Çπ800 for 100ml.

Yeah, the 50ml comes in a plastic bottle, which had me a little worried (I‚Äôll try to decant in a glass bottle later), but the 100ml is a legit glass bottle, which you can see in the third pic.

The first spray is a bit of a booze bomb with a touch of cinnamon and little coffee. After about 10-15 minutes, though, it settles down into this super sweet, cozy scent that smells incredible. The dry down is where it gets really good, with prominent notes of coffee, vanilla, and a gourmand richness. It smells so good I almost want to drink it.

One day I wore this to a party, spraying 5-6 times, and I was shocked by the performance. My friends kept asking me what I was wearing. For a cheapie, this thing projects like crazy for about two hours, and people can still smell it from half a foot away for 6-7 hours. I even had it on a sweatshirt, and the scent was still there two days later.

I was so impressed that I started wondering if the OG Khamrah Qahwa smelled this good. So I ordered a decant from Sovereign Scents to compare. When it arrived, I did a side-by-side test, and I was honestly blown away. The clone is an almost perfect match, I'd say a good 98% identical. I think the booziness is slightly more in OG Khamrah Qahwa

Honestly, if you're thinking of buying Khamrah Qahwa, don't spend 2.5k on the OG. For 2.5k, you could buy other solid all-rounder perfume, and since Khamrah Qahwa is a winter/cold weather scent that you'll only wear occasionally, I'd say a decant or OG partial bottle or 50ml from Al Haramain is more than enough.But if you want that fancy glass bottle, the 100ml is still a steal at 800 INR.",4,1757759432.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,5,0.83,False
1nfu4sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1nfu4sm/first_part_time_job/,First part time job,"So like I recently had my first part-time job n I did 4 days in the span of 2 weeks as a barista. It was a family-owned cafe n they said they‚Äôd pay me in cash. At first, the owner‚Äôs niece told me I‚Äôd get paid for training too, so I did 2 days of training.

On the 3rd day it was mad rush hour n I had to do everything ‚Äî serving, cashier, washing all the dishes coz the dishwasher was broken, plus making coffee n serving customers. On top of that, the owner‚Äôs wife had such a bad attitude. She would literally shout at me in front of customers over the pettiest things. Like one time I asked a customer to remind me of their order coz I had so many to remember n was lowkey confused, and later she told me off. Overall it was just a terrible vibe.

Then recently I found out the cafe closed down coz it wasn‚Äôt making profit. When I reminded them about my pay (which was only ¬£165 btw, literally just minimum wage for a 17 y/o), they suddenly switched up n said they don‚Äôt pay for training at all n apparently ‚Äútraining takes 5 days.‚Äù

Honestly I feel so betrayed. This was my first job n I was so excited to get my first paycheck, but instead it felt like being last-minute excuses n disappointment. Guys what should I do coz they are offering me diff job at their other restaurant.

I am 52 kg at 16, 5‚Äô7

I get exhausted half way while eating lunch it‚Äôs fucking brutal, it‚Äôs just so painful trying to eat so much fucking food. My stomach hurts after a meal. I can barely stand up after a meal too but this all will change for sure
