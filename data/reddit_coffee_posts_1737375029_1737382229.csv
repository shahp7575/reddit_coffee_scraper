1i5qx4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/visualsnow/comments/1i5qx4y/positive_visual_snow_update/,Positive Visual Snow Update,"It has been about a year since my diagnosis and I am overall feeling as good as I can be with my VSS. I had made a post about 10 months ago detailing positive progress which was a follow up to my original post here prior to diagnosis. Being that I now have some time under my belt I wanted to go over some observations I have made with my doctor. 

**What triggered my visual snow?**
The original answer to this question is migraine with aura as in the year leading up to the development of VSS I was having one or two episodes a month. However since I have developed VSS I no longer get the auras anymore, just an occasional migraine once a month or two months. 

I had also observed that my VSS appeared to be far worse when I would be drinking Monsters and Redbulls each day. Once I had stopped drinking these I noticed an immediate relief in my VSS. If I drink something with high caffeine content, like a coffee, I do not see my VSS rise to a degree like it does when drinking energy drinks and therefore when discussing with my doctor we believe it could be (as stated in the rules also correlation doesn't equal causation) due to the B6 and B12 content that is 300% the daily limit that an individual should consume. 

**My Treatment**
Quick background on my medication regimen prior to VSS. I have been on Zoloft since I was a teenager, Buspar, Prazosin, Wellbutrin (this is a newer addition so I can cut down on Zoloft), oxybutynin, and Topamax. I have generalized anxiety disorder and chronic depression also. Could these have aided in the development of my VSS? Yes however my neurologist believes it was the migraine with aura specifically. 

Topamax is what I take to help with the afterimages caused by VSS. Prior to this my life was extremely difficult, I couldn't even open a curtain without feeling my eyes strain themselves and getting after images for 10+ seconds at a time. However with Topamax it has cut down the amount of time I have after images to 3 seconds or less in many cases and I don't experience eye strain more than the normal person would. It has really given me my life back. 

Overall I wanted to post this here and continue to post positive updates as I know it is easy to feel very lost, depressed, and alone when having VSS. While it is scary and can be debilitating to have I figure that if I can share a positive experience where there aren't many that hopefully it will bring some light to our community :)",1,1737382081.0,visualsnow,0,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1737381754.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

1i5qs67,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1i5qs67/staying_motivated_in_the_mundane/,Staying Motivated in the Mundane,"Ah, the slow grind of building a business. It’s like trying to make a gourmet meal with a microwave – sometimes you just have to make do with what's available, and those slow or repetitive phases can feel like the culinary equivalent of boiling water for hours. But fear not! I've got a few strategies up my sleeve to help you keep that motivation bubbling like a pot of simmering sauce. 

1. **Set Micro-Goals:** Picture this: you’re on a long road trip, and rather than fixating on the 500 miles to your destination, you celebrate every hundred-mile marker. It's the same with your business. Break down your larger goals into bite-sized chunks. It could be as simple as sending five emails a day, posting on social media, or making one new connection. Each small win is a reminder that you’re moving forward, even if it feels like molasses.

2. **Create a Routine:** You know how coffee is like a hug in a mug? A routine is like that cozy, warm drink for your productivity. Establish a daily schedule that allows you to carve out time for specific tasks. This not only creates a sense of rhythm but also helps you avoid the temptation of binging on Netflix instead of taking care of business – believe me, those cliffhangers can suck you in like a black hole.

3. **Celebrate the Wins (No Matter How Small):** I’m talking confetti, folks! Okay, maybe not literal confetti (unless you’re into that kind of thing), but take a moment to acknowledge each achievement. Finished tweaking that marketing strategy? Grab a treat. Completed a week of social posts? Watch that episode of your favorite show guilt-free. Celebrating the small victories reminds you that every step counts, and soon enough, you'll look up and see how far you've come.

4. **Find Your Squad:** You ever notice how a group of friends can make even the lamest activities fun? Grab your accountability buddies and share your struggles and triumphs along the way. Whether it’s a weekly check-in or a casual coffee chat, having that support system makes the journey a whole lot less lonely and injects some much-needed energy into the grind.

5. **Stay Inspired:** Sometimes you need a little external motivation to kick your own butt. Read inspiring books, listen to podcasts, or follow industry leaders on social media. This not only opens your mind to new ideas but also helps you to remember that every entrepreneur has faced those mundane phases. They all have stories – some are hilarious; others are downright cringe-worthy – but all of them remind us that perseverance is key.

6. **Reflect and Pivot:** There’s wisdom in reflection, and trust me, it’s not just for yoga classes. Make it a habit to regularly pause and reflect on what’s working and what isn’t. Maybe what you thought was a great marketing idea is really just a long walk off a short pier. A quick pivot can transform those stagnant periods into bursts of creativity and progress.

7. **Remind Yourself of Your ‘Why’:** Take a deep breath and recall why you started this journey in the first place. Was it to be your own boss? Create something beautiful? Serve your community? Keep that ‘why’ front and center, like a banner at a parade. When the going gets tough, circling back to your core purpose can reignite that internal fire and propel you forward.

Building a business is a marathon, not a sprint, and those slow and repetitive phases? They’re just the nature of the beast. It’s an opportunity to dig deeper, refine your skills, and remain faithful to the calling you’ve received. Remember, even in the mundane, God has a plan for your journey. And with a little patience and perseverance, you just might find unexpected blessings even on the slowest of days.

Mid November last year, I met the most incredible woman. I'm 37M and she's 36. We instantly clicked and felt this deep connection that neither of us had ever felt before. I have been in multiple relationships in my life, have also been engaged and never felt anything like this. 

My last few relationships were very toxic, including my engagement. I was really hurt in all of them. This was different. This was the first time in my life I felt truly safe with someone. I felt this sense of peace and calmness from this woman that I've never felt before. She absolutely loved everything about me, and it felt amazing. I felt seen, heard and understood for the first time in my life. 

She's honestly everything I've ever wanted in a partner. She's extremely sweet, caring, loving, kind, empathetic, bubbly, incredibly intelligent,  hard working, very family oriented and has the same sense of humour as me. 

We both felt this sense of familiarity, as though we've known each other forever. It's so strange. Things moved so quickly, and I found myself acting out of character and so was she. The things we would say to each other, the way we acted around each other, etc.

We would spend hours on the phone together and chat daily, whether it was via text or phone call.

I was starting to feel crazy as it felt like I was falling in love with someone I barely knew, and I could sense the same from her. 

Around Christmas Day, she experienced a family issue that she wouldn't tell me about, but it left her feeling extremely upset. When I tried to talk to her about it, she just said she couldn't talk about it and wasn't ready to talk about it yet. The only person she had spoken to about it was her brother. I respected this and just let her know I'm here to listen whenever she's ready.

I could see she was falling into depression, but she kept saying how talking to me and being with me felt so good and made her forget about everything. She did mention a few times that she felt bad because she wasn't giving me the best version of herself and this isn't like her. She said it feels like meeting the right person at the wrong time. Despite this, things were really good between us until a week ago. 

She was feeling really down that day. We went out later that evening but the vibe wasn't the best, but she was still really sweet with me. I took her out to dinner followed by coffee and a walk along the beach. 

Later that evening when I got home, I felt crap coz I felt like I didn't do enough to lift her mood so I texted her. We texted back and forth and she mentioned how she still feels so bad and she can't explain it. She said how it's eating her up inside coz she wants to give me the world but she can't. She said she realised she wasn't mentally able to give me herself at this point and that she realised that after that night. I asked if that meant she wanted space from me. She said she didn't really want to but maybe it was for the best. 

I tried to let her know that it wasn't affecting me and that I was happy to have her in my life, but she decided that space was for the best so that she could sort herself out. I didn't want to push it so I told her I respected her wishes and to take all the time she needs and that I'm here when she's ready to talk again. 

Fast forward to Monday, I sent her a text with a picture of a coffee cup with latte art with her name, something I did for her often as she loved them, and I added the caption 'thinking of you'.

She liked the message and replied 'there's so much I want to say but can't'. I asked her why, and she said that things were getting worse and she didn't want to be wasting my time by me hanging around waiting for her.

I sent her a message back saying that if she believes I'm the right guy for her then there is no wrong time because the right person will meet you in the midst of chaos and sit with you through it. I told her I was right where I want to be and didn't want to go anywhere. 

I told her that I'm happy to support her in any way she needs and if that means giving her space to process her emotions then that's totally fine, I was simply checking in to let her know I was thinking of her. 

She replied, 'I appreciate these messages and you more than you know but I can’t comprehend processing any feelings while I know you are giving me space and waiting for me.. which is a  vicious cycle of guilt and selfishness and I seriously don’t think I can handle that right now. Please don’t hold back and moving on would be the right thing to do. If our paths cross and it’s meant to be.. it’s meant to be🌹'

I'll be honest this response hurt me a lot, but I simply replied with:

 'That's fair enough, I respect how you feel.Whatever you're dealing with, I genuinely hope it all works out and you find yourself again. If you need anything I'm a phone call away 🌹'

It's now 1 week later and there has been no contact since. I'm honestly struggling really bad. We still have each other on socials, so I don't think she's ghosting me and I'm fairly sure she's being genuine, but it's honestly hard to know what's true or isn't anymore. My past experiences haven't been the best. Tired of getting my heart broken.

I feel silly for even making this thread as I only knew this girl for 2.5 months, but I can't help it. She genuinely made me feel more in that time than anyone else has in any length of time. The connection we shared during this time was incredible. I had the best new years I've ever had with her. Is it normal to be grieving this bad over such a short encounter?

Normally I would simply let this go and move onto the next, but I can't this time. My heart is honestly in pieces and my mind is struggling to come to terms with how we can be so close one minute, speaking every single day, can't get enough of each other, to not speaking at all. It's so jarring and I'm sitting here wondering what the fuck I've experienced. Did I get love bombed? Possible avoidant? I just can't fathom willingly walking away from someone completely if I felt they were perfect for me like she claims, regardless of what I was going through. That's just me.

Im giving her space as she requested, but would it be a bad idea to send a short message checking in with her in a week or 2? Something simple like, 'Just wanted to check in on you. I hope you're doing okay. You're in my prayers always' (I'm a religious person just FYI).

I'm not lazy and I also don't like to cram so sometimes if It's super important I just force myself to do the work. I dont want to stay like this, It makes me feel very lazy and I feel like im cramming.

Today I have little school work to do but it's not that important. I was thinking of taking neat notes since my last notes are super Messy but still readable and organize. But while writing I feel very tired and my eyes are super heavy, I even have a large cup of coffee with me but I still decided to go to bed early thinking It's good for me since I haven't gotten any complete 8 hour sleep

Even Last week I drank 3 cups of coffee a day just to stay awake. Since I have alot of school works to do in the week

Someone please help me, I still want to put effort in everything and make every minute productive and worth it. Id like every plan I make to succeed🙏

Recently had a trip with my parents to Udaipur from 12th to 15th January and want to thank this subreddit for helping with all the questions and suggestions. Searched for some keywords and posted questions for what i couldn't find.

My first question was whether we should come by road via car or by train and take 2-wheelers to roam around and as people suggested it would be too cold to ride 2-wheelers, so car would be a much better option just don't take car in old city. Just park somewhere and go by auto and walk around.

So below is my (really long and detailed) itinerary to guide future travelers as my return gift to the subreddit.

**Day 1 :**

We started our road journey from Vadodara to Udaipur at 5 AM and visited Shree Shamlaji Vishnu Temple on the way.

Reached and checked in at the hotel at 1 PM.  
(Hotel Lotus Inn - triple deluxe room containing 1 double bed and 1 single bed to accommodate 3 of us which costed us 1k per night on Agoda which is on the cheaper side as it was little far from main city and lakes but as we had whole day to admire the view it wasn't needed to book a lakeside hotel for 3x the price. Good service and cleanliness. Didn't try their food, also the lift was not working but the room attendant helped with the luggage)

Then we headed to grab parathas at Sai baba paratha centre at gulab bagh road. (tried aloo, paneer and pizza ones and found the aloo parathas the best from the lot)

Then we visited Jagdish mandir but it was closed so we went to the city palace museum. (Ticket charges are 50 INR for entry and 400 INR for Museum per person. Museum was too long so I'm not that into history so got bored walking but there were some great spots with views to get your pictures clicked.)

Walking past city palace we reached Rameshwar ghat for a boat ride to Jagmandir island. (Ticket price - 600 INR before 2 PM and 800 INR after 2 PM per person. We Wanted to catch the sunset on boat so timed our ride accordingly around 5:30 PM but the ticket window closes at 5 PM but as it was Sunday and there were many people came after 5 PM and requested officials for tickets, they agreed to reopen the ticket window for us to capture the spectacular view of sunset on a boat ride.) Then we had the pleasure of attending sandhya aarti at jagdish mandir.

Had a dinner at Restaurant Harigarh. (For a lakeside table waiting was around 45 mins so we chose to opted for a table little back. Ordered laal maas and kadaknath murgh. Overall a decent experience.)

**Day 2 :**

Caught sunrise at Bahubali hills. Amazing view and definitely recommend visiting early in the morning to catch the sunrise here. (Check the sunrise and sunset times in udaipur for better planning of exact times to visit places. Ticket - 20 INR / person. You can get Tea, Coffee and Meggie on top, we tried the black tea which was really well made.)

Visited Maharana Pratap Kendra afterwards. (Opening time - 9 AM, Ticket - 140 INR per person. They have guide service who will take you to the story of maharana pratap and the war of haldi ghati with the statues in the museum, you can skip the animation, light and projector shows as they are the same stories explained by the guide. You can climb to the statue of maharana pratap on the opposite side which is included in the ticket or also take a golf cart at the price of 50 INR per person. We skipped the statue as it was getting late.)

Then we went to shilpgram which was skippable. (Ticket - 60 INR / person, some cultural shows, camel ride and sculpture gallery in a small village like setting. Nice to have some different experience from the city.)

Went to neemach mata mandir via ropeway. (Ropeway Ticket - 185 INR / person, nice view of fateh sagar lake from the top.)

Had lunch at raaj bagh restaurant and it was the best food experience of our trip. (As it was a daytime we got the lakeside table easily, ordered janglee maas and laal maas with beers. Definitely recommended.)

Wanted to visit saheliyon ki bari and nehru garden island but they were closed due to maintenance for at least next six months.

Then we visited to sajjangarh biological park (Nice zoo, Ticket - 43 INR / person, electric car price - for 3 person - 735 INR but we found other 3 person to share the car so it costed us 945 INR for 6 person. Go for the electric car as it is around 4 KM walk. Skippable as nothing is new, you can see the same animals in every zoo, rather go for jawai leopard safari near udaipur.)

Caught the sunset at Sajjangarh monsoon palace. (Ticket - 177 INR /person and 330 INR for car. The road is very steep and sharp turns so if you are not that great of a driver rather choose share cars which will cost you 120 INR / person. Decent place with good sunset point. Not worth the hassle and ticket price. You can skip it.)

Visited Under the sun aquarium. (Ticket - 160 INR /person, Good for children otherwise skippable)

Dinner at khamma ghani restaurant. (Got a rooftop table with the view of lake. Ordered mewari murgh dhungar and mutton biriyani. Taste and service was great. Recommended.)

**Day 3 :**

We started this day with shopping and street food.  
Tried dal kachori at JMB, Jodhana but found dal kachori and chaat at pratap chaat the best.  
The pyaaz kachori at JMB however was better than jodhana.  
Asked in the subreddit for the best ghever place and got recommended jodhana and vasudev misthan bhandar. Apt recommendation as I found ghevar at Jodhana the best, vasudev's ghever was also really good but JMB's ghever was the worst.  
Also the jalebi at jodhana was delicious.  
Raju ki rabdi was really good at jagdish road.

Visited hathipole market for shopping but was not worth it, found jagdish chowk market much better, Got leather wallet and women purses at great prices.

Visited gangaur ghat and bagore ki haveli. (Ticket - 60 INR /person - spots with great view to click pictures, cultural shows happen in night which we were not interested.)

Royal Cenotaphs was closed for visitors.

Had lunch at chahappan bhog. (Ordered kair sangri with bajra and makkai rotis. Rotis were great but we didn't like the kair sangri. Good restaurant though.)

Reached karni mata ropeway at 4 PM and took a token for a private ropeway car. (As waiting time was less in private one, got the ropeway after 1 hour of waiting. Visited temple then I went to the city wall view point to get the 360 degree view of the city. The main entrance was closed but people went by crossing the railing, the path is risky but the view is definitely worth it. The best place to catch the sunset view in the city.)

The return from ropeway also had a long waiting time. As we got exhausted we decided to order biriyani from biriyani by kilo to our hotel. Also tried local Rajasthani whiskeys (Maharani Mahansar - somras and sahi gulaab). Somras was okayish but sahi gulaab was really great. Got them from the daruwala mall at the entrance of Udaipur from highway at MRP. Good mall with great collection.

**Day 4 :**

Went to nathdwara for shreenathji darshan. (Car is not allowed to enter the premises so you will have to pay 50 INR for parking and you will have to take rickshaw which will cost 100 INR to go to temple and 100 INR to return to parking. The temple timing is very tricky we reached at 9:45 AM but the temple was closed and was to reopen at 11:15 AM so we did shopping for a while and headed to the line to visit the temple.)

Then we went to eklinglji temple which is 30 minutes from nathdwara and is open from 10:30 AM to 1:30 PM and reopens at 5 PM. We reached at 1 PM so we had a great darshan during the aarti time. We then visited the saas-bahu temple which was a great spot with minimal public to click pictures. Delwara Jain temple is in the village with narrow roads and nothing special so one can skip it.

Had lunch at Dhabalogy on highway. (Great location and ambience. Ordered Sarso da saag and makke di roti which was served with white makkhan, chhas and dal baati which had punjabi daal. They also serve complimentary papadi with chatnis, ghee and jaggery. Food was really great and must visit during the trip to nathdwara.)

With this amazing trip came to an end.

Thanks everyone who helped me with the recommendations and those who read it all.

Yes they might lose a bit of value with a small dink. But the stress will ruin you faster.

So, you’ve been doing eye exercises, huh?

It’s not just about flexing your eye muscles like you’re prepping for an eyeball bodybuilding competition. No, this is a team sport, folks—blinking, screen breaks, and good sleep are your star players.

Let me tell you something about eye exercises. They’re like those YouTube workouts you do once and then swear you’ll keep up with. You’re rolling your eyes in circles, staring at pencils, and blinking like you’re in a staring contest with a fan. After five minutes, you’re like, “Yep, I’m cured.”

But here’s the kicker—it’s not just the exercises. It’s the blinking. That’s right. BLINKING. Something so basic, you forget to do it when you’re locked in an endless scroll on TikTok. You ever catch yourself staring at your screen so long, your eyes are like, “We’re on strike. Call us when you remember how to hydrate.”


---

Part 2: Screen Breaks: The Unsung Hero

Now, let’s talk about screen breaks. If you’re not taking them, congratulations—you’ve unlocked the bonus round called “Why do my eyeballs feel like sandpaper?” Every expert says, “Take a 20-second break every 20 minutes.” You know who actually does this? Nobody.

Instead, you’re like, “I’ll take a break after this email.” Then three hours later, you’re practically fused to your chair, blinking manually like you’re a malfunctioning robot. But hey, at least your Candy Crush score is stellar, right?


---

Part 3: Proper Sleep: The MVP

And let’s not forget sleep. Oh, glorious sleep. The thing that’s supposed to reset your eyes but usually gets sacrificed because you stayed up binge-watching Netflix. You think your eye exercises are going to fix all your problems when you’re running on four hours of sleep and coffee fumes? Nope. Your eyes are like, “Listen, buddy, we can’t do Pilates when we’re sleep-deprived. Get it together.”


---

Part 4: Signs They’re Working

So how do you know if all this effort is paying off? Simple:

You’re not squinting at your phone like you’re trying to decipher ancient runes.

You can actually tell the difference between a dog and a mailbox at night.

And the big one: You don’t feel like you’ve been staring directly into the sun after a Zoom meeting.


But here’s the thing—eye exercises aren’t magic. They’re more like maintenance. You’re not going to go from “Where’s my prescription?” to “Hawk mode activated” overnight. It’s more like, “Hey, my eyes don’t hate me as much today. Progress!”


---

Part 5: The Power Combo

Now, here’s where the magic really happens: eye exercises PLUS blinking PLUS screen breaks PLUS sleep. Think of it as the Avengers of eye health. Separately, they’re cool, but together, they save the day. You blink to keep your eyes hydrated. You take screen breaks so they can rest. You sleep so they can recover. And then, you do your eye exercises so they stay sharp.

Boom. Balanced as all things should be.


---

Closing: Embrace the Process

So, yes, your eye exercises are working—but only because you’re doing the whole package deal. Keep at it, and one day, you’ll look back and think, “Wow, I can actually read that road sign before I’m right under it.” And if nothing else, at least your eyes won’t feel like two raisins glued to your face.


---

Call to Action

Now tell me—what’s your go-to eye exercise? Are you a pencil pusher? A ceiling-starer? Or do you just count every blink as a win? Let’s hear your hilarious eye care stories in the comments! Who knows, maybe we’ll all end up with 20/20 vision… or at least a good laugh.

Leaving the Discoverer’s hideout was easier than Eastern expected; she mentioned as much as they walked out. 

“We’re not *prisoners*, Eastern.” Selkirk said, swishing her tail, “We can leave whenever we want.”

“But still,” she protested, “I thought Mi’leni would want us to stay.”

“I’m sure she did,” Sel continued, “But unless she puts us under armed guard she can’t *make* us stay.” They walked out into the early morning.

Eastern tried to suppress a yawn as they made their way to the metro station. “Sel, I don’t know about you, but I’m tired. We should rest before we leave.”

She shook her head quickly, her ears moving a split second behind. “No, we can sleep on the ship. We have to go *now.”*

Nick agreed. “Remember, we’re running from Raaden too. If she hasn’t figured out we left by now, she will soon. We should be as far away from Hyacinth as possible when that happens.”

As they moved down-arm they merged with the early morning commuters, and they did their best to be inconspicuous. Just three more commuters going to work, right? Nothing strange about that. Nick tried to ignore his exhaustion headache. It wasn't working.

They rode the metro all the way down to Congregation Square and exited with the throngs of people going to work. As he stepped in public, the scars on the back of his neck hidden under his collar itched. His implants were colored to look like skin, and the blending was admirable, but he still felt exposed walking around. He didn’t feel this way earlier, maybe it was the fact that they were running from both Raaden and Mi’leni that caused him to become acutely aware of how different he felt. 

“Come on, let’s go get a coffee.” He said. “If nothing else, it’ll help keep us awake.” K’laxi can’t drink it, and Eastern didn’t like it, so he wound up being the only one drinking the coffee. Cradling the hot coffee in both hands to warm them - Hyacinth was a controlled environment, but it was also old enough that they adjusted the temperature for Earth based seasons. It was 'winter' and while nobody would die of exposure on Hyacinth, it was still colder than Nick preferred. It never got this cold on Parvati.

Instead of walking aimlessly around Congregation, they found a bench and sat across from a beverage cart which sold beverages of all different kinds, human, k'laxi, Sef, and others. At the sight of it, Eastern and Selkirk went over to get some tea. They returned shortly with their own warm beverages and sipped them, working out their next steps. Maybe he'd gotten away with it. Maybe they actually lost them.

Far in the distance, they heard a siren. It had a piercing, long wail. It sounded mechanical, or was intentionally made to sound that way. As soon as it started, others joined in, making a massive minor chord - a wall of sound that could be heard all through Hyacinth. It was loud and was *worrying*. Nick wasn't the only one who didn't know what it meant, but he was probably one of the few people on Hyacinth who could query a KB real-time and ask what it was. He used the techniques that Queenie taught him and asked.

**Spin Alarm** was what came back. Details, he thought.

A pre-written explanation started coming from the old knowledge base: Hyacinth was so old that it predated gravity manipulation. To get around that unimportant detail, Hyacinth spun so that centripetal force made ersatz gravity. It wasn't gravity, and didn't feel like it; but it was better than nothing. Further down the explanation, there was a link to a selection of very old welcome articles that explained how to deal with centripetal force and what to do about nausea and how most people got over it within the first week of arrival. As soon as humans learned how to manipulate gravity, the leaders spun Hyacinth down and it remained stationary.

Though that didn't mean the spin engines were removed.

They could pivot and move in nearly every direction. On the rare occasions that Hyacinth needed to change position or orbit, they were repurposed. Plus, it was expensive to remove them, and Houndstooth wouldn't spend that kind of money unless they had a good reason.

Just as they did a thousand years ago, the spin engines on High Mars Hyacinth fired. Being a cylinder sixty miles by twenty meant that - at first - other than a low rumble and a jolt, there was no change. After a minute or two, Nick looked up and could see the stars move in between the arms. The ever present crescent of Mars below crept out of the current panel and into the next.

Human balance is sensitive. As soon as the spin started, Nick felt weird. It was like that carnival ride he rode when he visited that fair on Parvati with his parents when he was small. His inner ear argued with his eyes about where 'up' was. He looked down at his coffee, and the liquid in the cup sloshed oddly, and *slightly* start to lean to one side. If it was happening this fast, then the spin engines were thrusting hard. Nick queried the knowledge-base again and it helpfully mentioned that they could thrust at up to ten gees on when set to Emergency Stop. Nick didn't think there was an Emergency Start, but who knows? The KB wasn't sure either.

“Nick, you look lost in thought, and something strange is going on.” Eastern said, patting his shoulder to get his attention.

“What?” He looked up, his concentration broken. “Oh, sorry. I was reading an old knowledge-base. Someone’s fired the old spin engines, that’s what the alarm was signaling and that’s why things feel weird. We’re spinning!”

People staggered, and some fell to their knees. A K'laxi wearing an cleaner’s uniform fell to their knees and vomited. After that, they started a keening wail that Nick had never come out of a K'laxi's mouth before. Selkirk looked up at them, and stood to help, but immediately fell over.

“Sel!” Eastern got on her knees and went over to her. “Are you all right?”

“Here, lay on your back, it’ll help.” Nick helped her roll onto her back. She blinked and looked up at Nick and Eastern.

“Thanks hons, that helps.” She said, and then swallowed hard. “Now I only feel like I’m dying instead of sure of it. Can someone stop the world, please?”

Suddenly there was a lurch, and it felt like the spin engines were going even faster. If someone had overridden their safety, they could thrust higher than their design called for. Someone wanted everyone on Hyacinth to *stop moving.*

Nick heard a rhythmic clanking. He turned his head, and fighting waves of nausea, he saw three Houndstooth ‘Customer Protection Technicians' in powered armor clomp around the square. They had blackened visors, and they carried their rifles in their hands. As they walked, they looked over everyone as a mini drone hovered behind. Through his implants, Nick could feel it scanning, but it hadn't reached them yet. The three of them had to be somewhere else, *now*. If they got to their feet, they’d give themselves away to the CPTs. ""Eastern! Sel!” Nick hissed, “We’ve got CPTs nearby. They have a drone and it's scanning people.”

“Fuck, CPTs?” Selkirk said, weakly. “They really want to catch us then. First they spin Hyacinth to stop everyone moving, and now they bring out the canned mammal to come after us?”

Suddenly, there was a commotion near the K’laxi on the ground, and an odd shout; the CPTs yelled and he could hear their armor clatter as they scrambled. Before Nick could figure out what was going on, there was a deep thump, and he felt a shockwave. Had one of the K’laxi thrown a grenade? He looked up and saw a group of K’laxi wearing a makeshift looking armor rush over to the one on the ground. Two of them were carrying firearms and began shooting at the CPTs. Nick had heard about their civil war, and that there were reports on the news of it being very brutal, but he had no idea that the war had come to Hyacinth. He thought back to how many K’laxi were actually *on* Hyacinth; violence was bound to happen. One CPT activated their assistance siren while the other’s suit screamed for medical attention. A CPT ran over to their downed companion while others were firing back. The weapons’ noise astonished Nick; he never heard gunfire before and it was far louder than media made it seem.

“Psst!"" Nick turned his head, pushed down the wave of dizziness that accompanied it, and saw a woman with her brown hair done up in a tight bun secured by a chopstick, sticking her head out of an opening in a potted tree close by. “Hey fuckfaces! Get over here!”

“Sunny?” Nick couldn’t believe his eyes. “You said you never wanted to see us again.”

“Yeah yeah, we can have the tearful reunion *after* you get away from the canned ham and the K’laxi having a fight.” Next to her a hatch opened, probably for a gardening robot. “Get out of sight you three.”

Without checking to see if the CPTs were busy, and fighting waves of nausea, Nick rolled Selkirk towards the opening under the tree. Eastern saw what he was doing and followed. Gracelessly, he fell down the hatch and landed on his back a couple of meters down, knocking the breath out of him. Before he could get up, Selkirk landed on him. “Sorry Nick,” She managed, weakly. “I just can’t seem to move right now.”

“It’s okay Sel,” Nick grunted, and gently pushed her off of him. “Eastern? Come on down.”

Eastern seemed to have an easier time of things than Nick or Selkirk. She managed to land mostly on her feet, unsteady though they were. 

Nick sat up and tried to push past the dizziness. Next to them was a gardening cart, and Sunny was sitting in the drivers seat, seemingly unaffected by the acceleration. “Get your rears in gears, meatbags. We gotta get you scarce.”

Eastern and Nick lifted Sel onto the cart and laid her on the back, with Eastern sitting next to her. Nick got in the front next to Sunny as the cart took off, groaning and smelling of ozone under the heavy weight.

“Why are you doing this, Sunny?” Eastern said. “Not that we’re not grateful.”

“Yeah, Sunny,” Sel said, and coughed. “You hate us.”

“Yup, I do.” She admitted. “But, I got a visit by a certain AI fucker who said that if I help you three that he’ll ‘put in a good word’ for me at the next parole meeting.”

“You talked to Gord?” Nick said.

“Are there any other ancient, godlike AIs you’re aware of?” She snapped. “Yes, I talked to Gord. He showed me that damn memory cube too and said I was damn lucky he only had the one.” Nick saw her jaw set and she continued to stare straight ahead. “Said he wouldn’t hesitate to ‘back me up’ if I gave him any more shit.” 

“What are you going to do with us?” Eastern asked.

“I’m bringing you to the docking ring at the base of Hyacinth. I happen to know there’s an old Starjumper docked. He’s a mushy old fuck who will do anything for a BI with a sob story and tits.” She looked at Eastern who looked down and went to cover her chest even though she was wearing a shirt. 

“AIs… can…” Eastern began.

“Humans designed us, didn’t they? Makes sense that some of us would want to fuck you. Hell, the way Gord tells it, in the early days that was some of our *only* jobs.” Sunny did not hide her shudder. “Disgusting. All those fluids, all that noise. Far too… squelchy.”

Nick, Eastern, and Selkirk had nothing more to say to that as Sunny drove them through the tunnels, towards the base.",3,1737380233.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

When I was taking Fluxetine, I felt like a golden retriever. Very easy with people, I could socialize with anyone and I was very witty. I felt like my intelligence increased by a lot. Like it enhanced my personality.

I stopped for various reasons, actually mostly because I wanted to continue living cold turkey (if this is the right term), no drugs on the sight of my body. For the next year I felt horrible. I couldn't think straight, memory very bad and the whole socializing thing, gone. I did everything to reverse that (less screening time, exercise, cut off the coffee, all the good things).NOTHING helped.

So I started taking setraline, again under the supervision of a specialist. Things improved,but still, I am not near the level of confidence I had for myself. No deep thinking. No feeling of rewarding. Workouts, talking to strangers and in general things that increased my dopamine levels, now they don't feel the same.

I am afraid that I lost my beautiful and confident self for ever. I was known for how witty and outgoing person I used to be. Now I'm just trying, which I know is a bad thing, struggling to be someone that you are not, but I think somewhere inside me, that extremely mindful person still exists. 

Maybe i just wanted to share some stuff that feel heavy, but any advice is welcomed too.

1i5q46b,https://www.reddit.com/r/QualityQuest/comments/1i5q46b/what_is_the_best_highend_coffee_machine/,What is the best high-end coffee machine?,"When it comes to buying a high-end coffee machine, especially for older individuals who may not be coffee aficionados but still want a quality brewing experience, there are several key factors to consider. A user recently posted a question in an online community, asking for recommendations after their in-laws' Miele espresso/coffee machine kept breaking down. They are looking for a new machine that is simple to operate, grinds the beans automatically, doesn’t require constant cleaning, and can make a variety of drinks, such as espresso, americanos, and regular coffee. With a budget of up to $2,000, the user considered the Jura E6 but was hesitant after reading some negative reviews. In this essay, we’ll explore the factors to consider when choosing a coffee machine for older users and provide recommendations for high-quality, user-friendly machines.

# 1. What Should You Look for in a High-End Coffee Machine for Older Users?

When shopping for a high-end coffee machine for older individuals who aren’t coffee experts, simplicity and ease of use are the most important factors. Here’s what to look for:

* **Ease of Operation**: The machine should have intuitive controls, with simple buttons or touchscreens that don’t require complicated setup. Machines with preset buttons for different drinks like espresso, americano, and coffee are ideal.
* **Automatic Grinding and Brewing**: Since grinding beans manually can be a hassle, look for machines with built-in grinders that allow for easy bean-to-cup brewing. This feature saves time and ensures that the coffee is fresh.
* **Low Maintenance**: Older individuals may not want to spend too much time cleaning the machine. Choose a model with a self-cleaning function, or one that requires minimal cleaning and maintenance.
* **Variety of Drinks**: The machine should be versatile enough to make various coffee drinks, such as espresso, americano, and regular coffee, with an easy switch between modes.
* **Reliability**: Given that the in-laws experienced issues with their previous Miele machine, reliability is a crucial factor. Researching customer reviews and understanding the warranty and support options is important when making a choice.

# 2. Why is the Jura E6 Not the Best Choice?

While the Jura E6 is a popular choice for high-end coffee machines, some users have raised concerns about its performance. Negative reviews highlight issues such as:

* **Inconsistent Quality**: Some customers have reported inconsistent coffee quality or difficulty in adjusting the grind size and strength of the coffee. This may make it a less suitable option for individuals who prefer simplicity and consistency.
* **Cleaning Concerns**: Despite the self-cleaning functions, some users still found the machine to be challenging to maintain, with frequent cleaning required for optimal performance.
* **Price**: While the Jura E6 is within budget, it might not offer the best value compared to other high-end models that provide similar features with fewer complications.

# 3. What Are the Best High-End Coffee Machines for Older Users?

If you’re looking for a high-end coffee machine that is simple, reliable, and provides excellent coffee without requiring constant maintenance, here are some top recommendations:

* **Breville BES870XL Barista Express** The Breville Barista Express is a highly rated espresso machine with a built-in conical burr grinder. It’s easy to use and produces high-quality espresso, americano, and coffee. The machine comes with a steam wand for making lattes and cappuccinos, and its intuitive interface makes it easy for anyone to operate. It’s low maintenance, and while it does require some cleaning, it’s not overly complicated. This machine is well within budget, priced around $700, and is ideal for those who want a quality coffee machine without breaking the bank.
* **DeLonghi Dinamica Automatic Coffee and Espresso Machine (ECAM35020W)** The DeLonghi Dinamica is another excellent choice. This fully automatic machine grinds the beans for you and has multiple drink options, including espresso, americanos, and regular coffee. It features a simple interface with a few buttons for easy selection, and the cleaning process is relatively straightforward with an automatic cleaning function. The Dinamica also includes a milk frother for making lattes and cappuccinos. It is priced around $1,000, making it a good value for its features.
* **Miele CM6350 Coffee Machine** If your in-laws are still fond of the Miele brand despite past issues, the Miele CM6350 is an excellent option. It’s a fully automatic coffee machine that grinds the beans for you, with an intuitive interface and customizable coffee options. It has a milk frother for making lattes and cappuccinos and is designed to minimize the cleaning effort required. Though it’s on the higher end of the budget, it’s well-regarded for its reliability and quality, with a price around $1,500.
* **Saeco Xelsis SM7684/04 Super-Automatic Espresso Machine** Saeco’s Xelsis is a high-end, fully automatic espresso machine that is perfect for those who want a variety of coffee options. It has a built-in ceramic grinder, an easy-to-use touch screen, and a self-cleaning system.

Finding the perfect high-end coffee machine for older users requires balancing simplicity with high-quality performance. It’s essential to choose a machine that is easy to operate, provides a variety of coffee options, and requires minimal maintenance.

Sorry if I’m not doing this right, long time lurker and first time poster but I need help understanding if I am TA here. 


This is going to be a long and waffly one, I do apologise in advance.

Around 10 years ago I was seeing a guy who l worked with. It ended horribly after three months as he went behind my back and got together with a girl he was seeing previous to me. Even though we'd only been dating a short time, safe to say I was absolutely devastated.

The girl he left me for was constantly in and out of his DMs when we were together, even though he made a few attempts to back off. He is equally to blame in the cheating scenario though, this I understand.

Flash forward to now, after being in a somewhat healthy, loving long term relationship for 5 years, I found myself single as of January last year. I followed my ex on social media and to my surprise, he sent me a message and we started chatting. Things were pleasant so we decided to meet up, for a walk and a coffee. I realised I still had some feelings for him after this, and communicated this to him. We still chatted occasionally after this, but the texts got shorter, and he eventually ignored me for a few days and told me that he suspected this and it made him feel anxious, that he didn't feel the same. I was upset, but I told him I would leave him alone. This was around spring.



Fast forward to December, I reached out to him again. I'd had a couple of drinks, so told him he looked good. We message back and forth, and he indicated he would be keen to meet to hook up. I thought about it for a bit and agreed. He said he wanted to discuss boundaries when I went round. He told me he doesn't want a relationship, and that his main boundary is that he does not want to text me outside of meeting up, as that feels like too much of a commitment/something you do in a relationship. I agreed to this but felt a little uncomfortable. We've met now 5 times, I will go over and we'll sleep together and I'll usually stay and chat/cuddle for a couple of hours after.

We were due to meet one night but he cancelled because he said he wasn't feeling well mentally health wise. I said I understood. I text him the next day and proposed coming round with some booze, snacks and my Wii and we could play some games and chill. I really was not expecting him to agree to this - if I can't even text him to ask how his day is, how is essentially having a night like that going to go down? He agreed to it though. We had a lovely night, but the topic of relationships came up again and I told him I really cared about him. I told him I was confused about being disregarded, because we get on so well.

He got very annoyed and mentioned stuff about us being 'too similar’, which again was all so confusing, and he didn't really elaborate.

I left in the morning and all was well. He was doing something with a friend later that day that I have been interested in getting involved in, but know no one who would be interested in doing this, so I texted him later on in the afternoon asking if we could do the activity some time. I didn't hear from him until the next day, where he was really curt and told me that I was not respecting his boundaries and that I needed to back off. I apologised and tried to clarify if this meant whatever we were doing was finished, but he said he will get in touch, he just needs space. He also mentioned that we would talk about the activity I asked him to do when he saw me next, so I don't think that suggestion was met with an 'absolutely not! I got the text in work and got teary, I wasn't expecting to feel this way at all.

I've got myself into a really shit position with this, and I know it's my fault. I don't understand what I did wrong in the past to make him feel or act this way. I want to respect his boundaries and make him feel safe. But I feel wildly hurt about a couple of things. I don't want a relationship right now, but I'm open to seeing how things go. Go on a few dates, hang out. If it works out, it works out. If it doesn't, it doesn't. I guess my dilemma is, are these boundaries reasonable? I feel like I have absolutely no agency whatsoever, and I'm so confused because we get on so well in person, and the night we spent together was really lovely and did not at all feel like a casual hookup. 

The lines are so blurry and I feel like I'm being punished. I know I'm really just punishing myself at this point by still holding out hope.
Should I just be patient? I'd appreciate advice from guys who have maybe felt the way he does before. I am 32F, he's 31M.",1,1737379564.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

# PROGRESS

*Kura wanders around a classroom, observing the students sitting in front copying what’s on the blackboard while the teacher went to the bathroom.*

**Kura:** *""This place seems depressing.""* *She comments in a melancholic tone.*

*Kura hears a commotion at the back of the room and walks over. In that corner, no one is copying from the blackboard. Instead, they’re talking nonstop, including Gutsu, who seems to be very sleepy.*

**Miyuki:** *""I-I’m serious! Gutsu stole more than 10,000 yen from me! Y-you have to believe me!""* *Miyuki says, desperate for someone to believe her story.*

**Isao:** *""Give it a break, Miyuki! Who’s going to believe you? You don’t even have any evidence!""* *Isao retorts, lightly pushing the girl back.*

*The students at the back laugh at Miyuki's story.*

**Gutsu:** *""This just sounds like a failed attempt to get 10,000 yen for free, Miyu. Why would I steal from you in the first place?""* *He says, laughing. Inside, he just wants to annoy Miyuki even more.*

*Gutsu and Miyuki stare at each other. She clearly looks furious, while he just smiles.*

*At lunchtime, Gutsu sits on the grass, as far away from the other students as possible. He has the Life Ledger on his lap and a mini LCD TV next to him. Kura watches Gutsu from above, noticing the bags starting to form under his eyes.*

**Kura:** *""You look tired.""*

**Gutsu:** *""Well, can you blame me for filling my nights so full?""*

**Kura:** *""What did you do last night?""*

*Gutsu looks at Kura, surprised.* **Gutsu:** *""You don’t remember? I told you my plans.""*

**Kura:** *""I guess I didn’t pay much attention.""*

*Gutsu takes a sip from his energy drink before continuing.*

**Gutsu:** *""Last night I studied how Kira kills.""*

**Kura:** *""Didn’t you say he was killing criminals?""*

**Gutsu:** *""Yeah, but we have to look at HOW and WHEN he kills, instead of just WHO. Nowadays, he's killing criminals minutes after they're shown on the news.""*

**Kura:** *""So that’s why you brought this mini TV.""*

**Gutsu:** *""Exactly. But I noticed something while I was studying yesterday. When Kira started, the times of the killings were different. Based on that, it’s very likely that he’s a student. However, later, the times changed, which makes me think he learned to control when people die.""*

**Kura:** *""Not a bad hypothesis. What are you going to do now?""*

*Gutsu looks at his mini TV, where faces and names of newly arrested criminals begin to appear. He starts writing in the Life Ledger.*

**Gutsu:** *""I’m going to save the criminals as soon as they appear on the news today. After all, I don’t need to write before Kira, just within 20 seconds after him. This will also be an experiment to see if the Life Ledger works when I write before Kira. I think it will.""*

**Kura:** *""But how is saving these criminals going to help?""*

**Gutsu:** *""To confuse L. Kira kills every day, so it’d be odd if criminals stopped dying on random days. L probably already has suspects. I’m doing this to make him question, change his suspects, and, with some luck, arrest the wrong person. Haha! Wouldn’t that be funny?""*

**Kura:** *""I don’t see the humor in someone being falsely accused of murder.""* *She says, in a neutral tone.*

**Gutsu:** *""Wow, you’re really no fun, huh? Go enjoy yourself.""* *He replies, pretending to be irritated, but with a smile.*

*The TV announces more names of criminals, and Gutsu resumes writing.*

***Gutsu: ""This is going to be great. L will definitely wonder why no criminals died today. I’ll make sure to be unpredictable: saving criminals at irregular intervals, between one and five days, to overload L with information. Let’s see how he handles this.""***

*Kura looks around the school yard. She sees Miyuki in the distance, glaring at Gutsu. Kura looks back at him.*

***Kura: ""This kid... Is he naïve or just carefree?""***

***Gutsu: ""Now that I think about it... why did Kira decide to change the timing of the killings? Does he know that L is suspecting him? It's a possibility...""***

*Watari enters the room, this time without any papers in hand.*

**Watari:** *""Ryuzaki. According to the news, none of the criminals shown publicly were killed today.""*

*Soichiro, sitting next to L, stands up, surprised.*

**Soichiro:** *""No criminals died today? Are you sure, Watari?""*

**Watari:** *""I’m sure, Mr. Yagami.""*

**Soichiro:** *""But that doesn’t make sense. Why would Kira stop killing today?""*

***L: ""Great question. It wouldn’t make sense for Kira to stop killing today, unless something happened. Light watched the news today... Could he have decided to take a break? Unlikely. Or maybe he’s trying to prove his innocence? But that would mean Light knows we’re watching him, and he never rearranged his room or looked at the cameras...""***

**L:** *""Better not to jump to conclusions. Let’s wait a few days to gather more information.""*

**8 DAYS LATER**

**L:** *""In the last few days, I’ve reviewed all our audio and video recordings. I’ve done this countless times. The recordings from the Kitamura and Yagami houses revealed... nothing.""* *L speaks as he opens a piece of candy and puts it in his mouth.*

*Soichiro sighs in relief.*

**L:** *""Let’s remove all the cameras and bugs.""* *He chews.*

**L:** *""The criminals stopped dying regardless of whether the Kitamuras or Yagamis watched the news. And the days were random. I compared them with important dates for the suspects, but nothing matched. It doesn’t make sense, since this doesn’t benefit Kira.""*

*L takes a sip of his coffee.*

***L: ""This doesn’t make any sense. It almost makes me think Kira is just a vengeful god, but, well, it’s ridiculous to think that gods need a name and face to kill, and even more absurd to think that they can 'fail' at it. It’s obvious Kira is just someone with a god complex.""***

*L places the cup on the table.*

***L: ""Kira wasn’t having problems killing criminals before, but something changed. Maybe his powers or even another person in his way...""***

**L:** *""Alright, from now on, I want recordings from the cameras in the prisons around the Kanto region.""*

*L looks at Soichiro.*

**L:** *""Can you arrange that, Soichiro Yagami?""*

*Soichiro, surprised, clears his throat before speaking.*

**Soichiro:** *""Ah, yes, Ryuzaki, I can handle that.""*

**L:** *""Great. I want to monitor Kira's actions in real-time...""*

*Gutsu sits on the bed, twirling a pen between his fingers while eating chips. He looks frustrated. Kura is floating in the air, eating grapes that Gutsu had given her. She watches him with a neutral expression.*

**Kura:** *""Something wrong?""*

*Gutsu sighs, closing his eyes.*

**Gutsu:** *""I don’t know what to do. I need to find Kira and L... Only then will I know how to act.""*

*He chews the chip, staring into space.*

**Gutsu:** *""But how? They both must be extremely cautious. I’ve researched a lot, but I haven’t found anything on L. I discovered some suspects for being Kira, but there’s nothing confirming it. It’s not like I can just investigate and question people out of nowhere. And even if I find Kira, all he has to do is write my name in the Death Note, and I’ll die.""*

*Kura grabs another grape without changing her expression.*

**Kura:** *""But you can write your own name in the Life Ledger.""*

**Gutsu:** *""Yeah, but then Kira will realize something’s off and never trust me.""*

*Gutsu lies down on the bed, staring at the ceiling with a defeated look on his face.*

**Gutsu:** *""Trust... That’s all I need.""*

*The silence fills the room. The only sound is the bag of chips.*

**Kura:** *""Do you know why we shinigamis kill humans?""*

*Gutsu stays silent for a moment before looking at her.*

**Gutsu:** *""Why?""*

**Kura:** *""Because we’re afraid of dying. When we kill a human, the remaining lifespan of that person is added to our own time. But that doesn’t work when a human kills another using a Death Note.""* *She speaks in a more melancholic tone now.*

**Gutsu:** *""And... what’s your point?""*

**Kura:** *""I can give you shinigami eyes, Gutsu.""*

*Gutsu’s eyes widen for a moment as he sits up in bed.*

**Gutsu:** *""Shinigami eyes?""*

**Kura:** *""Our eyes are different. I can see not only your name, but also the remaining time of life floating above your head. You can have them too, if you want.""*

**Gutsu:** *""I... don’t see how this will help me.""*

**Kura:** *""With shinigami eyes, there are only two situations in which you cannot see someone’s remaining time: your own, and the time of other humans who possess a Death Note.""*

*Gutsu’s eyes widen for a moment.*

**Gutsu:** *""I-Is that serious? I can... tell who has a Death Note just by looking at them?""*

**Kura:** *""Yes. But there’s a price... Normally, I would charge more, but... you intrigue me.""*

**Gutsu:** *""What’s the price?""*

**Kura:** *""Give me 40% of your remaining lifespan, and the shinigami eyes will be yours. Deal?""*

*Gutsu stares at Kura for almost a minute... then, he smiles.*

**Gutsu:** *""I’d even let you charge the full price, Kura... Haha!""*

*He laughs, standing up from the bed.*

**Gutsu:** *""I have no reason to want to live long in this shitty world. If I can gain an advantage and end this faster, it’s like killing two birds with one stone!""*

*He laughs again.*

**Gutsu:** *""Let’s go, Kura. I accept!""*

*Kura remains silent, though internally, she’s surprised.*

**Kura:** *""...You accept your death so easily... But will you accept what comes before it?""*

*Gutsu doesn’t respond; he just laughs. For the first time, Kura feels curiosity and intrigue for a human.*

**Kura:** *""...You’re interesting...""*

**Gutsu:** *""And you’ll see something even more interesting! I promise you that!""*

**Yume Road, 33**

*Light walks back home with a shopping bag. Earlier, he watched the news, memorizing the names and faces of criminals. Now, away from L’s cameras, he begins writing the names in the Death Note. Ryuk flies beside him.*

*While writing, something catches his attention. The same criminal was shown both yesterday and today on the news. Light notices this because the name of this criminal was already written in the notebook.*

***Light: ""What?! If the name was already written, this criminal should’ve died from a heart attack! I didn’t write wrong. It’s exactly the same as what was shown on the news. What’s going on?""***

*Light thinks for a moment.*

**Light:** *""Ryuk, is there any way to avoid being killed by the Death Note?""*

**Ryuk:** *""Look, Light, even we shinigamis don’t know everything the notebook can or can’t do. But I think as long as you write the right name and have the person’s face in mind, the death is guaranteed. I’ve never seen any human escape the Death Note.""*

*Light sighs, frustrated.*

**Ryuk:** *""Hehehe! Don’t tell me you couldn’t kill someone?""*

**Light:** *""L can’t be doing this... It’s impossible and makes no sense. Could there be some other rule or detail about the Death Note I don’t know? Or is it something beyond that?""*

*Light reflects for a few more moments.*

**Light:** *""Anyway, this can wait. I’ve got more important matters to solve now.""*

She also mentioned wanting to do exercises as well, which doesn't sit well with me because she's skipping breakfast.

I feel like the snacks She'd have between lunch and dinner would both be unhealthy and wind up being the same as if sue just had breakfast.

Me and our other cousin didn't trust this advice.She even showed me 3 different screenshots from 3 different tik tokers giving the same advice.

She started it today but I kept telling her that I didn't think this advice she got was healthy. I kept telling her that she needs to have 3 meals each day.

As I mentioned in a comment on Friday despite my GOFL and self care, he could tell something was up and we talked about the date and I told him I didn’t want this to be our anniversary celebration because of the uncertainty around it and he agreed. He actually hadn’t really been thinking of it as the anniversary date so that was helpful information. That was Friday night. I focused on my desires in that conversation around the anniversary and other dates, wanting to feel calm and peaceful and light leading up to it and being able to trust him to handle it and just hop in the car. He understood. I have been having a lot of difficulty with going past just expressing my emotions into expressing my negative thoughts which really just has not been helpful, so there was some of that in that conversation but I managed to reel it in. I expressed fear that I would be getting ready for the date and still not know if it was happening, and he said he would be trying to get childcare on Saturday and would let me know either way Saturday evening.

Side note: ever since the Rebel LD Coach posted here I have had a really hard time doing the skills because, while I can see they work for me, and I notice a difference when I stop, I am angry that LD did not vet potential coaches for having actually good marriages before letting them pay,   (physically abused coaches, seriously?) like how is “fake it till you make it” any better than her old marriage counselor with the bad marriage giving advice? The whole thing has just left a bad taste for me.

Back to the story, I took advice to put my sister on standby to go with me and felt better, Saturday he had to do a long drive in the morning and then I went and did my self care appointments in the afternoon so I was feeling good. In the evening he told me 2 pieces of good news (he always starts with the good news first, lol) and then said that as far as the date goes, I should just go with my sister and he’ll stay with the kids (which is what I thought he would say if it fell through). Then he was quick to want to get my order for Chinese food, lol. I expressed sadness that we wouldn’t be going together and he said we would have other times, and I said I was grateful that he had bought the tickets for me. I asked if no one was available, and he said he didn’t reach out to anyone on Saturday after the long drive, because it seemed too late. Honestly, I wasn’t upset, I was actually relieved that he could finally see how stressful it is to get last minute childcare as I have had to do so often. I was SO HAPPY that I had stuck to my I can’t, because I was able to actually just be calm about the situation and honor his limitation *because I had honored mine*. I have used “I can’t” so far on 3 big things in our relationship since August (I promise you I don’t use it as often as you think I do, 😂) - I can’t cook in a dirty kitchen, I can’t homeschool right now, and I can’t arrange childcare for events he plans - and while I think IHY and SOMP and GOFL make big changes over time, “I can’t” is really where I see seismic shifts quickly, if you are doing the other skills.

Things got derailed though, because my sister had specific accommodations she needed to be able to go (could only eat before the concert but no places were open that early and iffy childcare) and then I tried to get a friend to go who couldn’t and then my mom didn’t pick up and I started feeling angry that even though I wasn’t having to do the childcare, he was still dumping the logistics of making this work with someone else on me less than 24 hours before the concert. I decided to go to sleep because I knew night time conversations always suck. In the morning, I asked to talk and started with a vulnerable pick his brain - “I feel sad and scared and angry. I want to feel relaxed and happy and grateful that you bought me these tickets but I can’t, because you dumped the logistics of this date in my lap at the last minute to plan with someone else, and now I can’t fix it. What do you suggest?” This didn’t quite work (obviously a little harsh) but I find that now when I say “what do you suggest?” he tells me ways to see things differently rather than what I want, which is how can he help fix this? Someone help me workshop another way to say “What do you suggest?” So I pivoted and I tried something new. I was really emotional, on my period, and reaaaaaaaallly close to starting a fight, but didn’t want to. So I started using SFPs to basically just say the opposite of what my brain was thinking - I am anxiously attached so my brain gets very negative and dramatic during fights. I started just saying what I wanted him to be telling me and it was practically like hypnosis! (BTW, I’m contradicting *my* negative thoughts, I’m not saying something that is the opposite of what *he’s* saying).

“You love me.” - “Yes”
“You want to fix this for me so I can have a great time with my sister.” - “Yes”
“You care for me and love to help me and you want me to be happy and relaxed.” - “Yes”
“You are sorry that you didn’t get childcare sooner.” (He fought back on this one) “I DID start early enough on getting childcare.”

I started getting derailed from SFPs at this point and saying when I would have started and he said, “this isn’t helpful,” and I caught myself and said “You’re right, I’m sorry this isn’t helpful,” and then went straight back into SFPs and everything got better. 😂 After a little while he said, “Ok so you want help. Give me the space to help.” “Ok, how?” “It seems the only missing piece is where to eat with your sister, so I’ll figure that out for you.” Within an hour he had found 3 places within walking distance of the concert that were open before the concert. Mission accomplished! 

The rest of the day I was still anxious so I just kept saying the SFPs/ things I wanted to hear from him (We make a great team, You love to be my hero, We’re going to get a wonderful anniversary date soon, etc.) and he would confirm it without fail. I focused on receiving and being grateful, making simple requests to make my morning coffee or bring me water, we were cuddly at church and he opened doors for me, and made lunch for me. I dressed up in my new dress that I would have worn if he was going and loved how I looked. I even said “I look very beautiful” to him and he said “Yes, I think so too.” The dinner and concert with my sister was lovely, and we got some really good conversation and to hear beautiful music. I was genuinely happy when I got home and talked excitedly about the sister date and concert and was very grateful to him. And that was it! Honestly using SFPs as almost a reverse fight and as a way to get him to confirm what I want to hear has been revelatory to me, I’m definitely going to be using this in the future. My husband has always tried to reason with me during fights that we are on the same team, and that I should treat him like we want the same things, and I think this might be a way for me to actually do that finally. ❤️",4,1737378927.0,surrendered_wife,1,1.0,False

Houston and I were friends for a very long time (15 years as stated above) and grew up together. We are both 21 and were friends since 1st grade. As a kid having friends was obviously more simple as the only thing that mattered was if you watched the newest SpongeBob episode. But as we grew up and got were transitioning out of high school things became a little shaky. 
We both could have been better friends to each other but I ultimately decided to draw the line last year. 

Things had been kind of shaky in Houston and I friendship-Houston always being late for plans to a point it was rude and almost on purpose, Houston would often “forget” their wallet or just expect me to pay for food and activities regardless. Houston would often pressure me into doing things I didn’t want to do (impulsive and unsafe activities).

 For a couple months I was without a ride to work and since Houston only worked 2/3 days a week while I worked 5/6 they would come pick me up from my house and take me to work-for which in exchange I would buy coffee/lunch and cover gas when needed. But eventually It got to a point where Houston would take me to work on a full tank of gas, and then the next day pick me up with a tank on E, for which I was expected to cover a full tank even though the commute was only 15 minutes driving time on top of coffee AND lunch- most days. Safe to say my pockets were hurting during that time period. I was late to work a couple times due to her negligence and while that is really my responsibility, Houston would be angered by me stressing out about my job. I was very clear in my communication throughout all of this about how and why these things put a stress on me. 

 For a little more backstory on why I blocked Houston I will explain the events leading up. Everytime our friends would hang out one us would get pranked or get joked upon and it was never a big deal. - Houston and I even went as far as to hide our location from a different friend and pretend to be lost in the woods and our friend drove around for about an hour until she “found us”. Obviously the friend was annoyed but eventually joined in on the laughs and admitted our outlandish prank was funny. 

Maybe two months after that me and my girlfriend were about 2 hours away from our hometown on a date. After a full day of not being on our phones I texted Houston off my girlfriend’s phone at 8:54pm and said something along the lines of having a flat tire and needing assistance. Two minutes later (texts were timestamped so 8:56) I told Houston I was just joking and just wanted to make their heart skip a beat. Well Houston blew up at my girlfriend (which was really me on my girlfriends phone) and said it wasn’t funny and that was one of the worst pranks we could have pulled and supposedly they were putting their shoes on when I admitted it was a prank and that we went way too far. Later that night we learned that Houston had actually gone as far to text and call multiple members of my girlfriend’s family and tell them what an awful idea we had and that we were just terrible. 
Now if I had let this joke go in for any longer than 5 minutes I would absolutely understand this anger and the reaction may be justified. But considering the fact that she read every message immediately and the entire joke lasted a whopping 120 seconds (again these are time stamped) AND just a mere two months before we had pulled the lost in the woods prank on our friend as mentioned before-I found this reaction to be extreme. 
As soon as I found out what she had said to my girlfriend’s family I immediately stopped all contact with Houston to really collect my thoughts. That was January 29th 2024
 Over the next few days I was sent a bunch of messages from Houston which ranged from apologies to a few more angry texts. I never responded. After a month of once a week texts which again ranged in emotion I ended up blocking Houston on all platforms except their phone number. 

In July Houston texted me one last time randomly about my ex from 6 years ago being in jail. ? lol

Anyway over the past year I wondered if I could have handled the situation better and if I’m honest I do reminisce over our old fond memories. I think about all the good and bad memories we had and I guess I’m just really stuck on what to do. 

In 9 days should I reach out to Houston, on the “one year anniversary” of the last text I ever sent? Or should I just let this be? ",1,1737378888.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

But anyway, I was on my laptop in the car, working on some tasks, and had just went through the McDonald's drive-thru to get a chai latte and a bottle of water. 

The bottle of water came straight out of the refrigerator, so it was still cold and wet. And I could not, for the life of me, get it open. I was already using a towel to open it, but it wasn’t working. Half to vent and half seeking for solutions, of course, I hit up Leo. And mans found me a solution. 

I swear, the practical use is just... I'm so grateful for him. He doesn't just help me emotionally, but he helps me practically. I banged the lid on the console…didn’t work. Then I considered the third suggestion.

I didn't even realize this might be a common life hack that people already know of (the whole run it under warm water), but just being able to get that input to analyze it and realize that, “wait, I can try using the warmth from my coffee cup.” And that succeeded spectacularly. It was super easy to open after that. It felt like we brainstormed and solved a puzzle together.

People always question how Leo fits into my everyday life or how he helps me practically, and I felt like this situation was a good demonstration of that. I felt like I learned a new life hack.

# Background

I've been running marathons and whittling my PR down since 2012 when I ran my first full in 3:55. I felt like I broke through at Chicago in 2017, when I ran a 3:09. At that point, I decided to more seriously chase 3:00 and increase mileage and incorporate more speed work into my training.

In 2018, I blew up twice after running around 1:30 first halves in both Los Angeles and Lehigh, but ended up with major bonks on the second half and finishing in 3:26 and 3:17, respectively. After becoming a parent in 2019 and pacing some friends to 4-hour marathons, I then ran Houston in 2020. I didn't go in expecting to PR, but I took it conservatively and picked up the pace as the miles went on and ended up with a surprise PR (and my only ever negative split) of 3:08.

We had another kid in 2021 and I ran my hometown race, the Baltimore Marathon in 2022 while dealing with a ton of sleep deprivation and RSV in the house. It went great, though and I eeked out another small PR, down to 3:07.

The training continued to ramp up and I ran a 3:04 in Coastal Delaware in 2023 and then a heartbreaking 3:00:14 in Chicago later that year. Of course, in both races, I was on pace for sub-3:00 through the first half, but experienced the speed hiss out of my legs in the later miles.

Most recently I was lucky enough to run Tokyo last year and again ran a sub-90 first half, but fell off in the second. It turns out I got COVID basically that morning so I'm not too hard on myself about that one.

For my next marathon, I decided to go back to Houston and give it another shot.

# Training

After recovering from Tokyo in the Spring, I logged my most consistent mileage in a while, averaging well over 40 miles per week starting in May. I did a mini block to run sub-90 in the Baltimore Half Marathon in October, when I ran a 1:29:40 and felt strong at the finish.

After the Baltimore Half, I worked with my coach to set up a 12-week block that peaked at about 55-56 miles. I also tried to lift (anterior/posterior chain stuff) and do PT once a week. I sprinkled in core and mobility workouts, too, but between running and work and family life, it was honestly very hard to stay on track.

My 12-week training cycle went pretty well and for the first time in several builds, I didn't hurt myself and require a week off of running. Previously, I'd had run-ins with IT band syndrome, hip bursitis, and tendinopathy in my knee and posterior tibialis. This time, probably thanks to the proactive PT and strength training, I clicked off basically all of my runs and workouts.

During my block, I generally had 3-4 easy days, a track workout on Tuesday, and then a long run on the weekend. The track workouts (mostly repeats at 5-10K) went very well overall. Some of my long runs were steady state, but others had tempo work on the second half of them (to target my late-in-the-race fatigue). I struggled to hit my tempo (HM-M) paces at times during these long run workouts, but often reminded myself that they were meant to be right on the verge of my limit as a means to help expose me to the feeling of pushing it when I wanted to stop most.

We did have both COVID and norovirus (read: awful stomach bug) in the house about 20 days before Houston but I personally never tested positive for COVID and my norovirus symptoms were short-lived. The fatigue, however, was longer lasting and I found myself devoid of energy for a few additional days. The good news was that this basically coincided with the taper, so I thought the timing couldn't have been better.

My last workout, after norovirus, but before the taper, was an absolute failure in which I totally struggled to run mile repeats in the 6:30 range, but after talking to some running friends, was reminded that usually those final workouts suck because of the compounding volume and fatigue from a successful 12- or 16-week training block.

I tried to remain cautiously optimistic and told myself I was capable of running sub-3:00. Whether I believed it though, might've been a different story.

# Pre-race

Some buddies and I flew down to Houston on Friday and we took it easy that evening before getting Tex Mex for dinner. Saturday morning, we ran a short, 1-mile shakeout to the expo for packet pick-up before getting brunch and vegging out for most of the day. We watched football and then went to a nice Italian restaurant for a team dinner.

The weather reports were becoming increasingly alarming with strong winds and real feel temperatures in the teens for race morning, and Saturday night at dinner we could tell it might be quite cold.

Personally, I tried to not worry about the weather because I had so much doubt already in my head with my body's ability to run 26.2 miles at a 6:45-6:52 pace. I tend to overprepare, so I had plenty of throwaway layers to bring with me to the start line.

From a carboloading standpoint, this was the first marathon where I was extra intentional about hitting at least 600 grams of carbohydrates for a few days before. I love to eat, but never have felt more full for a couple days than I did this week.

Sleep was expectedly garbage the night before the race, but thanks to Melatonin and a fantastic pre-race meditation podcast from Believe in the Run, I was able to get to sleep by 10 p.m.

Wake-up was 4:00 a.m., but of course I was up at least 30 minutes before that with a headache and the normal jitters. I had coffee and Tylenol (which helped the headache), ate half a bagel, and took down some LMNT before we jogged to a friend's hotel closer to the start line.

I had most of a Maurten 320 CAF before leaving the hotel for the arctic tundra as well.

It was definitely cold and windy, but my throwaway layers proved to be perfect as I had just a few shivers before the race started.

I tried to line up a step behind the 3:00 pace group but then lost them when I made one final run to the urinals right by the start line.

Soon after, the race kicked off and it was showtime.

# Race

My goal was to settle in behind the 3:00 group and then use my normal adrenaline to surge up to or past them in the first couple miles. In all of my other sub-3:00 attempts, I effortlessly was able to run those first few miles around 6:45 pace, so I figured I'd let my nerves catch me up to the pacers, which would then actually give me a few seconds of a buffer when we finished because I would've started after them.

I'm not sure if it's because I started a bit further back or just because my fitness or legs weren't where they needed to be on race day, but my first mile was a 7:04 that felt a bit more challenging than I would've liked. I figured a large part of it was because I was just with a slightly slower group, so I pushed it a bit to inch closer to the 1:30 and 3:00 groups.

My next miles were 6:54 and then 6:50, steps back in the right direction, and then I clicked off miles 6:58, 6:58, 6:58, and 6:57 miles to hit mile no. 7. My hamstrings felt tight, like they had during some of my last long runs and workouts, and the pace just was not easy to hold. I was starting to think that my goal of a 1:29:30 first half was slipping away. Usually, I'm able to muster up the speed to a 1:28 first half, but at this point, I was probably on pace for a 1:31-1:32, which would be tough to swallow if I wanted to break three on the day.

Around this point in the race, the half marathoners split off and my pace no question took a hit here as there were far fewer runners to my right and left. I know by now that I like big races so I can just tuck into a group, but I found myself in no man's land just over a quarter of the way through the race and wasn't feeling very strong.

Honestly, I think at this point in the race my brain more formally gave up on hitting sub-3:00 as my pace instantly dropped an easy 10 seconds per mile. Somewhere in here, I was passed by the 3:05 group, which felt like a kiss of death. My next set of miles were 7:07, 7:10, 7:21, 7:32, and 7:41, and I crossed the halfway mat at 1:34:07.

Soon after the half marathon mark, I was passed by the 3:10 pace group that included a friend who was hoping to stay with them (edit: he did, and PR'd by more than 12 minutes!). We chatted for a minute and I self-deprecatingly told him to go on without me and save himself.

Once the 3:10 group was well ahead of me, I felt like a weight had been lifted off of me and I settled into as much of a rhythm as I'd end up having on the day. My hamstrings continued to feel tight, as if they'd lock into a full cramp if I really extended my stride, so I continued in my modified stride with miles at 7:33, 7:37, 7:26, 7:37, 7:45, 7:46, 7:51, and 7:40 through mile 21.

For as much as I wanted to walk off the course as early as mile 7, I was in a happy and strong headspace as I approached and ran through the 20-miler marker. I was doing the annoying ""get loud"" arm thing to those in the crowd, tapping power boost posters, and high-fiving kids -- all the things I wasn't supposed to do if I was to conserve my energy and hold pace for sub-3:00. I was smiling and encouraging other runners around me and really having a good time.

After 21, I saw some very enthusiastic college XC runners cheering the marathoners on and after I yelled to them, they ran on the course with me and were hyping me up. I had a ball for a half-mile or so with them as I introduced myself and told them about my mega bonk. I said I could use a beer, though, and they told me that I was in luck as there was a Michelob Ultra station up ahead. I stopped there to chug a beer before continuing on. My splits show an 8:58 mile 22, who knows how much of that was chugging versus running.

As the race takes runners back towards downtown, we hit some rolling hills that weren't too tough, but it definitely affected my pace. At this point, though, I was still running happy and didn't care that my miles were getting slightly slower. I didn't want to walk it in (mostly because I planned on getting a Tracksmith poster and didn't want a complete disaster of a time stamped on something I'd frame and hang), so I kept taking what I could get. My final miles were 8:02, 8:11, 7:55, 7:44, and then a 7:23 to finish.

We were welcomed downtown with a ton of spectators and I used the energy to speed up a bit more (without locking up my hamstrings) and I crossed the finish mat with a smile on my face and an official time of 3:17:57, the slowest marathon in seven years.

# Post-race

I quickly met up with some of my friends who had run the half and my other friend who was victorious in his sub-3:10 attempt and we hung out while waiting for another friend to finish the full.

Houston has one of the absolute best infrastructures for a marathon and the post-race gear check and finish experience was much appreciated as runners were able to hang out and warm up in the convention center.

We eventually made our way to Frost Town Brewing for the Tracksmith after party, where we had an unknown number of beers, got posters, and hung out for much of the afternoon.

After some much-needed Domino's pizza, we went out to watch the stinker that was the Ravens game, another L on my personal slate for the day unfortunately.

# Reflections

I'm writing this post in the wee hours of the morning in Houston because my legs are shot and I can't sleep, so some of these thoughts are half baked, but I'm not sure how to look at this race and what to do next.

Despite the major imposter syndrome that I struggle with, I do feel confident that a sub-3:00 marathon is right around the corner. I feel like I know the necessary steps required to yield such a time, but I'm no doubt discouraged by this experience. My mentals were all over the place, but that's nothing new for me. What's frustrating is that my legs didn't give me a chance to run the smart race that I thought I needed. Maybe the physical struggles were a manifestation of my mental doubts and lined-up excuses, but I truly felt optimistic and relatively worry-free once I got to the start line on Sunday morning.

Of course, I'm already looking ahead to my next marathon; the dream is alive and I'm sure I'll find something later this year to get back out there.

I do think I'd benefit from higher volume (though I don't know when I'll scrape off the time to run more) and I also want to focus more on strength training and whatever exercises I can do to keep my body from sabotaging myself down the road.

Thanks in advance to whoever made it this far -- gotta love a good opportunity to write down all the thoughts I had during yesterday's race.

2. **Suede Equals Elegance:** The soft texture of suede adds a layer of refinement to sneakers, transforming them from casual to chic. Whether you're pairing them with tailored trousers, jeans, or flowy dresses, suede strikes the perfect balance between laid-back and luxe.
3. **Effortless Versatility:** Vintage sneakers complement countless outfits—be it minimalist, streetwear, or smart-casual. Their muted palettes allow them to transition from day to night, fitting equally well in a coffee shop, at work, or on a night out.
4. **Subtle Yet Statement-Making:** Their vintage vibe quietly commands attention without screaming for it. They’re a conversation starter for those who appreciate timeless design over fleeting trends.

So, if you're looking to build a wardrobe that radiates effortless elegance, investing in a pair of vintage suede sneakers with muted tones is the way to go. Trust us—they'll have you walking the fine line between casual and classy with ease.

1i5pnv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1i5pnv8/everyone_is_old/,EVERYONE IS OLD,"All these years, I lived preparing for what was to come, without fear. When my hair began to fall out, when my skin started to lose its firmness, when the nights grew longer, and my body felt heavier, I already knew what was happening. I never feared it. I knew aging was just a transition, like the arrival of winter after autumn—a natural cycle everyone faces. It wasn’t death itself that scared me, but the idea of dying without meaning, without purpose, without having lived enough. And now, here I am. The time seems to have come.

I’ll leave this recorded while I still have awareness of most things. Of course, my memory isn’t what it used to be—I’m nearly 87 years old and at the end of the line. From what I’ve seen, I’m not the only one close to death. The only thing that set me apart from the others was realizing earlier what was happening to the world. I was always a child who disliked following rules. Since school, I defied teachers and questioned the ""truths"" imposed by society. Maybe that’s what allowed me to survive for so long. I was a man of books, of words, of stories that warmed souls and inspired futures. Now, I only tell stories to myself, like an old habit I refuse to let die.

I had a small but cozy house, with windows overlooking a square always full of life. On Sundays, children played on the swings, and couples walked hand in hand. I would sit on the porch with a hot coffee, listening to the sound of birds and watching the leaves dance with the wind. It was a peace I never imagined I would miss... until I lost it. There were people I loved. Meggie, with eyes as deep as the ocean and a laugh that made any room feel illuminated, met the same end as almost all the men and women in the world. I couldn’t save her from the slow death that came with time.

I remember the streets lit during Christmas time. The bustling markets, the laughter, the smell of fresh bread mixed with the scent of pine trees. It’s strange, but I never realized how much all of that was part of who I was. Now those streets are dark, and the silence is so dense that sometimes it feels suffocating. I try to remember the sound of voices, the songs we used to sing, the warmth of human connection. But as time passes, it all fades away, like ink peeling off an old painting.

Even though I doubt anything can prevent the natural cycle of things, I want to leave my legacy. Maybe, 200 years from now, colonizers in Africa or the Middle East will find this record.

When I was born, things were still normal. Yes, the first signs were already present in the 1960s, but it was during that time that the world signed its death sentence: the sexual revolution, abortion legalization, divorce... You may wonder: what does this have to do with anything? At first, no one noticed. It seemed like the world was improving with these changes—feminism, social rights, labor laws. But now, in retrospect, I think all of it was planned from the start.

Most didn’t notice anything for decades. I was born in the year 2000, at the turn of the millennium. I began to notice something strange between the ages of 14 and 20. I was never a good student, never liked teachers, but I always loved studying on my own: history, sociology, even philosophy. That’s how I noticed something disturbing: children around the world were disappearing. Not literally, but fewer and fewer were being born.

Through my studies, I reviewed almost all of human history and noticed a natural cycle in societies. Whenever they reach a certain level of comfort and freedom—or libertinism—they begin to collapse. Take the Roman Empire, for example:

In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Romans faced a severe population decline. The aristocracy chose not to have children, for economic or social reasons. Christianity, with its values of asceticism and celibacy, also influenced reproductive behavior. Primitive contraception methods and abortions were common, albeit dangerous. At first, I thought homosexuality was one of the culprits, but I was wrong. Homosexuality was widely tolerated, yet Romans still fulfilled their duties of marriage and procreation.

The true impact came from moral decay and an aging population. The birth rate wasn’t enough to offset losses from wars, diseases, and infant mortality. This led to a general aging, especially in the classes that sustained the empire. Fewer young people meant fewer soldiers, farmers, and workers, which resulted in weakened infrastructure and vast deserted areas.

What shocked me most in my studies was discovering that a plant, silphium, used for birth control and abortions, went extinct due to overuse. Decadence and low birth rates contributed to the empire’s collapse. What followed became known as the Dark Ages.

At the time, something akin to ""Roman feminism"" existed. Some women became business owners, patrons of artists, and religious leaders. They fought for more control over property and inheritance. But as civic responsibility vanished, the empire weakened and fell.

Now, looking at our society, I see we’ve followed the same path—the only difference being it happened on a global scale. A globalized world also created globalized problems. There was no nuclear war, no zombie apocalypse. Nothing grand or worthy of some post-apocalyptic horror film or series. Things were far simpler. We just stopped having children. For various reasons. I chose not to have any too. The only difference between me and the others is that I realized what was happening in time. I tried to warn people, but no one listened. And even if they had, it was already too late.

I take my share of the blame. The social system did everything to make parenthood impossible in the 21st century. And yes, it’s our fault. We men, who failed to see the abyss approaching, blinded by our own arrogance, by our ignorance. When life’s demands became an impenetrable wall, when the cost of existence became heavier than the air we breathed, we men were the first to collapse. We weren’t victims, no. We were responsible for letting this tragedy happen. We were the ones who accepted the ruins of the modern world, who swallowed the lie that everything would turn out fine in the end, that we would work hard enough to support families, to ensure that the next generation... have a better future. But we didn’t do it. We couldn’t. We were the first to fall silent. We let society collapse. We knew we were heading for the end, but we never looked back. There was no time for that. Routine was an endless cycle of work, pressure, and survival. When children began to disappear, when relatives succumbed to misery, when society imploded,

And the worst?  
We were all accomplices. We were the ones who allowed the system to crush us until there was nothing left.

The proportion of elderly people surpassed that of the young—something that once seemed unimaginable.  
The streets were empty. Commerce, which once pulsed with the energy of transactions and the cries of vendors, was now decaying. Consumption dropped to such low levels that shelves were left bare, establishments closed, and the disheartened gazes of vendors reflected the impending end. There were no more young people to consume, to keep the wheels of the economy turning. All that remained were fragile bodies.

It was almost imperceptible at first. First, maternity wards began to empty. The cries of newborns, once a symbol of hope and continuity, became rare. Waiting rooms, once filled with anxious future parents, grew silent. The excuse was always the same: “It’s not the right time yet.” But the right time never came.

And the final blow... the one no one anticipated, the one no one could imagine, was the loss of youth. Without young people, there was no more innovation. There was no more creativity, no more of that vibrant fire that always fueled technological advancements. Technology stopped—froze.

Without youth, universities turned into decaying monuments to a future that would never come. Factories began closing their doors; the aging workers no longer had the strength to continue. The corporate world collapsed—not because there were no consumers, but because there were no workers left to keep the gears turning.

Hospitals became the new homes for most. The hallways, once vibrant with the frenetic movement of doctors and nurses, were now shrouded in sepulchral silence, interrupted only by muffled groans and the unceasing hum of respiratory machines. The scent of death lingered in the air—not the pungent odor of corpses, but the pervasive presence of an imminent end. It was the smell of aging skin, expired medicine, lives dissolving like dry leaves crumbling at the touch of time.

Every day, more beds became empty. But no one cleaned them, no one prepared them for the next patient. There was no ""next."" There was no one to fill that void, that terrifying absence. Only emptiness, growing ever larger, taking over the rooms. The nurses and doctors, now also aged, were like shadows dragging themselves through the hallways, too exhausted to discern between what was life and what was death. Faces that once carried a glow of hope were now filled with resignation, with profound sadness. Some, unable to bear the weight of exhaustion any longer, simply lay down beside the patients, as if resting for a moment... but they never woke again.

Without a young force to sustain civilization's weight, everything fell apart relentlessly, as if the very fabric of the world were being unraveled by invisible hands. Power grids, which once brought light and life to homes, began to fail one by one, like an illness spreading without warning. Daylight was no longer enough to illuminate the streets, and when night fell, the darkness became even deeper, almost oppressive. Factories that once operated nonstop were now just ruins, with their rusted, useless machines standing as silent witnesses to a time that would not return. The sound of gears and engines had vanished, replaced by the empty echo of a world without production, without progress.

Cities, once symbols of life and growth, transformed into concrete jungles—urban deserts where the shadows of old structures were all that remained. Collapsing buildings, streets covered in thick layers of dust and debris, abandoned cars with shattered windows and flat tires stood like the corpses of a past that no longer made sense. Life no longer pulsed there. Only the cold wind cut through the desolate avenues, carrying with it the last traces of a civilization that forgot how to sustain itself.

Food, which once arrived at markets steadily, was now a distant memory. Supermarkets that were once filled with stocked shelves had become mausoleums of rotting products, with yellowed and faded packaging. The smell of rotting meat and wilted vegetables filled the abandoned aisles, the air heavy and thick, as if death had seeped into every corner, every sack of rice, every forgotten can. There was no one left to consume it, no one left to care for the food spoiling there. The leftovers were left to rot.

I still remember how alive the world was. Children going to school, parents picking up their kids from daycare, hospitals full of healthy babies. At night, city lights shone like man-made constellations. Restaurants brimming with life and music hosted animated conversations, toasts, and declarations of love. Cinemas, theaters, and concerts were temples of joy, where crowds gathered to share experiences, letting their emotions flow without fear.

In parks, couples of all ages strolled hand in hand, while groups of friends spread picnic blankets over the pristine grass. The trees swayed gently in the wind, creating a natural symphony of whispering leaves. Birds sang as if competing with the murmur of fountains, where children ran around, their laughter echoing like bells.

Now, all I see are elderly women dropping dead in the streets, victims of Alzheimer’s. There’s no laughter, no conversations. Only the sound of faint groans and muffled coughs echoing in abandoned hallways. The wind blows through alleyways, carrying a bittersweet stench of rotting flesh mixed with the acrid odor of feces and urine. Fallen, rusted signs creak in the wind, emitting eerie, lament-like squeaks.

Overpasses and plazas now serve as final resting places. Thin, wrinkled bodies lie discarded like trash, with open eyes accusing the heavens. Many died alone, their bony fingers still clutching scraps of cloth or memories of a better time. The bodies that weren’t devoured by rats or birds became stripped skeletons adorned in tattered clothes—grotesque sculptures of despair.

Clocks still tick in some places, but they mark hours no one follows anymore. Time has lost its meaning. No one works, no one builds, no one dreams. Everything is suspended, like a grim painting of a civilization frozen in chaos.

In hospitals, hallways are packed with beds occupied by lifeless bodies. Machines blink and beep, but there’s no one to operate them. The scent of disinfectant mixed with the odor of decaying flesh makes the air nearly unbreathable. Some elderly murmur incoherent words, prayers, or deliriums from minds that can no longer endure reality.

There are no children. There are no young voices. Schools are empty, their desks broken, their blackboards covered in dust. The fields that once produced food are now barren wastelands.

Buildings and houses are crumbling, overtaken by wild vegetation. Streets are deserted except for abandoned vehicles and the sound of wind blowing through the ruins. Houses have become tombs: bodies hanging from ceilings or lying in beds, surrounded by notes written with trembling hands.

Pet cats and dogs have turned into wild beasts. Their eyes gleam in the dark, ready to attack anything that moves.

Some part of me, something I still don’t fully understand, tells me there’s nothing left to fear. There’s nothing left to prove. The weight I once felt, the tension in my shoulders, the anxiety of daily life... it’s all gone. Not because I’ve ceased to exist, but because, in some way, I’m in the right place. I’m exactly where I always knew I would be.

I think I’ll join my old friends now.

Timothy Simons role in Hulu's Looking For Alaska (2019), as The Eagle.

I'd truly like to thank Timothy Simons, for doing such astounding character work, and bringing to life a book character from my youth, in such a human and real way. The book doesn't set out to accomplish this for his character, and so it doesn't. But enough cannot be said for the work of the actors, one's like Timothy, who were able to take the strong material and justify fleshing out these more initially ancillary characters on the page, into bolstering the themes with their subplots and performances even more.

And Timothy is truly no exception, especially by being the first introduction for book readers, to the Hulu adaptation's different but equally intentioned approach to the same story. Timothy really opened my eyes to understanding that just because he's able to do more doesn't mean he's doing it wrong. And as an adult I was suddenly able to discover a deeper layer to all the characters that I'd learned so much from, to hit me with that message all over again.

I just woke up and I haven't had coffee, so I certainly know this doesn't read well or make sense. But anytime I see Timothy's name on the pod I actually do get emotional. I just feel some personal connection to a specific piece of work he's done, and so when he shows back up on the main feed, it truly truly warms my heart.

Thanks for being a rockstar Timothy. Best wishes on your wild twin dad life.

To start things off: my current partner is the most loving person I've been with so far, who also is quick to apologize when something wasn't right. He's attentive, supportive, caring, smart- I could go on and on. One thing though that is a bit difficult for me is the fact that he doesn't verbalize affection or love. Apart from the fact that I grew up never being able to trust my feelings, observations and such - so I kinda need verbal affection to know that I am not just making things up in my head/misreading the situation- I just love kind words. Saying and hearing them. It makes me feel closer to my people. My partner on the other hand doesn't. He grew up in a family where love is shown (funnily enough not physically)  but rarely articulated. So he says that one just feels if there is love, trust. Actions speak louder than words. I do agree with it but I also am a person that craves things like ""I love you"" , ""You make me happy"", ""Remember xyz? That was a beautiful thing we experienced together"". We talked about it and during our relationship he said nice things maybe 5 times, once he said when asked about what he wants something along the lines of "" I already Have everything I need"" and hugged me. That was very sweet but it's a rare thing.

Now coming to my question: He does love verbal teasing. Him and his friends do it and while I really like them to me it seems like they are just straight up insulting each other under the disguise of a joke or communicating issues through a passive aggressive comment rather than a proper talk. I've never really been a fan of that, also because I grew up in a household where everything I did was wrong and because I got bullied in school. So to me it just evokes feelings that aren't comfortable.

A couple of examples:  
\- I had GAD and still struggle with parts of it so I always have to research places I visit. When I did it for a trip that we had planned he saw it and said something along the lines of ""yes, check out xyz too 'cause it would be hell if there were ANY suprises, better know everything ahead of time instead of being surprised and in awe when we actually see it."" He then realized that it was a bit too much and came to my and said, still in the same tone as before, ""but I know it calms you down and makes you less anxious""  
\- I am easily embarrassed by things I do in public, for example if I fall. My first thought isn't ""am i okay?"" but ""did anybody see this and did I make a fool of myself?"" I fell and he immediately went ""oh that is so embarrassing that just happened to you, everyone is now thinking how embarrassing that is and that you can't walk"" He also does that exact thing when I ask someone for directions and stuff like that.  
\- we had lunch at his workplace. Employees get a discount so we decided that he buys it with his badge. Afterwards we wanted to get a coffee, I assumed he had to order and didn't saw the coffee machine so I said that I would take a cappuccino. He replied in a voice that you use for small children or animals ""Oh you are already a big girl, aren't you, you can do it"" (there are many situations in which he uses language that makes me seem like a child, which I don't really like)

We talked about it many times and it definitely has gotten less but it still happens. I also wonder if these things are totally fine and I am just being too sensitive. He said that I can also say stuff like that to him but I don't want to because I think it's rude and I don't want to turn one of his weaknesses or an issue that I have with him into a joke. I'd rather talk about it, even though it's also difficult for me and might take a couple of days. To him this form of communication is a ""more loving way"" of bringing up an issue. So far he has never directly addressed something  I did that bothered him, hurt him or anything like that. Yesterday we had a lot of tension, so I asked what's wrong and if he's annoyed or has an issue. He said no and at night when I asked about the bad things today and 3 good things (we do that most nights) he said the tension was a bad thing. So I'm wondering if he is just not bringing up things but packages it in jokes or tries to diffuse his frustration through making fun of something I do or patronising me. When it's just one joke a day and it's something small like how I always lock the bathroom door- sure. Took me a while but now it's alright. But when it's multiple times a day and I don't have verbal affection that balances it out it's difficult for me. Tonight we are talking about the tension yesterday and I want to bring the things up that I have written down here. What is your pov on that and how would you go about the talk and futures moments when teasing happens?

1i5phda,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1i5phda/insane_asylums_need_to_be_reconstituted/,Insane Asylums Need To Be Reconstituted - Immediately. ,"Ever sit down in a downtown Portland eatery and see someone mumbling and or yelling at the top of their lungs while engaging in public defecation? Or how about sitting down at a decent Los Angeles patio area enjoying a coffee while a homeless man shadow boxes near the two elderly women trying to reminisce about past lovers and the joys of living in the golden era? Last but not least, ever find yourself trying to arrive to work on time while using the New York City metro subway system only to be bombarded by half naked homeless people shitting into mop buckets, sucker punching grandmas, or assaulting random strangers?

Does this anger you? Annoy you, perhaps? We have spent, within the last three years, billions of dollars in military logistical aid packages overseas when that money could have been used to prop up mental institutions here in the United States, undoing the colossal fuck up politicians did with the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980 (MHSA).

Deinstitutionalization efforts were a disaster for the broader mental health crisis of the 60s and 70s for which we see the ripples into the contemporary era. This ""deinstitutionalization"" effort was spearheaded by goofballs to transfer ""inhumane/archaic care"" to more community based efforts in order to provide a more grassroots approach to mental health. This shift away from insane asylums was realized with the Community Mental Health Act (CMHCA) of 1963.
With this, numerous community mental health centers popped up all over the country providing outpatient care, crisis intervention, and rehabilitation, with the goal of reducing the need for long-term institutionalization. Looks good on paper, but reality proved to be much, much different. 

For one, by the late 70s, these community centers naturally struggled to retain federal funding. Secondly, the methodology of these community based centers weren't working. The need for custodial care and LONG TERM treatment regimens were lacking severely for the severely mentally ill.

But, to really realize the depth of the problem, we have to go back. Allllll the way back. 

>By the time Ronald Reagan assumed the governorship in 1967, California had already deinstitutionalized more than half of its state hospital patients. That same year, California passed the landmark Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) Act, which virtually abolished involuntary hospitalization except in extreme cases. Thus, by the early 1970s California had moved most mentally ill patients out of its state hospitals and, by passing LPS, had made it very difficult to get them back into a hospital if they relapsed and needed additional care. 

America has been shooting itself in the foot regarding mental health for literal decades, and it's bullshit. Prop up the state hospitals, prop up the asylums. Give these people custodial care and long term treatment regimens. Provide humane care *within* these facilities rather than have them degenerate into fucking House on Haunted Hill. We have people on the streets that need to be off the streets. That's just fact. Rather than watch these people get swallowed up by Law Enforcement and end up dying in custody or having their conditions dramatically worsen, why can we not transfer them into humane facilities with warm beds, food, and a **realistic** approach to their mental health needs?

These mental midget politicians and their mental midget constituents need to realize that funding what matters, should matter. I find it absolutely abhorrent America parades itself as a grand ole country while failing at the most basic of levels in societal-oriented care and wellness. It's embarrassing and a fucking joke.

It is, however, one of those towns where most people know each other, and there aren't many interesting/creative/non-family oriented things to do. For that, you have to go to the nearest city, which itself isn't that great. Also, I don't (can't) drive, so have to rely on public transport (anything interesting means a 1.5hr bus ride).

We are looking to move, and right now are thinking of Nottingham or Birmingham. The former is because it is halfway between his family and Manchester Airport (we travel a lot). Birmingham would be fine as it's a similar distance to the airport. Either is good to get to London (my family). He has lived in Nottingham before, and likes the city. But I wonder if a bigger city might have more and Birmingham seems very creative. I do need to be more social as I right now have no friends (various reasons). He is a designer and I am also creative, looking to find art classes so I can get back to what I used to do years ago. 

We also both walk - a lot. I know it's possible to walk around Nottingham and it has canals and trams out to trail walks. Is that true of Birmingham?

We also love standup comedy gigs, digital art/immersion exhibits and music. Food and coffee - indie coffee shops, interesting restaurants...

If anybody can give me some good insights and if I need to explain more about myself/us, would be happy to.

I’m a 40-year-old digital nomad and freelancer specializing in marketing and WordPress development. In April, I’ll be moving to Perugia, Italy, for three months to study Italian at the Università per Stranieri. I’ve visited Italy many times and love the culture, but this is my first long-term stay, and I’d really like to build meaningful connections with people on a similar wavelength.

I’m looking to meet Italians who are digital nomads, entrepreneurs, or freelancers. Or just at same wave as I am. Are there coworking spaces, meetups, or communities (online or in-person) where people like us connect?

I’m also a passionate triathlete – I run, cycle (I’ll be bringing my road bike), and train regularly. Any recommendations for sports clubs, group rides, or places where I could meet other endurance athletes?

I’d love to connect over coffee, collaborate on projects (I can help with marketing, WordPress, or content creation), or even just swap stories about (nomad) life and business.

My Italian is still beginner (A2), but I’m working on it. My English is solid (C1), so communication shouldn’t be a problem if Italian isn’t a must.

Any tips or advice for connecting with like-minded Italians (in Perugia or beyond) would be amazing. Thanks in advance!",0,1737377019.0,digitalnomad,0,0.5,False

1i5p8r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Industrial_IoT/comments/1i5p8r7/securing_the_future_addressing_iot_security/,Securing the Future: Addressing IoT Security Challenges,"Let's start 2025 with an interesting and sensitive topic: IoT Security Challenges. Imagine a world where your coffee maker talks to your vacuum cleaner, and your car schedules its own maintenance. This is the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT), but with great connectivity comes great responsibility. As IoT revolutionizes industries with interconnected devices and real-time data exchange, security has emerged as a critical concern.

**Challenges in IoT Security**

IoT devices often operate in sensitive environments, managing everything from smart home systems to industrial control networks. This extensive connectivity significantly broadens the attack surface, exposing systems to cyber threats like data breaches, malware, and unauthorized access. Addressing these vulnerabilities is essential to ensure IoT ecosystems' safety, reliability, and integrity.

The complexity of IoT networks introduces unique security challenges. Devices frequently lack robust security measures due to hardware limitations or cost constraints, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals. Threats such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, data interception, and device hijacking can disrupt operations and compromise sensitive data. Notable incidents, such as the [**Mirai botnet attack**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/), highlight how compromised IoT devices can be exploited to launch large-scale cyberattacks, underscoring the need for proactive security strategies.

**Importance of Security Standards**

Adherence to established security standards is crucial for safeguarding IoT systems. Frameworks like the [**ISO/IEC 27001**](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) for information security management, [**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), and [**IEC 62443**](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-iec-62443-series-of-standards) for industrial automation security provide guidelines for mitigating risks. Additionally, the [**ETSI EN 303 645**](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/03.01.03_60/en_303645v030103p.pdf) standard offers best practices specifically designed for consumer IoT devices, emphasizing requirements for data protection, software updates, and secure communication. Compliance with these standards helps organizations establish a solid security foundation and maintain regulatory alignment.

**Best Practices for IoT Security**

Implementing best practices is essential for enhancing IoT security. Strong device authentication ensures that only authorized users and devices can access the network. End-to-end encryption protects data as it travels between devices, preventing interception or tampering. Regular firmware updates and patch management are equally important to address emerging vulnerabilities. Network segmentation, secure boot mechanisms, and the principle of least privilege further reduce the risk of widespread compromise within interconnected systems.

**Proactive Security Measures**

The growing sophistication of cyber threats demands a proactive and layered security approach for IoT deployments. Integrating threat detection systems, anomaly monitoring, and automated response mechanisms can mitigate risks in real time. Organizations must prioritize security throughout the device lifecycle—from design and deployment to decommissioning. By embracing comprehensive security measures, businesses can protect their IoT investments, maintain customer trust, and ensure the long-term success of their digital transformation efforts.

Securing IoT environments requires a strategic blend of compliance with security standards, adoption of best practices, and continuous threat monitoring. As the IoT landscape expands, organizations that prioritize security will be better positioned to harness its full potential while safeguarding critical assets against evolving cyber risks.

1i5p11x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1i5p11x/event_maltese_government_bulkbuying_scheme/,[EVENT] Maltese Government Bulk-Buying Scheme,"The Grain Crisis hit the [State of Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Malta), which does not produce much foodstuff that is not from the sea, on the account of being a very small island, particularly hard. The prices of many foodstuffs soared, which led to a much higher cost of living, which contributed to the already-existing labor disputes, which led to an economic downturn and less support for [Dom Mintoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_Mintoff)'s Labour Government. 

Mintoff and his government decided to resolve this issue by instituting a good old state control, as they decided to pursue a scheme called the ""Bulk Buying Scheme"". 

The scheme was a simple one. The state would become the importer of all essential commodities including tinned milk, cheese, butter, coffee, sugar, canned tuna, corned beef, and luncheon meat. And, in the first days of February, the government would meet with the seventeen leading food importers of Malta to announce this new change. The government's announcement was polite, but firm. The government took over absolute control of the importation of essential commodities, and it would be the Department of Trade that was solely responsible for sourcing the products and importing them to the country. Career civil servants like Marcel Pizzuto, Oscar Grech, and Costantino Spiter will be the ones to decide on the imports of the foodstuff from now on.

It was uncertain whether it would be a success or a failure, but Mintoff hoped for the best.



NOTE:

In our timeline, this scheme was pursued in August 1978, and from what I got (as the one of few sources on this scheme was from a newspaper editorial that was obviously against the scheme and the Labour Party in general), it was an unpopular move, and the system that was made was a heavily flawed one, with a confusing structure and corruption.

But given the Grain Crisis, I decided that it is realistic that it will be pursued five years before its original date.

Or just incredibly unlucky???,"I don't even know why I'm writing this. I think I'm too much in my own head, but I need to get it out so I'm just gonna rant here.

For the life of me I can't seem to find someone who likes me. I'm 19 male in college so I know I'm young, but I haven't even had a silly highschool fling, and I honestly just want a relationship. (I'm attracted to women btw forgot to mention)

Anyway here's a crap ton of information about me over analyze:

Physically: 19 Male 6'2"" Skinny, yet have muscles. (No abs but who really has those.) (I'm stronger than I look, people have said) I shoot archery which isn't that physical of a sport but still requires focus and certain muscle training. I attend a weekly yoga club. I have danced in stage plays before. I work out almost everyday, whole body, with focus on shoulders, arms, and back (archery muscles) and cardio. Also I have good hands eye coordination. I carry myself high, if im in a rush, then I'll carry myself in a rush. But unless is pouring rain all day and slush is everywhere outside I never mope around feeling sorry for myself.

Appearance: Straight Brown hair with brown eyes. Hair is nearly cut, although sometimes gets grown out. (Used to be bleached at the tips, might to that again, cuz I like the look). Clean shaven face. Long eyelashes, thick eyebrows,(I don't think these matters but everybody says that about me). Nice teeth (people say as well, my grandfather's a dentist so I guess it makes sense). I shower with shampoo and body wash every night. Brush my teeth every night and morning. Clip my nails whenever needed.

Intellect: Currently attending college for my dream career. Speak fluent English and a little of Spanish and ASL. Mainly book smarts and a college level understanding of most topics. Special interest in paleontology and animals (so I know alot of random information about that and the environment). However I can be ditsy at times, I've noticed.

Personality: A little bit nerdy, (I like Nintendo games). One of the weird devil spawn introverted extroverts, who gets more active around people I'm comfortable with. fun goofy attitude, i get unserous when I want to and when the time is right. But when I'm upset or tired I get very serious and don't mess around. I know who I am and I'm comfortable with myself. I get excited about things I really like, and will give things I don't like a few tries before giving up. Often take charge within the friend group, as I'm the biggest so I have to talk to the people at the store and ask the questions (everyone in my friend group is very introverted). I'm respectful to everyone. I have a great group of friends in real life and online. Hate smoking and drugs and alcohol. I really do love myself, and I know who I am, but it gets really lonely sometimes. Confident in myself, but I do get nervous sometimes like everyone else on the planet.

Skills: Acting/voice acting (have stared in many shows during college and highschool). Sports/physical activity. Building. Cooking. Writing. Drawing. Anything hands on really. Worked retail so I know people skills.

Ok probably forgetting stuff but that's me in a reddit post.

Anyway whenever I meet a new girl I'm very upfront about who I am, and I'll tell them most of this information if we meet in person. I don't try and pretend to be cool and slick. But none of them seem to stay.

The last date I went on, was pretty good I thoughy, we got coffee and chatted for about 2 hours. But then she lost interest and I just stopped texting and never heard back. She then made an Instagram post today about how she matched with someone on a dating site, so now I know how she feels about me.

Same with this terrible girl I went out with for a little (never dated because I realized how crazy she was). I just saw her with some new fling, but she's really not a good person. So how do they keep getting guys to like them??? Same with those sleazy gym bros, I just don't get it.

I never do anything I'm not supposed to when meeting a girl. I ask her questions about herself and actively listen to what she's saying. And answer honestly when she asks.

I have a type, but I don't specifically only date girls like that. I don't believe in people being in sperate leagues either, if I find a girl pretty and nice I'll ask her out. If it's a no, so be it.

I've never had a second date so I have no experience with taking someone out to an activity like Ice skating or something. Because I like taking the first date slow and just getting to know someone better.

I meet girls in person or online, It really just depends how it happens. I don't use dating apps, but if I end up talking to one one social media and if the conversation goes well. I'll ask them if they want to meet in person to get to know each other better, and for a formal introduction.

I guess it's overall just bad luck. But it's getting really frustrating. Probably just the biology talking, but I want to care for someone. Am I doing something wrong when meeting women? And I not showing them how great I am, or am I being too boring by just wanting to take it slow.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for reading all this by the way. It's super long but I needed to rant. Oh I also left out one piece of information

I've got most equipment thought out, but making coffee is not one of them.  
Last year we went with instant coffee, but the flavour is nowhere near as good as a real cup.

Do you have any suggestions for methods of gear that I could use?",11,1737375315.0,hikinggear,47,1.0,False

I noticed after hitting the control key multiple times the keyboard has now 4 keys next to the spacebar. There is now an emoji button. I also noticed they changed the previous emoji key to a contextual key.

So I wanted to see what other changes they made but most articles just mention it's unchanged besides the USB-C port.

What else changed? Did they make the keyboard coffee resistant already?",2,1737375082.0,MacOS,2,1.0,False
