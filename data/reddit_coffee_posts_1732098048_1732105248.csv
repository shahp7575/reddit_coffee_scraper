1gvo6iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovementday/comments/1gvo6iz/you_can_control_your_emotions/,You can control your emotions!!,"I Often Laugh when people say ""I have anger issues, i can't control it"", I get triggered easily and blah blah...

Ok let me tell you a example

Imagine your childhood days, While mom having a heated argument with you suddenly a phone rings, she answers it but with calmness, not showing any anger signs and once the call is ended, She will again start arguing.

Just think about it..... Are our mom are superhumans who can control emotions??

Ok let me tell you another example

A waitress accidentally slipped a coffee over your shirt, What will be your reaction immediately, (For most of them). You will start yelling, you are start worrying and make angry gestures to her.. But what if i told you had a second option to response.  You can attended that issue calmly right, because anyways she will give you a compensation or take your shirt to laundery. But you choose angry option. And the reason might shock you,

By the goal of shouting, you wanted to make the waiter submit to you and listen to what you have to say, as means to do that you fabricated the emotion of anger.

  
Just think about it....

  
In your every anger instances, you had a goal/wants to get angry... 

And this is such a big topic and i am still in learning phase and also appreciate if somebody explains this in detail below.

Ok For now I want you to realize that., You often get angry not because of you can't control it, It's because you wanted to get angry. Emotions are not controlling you, You are the one who controlling the emotions.",1,1732105160.0,selfimprovementday,0,0.99,False

It has a small coffee area and me and my mum were sitting there. All the kids were coming back in from their lunch. It was terrifying honestly. It reminded me of myself being back in high school in the 2010s. I felt particularly sorry for the ones that were coming back on their own, trying to maintain a low profile so they don’t become a target. Sometimes I feel nostalgia for high school, but the “lord of the flies” atmosphere is something I forget. What’s it like being in high school nowadays?

1gvo5g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gvo5g0/aita_cutting_off_my_alcoholic_dad/,AITA - Cutting off my alcoholic Dad,"This is a really hard post to write but I really want to hear an outsiders perspective. I am open minded to criticism and I will try to acknowledge if any of my behaviours are wrong or bad. 

For context, my Dad is mid 60s. He had a very important career most of his adult life which required him to work away from home a lot. My Mum was the main parent so to speak. She did so much for our family as well as having a career of her own. She always made sure the house clean and we had good dinners etc. My Dad didn’t contribute as much, because of his job and to an extent I believe because of traditional outlooks on men and women in the home. I’m not saying I agree with that but it’s that way it was in our house. My Mum was superwomen and waited on my Dad. He did work very hard though and was the main breadwinner. 

Sadly my Mum passed away suddenly a few years ago. This was a horrific time for my family, we did not expect it and the grief afterwards was horrible. Still to this day we’re all feeling the effects of her passing so quick. My Dad especially, they were soulmates and she was the one who kept his life in order I think. He went from having my Mum run his day to day life to having to organise a lot of things for himself that he normally never did. 

He then retired and got back into the swing of things, he joined a club and made friends and tries to keep busy with that. 

However my Dad became an alcoholic, he had always liked a drink but my Mum kept it in check. Once she passed he started drinking most days. It was really hard to deal with, I was working full time and had my own home and marriage and was constantly worried and having to check on him. It started to affect my work as I would have to leave mid shift to check on him. 

I approached him about his drinking and he promised he would get it under control. I tried to bring up support groups or counselling but he shut me down. I really didn’t know what to do. He was a grown adult, I couldn’t force him to get help. 

In the past year my Dad has continued to show signs of alcoholism. I even caught him drink driving and again had to have a word with him. But I was basically just shut down and told not to worry. I have cried to him, begged him to stop and get help but he never does. 

I’ve noticed also that if I don’t reach out, txt, call or arrange a coffee or a walk together. He will not contact me, I can go weeks without him contacting me. It’s always got to be on my part. This really upsets me because I feel like he doesn’t make the effort and really care. I have brought this up twice in the past few years but he just says he’ll do better then never does.

He is always out with club friends and always posts about them on social media. But will never contact me. Again I have to always be the first to initate contact. 

 Sometimes I’ll send him a message or phone and he won’t respond or answer. And when I bring it up he just says he forgot. But he’ll continue to post on social media with his friends. It really gets me down. 

I sent him over my wedding video last week and I got no response. I was so happy for him to finally see it and he just ignored my message. Two days later he posted with friends on social media about an event they went to. 

My Dad has money and has helped me out in the past if I’m stuck, I never ask however and I’m always very grateful for any help. But I don’t care about the money, I just want my Dad. I sometimes feel like if lost two parents. He’s not came over to my house in about a year. Even though I live 15 minutes away. 

I would love nothing more than my Dad just to phone and check or pop over or even ask when I’m free for a coffee. I would love that so much, just to know he actually wants to hang out with me. 

He’s still drinking, I do know and I don’t know what to do about it. I don’t want to enable it  but I’m stuck.

Also and this is a bit of a weird situation. He told me he had cancer and quite a serious cancer of which there is a very low recovery rate. He then went silent and gave me no information about treatment or anything. I got nothing. About 6 months later he said he was in recovery. A lot of family are a bit skeptical, it just doesn’t make sense. His appearance hasn’t even changed, there’s no obvious symptoms and it was quite a brutal cancer he said he had. I’m so confused. Part of me thinks it was an alcoholic drink thing he said looking for sympathy.

He has a pattern of wanting attention ever since my Mum died. He’s constantly talking about himself and doesn’t care for others stories. It’s always about him, he likes the attention. And I don’t know if that is a result of my Mum passing. He craves it and it’s really sad to watch sometimes. 

He’s also went super right wing and has been openly racist and sexist in public. When I call him out he calls me woke even though I wouldn’t say I’m far left, more central. I just don’t like public display of anything hateful. It’s really embarrassing especially when he’s drinking. He once made a comment in a restaurant about there being too many Asians, I was mortified. I called him out and he tried to belittle me and call me sensitive. 

He also made a speech at my wedding where he made female driver jokes about me, even though I asked him not too. This really upset me, it’s the one thing I asked him not to do

I said to my husband I don’t know whether to cut of contact. It’s been nearly a week and I haven’t heard from him. He stays so close as well. I don’t know whether to start distancing myself or again try to bring up how his behaviour affects me. But usually it falls on deaf ears. 

Am I being too sensitive? I don’t what to do!

1gvo4ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gvo4ie/help_me_get_a_good_setup_machine_grinder_2000/,Help me get a good setup (machine + grinder) [2000€],"Hey guys, I'll try to stick as much as I can to the posting guidelines for buying advice.

A little bit of context here. I'm a coffee enthusiat for about 7 years already. I really enjoy it. Back then I had a pod machine which I was happy about. It was not until my sister discovered me good coffee places (trusted roasters who made quality coffee) when I realized what I was having was crapy coffee. I then moved to a Superautomatica, basically because limitations on budget and space. It was the correct step for me since I could have freshly ground coffee direct to the cup. I was very happy about it. Now, I cannot tell you how I hate this machine. It delivers ""good"" coffee (in comparison to what I had before), but I am always waiting for the opportunity to get to a good coffee place and drink a good coffee. Now I am in the situation where I have a bigger budget and no (big) limitations on space, so I want to get myself a good setup under 2000€ (machine + grinder, other equipment not included). I would like to have a choice of different machines to see if I can leverage some Black Friday disccounts. Of course if the total price is less than 2000€, better, but that is the top budget limit. So here are the details and some questions at the end:

* **Location**: Spain (Europe)
* **Preferred drink types**: Espressos and Lattes basically
* **Drink frequency**: 3-4 espressos per day and 3-4 lattes per week
* **Space**: No limitations (for a machine and a grinder on the price range)
* **Experience level**: I want to upgrade from a beginner (noob) setup
* **Manual or electric**: Electric

**Coffee machine**

For the coffee machine I thought about one with the following capabilites: dual boiler, PID (better to control both boilers temperature, if not only the group head), preinfusion (mechanic or electronic), 58mm portafilter for better compatibility

About the group head, I'm a bit lost. As far as I know (and maybe I am wrong), E61 group head has the habiliy to create a mechanical preinfusion. To be honest, I don't feel attracted aestetically about those heads, but if that means I will get better coffe than with other group heads, I'm open to it. That menas, I would rather prefer another group head, visually speaking.

With these requirements I arrived to the conclusion to have the **Rancilio Silvia Pro X** (I know, I know: the tray). For me that's a beautiful machine and it has all the requirements I would like to have. I also had a look at the other machines [listed here](https://espressoaf.com/recommendations/midrange-machines.html). Any advice would be welcome.

**Grinder**

For the grinder I am a bit lost. As I am having mostly espressos I would like to have a grinder capable of grind fine enough for espresso, and having the ability to fine adjust these settings (probably a stepless grinder?). Also, I think the best approach would be to have a single dose grinder with the minumun retention possible. I don't like the idea of having a doser (via a timer?) on the grinder, as this could vary depending on other environment variables to get the right amount of coffee weight (correct me if I am wrong). Of course I could have one with doser and use for single dose. For the abitilty to eject what it could have been stuck in the grinder, I don't really like bellows (as per some reviews, I feel those are messy when extracting the last bits of coffee). What about flat vs conincal burrs? I don't have a clear idea of what would be best for my use case. And what are the implications about the size of those? And do I have to look for any burr size that in case I would like to change the discs in the future?

With this in mind I thought about the **Niche Zero** (I don't know what is the difference -in outcome- with the Niche Duo) (sincerely, I don't like it aestetically, but I don't mind having it if it does a good job) and the **Timemore 064s**. I think these are both suitable for espresso preparation, right? I also thought about the **Fellow Ode** or **Fellow Opus**, but I am not sure if any these are good for espresso, I don't want to spend less but having to regret in the future. Again, any advice or guidance would be welcome.

Thank you for reading it and having the time to help me!",1,1732104967.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I've been thinking a lot about credit card debt lately, especially after seeing so many friends struggle with it. It's crazy how easy it is to fall into this trap, and I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences on this topic.

Let's be real - credit card debt is like quicksand. Once you're in it, getting out can feel impossible. I've watched people close to me sink deeper and deeper, and it's made me realize how important it is to understand why this happens in the first place.

From what I've seen, there are several main reasons people end up in credit card debt:

1. Emergency Expenses
Life loves to throw curveballs. Medical bills, car repairs, or sudden job loss can force people to rely on credit cards when they don't have savings. I learned this the hard way when my car broke down last year.

2. Lifestyle Creep
This is a sneaky one. As our income grows, we often start spending more without really thinking about it. That daily $5 coffee and those random Amazon purchases add up fast.

3. Lack of Financial Education
Schools don't teach us about money management, and many of us learn about finance through trial and error. I've been studying personal finance for years now, and I'm still learning new things every day.

Here's what I've found helpful in avoiding credit card debt:

- Track Every Dollar
I use a simple spreadsheet to monitor my spending. It's not fancy, but it works. Knowing where your money goes is half the battle.

- The Emergency Fund Rule
Having 3-6 months of expenses saved up has saved me from many potential credit card disasters. Start small - even $500 can help.

- The 24-Hour Rule
When I want to buy something non-essential, I wait 24 hours. It's amazing how many ""must-have"" items I forget about after a day.

- Treating Credit Cards Like Debit Cards
I only spend what I already have in my bank account. This mindset shift was game-changing for me.

If you're interested in learning more about personal finance, avoiding debt, and building wealth, I've been sharing detailed insights and strategies in my newsletter at https://orangementor.com. I cover everything from basic money management to advanced investing strategies and entrepreneurship tips.

Remember, the goal isn't to never use credit cards - they can be great tools when used responsibly. The key is understanding how to use them without letting them use you.

What's your experience with credit cards? Have you found any strategies that work particularly well for avoiding debt? Let's discuss in the comments!

P.S. The most important thing I've learned is that financial freedom isn't about making more money - it's about making smarter decisions with the money you have.",1,1732104733.0,RichRoadmap,0,1.0,False

It was essentially an anti-Trump expression of outrage, scorn, and skepticism.   He made his point, then Mika told him to shut up.

Greg was and is incredibly sweet, kindhearted, thoughtful and genuinely a very loving partner. He rarely acts in a manner that is outrageous and we’ve only had one big fight and it was during a trip to Florence, last year (we were 2.5 years in at this point). 

For context, when Greg and I met, I was going through an extremely challenging time and he was there for me. I would be lying if I didn’t say his stability and willingness to be there for me didn’t make me clutch for him at the time. I’ve also always supported him, and still do support him, I egg him on to chase his goals, cook him amazing meals and will uber to him across town to take care of him when he’s sick. 

But lately, and when I mean lately, I mean since the first year of our relationship there have been ups and downs - where I find myself lusting after more masculine men. I’ve tried to stop it and I’ve never acted upon it, and our sex has dried up because well, I’m not into him in that way anymore. Further, he eats terribly (despite my pleas for him to change his diet, and even cook healthy, delicious cuisine - I was formerly a trained cook) and doesn’t work out and has let himself go. 

More lately, he seems to have noticed I guess that I’ve stayed healthy and fit, and I guess notices the attention I receive, usually from fitter and extremely attractive men. He makes comments that I don’t think are malicious but are to me a reaction to that issue and I guess insecurity he feels. 

In 2021, after a long lockdown and DV incident I had with my dad, I asked for some space and wanted to end things to work on my mental health and I guess have some breathing space. He didn’t take it well at all, threatened to kill himself if he couldn’t be with me, and didn’t respect my wish of no contact for a week or two. He then begged me to meet him for a coffee and he had a list of things he could do to resolve our issues - covered in his tears. I know that man is still in there, and I do love him, but I also feel like a part of me is maybe missing out on something. 

During that fortnight where I broke up with him, I connected with a man who took me out for a drink, and the chemistry was there and I honestly had fun I didn’t have in years. I guess I miss that feeling of being alive - but I know it’s fleeting and circumstantial, and I want a life partner that doesn’t want to dim my shine, or see me as only a vessel for sex. 

I’ve tried to talk to him about all this stuff and I have tried to keep the faith that things would turn around. But he says one thing and then another occurs and I guess I’m feeling unfulfilled physically and he is too because I’m not giving it to him anymore. I don’t know if it’s possible to work through it, or let it go. 

I love him deeply, and don’t want to hurt him. But I’m not getting any younger and I want the best for the both of us. What are your thoughts? ",1,1732104503.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

A security camera observes the interactions, and a small table partitions the hallway into two halves that lead to separate entrances.

The General sits at a chessboard quietly, sipping a cup of coffee. Off to his side is the standard greeting table with coffees, pastries, cream and sugar. A small sign reads ""help yourself"".

From one end, a hissing door opens followed by the steam of an alternative atmosphere. An alien in an exosuit enters. He is impressively tall and his mouth a combination of fangs and tentacles. His legs are built like a grasshoppers, his upperbody like that of a spider. The ground shakes slightly as he walks, and his smaller manipulators hold a technological interface, glowing green in his hands.

The alien walks until he arrives at the table. ""What is this?""

""A place to talk. Have a seat.""

The alien, confused at the obviously impossible request, given his body construction, ignores the invitation.

The alien begins, speaking through a universal translator ""We have come to discuss-""

He stops as the captain sips his coffee, listening attentively.

The alien stops. ""What is that?""

The General, confused, looks at his cup. ""A drink.""

The alien scans the cup and seems to smirk. ""Your nutrient paste is inferior.""

""Its just coffee."" The general replies, raising his eyebrow. ""It's quite good. We brought some if you'd like to partake.""

""Coffee? Is that what you call your intake?""

""Its a liquid derived from some bean on our planet. I'm not really sure. Its not all we eat.""

The alien seems to grapple with the concept for a moment. ""You have alternate nutrient intakes?""

The General smiles. ""We have many.""

The alien walks over to the table curiously. ""Why are there so many variations? Do they supply alternative vitamins or minerals?""

""Coffee? Beats me. But most of don't like waking up without at least a cup of it. It doesn't really have much nutritional value.""

""Why would you consume this then?""

""Tastes good. Wakes you up.""

""Wakes you up?""

""It's caffeinated.""

The alien pauses. ""I do not recognize this term.""

""It's a stimulant. A drug.""

The alien blinks, typing something on the pad. ""Your species requires medicine to survive? This is a great weakness.""

The General laughs. ""Not to survive. We like it. Some of us just drink it to... ease our temperament. Lots of people say they get grumpy without it.""

""Ease your... It is a mood stabilizer? And its a stimulant?Are all humans angry when they wake from hibernation?""

""More often than not."" The General laughs. ""It suppresses feelings of exhaustion. Gets us excited and ready for the day. We usually put sugar and cream into it... I'm sorry, can we get down to business now?""

""What is sugar?""

""Uh... I guess in your terms, its a concentrated energy source. Glucose. Our cells, especially the brain, uses an impressive amount of it.""

""I see...""

""Are you ready?""

""Of course."" The alien replies and comes back to the table. Before it can say anything else of import, it looks back at the coffee table. ""At the conclusion of our negotiations, I would like to bring a sample back to our scientists. Along with this... 'sugar'.""

""Whatever floats your boat, skippy."" The General shrugs. ""Take the whole cart if you like.""

The talks resume. Later on that day, the aliens complete their analysis of coffee, and after sending several more concerned questions about the substance, their mothership breaks atmosphere and vanishes.

It's been six months.

Some context:
About 10 months ago, I was going through a really difficult time emotionally (and still am to some extent). At the time, I was living with a friend for around two years.

Our living arrangement was this: my grandma owns the property, but I was responsible for all the bills, including rent. My friend paid rent to me, and I would pass it on to my grandma. The issue was that he would constantly pay me late—sometimes weeks after I asked—leaving me to front most of the bills.

As time went on, things got worse. He started treating our shared lounge as his own, often closing the door and leaving it messy with clothes, food crumbs, and other things. When my emotions were already running high, I hit a breaking point.

I begged my grandma to evict him, but instead, she let him move into her portion of the house (it’s subdivided), leaving me to still manage all the bills. I got so frustrated that I ended up blocking him.

For the next 10 months, even though he moved into a different part of the house, we were still in close proximity. This made it really hard to talk to other friends in our shared friend group. One of my closest friends subtly took his side, eventually cutting off communication with me. That hurt a lot, so I blocked him too.

Unfortunately, this friend played a central role in organizing events and maintaining group dynamics. After I stopped talking to him, I felt like I was excluded from the group. Many of my friends moved to another Discord server and stopped inviting me to meetups. I was left feeling isolated, with no casual way to stay in touch.

Now, another friend from the same group has reached out and invited me for coffee. Part of me wants to go because he’s been supportive in the past, even messaging me to say he’s there for me. That gives me some hope. But at the same time, he’s stayed in touch with the friends who hurt me, continued to participate in group activities, and never invited me. That stings.

I’m anxious about this meetup. I don’t want to be pulled back into contact with the people who made me feel used and undervalued. At the same time, I want to move on emotionally and build relationships with people who genuinely care about me.

One of my partners, m37, let's refer to him as L, and I have a romantic and sexual semi-long distance relationship. We se each other a few times a month for a couple a days, talk on the phone several times a week and text everyday.

L is also poly, and when we met he was involved with a woman, f42, let's call her K, that I have met a few times through friends and a shared hobby.

In the beginning of mine and L's relationship she started showing some concerning behavior, seen from a poly perspective. Jealousy, possessiveness, weaponized victimhood, emotional manipulation and just plain creating drama.
She do have borderline, so I am aware that a lot of it, is probably part of her mental illness. But for me, that doesn't make it any less problematic.

Anyway. This of course exploded in a huge scene at a big scale event with a lot of shared friends was present. Luckily not that many noticed. But some did and K even tried to drag another one of my partners into the fight.
L, who has ptsd was so triggered by the force of her reaction, that it sent him in a full ptsd spiral.
I myself was shocked and quite frankly traumatized.

Well. That happened, we tried to talk it over the three of us. Me, L and K. I couldn't handle her manipulative ways and actually initiated a breakup between me and L. L continued to try and reason with K for a few days, but initially he broke it off with her. L and I talked things through. I said that I would never allow myself to be part of anything like that again. L said he had realized how toxic his and K's relationship had been, and he could never live with something like that again.

So we were on the same page. Or so I thought.
Skip like 5-6 month ahead. 
I new that L had continued to have contact with K. mainly because he was a bonus father to her two teenage twin daughters. I was ok-ish with that. He showed some healthy boundary setting and we had lengthy talks where he assured me that there would never be a scenario where he could imagine getting back together with K. And he opened up about some of the toxicity and emotional abuse that had been in there relationship.

K's mental health takes a turn for the worse, L sets boundaries and refuse to be her safetynet. She gets some quality help and is presumably getting better, even better that she had been in years.

Here comes the Aita part.
L has now confessed that seeing K being back to the person he first met, has sparked some positive emotions in him. He is unaware what they specifically is, but he might want to explore them. Maybe ask K out for coffee, possibly start dating her again.

I said flat out, That naturally he should do whatever would make him happy, but if it had anything to do with K, he would have to do it without me in his life.

I am aware that I don't actually know if she has changed, I only has L statement. And I know she has masterfully manipulated him before.
I'm aware that my own radical polyamory beliefs dictates that I, aswell as my partners are free to love and persue anyone and anything that brings them joy.

So am I the asshole for breaking up with L, as to not get hurt and not making him choose between me or K.?",1,1732103985.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

Fags with money are so fucking gay.”  I just gave him a head turn, laughed, and went in. 

While checking out, I overhear the discussion at the register next to me where the customer doesn’t have enough money. I look up, it’s just a coffee, so I’m about to say I’ll cover it. Buuuuut who is it? My friend from outside. We make eye contact while I’m checking out, and I said “hmm.. normally I would’ve offered to pay for that, but this fucking fag just doesn’t want to share with you.”   I smiled, and walked away. 

Outside, he asks me what I do for a living that I can afford that car. My answer? “I sell teslas to people with money.” Then, pretty flamboyantly said “tootaloo” and walked  away.

Some funny facts. I was on my way to volunteer teach group therapy to abused women, addicts, and those struggling with gay feelings. I just bought my Tesla, used.

The cup was a bit hallow to say the least. I got the floral notes and notes of lime but it was a bit tame in general and tasted similar to how my grinder tasted when it wasn’t aligned meaning hallow, watery and lacking a certain fullness. 

This had me think: I’m I really making better coffee at home? Because if I would have made this cup I would have corrected it after. Perhaps check the alignment or ratio, pouring technique or grind size.

Even though I was a bit disappointment with this cup it certainly made me think that I have evolved a lot as a home brewer and perhaps to the point where I can relay on my senses on what is good and what isn’t.

This is my first job out of collage, and I'm about five months in. two months ago a new guy started and I trained him. His slack profile picture is a family easter photo in front of a church building. so I knew he was probs LDS but didn't say anything

in his third week I walked into him telling our team that he was mormon, (the usual speech about not drinking coffee). I am a pretty open person and had already told them I had grown up that way before he came (but breezed pass the trauma, as you do). My co-works mentioned this, and I didn't want it to be some dirty secret so I was honest with him. 

He then told me he was the second counselor, and mostly took this job because the stake prez had asked him to move to help out a ward in need of leadership. so...mormon mormon then. I told him privately I would not bring up anything to him or co-workers that was awkward, and asked that he be respectful as well, he agreed and seemed chill. 

At first it was fine, he did use mormon lingo around me, but it was mostly jokes about funeral potatoes. then, after conference weekend it got a little worse. Our job is managing blue collar workers, so it's mostly walking around and talking to be people. I got the vibe that he was following me (it's huge building and doesn't make sense for leaders to be near each other). he invited me to church with his family, and I said thanks but no thanks. he was chill about it, but the next day he asked again. Every day, near the start of our shift, he will get me alone and ask me to church. He's started getting pushy about why I left, offering me rides to get my address, asking personal questions. I usually laugh, deflect, and run away.

  
I am less tenured in the industry than him, but I am in charge of our team. He will refuse to do tasks I assign him in public slack channels, and once DMed me a long rant about how it was inappropriate to ask that he take care of something when I was tied up with something else. I am all about team work, and make it known that if I am able I'll help out a coworker I will, but he often asks me (both in public chats and DMS) to do busy work for him that is honestly bellow both of our pay grades, and a lot of the time, he's not doing anything that would stop him from doing it himself. He does not do this to my co-workers, and they have pointed out unprompted that he talks down to me, and treats me like I'm less mature than the rest of the team. 

  
I am the youngest on the team (by a lot) and it is my first job, but I'm also really good at it and he speaks to me like he's \*my\* priesthood leader, it's honestly really triggering. Is this something I can bring up to our boss? HR? I don't know if I could/want to explain why he would have this power dynamic with me. help?",5,1732101911.0,exmormon,4,1.0,False

1gvn9dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gvn9dp/financial_infidelity_again/,Financial infidelity AGAIN ,"TL;DR,  My partner M32 and I F34 are high school sweethearts (14 years together in December). Question clarification- Will I be making the biggest mistake of my life if I choose to leave him? 


We met first time when I was 20 and where friends for 6 months before we started to date. I went to international high school and had already studied abroad a few years, lived separately from my parents and dated several guys even had a one year relationship before meeting my partner. We come from two different continents and met in my home country. Both from middle class backgrounds. 

Due to many different reasons (childhood sexual trauma among them the other being that my father is diagnosed with borderline disorder) had a really rough time in my teenage years and applying to international Highschool was my way of ""getting out early"". 

When I met my partner I felt immediate connection and attraction. I tried to keep my hands away during 6 months as I didn't want to rush into any relationship. When we finally went on a date.. followed by years of great relationship with mutual trust. By then we start university and my brother checked my mailbox while we visited my partners family in America. And there was a bill on 1500 USD. This was at a time when I was saving everything I could and tried to keep expenses low as possible as we lived on loans. He had bought a vinyl player, vinyls and things and had a gigantic student loan just growing. My mother helped talking sense into him and he payed it off borrowing my money. I got the money back. It was not a learning experience. 

5 years later I discovered he had credit card bills at 22 000 USD. This was at a time when I was taking SSRI and seeing a therapist every week to talk about my childhood trauma. I was a mess. He promised to pay bills off that year and I supported him emotionally asking how he was doing and checking in on him for a full year until boom.. he dropped his secret card stash (those he promised to cut when we together cut his cards a year earlier). He promised to take therapy or I would leave him. We created some distance between us as he moved abroad to work earning more money and paying off the credit card loans. 

He managed to pay those off and we started to become closer again. Trust grew and we did a lot better. I felt like we could connect and talk about anything. I was completely open to him and expected the same in return. Every month we sat down and looked at our monthly expenses (we still owned the apartment together) and we shared food costs when together. I would visit a month here and there working remote. Our savings grew on my account and on his it was supposed to be around 10 000 usd in savings in addition to what he contributed to our common savings at my account. So every time we payed the bills I was expressing how proud I was that he had changed as he said he did. I also thought I looked happier. We connected better. 

Every time he lay out for groceries I asked in low voice are you sure you can take it on your card? Or should I? You don't take from the savings account right? And he said no I got it under control. Meanwhile he said he no longer needed therapy sessions. It was fine he had control. 

Until this last weekend. He is supposed to move home Dec 1 and I asked him to transfer the money to our common savings account. We have talked about it monthly and he and I have checked best way tax wise to do it. While having conversations at our common apartment I noticed he shifted from belly breath to chest breathing and he completely shifted position in the chair looking uncomfortable. So I asked what had happened and he said it's mostly gone due to tv tax etc. I was baffled and contacted my therapist. He said I should ask to see the account. The morning after he showed an empty account. 

Meaning he repeatedly lied to me at the end of every month the last 1,5 years and every time I talked to him in grocery stores (100 times over 1,5 years?) as well never asked for help or corrected me when I talked to him about how he was doing mentally and financially. 

Luckily he has not been able to take loans in our home country due to the address change. The credit card he had was prepaid only which makes me think that's why he took from the savings account. Anytime he wanted to do some sport or enjoy something he took out cash. Meanwhile I have not spent money like that at myself. He used up our yearly common budget to go and see his family in Canada. 

I had therapy for codependency and I'm not. I am very interested in psychology and I know he is not a narcissist. Yes some tendencies but the guy loves children, animals and anything cute. Cries when he watches titanic. He has many good sides and is a caring person who usually wakes me up with a coffee and a kiss last 14 years together. 

We will meet with therapist tomorrow together. I feel like I'm questioning everything between us and I'm not sure I can ever feel safe in the relationship. Let's say I guard his salary on my account and see the accounts grow with time. There is nothing stopping him from taking out loans in his own name in secret. He comes from a family where his father has no issues taking a loan to buy and expensive car while his mother barely can afford new sneakers. Lots of the money seams to have gone to his own pleasure and his own convenience. The money was intended to be used as down payment for our next house. ",3,1732101712.0,relationships,8,1.0,False

We’re designing a multifunctional bed for small apartments and people who move frequently and would really appreciate your feedback. Traditional beds take up too much space and can be a hassle to assemble, so we’re rethinking the concept.

Here’s what we’ve come up with:

1️⃣ Modular Storage Boxes

* Built-in storage at the bottom of the bed.
* These boxes can be easily slid out and double (or even triple) as:
   * Storage compartments,
   * Small coffee tables,
   * Maybe even extra seating when needed.

**2️⃣** Transforming Side Panel

* One side of the bed opens upward to give you quick access to extra storage space.
* The side panel itself transforms into multiple uses:
   * Fully-open: It becomes a bench for seating, great for guests.
   * Half-open: It works as a bedside table for drinks, books, or other essentials.

3️⃣ The bed is made up of modular blocks, so it’s quick and hassle-free to set up or take apart—perfect for people who move often.

* These blocks aren’t just for the bed! You can repurpose them into other furniture, like:
   * A table
   * Chairs
   * A room divider
* This way, your furniture adapts as your needs or living space change.

What Do You Think?

* Would you use these features?
* Which matters more: ease of assembly or the extra functions?
* What’s missing that would make this bed perfect for your needs?

We believe limited space shouldn’t limit comfort. Your feedback will help us create a smarter, more adaptable bed. Thanks for sharing your thoughts! 🙌",0,1732101582.0,minimalism,0,0.5,False

1gvn7g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/salvageunion/s/r8sUh3FFfv,Rainmaker Campaign Session 2 - Into the Desert,"Spoilers for Rainmaker ahead!

This week the 5th crewman joined the game; Doctor, a Transhumanist cyborg wannabe piloting a Spectrum mech called Toaster (the 3 heat cap really sucked when playing in the desert).

Shortly before the crawler ""Perserverance"" reached the drop off point for the salvage run, they ran into a couple of raider box wheels, one of which was stuck in the sand. The pilots took their mechs out to face the threat bit ended up helping the raiders get unstuck and sent them on their way. In return the raiders let them know about some easy pickings for scrap, a lonely hermit that lived somewhere to the north.

The crew moved on to the abandoned town that was supposed to be their first stop and found a bunch of scrap with no fuss at all. Riot got to use her Superior Salvager ability for the first time.

While heading North to meet the hermit, they almost crashed directly in a Contour Aerospace patrol. The corpos almost attack them expecting the crew to be water bandits but the crew managed to talk the Corpos down from violence and avoid fighting. The Corpos did advise the crew to contact Regional Director Marsh at the arcology, she always has work for mercs and salvage unions. 

Afterwards, the crew arrived near a hill top covered in trip wires and alarms with a set of small buildings clustered at the top and they were ready to be attacked but instead were greeted by Old Sand,bthe old merc pilot. Old Samd spent time with them trading stories, drinking something that could almost be called coffee and looking at the Paladin mech in the barn. He also shared a bit of info on the tensions between the infantry and mech pilots in the trading outpost nearby as well as Contour's relationship to Colton the Water Baron of the Drowned City.

Before moving on from here, the crew decided they wanted to find some of the water bandits and take them out. Doctor volunteered to act as bait, he shut down his mech on a gravelly plain and made it look abandoned while the others hid nearby.

Now I was expecting this encounter to be rough for the players, the water bandits are listed as 4x Legion Gopher mechs, they can dodge, the can use the nets to give out immobilised and vulnerable to any mechs and follow up with their 4SP green lasers. The tactics seemed simple enough, move to close range with one bandit and fire the net at the biggest seeming threat then the others follow up with the lasers until its dead. 

Thing is, the nets need to actually hit and I couldnt roll to save my life. No nets hit amd so the players started taking apart these Gophers one by one. The first round one gopher was destroyed and I kept them in the fight. Round 2 another one was destroyed and I decided the bandits wouldnt stick around and would try to run. Rouns 3 ANOTHER bandit died and the 4th got away, promising revenge over the radio.

After the dust settled, Riot managed to salvage a Gopher Chassis, Escape Protocols and a motion scanner, a very good haul. The crew headed back to the Perserverance with their loot and fixed up the Gopher for Airtime.

The session ran quite late and we had to rush the downtime stuff a bit but that was on me, I was letting them sit and roleplay a bunch which was great fun but Ill need to allow a bit of time for that in the future. Everyone reported having a good time though so ill call it a win. It was really satisfying to see the players start to flex their abilities amd mechs as they get used to the game.",3,1732101504.0,salvageunion,3,1.0,False

To explain a bit before starting the story. If you are bothered by gay things i rather you not to read this. Yes i’m a trans male (no operation done yet), under testosterone since 3rd of june(5months and 17 days) For the purpose of the story i’m going to call my date, Nathan for anonyma and because it’s simple. He already dated trans guys i’m not the first one.

So the story begins when me and my ex broke up, it was a toxic relationship that lasted two whole years. He finally broke up with me but wanted to take me back and i said no. (Keep this in mind it will be extremly important.) After a few weeks, my mom told me to download a dating app because she said that’s how she met her current boyfriend. I don’t like dating app usually but it was the time to test it out. So i download the app, make my profil and look through a few profile. A few cute girls and handsome man but nothing more interesting. I got a few matches talking a bit but nothing came out great until i met Nathan. I saw Nathan’s profil but i thought he was straight because he didn't have any sexual prepference on his profil so i passed on it when a few days later. He sent me a match, i was suprised and accepted it. He match the small icon where i said ‘you will like me if you like : videos games, movie nights or music (mostly any types)'. He send a message saying ‘hey, i love you hair handsome’. First of all i blushed hard and I was glad a man like him will be interested in a trans guy like me. So we started chatting together, smiling, flirting, he was rizzing me all the time before i could. Making cute comments and compliments. We talked a lot about everything and anything, he sended me a lot of memes since he is a shitposter which i clearly don’t mind. Then a few days later, we were on a late night call between 00:00 and 4:00 a.m. he told me where he was living but it didn’t match his current profil and this conversation begins.

Me : on your profil it says that you live in #### did you moved you to live un &&&&?

Nathan : no i’m just currently at my parents for the holydays but i will go back to #### tomorrow

Me : oh do you pass by the highway near €€€€?

Nathan : yeah i do actually why?

Me : my city is a few exit away maybe like 45 minute after €€€€ on the same highway

Nathan : really ? Maybe we could set something..

Me : oh i mean definitly.. wanna meet up at a bar in my city? For a coffee?

Nathan : yeah sure.. why not sounds great actually.. having a date with a cute guy

Then the conversation kept on and on with a lot of other subjects. So the day and the hour arrived, i lived maybe like five minutes away from the bar so i prepared myself and all making myself handsome, with a black trousers, DM boots turtleneck and a cardigan. It was my first date out of a relationship so i was so nervous and a bit sweaty at the moment. i arrived at the bar waiting on him i take out my stuff to smoke (yes i’m a smoker) and i start rollint myself a cigarette. He arrived a bit out of nowhere while i was doing my cigarrette and i saw a 6ft tall white male with a moustache really curly mid dark brown hair, he was a bit chubby but not problem with that and really beautiful hazel eyes who literally catch your breath. Nathan was damn handsome. So he seat with me and roll his cigarette and we smoke together and ordered a coffee and kept yapping laughing and he rizzed me a lot. The whole time my ex kept sending messages and calling me it was hell.

As the day goes by we decide to pay and go for a walk so we walk for a long time talking. Then arrives to the supposed end, i told him ‘when do you go home?’ He told me ‘anytime’ so we kept talking and by joking he said ‘what if you come by my flat’. I look at him seriously and i said ‘i have something plan but.. i can make an exception’. We both laughed and he go wait to his car while i go prepare my stuff, i was a bit scared i never really done that going to some stranger’s place after the first day but why not? So i arrived at his car, he ride the ride wasn’t much of a talk because he was concentrated on the road ‘cause it was night time. So we arrived at his place and it was a bit of a mess but it’s nothing i didn’t mind it at all. I put my stuff next to the bed, then he goes take a shower because he was sweaty and all. I waited smoking at his window (he told me i could because he always do it.) i finish my cigarettes and sit on his bed waiting because i needed the bathroom to change myself too. He finally comes back, i take my stuffs and go changing myself in the bathroom then comme back. I go on the bed and we start listening to music then watching memes, after that we laungh an frenchtuber (a french NightMind like if ykyk). We watch peacefully and after like 30 minutes he kissed me, a nice kiss. Then we stopped and jept on the video, watching cuddlint snuggling really affectionate and all. Then just a bit ago we started kissing a clearly more intense one a bit like making out, he knew i didn’t wanted to have sex that day so we didn’t but we kissed a lot and we cuddle a lot, both of us didn’t sleept more than at least two hours.

The morning Nathan was sick for no particular reason he was vomiting and all, i was doing my bed cuddling him and trying to be with him. I was a bit uncomfortable because i couldn’t really do much on the moment. Nathan felt bad being sick because he wanted to have a nice day with me but he was in bed all the moment then in the bathroom vomiting. Then my ex harrassed me again, i told Nathan ‘hey i’m sorry i’ll just take the call to say to him leave me alone’. Nathan just nodded and i was i. The hallway arguing with my ex it was hell again, then he heard Nathan vomiting and he knew what was happening and again he yeld and argue with me. After all that we finished the call, i didn’t wanted to leave Nathan alone too long so i came back. He said ‘i would definnatly make rice but i don’t have the energy’ i said ‘i can make some’ he was against it at first but then accepted it. I’m not a bad cook but i’m not the bed i do good dishes mostly, but i undercooked the rice and it felt terrible and stupid, he ate a bit saying ‘i can’t eat not because you cook it but because my stomach can’t take it’. i didn’t know if it was an excuse or not i didn’t push anything and i pack my stuff a few hours later to leave giving him a small kiss.

After that we both texted a bit by messages while i was going home but long replies because he was sleeping, vomiting and physically/mentally exhausted. It became a bit weird we texted for a few days after the date then one day he stopped texting, ghosting me leaving me on read. I tried to talk to him but always on seen so, when he was online i sended a message saying ‘what’s the ick did i do something?’ He said it was nothing i didn’t do anything wrong and he was just exhausted, he needed time to think about things and all. he told me he was sick all week.

Since then he didn’t send a text he left me on seen. i don't know what i did wrong in all i'm completly lost. does anyone can tell me what's wrong ? or maybe i'm just overthinking? it's been two weeks with no news and only my messages left on read. Should i propose to see each other again having another date ?

(sorry for the bad english i'm from France, so i'm sorry if there is grammar problems or else)

I haven’t been able to work over the last ten years, although I did step in to help with my(50f) boyfriend’s(63m) business when he needed help. He is extremely supportive when it comes to my health issues because we’ve been together for 27ish years, and he was recently diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Believe me, I’d haven been far more comfortable had he never been dx’d with RA, but what can you do?

Anyway, I’m in training until after the first of the year, so I’m not too stressed about training. What I AM worried about, though, are the days when everything hurts too much to get out of bed, the water will feel like a kajillion needles piercing my skin, and I know it’ll take me an hour or two to get moving after I take it. I’m proud of myself for making it through all the days up to today. I’m excited for new possibilities.  But I need to make sure I have all of the stuff I need to make it through the day?

I guess my question is this: what do I do on the days everything is too painful/bright/loud/ugly/swollen/etc? Or on the days where I start mainlining triple espresso shots from the fancy break room coffee machine because I am dragging ass. 

What are your experiences? How did getting back to work help you/make you feel?

Wanted to know if others have been observing this too, and what might be causing it?

Few years ago, the number of coffee bags I received having some roast defect (like underdeveloped roast, stalled or baked roast, etc.) were probably 1 out of 15. Given the complexities involved in production, processing and roasting coffee, such shortcomings or issues are completely understandable. And roasters have been super proactive and helpful to rectify the problem, barring say one or two instances for me personally.

But over the last 8 months or so, I've been noticing that many of the beans I've ordered are having issues with the roast profile! Around 5 out of my last 8 orders have had a problem of the roast being underdeveloped or baked, leading to a flat cup. No amount of resting or recipe tweaking has solved this. And this issue hasn't been limited to any one roaster in particular, but have seen this play out across multiple roasters, some of whom have been super reliable and consistent in the past!

Has anyone else been experiencing this too? Would love to get some insights and opinions from people who work in specialty coffee, to better understand this situation! ",5,1732100793.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

The second picture was took today, on the morning, before taking my coffee, my teeth was clean. It looks very gross. Let me be clear, yellow teeth is not a problem ! It's a normal color, but my teeth look *so dirty*.

My dentist told me that he can't do anything. It's normal due to my coffee consumption. It's all right because my oral health is perfect, but I LOOK gross.

**Length:** 8 episodes, up to 15 minutes each.

**Synopsis:** This story is based on two theories. One, that if we flirt with someone continuously for 21 days, there will be a chance that that person will start to be interested back. Two, we're able to forget exes if we break up for 11 months. 

Nune likes Vicky, a customer of the coffee shop. Nune talks about Vicky to Pie (Ferin) every day, which makes Pie annoyed. So, she challenges Nune to flirt with Vicky for 21 days. Nune accepts and finds ways to flirt with Vicky. Nune also challenges Pie back to forget Vava (Great), her ex-girlfriend in 21 days, because in 21 days it will be 11 months. Pie accepts the challenge thinking it will be easy. But, on that day, Vava appears at the coffee shop.

21 days... with hearts that just want to get closer.

First time poster here.

Would love to get input from you.

About me: Just turned 40 with wife in low paying job and 2 children 1 and 3 years. Been at the same company for 7 years. 

The situation: My current manager position is being made redundant, but the company has offered me another role which is different(non managerial), but being allowed to keep the same compensation package. 

If I'm not to take up the new offered role, I'll have to leave the company, but the company will have to pay me a severance package of 12 months salary.

The company is expected to close all its activities in the next few years, meaning I'll have to find a new job anyway...

Pros and cons about the company:
Pros: 
*Allowed to work from home 2 out of 5 days
*Holiday package is one of the best in the industry in the country I'm from (6 weeks)
*Up to a week of child sick days, where I can stay at home with the sick child and get full pay. 
*High pension paid by the company
*Easy to get to the office through high way with little to no traffic
*Relatively good salary (~9,5k USD pr month) plus year end bonus and pension and paid holiday
*Health and dental insurance
*Free fruits and coffee

Cons:
*Salary increase is low
*Opportunity for personal growth is low
*Workload can be high at times
*Overtime not compensated in cash (You can leave earlier on a day with low workload)
*Could be a dead end job relating to the new role due to low opportunity for growth


Arguments/reasons to choose to leave with severance package:
I kind of grown tired of the company for the wrong decisions it has made over the last 5 years leading the company to its demise. Secondly, some colleagues who wants to take the severance package are not allowed to for the foreseeable time, because their position is still needed, but once a different person is able to free up the want away person's time, then he would be able to leave with the severance. So if I were to take up this offered role, I might get stuck in the company for a longer time and won't be able to get the severance package even if I wanted to at a later stage... Lastly, would be good to change the environment and look for more interesting jobs. 

Downside of this choice is that I need to find a new job, and I'd prefer that the compensation package is more or less in line or better. Lack of clarity for what the near future brings. 

Arguments/reasons to choose to stay and take up new role:
Stability and being able to take care of my kids, when they get sick and still be able to enjoy the perks of the company. Knowing what the day brings in the near future. 

The downside of this might be that I'll be demotivated in the job and stuck in the company unless I quit, where I won't get the severance package. Giving up opportunities of applying for more interesting jobs while getting a nice payout.

The downside of this might be that I'll be demotivated in the job and stuck in the company unless I quit, where I won't get the severance package. Giving up opportunities of applying for more interesting jobs while getting a nice payout.

I have tried a few medium roasts (haven't got any light roasts around). I will admit I am very much a beginner with good grinders and will most definitely not take offense if this all comes down to user error so please educate me if anyone has this grinder and has had more success.

Q1 - BUT I am really struggling with the bellows moving the adjustment ring. I have tried and had relative success with a 2 handed approach but after running a heap of beans through the machine I am confident I want to grind straight into the portafilter which makes 2 handed operation impossible. If I use the bellows very very carefully it will only move less then 0.1 of an increment but from my experience that margin significantly changes the grind. This leads onto my second question...

Q2 - This grinder is designed for all ranges of coffee BUT in the region of expresso I am finding 2-2.5 on the first level of rotation to be the usable region. This seems like a really small window for a grinder of this scope. I have pulled the burrs out and dusted ensuring it is aligned correctly (I haven't done the pen test yet but don't believe this is needed with this machine).

Any help would be much appreciated LOVING this grinder so far but just a few nit picks I am hoping someone can allude too a solution (even if it involves hanging my head in shame!)

The first time I noticed something strange was one summer evening last year. Mom was in the shower and called for me to bring her a new bar of soap.

I grabbed a fresh bar, pushed the bathroom door open slightly, and handed it in. A hand reached out and took it, the door quickly closing behind it.

Satisfied, I went back to my room, put on my headphones, and resumed working on my essay.

Not long after, I heard her voice again.

""Anna! Anna!""

I pulled off one headphone and shouted back, ""What now?""

""The soap! Bring me the soap!""

Frustrated, I stomped over to the bathroom door and peeked inside. ""What are you talking about? I just gave it to you!""

Through the steam, my mom glared at me, her hair foamy with shampoo. ""What soap? I’ve been waiting!""

Confused, I pointed at the door. ""I handed it to you. Just now. You took it.""

She squinted, clearly annoyed. ""Don’t play games with me, Anna. There’s no new soap in here!""

I glanced at the soap dish, which held nothing but a tiny used-up sliver. My stomach twisted.

If she didn’t take the soap, who did?

 

2.

That night, my stomach growled as I lay scrolling through food videos. The sight of a fluffy chocolate cake made my mouth water. Deciding I couldn’t resist, I crept into the kitchen to grab a slice of Napoleon cake from the fridge.

Just as I reached for the fridge door, a strange crunching sound came from the corner. I froze.

Turning my head, I saw her—Mom, crouched in the shadows, her face pale in the faint moonlight streaming through the window. She was chewing on something, her posture hunched like an animal guarding its prey.

""Mom?"" I called softly.

Her head snapped up, her mouth full of food. She grinned at me, her lips smeared with grease, a string of saliva clinging to the bone she held.

I turned on the light, the harsh fluorescent glow revealing her gaunt face, sunken eyes with dark circles, and the messy heap of gnawed bones at her feet.

""Mom, what are you doing?""

""I was hungry,"" she replied, her tone light, almost playful.

Her gaze darted around nervously. ""What are you doing up?"" she asked.

""I wanted some cake,"" I said, pointing to the fridge, suddenly unsure if I should stay.

She chuckled softly. ""Go on, then. Take your cake. But eat it in your room.""

As I left with my dessert, I glanced back. She had resumed gnawing on the bones with a feral intensity, like she hadn’t eaten in weeks.

 

3.

The next morning, Mom opened the fridge and frowned. ""Where are all the beef bones I cooked yesterday? Half of them are gone!""

Her accusing eyes landed on me. ""Anna, were you sneaking food again?""

I couldn’t believe her nerve. ""Me? You were the one eating them last night! I saw you!""

She looked genuinely angry. ""Don’t make things up! Eating late at night is bad for you, and I never do it. Stop lying to cover your bad habits!""

The argument escalated until she was yelling and I was on the verge of tears. But no matter how much I insisted, she refused to admit what I’d seen.

 

4.

A few days later, Mom decided to clean out the basement. Our apartment came with a storage space beneath the building—a dark, unfinished basement where we kept unused furniture, tools, and food supplies.

Late in the morning, she called me to bring the old bicycle from outside into the basement.

The basement was damp and cold, lit by a single flickering bulb. Dust hung in the air like a shroud, and the walls seemed to close in as I descended the creaky stairs.

I spotted Mom crouched in the corner, rummaging through a crate. She didn’t turn around when I called to her.

""Mom, I brought the bike.""

""Just leave it by the stairs,"" she muttered without looking up.

I hesitated. ""Need help with anything else?""

""No!"" she snapped, startling me.

I noticed a torn packet of instant noodles at her feet, its contents spilled everywhere. Half-eaten dry noodles and flavoring powder littered the ground. The air smelled faintly of artificial beef seasoning.

""Mom, are you… eating raw noodles?""

Before she could respond, a voice called from above.

""Anna! Did you bring the bike down yet?""

My blood froze.

The voice was Mom’s.

But it hadn’t come from the woman in front of me.

I turned slowly toward the stairs. There, framed by the dim light, stood another version of my mother.

""Anna, what’s taking so long?"" she asked again, her tone sharp.

My head snapped back to the woman crouched by the food crate. She was now standing, staring at me with wide, unblinking eyes. Her mouth curled into a crooked smile.

I turned back to the stairs. The second Mom began descending toward me, her footsteps echoing ominously.

Two identical figures. Two identical faces.

I stumbled backward, my heart racing. Which one was my real mom?

5.

I bolted out the door and wandered aimlessly through the bustling streets, feeling completely lost.

Even though the sun blazed overhead, my whole body was icy cold, as if I were trapped in the middle of Antarctica.

There were two mothers in the basement.

It was impossible.

And yet, I knew what I had seen—clear as day, undeniable. There were two mothers down there.

The more I thought about it, the more terrified I became.

I wanted to ask someone for help, but who could I turn to? Who would believe something so absurd?

Then it hit me. I did know someone who might take me seriously—a high school classmate of mine.

He was a self-proclaimed expert in the occult, a jack-of-all-trades when it came to the weird and unexplained. UFOs, crop circles, Bigfoot, Bermuda Triangle—he studied them all. He also had a fascination with concepts like dreams within dreams, possessions, past-life memories, and parallel dimensions. He’d even mutter about “human-like creatures hiding among the crowd.”

Most people dismissed him as a kook.

But I’d always had a healthy respect for the unknown, so I never mocked him. In fact, we got along pretty well. Now, his bizarre knowledge felt like my last hope.

I pulled out my phone, found his number, and called him in a panic.

After hearing my story, he suggested we meet at a nearby coffee shop.

Once there, I poured out everything that had happened—every odd detail about my mom’s recent behavior and what I saw in the basement.

He adjusted his glasses and stared at me seriously. “So… you’re saying you saw two mothers in the basement?”

I nodded emphatically. “Yes, two! I’m sure of it!”

His face grew darker. After a long pause, he finally said, “When you find two mothers in your house… it means there are already tens of thousands hiding in the shadows.”

My mind went blank. A chill raced up my spine, and I almost screamed.

“T-tens of thousands?” I stammered.

He shook his head. “The number is just a placeholder. In reality, it could be hundreds of thousands.”

I imagined the scene—an endless sea of mothers packed into my home—and felt a wave of nausea. My chest tightened, and I nearly cried.

“How is that possible?” I whimpered.

“It’s a virus,” he said grimly.

“A virus?”

“Yes. A highly contagious one. Once someone is infected, they begin to reproduce uncontrollably—splitting and multiplying, like roaches filling every dark corner.”

He leaned closer, lowering his voice. “It parasitizes humans, causing them to divide—one becomes two, two become four, four become eight, and so on.The point is, it spreads exponentially, and once it starts, it’s nearly impossible to stop. These… duplicates hide in dark places. If you’ve already seen two, that means your home is infested.”

The word infested made my stomach churn. Infested with… mothers?

“What should I do?” I asked desperately.

He offered two solutions.

“First,” he said, “burn your house down. Torch everything inside, including your mother and her duplicates.”

I recoiled. “But what about my real mom? She’s still in there!”

“Burn her too. If you don’t, she’ll just keep multiplying.”

“No!” I shouted. “I can’t burn her! And what about the other tenants in the building? If the fire spreads, I’ll be held responsible!”

He scratched his chin. “Fair point. Then you’ll have to go with option two.”

“What’s option two?”

“Leave. Disinfect yourself thoroughly, pack only the essentials, and move out. Make sure to sterilize everything you bring with you—use alcohol to wipe down every surface. Once you reach your new home, sanitize yourself and your belongings again to ensure the virus doesn’t spread.”

I stared at him, stunned. “You’re telling me to run away?”

“Yes,” he said firmly. “And you must cut off all contact with your mother. Block her number, delete her from your life. If she tries to call you from another number, hang up immediately. If she messages you through someone else’s account, ignore it.”

“So, you’re saying I can’t talk to her or see her ever again?”

“Exactly.”

“But what if she has an emergency? What if she’s in danger?”

“Let her handle it,” he said coldly. “If you reach out to her—even once—the virus will find its way to you. It spreads not just through physical contact but also through sound. Even hearing her voice could allow it to infect you, by planting harmful thoughts in your mind and weakening your emotional defenses.

“This virus targets family members first—especially direct relatives. Its goal is to break you down, and once you’re broken, it’ll infect you too. Then you’ll start multiplying as well.”

He adjusted his glasses again. “If the virus has no one to latch onto, it will eventually weaken and die. Once that happens, your mom will recover. The duplicates will dissolve, and everything will return to normal. Only then can you safely go back to her.”

“How long will that take?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Prepare to wait ten or twenty years.”

My heart sank. Ten or twenty years without my mom?

6.

By nightfall, I had returned home.

Mom had prepared a table full of food and called me to eat, but I ignored her.

Two choices lay before me:

First, stay with my mom and try to figure out a way to deal with these duplicates.

Second, follow the occultist’s advice and leave—never looking back.

I leaned toward the first option. After all, she was my mother—the person I loved the most. Growing up, I had relied on her for everything. Now that something terrible had happened to her, whether it was an illness or some unknown virus, it was my responsibility to help her.

I couldn’t just abandon her.

But the thought of facing those duplicates terrified me.

If I left her behind with those creatures, wouldn’t that make me a terrible daughter? What if something happened to her? What if she got hurt?

I’d lose her forever.

The thought twisted my insides into knots.

That night, I decided to have an honest conversation with Mom. Maybe we could clear up any misunderstandings, and I could make my final decision.

I stepped out of my room, but before I could speak, Mom grabbed my arm and shouted, “Anna! Haven’t you had enough of this nonsense?”

I froze, staring at her face. A question surfaced in my mind: Was this really my mom?

She took a deep breath and softened her tone, holding my hand and looking at me with a mix of sadness and concern. “What’s wrong with you lately?”

I instinctively pulled my hand away.

“Anna, are you cursed or something?” she asked, tears pooling in her eyes. “Just tell me the truth. Are you really confused, or are you messing with me on purpose?”

“What are you talking about?” I asked.

“That night,” she said, her voice trembling, “you ate the beef bones, didn’t you? Why won’t you admit it? Did you forget, or are you afraid I’d scold you? And what about the soap? I asked you to bring me a bar, but you didn’t, and then you lied, saying you did. Why, Anna? Were you just trying to upset me?”

Her eyes glistened with tears as she looked at me, her tone unusually serious.

I stared back at her, unflinching. “But you did eat the bones. I saw you with my own eyes!”

She suddenly pulled me into her arms and sobbed uncontrollably.

“Anna, don’t scare me, okay? Are you sick? Tomorrow, I’ll take you to the doctor,” she cried. “Just tell me—what happened at noon? Why did you run out without a word? Why didn’t you answer your phone or eat the food I made? Are you trying to kill me with worry?”

I took a deep breath. “I saw two of you in the basement.”

Her reaction was what I was waiting for. I searched her face, hoping to catch a flicker of fear or guilt.

“What?” she asked, genuinely confused. “Two of me?”

“Yes,” I replied. “One far away and one up close. One was expressionless, and the other was smiling. Both of them were staring at me. Didn’t you see it yourself?”

“Anna, what nonsense are you spouting?” she said, narrowing her eyes at me like I was insane.

“I’m not making this up! In the basement—there was another person who looked exactly like you!”

“You… saw someone who looked exactly like me?”

“Yes! I saw two of you!”

Mom stared at me for a long time, her face growing pale. She suddenly let go of me, her expression hollow, as if she had aged ten years in an instant.

When I tried speaking to her again, she didn’t respond, as if she hadn’t even heard me.

Finally, she muttered weakly, “Go to your room. Tomorrow, I’ll take you to see a doctor.”

Then she picked up her phone and began typing.

Before I left, I snuck a glance at her screen. She had typed into the search bar: What illness causes hallucinations in children?

8.

Back in my room, I reviewed everything I knew so far.

According to the occultist, my mom was infected with a virus that caused her to multiply endlessly.

But Mom believed I was the one seeing things—that there was something wrong with me. She was even planning to take me to a doctor.

As for the occultist—was he really trustworthy? Could his theories be true?

Earlier, I had asked him how he knew about this so-called virus.

He said, “Experts around the world have studied this phenomenon extensively, but governments suppress the information to prevent mass panic. The media doesn’t report on it, so the public remains unaware.

“I’ve got access to sources most people don’t. Cases like yours? I’ve seen plenty. When you said you saw two of your mother, I knew immediately—it’s a textbook example of this virus.”

Then he went on: “The virus was first discovered in the 19th century, in a small village in Yorkshire, England. A young girl named Susan noticed her mother multiplying—first into two, then four, then eight—until the duplicates filled their tiny home.

“She ran into the streets for help but was dismissed as a lunatic and locked away.

“The case caught the attention of London’s medical community. Doctors extracted a virus from Susan’s mother and discovered its horrifying reproductive properties. They named it the Infinite Mother Virus.

“Most of this information is classified, but I’m telling you because of our friendship. You mustn’t share this with anyone else, Anna.”

Now, sitting alone in my room, his words played over in my mind.

Could they really be true?

The idea of thousands of mothers multiplying endlessly sounded absurd. But the two I’d seen in the basement? That had felt very real.

Should I trust the occultist… or my mom?

Doubt gnawed at me.

I turned on my computer and searched online for “Infinite Mother Virus.” Nothing came up.

I tried “seeing two mothers at once,” but all I found were medical forums discussing double vision, astigmatism, and cataracts—complete with ads for corrective glasses.

Frustrated, I scratched my head.

Then an idea struck me: What if I searched the house?

If there really were other mothers hiding here, I’d find them. I’d touch them, prod them, and confirm whether they were real.

If it was all a hallucination, I wouldn’t feel anything.

Satisfied with my plan, I waited until late at night, making sure Mom was asleep before slipping out of my room.

Peeking through the crack in her door, I saw her lying in bed, snoring softly.

To avoid waking her, I kept the lights off, using my phone’s flashlight to scan the floors and walls as I crept through the hallway, the living room, and the kitchen.

I checked the cabinets, the fridge, the oven—nothing.

I moved to the bathroom, opening the cabinet, the washing machine, even the toilet lid. Still, nothing.

I crouched to look under the sofa and coffee table, inhaling a lungful of dust that made me stifle a cough.

Trying to lure them out, I whispered softly:

“Mom? Mom?”

“Come out… there’s some tasty beef bones here…”

“Mmm… smells so good, Mom. Come out and eat!”

But there was no response. Only my eerie whispers echoed in the dark.

Finally, I reached the basement.

The pitch-black space swallowed the light from my phone. I fumbled for the light switch.

Suddenly, my foot caught on something, and I stumbled, nearly falling. Grabbing the wall for support, I flipped the switch.

The light flickered on.

And in that moment, sheer terror flooded every vein in my body.

Before me was a scene so grotesque, so impossible, it defied all reason.

So, I (25, f) had a kind of unpleasant conversation with two friends of mine let’s say Anna (25, f) and Tom (26, m) and I don’t want to just let it slide. 

I was thinking about renting out my small apartment  for 3 days because someone via a Plattform showed interest. I asked Anna and Tom If they think it’s a good idea. I am a Student, working 20 hours/ week and getting a little support from my mum, but it’s not too much, so every little money is highly highly appreciated and tbh needed. especially because from December on I can only afford working 11 hours because of my studies I just started which is very time consuming and study intense. You can skip directly to the situation (“So back to the story”), I’ll just offer a little more context and background informations about my friends background. 

For context/my friends background:
Anna is also a student but taking it very very slow and hasn’t finished her bachelor yet (so has a lot of free time during the week) apart from also working 20 hours/week.
but I think/know she’s getting a lot more support than I do. I don’t know exactly how much, we didn’t talk about exact numbers  but she a few times said she’s very privileged. Her father is a landlord and I know he earns a lot, she orders new clothes about every month, goes out almost every weekend two clubs/ bars and buys expensive drinks, getting a new MacBook directly after hers was stolen, goes out for coffee and cake about twice a week, lives in a room that costs 750€/month, (average here for people in our age group and situation is 500/month). I’ve only once in 5 years of friendship heard her say she has to “watch money”. 

Tom has a wealthy family background . Let’s just say he will be given 200.000€ by his mum in a couple of months because she is selling one of their holiday apartments and splitting the money between herself and her three sons evenly.  That’s probably enough explanation.

My father is homeless, my mum works an average job and earns just the average. We are not poor and I would call myself privileged as well as I am lucky to be supported at lol, but money has always been a topic in our family having to “watch the money.”

My friends know about this and money has never been an issue in our friends group, apart from that I sometimes just can’t have that many drinks when we go out, not order coffee, bringing my own drinks to the Christmas market (lol) or not go out at all. They sometimes invite me, but as I feel guilty I always invite them back at another time so it’s more or less balanced out, a little to my “advantage”. And yes, I catch myself being a little jealous of them at Times which i am not proud of, but I am also very happy for them as they are wonderful and dear friends. 

So back to the story; 
I asked them if they think it’s a good idea to rent out for three days for 60€ (maybe a little more) to get some extra money. And she started saying: wouldn’t do it, that’s too little for too much potential stress. That it wasn’t enough money for that. Everything fine until that point.
As I told them it wasn’t stressful because I would not have to barely anything  and just get a little extra money she said she “wouldn’t t even get out of bed for 60€”. Tom kind of agreed.
At the end ending the conversation with “but maybe we are in a different circumstances than you.” 

The first comment bothered and still bothers me.
This on it’s own wouldn’t have been too much of a problem, but the last couple of weeks in two situations she said “I wouldn’t work for less then 15€” or/and “for less than 15€ I stay at home” (minimum wage here is 12,50€) and I just find it kind of disrespectful.

I don’t know if I’m overreacting, but 60€ for me is a lot, and talking it down like it’s nothing, and even making me almost feel bad for potentially doing this for “that little money” just feels shitty. 
I don’t know what to do know, I wish I said something during the conversation, now it feels weird to make a fuzz about it afterwards. What do you think?

I’ve got a confession to make.

For years, I struggled with something I never thought would become a daily battle. It started small—an ache here, a twinge there. But before I knew it, my knees creaked louder than my morning coffee maker. Walking up a flight of stairs felt like scaling Everest. Forget jogging or chasing after the grandkids. I was sidelined from the life I wanted to live, and it wasn’t just frustrating—it was soul-crushing.

I tried everything. Creams, pills, special exercises—you name it, I gave it a shot. Some worked… temporarily. Most were just glorified placebos. Then I found it. Something different. Something that didn’t just mask the pain but went straight to the root of the problem.

At first, I was skeptical. After all, I’d been burned before. But the science behind this blew me away. It wasn’t just some random collection of ingredients slapped on a label. It was a formula designed to replenish what time had slowly stolen from my joints. The secret? A focus on restoring synovial fluid. You know, that magical stuff your joints need to stay cushioned and pain-free.

After just one week, I noticed something—my mornings were different. That usual stiffness that greeted me when I swung my legs out of bed? Gone. Week two, and I wasn’t dreading those stairs anymore. By the end of the month, I found myself doing things I hadn’t done in years. Dancing with my partner. Playing soccer with my grandson. Even tackling a hike I had given up on years ago.

And here’s the kicker—it wasn’t just the pain that disappeared. I felt younger. Like my body was finally working with me instead of against me. My energy came roaring back, and the mental fog that chronic discomfort had draped over my life cleared up like a storm passing.

I’m not saying this will turn you into an Olympic athlete overnight. But if you’re someone who’s tired of feeling like a prisoner in your own body, this is the lifeline you’ve been waiting for. It’s more than a supplement; it’s a second chance.

If you’re sitting there wondering if this could work for you, let me ask you this: how much longer are you willing to wait? How many more days, weeks, or years are you going to let pain control your life? You’ve already read this far, which tells me you’re ready for a change.

The best part? There’s no risk in trying. I can tell you all day about how it turned my life around, but nothing compares to experiencing it for yourself. So here’s my challenge to you: give it a shot. What’s the worst that can happen? You stay exactly where you are now?

Trust me—your future self will thank you. Because there’s nothing better than waking up and realizing that the life you thought you’d lost is waiting for you on the other side of one small decision.

Let’s talk science for a moment—because I get it. When it comes to health, you don’t want fluff, you want facts. That’s exactly what sold me on this product in the first place: the science behind it is rock solid.

Here’s what you need to know. The key player in this formula is something called **hyaluronan**. Ever heard of it? Don’t worry if you haven’t—I hadn’t either until I did some digging. Hyaluronan is like the unsung hero of your joints. It’s the molecule that keeps your synovial fluid—the natural lubricant in your joints—hydrated, thick, and cushiony.

Think of synovial fluid as the oil in your car engine. Over time, the “oil” in your joints starts to break down. That’s where the problems begin. Without enough hyaluronan, your joints lose their natural cushioning, leading to stiffness, discomfort, and that dreaded bone-on-bone grinding feeling. That’s the science of aging joints.

Now here’s the kicker: most joint supplements out there don’t even touch this problem. They focus on slapping a band-aid on the symptoms with basic stuff like glucosamine or chondroitin. And while those might help a little, they don’t address the *real* root cause—the breakdown of hyaluronan and the resulting lack of proper lubrication in your joints.

This formula is different. It’s powered by **Mobilee®**, a patented ingredient that’s been clinically proven to increase hyaluronan levels by a staggering 10X. That’s not marketing hype—it’s backed by real studies. And it’s not just about restoring lubrication; it also supports joint tissue regeneration, which is key to long-term relief and resilience.

But it doesn’t stop there. This formula goes the extra mile with a blend of powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients. Why? Because joint pain isn’t just about wear and tear—it’s also about inflammation. Chronic inflammation can wreak havoc on your body, making every movement a battle. By combining hyaluronan-boosting Mobilee® with inflammation-fighting ingredients, this formula works from every angle.

What really blew my mind was how fast it worked. Unlike some products where you have to wait months to feel anything, I noticed a difference within weeks. The science explains why: when your joints finally get the nutrients they’ve been starving for, they respond quickly. It’s like giving a thirsty plant water—it perks right back up.

And here’s one last piece of science for you: hyaluronan isn’t just good for your joints. It’s also incredible for your skin, your eyes, and even your energy levels. So while I originally tried this product for my aching knees, I quickly realized it was doing so much more. My skin looked healthier, my focus improved, and I felt younger from the inside out.

This isn’t magic—it’s biology. When you give your body what it truly needs, it rewards you. That’s why this product stands out. It’s not about masking pain or offering temporary relief; it’s about empowering your body to heal and protect itself, just like it was designed to do.

If you’ve been looking for a solution rooted in science, not gimmicks, this is it. The results speak for themselves. And honestly? The hardest part about this journey wasn’t taking the first dose—it was wondering why I waited so long to start.

# 1. How long does it take to work?

You’ll start noticing changes within a few weeks, but the beauty of this formula is that it gets better with time. The longer you take it, the more it helps replenish your hyaluronan levels and rebuild your joint health from the inside out. For me, the biggest transformations showed up after about a month.

# 2. Is it safe?

Absolutely. The formula is doctor-designed and packed with natural, clinically proven ingredients. There are no harsh chemicals, fillers, or additives to worry about. Plus, it’s manufactured in facilities that meet the highest quality standards. If you’ve got specific health concerns, you should always consult your doctor first—but I can tell you I felt 100% confident putting this into my routine.

# 3. What makes it different from other joint supplements?

Most joint supplements rely on outdated, surface-level ingredients like glucosamine or chondroitin. While those can offer minor relief, they don’t tackle the root cause—depleted hyaluronan and poor joint lubrication. This formula’s focus on hyaluronan and the inclusion of Mobilee® set it apart. It’s not just about masking symptoms; it’s about fixing the real problem.

# 4. Do I need to take it forever?

Here’s the thing: once you experience how good your joints feel, you won’t want to stop. But this isn’t about dependency—it’s about maintaining the health you’ve rebuilt. Think of it like eating well or exercising: consistency matters. That said, you’ll likely find that your need for other solutions—like pain meds or topical treatments—drops dramatically.

# 5. What if it doesn’t work for me?

This was a big one for me. What happens if it’s just another dud? Thankfully, there’s zero risk. The company offers a money-back guarantee, so if you don’t see the results you’re hoping for, you’re covered. That’s a rare level of confidence, and it gave me the nudge I needed to try it.

# 6. Can it help someone with severe joint issues?

While everyone’s experience will vary, the science behind this product supports its ability to help even those with more advanced joint discomfort. The key is consistency. Over time, it works to rebuild what’s been lost. I’ve read countless testimonials from people with long-standing joint issues who’ve seen incredible improvements.

# 7. Is it just for older adults?

Not at all. While it’s especially popular with those in their 50s, 60s, and beyond, anyone dealing with joint discomfort can benefit. Whether you’re an active person who’s starting to feel the strain, or someone who’s been struggling for years, this product has something to offer.

I am looking into upgrading my home espresso set up and looking for recommendations for espresso machines that do well with very light roasts. I am just moving back to the US and am coming back with nothing but my pour over set up. I primarily brew beans coming out of the Nordics and it is almost always on the very light side. My drink of choice is an espresso tonic but other than that I split pretty evenly between milk drinks and americanos. I had been eying the linea mini for a while but heard that it does not handle lighter roasts as well. I had also heard good things about slayer but do not want to have a whole plumbing set up. I drink a lot of coffee and make a lot more for friends and family daily. Does anyone have any recommendations for machines that might fit my needs? I already have a great grinder!

1gvmk64,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyadvice/comments/1gvmk64/am_i_wrong_for_cutting_off_an_abusive_partner_or/,Am I wrong for cutting off an abusive partner or should I try and fix the situation? ,"I (40m) was in an on-off relationship with my gf ""B"" (32f) for the past 2 years. For the first six months, we dated monogamously and were pretty exclusive. At some point we decided we didn't want to see each other exclusively and decided to part ways amicably. 3 or 4 months later, we started seeing each other again and the topic of monogamy and sex positivity came up and after lots of discussion, research, and trying to understand each other's needs, we decided to give polyamory and being in an open relationship a go. 

Initially we set our boundaries to be that we would see other people separately, and explore the sex positive party scene in our city (a big metropolitan centre in Europe) together - i.e. going to swinger/play parties and sex clubs together. Over time we would check in with each other but in the beginning we didn't really disclose to each other much about other people we were seeing on a casual basis - both of us had this agreement that we would operate on a don't ask don't tell basis. She had multiple other casual partners as did I. 

At some point, as we were planning our first play party experience, she admitted to me that she had gone out to experience a swinger club with another guy as she didn't feel secure enough doing so with me. It initially felt like a betrayal given we had discussed it as an experience we would do together. She was quick to point out that they didn't really play with anyone else and that it was more out of curiosity and so we washed it under the bridge.

Over time we went to many play events, got comfortable to the point of soft swapping with other couples. Both of us had dropped seeing other people to focus on our relationship together and as a result we were monogamous for much of March to August of this year. In August we had a check-in talk where I bought up the topic of wanting to be CNM (i.e. playing with others together as opposed to separately) given that we hadn't been seeing other people. She agreed and asked why I wasn't seeing other people to which I answered that I hadn't had the time because of work, and also because I was focusing my energy on cultivating our bond together. 

However, after that day in August she came back to me and said that her takeaway from our conversation was that I would date other people if I had the time, and so its only fair that she should continue doing so, and then arranged to go on 6 or 7 dates with other men in a span of 2 weeks - whether it was for validation or otherwise, I'm not sure. I was largely OK with it given we are polyamorous and open. 

During this time, I figured that since she was dating, I should too, and rekindled an old relationship with a girl (i'll call her A) whom I used to see seriously in the past, but had parted ways and we rekindled our relationship on the basis that it was now going to be a casual affair. I told B and suddenly she didn't like this. I mentioned to her that I was only seeing one person while she was going on many dates but her idea was that I could have an emotional connection with A. Over time, our fights grew about the topic and she gave me an ultimatum that I need to cut A out of my life or she would leave. 

There were other times when I started dating again where I would mention that I was going on a date with another woman and she would keep blowing up my phone, asking me to come see her and drop what I was doing; using the threat of calling another guy to her house for a booty call as bait to get me to drop my date and come over to hers for the night. 

The last few months were toxic with this kind of status quo. It came to a head when she was going on holiday 2 weeks ago and we had bought tickets from a while to a swinger/sex party held in a large private residence - a fairly famous ""scene"" party for the city we live in. We decided to set our differences aside and go to this event as a way to enjoy the night before she traveled and hence take a break from our relationship. 

We were chatting to a bunch of people and the night was going well for a few hours. I randomly started chatting to couple that were coincidentally from the same ethnic origin as A as I was waiting for B to come back from the toilet. As soon as she arrived at the bar she threw a fit saying I’m triggering her insecurities because she knows this couple is from a similar ethnic background to A, and said something along the lines of ""use your head and gauge you know I’m sensitive to this …"".  I was like we are just chatting to random people at a bar... she threw a fit and I spent the better part of the rest of the night walking on eggshells. 

Anyway fast forward to next morning we were talking in bed with coffee and I brought up the fact that she shouldn’t be putting boundaries on who I can talk to and who I can’t and she got super angry. She stood up, took my stuff and threw it out the door, threw my cologne bottle at me which smashed and broke into pieces on the floor next to me, and also chucked the remains of a half eaten McDonalds meal at me, screamed at me to get the f out of the house, really over the top behaviour. She went into the kitchen and for a second I froze as I thought she was going to get a knife or some other sharp object to attack me but she only went into the kitchen to get tissue to clean up the floor (and not me). 

While we were arguing, I said some unsavoury things I will admit: I said that I can't cut off my other girl because I have started to love A the same way I love B, which B didn't like. At this point, she opened the door and asked me to leave - naked - into the hall. By this time, the neighbours had opened up their doors and were asking what was happening (she lives in a block of flats). I got changed in the hall, left downstairs to a coffee shop close by to get coffee and collect my thoughts.   
  
I went back to try and mend things but she wouldn’t open her door. Then later on she kept texting me and blaming me for saying I lead her on and that I still love Aga etc etc. And like the next day she flew to Mexico on holiday and she just kept texting every day and i wouldn’t respond and then she’d get even worse over text like I’m ruining her peace and her mind etc etc a lot of emotional stuff  
  
At some point I was like this is too toxic, I got kicked out of her house, she got physical with me and she’s making me apologise for it and I thought fuck if I go back it’s just gonna be worse. I can’t go back after she’s been physically abusive like that  
  
I blocked her on Saturday… I’d been getting a constant stream of messages from her all week when I had literally sent like 5 - just blaming me for everything, saying I’d ruined her holiday, calling me names, accusing me of emotional abuse and silent treatment… 

I still love her though, I don't know why she keeps playing on my mind and I get the feeling that all this toxicity was coming from a place of caring if that sounds sane enough to say. I'm a 6'1"" man with a background in MMA and boxing whereas she's a petite 5'4"", and so the physical violence is not something that really bothered me in a purely physical sense. Conceptually though, all my friends and family are telling me to run for the hills as this is too much toxicity and she's being coercive and abusive, and that I'm lucky to have escaped this relationship unscathed physically. 

I still have this longing and this feeling about what could have been and what should have been - we were very good together - she's very pretty, we are of similar backgrounds and life experiences, gelled very well, brought out the best in each other, dipped our toes into the lifestyle together and there was a lot on our agenda to expereince and discover. But when things turned bad, we would bring out the worst in each other too. 

Am I the jerk for cutting it off? Should I go back and try and mend things? or should I heed friends and family advice and take a clean break?

We matched last week Thursday and then went on a coffee date on Saturday just to get to know each other. We talked a lot and i enjoyed our conversation and he told me he enjoyed my company and the fact that i talk a lot lol, I ended up going home late around 10pm. Anyways we planned to see each other again the following day and we met around 5pm but we didn’t really have plans cause a lot of places were closed on a Sunday evening and we both don’t drink so we went on a drive and he was just showing me his neighbourhood, we live in the same town just 5miles from each other. 

After then he asked if he could show me his place and i agreed, he showed me his house and its a nice place, he is so smart and organised which is good. We just sat on the couch and talked for three good hours, we talked a lot about a lot of things up until 9pm when he asked me if i wanted to get something to eat outside or he can make us something to eat and i told him to just cook something quick and he made pesto tomato pasta and chicken breasts, it was so good. 

Then he loaded his dish washer and we went back to sit on the couch. He then asked to kiss me and we had a great make out session, i have never kissed anyone for that long before. Both of us enjoyed it so much and he couldn’t stop kissing me, he didn’t ask or suggest anything more which is great. He ended up dropping me off at home a few minutes before 12am i know its crazy but i both of us had a great time and if it was for me I would have spent more time with him but i respect my mom. 

Today we are going on another date again and both of us are so excited about it. We have got a lot of things in common and the same values, i just think we are compatible even though i haven’t known him for a long time.

Now i think i love him, idk if its love or i am just excited cause he is someone new but i don’t think thats the case cause I have never felt this way for someone in my life before. Normally i take at least a month to get to know someone before dating them but with him i just feel like i want to be in an official relationship with him already which sounds so fast compared to what i do. We both want a relationship, obviously there are some signs but idk how he is feeling exactly about this cause i never asked nor have we talked about it yet and i am not gonna suggest to make things official this early cause i don’t wanna seem pushy and also i want to get to know him more but my feelings are just getting stronger. 

I honestly don’t know what to do😭😭😭
