For context: we‚Äôve only met once for coffee, and we were supposed to grab lunch before I left for a trip to Paris. Here‚Äôs how the texts went:

Him:
‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to check those out!
Also super sorry, I got called in to cover a daytime shift tomorrow so can‚Äôt make it to lunch ‚òπÔ∏è maybe we can do a rain check for when you get back from Paris.‚Äù
Me:
‚ÄúNo worries! Yah totally I am back in Boston the 13th. Also, it may be a bit hastened but if u r available today I could sneak out, it is quieter than I suspected.‚Äù
Him:
‚ÄúWhoops sorry was on a run then showering just saw this! Maybe too late now but I hope you‚Äôre able to get out early!‚Äù
Me:
‚ÄúNo worries! Funny enough, I haven‚Äôt eaten yet üò≥ so I‚Äôm technically free if you are. Otherwise Paris rain check it is!‚Äù
Him:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bit tight for me, maybe let‚Äôs do when you get back!‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm overthinking it and feel like I came off a bit desperate or overeager by offering twice that I was free. From my perspective I was just trying to be flirty, open, and flexible with timing.
My question: If you were a guy on the receiving end, would you read this as desperate, or just as interest/availability? And for the future, should I just say it once and then leave the ball in his court?
Thanks in advance üôè",1,1759373401.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I decided to try and adjust the grind on a 30 year old Rocky grinder that had never been cleaned since new and found that no matter how hard I tried to rotate the hopper it wouldn't move. I unscrewed and removed the hopper and found a disgusting mess which was to be expected after all that time but no matter how much cleaning I did, I still can't unscrew the grind adjustment. I suspect this is just because of the years of sticky coffee oil build up. Does anyone have any ideas of how I could free it up?",1,1759373325.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1nvs8yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ParkingHeron8051/comments/1nvs8yh/mx_master_4_review_logitech_did_it_again_kinda/,MX Master 4 Review ‚Äì Logitech did it again‚Ä¶ kinda,"Alright y‚Äôall, so I finally got my hands on the MX Master 4. If you‚Äôre already a fan of Logitech‚Äôs mice (guilty üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), you‚Äôll be happy to know this thing is another solid entry. It‚Äôs basically what you‚Äôd expect: premium, feature-packed, and makes you feel like your workflow is on steroids.¬†If you‚Äôre already a fan, you‚Äôre gonna feel right at home ‚Äî and if you‚Äôve been stuck on an older model, this is the jump you‚Äôve been waiting for.  


But here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not some mind-blowing leap from the 3S. Think of it like upgrading from an iPhone 16 to a 17: yeah, you‚Äôll notice some tweaks, but at the end of the day you‚Äôre still texting your mom and doomscrolling on TikTok the same way.



üëâ¬†**Who should upgrade?**



* If you‚Äôre on the MX Master 1 or 2 ‚Üí do it. Massive upgrade. You‚Äôll be like, ‚Äúwhere has this been my whole life?‚Äù

* On the 3S? You‚Äôre fine to stick with it, but the 4 has enough new tricks that, honestly, you might start looking for excuses to buy it. It‚Äôs that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt¬†*need*¬†it, but damn I want it‚Äù vibe.







üëâ¬†**Stuff I love:**



* The new gesture actions feel slick once you get used to them.
* It looks really good sitting on the desk ‚Äî Logitech always nails the aesthetics.
* Haptic feedback = chef‚Äôs kiss.
* Side scroll wheel is smoother, feels more natural when you‚Äôre actually using it.
* Clicks are a bit quieter (your coworkers or roommates will thank you).
* Extra side button‚Ä¶ not game-changing, but it does make the mouse feel more ‚Äúmulti-tool‚Äù than the 3S.



üëâ¬†**Stuff that bugs me:**



* Comfort. The 3S just molded to my hand better. With the 4, I catch myself constantly adjusting grip like I‚Äôm trying to get comfy in bed but can‚Äôt find the right pillow spot.
* The new material feels nice but also more slippery. Less ‚Äúglued to my hand,‚Äù more ‚Äúoops almost dropped it reaching for my coffee.‚Äù
* Shape tweaks make it feel a little less friendly for smaller/average hands. The 3S felt like it adapted to you. The 4 feels like you‚Äôre adapting to¬†*it*.

**Bottom line:**¬†This mouse is a¬†*workflow weapon*. If you‚Äôre on an older MX Master, don‚Äôt think twice ‚Äî this is your upgrade. If you‚Äôre on the 3S, it‚Äôs not a must-have, but it‚Äôs tempting enough that you might talk yourself into it (and you won‚Äôt regret it once you do). Logitech didn‚Äôt reinvent the wheel, but they definitely made it spin smoother.",1,1759373121.0,u_ParkingHeron8051,0,0.99,False

i used to snack all day without even thinking like chips here some cookies there juice every hour and i always felt tired bloated and heavy no matter what i did i even tried going to the gym and running like a maniac, but the weight just stayed the same or came back quick then one day i just stopped everything with sugar in it no more biscuits no more soda, even stopped adding sugar to tea and switched to water and coffee only started eating more eggs bananas boiled stuff and just keeping meals super basic and bro the fat started falling off,

I didn't expect it but in 2 weeks I looked leaner, my abs were more visible, my face got sharper and I wasn't walking around feeling stuffed all the time and the weird thing is once you stop sugar the cravings actually disappear fast, like day 3 I didn't even want anything sweet anymore my energy went up too, and I didn't even touch the gym for those 2 weeks it was just walking, and clean eating, not perfect eating just clean and simple honestly,

1nvs1ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nvs1ld/failing_in_my_marriage/,Failing in my marriage,"I (41M) have been married for 11 years to my wife (37F).  We have two kids, 11 and 9.  On the serface our lives seem pretty great.  Underneath I‚Äôm frustrated, resentful and confused.

My wife and I met working for the same company.  We only dated for a few months before she got pregnant with our first kid.  We decided to move in together and bought a house with help from my parents.  Six months later I proposed and when our son was one we got married.  Looking back I ignored some red flags, but wanted a family and did my best to make it work.  We grew up in very different families.  My parents are loving supportive and generous.  Her mom has a huge heart but her dad was verbally abusive to my wife growing up and is still mean to his wife in front of us and our kids. Both sets of parents are involved in our kids lives.

For the first 6-7 years I did all our finances.  I wasn‚Äôt the best but I made sure we had everything we needed.  Bills got paid on time for the most part and I tried to communicate openly about what we could afford and not afford.  About 4 years ago I missed a couple mortgage payments and started falling behind on our finances.  I tried to fix it quietly but when my wife got a call from the mortgage company asking for a payment she was understandably livid.  She involved her employers, my parents, family friends and pastors.  I thought our marriage was ending but she took over all our finances and bank accounts and we worked through it.  For the first couple years she was amazing.  Allocating every dollar and sharing a weekly spread sheet.  I borrowed money.  We got caught up and paid everything off.  Now fast forward to today we are in the worst place financially we‚Äôve ever been in.  We have a joint account that both our paychecks get deposited into.  I make about 75% of our monthly income.  Once each check hits she transfers out money for bills and mortgage into accounts I‚Äôm not on and don‚Äôt have access to.  Lately money has been going out but nothing is getting paid.  We‚Äôre behind on everything and she‚Äôs used up all of our reserves.  When I bring it up she says she‚Äôs getting us caught up and it will just take another month or two but it‚Äôs been about 4 months and it‚Äôs not getting better.  If I press harder she gets angry and defensive and reminds me of how I screwed up when I did the finances.  We talk about sitting down and looking at everything together but then she gets busy or tired or doesn‚Äôt feel good and it never happens.

The other issue is that I have a much stronger libido than she does.  Mostly she treats sex like a chore.  She doesn‚Äôt initiate and rejects me 8 out of 10 times.  I am very attracted to her physically but don‚Äôt enjoy sex when I feel undesired and have to beg.  About 2 years ago she bought a vibrator and hid it from me for months, then one day she told me about it and asked if I wanted to use it on her.  I was very excited and jumped right in.  She didn‚Äôt enjoy it and said it was awkward.  I asked how I could make it more enjoyable and she didn‚Äôt have an answer.  We only tried it together twice.  For a few months after that I would see it move around from our bathroom to the closet to her nightstand or under her side of the bed when I wasn‚Äôt home.  All while not having any interest in sex with me.  It really started to mess with my confidence and I brought it up a couple times.  She never wanted to talk about it and would put the issue back on me saying.  I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way, or that me feeling like I didn‚Äôt satisfy her was all in my head.  The last time I brought it up I said I feel like she‚Äôs not attracted to me and it hurts my feelings to be rejected sexually and then see she‚Äôs using a vibrator.  She got pissed! We didn‚Äôt talk for a long time and then she text saying I was being unfair and she‚Äôll just throw it away.  I explained she didn‚Äôt need to and I‚Äôm fine with her owning it and using it, I just want to also experience intimacy with her.  Later on I apologized for being it up and she excepted.  I never saw it again and assumed she threw it away.  About a month ago I saw it in a box in our closet and noticed when I‚Äôm not home and she is it moves around.  Again I don‚Äôt mind if she uses it I just don‚Äôt understand why we aren‚Äôt having sex.  She has also said that masturbation is not cheating for women but it is for men.

We‚Äôve done marriage counseling off and on but she mostly seems to want to fix me and not own any part of these issues.  I see a psychiatrist and psychologist on my own, but I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs helping.  She is too overwhelmed to see a psychologist on her own although she says she needs to. Our last marriage counselor said she should and I feel she needs to as well.

I wake up first, make her coffee and wake her up.  While she gets ready for work I get the kids up and get them ready for school.  I make my wife a coffee to go, a protein smoothy and lunch and then she leaves.  Then I take the kids to school and go to work.  I pick the kids up from school because I work from home in the afternoons.  I help them with homework take them to extra curricular activities and then my wife gets home.  She usually sits on the couch and reads or scrolls on her phone while I make dinner.  We eat in front of the tv.  I‚Äôve tried doing family dinners around the table several times but we always revert back to the couch and tv.  And then I clean up the kitchen while she gets ready for bed and I or we put the kids down.

My wife is not all bad.  She cleans on the weekends and always makes sure our kids have what they need.  Clothes, shoes, school supplies.  I‚Äôm not perfect either.  I can be moody, grumpy, overly emotional at times.

I just don‚Äôt know if I can keep doing this.  I feel I‚Äôm losing myself and I don‚Äôt like who I am anymore.  If I try to talk to her she says she‚Äôs the worst and a terrible wife and then I feel guilty for bringing it up.  If I don‚Äôt say anything she seems happy but I‚Äôm not.  She‚Äôs told me in so many words if I ever left her she would destroy me.  Custody, alimony, child support, all of it.  I can‚Äôt imagine losing my kids or her for that matter.  If I stay my kids have a better chance of success and she‚Äôs happy, but I‚Äôm not.  If I leave I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd be any happier and all their lives would be worse.  I don‚Äôt want to separate or leave.  I do love my wife and want to grow old with her.  I see moments of greatness in her.  But most of the time she seems uninterested in me except to want to improve me.  I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

1nvs0eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1nvs0eo/italian_mountains_and_lakes_a_trip_report_of_sorts/,Italian Mountains and Lakes - A Trip Report of Sorts,"Ciao!

Recently completed a trip with a theme of 'Mountains and Lakes': 4 nights in Switzerland and 8 nights in Italy.  As this is ItalyTravel, I'll mostly talk here of the Italian portion.  Trip was from early to mid September 2025 with a group of a 4 people (two couples).  Flew into/out from Zurich and rented a car for a large loop around the alps.

Myself and my wife are very experienced Italian travelers (2+ years combined in the country, 17 of 20 regions visited in depth), however this was the first time to Italy for our friends.  This was purely meant as a hiking trip with a short diversion to wine country and the agenda performed spectacularly with the help of near-perfect weather.

**Verona and Valpolicella** \- 3 Nights

After 3 nights in Murren, Switzerland, we drove to Veneto via the Grimsel Pass, Furka Pass, St. Gottard Pass, along Lake Como, and finally a lazy final few hours cruising the A4.  This drive could be 5-6 hours if you chose an efficient route, which we explicitly avoided in favor of the windiest, most scenic cuts possible.  With numerous scenic, snack, and coffee stops this was a full-day voyage of about 10 hours.

We stayed at Agriturismo Acinatico Wine Relais on the hill above Fumane.  Wonderful accommodations and friendly staff.   After the long driving day, we had two full days in this region: the first was spent visiting various wineries in Valpolicella while the second was focused on Verona.  We purposely avoided larger wineries that export to the US - some standout experiences were the tasting/tours at Zyme and Secondo Marco.

Our day in Verona was spent wandering and doing the standard Verona things: Arena, Castelvecchio, Piazza Erbe, Castel San Pietro, simply enjoying the old streets and random churches, etc. etc.

This is a foodie area so the standouts include:

* Trattoria Caprini in Torbe for fantastic homemade tagliatelle
* Gelato Crea Verona for excellent non-tourist trap Gelato
* Enoteca della Valpolicella for the best wine-focused coursed menu dinner of the trip
* L'Evanglista Ristorante in Verona for an unforgettable special occasion dinner

**Lake Garda / Malcesine -** 2 Nights

Packed up the car and drove about 2 hours (with some traffic along the lake) to Malcesine.  Our hotel for two nights was the Hotel Garni Ischia which turned out to be the perfect place for us.  Great view of the lake and castle from a private balcony, well-appointed but distinctly European-sized rooms, and most important for us -- a large surface parking area for our car.

We chose the smaller and more frequent Garda Express boat for a trip to Limone Sul Garda, which I would highly recommend as an afternoon destination from Malcesine.  We also benefited from near ideal weather for a half-day trip up to Monte Baldo where we took advantage of numerous hiking trails.

Malcesine is a picturesque and quintessentially Italian lakefront town where you'll want to see the Castello Scaligero but most important is to not overthink your time here:  just wander the narrow cobblestone alleys, pick your favorite spot for an afternoon spritz, and generally enjoy life.

Our food in Malcesine was intentionally casual and no frills -

* Pizzeria da Pedro for good pizza and a hilarious lakefront dining experience where each boat wake may drench half the diners in water.
* Rooftop 99 Bistrot for incredible ambience, views, and personalized service (better for drinks than the food).
* ""God Save the Gelato"" L'Artigiano dei Sapori - obviously best Gelato in Malcesine (and possibly Garda)

**Seiser Alm / Compatsch** \- 3 Nights

Easy two hour drive north from Malcesine to Compatsch, where we stayed at the Seiser Alm Urthaler hotel.  This hotel was easily accessible by car at the entrance to the high elevation meadow and had an underground carpark with space for larger vehicles.

This portion of the trip was solely spent enjoying the endless hiking adventures offered in Seiser Alm and the central location near the major lifts made this hotel a dream spot.  We had half board included in our room, so our food experiences on Seiser Alm were more focused on lunch breaks on a hike.

Some highlights include:

* Hiking the Hexenbanke loop and stopping for lunch at the Arnika Hutte.
* Hiking a loop up to Punta d'Oro with lunch/after hike beers at Gostner Schwaige
* Hiking a loop including lunch at Refugio Sasso Piatto (with reportedly the best burger of the trip)

After Seiser Alm, we took another long scenic driving day to return to our flight departure and rental car return point of Zurich.

**Key Takeaways -**

* Between the Swiss and Dolomite portions of this trip we experienced some of the best hikes of our lives.  Highly recommend both Murren and Seiser Alm.
* The valleys around Seiser Alm (Val Gardena, etc.) tend to be more popular for Americans, but staying on top of the meadow itself in Compatch/Compaccio is more suited for our laid back, outdoorsy style.
* Malcesina and Seiser Alm are both heavily trafficked by German tourists.  Can be a positive - just practice up on your German if you want to make friends with fellow travelers.
* Our rental car was a BMW 5-series Wagon, which was perfect for two adult couples with plentiful space on the long driving days, but this large class of car should only be driven in this region by an experienced driver -- and advanced scouting of larger parking spaces will be required.  If you don't know what you're doing, then rent a small car.
* This was the first trip to Italy for the couple traveling with us and I take no small amount of joy in fact they can say they've visited Italy and NOT seen Rome/Florence/Venice - hah.
* Valpolicella is an incredible wine region.  Don't get overly distracted by the more popular Tuscan and Piedmont wines.  This area is a must-visit for wine lovers.  (also a glass of local Lugana on the shores of Garda can be life altering).",1,1759372403.0,ItalyTravel,2,1.0,False

I met this Thai, just before Christmas 2 years ago. One of the few who could speak English. Let's call him Joe. Joe had a shop that he sold fried chicken from, but it wasn't a good business (so he said). But he was super friendly (probably too friendly) and the first day he offered to drive me back to my hotel. And said that I could just call the next day if I wanted to go down to the beach again. I didn't do that, because I love to walk. (something Thais don't understand)

A week into our friendship, after several trips back to the hotel on his motorbike. He told me that he had lost money selling chicken on the beach, if I could lend him 3000bath.  
At first I said no, because I have always had bad experiences with that!

But in my hotel room, I thought about it, and decided to lend him the money. After 3 weeks, he wanted to have a coffee with me, he had this idea! That he should have a bus and be a taxi driver. For all the tourists. And you can probably imagine who would invest in that bus.

But I just told him that it was a bad idea, and there were too many competitors. And our friendship ended because he could not pay the 3000bath back.",0,1759372179.0,ThailandTourism,6,0.33,False

It is a long one and maybe a bit chaotic, so sorry about that in advance. If there‚Äôs any spelling mistakes, also sorry about that.

For a little less than a year I(f) had been dating this person (m). From the start I liked him very much and he liked me as well. It felt like coming home. He came out of a relationship, still very fresh and after a few months of dating I asked where we both stood on us. I really liked him, starting to develop stronger feelings and with keeping his mourning of his ex still in mind I wanted to make sure we were on the same page. He told me he wasn‚Äôt ready at the moment to commit or do anything more than what we already did (dates, sleeping over and seeing each other exclusively) and I told him I did want to have a relationship with him, but could wait for him to mourn his past relationship and stay in this bubble for a while. This went on for almost a year. 

After almost a year and many fights about this subject I asked him again and he told me he wasn‚Äôt ready and couldn‚Äôt give me what I asked of him, a relationship. We were still dating. Nothing changed. I told him I thought it would be best for us to end things, because I was feeling more and more sad every day with the thought this situation would never change and I also didn‚Äôt want to keep pushing him in his process of moving on from his ex. He wouldn‚Äôt let me go but wouldn‚Äôt move forward so I broke it off. It hurt really bad and I didn‚Äôt want to do that at all, but he couldn‚Äôt give me what I wanted from him and I didn‚Äôt want to give him a hard time from moving on any further. So I broke it off. 

I was upset and feeling bad, because I was mourning a breakup from a relationship that wasn‚Äôt even one, even though everything we did and how we acted says otherwise. I went on a date with someone else, almost had intercourse with them and I just couldn‚Äôt. 

I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking I was doing something wrong and went home. The date was a mutual friend of me and another friend of mine and there were some social events where we would see each other again. We met up some times after that and just talked mostly because I felt pressured to do it because of the mutual friend. I didn‚Äôt want it to get awkward or uncomfortable between us so tried to be civil. 

Short after the date, he (the long dating guy) came back to me and asked if we could try again. That he missed me and made the mistake of letting me go, he really wanted to try for the relationship this time. I never told him about the ‚Äòfriend‚Äô, because for me it wasn‚Äôt anything more than friendship (even less than that) and it happend when we weren‚Äôt together. 

I never expected him to come back for me. I gave up all hope and thought never to hear form him again. But he did and I told him multiple times no because I was scared he would hurt me again. He would just leave me in the same spot of ‚Äòdating‚Äô again. Eventually I said I wanted to try but couldn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt do it again if it wouldn‚Äôt work out. No more chances.  Because it hurt a lot. The dating and me walking away form someone I wanted but couldn‚Äôt give me the same, hurt me. 

Now a few months later, the ‚Äòfriend‚Äô texted me about something and he (the long dating guy) saw it on my phone. He asked me about why a guy was texting me and I told him it was a mutual friend of me and someone else. He wanted to read the chat and I let him. I didn‚Äôt delete a big part of it so you can see we talked and also that we hung out to have coffee. 

I still talked to the friend when he said he wanted to try again, saw him a few times also in social gatherings with other friends. I did tell the friend multiple times I didn‚Äôt see him in any other way than just friends so he knew.  

But now the question: am I the asshole for going on a date with the friend and keeping in touch after my ‚Äòex‚Äô told me he wanted to try again? 

The only reason we still talked was because I didn‚Äôt want anything to get uncomfortable and didn‚Äôt really know what to do with the situation. 

But he found out and says I cheated on him, even though it happened because I thought I‚Äôd never see or speak to him ever again. The contact with the friend while we started talking and trying again, that had been wrong of me but I didn‚Äôt think more of him than just an acquaintance I went on a horrible date with once. 

I told him I‚Äôve always loved him but didn‚Äôt expect him back in my life, so out of sadness and anger and trying to move on I went on a date. He wants time to think about the fact if he wants to keep on trying with me. I want to respect his choice whatever he decides because I do see that my actions have been wrong, but I did tell him I can‚Äôt wait forever again. 

I chose myself when walking away from him and made those decisions with not knowing he would come back into my life. I don‚Äôt want to lose him again, but I can‚Äôt stand the thought of him never reaching out for me again and me just waiting for an answer if he wants to keep on trying. Eventually it is his choice and I will respect whatever he decides. 

I have no idea what to do.",1,1759372007.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

2. Boba brown sugar tea - 320, it was just average 

3. Curry puffs - 320, it was way worse than street side bakery.

4. Otak otak, 550 rupees - steamed fish, just airpods case size and 2 pieces. - nothing like it is a delicacy for this exorbitant price.

5. Ayam goreng beerampah - 520 rupees - this is a deep fried chicken with sprinkles of ginger on it!! This is so mediocre and didn‚Äôt understand the hype around it in google reviews and Instagram influencers

6. SIU MAI- 380 rupees - duck meat, 3 small dumplings of duck meat, this was tasteless. 

7. Nasi lemak - 780 rupees, this was the most hyped and worst thing of all of them!! 

8. Kopi Tiramisu- 480 rupees- this is their signature dish and every one in the reviews are praising this.. astonishingly, this is just a coffee pastry served with whip cream and coffee froth.. tiramisu would come with mascarpone cheese !!

Now what went wrong???

1. Tables were of tiny kids study table size and they made 3 people to sit around it!!

2. All starters were served at same time on that table, we didn‚Äôt had any place to keep plates or cutlery..

3. It was difficult to manage anything and serving plates were like dessert plates size, we had to eat, manage.

4. Despite of calling the staff they rarely came and cleaned the tables or replaced the plates!!

5. Finally the main course came and we ran out of place on table, didn‚Äôt know where to keep it.

6. Staff didn‚Äôt even refill water!!


I paid like 4000 rupees for their disaster service and mediocre food!! 

I would have enjoyed the food, if the table space was more accommodative and staff were attentive!!

Please do not visit this restaurant for dinner!!

I've been a home barista for about 7 years now, and I recently noticed something that's been bugging me about my espresso machine. It seems to take forever to heat up in the morning, and I know many of you probably face the same issue. So, I did some deep diving to figure out what's going on.

First off, it's totally normal for an espresso machine to take anywhere from 15-45 minutes to properly heat up. I know, it sounds crazy, but there's actually a good reason for this. These machines need to reach the perfect temperature (around 200¬∞F) to extract the best flavor from your coffee beans.

The main factor affecting heat-up time is the boiler type. Single boiler machines (like the ones I started with) generally heat up faster but can struggle with temperature consistency. Double boiler machines, while taking longer to heat up, provide much better temperature stability and are great for making multiple drinks.

I learned this the hard way - trying to rush the process usually results in bitter or sour espresso. Trust me, I've made that mistake more times than I'd like to admit!

If you're tired of waiting around in the morning, I've found some excellent machines that heat up much faster. After tons of research and testing, I discovered some great options at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. They've got some solid choices that won't break the bank.

Here are some tips I've learned to speed up the process:
- Keep your machine in a warm room
- Don't store it in a cold garage or basement
- Use a smart plug to turn it on before you wake up
- Regular descaling helps maintain heating efficiency
- Leave the portafilter in while heating (it needs to be hot too!)

The quality of your machine makes a huge difference too. Higher-end models usually have better heating elements and more efficient systems. If you're in the market for an upgrade, check out these reliable options at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine - they've got everything from entry-level to pro machines.

Last month, I switched to a machine with a PID controller, which has made a massive difference in both heat-up time and temperature stability. It's like night and day compared to my old machine!

Remember, while waiting for your machine to heat up might be annoying, it's a crucial step in making great espresso. You can't rush perfection, but you can definitely make the process more efficient with the right equipment and setup.

Let me know if you have any questions about specific machines or heating issues - I'd love to help out fellow coffee enthusiasts!",1,1759371478.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nvrimh,https://www.reddit.com/r/kennesaw/comments/1nvrimh/stuff_happening_this_weekend_first_weekend_of/,Stuff Happening this Weekend (First weekend of October),"To start things off we have a Consignment Sale for Children's clothing, maternity clothes, shoes, toys, nursery items, baby equipment, furniture and what not on Friday (October 3rd) from 9 AM to 7 PM and on Saturday (October 4th) from 9 AM to Noon. It's at Marietta First Church of the Nazarene‚Äã over on Dallas Highway in Marietta. Event and parking at the event are free.

On Friday (October 3rd) we have the final First Friday Concert of the year at the Plaza next to the 1885 and across from the Revival on Main apartments. The band is G Clef and the Playlist, the set often includes Prince, Earth, Wind & Fire, Hall & Oates, and Metallica. The event is free and kicks off at 7 PM, ending around 9 PM. This one is put on by the downtown merchants so they want you buying food and drink on Main Street rather than spending time at the amphitheater.

IF you didn't get enough of 5Ks last week, Marietta has a Make a Wish branded one on Saturday (October 4th) from 8 AM to 10 AM. It starts and ends on the Marietta Square, so stay outside the 120 Loop if you don't have business there. The Marietta Farmer's Market is going on as per normal opening at 9 AM to Noon just across the railroad tracks from the Square, and the event organizers recommend that you stop by the Farmer's Market for a ""cool down snack"". The sign up link is [here](https://runsignup.com/Race/GA/Marietta/CobbCounty5KMakeAWish). 

On Saturday (October 4th) it's a Cemetery Clean Up day from 9 AM to Noon at the city cemetery. Come help out and help History Kid clean up the graveyard for the spooky season.

If running or cleaning aren't your speed Cobb County has decided to have their Touch-A-Truck even on Saturday (October 4th) starting at 10 AM and running to 3 PM. The trucks you can touch include but are not limited to: a police car, dump truck, SWAT truck, fire truck, fire engine, assorted county owned construction vehicles, and a Georgia National Guard vehicle of unspecified type. They are charging for it this time, $5 per person or $20 per family whichever is cheaper. They're fundraising for the Cobb County Safety Village.

Later on that Saturday (October 4th) is the final major concert of the season at the amphitheater. Its Who‚Äôs Bad: The Ultimate Michael Jackson Tribute Band, rescheduled from being rained out in June. Admission is free, though you can optionally pay for VIP. Event kicks off at 7 PM and runs to 10 PM.

DO NOT BE AFRAID, on Sunday (October 5th) the people lining the  ramps on the Interstate are not protesting, they are simply there for the monthly Coffee and Octane car meet. They want to see the rare/fancy cars show off as they arrive and leave. The meet is actually at Town Center Mall just outside the food court from 9 AM to Noon. Event is free to visitors but if you want to show off your car it's $15.

ALSO DON'T BE AFEARED, the scarecrows along Kennesaw Main Street are already up. They'll be up all month. Do be careful and drive slow, there might be kids or dogs behind the displays. Do take the time to stroll the street and give them a good look, though.

No KSU football this week, but next Thursday (October 9th) they have a Thursday Night Prime Time home game against Louisiana Tech, so expect the area between Barrett and Chastain to be an absolute headache.",3,1759370997.0,kennesaw,0,1.0,False

after a really bad break up 2 years ago ive gained about 20-25 lbs. before the breakup I alrdy had gained about 5 lbs, and the rest packed on pretty quick.

I think part of it was just not caring what I ate, being less active. I was also breastfeeding still at night before I gained this weight, and following breastfeeding stopping, I  that think contributed to the weight gain also. my body was used to eating more, even when I stopped, I was still eating the same as I was when breastfeeding  but was burning less cals.

I feel like its rly hard for me to eat less food, a lot ofmy calories come from coffee, which I put in a lot of cream /sugars, to the point I prob have 500-600 cals just in coffee a day, and I feel like maybe  I should try to stop drinking it altogether, it has a bad control on me and I crave it constantly and waste tons of money 0n it that I feel like my life would be better if I could just stop drinking it. 

on top of that, I have young kids so I often have junk/snacks in my house, or food im giving them, that causes me to eat what I otherwise wouldnt if I lived alone. 

I have been much more active and exercise a lot, but it hasn't made me lose weight. through all thistitme no matter how much ive tried to lose weight I cant lose a lb, the only thing ivebene able to do is stop gaining weight. I think itsbc I need to limit my cals more but I eat more Thani should from stress/the snacks in my house/coffee. I really want this weight off and I need motivation and tips to help me eat less/maybe stop drinking coffee even tho its kinda my support rn, I feel like ifs gave it up I might have more control. I feel like I usually eat anywhere from 1700-2300 cals, usually prob around 1900. 

one thing is when I do try to diet, sometimes I get shaky/fainty so I end up eating to feel better, that never used to happen to me and I have never weighed this much, before kids I was tiny, and even after I was small, this is weight gain that happened after the breaku0p & ive never weighed this much before outside of being pregnant.

You know what that tells me? That you actually don't give a damn about your kids or anyone's birthday for that matter, that you only like the praise of throwing them a party but not them at all. 

Also you rage baited the SHIT out of your husband with that coffee stunt. So you asked for his 1st cup and he said yes then got mad because it wasn't how you wanted it. Then instead of making your own at first, you got MAD at him for making himself another one that was hot because he wouldn't give it to you. Then you had the audacity to get upset with him, gaslight him and be like ""fine I'll make my own"" when he got upset you wouldn't stop. On top of that you made him apologize for yelling but I bet you didn't care to apologize for bating him in the first place though did you? Now don't get it twisted though, he had no right and no man has any right to yell or scream just because they are mad but you also don't get to push push push and then cry wolf either. You seem to be good at that though.

Verdict first: actually works, just depends if convenience is worth the premium to you. Started seeing results week 3. noticeable improvement by month 2. Teeth legitimately whiter now.

Here's the math though. Larineco runs $28/month so (84$ for 3 months). Professional whitening is $650 upfront plus $200/year for touch-ups. boka toothpaste with same ingredient costs $11/month but takes longer.

Ngl, texture is weird first two weeks. Not gonna sugarcoat it. But reality check is that hydroxyapatite (the active ingredient) is legit with tons of studies backing it. but you can get it way cheaper in toothpaste form. you're basically paying extra for convenience of post coffee gum instead of brushing.

If you have chaotic coffee schedule and disposable income, worth it. if you want dramatic fast results just get professional whitening. on a budget? get boka toothpaste, same ingredient for a third of the price.

Keeping my subscription because I'm lazy and it works. but if someone made a $10 version tomorrow I'd switch instantly.

Female 31 10 weeks post partum. I‚Äôve read so many stories on here and I genuinely feel better doing so. I just started therapy & downloaded the dare app. I‚Äôve worked in mental health in a treatment center for teens and know so many tools, coping mechanisms and attended therapy with the students‚Ä¶yet‚Ä¶I still cannot help myself. (Haven‚Äôt worked there in years and have a very stress free job now) Panic disorder hit me like a ton of bricks out of nowhere. It‚Äôs extremely physical. I dealt with it about a yr before pregnancy and now after birth it‚Äôs back with a vengeance. It seems so impossible that my crushing chest pain, all day long arm numbness, back pain, dizziness, blips in memory, globus sensations are all‚Ä¶anxiety? I don‚Äôt have the type of anxiety that‚Äôs constantly worrying or obsessing over worst case scenarios. I live my life normally and go out, do things, talk to people, work etc it‚Äôs the physical sensations that put me in a spiral. Is anyone else‚Äôs like this? You will be laughing and going about your day then BAM your whole chest is on fire, then your arms then here comes the tightness and pain and then it lasts half the day telling your mind it HAS to be serious. Has to be a post partum heart attack, and too much stress. I can‚Äôt even sip coffee anymore because the rush will last dang near all day and feels like histamine is going to blow my body up. What‚Äôs gives :( I cannot do an SSRI, I‚Äôm extremely sensitive and have tried many. I was a frequent flyer in the ER so all the tests have been done. If there are any tips or solace that would be nice :) ",3,1759370324.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False
1nvr8lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1nvr8lg/my_kidnapper_couldnt_feel_pain/,My Kidnapper Couldn‚Äôt Feel Pain,"I woke to a smell that shouldn‚Äôt have existed anywhere outside a morgue ‚Äî bleach cut with rust and something sour-metallic like coins held in the mouth. My head throbbed; my eyes refused to open at first. The dark was so complete it felt like fabric pressed to my face. When I tried to move, pain shot through my shoulders and up my neck. My arms were suspended above me.

The bindings were layers of torn cloth cinched tight with plastic zip ties. My hands had gone cold and pale, fingers tingling, almost blue. Each time I tried to shift, a new line of pain flared ‚Äî burning, stabbing, tearing ‚Äî radiating out from my joints like cracking glass.

Somewhere, a sound began: a low humming, tuneless, at first far away, then circling me. My heart slammed against my ribs. I tasted bile in the back of my throat.
The humming stopped. Footsteps scraped concrete. A metallic click. A single fluorescent bulb stuttered to life above me, casting a greenish glare across cinder block walls.

The walls were wrapped floor to ceiling in butcher paper. Anatomical diagrams scrawled in black ink covered every surface ‚Äî nervous systems, muscle groups, hospital pain scales with handwritten notations in the margins. Words like nociception, analgesia, stimulus written and underlined. In places the ink had bled, streaked downward like someone had pressed their face to it and wept.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake,‚Äù a voice said.

They stepped into the light. At first they looked like a tired grad student: thin frame, pale skin, dark hair hanging in their eyes. But their arms told a different story ‚Äî a network of pale scars crosshatched from wrist to elbow, stitched with surgical neatness. A missing fingertip sealed in shiny tissue. They wore a dark apron stiff with old stains.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad,‚Äù they said softly. ‚ÄúYou can help me understand.‚Äù

My mouth opened but only a hoarse rasp emerged. ‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ who are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey called me lucky. Congenital analgesia. No pain. But pain is how you know you‚Äôre alive.‚Äù

They raised a hand. A hypodermic needle pierced the fleshy web between thumb and forefinger. No blood. The wound had been cauterized. They twisted the steel shaft as if tuning an instrument. ‚ÄúThis should hurt,‚Äù they whispered. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs only pressure. Tell me ‚Äî what would this feel like to you?‚Äù

I stared at the hole in their hand, nausea rising like acid. ‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ burning glass,‚Äù I croaked. ‚ÄúGlass under the skin.‚Äù
Their pupils dilated. ‚ÄúBurning glass,‚Äù they repeated. ‚ÄúBetter than textbooks.‚Äù

They lowered me from the ceiling and bolted me into a wooden chair stained dark. My ankles were duct-taped to the legs; my wrists bound behind me. They draped a blanket across my shoulders ‚Äî smelling of rust and bleach ‚Äî like a caretaker preparing a patient.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll stay warmer this way,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúShivering corrupts the data.‚Äù

A clipboard appeared with fifty blank lines under Pain Vocabulary.

They began on themselves: hands plunged into ice water until their skin blued, then blasted with a blow dryer until flesh pinked, then blanched. Each time they asked me to describe it, my voice trembling.

‚ÄúNeedles under the skin,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGlass splinters. Heat like peeling sunburn alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeel you,‚Äù they murmured, writing it down.

Then it was my turn. A rubber band snapping against my forearm, a pinch of tweezers to the thin skin between thumb and index. Even minor acts were magnified by terror, the stench, the inevitability of escalation.

By night (if it was night ‚Äî the light never changed), my arms and hands trembled uncontrollably. My lips cracked from dryness. Tears streaked salt across my face. I pictured my apartment, my cat, the smell of coffee at dawn ‚Äî normal life turning alien and unreachable.

On the second day, their fascination intensified. A small hammer, a steel plate, and a scalpel lay waiting on a tray.

They placed their own left hand flat on the plate, raised the hammer, and brought it down. A sound like a branch snapping. Their index finger bent at an unnatural angle. They didn‚Äôt blink.

‚ÄúWhat would it feel like?‚Äù they hissed, eyes shining.
I gagged, bile rising. ‚ÄúEvery nerve screaming‚Ä¶ lightning inside‚Ä¶ something wrong, ripped apart.‚Äù

They closed their eyes, whispering: ‚ÄúWronged. Yes. That‚Äôs the one.‚Äù

Then came me. Rubber bands became clamps, tweezers became pinpricks of sharp metal. Every touch magnified by dread. My skin crawled. My nerves lit up like live wires.

I began crying without sound, tears running down my cheeks, soaking the blanket. My hands went numb. I tried to think of my name, my address, anything to anchor myself ‚Äî but the basement smell dragged me back: bleach, rust, cooked meat.

Hallucinations began at the edges: whispers in corners, my own reflection in puddles where none existed, the sense of someone standing behind me even when I knew we were alone.

On the third day, they introduced electricity.
A car battery appeared on a metal cart, wires dangling from crude clips. Sparks popped when they tested the connection, filling the basement with the scent of ozone. Their broken finger was splinted, stained brown at the tips.

They sketched diagrams of the experiment on the wall with chalk, neat as blueprints. ‚ÄúThis will be the one,‚Äù they whispered. ‚ÄúThis will let me feel.‚Äù

First they shocked themselves. Sparks danced along pale flesh. Muscles twitched, lips parted, but they barely blinked.

Then they turned to me.
The wires bit into my forearms like insect mandibles. My muscles seized violently, my heart slamming so hard I thought it would rupture. The smell of ozone and burning cloth made me gag.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúTell me what it feels like.‚Äù

‚ÄúFire,‚Äù I gasped. ‚ÄúFire in my veins. Needles full of fire.‚Äù

They closed their eyes. ‚ÄúFire in the veins. Yes‚Ä¶‚Äù

It was then I realized they weren‚Äôt immune to fear ‚Äî only to pain. Their hand trembled over the switch. Their breathing came fast. A flicker of uncertainty crossed their eyes as I began whispering.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing it wrong,‚Äù I rasped. ‚ÄúPain isn‚Äôt just sensation ‚Äî it‚Äôs fear, helplessness, losing control. You have to let go.‚Äù

They tilted their head. ‚ÄúFear. Losing control.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I whispered, throat raw. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the key.‚Äù
By the end of the third day, my reality had thinned to a filament.

My skin was a map of bruises and pinpricks.
My muscles trembled uncontrollably.
My mind slipped in and out of hallucination.
Memories of sunlight and human voices seemed like a book I‚Äôd read long ago.

But a seed had taken root: the understanding that fear was their weakness, and my only way out.

When I came to again, there was no sense of day or night ‚Äî just the single green bulb above me and a hollow ache through my arms and legs. My wrists were raw; the skin beneath the duct tape had turned angry red. My teeth chattered before I realized they‚Äôd placed a metal basin in front of me.

‚ÄúIce first,‚Äù they murmured. Their voice was thin from sleeplessness but eager.

They seized my hands, wrists clamped like a vise, and plunged them into the basin. The water was so cold it felt sharp. My fingers went bone-white, then blue. Pain raced up my arms in jagged streaks, each nerve shattering into splinters. My throat convulsed. I couldn‚Äôt tell if the sound coming out of me was a sob or a laugh.
‚ÄúDescribe,‚Äù they ordered, eyes on me as if I were the only object in the room.

‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ a hundred knives in the marrow‚Ä¶ like my bones are glass and someone‚Äôs rattling them,‚Äù I whispered.
They nodded, scribbling notes. Then, without warning, they drew my hands out and pressed warm cloths doused with some chemical that burned as it thawed my skin. The agony multiplied. My flesh felt as if it were peeling, nerve endings sparking like loose wires.

I thought of mornings in my apartment: sunlight cutting across a wooden floor, my cat blinking at me from the couch. It made me dizzy with grief. I had to swallow back a scream that wasn‚Äôt about the pain but the memory of normalcy.

‚ÄúShivering corrupts data,‚Äù they murmured again, almost fondly, and wrapped my shoulders in the damp blanket.

They rolled in the battery again. This time the wires were tipped with small clamps instead of crude paddles. Sparks popped when the clips met. Ozone stung my throat, metallic and acrid.

They clamped the wires to their own forearm first. The muscle jumped, the skin quivered, but they only breathed harder, eyes wide as though at the edge of revelation.

Then they turned to me.

When the current hit, my body went rigid. My jaw locked. My heart banged like a fist against my ribs. A taste like pennies filled my mouth. For a moment I thought my vision had shattered into glass shards.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù they whispered. ‚ÄúTell me what it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fire inside a cage,‚Äù I rasped. ‚ÄúLike metal claws dragging through me. Like‚Ä¶ like my blood turned to bees.‚Äù

They shuddered with a kind of hunger. ‚ÄúBlood turned to bees,‚Äù they repeated, writing furiously.

Something cracked inside me then. Between the burning of my skin and the trembling of my heart, I realized they were trembling too ‚Äî not from pain but from anticipation, from their own strange excitement. And I began to see the thin seam of weakness: fear.

I woke to find a steel contraption standing in the center of the basement. It looked like a chair and a trap had been fused together: clamps for wrists and ankles, a collar brace, and a frame of steel rods.

‚ÄúI built this for me,‚Äù they said quietly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll help me use it.‚Äù
My own terror rose up like bile. But some small hard core inside me whispered, This is your chance.

‚ÄúIf you want it to work,‚Äù I murmured, making my voice tremble but also low, hypnotic, ‚Äúyou have to let me set it up. You can‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming or it won‚Äôt work.‚Äù
They hesitated, then nodded.

I tightened the straps across their arms, their legs, their chest. Every buckle was a drumbeat in my ears. They shuddered as control slipped from their hands. Their breath came quick, pupils dilated.

‚ÄúYou have to believe you can‚Äôt escape,‚Äù I whispered near their ear.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù they breathed. ‚ÄúYes. Show me.‚Äù

I clipped the battery wires to the metal pads at the armrests. Their muscles twitched under the clamps. A guttural sound escaped them ‚Äî not pain but the first hint of genuine panic.

I could almost feel their terror radiating off them, electric, contagious. My own chest ached with adrenaline. I memorized their breathing, their expression. This is how they‚Äôll break.

The next day they tried a different approach. No implements. No lights except a low, pulsing glow from a bulb strung somewhere behind me. They left me alone for what felt like hours.

Dripping pipes became a heartbeat. Shadows in the corners flexed and turned toward me like living things. I began to hear faint footsteps that weren‚Äôt there, a low voice humming words I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. My own voice whispered back without my consent.

I pressed my forehead against my knees and tried to remember the layout of my apartment, the taste of oranges, the texture of my cat‚Äôs fur. Each memory warped as soon as I called it up, turning into something grotesque.

When they returned, they stood silently, head tilted, studying me as if my hallucinations were as important as my flesh.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre breaking,‚Äù they said softly. ‚ÄúFear amplifies everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I murmured hoarsely, realizing I could weaponize that truth.

By the eighth day, my sense of time had shredded. I measured it only by the sound of the pipes and the tremors of my own heart.

They brought back the ice water, the clamps, the battery, combining everything in rapid succession: cold so deep it burned, then heat, then electric shocks. My body reacted before my mind could; spasms, tears, animal sounds I barely recognized as mine.

But beneath the horror, I was learning. Learning their patterns. Learning how their breath changed when they were afraid. Learning how to speak in the tone that made them hesitate.

And a strange clarity came with that learning ‚Äî a knowledge that if I could hold on a little longer, I could turn their hunger for understanding into their undoing.

When I woke, the green bulb flickered erratically, throwing knife-thin shadows across the cinder blocks. My throat felt sandpaper-raw from screaming the day before. On the floor near me lay a spiral notebook open to a fresh page. Their handwriting crawled across it, neat but frantic, filled with diagrams and phrases:
‚ÄúPAIN = LIFE‚Äù
 ‚ÄúFIND THE EDGE‚Äù
 ‚ÄúSHE KNOWS MORE‚Äù

For a long time I stared at the words until they seemed to crawl like insects. The last line was underlined three times. She knows more. My stomach lurched ‚Äî they had begun to believe in me as a kind of oracle.

They entered with a tray of syringes, their eyes bloodshot. ‚ÄúTell me about hunger,‚Äù they murmured. ‚ÄúTell me about deprivation.‚Äù

They had not eaten either. Their hands shook. They placed the syringes down, then held one up, examining the needle‚Äôs shine. I realized in a rush: their obsession was hollowing them out. If I could deepen their dependence on my words, I could pry the cracks wider.

I whispered: ‚ÄúIf you want to understand deprivation‚Ä¶you have to give up something. Something you need.‚Äù

They hesitated, breath trembling. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúSleep,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúClose your eyes in the chair. I‚Äôll record everything.‚Äù

They stared at me a long time, then at the syringes, then at the chair. Slowly, almost reverently, they sat.

I strapped them in again. The steel frame clanged faintly with each buckle. My fingers shook, but I masked it with clinical efficiency. They closed their eyes, trusting me. A tremor of triumph passed through me like static.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll feel nothing,‚Äù they whispered.

‚ÄúYou want to learn something,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThat means letting go.‚Äù

I clipped sensors to their skin ‚Äî thin wires, a heart monitor I‚Äôd fashioned from scraps, anything to look real. Then, as they drifted in the edge of sleep, I whispered small things: ‚ÄúYour hands are heavy. Your breath slows. You are weaker than you think.‚Äù

They twitched. Their eyes flickered beneath lids.
I did not harm them yet. I only left them strapped, alone, as I backed away to a far corner. In that corner, hidden beneath a crate, I‚Äôd found a rusted screwdriver days before. I palmed it now, feeling the weight, the point. For the first time, the tool was in my hand.

They woke groggy. The green bulb had burned out sometime in the night, plunging everything into a dense amber glow from a backup lamp. Their voice was thin: ‚ÄúWhat did you see?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre closer to the edge now.‚Äù

I handed them a cracked mirror I‚Äôd scavenged. ‚ÄúLook at yourself.‚Äù

They stared. Their pupils dilated, skin pale and damp with sweat. For the first time, I saw something like shame flicker across their features. They looked as if they‚Äôd aged ten years overnight.

‚ÄúYou need me,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt understand pain alone. You‚Äôll destroy yourself before you find it.‚Äù
They clutched the mirror. It slipped and cut their palm. Blood welled up, dark and slow. They stared at it, fascinated and horrified at once. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶can‚Äôt feel it,‚Äù they murmured.

I leaned close: ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre bleeding. That‚Äôs the truth your nerves can‚Äôt hide.‚Äù

They shuddered. A tremor ran through their whole body. They were starting to doubt their invincibility ‚Äî the one thing keeping them upright.

Food came less and less. Their hands shook when they tried to pour water. Their speech frayed, full of unfinished sentences. They had begun to smell sour, like someone fevered.

They still performed small torments ‚Äî ice water, clamps ‚Äî but they were half-hearted now, distracted. Each time they struck, their eyes darted to me as if asking permission.

That day I didn‚Äôt scream. I stared straight through them, whispering descriptions without being prompted: ‚ÄúHot needles under my skin. Glass storm. Nerves screaming.‚Äù It unnerved them more than any cry.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not afraid,‚Äù they muttered
.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm past fear,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not.‚Äù

Their hands trembled so badly the clamp slipped and snapped against their own thumb. They hissed, startled, as if the absence of pain now frightened them more than the idea of pain itself.

They slept strapped in the chair that night. I had done the straps so tight their hands tinged purple. While they snored shallowly, I crept around the basement, mapping every corner, every bolt. I found the fuse box, the breaker, the small window high on the wall crusted with grime.

I tested the screwdriver against the window frame. Metal squealed softly but didn‚Äôt break. Yet. I knew with time I could pry it loose.

I also knew time was running out. They were spiraling fast, and a spiraling captor could still kill me by accident. I would have to break free during one of their experiments, when their hands were full.

I returned to them and whispered at their ear, not loud enough to wake them: ‚ÄúYou wanted to know pain. I‚Äôll show you. I‚Äôll make you feel everything.‚Äù

The day began with them trying to repeat the ice-and-shock experiment. Their motions were clumsy. The battery slipped from their grasp, clanged to the floor, sending a spark. They flinched like a spooked animal.

‚ÄúLet me help,‚Äù I murmured. I steadied the wires, set the clamps, murmured clinical observations. They sagged with relief, as if my calmness anchored them.

Then, in a moment of distraction, I looped one of the wires around their wrist instead of mine. My heart hammered so loud I thought they could hear it.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trembling,‚Äù I said softly.

They looked at me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúDescribe,‚Äù they whispered, but their voice cracked.
I closed the circuit.

For the first time, they jerked, face contorting in a grimace that was almost pain but not quite ‚Äî more like terror, the body‚Äôs reflex without the nerve‚Äôs permission. They gasped. Their knees buckled.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù they whispered. But their eyes said otherwise.

I leaned close. ‚ÄúThis is what you wanted. This is how it begins.‚Äù

I turned up the current. Their arms convulsed, head snapping back against the brace. The sight filled me with a surge of something dark and clean ‚Äî not joy, but release. My hands no longer shook.

‚ÄúYou feel it,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúYou feel it now.‚Äù

Their mouth worked soundlessly. They were trying to form words but could not. I reached for the screwdriver, hidden in my waistband, and pressed the point just above their collarbone.

‚ÄúYour experiments are over,‚Äù I said.

They slumped in the chair like a puppet with the strings cut. The greenish light trembled on their sweat-slick face; their eyes were two black pools reflecting me back. For the first time since I‚Äôd been dragged into the basement, the air didn‚Äôt feel like a lid pressing down on me ‚Äî it felt full of cracks.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nothing without control,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôve lost it.‚Äù

They twitched, lips barely moving. ‚ÄúMore‚Ä¶please‚Ä¶‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt triumph I felt then but a bitter, metallic taste, like licking a battery. I realized this was my last chance; if I waited even another day, they might recover, or kill me in some erratic gesture. My fingers moved almost on their own, tightening the last strap across their chest until it creaked.

I pressed my palm against their sternum. The heart under my hand beat quick and hard, an animal trying to claw its way out. My own heart matched it. For a moment we were one trembling system, predator and prey trading places so quickly it became meaningless.
Then I pulled away.

The high window glowed faintly with sodium-orange light from outside. I climbed onto a crate, balancing on bare feet slippery with sweat. The screwdriver dug into my palm. Each squeal of metal as I worked the frame felt like a gunshot. My breath came in ragged bursts; my teeth chattered from adrenaline.

Below me the chair creaked. They stirred, but the straps held. Their voice, hoarse: ‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶going‚Ä¶‚Äù

I ignored it, wrenching harder. Rust flaked onto my arms, stinging like sparks. My wrists screamed from old restraints. A piece of the frame gave with a dry snap.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave,‚Äù they croaked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only‚Ä¶one‚Ä¶‚Äù

The screwdriver slipped, skittering to the floor with a clank. I almost sobbed. I dropped back down, snatched it up, and returned to the window. My hands shook so badly I could barely fit the tip into the crack. My vision blurred with tears.

Finally, with a sound like a rib breaking, the frame popped free. Cold night air slapped my face, smelling of rain and diesel and something clean ‚Äî the first clean smell in days. I wanted to bury my nose in it like a starving person finding food.

The opening was barely wider than my shoulders. Shards of glass jutted from the edges like teeth. I wrapped my hands in a filthy rag and hauled myself up. Every inch of my skin screamed as glass nicked me. My knees scraped the sill, opening new cuts. But compared to what had been done to me inside, the pain was clarifying, almost holy.

I was halfway out when a sound rose from below: a ragged, animal wail. They were thrashing against the straps now, head jerking like a fish. For the first time they were loud, truly loud ‚Äî a voice stripped of language.

‚ÄúCome back,‚Äù they howled. ‚ÄúCome back!‚Äù

I hauled myself through the last gap and tumbled onto gravel outside. I lay there on my back staring at the stars, my chest convulsing. The sky was huge and black and indifferent. The sodium light turned my tears into small coins on my cheeks.

My legs felt like brittle twigs but they moved. Gravel to asphalt, asphalt to an empty lot, lot to a chain-link fence. Each footstep was an explosion of nerve endings, but it was movement, and movement was freedom. I could feel the shape of my own body again, not as an object in a room but as something moving through space.

I didn‚Äôt look back. I didn‚Äôt have to; their cries bled out through the window and echoed across the lot like a dying animal. The sound pushed me faster.

I stumbled onto a street, half-lit by an old sodium lamp. A payphone stood there like an artifact from another era. I lunged for it, hands shaking so violently I almost dropped the receiver. The number for 911 came out of me as a sob.

‚ÄúHelp,‚Äù I croaked. ‚ÄúBasement. Kidnapper. Hurry‚Ä¶‚Äù

When the cruisers came, blue and red lights washing over the industrial yard, I crumpled at the edge of the lot. Their boots thudded around me, voices sharp and clipped. Hands guided me into a blanket, into the back of an ambulance. Someone asked my name. It took three tries to remember it.

I heard shouting from the basement. Then silence. Then radio chatter.

One officer returned, face pale. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one down there,‚Äù he said quietly to a colleague. ‚ÄúJust a chair bolted to the floor.‚Äù

Fluorescent lights again ‚Äî but soft, clean, sterile. IV tubing snaked into my arm, dripping clear fluid. Nurses murmured. Someone swabbed my cuts. The antiseptic smell made me gag. Every time I closed my eyes I saw diagrams on butcher paper, needles gleaming under green light.

A psychiatrist sat by my bed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe now,‚Äù she said gently. ‚ÄúYou were very brave.‚Äù

I stared at her and thought: Brave? No. Just the rat that finally found a hole.

At night I lay awake listening to the beep of monitors. My body was healing but my mind kept replaying the chair, the voice, the humming.

A week later, back in my apartment, the nightmares had begun to shift. Sometimes in them I wasn‚Äôt the one strapped to the chair ‚Äî I was the one doing the strapping, clinical and calm. I woke with my own hands clutching the sheets like restraints.

That morning an email arrived. No subject. No text. Just an attachment.
I clicked. It was a grainy photograph of my street taken from across the road. In the lower corner: a gloved hand holding a hypodermic needle, faintly gleaming. Under the image, a single line:

‚ÄúI think I felt it this time. Thank you.‚Äù

I sat frozen, staring at the screen. The city outside went on as if nothing had changed. But inside me, the world tilted, and I realized the experiment wasn‚Äôt over ‚Äî not for either of us.

1nvr72w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nvr72w/my_kidnapper_couldnt_feel_pain/,My Kidnapper Couldn‚Äôt Feel Pain,"I woke to a smell that shouldn‚Äôt have existed anywhere outside a morgue ‚Äî bleach cut with rust and something sour-metallic like coins held in the mouth. My head throbbed; my eyes refused to open at first. The dark was so complete it felt like fabric pressed to my face. When I tried to move, pain shot through my shoulders and up my neck. My arms were suspended above me.

The bindings were layers of torn cloth cinched tight with plastic zip ties. My hands had gone cold and pale, fingers tingling, almost blue. Each time I tried to shift, a new line of pain flared ‚Äî burning, stabbing, tearing ‚Äî radiating out from my joints like cracking glass.

Somewhere, a sound began: a low humming, tuneless, at first far away, then circling me. My heart slammed against my ribs. I tasted bile in the back of my throat.
The humming stopped. Footsteps scraped concrete. A metallic click. A single fluorescent bulb stuttered to life above me, casting a greenish glare across cinder block walls.

The walls were wrapped floor to ceiling in butcher paper. Anatomical diagrams scrawled in black ink covered every surface ‚Äî nervous systems, muscle groups, hospital pain scales with handwritten notations in the margins. Words like nociception, analgesia, stimulus written and underlined. In places the ink had bled, streaked downward like someone had pressed their face to it and wept.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake,‚Äù a voice said.

They stepped into the light. At first they looked like a tired grad student: thin frame, pale skin, dark hair hanging in their eyes. But their arms told a different story ‚Äî a network of pale scars crosshatched from wrist to elbow, stitched with surgical neatness. A missing fingertip sealed in shiny tissue. They wore a dark apron stiff with old stains.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad,‚Äù they said softly. ‚ÄúYou can help me understand.‚Äù

My mouth opened but only a hoarse rasp emerged. ‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ who are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey called me lucky. Congenital analgesia. No pain. But pain is how you know you‚Äôre alive.‚Äù

They raised a hand. A hypodermic needle pierced the fleshy web between thumb and forefinger. No blood. The wound had been cauterized. They twisted the steel shaft as if tuning an instrument. ‚ÄúThis should hurt,‚Äù they whispered. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs only pressure. Tell me ‚Äî what would this feel like to you?‚Äù

I stared at the hole in their hand, nausea rising like acid. ‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ burning glass,‚Äù I croaked. ‚ÄúGlass under the skin.‚Äù
Their pupils dilated. ‚ÄúBurning glass,‚Äù they repeated. ‚ÄúBetter than textbooks.‚Äù

They lowered me from the ceiling and bolted me into a wooden chair stained dark. My ankles were duct-taped to the legs; my wrists bound behind me. They draped a blanket across my shoulders ‚Äî smelling of rust and bleach ‚Äî like a caretaker preparing a patient.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll stay warmer this way,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúShivering corrupts the data.‚Äù

A clipboard appeared with fifty blank lines under Pain Vocabulary.

They began on themselves: hands plunged into ice water until their skin blued, then blasted with a blow dryer until flesh pinked, then blanched. Each time they asked me to describe it, my voice trembling.

‚ÄúNeedles under the skin,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGlass splinters. Heat like peeling sunburn alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeel you,‚Äù they murmured, writing it down.

Then it was my turn. A rubber band snapping against my forearm, a pinch of tweezers to the thin skin between thumb and index. Even minor acts were magnified by terror, the stench, the inevitability of escalation.

By night (if it was night ‚Äî the light never changed), my arms and hands trembled uncontrollably. My lips cracked from dryness. Tears streaked salt across my face. I pictured my apartment, my cat, the smell of coffee at dawn ‚Äî normal life turning alien and unreachable.

On the second day, their fascination intensified. A small hammer, a steel plate, and a scalpel lay waiting on a tray.

They placed their own left hand flat on the plate, raised the hammer, and brought it down. A sound like a branch snapping. Their index finger bent at an unnatural angle. They didn‚Äôt blink.

‚ÄúWhat would it feel like?‚Äù they hissed, eyes shining.
I gagged, bile rising. ‚ÄúEvery nerve screaming‚Ä¶ lightning inside‚Ä¶ something wrong, ripped apart.‚Äù

They closed their eyes, whispering: ‚ÄúWronged. Yes. That‚Äôs the one.‚Äù

Then came me. Rubber bands became clamps, tweezers became pinpricks of sharp metal. Every touch magnified by dread. My skin crawled. My nerves lit up like live wires.

I began crying without sound, tears running down my cheeks, soaking the blanket. My hands went numb. I tried to think of my name, my address, anything to anchor myself ‚Äî but the basement smell dragged me back: bleach, rust, cooked meat.

Hallucinations began at the edges: whispers in corners, my own reflection in puddles where none existed, the sense of someone standing behind me even when I knew we were alone.

On the third day, they introduced electricity.
A car battery appeared on a metal cart, wires dangling from crude clips. Sparks popped when they tested the connection, filling the basement with the scent of ozone. Their broken finger was splinted, stained brown at the tips.

They sketched diagrams of the experiment on the wall with chalk, neat as blueprints. ‚ÄúThis will be the one,‚Äù they whispered. ‚ÄúThis will let me feel.‚Äù

First they shocked themselves. Sparks danced along pale flesh. Muscles twitched, lips parted, but they barely blinked.

Then they turned to me.
The wires bit into my forearms like insect mandibles. My muscles seized violently, my heart slamming so hard I thought it would rupture. The smell of ozone and burning cloth made me gag.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúTell me what it feels like.‚Äù

‚ÄúFire,‚Äù I gasped. ‚ÄúFire in my veins. Needles full of fire.‚Äù

They closed their eyes. ‚ÄúFire in the veins. Yes‚Ä¶‚Äù

It was then I realized they weren‚Äôt immune to fear ‚Äî only to pain. Their hand trembled over the switch. Their breathing came fast. A flicker of uncertainty crossed their eyes as I began whispering.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing it wrong,‚Äù I rasped. ‚ÄúPain isn‚Äôt just sensation ‚Äî it‚Äôs fear, helplessness, losing control. You have to let go.‚Äù

They tilted their head. ‚ÄúFear. Losing control.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I whispered, throat raw. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the key.‚Äù
By the end of the third day, my reality had thinned to a filament.

My skin was a map of bruises and pinpricks.
My muscles trembled uncontrollably.
My mind slipped in and out of hallucination.
Memories of sunlight and human voices seemed like a book I‚Äôd read long ago.

But a seed had taken root: the understanding that fear was their weakness, and my only way out.

When I came to again, there was no sense of day or night ‚Äî just the single green bulb above me and a hollow ache through my arms and legs. My wrists were raw; the skin beneath the duct tape had turned angry red. My teeth chattered before I realized they‚Äôd placed a metal basin in front of me.

‚ÄúIce first,‚Äù they murmured. Their voice was thin from sleeplessness but eager.

They seized my hands, wrists clamped like a vise, and plunged them into the basin. The water was so cold it felt sharp. My fingers went bone-white, then blue. Pain raced up my arms in jagged streaks, each nerve shattering into splinters. My throat convulsed. I couldn‚Äôt tell if the sound coming out of me was a sob or a laugh.
‚ÄúDescribe,‚Äù they ordered, eyes on me as if I were the only object in the room.

‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ a hundred knives in the marrow‚Ä¶ like my bones are glass and someone‚Äôs rattling them,‚Äù I whispered.
They nodded, scribbling notes. Then, without warning, they drew my hands out and pressed warm cloths doused with some chemical that burned as it thawed my skin. The agony multiplied. My flesh felt as if it were peeling, nerve endings sparking like loose wires.

I thought of mornings in my apartment: sunlight cutting across a wooden floor, my cat blinking at me from the couch. It made me dizzy with grief. I had to swallow back a scream that wasn‚Äôt about the pain but the memory of normalcy.

‚ÄúShivering corrupts data,‚Äù they murmured again, almost fondly, and wrapped my shoulders in the damp blanket.

They rolled in the battery again. This time the wires were tipped with small clamps instead of crude paddles. Sparks popped when the clips met. Ozone stung my throat, metallic and acrid.

They clamped the wires to their own forearm first. The muscle jumped, the skin quivered, but they only breathed harder, eyes wide as though at the edge of revelation.

Then they turned to me.

When the current hit, my body went rigid. My jaw locked. My heart banged like a fist against my ribs. A taste like pennies filled my mouth. For a moment I thought my vision had shattered into glass shards.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù they whispered. ‚ÄúTell me what it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fire inside a cage,‚Äù I rasped. ‚ÄúLike metal claws dragging through me. Like‚Ä¶ like my blood turned to bees.‚Äù

They shuddered with a kind of hunger. ‚ÄúBlood turned to bees,‚Äù they repeated, writing furiously.

Something cracked inside me then. Between the burning of my skin and the trembling of my heart, I realized they were trembling too ‚Äî not from pain but from anticipation, from their own strange excitement. And I began to see the thin seam of weakness: fear.

I woke to find a steel contraption standing in the center of the basement. It looked like a chair and a trap had been fused together: clamps for wrists and ankles, a collar brace, and a frame of steel rods.

‚ÄúI built this for me,‚Äù they said quietly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll help me use it.‚Äù
My own terror rose up like bile. But some small hard core inside me whispered, This is your chance.

‚ÄúIf you want it to work,‚Äù I murmured, making my voice tremble but also low, hypnotic, ‚Äúyou have to let me set it up. You can‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming or it won‚Äôt work.‚Äù
They hesitated, then nodded.

I tightened the straps across their arms, their legs, their chest. Every buckle was a drumbeat in my ears. They shuddered as control slipped from their hands. Their breath came quick, pupils dilated.

‚ÄúYou have to believe you can‚Äôt escape,‚Äù I whispered near their ear.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù they breathed. ‚ÄúYes. Show me.‚Äù

I clipped the battery wires to the metal pads at the armrests. Their muscles twitched under the clamps. A guttural sound escaped them ‚Äî not pain but the first hint of genuine panic.

I could almost feel their terror radiating off them, electric, contagious. My own chest ached with adrenaline. I memorized their breathing, their expression. This is how they‚Äôll break.

The next day they tried a different approach. No implements. No lights except a low, pulsing glow from a bulb strung somewhere behind me. They left me alone for what felt like hours.

Dripping pipes became a heartbeat. Shadows in the corners flexed and turned toward me like living things. I began to hear faint footsteps that weren‚Äôt there, a low voice humming words I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. My own voice whispered back without my consent.

I pressed my forehead against my knees and tried to remember the layout of my apartment, the taste of oranges, the texture of my cat‚Äôs fur. Each memory warped as soon as I called it up, turning into something grotesque.

When they returned, they stood silently, head tilted, studying me as if my hallucinations were as important as my flesh.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre breaking,‚Äù they said softly. ‚ÄúFear amplifies everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I murmured hoarsely, realizing I could weaponize that truth.

By the eighth day, my sense of time had shredded. I measured it only by the sound of the pipes and the tremors of my own heart.

They brought back the ice water, the clamps, the battery, combining everything in rapid succession: cold so deep it burned, then heat, then electric shocks. My body reacted before my mind could; spasms, tears, animal sounds I barely recognized as mine.

But beneath the horror, I was learning. Learning their patterns. Learning how their breath changed when they were afraid. Learning how to speak in the tone that made them hesitate.

And a strange clarity came with that learning ‚Äî a knowledge that if I could hold on a little longer, I could turn their hunger for understanding into their undoing.

When I woke, the green bulb flickered erratically, throwing knife-thin shadows across the cinder blocks. My throat felt sandpaper-raw from screaming the day before. On the floor near me lay a spiral notebook open to a fresh page. Their handwriting crawled across it, neat but frantic, filled with diagrams and phrases:
‚ÄúPAIN = LIFE‚Äù
 ‚ÄúFIND THE EDGE‚Äù
 ‚ÄúSHE KNOWS MORE‚Äù

For a long time I stared at the words until they seemed to crawl like insects. The last line was underlined three times. She knows more. My stomach lurched ‚Äî they had begun to believe in me as a kind of oracle.

They entered with a tray of syringes, their eyes bloodshot. ‚ÄúTell me about hunger,‚Äù they murmured. ‚ÄúTell me about deprivation.‚Äù

They had not eaten either. Their hands shook. They placed the syringes down, then held one up, examining the needle‚Äôs shine. I realized in a rush: their obsession was hollowing them out. If I could deepen their dependence on my words, I could pry the cracks wider.

I whispered: ‚ÄúIf you want to understand deprivation‚Ä¶you have to give up something. Something you need.‚Äù

They hesitated, breath trembling. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúSleep,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúClose your eyes in the chair. I‚Äôll record everything.‚Äù

They stared at me a long time, then at the syringes, then at the chair. Slowly, almost reverently, they sat.

I strapped them in again. The steel frame clanged faintly with each buckle. My fingers shook, but I masked it with clinical efficiency. They closed their eyes, trusting me. A tremor of triumph passed through me like static.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll feel nothing,‚Äù they whispered.

‚ÄúYou want to learn something,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThat means letting go.‚Äù

I clipped sensors to their skin ‚Äî thin wires, a heart monitor I‚Äôd fashioned from scraps, anything to look real. Then, as they drifted in the edge of sleep, I whispered small things: ‚ÄúYour hands are heavy. Your breath slows. You are weaker than you think.‚Äù

They twitched. Their eyes flickered beneath lids.
I did not harm them yet. I only left them strapped, alone, as I backed away to a far corner. In that corner, hidden beneath a crate, I‚Äôd found a rusted screwdriver days before. I palmed it now, feeling the weight, the point. For the first time, the tool was in my hand.

They woke groggy. The green bulb had burned out sometime in the night, plunging everything into a dense amber glow from a backup lamp. Their voice was thin: ‚ÄúWhat did you see?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre closer to the edge now.‚Äù

I handed them a cracked mirror I‚Äôd scavenged. ‚ÄúLook at yourself.‚Äù

They stared. Their pupils dilated, skin pale and damp with sweat. For the first time, I saw something like shame flicker across their features. They looked as if they‚Äôd aged ten years overnight.

‚ÄúYou need me,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt understand pain alone. You‚Äôll destroy yourself before you find it.‚Äù
They clutched the mirror. It slipped and cut their palm. Blood welled up, dark and slow. They stared at it, fascinated and horrified at once. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶can‚Äôt feel it,‚Äù they murmured.

I leaned close: ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre bleeding. That‚Äôs the truth your nerves can‚Äôt hide.‚Äù

They shuddered. A tremor ran through their whole body. They were starting to doubt their invincibility ‚Äî the one thing keeping them upright.

Food came less and less. Their hands shook when they tried to pour water. Their speech frayed, full of unfinished sentences. They had begun to smell sour, like someone fevered.

They still performed small torments ‚Äî ice water, clamps ‚Äî but they were half-hearted now, distracted. Each time they struck, their eyes darted to me as if asking permission.

That day I didn‚Äôt scream. I stared straight through them, whispering descriptions without being prompted: ‚ÄúHot needles under my skin. Glass storm. Nerves screaming.‚Äù It unnerved them more than any cry.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not afraid,‚Äù they muttered
.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm past fear,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not.‚Äù

Their hands trembled so badly the clamp slipped and snapped against their own thumb. They hissed, startled, as if the absence of pain now frightened them more than the idea of pain itself.

They slept strapped in the chair that night. I had done the straps so tight their hands tinged purple. While they snored shallowly, I crept around the basement, mapping every corner, every bolt. I found the fuse box, the breaker, the small window high on the wall crusted with grime.

I tested the screwdriver against the window frame. Metal squealed softly but didn‚Äôt break. Yet. I knew with time I could pry it loose.

I also knew time was running out. They were spiraling fast, and a spiraling captor could still kill me by accident. I would have to break free during one of their experiments, when their hands were full.

I returned to them and whispered at their ear, not loud enough to wake them: ‚ÄúYou wanted to know pain. I‚Äôll show you. I‚Äôll make you feel everything.‚Äù

The day began with them trying to repeat the ice-and-shock experiment. Their motions were clumsy. The battery slipped from their grasp, clanged to the floor, sending a spark. They flinched like a spooked animal.

‚ÄúLet me help,‚Äù I murmured. I steadied the wires, set the clamps, murmured clinical observations. They sagged with relief, as if my calmness anchored them.

Then, in a moment of distraction, I looped one of the wires around their wrist instead of mine. My heart hammered so loud I thought they could hear it.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trembling,‚Äù I said softly.

They looked at me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúDescribe,‚Äù they whispered, but their voice cracked.
I closed the circuit.

For the first time, they jerked, face contorting in a grimace that was almost pain but not quite ‚Äî more like terror, the body‚Äôs reflex without the nerve‚Äôs permission. They gasped. Their knees buckled.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù they whispered. But their eyes said otherwise.

I leaned close. ‚ÄúThis is what you wanted. This is how it begins.‚Äù

I turned up the current. Their arms convulsed, head snapping back against the brace. The sight filled me with a surge of something dark and clean ‚Äî not joy, but release. My hands no longer shook.

‚ÄúYou feel it,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúYou feel it now.‚Äù

Their mouth worked soundlessly. They were trying to form words but could not. I reached for the screwdriver, hidden in my waistband, and pressed the point just above their collarbone.

‚ÄúYour experiments are over,‚Äù I said.

They slumped in the chair like a puppet with the strings cut. The greenish light trembled on their sweat-slick face; their eyes were two black pools reflecting me back. For the first time since I‚Äôd been dragged into the basement, the air didn‚Äôt feel like a lid pressing down on me ‚Äî it felt full of cracks.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nothing without control,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôve lost it.‚Äù

They twitched, lips barely moving. ‚ÄúMore‚Ä¶please‚Ä¶‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt triumph I felt then but a bitter, metallic taste, like licking a battery. I realized this was my last chance; if I waited even another day, they might recover, or kill me in some erratic gesture. My fingers moved almost on their own, tightening the last strap across their chest until it creaked.

I pressed my palm against their sternum. The heart under my hand beat quick and hard, an animal trying to claw its way out. My own heart matched it. For a moment we were one trembling system, predator and prey trading places so quickly it became meaningless.
Then I pulled away.

The high window glowed faintly with sodium-orange light from outside. I climbed onto a crate, balancing on bare feet slippery with sweat. The screwdriver dug into my palm. Each squeal of metal as I worked the frame felt like a gunshot. My breath came in ragged bursts; my teeth chattered from adrenaline.

Below me the chair creaked. They stirred, but the straps held. Their voice, hoarse: ‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶going‚Ä¶‚Äù

I ignored it, wrenching harder. Rust flaked onto my arms, stinging like sparks. My wrists screamed from old restraints. A piece of the frame gave with a dry snap.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave,‚Äù they croaked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only‚Ä¶one‚Ä¶‚Äù

The screwdriver slipped, skittering to the floor with a clank. I almost sobbed. I dropped back down, snatched it up, and returned to the window. My hands shook so badly I could barely fit the tip into the crack. My vision blurred with tears.

Finally, with a sound like a rib breaking, the frame popped free. Cold night air slapped my face, smelling of rain and diesel and something clean ‚Äî the first clean smell in days. I wanted to bury my nose in it like a starving person finding food.

The opening was barely wider than my shoulders. Shards of glass jutted from the edges like teeth. I wrapped my hands in a filthy rag and hauled myself up. Every inch of my skin screamed as glass nicked me. My knees scraped the sill, opening new cuts. But compared to what had been done to me inside, the pain was clarifying, almost holy.

I was halfway out when a sound rose from below: a ragged, animal wail. They were thrashing against the straps now, head jerking like a fish. For the first time they were loud, truly loud ‚Äî a voice stripped of language.

‚ÄúCome back,‚Äù they howled. ‚ÄúCome back!‚Äù

I hauled myself through the last gap and tumbled onto gravel outside. I lay there on my back staring at the stars, my chest convulsing. The sky was huge and black and indifferent. The sodium light turned my tears into small coins on my cheeks.

My legs felt like brittle twigs but they moved. Gravel to asphalt, asphalt to an empty lot, lot to a chain-link fence. Each footstep was an explosion of nerve endings, but it was movement, and movement was freedom. I could feel the shape of my own body again, not as an object in a room but as something moving through space.

I didn‚Äôt look back. I didn‚Äôt have to; their cries bled out through the window and echoed across the lot like a dying animal. The sound pushed me faster.

I stumbled onto a street, half-lit by an old sodium lamp. A payphone stood there like an artifact from another era. I lunged for it, hands shaking so violently I almost dropped the receiver. The number for 911 came out of me as a sob.

‚ÄúHelp,‚Äù I croaked. ‚ÄúBasement. Kidnapper. Hurry‚Ä¶‚Äù

When the cruisers came, blue and red lights washing over the industrial yard, I crumpled at the edge of the lot. Their boots thudded around me, voices sharp and clipped. Hands guided me into a blanket, into the back of an ambulance. Someone asked my name. It took three tries to remember it.

I heard shouting from the basement. Then silence. Then radio chatter.

One officer returned, face pale. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one down there,‚Äù he said quietly to a colleague. ‚ÄúJust a chair bolted to the floor.‚Äù

Fluorescent lights again ‚Äî but soft, clean, sterile. IV tubing snaked into my arm, dripping clear fluid. Nurses murmured. Someone swabbed my cuts. The antiseptic smell made me gag. Every time I closed my eyes I saw diagrams on butcher paper, needles gleaming under green light.

A psychiatrist sat by my bed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe now,‚Äù she said gently. ‚ÄúYou were very brave.‚Äù

I stared at her and thought: Brave? No. Just the rat that finally found a hole.
At night I lay awake listening to the beep of monitors. My body was healing but my mind kept replaying the chair, the voice, the humming.

A week later, back in my apartment, the nightmares had begun to shift. Sometimes in them I wasn‚Äôt the one strapped to the chair ‚Äî I was the one doing the strapping, clinical and calm. I woke with my own hands clutching the sheets like restraints.

That morning an email arrived. No subject. No text. Just an attachment.

I clicked. It was a grainy photograph of my street taken from across the road. In the lower corner: a gloved hand holding a hypodermic needle, faintly gleaming. Under the image, a single line:

‚ÄúI think I felt it this time. Thank you.‚Äù

I sat frozen, staring at the screen. The city outside went on as if nothing had changed. But inside me, the world tilted, and I realized the experiment wasn‚Äôt over ‚Äî not for either of us.

I turn it off after use so maybe something abt turning it off just erases the water reset?

Since the house is my friend's it's already furnished and there is a really big TV in the living room too.

Edit:
I have my own bathroom, but if there are guests that come once in a while on weekends to hang out and the first floor bathroom is occupied, they might use mine.

There is also another room that's not occupied that they let me use unless some guest will sleep over.",3,1759370065.0,Georgia,24,0.59,False
1nvr5cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/agi/comments/1nvr5cw/agi_copium_overall_employment_is_unrelated_to/,AGI Copium: Overall Employment is Unrelated to Technology Levels,"The number of jobs in any individual field or profession depends on the technology available, but overall employment, on average does not, for three simple reason:

1. Units produced per person is never infinite. No matter how good technology gets there is some number of humans needed per unit of production in any field (units including quality, quantity, and distribution speed). Printing documents is a highly automated task, but printing companies employ humans. These include management, sales, quality control, designers, equipment maintenance, procurement, property managers, marketers, etc. Even if these jobs use a lot of automation, humans are needed to decide, design, direct, and determine what they want, right now, specifically. The employment levels depend on how much demand there is for a product or service, combined with how many humans it takes per unit to produce. This bring us to:
2. Humans can absorb any amount of material luxury, make it mundane, and then want more. Two examples can demonstrate this clearly:
   * First, take a product that has improved faster than almost any other. The humble computer. We each have in our pockets a computer far more powerful than one that would have cost a billion dollars in our grandparents time, and would have taken up a warehouse of space. On average, do people think this is more than enough, or do they keep buying new phones and computers every few years to get a newer and better one?
   * Secondly, get in your time machine and fetch a nomadic hunter-gatherer from 10,000 years ago, a biologically modern human, and bring them to a world with supermarkets. What an unimaginable luxury having more food than they knew existed, a few minutes away, for the price of a modest amount of labour. Compare it to the constant struggle for food and survival that they're used to. Yet we generally find this unremarkable. Boring, even. Now add another leap in convenience and luxury of an equal measure. Let's say virtually any product in the world that you can buy today, not just those in nearby shops, but anything from anywhere, will be delivered within minutes by a drone to wherever you are at the time. You don't know or care where it's made or warehoused, or when it was made. Maybe it was manufactured when you pressed ""buy"". All you know is you press the buy button and you have it a few minutes later. How long until this becomes normal? How long is it remarkable that you're sitting at a cafe and someone mentions a great pair of hiking shoes they saw recently and you press a button and have them in hand before you finish your coffee. This is convenient, but before long, common. We'll start to complain that some desired feature is missing from these particular shoes, or the price is a bit high. Similarly if we could travel to space as easily as we can travel to the city centre. Well now we complain that it takes so many weeks to reach mars, because the moon is too touristy these days.
3. Actual employment levels, at any given time, depend on a dozen levers controlled by the government and governing bodies: interest rates, tax rates, employment laws, minimum wages, grants, deductions and incentives, direct investment, competition laws, government procurement, public-private partnerships, wars, tarrfis, welfare, and infrastructure spending. Sure, capitalists do create companies and employ people, no question, but they're playing on a board, using game tokens, and following rules that were all created by the state.

Overall employment is a political question, not a technological one.

Unemployment has been much higher at points in the past when we had much worse technology and lower automation. It's also been much lower at other times in the past. It varies a great deal over history, and is quite low today, despite our extremely advanced technology.

AI will affect individual jobs and industries, but not long term employment levels. Even if we all had a generous UBI, people will just start their own enterprsies more often,  pursuing whatever crazy idea they have, and free to fail with a safety net.",0,1759369975.0,agi,0,0.5,False

1nvr4m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nvr4m0/my_kidnapper_couldnt_feel_pain/,My Kidnapper Couldn‚Äôt Feel Pain,"I woke to a smell that shouldn‚Äôt have existed anywhere outside a morgue ‚Äî bleach cut with rust and something sour-metallic like coins held in the mouth. My head throbbed; my eyes refused to open at first. The dark was so complete it felt like fabric pressed to my face. When I tried to move, pain shot through my shoulders and up my neck. My arms were suspended above me.

The bindings were layers of torn cloth cinched tight with plastic zip ties. My hands had gone cold and pale, fingers tingling, almost blue. Each time I tried to shift, a new line of pain flared ‚Äî burning, stabbing, tearing ‚Äî radiating out from my joints like cracking glass.

Somewhere, a sound began: a low humming, tuneless, at first far away, then circling me. My heart slammed against my ribs. I tasted bile in the back of my throat.
The humming stopped. Footsteps scraped concrete. A metallic click. A single fluorescent bulb stuttered to life above me, casting a greenish glare across cinder block walls.

The walls were wrapped floor to ceiling in butcher paper. Anatomical diagrams scrawled in black ink covered every surface ‚Äî nervous systems, muscle groups, hospital pain scales with handwritten notations in the margins. Words like nociception, analgesia, stimulus written and underlined. In places the ink had bled, streaked downward like someone had pressed their face to it and wept.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake,‚Äù a voice said.

They stepped into the light. At first they looked like a tired grad student: thin frame, pale skin, dark hair hanging in their eyes. But their arms told a different story ‚Äî a network of pale scars crosshatched from wrist to elbow, stitched with surgical neatness. A missing fingertip sealed in shiny tissue. They wore a dark apron stiff with old stains.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad,‚Äù they said softly. ‚ÄúYou can help me understand.‚Äù

My mouth opened but only a hoarse rasp emerged. ‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ who are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey called me lucky. Congenital analgesia. No pain. But pain is how you know you‚Äôre alive.‚Äù

They raised a hand. A hypodermic needle pierced the fleshy web between thumb and forefinger. No blood. The wound had been cauterized. They twisted the steel shaft as if tuning an instrument. ‚ÄúThis should hurt,‚Äù they whispered. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs only pressure. Tell me ‚Äî what would this feel like to you?‚Äù

I stared at the hole in their hand, nausea rising like acid. ‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ burning glass,‚Äù I croaked. ‚ÄúGlass under the skin.‚Äù
Their pupils dilated. ‚ÄúBurning glass,‚Äù they repeated. ‚ÄúBetter than textbooks.‚Äù

They lowered me from the ceiling and bolted me into a wooden chair stained dark. My ankles were duct-taped to the legs; my wrists bound behind me. They draped a blanket across my shoulders ‚Äî smelling of rust and bleach ‚Äî like a caretaker preparing a patient.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll stay warmer this way,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúShivering corrupts the data.‚Äù

A clipboard appeared with fifty blank lines under Pain Vocabulary.

They began on themselves: hands plunged into ice water until their skin blued, then blasted with a blow dryer until flesh pinked, then blanched. Each time they asked me to describe it, my voice trembling.

‚ÄúNeedles under the skin,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGlass splinters. Heat like peeling sunburn alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeel you,‚Äù they murmured, writing it down.

Then it was my turn. A rubber band snapping against my forearm, a pinch of tweezers to the thin skin between thumb and index. Even minor acts were magnified by terror, the stench, the inevitability of escalation.

By night (if it was night ‚Äî the light never changed), my arms and hands trembled uncontrollably. My lips cracked from dryness. Tears streaked salt across my face. I pictured my apartment, my cat, the smell of coffee at dawn ‚Äî normal life turning alien and unreachable.

On the second day, their fascination intensified. A small hammer, a steel plate, and a scalpel lay waiting on a tray.

They placed their own left hand flat on the plate, raised the hammer, and brought it down. A sound like a branch snapping. Their index finger bent at an unnatural angle. They didn‚Äôt blink.

‚ÄúWhat would it feel like?‚Äù they hissed, eyes shining.
I gagged, bile rising. ‚ÄúEvery nerve screaming‚Ä¶ lightning inside‚Ä¶ something wrong, ripped apart.‚Äù

They closed their eyes, whispering: ‚ÄúWronged. Yes. That‚Äôs the one.‚Äù

Then came me. Rubber bands became clamps, tweezers became pinpricks of sharp metal. Every touch magnified by dread. My skin crawled. My nerves lit up like live wires.

I began crying without sound, tears running down my cheeks, soaking the blanket. My hands went numb. I tried to think of my name, my address, anything to anchor myself ‚Äî but the basement smell dragged me back: bleach, rust, cooked meat.

Hallucinations began at the edges: whispers in corners, my own reflection in puddles where none existed, the sense of someone standing behind me even when I knew we were alone.

On the third day, they introduced electricity.
A car battery appeared on a metal cart, wires dangling from crude clips. Sparks popped when they tested the connection, filling the basement with the scent of ozone. Their broken finger was splinted, stained brown at the tips.

They sketched diagrams of the experiment on the wall with chalk, neat as blueprints. ‚ÄúThis will be the one,‚Äù they whispered. ‚ÄúThis will let me feel.‚Äù

First they shocked themselves. Sparks danced along pale flesh. Muscles twitched, lips parted, but they barely blinked.

Then they turned to me.
The wires bit into my forearms like insect mandibles. My muscles seized violently, my heart slamming so hard I thought it would rupture. The smell of ozone and burning cloth made me gag.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúTell me what it feels like.‚Äù

‚ÄúFire,‚Äù I gasped. ‚ÄúFire in my veins. Needles full of fire.‚Äù

They closed their eyes. ‚ÄúFire in the veins. Yes‚Ä¶‚Äù

It was then I realized they weren‚Äôt immune to fear ‚Äî only to pain. Their hand trembled over the switch. Their breathing came fast. A flicker of uncertainty crossed their eyes as I began whispering.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing it wrong,‚Äù I rasped. ‚ÄúPain isn‚Äôt just sensation ‚Äî it‚Äôs fear, helplessness, losing control. You have to let go.‚Äù

They tilted their head. ‚ÄúFear. Losing control.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I whispered, throat raw. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the key.‚Äù
By the end of the third day, my reality had thinned to a filament.

My skin was a map of bruises and pinpricks.
My muscles trembled uncontrollably.
My mind slipped in and out of hallucination.
Memories of sunlight and human voices seemed like a book I‚Äôd read long ago.

But a seed had taken root: the understanding that fear was their weakness, and my only way out.

When I came to again, there was no sense of day or night ‚Äî just the single green bulb above me and a hollow ache through my arms and legs. My wrists were raw; the skin beneath the duct tape had turned angry red. My teeth chattered before I realized they‚Äôd placed a metal basin in front of me.

‚ÄúIce first,‚Äù they murmured. Their voice was thin from sleeplessness but eager.

They seized my hands, wrists clamped like a vise, and plunged them into the basin. The water was so cold it felt sharp. My fingers went bone-white, then blue. Pain raced up my arms in jagged streaks, each nerve shattering into splinters. My throat convulsed. I couldn‚Äôt tell if the sound coming out of me was a sob or a laugh.
‚ÄúDescribe,‚Äù they ordered, eyes on me as if I were the only object in the room.

‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ a hundred knives in the marrow‚Ä¶ like my bones are glass and someone‚Äôs rattling them,‚Äù I whispered.
They nodded, scribbling notes. Then, without warning, they drew my hands out and pressed warm cloths doused with some chemical that burned as it thawed my skin. The agony multiplied. My flesh felt as if it were peeling, nerve endings sparking like loose wires.

I thought of mornings in my apartment: sunlight cutting across a wooden floor, my cat blinking at me from the couch. It made me dizzy with grief. I had to swallow back a scream that wasn‚Äôt about the pain but the memory of normalcy.

‚ÄúShivering corrupts data,‚Äù they murmured again, almost fondly, and wrapped my shoulders in the damp blanket.

They rolled in the battery again. This time the wires were tipped with small clamps instead of crude paddles. Sparks popped when the clips met. Ozone stung my throat, metallic and acrid.

They clamped the wires to their own forearm first. The muscle jumped, the skin quivered, but they only breathed harder, eyes wide as though at the edge of revelation.

Then they turned to me.

When the current hit, my body went rigid. My jaw locked. My heart banged like a fist against my ribs. A taste like pennies filled my mouth. For a moment I thought my vision had shattered into glass shards.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù they whispered. ‚ÄúTell me what it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fire inside a cage,‚Äù I rasped. ‚ÄúLike metal claws dragging through me. Like‚Ä¶ like my blood turned to bees.‚Äù

They shuddered with a kind of hunger. ‚ÄúBlood turned to bees,‚Äù they repeated, writing furiously.

Something cracked inside me then. Between the burning of my skin and the trembling of my heart, I realized they were trembling too ‚Äî not from pain but from anticipation, from their own strange excitement. And I began to see the thin seam of weakness: fear.

I woke to find a steel contraption standing in the center of the basement. It looked like a chair and a trap had been fused together: clamps for wrists and ankles, a collar brace, and a frame of steel rods.

‚ÄúI built this for me,‚Äù they said quietly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll help me use it.‚Äù
My own terror rose up like bile. But some small hard core inside me whispered, This is your chance.

‚ÄúIf you want it to work,‚Äù I murmured, making my voice tremble but also low, hypnotic, ‚Äúyou have to let me set it up. You can‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming or it won‚Äôt work.‚Äù
They hesitated, then nodded.

I tightened the straps across their arms, their legs, their chest. Every buckle was a drumbeat in my ears. They shuddered as control slipped from their hands. Their breath came quick, pupils dilated.

‚ÄúYou have to believe you can‚Äôt escape,‚Äù I whispered near their ear.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù they breathed. ‚ÄúYes. Show me.‚Äù

I clipped the battery wires to the metal pads at the armrests. Their muscles twitched under the clamps. A guttural sound escaped them ‚Äî not pain but the first hint of genuine panic.

I could almost feel their terror radiating off them, electric, contagious. My own chest ached with adrenaline. I memorized their breathing, their expression. This is how they‚Äôll break.

The next day they tried a different approach. No implements. No lights except a low, pulsing glow from a bulb strung somewhere behind me. They left me alone for what felt like hours.

Dripping pipes became a heartbeat. Shadows in the corners flexed and turned toward me like living things. I began to hear faint footsteps that weren‚Äôt there, a low voice humming words I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. My own voice whispered back without my consent.

I pressed my forehead against my knees and tried to remember the layout of my apartment, the taste of oranges, the texture of my cat‚Äôs fur. Each memory warped as soon as I called it up, turning into something grotesque.

When they returned, they stood silently, head tilted, studying me as if my hallucinations were as important as my flesh.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre breaking,‚Äù they said softly. ‚ÄúFear amplifies everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I murmured hoarsely, realizing I could weaponize that truth.

By the eighth day, my sense of time had shredded. I measured it only by the sound of the pipes and the tremors of my own heart.

They brought back the ice water, the clamps, the battery, combining everything in rapid succession: cold so deep it burned, then heat, then electric shocks. My body reacted before my mind could; spasms, tears, animal sounds I barely recognized as mine.

But beneath the horror, I was learning. Learning their patterns. Learning how their breath changed when they were afraid. Learning how to speak in the tone that made them hesitate.

And a strange clarity came with that learning ‚Äî a knowledge that if I could hold on a little longer, I could turn their hunger for understanding into their undoing.

When I woke, the green bulb flickered erratically, throwing knife-thin shadows across the cinder blocks. My throat felt sandpaper-raw from screaming the day before. On the floor near me lay a spiral notebook open to a fresh page. Their handwriting crawled across it, neat but frantic, filled with diagrams and phrases:
‚ÄúPAIN = LIFE‚Äù
 ‚ÄúFIND THE EDGE‚Äù
 ‚ÄúSHE KNOWS MORE‚Äù

For a long time I stared at the words until they seemed to crawl like insects. The last line was underlined three times. She knows more. My stomach lurched ‚Äî they had begun to believe in me as a kind of oracle.

They entered with a tray of syringes, their eyes bloodshot. ‚ÄúTell me about hunger,‚Äù they murmured. ‚ÄúTell me about deprivation.‚Äù

They had not eaten either. Their hands shook. They placed the syringes down, then held one up, examining the needle‚Äôs shine. I realized in a rush: their obsession was hollowing them out. If I could deepen their dependence on my words, I could pry the cracks wider.

I whispered: ‚ÄúIf you want to understand deprivation‚Ä¶you have to give up something. Something you need.‚Äù

They hesitated, breath trembling. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúSleep,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúClose your eyes in the chair. I‚Äôll record everything.‚Äù

They stared at me a long time, then at the syringes, then at the chair. Slowly, almost reverently, they sat.

I strapped them in again. The steel frame clanged faintly with each buckle. My fingers shook, but I masked it with clinical efficiency. They closed their eyes, trusting me. A tremor of triumph passed through me like static.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll feel nothing,‚Äù they whispered.

‚ÄúYou want to learn something,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThat means letting go.‚Äù

I clipped sensors to their skin ‚Äî thin wires, a heart monitor I‚Äôd fashioned from scraps, anything to look real. Then, as they drifted in the edge of sleep, I whispered small things: ‚ÄúYour hands are heavy. Your breath slows. You are weaker than you think.‚Äù

They twitched. Their eyes flickered beneath lids.
I did not harm them yet. I only left them strapped, alone, as I backed away to a far corner. In that corner, hidden beneath a crate, I‚Äôd found a rusted screwdriver days before. I palmed it now, feeling the weight, the point. For the first time, the tool was in my hand.

They woke groggy. The green bulb had burned out sometime in the night, plunging everything into a dense amber glow from a backup lamp. Their voice was thin: ‚ÄúWhat did you see?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre closer to the edge now.‚Äù

I handed them a cracked mirror I‚Äôd scavenged. ‚ÄúLook at yourself.‚Äù

They stared. Their pupils dilated, skin pale and damp with sweat. For the first time, I saw something like shame flicker across their features. They looked as if they‚Äôd aged ten years overnight.

‚ÄúYou need me,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt understand pain alone. You‚Äôll destroy yourself before you find it.‚Äù
They clutched the mirror. It slipped and cut their palm. Blood welled up, dark and slow. They stared at it, fascinated and horrified at once. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶can‚Äôt feel it,‚Äù they murmured.

I leaned close: ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre bleeding. That‚Äôs the truth your nerves can‚Äôt hide.‚Äù

They shuddered. A tremor ran through their whole body. They were starting to doubt their invincibility ‚Äî the one thing keeping them upright.

Food came less and less. Their hands shook when they tried to pour water. Their speech frayed, full of unfinished sentences. They had begun to smell sour, like someone fevered.

They still performed small torments ‚Äî ice water, clamps ‚Äî but they were half-hearted now, distracted. Each time they struck, their eyes darted to me as if asking permission.

That day I didn‚Äôt scream. I stared straight through them, whispering descriptions without being prompted: ‚ÄúHot needles under my skin. Glass storm. Nerves screaming.‚Äù It unnerved them more than any cry.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not afraid,‚Äù they muttered
.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm past fear,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not.‚Äù

Their hands trembled so badly the clamp slipped and snapped against their own thumb. They hissed, startled, as if the absence of pain now frightened them more than the idea of pain itself.

They slept strapped in the chair that night. I had done the straps so tight their hands tinged purple. While they snored shallowly, I crept around the basement, mapping every corner, every bolt. I found the fuse box, the breaker, the small window high on the wall crusted with grime.

I tested the screwdriver against the window frame. Metal squealed softly but didn‚Äôt break. Yet. I knew with time I could pry it loose.

I also knew time was running out. They were spiraling fast, and a spiraling captor could still kill me by accident. I would have to break free during one of their experiments, when their hands were full.

I returned to them and whispered at their ear, not loud enough to wake them: ‚ÄúYou wanted to know pain. I‚Äôll show you. I‚Äôll make you feel everything.‚Äù

The day began with them trying to repeat the ice-and-shock experiment. Their motions were clumsy. The battery slipped from their grasp, clanged to the floor, sending a spark. They flinched like a spooked animal.

‚ÄúLet me help,‚Äù I murmured. I steadied the wires, set the clamps, murmured clinical observations. They sagged with relief, as if my calmness anchored them.

Then, in a moment of distraction, I looped one of the wires around their wrist instead of mine. My heart hammered so loud I thought they could hear it.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trembling,‚Äù I said softly.

They looked at me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúDescribe,‚Äù they whispered, but their voice cracked.
I closed the circuit.

For the first time, they jerked, face contorting in a grimace that was almost pain but not quite ‚Äî more like terror, the body‚Äôs reflex without the nerve‚Äôs permission. They gasped. Their knees buckled.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù they whispered. But their eyes said otherwise.

I leaned close. ‚ÄúThis is what you wanted. This is how it begins.‚Äù

I turned up the current. Their arms convulsed, head snapping back against the brace. The sight filled me with a surge of something dark and clean ‚Äî not joy, but release. My hands no longer shook.

‚ÄúYou feel it,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúYou feel it now.‚Äù

Their mouth worked soundlessly. They were trying to form words but could not. I reached for the screwdriver, hidden in my waistband, and pressed the point just above their collarbone.

‚ÄúYour experiments are over,‚Äù I said.

They slumped in the chair like a puppet with the strings cut. The greenish light trembled on their sweat-slick face; their eyes were two black pools reflecting me back. For the first time since I‚Äôd been dragged into the basement, the air didn‚Äôt feel like a lid pressing down on me ‚Äî it felt full of cracks.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nothing without control,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôve lost it.‚Äù

They twitched, lips barely moving. ‚ÄúMore‚Ä¶please‚Ä¶‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt triumph I felt then but a bitter, metallic taste, like licking a battery. I realized this was my last chance; if I waited even another day, they might recover, or kill me in some erratic gesture. My fingers moved almost on their own, tightening the last strap across their chest until it creaked.

I pressed my palm against their sternum. The heart under my hand beat quick and hard, an animal trying to claw its way out. My own heart matched it. For a moment we were one trembling system, predator and prey trading places so quickly it became meaningless.
Then I pulled away.

The high window glowed faintly with sodium-orange light from outside. I climbed onto a crate, balancing on bare feet slippery with sweat. The screwdriver dug into my palm. Each squeal of metal as I worked the frame felt like a gunshot. My breath came in ragged bursts; my teeth chattered from adrenaline.

Below me the chair creaked. They stirred, but the straps held. Their voice, hoarse: ‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶going‚Ä¶‚Äù

I ignored it, wrenching harder. Rust flaked onto my arms, stinging like sparks. My wrists screamed from old restraints. A piece of the frame gave with a dry snap.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave,‚Äù they croaked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only‚Ä¶one‚Ä¶‚Äù

The screwdriver slipped, skittering to the floor with a clank. I almost sobbed. I dropped back down, snatched it up, and returned to the window. My hands shook so badly I could barely fit the tip into the crack. My vision blurred with tears.

Finally, with a sound like a rib breaking, the frame popped free. Cold night air slapped my face, smelling of rain and diesel and something clean ‚Äî the first clean smell in days. I wanted to bury my nose in it like a starving person finding food.

The opening was barely wider than my shoulders. Shards of glass jutted from the edges like teeth. I wrapped my hands in a filthy rag and hauled myself up. Every inch of my skin screamed as glass nicked me. My knees scraped the sill, opening new cuts. But compared to what had been done to me inside, the pain was clarifying, almost holy.

I was halfway out when a sound rose from below: a ragged, animal wail. They were thrashing against the straps now, head jerking like a fish. For the first time they were loud, truly loud ‚Äî a voice stripped of language.

‚ÄúCome back,‚Äù they howled. ‚ÄúCome back!‚Äù

I hauled myself through the last gap and tumbled onto gravel outside. I lay there on my back staring at the stars, my chest convulsing. The sky was huge and black and indifferent. The sodium light turned my tears into small coins on my cheeks.

My legs felt like brittle twigs but they moved. Gravel to asphalt, asphalt to an empty lot, lot to a chain-link fence. Each footstep was an explosion of nerve endings, but it was movement, and movement was freedom. I could feel the shape of my own body again, not as an object in a room but as something moving through space.

I didn‚Äôt look back. I didn‚Äôt have to; their cries bled out through the window and echoed across the lot like a dying animal. The sound pushed me faster.

I stumbled onto a street, half-lit by an old sodium lamp. A payphone stood there like an artifact from another era. I lunged for it, hands shaking so violently I almost dropped the receiver. The number for 911 came out of me as a sob.

‚ÄúHelp,‚Äù I croaked. ‚ÄúBasement. Kidnapper. Hurry‚Ä¶‚Äù

When the cruisers came, blue and red lights washing over the industrial yard, I crumpled at the edge of the lot. Their boots thudded around me, voices sharp and clipped. Hands guided me into a blanket, into the back of an ambulance. Someone asked my name. It took three tries to remember it.

I heard shouting from the basement. Then silence. Then radio chatter.

One officer returned, face pale. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one down there,‚Äù he said quietly to a colleague. ‚ÄúJust a chair bolted to the floor.‚Äù

Fluorescent lights again ‚Äî but soft, clean, sterile. IV tubing snaked into my arm, dripping clear fluid. Nurses murmured. Someone swabbed my cuts. The antiseptic smell made me gag. Every time I closed my eyes I saw diagrams on butcher paper, needles gleaming under green light.

A psychiatrist sat by my bed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe now,‚Äù she said gently. ‚ÄúYou were very brave.‚Äù

I stared at her and thought: Brave? No. Just the rat that finally found a hole.

At night I lay awake listening to the beep of monitors. My body was healing but my mind kept replaying the chair, the voice, the humming.

A week later, back in my apartment, the nightmares had begun to shift. Sometimes in them I wasn‚Äôt the one strapped to the chair ‚Äî I was the one doing the strapping, clinical and calm. I woke with my own hands clutching the sheets like restraints.

That morning an email arrived. No subject. No text. Just an attachment.

Back again with my weekly post about sleep. I‚Äôm exaggerating. Kind of. 

I am desperate to fix my sleep FAST. Or however fast one can that it will stick and stop ruining my life. 

I write this at nearly 3am. I was supposed to go into work tomorrow in the city. I have had to write an apologetic email because it‚Äôs now impossible for me to make it there in any reasonable time without only sleeping a few hours. 

Why are you on your phone right now? That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt sleep - I can imagine you‚Äôre thinking - and you aren‚Äôt wrong BUT I had to pick up the phone to write the email because it was clear that I had passed the point of no return, and it seemed important to give the team a heads up and explain the situation, and hope this would calm me knowing I‚Äôd covered the necessary bases, done all I could (short of arriving their an irritable zombie and had a potentially worse knock-on effect of sleep deprivation for days to come. 

Okay but why are you now on Reddit? Well this one‚Äôs a bit less explicable. But I thought perhaps I could plant a seed and see if I could get the hive mind to work on my problem while I was sleeping,  and perhaps this was time well spent and would be rewarded tomorrow, I could wake up with a glorious backlog of brilliant suggestions delivered right to me, solving my sleep problems, and therefore finally fixing my life once and for all. 

Or nobody will comment. That‚Äôs what happens most of the time. 

Seriously how did you fix this? Help.

New Gear Check:
*Cockpit Fairing (Fly/Windscreen): Adds a nice little aggressive edge and definitely helps with the wind at top speed. It‚Äôs a subtle but cool look. Ordered it from a website in Europe for a reasonable buck. 

*Sleek Mirrors: I swapped the big stock mirrors for these adjustable beauties from AliExpress. They look so much cleaner and fit the bike's vibe perfectly. Best budget upgrade for aesthetics!

*Quad Lock Phone Mount: Out with the stock, in with the best! It wasn't a perfect bolt-on, but after a little jigging and DIY, I got my Quad Lock securely mounted.

 *Air Cushion: Took a chance on this from Amazon and wow, a slight improvement in comfort is exactly what I needed for those longer city jaunts. Every little bit helps with the stock seat! 

 *Top Box: Game changer for practicality (coming from a DIY bicycle basket solution)! It's so nice to have secure storage. As you can see, I keep my charger in there, and the diamond-patterned lining looks surprisingly classy, even though it's a cheap Temu find.

The Charging Grind:
I'm here plugged into a public Level 2 charger using an adapter and the optional quick charger, which technically is still maxed out at about Level 1 speeds (around 1.2 kW or 1.5 kW depending on the specific charger model). It's not fast, but the huge win is being able to utilize the ubiquitous public EV infrastructure. It's the convenience of where I can charge, not the speed!

In my younger years, I believed in the undeniable truth that darkness and light coexisted, woven into the very atoms of the universe. There was good and there was bad. Period. And, if a person could but walk the straight and narrow path, they could be considered a hero in their own right. After all, that was what made me idolize those flights of fancy printed colorfully on pulp pages.‚Äù

*Click*

I sighed, dragging on my Camel and the cigarette was half ash already. The old lady wouldn‚Äôt have liked me smoking again, but under the circumstances, I think she would have understood.

I stared at the tape recorder in my hand, avoiding the photos in the file. I couldn‚Äôt look at them again. Instead, I took another puff of the cancer mist before exhaling.

Yeah, Betsy *would* have understood.

I crushed the cigarette onto a newspaper clipping of the so-called miracle doctor - then lit another.

*Click*

‚ÄúIt was not until I was older that I found the shadow between the two -the gray, if you prefer- was a much more prevalent state than light and darkness, good and bad, or hero and villain. But now? Now I am convinced that I was incorrect. Darkness, true darkness exists. You will see it, sheriff, between the stars, deep beneath the waves, and in the hearts of even those you claim as innocent. There are no ‚Äòvictims;‚Äô just lesser shadows overpowered and consumed by a greater blackness.‚Äù

*Click*

‚ÄúGoddamn monster,‚Äù I grumbled to myself before setting the recorder on my desk.

Miracle man of the valley.

Everyone in Styx knew of or knew the doctor. He was a bright spot that brought attention to a sleepy town where the buildings and people were slowly aging into oblivion. Unfortunately, now it looked as if his reputation was about to grow and so would the attention on my small little town.

I looked at the monitor. The grainy TV feed didn‚Äôt hide the doctor‚Äôs stare. His eyes, sharp despite the blur, seemed to lock onto mine through the screen. There was a sharp, salty smell all of the sudden.

I shivered with the chill traveling down my spine.

Still looking directly at the camera, the doctor smiled with his perfect pearl white teeth and took a sip of water from the paper cup before crumpling it in his hands. The jingle of his cuffs and chains filled the small room and was loud enough that I heard it through the paper thin wall next to me.

‚ÄúSheriff Grady,‚Äù he called in a singsong voice loud enough to be heard through the wall, ‚Äúsmoking is a filthy habit.‚Äù

I sighed and rubbed my temples, ready to be done with the shrink. The state trooper couldn‚Äôt get here soon enough. I had twenty-four peaceful years as sheriff without anything more dangerous than the McCaffery boys drinking, driving, and smashing mailboxes with a bat. Now? Now there was blood in the water; sharks were circling toward us with press passes and cameras; and bodies were piled into a grotesque mound in the funeral parlor beneath my feet.

‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt gonna go back in there, are ya?‚Äù Henry asked from the kitchen doorway, voice low. At least, I hoped it was low enough.

Henry walked across my office, which was little more than the kitchen of the converted house that contained both my ‚Äúoffice‚Äù on the first floor as well as the town mortuary in the basement. As the mortician and backup deputy whenever I needed it, Henry knew the doctor‚Äôs handiwork probably better than me.

Henry leaned against the teal painted cabinetry and yanked bloodied rubber gloves off his hands before. He had been hard at work on the Johnson boy‚Äôs body. Or what was left of it after the doctor had finished with it.

‚ÄúThe coffee is stale,‚Äù he said to me, but that didn‚Äôt stop Henry from drinking it.

‚ÄúHeat it up, then.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo reason,‚Äù Henry replied, downing the remainder of the mug like a shot. ‚ÄúI doubt we‚Äôre getting any warmth tonight.‚Äù

I just grunted and pulled out the old Jack from my desk. He held his cup up for some, and we made a silent toast to the dismembered boy below.

I shivered and wrinkled my nose at the smell of an incoming tide.

‚ÄúYou get anything out of him?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing useful.‚Äù I blackened the other eye in the clipping with the cigarette butt before using Henry‚Äôs empty mug as my ashtray. ‚ÄúThe good Dr. E. J. Christiansen is a narcissist. He talks like he wants to be one of those killers getting interviews on the evening news.‚Äù

Dr. Christiansen spoke like what my pa would have called ‚Äòa damnable flapping asshole of a pretentious prick.‚Äô One of my father‚Äôs pearls of wisdom would have made me smile in other circumstances. Not now.

Either way, it was as if the miracle doctor seemed to hope his over-familiarity with an earmarked thesaurus might make him a little less forgettable. But he could throw all the fancy words and phrases he wanted into this diatribe, but I planned to forget Dr. Christiansen as soon as the man was stuffed into the darkest corner the county jail had to offer. The inmates would take care of the child murderer after that.

At least, I hoped so.

I looked at the TV showing the doctor who was still handcuffed and chained in the ‚Äúinterrogation‚Äù room. That room used to be a kid‚Äôs bedroom. Now a monster sat inside it. That wasn‚Äôt lost on me.

‚ÄúAny news on how long the staties would take to get here?‚Äù I asked.

Henry shook his head and said, ‚ÄúNot a peep. But it might have to do with the buster of a storm we got brewing out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúStorm?‚Äù I strained my ears, but it seemed quiet outside.

‚ÄúBeen all over the local radio,‚Äù Henry responded. ‚ÄúPopped up out of nowhere and is raging in Helena. Already killed two at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone we know?‚Äù

‚ÄúOld Henderson and his boy coming back from fishing.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn.‚Äù

‚ÄúSwept them and their truck right down the edge of the valley and wrapped them around a tree,‚Äù Henry said. ‚ÄúProbably wouldn‚Äôt have been known about neither if Clive hadn‚Äôt been a couple of hundred yards behind them. Said it was like a giant hand had swatted them off the road like a fly. Told Clive they would have to store the bodies in the Helena butcher freezer. We don‚Äôt have the room.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù I repeated dumbly before lighting another cigarette. More bodies of people I knew growing cold before the sun set on that awful day.

*Click*

‚ÄúA torrent is approaching, Sheriff Grady,‚Äù the untouched cassette recorder played, making us jump. ‚ÄúThe depths are rising, and not even Noah‚Äôs vessel would endure what has awakened.‚Äù

‚ÄúChrist,‚Äù I hissed, feeling my heart pounding and what little hair I had left standing on end. I smashed the stop button angrily. ‚ÄúPiece of junk.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs all well, Sheriff Grady?‚Äù the doctor called through the wall. I looked at the TV and saw that he was smiling ear-to-ear.

‚ÄúBastard,‚Äù I growled. I stood and popped my back before picking up the recorder and Colt 1911. ‚ÄúWell, if this storm is as bad as you say, I might as well get the rest of the interrogation done.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave it for the staties, Grady.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe quicker the damn doctor confesses, the quicker he can see the chair,‚Äù I told him, holstering the pistol in my side sling. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anywhere else to be, but you go home to Kris and the boys.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave you here alone with him? Not a chance,‚Äù Henry scoffed. ‚ÄúBesides, her mother is there to help with the twins. Kris won‚Äôt be alone.‚Äù

I nodded, happy that I wouldn‚Äôt be solo for this even if I was too hard headed to admit it to Henry. The idea of it just being the doctor and me was terrifying. If I‚Äôm being honest, that was one reason I had stopped the interview short earlier. Even having Henry only a flight of stairs away was too far when I had to sit across from a demon wearing a muddied, bloodied suit.

Taking a deep breath, I grabbed the file and returned to my seat across from the doctor. After flipping the cassette in the recorder and clicking in two buttons, I looked up at the doctor. He was smirking at me.

I wanted to hit him. Hard.

Leaning forward, I enunciated clearly, ‚ÄúJune 13th, 6:52 p.m. Continuing interview of Dr. Emmanuel Judah Christiansen.‚Äù With the preamble out of the way, I sat back and sighed. ‚ÄúWhere were we?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you well, Tom?‚Äù

‚ÄúSheriff,‚Äù I snapped like a whip. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Sheriff Grady to you, Christiansen.‚Äù

The doctor sucked on his teeth before giving a deep chuckle. Predatory. He was the cat. I the mouse. Watching me with those hungry eyes, the doctor tapped on the table with long, thin fingers. They were the fingers of a city boy, clean and pristine, that had never seen an ounce of hard, manual work.

Until today. Until the butchery of the Johnson boy.

I was sick to my stomach and avoided looking at the closed file now on the table.

‚ÄúI apologize, Sheriff Grady,‚Äù the doctor said with a surprising amount of warmth. ‚ÄúI was under the mistaken perception that we were on a first name basis after all the conversations we had after your lovely wife‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúStay on topic, doctor,‚Äù I snapped at the bastard shrink. ‚ÄúYou already admitted to killing the Johnson boy-‚Äù

‚ÄúDenying it would have been futile given the blood on my hands.‚Äù

‚Äú-his parents, and three others who tried to detain you. So, now I just need to know why,‚Äù I finished, ignoring his interruption.

‚ÄúWhy.‚Äù Christiansen nodded as he said the word. A look of deep thought gave him the appearance of serenity, which I admit shook me more than I‚Äôd have liked. The monster felt no remorse for what he did.

‚ÄúYes, *why*?‚Äù I repeated. I swallowed the bile building in the back of my throat. ‚Äú*Why* did you take Ryan Johnson, a boy of twelve, and impale him with a meat hook? *Why* did you wrap his intestines around his throat like a noose? *Why* did you fill his stomach with sea salt and brine? *Why* cut out his tongue? His eyes? *Why* carve that symbol into his forehead? *Why* is a demon like you alive and that little boy lies on the slab next to his parents? Why?‚Äù

My voice had been rising till it had turned into a deep roar, and it wasn‚Äôt until the last word that it had returned to a normal level. That was a lie.¬† In truth, my tone was no longer a battle cry for justice. Instead, it was a whimper of hopeless desolation.

I felt sweat dripping down my forehead and neck. Realizing I was standing, I took a deep breath and sat back into my chair. In the commotion, I failed to notice that the doctor held something in his long, slender fingers.

How?

Looking quickly at the closed file, I found it open and the crime scene polaroid of the body no longer hidden behind witness statements. I looked back at the monster across the table from me. How had he done that?

Impossible as it was given the only water within two hundred miles was the lake, I was in that moment overwhelmed by the smell of seawater.

He was humming a haunting tune as his dark eyes searched the photo like it held a hidden truth. Maybe it did. I wondered if the question of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù would be answered if he found it.

‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù the doctor said slowly before looking up to meet my eyes.

There was a moment where I felt the leviathan presence ready to drag me down and then‚Ä¶it was gone.

In a brief flash, the doctor‚Äôs eyes widened in alarm, tears formed in his eyes, and his chest heaved with panicked breaths. ‚ÄúWhy is this happening to me?!‚Äù

I slid back my chair from the table as the doctor lunged to his feet. Luckily, his chains that were linked to the iron loop drilled into the floor did their job, and he fell back into his chair hard enough to upset it. The doctor went sprawling on the ground in a whimpering mess as blood dripped onto the hardwood from where the cuffs had tore skin.

‚ÄúChrist damn, shit damn bastard!‚Äù I said as I fumbled the Colt from its holster, leveling it with shaking hands.

‚ÄúHelp me, Tom,‚Äù he cried from where he lay. The doctor‚Äôs bloodied fingers crinkled the picture, and he began smashing his forehead into the floor. Whack, whack, whack.

‚ÄúJesus, Grady!‚Äù Henry said, shouldering me as he rushed from the door to the doctor. ‚ÄúHelp me before he kills himself!‚Äù

I dropped the pistol onto the table and darted forward, grabbing the doctor‚Äôs other arm and yanking his torso back to keep him from concussing himself further. Henry growled and had to readjust his grip from the slippery blood dripping down the doctor‚Äôs arms. At the same time, I hooked one arm under the doctor‚Äôs arm and gripped the collar of the tattered suit jacket with my other hand. Even with both of us, the doctor was able to repeat his headlong assault against the floor two more times.

‚ÄúCalm down!‚Äù

‚ÄúKill me!‚Äù the doctor cried, spitting teeth and slop from his bloody mouth. ‚ÄúKill me before *he* takes me again!‚Äù

Darkness.

The lights in the rooms flicked off completely. The air conditioning unit circulating the stale salty atmosphere through the vents had gone quiet, and I heard the blaring of the tornado sirens echoing through our small town. A moment later, the emergency lights kicked on as the generator in the morgue below took over.

Bathed in the yellow glow, the doctor went limp in our hands, his bloodied fingers still clutching the crumpled photo. Henry and I barely had time to catch our breath before the stench hit - wet sand, rotting wood, the stink of something dredged from the deep.

There was a sound of static before the radio in the kitchen cut on with the broadcast warning: ‚Äú-baffling as it is, a cyclone seems to be forming overhead. Scientists are at a loss but warn residents that the high winds and flooding-‚Äù

Then came a *snap***.**

The doctor was motionless except for his hands, which were contorting into every shape imaginable. There was a sickening, wet crunch as one hand slithered free from the cuff, skin peeling, bones crushed to a bag of meat and broken bone. The other pulled against its shackle, tearing flesh down to the gleaming white beneath.

Heavy wind hissed through spaces in the attic like a death whistle, and a loud growl of thunder or something worse shook the building.

The doctor moved.

Defying all logic, he was able to launch from our grasps, striking and destroying a leg of the table like a matchstick. It collapsed on top of him with the paperwork detailing his heinous acts scattering around the room.

His face concealed from our view by the wooden tabletop, the doctor seemed to collect himself. When he spoke again, the previous emotion had been replaced by an incredibly cold pressure.

‚ÄúWhy, you ask, Sheriff Grady,‚Äù he chuckled from beneath the table debris. ‚ÄúThe answer to your ‚Äòwhy‚Äô is twofold. First, happenstance and fortune delivered anguished Ryan to my door while necessity and devotion carved him with the knife.‚Äù

I reached for my colt but found the holster empty. ‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù

In the emergency light, the doctor‚Äôs body twisted unnaturally. His legs flopped uselessly, as if the bones inside no longer obeyed him. His torso corkscrewed and snapped, leaving his waist to be the divide between where his back stopped and his groin began.

I gulped in horror as his bone-pulped hand flopped against the side of the tabletop more liquid than solid, but still gripping, still pulling. Pieces of white poked through the skin, leaving tiny faucets of blood across its surface.

Despite the ruined hand, he still managed to drag himself forward.

‚ÄúHoly hell!‚Äù Henry gasped, staggering backwards until his back slammed against the wall.

‚ÄúThe second reason why‚Ä¶their screams were a symphony to me.‚Äù

The voice was different now - richer, layered, with something old echoing beneath it. The doctor‚Äôs eyes glinted as he pulled himself further into the light, his lips peeling back in a grin.

‚ÄúSteel yourself, Sheriff. You prodded the abyss.‚Äù His voice dropped to a whisper. ‚ÄúAnd here‚Ä¶ here there be monsters.‚Äù

The doctor let out a sharp, barking cackle that made my body go cold and my jaw lock. I was up in an instant and Henry was right behind me, pushing down against me to get farther ahead in his flight.

On all fours, like a dog, I scrambled toward the door. A bullet pierced the wall directly above me, but my mad dash allowed me to escape into the hallway beyond. As soon as I got to the other side, Henry slammed the door shut and threw the locks closed.

Another shot was followed by the doctor‚Äôs maniac cackle; but the laugh was much more damaging to us than the bullet since it only embedded itself into the thick oaken door. As for me, I pushed myself to my feet and rushed toward the front door. Throwing it open, I was met with an insurmountable torrent of wind and rain.

The hurricane was on our doorstep with all of its fury. The rain hit like needles and the wind lifted me off my feet. The flood lights shown with all their might against the oppressive darkness, and I could just barely make out my Ford and Henry‚Äôs Corolla at the edge of it, but both vehicles went rolling as a powerful gust drove through.

With my heart in my boots, I put all my weight behind the door and closed it. The sound of the storm muffled somewhat but that just made it easier to hear the doctor singing a shanty in the room deeper in the battered house.



*‚ÄúOh, the black tide swells and the dead men call,*

*Through waters cursed where no stars fall.*

*A shadow stirs in the fathoms deep,*

*Where lost souls wail and the drowned ones creep.‚Äù*



The doctor let out a gravelly laugh that gnawed away at my soul. Taking a deep breath, I walked slowly down the dark hallway toward the light coming from the kitchen. Each step seemed to drive my stomach deeper into my chest but better to be in the light‚Ä¶or that‚Äôs what I told myself.

Henry was sitting at the table with his head between his hands. Hearing me approach, the younger man looked up at me with the same panic that was undoubtedly plain on my own face. I took the seat across from him even as we both still heard the doctor singing in the next room.



*‚ÄúA thousand arms, all slick with grime,*

*They grasp and pull beyond all time,*

*No prayers nor steel can cut them free,*

*Once ye‚Äôre caught, ye cease to be!‚Äù*



That is when I saw the doctor‚Äôs finger snake through the bullet hole and begin chipping away at the drywall.

The monster was coming, and it sang:



*‚ÄúSome are torn and ground to meat,*

*Some are swallowed, whole and sweet,*

1nvqun7,https://www.reddit.com/r/JoanMarketing/comments/1nvqun7/amazon_echo_show_11_newest_model/,Amazon Echo Show 11 (newest model),"You want a smart display that actually *earns* a spot on your counter, right? Same. I set up the **Amazon Echo Show 11** last week, and I kept finding excuses to use it‚Äîtimers, recipes, doorbell alerts, even quick video calls while I burned my eggs (again). It packs helpful brains with a bigger, brighter canvas. Ready to see why this newest model hits different?

üëâ [**Check current price on Amazon**](https://amzn.to/4mNv4R3)

# Big-screen design that actually fits

The **11-inch display** gives you room to read recipes without squinting and swipe through widgets without juggling screens. I park it near the coffee machine, and the angle keeps glare in check. The bezels shrink, the footprint stays counter-friendly, and the ambient light sensor adjusts brightness so your eyes don‚Äôt revolt at 6 a.m. Nice.

# Quick specs that matter

* **11"" HD touch display** with sharp text and vibrant photos
* **Upgraded speakers** for fuller bass and clearer voices
* **Adaptive brightness** and **far-field mics** that hear you from across the room
* **Wi-Fi 6** support for snappier streams and calls

# Sound that doesn‚Äôt feel like a tablet

I care about audio more than I should (IMO), and this **Echo Show 11** pushes richer low end without muddy vocals. Podcasts sound warm, kitchen playlists feel lively, and Alexa‚Äôs voice sits clean in the mix. Want more oomph? Pair a sub or a second speaker and widen the stage. Who says counter speakers need to sound thin?

# What I noticed in daily use

* **Music**: Stronger bass at low volume, no harsh highs.
* **Calls**: Voices cut through noise better than older Shows.
* **TV clips**: Dialogue stays intelligible, even while frying onions. :)

# Smart home control that feels‚Ä¶ actually smart

Ever wish your lights, cams, and robot vacs just listened? This **newest model** ties your **smart home dashboard** into one glanceable screen. I pin my favorites‚Äîkitchen lights, doorbell, thermostat‚Äîand tap once to act. Alexa routines handle the boring stuff: lights on at sunset, vacuum after breakfast, goodnight scene at 11. FYI, the widget grid makes quick actions painless.

# Why it beats your phone

* **Always-on glanceability** beats pocket-fishing.
* **Tap + voice** gives you two fast paths for the same task.
* **Live Picture-in-Picture** shows cams while timers run. Multitask win.

# Camera, privacy, and family tricks

The **13 MP camera** keeps video calls sharp and auto-frames so you don‚Äôt drift off-screen while chopping veggies. I flip the **physical shutter** when I want privacy, and I mute mics with one tap. You want kid-friendly? Set **visual timers**, **sticky notes**, and **photo slideshows** that pull from your family album. Ever wondered why your fridge door suddenly attracts everyone? Because photos + weather + reminders live here now.

# Privacy comforts

* **Hardware shutter** and **mic mute**
* **On-device controls** you can see at a glance
* **Per-feature permissions** you manage in the app

# Echo Show 11 vs. older Echo Show models

I owned a smaller Show, and I kept squinting at recipes and pausing videos to read steps. The **Echo Show 11** fixes that. It runs smoother, sounds bigger, and gives my widgets real space. If you live on counters or desks, this hits the sweet spot. If you want a wall-sized screen, that‚Äôs a different league (and a different budget, lol).

# When the Echo Show 11 makes sense

* You want a **true hub** for lights, cams, timers, and routines.
* You value **better speakers** in a compact footprint.
* You like **hands-free recipes**, **glanceable widgets**, and **sharp calls**.

# Final take

I call the **Amazon Echo Show 11 (newest model)** the ‚Äúkitchen captain‚Äù because it quietly runs the shift while you live your life. It shows what matters, sounds legit, and controls the house without fuss. If you want one smart display that does the most with the least effort, this one earns the counter space‚Äîno contest. Ready to try it and see if it sticks? IMO, it will. :/",1,1759369135.0,JoanMarketing,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve got a completely free day and evening this Friday and thought it‚Äôd be fun to find someone to hang out with. Open to pretty much anything. I was thinking something along the lines of:

‚Ä¢ Grabbing some rush tickets and catching a show
‚Ä¢ Making use of my ArtFund / Barbican / Nudge membership
‚Ä¢ Watching a film at BFI
‚Ä¢ Taking a walk and chatting or a boat trip
‚Ä¢ Eating something delicious
‚Ä¢ Maybe even find a gig on Resident Advisor

A little about me:

‚Ä¢ Millennial, work in tech-for-good
‚Ä¢ I like both nice things and dirt-cheap things ‚Äì best nights are the ones that mix both (think rooftop/members clubs ‚Üí random warehouse party)

Interests: music, film, food, card/video/board games, philosophy, spontaneous encounters, raves (once upon a time), Milan Kundera, Russian literature, coffee & other stimulants, and making Spotify playlists.

Ideally looking for another millennial (or even a cool Gen Z) who‚Äôs up for a spontaneous day out. I‚Äôm an East Asian F.

If this sounds fun, drop me a message‚Ä¶tell me a bit about yourself, what you‚Äôre into, and just for fun: if money was no object, what work would you choose to do?

1nvqsk4,https://i.redd.it/ksvu81fiplsf1.jpeg,Manifested an expensive pokemon plushie and a great day!,"I took a picture with my backpack to show how big my new plushie is. :)

Since I decided to take manifesting seriously a week or two ago (and my life much less seriously), really good things have been happening to me. Like I have been wanting more friends, people that I can get very close to and talk about anything. Including the topic of manifesting which I am very passionate about. 

Last week, I bumped into an old coworker. We had a blast hanging out and she bought me coffee.

We hung out again today and we had an absolute blast!!!! Also, I realised I did a very fun manifestation.

I think it was a few months ago when I wanted to manifest a really cool pokemon plushie for free. And I wanted a really cool one. I think I originally really wanted a sleeping eevee-lution, but I became open to just one I love.

At first it felt stupid and impossible. But I persisted whenever I thought of it. I remember just recently a few days ago remember my desire, and I knew I would get it. 

Today I had a wonderful day hanging out with my new friend. We saw a Gamestop and walked in just to look. Zero intention to buy anything. But I looked at the little backpacks and big plushies and I couldn't resist asking! But when he told me how expensive they were, I would decide against it fast lol.

Well my new friend offered to buy me one because she loves me so much!!! She said she never does it for anyone but she will do it for me!

I fell in-love with a dragonite plushie priced at $60 and so that's what I got! Well she gave me $40, then when I put my phone number into the register, it went down to $46!

 So I only paid $6 for it.

And at first it was going to be one of the sleeping evee-lution plushies that were priced at $40!!! In fact seeing them is what made my friend feel the compulsion to buy me whatever I wanted. I just fell in love with a dragonite and I was willing to put the extra $20 into it!

 I think she would've paid for the whole thing if I offered, but I felt like I should because it was so much more expensive than the plushies I was looking at originally.

I am so greatful to my god which is my imagination, Jesus which represents the traits of manifestation, my friend, and my lovely new plushie that I love so much! We named him Muttsy haha.

It's funny because I am 35 and she is in her 60's but I always forget because she is extremely healthy and young looking. She looks and acts my age. And what's awesome is despite our ages, we both love cute plushies, even if she doesn't know what Pok√©mon is haha. She loves my dragonite too and came up with the name. 

Oh and she loves listening to my crazy manifesting stories! She says she gets goosebumps haha. It's crazy how open minded she is because she had never heard of such a thing before.

Today was the funnest day I've had in a while and since assuming my days would be fun and good things would happen to me, it seems to be coming true!

The betting market is as split as a hot dog at a vegan potluck. Colorado sits at **-115** to **-120**, while Vegas hovers between **-115** and **-120**, depending on the bookie. Converting to implied probabilities, both teams check in around **51-52%**, suggesting this is a toss-up. The spread favors Colorado (-1.5) at sharp odds (1.30-1.43), but the total goals line (4.5) leans toward the **Under** at 2.05-2.20. Why?

You know, my phone's battery life had gotten so bad, it felt like I was carrying a digital pet that needed constant feeding. I'd be out for a coffee and suddenly be tethered to the wall like a dog on a leash, watching the percentage drop just from checking the time. It was that frustrating feeling of your entire day‚Äîmaps, tickets, messages‚Äîbeing held hostage by a dying battery.



I started looking into it, and it turns out most smartphone batteries are designed to last. The real curiosity that stuck with me is that their lifespan is measured in ""charge cycles,"" not years. A typical battery is engineered to retain up to 80% of its original capacity after about 500 complete cycles, which for most people is roughly two years of daily use. After that, the decline becomes much more noticeable, just like mine did.



That's why I've been paying closer attention to the specs on new models, like the rumors for the iPhone 17. The talk is they're focusing heavily on both battery longevity and much faster charging. It seems like the solution isn't just a bigger battery, but one that's smarter and more resilient to the wear and tear of daily life.



It‚Äôs a small thing, but not having that low-battery anxiety humming in the background has been a genuine relief. It feels less like managing a fragile resource and more like just using a tool. I never thought I'd feel so liberated by something as simple as not having to hunt for an outlet all the time.

But I'm also in need of social interactions.

Last year, I thought I was happy. Even though I had lost my job, I had a really close friend in who I thought I could confide, I was doing a lot of volunteering work and that helped me meet with a lot of people, mostly Muslims or people with similar values. 

I was also talking to someone, someone I met through volunteering, and thought maybe it was going somewhere. We met several times with our common social group and we also went out for coffee just the two of us once.

A few month ago, I had a really bad fall out with my friend. We were working together alongside two other women on a project, a nonprofit organization to help our community. All of it was volunteering work, not paid, and I was the only one in the group who didn't have a job on the side so even if I felt really useful and fulfilled by all the projects we had, I was still a little bit insecure.

That friend, decided to go behind my back and badmouth me to our colleagues instead of directly coming to me to discuss her issues with me within the organization. I truly felt hurt and betrayed but it also opened my eyes on how she treated me even outside of the organization. To be honest, I had already opened my eyes on some of her flaws before that and was starting to slowing put distance between us. She wasn't a good friend to begging with and I realized she was only happy to use me for her own interests, never helping me when I needed her and, in a way, putting me down too. We work together on most of our projects and she had a habit of taking credit for things she didn't do. I didn't mind when I thought we were a team, plus I hate being the center of attention, but it started to bother me when I saw it as a another way of putting me down. In a lot of ways, I felt more like her assistant than her equal. 

I started losing sleep over this and after a lot of thinking, I decided to resign from my position. Told them I wanted to focus on me and getting a job, as an excuse. To this day, I haven't told my real reason to any of them. What upset me even more is, when I had this conversation with them, my ""friend"" said she was not surprised and knew I would resign sooner or later. I was too mad to ask her what she meant by that, I only wanted to end the conversation and never have to face her again. I am still in contact with all of them though because I couldn't just abandon all our project, I just have a less important role in it, less responsibilities, and less time with the ex-friend.

Because of this, I've started to isolate myself again, doing less volunteering, going out less.

I also haven't seen the brother I was talking to because we use to go all together to gatherings. I only saw him a couple of times because we've recently joined the same organization but will be working on different projects. I also stopped texting him because I was starting to feel like I was doing something wrong. I like the guy and I'm interested in marriage but I don't want to make the first move because the first and last time I did, I ended up getting emotionally hurt. 

I don't know what is the right way to go about it. I also feel like I only want to get married now for the wrong reasons and so I try to stop myself from having these feelings.

I don't know what kind of advice I'm looking for here, if any. I just need to get it out of my chest. I can't talk to my family right now because they all have their own things going on, and I don't have any close friend at the moment.

I just feel so lonely and I can't operate like a normal healthy human being.

(Also wanted to add I've been struggling with depression for a few years now, under medication, I see a doctor but no therapist. It's just hard to find a good one that won't judge you for your religious lifestyle)",6,1759368459.0,MuslimCorner,1,0.88,False

Franklin Ave, under construction since I can't remember anymore, looks like it's ready to be paved.  I think it's possible to drive across it now.

I am from Germany and I enjoy some coffee mostly in the morning. 

I‚Äôve been drinking the latte Cube Mega coffee (the one with 2 iced esspreso shaped beans on top of it). Had enjoy it for 3 days in a row until my girlfriend had a taste and told me it‚Äôs sweet. 

This was kind of a shock to me, I try to avoid sugar drinks as much as possible and having coffee black and only with milk sometimes. 

The Order Menu doesn‚Äôt list it as an ingredient and I would have assumed coffee latte is just coffee with milk. I feel violated if you don‚Äôt get that information beforehand. Sticking to iced americano for now until I get some clarity

 So since I haven‚Äôt been able to ask this directly to the workers of mega coffee (might also be rude) I‚Äôm asking Reddit.

I‚Äôm trying to keep myself accountable to this diet and I thought others might be interested in hearing what this diet is like/how it helps.
Personally, I am doing this diet in hopes of lowering my level of inflammation and increasing my chances of conceiving. Alongside this diet, I am also trying to calm my nervous system and bring down my stress levels- you might see some of that in my daily updates.

I was diagnosed with endometriosis about 16 months ago, but I‚Äôve had painful periods since I was 13. I am struggling with primary infertility and my doctor said ‚Äúthere is no visible reason why you couldn‚Äôt get pregnant.‚Äù That lead me to the idea that trying to lower my inflammation might help this process. Which led me to the Auto Immune Protocol Diet. I am also hoping this will help some of the pain I experience, so I‚Äôll let you know how that goes. I‚Äôll update each day in the comments of this post in case that is helpful info for anybody! If it isn‚Äôt, thanks for helping me hold myself accountable ‚ô•Ô∏è 

Day 1 of 46(Elimination Phase):

Stats for today:
End of Day weight: 235.7 lbs
Breakfast: None:(
Lunch: Mediterranean Tuna Salad and Carrots
Dinner: Ginger Turkey and Cucumber bowl with cauliflower rice
Additional foods or beverages: Ginger Tea(v bitter), Chamomile tea, and a spindrift sparkling water!!


Calling today a success because I didn‚Äôt eat anything ‚Äúoff-limits.‚Äù Overall, the day was much more manageable than I expected. I thought cutting out coffee and sugar would cause more headaches and brain fog.
I had meal prepped my lunch that morning and bought appropriate stuff for dinner the night before. I have lower back pain and hip pain that I think is tied to the endo. It has been bad this week, but I think that could be cuz I was trying to get all my coffee in while I could.

Areas for growth: I need to pack more stuff for work. Since it‚Äôs all fresh food, I was nervous about bringing it all into the shared fridge. But I‚Äôm feeling more comfortable doing that now.
I also need to meal prep something I can eat for breakfast. I was very hungry before lunch.

Things done to lower stress levels: 
- ate lunch outside in the sunshine
- switched up the lighting in my office to lamps, so it‚Äôs less aggressive

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all.

**Tips & Preparation**

Recipe Background:

* Traditional cold brew is wasteful due to high coffee-to-water ratios and incomplete extraction.
* Aim is to achieve better value for money from the coffee.
* Address the oxidized taste that develops in older cold brews.
* Maximize flavor extraction even with cold water.

Preparations:

* Grind: close to Moka pot or fine side of AeroPress
* Use relatively soft water, low in buffer, room temperature
* Carbon filter the water if necessary.
* Fining agent (vegan preferred) is used to clarify the cold brew. Use 1 drops per 100ml.

Variations/Adjustments:

* Experiment with different roast levels and coffee types to find preferred cold brew profiles.
* Light roasts may not be ideal for cold brew; darker roasts and natural processed coffees can yield surprisingly good results.
* Adjust fining agent quantity based on batch size (10 drops per liter).
* Consider water chemistry, though it has less impact than with hot brewing methods.

  
Recipe Steps

* Add 75g of finely ground coffee to a vessel.
* Add 1 liter of room temperature water.
* Stir the mixture use a spoon.Add 10 drops of fining agent, Mix in the fining agent.

I truly don't even know where to start with this, I could write a book on how badly this caterer fucked up. Sorry, this is gonna be pretty long, I wish there wasn't so much to document. Before I start yappin too much, congratulations to Morgan and Justin on getting married!! Everything looked incredible, and we (26F + 27F, lets go lesbians!) actually got married on the same day! I hope your weather was as good as ours in New England. Okay, onto the story.

I know every wedding day has hiccups, but I stupidly thought we saw the worst of it when we had to switch photographers the day before our wedding. Our florists were amazing, the photographer was so sweet to us, the day was going great until our caterer decided it was time to ruin the day we spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on.

This caterer was supposed to be a cute small business run by women with a little silver vintage RV that they tow to different events with tables, dishes, food, etc. We were extremely confused when the ""caterers"" showed up, and there was no RV, and two dudes in their early 20s jumped out of a car that was littered with energy drinks. I don't mean a few cans like they opened their doors and cans came spilling out onto the ground. To give some context for our wedding, we booked a farmhouse Airbnb with a barn for the event space. We assumed most of the food was already prepared and just needed to be finished off in whatever appliances they had in the RV, but we were a bit confused when the staff members started bringing stuff into the Airbnb to use the ovens and stoves. Not a huge deal, but a bit off-putting when my dad asked about the RV because we reserved a place for it to be parked by the barn, and they said it wasn't coming.¬†

Like many couples in 2025, my wife and I are pretty broke, so we couldn't splurge on much for our wedding, but we decided the one thing we would do it on is food. My beautiful wife is a professional chef; she has a degree in baking and pastry arts and a degree in restaurant management. Needless to say, the food was one of the most important parts of the day for her. She worked on this menu for weeks; it was a combination of dishes they offered and dishes she came up with (they allowed custom dishes). She would talk about this incredible menu to anyone who would listen and was just anxiously waiting to try it all. Pumpkin Ricotta Ravioli with a brown butter sage sauce, Saffron and Garlic Basmati Rice, and a Fingerling Potato / Squash Medley were just some of the items on our menu.

This company sold their services as a cute, luxury experience created and run by chefs. It rated extremely well on Google reviews, and after many phone calls and meetings discussing what we were looking for, we trusted wholeheartedly that they could deliver what they promised. Boy we were wrong.

The two boys who honestly looked like they were shitting their pants the entire time started setting up and making appetizers. I'm gonna try not to rag on them too hard because the real villain of this story is the owner, M. These two were trying their best to save what they could but they soon accepted they were missing many ingredients and what they did have wasn't enough for 40 guests. So they had to make a last-minute run to the store to grab the many, many missing drink and food ingredients. We also hired the company to bartend, and were told if we provided the liquor, they would provide the tools and mixers. They showed up with no mixers, but they did have a bartender, and he was amazing.¬†

Now, because my wife is a chef, she has many experts in the culinary field at our wedding, some of whom actually do catering and know how a business like this should operate and the amounts of food that should be present for a 40-person event. After the ceremony, which thank god went beautifully, those professionals stepped into the kitchen to see how it was going since the two dudes seemed stressed as all hell before the ceremony. The two were scrambling to get the food prepared as fast as humanely possible, which meant they couldn't pass out appetizers (another service we were offered that was not provided). So the friends offered to work a bit and pass them out, but asked where the rest was. There was no rest, this is all of the appetizers, which were enough for maybe 15 people, not 40. Our beautiful, amazing, talented friends then split into two groups: one preps and passes out food to the guests, the other pulls what they can from the Airbnb fridge and pantry to make enough food to fill the gaps left wide open by this god awful caterer from hell. My now wife and I were a bit confused when our friend walked into our getting-ready room, passing out appetizers instead of one of the staff, and she very gently let us know that we're having some issues with the caterer. Fuck. She wanted to spare us the details so we could get back outside as fast as possible to get family portraits before joining our guests for the cocktail hour. Unfortunately, that's not how my wife works, and she needed details now so she can help solve this problem. Despite multiple friends refusing to fill her in so as not to upset her, one finally did when they realized she's more stressed not knowing than knowing.

The caterer then broke the #1 rule, DON'T. MAKE. THE BRIDES. CRY. They were missing TWO ENTREES, many appetizers + sides, and what they do have is wrong. The vintage RV never showed up, there are only two staff members, they're way behind schedule, and the food is cold and incorrect. They didn't have enough food for everyone, and now our friends, who should have the day off from culinary work and be enjoying the reception, have their aprons on and are trying to save this wedding. My poor wife started sobbing and fighting off a panic attack. We were just elated and excited to see everyone who traveled so far and look happy for pictures, and now we're watching the caterers who were supposed to feed our guests absolutely nose-dive. I'm sitting on the ground next to her, trying to calm her down and assure her it was going to work out. We see make-shift appetizers being rushed out for the cocktail hour. We tried the appetizers that the caterer was in charge of, and one of the main ingredients was wrong; it was freezing cold and not grilled like it was supposed to be.¬†

My wife, I, our Best Bitch (like a Maid of Honor, but we didn't technically have a wedding party), and my mom were in the getting-ready room trying to figure out what to do. My mom called the owner of the company (the lady we had all of our calls with) to ask what the hell was going on. ""M"" answered, my mom explained the situation, and this lady couldn't care less. She said she ""didn't see what the problem was, not ALL of the food is out, so you don't know for sure yet that it's not enough."" My mom said the two staff members in the kitchen seemed like they were absolutely lost and overwhelmed. M says, ""Well, they're not really my employees, they don't totally know what they're doing..."" I shit you not. She said that. To my mother. On her daughter's wedding day. My mom's mood immediately switched. ""I'm sorry, we spent THOUSANDS on this food and your employees don't know what they're doing??? Why would you send them? You talk about being a chef, why aren't YOU here to help if you knew there were issues before they even left for the event?"" We left the room because it was overwhelming to listen to this shitty owner talk in a bored voice while trying to process everything going on. Also, at this point, we were 30 minutes late for photos, and the sun was about to go down. In case you're curious how that phone call went, M never apologized and hung up on my mom mid-sentence.

We walk into the kitchen, and my wife is in Gordan Ramsey mode now. She asked the two boys what was missing. They listed the ingredients and said, ""M knew we were short on everything, but she sent us anyway!"" We filled them in on what we heard of the phone call with her, and man, the way they stopped and looked at each other. You could tell this wasn't the first time this has happened.

Fast-forward a bit, and there are more guests in the kitchen, trying to get dinner ready, and my wife and I are getting pictures taken. I'm trying to keep this as short as possible, but I also wanted to mention that after finally collecting myself for photos, I took one step outside and my mom accidentally stepped on the back of my dress and ripped about a foot of the lace trim. My sweet seamstress friend ran me back inside to quickly fix my dress, and that's when I started crying, too. We decided to just cut the rest of the trim off so I can get photos before the sun is entirely down.

After photos, we sat for dinner, our best bitch gave a short speech thanking all of the guests who stepped up to make and serve dinner (and order extra food from a local pizza place, which was $240 and extra ingredients for the dinner and drinks $150), and we went to make our plates. The food our friends made and bought was amazing; the food the caterers prepared was an absolute embarrassment. What was supposed to be the Fingerling Potato / Squash Medley was instant mashed potatoes (our friends saw the two boxes they bought on their grocery store run), the ravioli which was our only vegetarian option for our five vegetatian friends was replaced by a quick pesto pasta our friends made out of various ingredients they found (again, the caterer just didn't bring this), the tandori chicken was not a yummy red color, but dry, tanish-gray baked chicken piled onto a plate (picture attached), what was supposed to be brown sugar glazed ham was a grocery store ham still on the bone fresh from its little bag and served in a hotel pan (picture attached), and the safron + garlic rice was plain, white rice). There was more, but I'll stop there.

Later in the night, there was supposed to be a coffee service. A ""gorgeous display with a variety of sugars, creamers (dairy & non-dairy), hot or iced coffee, and real mugs & glasses."" How about a single, empty coffee carafe on one of our tables, and our friends had to brew pots of coffee to fill it up, take the creamers and sugars from the Airbnb, plus mismatched mugs and to-go cups from the cabinets (picture attached). We also paid them for a water service which boasted ""Fruit & herb infused water for guests. Includes gorgeous display and disposable cups. For up to four (4) hours."" Yeah, not a single one of those things was there. We filled up one of our water containers and put it out for guests. I don't even know what we did for glasses.¬†

By the end of the night, we were doing everything we could to salvage this day in our memories, but I could never have expected one piece going wrong to have such a massive ripple effect of chaos. As my dad put it so well in a section of the email sent to them this morning:

""This was an absolutely disastrous meal.¬† While we are appreciative that you did initiate a refund of our second payment to your group, due to the absolutely disastrous nature of this event, **we are asking you for a full refund, as you did not honor your agreement and provide the food and beverage services you agreed to.** ¬†Even then, it will never make up for the fact that you effectively ruined a once-in-a-lifetime wedding event for our daughter. ¬† It was not as if a few things were wrong -- everything was wrong, missing, and late. ¬† You provided a staff that was unprepared to produce this meal, and did not equip them with the food, ingredients, dishes, and supplies necessary. ¬† Your company made our guests have to prepare food, carry food, brew coffee, scrounge for spices, gather up cups, make appetizers, cook a vegetarian pasta, find utensils and dishes, and I could go on. ¬† We missed time at our reception, as did the brides and wedding party members, trying to resolve this event.""¬†

She still hasn't responded, hasn't called, and most importantly, hasn't apologized. She gave us a partial refund on the services that weren't provided on the day after the wedding, and now I think she's trying to ghost us. I'll update if/when she responds.

I now truly understand why couples go on a relaxing honeymoon right after the wedding. My wife sobbed for at least an hour when we got home about how embarrassing the catered food was for a wedding. How stressful the day we prepared so long for was, and how much time was taken away from guests we only see every few years. We couldn't afford a honeymoon right after, so I'm writing this after work because we had to jump back into the work week as soon as we got home. We have a little honeymoon fund that our guests have been adding a bit to, which, on top of everything else they've already done for us, is just ridiculously sweet. I have never felt so loved. I can't believe the lengths these people have gone for us, and at the end of the day, I am just so grateful I get to have these incredible folks in my life. I love them and I love my fucking wife!!!! Thank you for reading <3

Prev dx PVCs, arrhythmia nos, tachycardia, elevated BP (suspected hypertension but not confirmed)
No medications aside from levocetirizine as needed, but take vitamins (d, b complex with c)
Occasional cannabis use for sleep (getsnoozy gummies).

Relatively sedentary outside of work (hairstylist).

Backstory:
(I have occasional episodes of PVCs, sometimes it‚Äôs a short little blip on the day, sometimes I‚Äôm only in sinus rhythm 4 hours out of the day, sometimes I‚Äôm throwing PVCs for days. 
Haven‚Äôt had echo/holter done yet, because I‚Äôm waiting for open enrollment for insurance. I don‚Äôt qualify for Medicaid. 
A family member who was a nurse for 20yrs+ recommended I pick up the KardiaMobile 6 lead to track episodes.)

I‚Äôve been in an ‚Äúepisode‚Äù since yesterday, maybe been in normal sinus for one hour. Went into afib twice for a few mins each, had two readings where the ekg was so abnormal that it said ‚Äúunknown‚Äù.

Not a particularly stressful day, slept okay, not really anxious outside of the weird readings, maybe 14-16oz of coffee, well fed, hydrated. Unfortunately had a little chest pain, shortness of breath, light headed multiple times today. I KNOW most times it‚Äôs recommended to hit the ER. But last time I went for the same symptoms, they said ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably benign, here‚Äôs a referral‚Äù after ruling out a cardiac event/ruling out impending event. 

When I have multi day episodes I tend to get dizziness/dyspnea/chest discomfort.

Typically standing up is the worst, but it‚Äôs tolerable when I sit or lay down. (Side note, been suspecting POTs after last ER visit one month ago. Normal resting HR is anywhere from 56-65 at rest, and 64-78 while sitting up. Standing tends to be 93-146. If I get too active immediately after standing it can get much higher.)

Anyway, back on track. Should I be worried about the afib/unknown readings? Not a stranger to the PVCs, that‚Äôs just kind of life now. Haven‚Äôt really had the chest pain/SOB when at rest, mostly when standing/moving around, immediately after getting up. If I‚Äôm not having a dizzy spell and remain upright, the chest discomfort and SOB tends to subside within 20ish mins. 

Want to specify the chest pain is not severe, probably 1-2, maybe one spike at a 4/10 when I was heating up/eating dinner.

No stroke symptoms. No muscle weakness. (I had to be lightly bullied to go to the ER last time cuz I didn‚Äôt feel it was necessary but I‚Äôm not a professional, hence this post LOL).

1nvqbow,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nvqbow/my_boyfriend_24m_cheated_and_is_blaming_me_23f/,"My boyfriend (24M) cheated, and is blaming me (23F) for getting cancer","Hi folks! This is my first time posting, but hoping that getting this off my chest will help me a bit :)

I have been dating my boyfriend for a little less than a year. We were long distance, but did our best to make the distance feel not as far. We always tried to visit each other at least 1-2 times a month and talked about our future and marriage several times. 

He recently signed a lease to a new apartment, but didn‚Äôt have a place to stay for a bit. So I told him to come stay with me for two weeks and he agreed. Of course, I was thrilled to be able to spend time with him for so long. 

This all went down in August, and I had been rather down during that month. Had some stressful things going on and I really missed him. He works night shifts and I work during the day, so besides the good morning/night texts, we weren‚Äôt really able to talk much. More so than usual, because he worked nearly every single day to make up for being gone from work to come here. 

I knew he was busy, and I never once doubted him for anything. Not a single ounce. I fully knew he was not the kind of person to cheat or lie. Especially because he was quite strict with my relationships with other guys. So I thought the standards went both ways. 

We both like to game, but he didn‚Äôt like me playing games with my guy friends. It led to a couple of arguments and I decided to just leave the discord server I enjoyed playing in. Distanced myself from most of my friends, because I felt like he was all I really needed. It got pretty lonely after a while, leading to feeling sad a lot of the days. This made him feel guilty and stressed to see me be so sad. 

We were going to see each other soon though, so I thought all will be well. 

The day he arrived, he immediately crashed from the long flight. I laid next to him and waited for him to wake up. Got bored, and then started looking through his phone. My phone wasn‚Äôt near me, and I didn‚Äôt want to get up and risk waking him up. We both knew each other‚Äôs passwords and never minded being on each other‚Äôs phone. 

Then, I found a DM on instagram with a girl I didn‚Äôt recognize. Turns out she was a new co-worker. Looking through the texts, it wasn‚Äôt flirty or anything but apparently they went out to grab coffee before work several times and also grabbed lunch together. 

Some of you may not think that‚Äôs a big deal. And to be honest, you‚Äôre right. But here‚Äôs the thing. 

I work in a male dominated field, and my co-workers are all mainly guys. My boyfriend made it clear that he didn‚Äôt like me going out to grab lunch with them. So of course, I respected that and would choose to not go when they offered. 

It stung that he never once mentioned her to me. Even more so when she asked where he got a gift that I GAVE HIM, and his reply was ‚ÄúI got it from a friend‚Äù. 

Of course we fought, and this was when he let it slip that he got cancer. He got diagnosed early that month and felt like he didn‚Äôt want to really tell me anything due to the emotional turmoil. He also said that I was causing him so much stress. 

This broke my heart, and I said we should break up if I‚Äôm that much of a stressor to him. He agreed because he didn‚Äôt want me to suffer with him as he goes through cancer treatment and surgery. And worst case scenario, experience his death. 

He bought a plane ticket to go home, and I stayed over at a friend‚Äôs house before deciding that I needed to go back and talk to him one last time.

In the end, we ended up not breaking up. (Terrible decision, I know) 

Instead, we decided to continue dating for the remaining 2 weeks that he will be here, and THEN break up. Even talked about how in the future, fate will allow us to start over again if he beats cancer. 

One week passes, and we continued dating happily despite the sad circumstances. He even took me out shopping for cute workout sets and some expensive gifts. I felt guilty receiving them, because it felt like he was trying to spend his hard earned money on me as a goodbye gift. 

Until one day, I was at work and couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about ‚ÄúWhy would he lie about having a girlfriend to his co-worker?‚Äù Despite forgiving him, it was like‚Ä¶.a weird spider sense was talking to me, and I ended up checking his phone again that night. Nothing on instagram or messenger, so I went and opened his Discord app. Funnily enough, I didn‚Äôt even have to click on anything.  The conversation he was having with another girl immediately popped up. 

Long story short, he was cheating on me with a 32 year old discord E-girl he recently met while playing Valorant. (She also has a boyfriend btw) Never even met her in person, but he was sexting her and saying ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù all while he was at my house. 

Apparently he felt comfort spilling everything about himself to her because she was just a stranger online who knew nothing about him. He didn‚Äôt want to confide in me, his friends, or his family about his cancer. But then it evolved into ‚Äúcrossing the line‚Äù and according to him, he didn‚Äôt do all that with the intention of actually dating her, or felt love for her. 

Then came the blaming. He said that because I gave him so much stress while dating, I‚Äôm the reason why he got cancer. That I GAVE him cancer. Pretty crazy, right? 

Well, I was in a pretty bad emotional state at that point, and I believed him. He left, and I was left feeling the overwhelming guilt, anger, and hurt to deal with by myself, because he blocked me on everything afterwards. 

A month has passed since then, and enough medical professionals have assured me that his cancer cannot be something caused by me. I understand that now, but it was still a pretty traumatizing thing to hear from someone I loved. 

We did end up having a proper closure over the phone, (Once he unblocked me) and he apologized for his words. But he still continues to play games with that girl and her group of guy friends. I have mentioned several times how disrespectful that is to me, but he keeps saying that they are just friends and only play as a group now. 

I thought I could handle leaving him in my life as an acquaintance, but it hurt too much and I ended up blocking him. Before cutting all contact, I had one last call with him. He said that he still loves me and misses me. But we can‚Äôt get back together because of his cancer. He wants the best for me, and wants me to find someone who will be able to stick around in my life longer than he would be able to. 

And that‚Äôs how it ended. 

Despite being cheated on, I still miss him dearly. A part of me wants him to come back begging to get back together, but I know I shouldn‚Äôt be with him again. 

How does one get over being cheated on? Do you think he feels guilty for his actions and is crying every night like I am? Is there a chance that he may try to reach out to me in the future?

I have never loved someone so much in my life before, even more than I love myself. It‚Äôs my shortest relationship yet, but it hurts the most. I know that time will heal, but goodness sakes I feel like I‚Äôm dying guys. ",2,1759367657.0,relationship_advice,3,0.75,False

1nvq7at,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nvq7at,Rug + design suggestions for cozy apartment with parquet floors,"Hi everyone, hoping for some design advice!

I just moved into a NYC apartment with the old-school parquet flooring. It‚Äôs bright, warm-toned wood, and I actually think it has a lot of cozy potential ‚Äî but I‚Äôm struggling with how to bring the right elements together around it.

We originally bought the M1 Rove Lab sofa, but the seat height was too short and the back support wasn‚Äôt great, so we‚Äôre returning it. Instead, we‚Äôre getting the Living Spaces Sebastian Cream Couch (L-shaped sectional, right-arm facing) with the pull-out futon/convertible sleeper. The shorter side of the couch 95 inch will be facing the TV while the longer side with the pull-out will be against the window. We measured and it fits nicely, but now I‚Äôm stuck on what rug and coffee table would complement everything.

A few other details: ‚Ä¢	Most of our other furniture is walnut brown wood (desk, cabinet, shoe shelf, TV stand, etc.), since we love that tone. 

‚Ä¢	The sectional is a neutral cream, so I want to bring in a rug and coffee table that balance the warm parquet floors without things feeling too heavy or too ‚Äúmatchy.‚Äù 
‚Ä¢	I‚Äôd like the overall vibe to feel cozy but mid-century modern/organic/intentional.

Would love suggestions on: ‚Ä¢	Rug colors/patterns/materials that would look good with cream + walnut + warm parquet. ‚Ä¢	Coffee table shapes/styles that would fit well with an L-shaped sectional. ‚Ä¢	Any other styling tips (accent chairs, lamps, curtains, etc.) that would help tie the space together.

These are some kind of rockers. Maybe metal, maybe Goth. But there was a ballad there, so you can't tell the genre from the melody.



In the video, the female vocalist walks around in a black-and-white dress that is not fanciful, similar to an old Soviet school uniform or to waitresses in US coffee shops.



The video was released in the late 2000s and early 2010s.



There's a girl vocalist in this dress walking through the woods. Musicians sit on a log and play a tune. But there were no guitarists on the log, there was a drummer and someone else, I don't remember who, but there was definitely no metal guitar visually, but in sound it might have been there in the melody ,but in the video there was no guitar at all.",1,1759367011.0,Music,0,1.0,False

what makes me feel insane is that i can actually do a lot. i just have to be alone /with ‚Äúsafe‚Äù family members. I grocery shop alone i workout alone i drive, i get coffee, but it‚Äôs all painfully lonely. I don‚Äôt have social anxiety but my panic disorder shows up in social situations because i‚Äôm not in control. i have a phobia that makes me panic snd sometimes faint if i even hear certain words.(haemaphohia) Because this has happened so many times my brain equates socialising and being far from home with danger. Anyways- i‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else is in the same boat. I‚Äôve only ever heard people say their panic disorder is ‚Äúrandom‚Äù and they either still have lives or it stops them doing anything at all, like leaving the house. I know i‚Äôm privileged in that i can - but it can be its own torture. it‚Äôs like still being in prison but with a VR headset of what could be.  I‚Äôm sick of doing the same things alone and not being able to do things like take a class or meet a friend for coffee.

1nvq20u,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand_travel/comments/1nvq20u/reporting_back_a_weekend_trip_to_the_bay_of/,Reporting back: a weekend trip to the Bay of Islands,"I asked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand_travel/comments/1kicdov/a_few_days_in_the_bay_of_islands_in_september/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) a few months ago if this was a good idea (driving up from Auckland for a 2-night/2.5-day stay), and thought I report back as we just completed our 5-day trip to NZ.

We were in Auckland for the All Blacks v Wallabies game on Saturday, and given we've been to Auckland a dozen times or so before we were looking for something different to make the trip worthwhile.

Rented a car from Avis, picked it up in Auckland on the Sunday morning then headed north with a short stop in Whangarei for an ice cream and a walk. Arrived in Russell around 4pm. Total driving time with the stop was about 4.5 hours.

Stayed at the [Duke of Marlborough](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DpwmLe9aJJT26wY99), which was perfect for what we paid and what it offered. Russell is a cute little town, didn't do much that afternoon, had a beer on the terrace and walked the shops a little, then headed out for dinner.

For dinner on the Sunday night I had booked [Sage at Paroa Bay Winery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tpbnutNuHWJweq4Q8). Amazing food, great views, delicious wine. Would highly recommend.

On the Monday we had coffee and breakfast at [Hell Hole](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ah2mKBrr9vrsZ3uF7), then we took the ferry across to Paihia and then walked about 30 mins to Waitangi, did the [Treaty Grounds](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V3iwdYWkGD3cxNdJA) (expensive for international visitors at NZD 70, but worthwhile doing once). Spent about 2.5 hours there, then walked back, had a beer in the sunshine on the deck at Paihia wharf and then ferried back across to Russell for a late lunch at [Hone's Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wPcbYM2qg6g9ZpCb6) (great pizza), and a bit more walking around Russell including Flagstaff Hill and the local area. Had dinner on the terrace at the Duke of Marlborough which was excellent watching the sunset.

Tuesday was grey and raining on and off, so didn't do much in the morning mostly trying to stay dry, then just packed everything up and headed back to Auckland around noon (with another stop in Whagarei for a late lunch) as we had to catch an evening flight out of AKL.

Except for the last morning we were super lucky with the weather as it was 22 degrees and sunshine. Was a worthwhile quiet side trip to just not do much at all and enjoy the scenery and weather. Would happily go back for a week or so in summer.

In short: would recommend, even for a short two-nighter like we did. Thanks again everyone for their feedback a few months ago.",14,1759366909.0,newzealand_travel,1,1.0,False

1nvq1ip,https://i.redd.it/eoz9tlozklsf1.jpeg,Thursday,"I climbed out of bed at 8:45am after snoozing an imaginary alarm clock five times. Only, time was all wonky, and then was too soon to tomorrow and tomorrow I had to stay up all day and all night. It's a shame you can't bank up sleep before the fact, I mused, like how you can pay off your sleep debt after a cocaine-fuelled nightmarish bender in an acquaintance's apartment, by sleeping for 21 hours straight, and bargaining sobriety for health with the hallowed name of your God...

My plants were happy in the morning, I had been treating them well. I was unhappy, but not for any particular reason, so much as the long miserable story of my life weighing on my shoulders like a medal of shame.

The Sumud Flotilla was 49NM from the Gaza strip and being water-bombed by Israeli military vessels. My comment about it had recieved 853 likes on Instagram. I locked up the house and walked over the lawn to where Mum was waiting in her car to pick me up. Nobody at the university was talking about the genocide. They laughed and gossiped and poured and drank coffees. 

""Julia.""

""Katie.""

""Ram.""

""Oat cap."" ‚Äî That one was mine. 

The owner, Lawrence, had forgotten my name and never had the balls to ask. I'd bet he'd never even heard of the Flotilla.

""Did you hear about the Sumud Flotilla?"" I asked mum as we walked towards the library.

""Oh yes! Where are they up to with it?""

""They're about 50NM from Gaza.""

""Mm. Oh, hey Janine!""

The university always reeked of pretense and prestige. It was a complicated mix, hard to untangle like the roots of two plants intertwined in the same garden pot. A kind of intellectual authority hung around the leafy campus that made you feel smart just because you were there. But that assumed authority had this kind of amplification effect among the students and teachers which resulted in this subtle internal competition. Everyone was more than happy to put on appearances to remind the outside world that they were all smart ‚Äî that benefitted them all ‚Äî when on campus, in class, with only each other, they smelled the bullshit on each other and each fought a little harder to convince one other they really were that smart indeed. 

You could see it in the way they walked around on campus, shoulders back and faces determined to prove. It hadn't turned out how they'd thought it would, they were still waiting on that good part to come. If they were alone for too long, they'd begin to feel duped. Or stupid. 
Folded arms across binders, shields to the solar plexus, glasses on lanyards.

I judged them back, bitter medicine, holding my coffee up to my face as a tiny shield, a bourgeoise camoflauge.

In the library, mum had said, ""this is my daughter, Ciara,"" to Janine. I met Janine's big fake smile with my own fake disgust. Truth be known, I didn't give less of a shit about Janine or her fake life or her stupid ego and beliefs. 

I felt a little despair when we left the library, realising my slippery grasp on going university at all now. I'd spent the last 7 years half-assing my efforts to attend, never really having the soul to become part of the community, to accept my fate as a stupid mortal human. We stopped at the Free Books and talked a little about folklore. My mother was so different from me.

I closed up again as we walked back toward the car. The brick after brick of my fortress placed came back to me with every step. Each knife in the back, each arrow shot, each laugh that mocked me. I played the familiar game: ""will she help me this time?"" The history stacked its chips for a no. My hope, wearing thin and cracked like porcelain, could hardly hold the weight of my wishes.

""Can you just take me home?"" I disappeared into the pain that I couldn't even tell if was happening now or just predicted. It just blurred together. 

I ran a bath when I got home, and sunk into the hot water desperately. It wasn't much, but it made me feel weightless for a little while, it made my
bones float and my muscles emptier. The water was yellow from the castor oil.

Tomorrow I would fuck men for money. The presence of my ex had waned from my mind, and with it, both the nerve cell disruption and the hopes of saviour.

I was somehow whole again, and yet worse off than I'd ever been.

I (20f) was pretty much raised by and lived with my grandma my whole life. She has some issues, and she refuses to get medicated for them. With this in mind, I have NEVER heard her say the word ‚Äúsorry‚Äù once in my life. Right now, she‚Äôs upset with me because I‚Äôm refusing to talk to her. I am still cordial, as we live in a very small town and seeing her is inevitable. Her, My 6 year old brother, mother, and my 28 year old uncle all live in her house. My husband and I moved out a little over a year ago. She loves to pick fights, over very little things all the time. Like full on silent treatment fights over something as small as the mail or the laundry. My mother moved back in with us in 2021 I believe, she was on drugs for many years and because of that my brother and I got placed with my grandma. My grandma let her be a SAHM and she hasn‚Äôt had a job since she moved back. Well she went and got a job on the weekends (happens to be the only time my husband and I can spend time together as we have opposite shifts during the week) and my grandma asked me if I could go check on my uncle and my brother. My uncle was babysitting for the first time since before my mom moved in. I told her I would, but I would do it once I got back from going grocery shopping. Well, my grandma didnt like that and blew up on me. She went on about how I can never do anything for her just once and how It would have only taken 5 minutes of my time. I left to go shopping an hour(8am) after my mom left for work. I told them I would go over there when I got back, around 11. My mom wasn‚Äôt supposed to get off until 2 that day so I figured it was about the perfect time. Right in between. After she told me I was selfish,I wasn‚Äôt welcome on her property, and all this other stuff. I told her that I don‚Äôt think a grown ass man (my uncle) needs me to go check on him when he‚Äôs baby sitting. He‚Äôs never had an issue before, and she had no issue leaving me as a child 8+ hours with my uncle so I don‚Äôt understand why she had an issue with it with my brother. My mom,uncle and I still talk, and go get coffee very other morning. It‚Äôs been about a month now of not talking to her and my mom told me that she wanted me to come over so I could borrow my mom‚Äôs blender. I told her I wasn‚Äôt going to, not only because my grandma told me I wasn‚Äôt allowed there, an the fact that I still have yet to get an apology from her. I‚Äôm holding my ground on not doing anything until she owns up to her actions, and my mom told me today ‚Äú you know she only grows more resentment every time you don‚Äôt come over when I tell you to.‚Äù I just walked away. I‚Äôve spoken my mind on the matter and if I‚Äôm going to be able to grow and heal on my own and become my own human being I‚Äôm not going to let her walk all over me anymore.

1nvpzro,https://www.reddit.com/r/secretseospot/comments/1nvpzro/online_course_creator_black_friday_email/,online course creator black friday email marketing strategy part 2,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Black Friday, Cyber Monday boot camp. I've been doing this. I've been doing this Black Friday, Cyber Monday boot camp since about twenty thirteen.

I've been running Black Friday, Cyber Monday q four merchandising for ecommerce brands, my own ecommerce brand since two thousand eight, running it from other brands since two thousand five. So I've been in the digital game since it started. I've been doing this a long time, and usually it's just me. This year, I got the Avengers.

I got I got the, Captain Planet. Dude, with our powers combined, we are Captain Planet. I got a a bunch of people from a bunch of other apps that we're friends with over at Zipify to come and tell us, like, what do they see from their vantage point? Because you know what?

One person's viewpoint is a really wonderful thing. But when you get multiple people's viewpoints and you can see things from all different angles, you have a much more holistic view. And there's gonna be, like, if you get one thing out of this that you could use, just one, that's all you need. So really happy.

Thank you for being here. Really appreciate you coming. And, you know, we really value your time. We think that the most valuable thing that you have as an entrepreneur is your time.

And when you choose to spend a little bit of it with Triple Whale, with Omnisend, with Postpilot, with Loop subscriptions, with OpenSend, with us here at Zipify, we're gonna do everything that we can to make sure that you get some value out of it. So let's jump right in. You got three ways to grow a business. Drew Sanaki told me this back in twenty thirteen when he came to my Brooklyn apartment and we were sipping lattes when I've been doing some other stuff.

Sipping lattes. He told me you got three ways to grow your business, buddy. Get more new customers. That's it.

Get more new customers, more new people to buy from you. Get them to spend more from you while they're shopping with you, and then get them to purchase more frequently. That's it. You don't need massive wins in any of these.

You just need about thirty percent each. You could double your business. Everything that I'm gonna be talking to you about is in the direction of one of these three things because that's the only things only levers we can pull. Get more people to buy, get them to spend more while they're shopping, get them to purchase more frequently.

That's the game, dude. So last year, Shopify merchants, recorded eleven point five billion dollars in sales during the cyber five, which is up twenty five percent from the year before, which is actually up twenty five percent from the year before that. So you had seventy six million people purchasing for Shopify stores globally, Four point six million per minute actually on Black Friday itself. One of the crazy things was there was a sixty percent year over year increase in the number of people using mobile expedited payment gateways like Shop Pay in particular had a sixty percent increase, but Apple Pay, Google Pay, these other ones also got increased as well.

Average order value was a hundred and eight dollars. You don't got a discount all crazy on Black Friday, Cyber Monday. You can get, you can do some stuff I'm about to show you how to do and get high average order value. You can see there's a lot to do.

You don't have to do all of it. I'm gonna give you some things that you recognize for me and some stuff you never heard about. You just gotta do some of this stuff. You don't gotta do it all.

Okay? So this is this is the main kinda like if you do at the highest level, if you do this stuff, you build your audiences and build buzz. You start early. You hit the peak days.

You do good merchandising. You do email and SMS way heavier than you think in ads. You mimic your merchandising across every channel, Amazon, Facebook, SMS, Google. You bundle and kit and launch new items.

You do content in around your merchandising. I'm gonna walk through each one of these things. You have an optimized funnel that's mobile optimized. You optimize your ads, and you amplify everything on organic.

This is how you have the best Black Friday, Cyber Monday q four period possible, and I'm a walk through some examples of each of these things. I'm a give you some stuff you haven't seen before. So go early. Yo.

October seventh and eighth, Prime Day. Amazon knows. They're getting they they the reason they do their Prime Day in October is because they're getting q four magic early. They're training everybody to buy early, so you gotta come out and run merchandising on your own website on October seventh and eighth, Amazon Prime Day sale.

So go early. Then from November third to November twelfth, build buzz, build anticipation, Get people excited. Yo. Our sales gonna happen.

It's the best one ever. Sign up. Be the first person to hear about them. I'll tell you why you get people sign up in just a second.

Then you come out two weeks before Black Friday, Cyber Monday. Two weeks and you run your Black Friday, Cyber Monday sale because during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, everyone's getting hundreds and hundreds of emails and SMSs per day. If you go two weeks early, you're gonna get in inboxes. You're gonna get people ahead of time.

I started doing this back in twenty fifteen. It's now become industry standard. Then you actually run, of course, actual Black Friday, Cyber Monday. So each of these campaign phases is gonna have peak days.

Right? So you're gonna have your prime day sale, your early Black Friday, Cyber Monday sale, Thanksgiving day when you open up to the early bird list for the people, that are excited about the Black Friday, Cyber Monday sale, actual Black Friday, actual Cyber Monday, Green Monday, I'm a show you kind of peaks in in in a second. Green Monday is the last Monday in, December that you could purchase and still get it. It's usually December tenth or twelfth, in time for Christmas.

New Year's Eve sale. Okay. Look at this. On your peak days, you're gonna do three emails and two SMSs and double your ad spend.

This is early Black Friday. That's actual Black Friday. This is actual Cyber Monday. That's Green Monday.

That's December twenty sixth. That's December thirty first countdown to New Year's sale. If you do one thing, just one thing, do the countdown to New Year's sale. Take your Black Friday, Cyber Monday merchandising, repeat it on countdown to New Year's last chance to save.

And people who see all your ads all the way since Prime Day, all your emails are gonna buy then because there's there's the last chance. There's a few things in marketing I want you to walk away with. Anticipation, incentive, deadline, and ownership benefit.

When it comes to countdown to New Year, we're talking about incentive and deadline. Your incentive is that Black Friday, Cyber Monday merchandise. We're gonna talk about merchandise in a second, and your deadline is the end of the year. Those two things work really well in marketing.

We're gonna talk about anticipation and ownership benefit in a minute, but hit your peak days hard. Your average order value doesn't have to go down. Look. Our average order value went up thirty one percent on the overtone site, for our our, Black Friday, Cyber Monday in twenty twenty three because we're we're doing things to make that happen.

The first thing is we're doing basket builders. You gotta have basket builders. What basket builder is is is a product that is relevant to all the rest of your items. In this case, it's like, hey, take your navage and stick it.

I don't really understand this one. I don't really like the idea of, virgin resin single use plastics. But this was already in the business when I bought the business, and so it's a real good cross sell that people love. But it's like you could just put it on the stand and elevate it, and it looks really beautiful, and keeps it from getting wet underneath the bottom.

This another one here, it's the cleaning kit for it. And then what we'll do too is we'll take our basket builders. Like, we sell hair color, overtone, and it's like you need gloves, you need a brush, you need these things, you need a bowl to mix your stuff. Bundle them together.

Right? And then offer that as a upsell cross sell through one click upsell on your shopping cart, on your product pages, post purchase, etcetera. Basket builders are really wonderful. They're high EBITDA, high margin, upsells that can be relevant to all your items.

The other thing is you gotta do bundles during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and stick your bundles right at the top of your your your Black Friday, Cyber Monday q four sales page. You gotta have a bundle. You can even take the products you already have and bundle them together. But when you put these up at the top, people shop them more because only fifty percent of people scroll down the page.

The other fifty percent see the Johnson box at the top, see the first row of products. That's it. So you gotta sell your bundles. You gotta be making bundles.

And, you know, there's a reason that average order value was a hundred and eight dollars last year because because people are willing to spend for for a good deal, especially with the way the economy is now. You could really push big, big order volume if you have bundles and if you have basket builders. So some good ways to get your average order value up. Your merchandising is everything.

If you're not doing threshold, we across SmartMarketer agency, we did, some tens and tens of millions of dollars just across a few agency clients that we're running email and ads for last year. We might have been over a hundred, but, what we found was threshold based discounting. Thresholds, twenty percent of in this overtone, what we did was twenty percent off the, up to seventy five, twenty five percent over seventy five. Or and free gift with purchase is the best incentive.

Hey. During the early bird sale, if you shop the, early Black Friday, Cyber Monday, you get this free gift with purchase. It's an item that we have overstock on. It's a it's a high margin low margin item for us, so it's, like, easy to give away, etcetera.

Special bundles, we do order bumps. We have a rotating deal of the day, and then we do content in and around our merchandising. So your merchandising matters. At Boom, we do simpler merchandising, twenty percent off, fifteen percent off, special bundles, things like that.

And then we launch new items, and we, of course, repeat the free gift with purchase during the countdown of New Year sale. But for your merchandising, live shopping discounts, free gifts with purchase, single item promos, limited time bundles, extending. Hey. Cyber Monday's over, but we're opening up for one more day on Cyber Tuesday, like, extensions.

Like, any kind of merchandising that you can do is what's gonna make your sale go well. You can't just do static discount. You gotta have good merchandising. Okay.

So that's kind of some high level stuff. You gotta email on SMS and do ads way more than you think. Three to four times more emails and more SMSes than you think you should send is what you should send because we're not just sending emails, we're doing content. I'm gonna show you in just a second.

In and around our merchandising. So it's like all year long, this is the time period when you can optimize and everyone's there. You know, the milkshake has brought all the buyers to the yard, dude. It's time to purchase.

It's when people are gonna make those purchase decisions, and so you wanna be in front of them, and they're getting inundated. So you gotta show up more than you think you do, SMSes. But also, you cannot just do, regular buy my stuff. I'm gonna talk about content marketing in a second.

But one thing that nobody's doing is us versus them. Us versus them marketing is incredible for the Black Friday, Cyber Monday q four period. You really should be doing it on your product pages anyways. I actually spoke at this event, and I was talking about how Cheech and Chong follow me around the Internet with ads for their marijuana edibles.

And I look at the, pages of the brands that I, that run ads to me, and they had such an amazing us versus them. So I took it and I put it in my, presentation. And afterward, I got a message on LinkedIn like, hey, man. Thanks for the shout out.

And I was like, what the hell? I didn't shout anybody out. I looked at his byline. It was like, responsibility is a heavy responsibility, man.

And so it was a Cheech and Chong guy, and now we do marketing for them. But, in any case, we decided to do us versus them against Neti Pot because Neti Pot's like, I don't want to invite conflict or battle into my world, but us versus them is a really wonderful type of marketing. We've been doing it for a long time. If you do it in a way that is not, mean and nasty, you can do it without, like, it being, rude and bad.

And, you know, in this case, Neti pot is like Band Aid or Vaseline or Q tip where it's it is a product, but it's also the name of the category. Anybody who's got a product in this category, they call it a Neti pot. You go to, Rite Aid and you buy a Band Aid, you call it even though it's Rite Aid brand wound covers, you call it Band Aid. Right?

So, what happened though was that our competitors so our competitors went ahead, and this is like a smaller brand than us, but they did us versus them ad against us, and it's working super well for them. It's like their best ad. So it's a little bit of karma. I did us versus them now.

Some competitors in space are us versus them and against me, and they got a really wonderful landing page. Something I teach, and I'm gonna show you a little bit later, is avatar specific ads to avatar specific landing pages. We're doing us versus them, my safe sleep company. This is my phone case company that I'm part of, and, us versus them ads working really well there.

Here's groons and athletic greens. Athletic greens is the, like, the number one, person in the space, and then groons is the up and comer. They're doing us versus them against them. This is a brand I was doing stuff with.

They do, diapers for bay, babies. Well, that you sell the parents, but the they're for babies. And they're doing us versus them over to the other brand that's the most number one in the space outside of them, and then it goes to a landing page that's like a a presale article in the voice of a mom on her own website that then leads you back to their site. So really good avatar based ad, us versus them that leads to an avatar based landing page.

And then you could see us versus them is a flavor of before and after. It's just a flavor of before and after. You can see here on the right is before and after, but us versus them is just wonderful, and you should be doing it. Now I mentioned after, that I I have us for some on my landing pages too.

Traditional content marketing. So what your brand does, you have to remember, your brand is communicating with a group of people who are sharing a collective experience, And your job is to relate with them about the experiences that they're going through through content and then offer solutions to the problems that they're facing, which are your products. Right? And build a relationship and intimacy and connectedness with them through content.

You know, videos, articles that are related to whatever it is they're going through. I got women over fifty experiencing the aging process and everyone telling them it's bad, anti age, anti wrinkle. Here at Zipify and OpenSend and and Postpilot, we got people who have online businesses that are trying to navigate the world of intensity of tariffs and madness, and we're trying to help them with content. And then also say, hey.

By the way, we got some solutions that we think you'd be interested in. This is a piece of content designed to add value to your life and then ultimately, hopefully, get you to use our products. But the content has to be real, has to have integrity, has to add value, has to be interesting to them. You can see here we're doing Facebook lives.

This one on the left, Facebook live, and there's gonna be a special live only discount. We're doing ambassador videos. We're doing product launches. We're doing five tips for salary suffers.

We're doing, hey. This is this person's experience using our product. Three reasons why our product is a game changer. Debunking myth myths you might not know.

Raise your hand if you brush your teeth this morning. You brush your teeth? Go ahead. Raise it inside your own house.

Yeah. Raise it. Yeah. Well, statistically, some of you are not telling the truth, but I believe you.

I believe your mouth is fresh and wonderful. But, you know, people don't clean their sinuses. And it turns out there's a lot of science now that says that when you clean out your nasal passages, you're much less likely to get viruses, much less likely to get sick. And so that's, like, where our product is educating people about this new you know, hundred years ago, people didn't brush their teeth.

There were no toothbrushes. People were just a little funkier in their mouths. You just got used to it. So this is, like, we're educating about that along with anything else.

And I'm gonna tell you some other things about avatar based ads where you can relate your products to any experience someone's having, like, for example, cleaning their lawn. So you could do gift guides, how to, social media rounds of customer testimonial videos, tips, tricks, and listicles, sneak peeks and founder videos, anything. But you gotta do content in and around your merchandising so that when you're sending three emails a day, one of them is a piece of content with a PS. Go to our our sale PS at the bottom.

If they click the piece of the content, they land on your blog. On your blogs, the the content they might like, and then bam, there's a banner at the top being like, yo. Go to our Black Friday Cyber Monday page. You're still getting them there, but you're doing it through it through content.

Listicles, ladies and gentlemen, if you're not using listicles, you gotta be using listicles. We I I have spent a lot of money in one brand in particular over forty million dollars just on one brand in advertising. Ninety five percent of money goes to listicles. About eighty five percent of my ads right now direct to listicles.

It's a list of stuff, and people love it. And you could do these listicles really easily. You could just build a template out. I can give you my templates.

You can do them inside Zipify pages if you use Zipify user, and then you just make tip. These are all by the way, you'll notice these are all product based listicles. Seven reasons why women over forty five are raving about this soothing under eye cream. Reasons you're overexposed to cell phone usage might affect your health.

Fifty thousand women who love this particular beauty routine. Ten reasons why this guilt free iced coffee is take over in twenty twenty five. So these are all, product specific listicle. But you don't have to do product specific.

You could do, you know, five makeup tips for older women. You do whatever. It doesn't have to be product specific listicle, but you can also do you should have at least one listicle for every product. You should.

Don't sleep on Shop Pay, ladies and gentlemen. Shop Pay, super Shop app, this which is this app right here. You can do campaigns in the back end of your Shopify store. You just turn them on and put a good budget in there and you're gonna make money.

It's really that simple because the shop app right now, they got a hundred million people on top of this thing. Amazon has this app on on their on Amazon app where all the Amazon merchants come together and you can buy from all of them on Amazon's app, and then they could you can get your traffic information in there. One click purchase to everybody. Shopify doesn't want people buying from your website.

Shopify doesn't want people Shopify wants to guarantee people check out with Shop Pay. You know how you guarantee people check out with Shop Pay? You get them inside the Shop app. So Shopify is doing cash back.

They're giving you money in there to shop for, Shopify stores. Right now, three to five percent of your total revenue is gonna be from your shop app, inside the shop app, but it's gonna be twenty percent in four years. They're pushing. Zipify right now, we we negotiated with Shopify.

We became, we integrated with them, and we became the only people who are offering upsells inside of the shop app. We co developed it with them, and, it's a really wonderful opportunity. It's simple. Look.

I didn't come from money. I didn't grow up with money. I had to work full time job while I got my business together. Any little optimization I can do, I'm doing baby.

Mama needs a a a new house. She knows she I got she doesn't need a new house. We built her one. But the point is, any little optimization, I'm trying to do it.

Even if it's just simple setting up my shop, but people don't set it up. Set it up. Turn it on inside the back end of your Shopify. Get yourself going in there because and then you can mimic your merchandising inside of the shop app, and they'll push you in there.

Okay. Mimicking your merchandising. You gotta be on your Facebook shops, your Instagram shops. Look at my Google Ads.

Look at this right here. Black Friday, Cyber Monday. Inside of Google, you just go, yo. I wanna do a promotion, and then I'm gonna tell you what the discount is.

Discount's gonna automatically apply when you click this link, and then, bam, all your Google Ads are now showing your your your, your discounting. Same thing on Amazon. Do your discounting whenever you're running it on Amazon. We're running merchandising from early, Black Friday all the way through the end of the year.

We're running merchandising. We go early Black Friday. We open up big crazy sale, thirteenth to the seventeenth of November. Closed down, but you can still get to our sale.

If you come to our website, there's gonna be a link to our holiday sale page from November thirteenth to December thirty first. You can get to my holiday sale page, but my sale page itself, by the way, post on organic and amplify that organic. All of and we're gonna talk to sell in a second because I got eight more minutes with you. All of October, you're warming up audiences.

You're doing video view campaigns. You're building buzz because the it's cheap to run a video view campaign. Facebook doesn't charge you as much as they charge you when you're trying to get people to leave Facebook, so we're building anticipation. We're reaching the people who are gonna run conversion ads to in November and December with videos about our products, about our brands, with ambassadors, with customers, and then we're gonna convert them in November and December.

And then, from November third to November twelfth, you're building an early bird list. Anticipation, one of the four keys of marketing I was telling you about, is it as a human being, you got, three time periods in which you can enjoy your life before something happens, while it's happening, after it happens. If you embrace those three time periods in your life and you get good at them, you will have a more pleasurable and more fulfilled life. Let's talk some Buddhism for a second.

So you can, do that in marketing too. You can give people an opportunity to look forward to something, and it's really powerful. It's the reason why that every, movie that comes out does a commercial a year ahead of time. There's a reason why that every time Apple does a product launch, they do it six months before the product is available, so you can anticipate.

You can look forward to it. It's a fun experience. Well, we do that for our holiday sales. Now everybody's doing it.

Again, I'm I'm a talk to you about value claims in a second, but I'm claiming my own value. I'm telling you, I started this trend in the industry way back in twenty fifteen. I started doing these early bird twenty fourteen. So not everybody's doing them.

So ads, emails, organic social post goes to an opt in page, goes all the way through to a thank you page, and then gets them on a warm up list. And then that way people can look forward to the sale, and then you're building up the sales comments. It's gonna be the best one ever. The ten percent of people that sign up for this early bird list is gonna be responsible for fifty percent of your revenue.

Ads, you're doing capital letters to open the ads. You're doing emojis as bullet points. You're doing text overlay. You're doing subliminal arrows.

I'm gonna talk to you about peecob ads in a second. But we do a lot of these opt in pages. Every one of our brand, early bird list that works really, really well. Thematically relevant images, headlines, sub headline, opt in, call to action, terms of service.

That's it. Simple. Loads fast on mobile. Works. Gets opt ins. And then during, Black Friday, Cyber Monday time, once November starts, early November, November thirteenth to seventeenth, you run your merchandising.

Don't do fifty percent off. Don't do sixty percent off. Don't do forty percent off. This is before I bought this company.

They were doing this. Do better merchandising than a giant discount. Okay? If you can possibly figure out how.

Buy one, get one half off. Then you gotta run your sale, ads, emails, organic social posts, to a holiday offer page, to your product detail pages, to your shopping cart. We got upsells and cross sells to your two x buyer flow. On your product, your holiday interstitial page, Johnson boxes, baby.

The top of your page, where it says Black Friday, Cyber Monday is gonna change with every campaign phase. First, it's early Black Friday, then it's actual Black Friday, then it's Cyber Monday, then it's Welcome to the Holidays. The the banner changed at the top, then you got your Johnson. So you got a rotating hero, then you got your Johnson box for your best bundle, then you got your bundles.

You got a countdown timer, your three columns on desktop, your two columns on mobile, you're displaying your bundles, you're highlighting your products, you got badging on your products, best seller. You got your unique selling propositions and ownership benefit statements underneath the product in text. You got your review stars, social proof when you hover over a product, a money back guarantee, and a carousel if you got a lot of items. So over, here you can see our our our Johnson boxes going down the page highlighting different items, two columns on mobile.

And when you get to your PDPs, optimize those two, upsells, cross sells, down sells on the PDPs.

You can see here on this one, we got eight hundred skew well, three hundred skews, I think. So we have, you know, product carousel, links to categories. So if you got that, you're gonna link the categories and stuff, but you still wanna have your best sellers on there.

Ads for every campaign phase, Black Friday, free gift with purchase if you're doing that in a particular campaign phase. We did that for early Black Friday. Using peacock, person, product, color, overlay, border. It's an ad formula that I created.

Notice, everyone on my image ads is gonna have a person, a product. It's gonna have a colored background. It's gonna have text overlays. It's gonna have a border on it.

It's gonna have subliminal arrows. These things work. Peacock, baby. You're gonna do, if you're going do it like we launched an item, so we run ads about the new item we're launched.

Our best ads are the ads that have worked all year long, and then we just layer Black Friday, Cyber Monday merchandising over them. We relaunch a new ad that they already work, same ad we've been running, and we just put a badge, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, fifteen percent off. And we do Black Friday, Cyber Monday text so you could take your old ads, renew them again, and then count down to New Year's sale. If you can get some partnership ads, if you can get influencers, ambassadors, your cousin to let you run from their fan page as partners, you get cheaper CPMs.

One it works really wonderfully. We do this a a lot. If you even get one or two of these, it's gonna make your ads a lot better. Authority ads.

Any kind of authority you can get, we sell in retail. So we put that on there. We've got a doctor represent us. We put that on there.

And the key with ads these days is use case and avatar based ads. So who in my marketing? Who's who's the person? Why is it interesting to them?

What are the product and what is the benefits to them? So who is the person? Why are they interested? What's the product?

What are the benefits? So in this case, like, yo, are you somebody who has a lawn who takes care of it? Well, guess what? This person, you know, you got gets a bunch of, sinus irritation after they take care of their lawn, and now they come out and use nivage, and they're talking about that experience.

This one's a girlfriend documenting her boyfriend coming out of town, cleaning the house, and then being all dirty, and then she washes his nose out for him to make him so he doesn't snore and stuff. So, you know, this is relevant to us. And then you got this one that anyone could do, which is, hey.

This is like a customer demonstration video. Everybody knows about those, but this is with a little twist, which is, hey. I love this product, but my friend has never tried it. I'm gonna video them trying it and see what they think about it.

Right? So it's like, I love this. I wanna see my friend who's never tried it, try it. So you get the grand ambassador customer testimonial, but through a different lens.

My boyfriend is gross or my girlfriend is x. My boyfriend is x. Getting somebody to talk about their partner is so compelling, and it could be it doesn't have to be he's gross. He has allergies.

He snores, and I make him clean his head out, but, like, that works for us, you know. So, you getting someone to talk about their partners are really wonderful, how how their product your product relates to their partner or relates to their life in some way, works really well. Firefighter, this is authority. Right?

Firefighters are, authoritative figures. They're going into dirty places and doing doing really good work, and then they're using our product, and we're showing that off. Cities are buck nasty. I lived in New York City ten years.

Gross. It was wonderful. Drew and I were real good buddies when we both lived in New York City. Drew moved back to New York City.

He left again. I was hoping to keep him on the East Coast, but I couldn't. So, you know, hey. Do you live in a city?

It's really gross. There's a lot of smog. Use this thing to clear out your nasal passages and stay healthier. So what is the a particular group of people who are sharing an experience that then related back to your product that you could do an ad specifically about that you could then have a landing page is also relevant to?

Couple little ad copy things before I end, and then I'm gonna pass it over to Drew Sanaki from Postpilot. Social proof story. What is why am I what did this thing do for me? What is like, someone telling their story about how the product, worked for them?

Then an ownership benefit statement. What is the benefit of owning this thing? What will I become? Who will I how will I be perceived?

How will I feel? What what is the end state after I've used this? You gotta communicate ownership benefit in your ads, on your landing pages, in your videos. If you can commute the person the best product doesn't win.

The best promise wins. Who can make the best promise? That's what wins in the marketplace, not the best product. So you gotta demonstrate and communicate ownership benefit better than anyone else, and you will win.

And then, of course, your product has to be good. And then we got peacab layout on the ads, baby. This is me representing my own product here at SafeSleep. Right?

Social proof. Value claim. A value is where you claim your own value. Hey. We're the world's world's first pro age cosmetic line.

Hey. I pioneered awareness, remarketing, and loyalty Facebook advertising for the online marketing industry back in twenty fourteen. Everyone of your gurus today, they were taking my courses back in the day. I was the original one who pioneered that way of marketing.

Look, I didn't create it. It existed in print. It existed in other forms of advertising, but didn't exist on the Internet. I started that.

And so I tell people that because, like, not to be, like, a douche or or to be, braggadocious or but, like, because in order to successfully achieve my goals in my businesses at SmartMarketer and Zipify and my other businesses that are related to, like, marketing to business owners, I have to claim my own value and let them know what I have done so that I, that's how you tell people what you're up to and what's good. You don't have to be rude or or cocky about it, but you just gotta, like, claim your own value. Ownership benefit statement, social proof, avatar call out. This is how I protect my kids.

Right? I I don't want my my kid's not on I don't my kid doesn't have only one years old, but but a lot of parents had their kids on these devices. And it's like, hey. I learned that these devices are this is, in a parent saying this, right, in in the voice of a parent, this ad this is a video.

You can't see it, but it's a testimonial video from a parent talking about how they're using our ad. And it's like, yo, like, you know, I can't keep my kids from using these things, but I can at least protect them from the radiation. Why should you listen to me? Which is like, what is the problem?

And here's this is who I am. I'm a parent. I solve this problem for myself. So it's like, why listen?

That's what I call this little element as a why listen element. In this case, we're using fear. Unfortunately, I don't like to use fear in marketing, but when you're selling anti radiation, fear is kinda one of the elements you gotta use. And then I explain the problem.

Here's what the solution is. A brand identity affirmation statement, which is me as a brand. What do I believe? So example, here, which is less is more as women age.

I believe that. But I only believe I mean, I believe that because Cindy Joseph, who was my product developer and core business collaborator and initial cofounder, she was the real product innovator in the space. We, of course, have innovated, made wonderful products over the last fifteen years, but the initial vision for our products came from her. And what her viewpoint was, hey.

You know what? When I was thirty years old, I wanted a whole bag of cosmetics. When I was fifty five now, I I want simpler. So less is more, is something that we that then a bunch of women reported back to us.

Yes. That's what we we think that too. Less is it's better. So it's a brand identity.

Now boom is a brand. We believe this is a brand, but it's also what our customers believe. So it's brand identity affirmation statement. Controversial statement, if you trigger some controversy, it's a wonderful way.

As long as you stand in on business and you believe it and you're not being an asshole, but you're just saying something controversial, like in our case, we think powder magnifies wrinkles. We think blush is the, blush based, cosmetics, cream based cosmetics are better when you have a a more defined face with, more texture. That's what we think. And but some people don't like it.

So it's a little bit of controversy. Right? Powder magnifies wrinkles. So if you could do a controversial statement in your ads, on your pages, and stand for something, it's a really wonderful thing in marketing as long as you believe it and as long as it's not, like, harmful in some way.

Social proof ownership benefit statement. Notice I'm editing text into my ads. Literally editing into the video, additional headlines. And then, I got my own captions added in ownership benefit statement.

So when someone buys once, I'm done here in two minutes because we had we we we started eight minutes late and then I'm gonna pass over to Drew. Don't consider it a done deal. Go into Omnisend. I use Omnisend.

I'm a big believer in Omnisend, as a email, and SMS platform, and I I love their team, and I love everything about them. I think they're really wonderful. I switched my safe sleep blend over to them.

You buy from me once during my Black Friday Cyber Monday sale. Okay? Then what I say is I wait seven days, and then I'm like, yo. Thank you so much for purchasing.

I really appreciate it. You bought with fifteen percent off. I wanna give you an additional incentive of twenty percent off, extra five percent, and say, you got three days. I'm a send you two emails day one, one email, one SMS day two, two emails and one SMS day three.

Last chance, get stuff for your friends, get items you didn't purchase, get a bigger discount. I'm able to get ten percent of people to buy twice with this simple five email, two SMS over three days sequence within an what does it have? It has an increased incentive and a strict deadline. Right?

Consistency wins in this game. Do one thing that I told you. Do one thing that Drew Sanaki tells you. Do one thing that Francesco tells you.",1,1759366745.0,secretseospot,13,1.0,False

1nvpyeh,https://i.redd.it/gbathnciilsf1.png,I built a Japanese reading app for myself. Your feedback made it better,"Hi! Last week I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Japaneselanguage/comments/1nj9ncu/after_10_years_of_learning_japanese_i_built_the/) about a project I created to make my Japanese learning more fun. After studying for over a decade, I wanted a tool that would feel like reading manga‚Äîengaging and motivating, while matching my language level and keeping the benefits of organized study.

I still can‚Äôt believe how many of you took the time to try the app and give me honest feedback.

I focused on the most requested suggestions and thanks to you, the app now has several updates, including furigana readings, color customization, improved loading time and unlimited stories.

You can test the new version here: [https://kotobatales.com/](https://kotobatales.com/)

To give you the quick idea: It‚Äôs an interactive role-play story where you can:

* Create your own story world by describing the adventure you want to play and shaping how it continues with your replies
* Save words as you read so they reappear later through spaced repetition
* Click on words you don‚Äôt know for translations and ask grammar questions

If you‚Äôd like to be involved in the development of the project, whether by buying me a coffee or by using the app for free and sharing your feedback ‚Äî I‚Äôd truly appreciate your support.

If you use the free version, not that if you hit the daily usage limit, your story action points will be restored the next day.

Let me know what you think and if you have any further requests or suggestions.

Ok so I‚Äôm a 19M. My mum is genuinely amazing, she has done so much for me all my life, but I‚Äôm almost certain she‚Äôs also a reason (I‚Äôll let you decide how big of a reason) for my low self esteem.

History:
My parents got divorced when I was very young, I grew up without a dad. I have some contact with my dad now, and it‚Äôs probably the most I‚Äôve ever had with him, but he still is a crap dad and not a good role model. I‚Äôm the oldest out of me and my sibling, and my mum has raised my and my sibling single-handedly for basically our whole lives, she‚Äôs done amazing job providing us with material well-being. She herself has made significant progress from how much her parents (my grandparents) had when they raised her (they weren‚Äôt in poverty, but they definitely were not rich either). My mum has had a career, and thanks to her we've always had money, food on the table, good living conditions (but not amazing, situations a bit complicated here but it‚Äôs all good), nice clothes, good holidays that even my wealthier friends don‚Äôt necessarily get, luxuries like laptops, phones etc. We‚Äôve never had to not eat out because it‚Äôs too expensive. I‚Äôm grateful because she‚Äôs given me and my sibling a comfortable life. 

Now a big issue is my grandma. She has taken advantage of my mum a lot. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, she‚Äôs done a lot too, and had an even harder life as well (my grandmas mum, my great grandma, died when my grandma was very young, but she has definitely taken more than she should from her own daughter (her one and only child). She has taken way more than she has given. Someone close to us has said that my grandma is stuck in a 1950s mindset where the elders essentially control the young people and they can ruin their life and it‚Äôs fine because they‚Äôre older, and honestly, now that I‚Äôve grown up and seen how she acts, I can agree with this. She doesn‚Äôt understand that times have moved on. Because of this, my mum has looked after raised 2 kids, managed 2 deteriorating houses (ours and my grandmas), and looked after my unsupportive, ungrateful grandma. She‚Äôs done this for the best part of nearly 20 years.

The Present
Now back to the present and our current situation. Me and my sibling are grown up now, meaning it is a LOT easier for my mum now because we can look after ourselves more, help look after my grandma and essentially decrease my mums workload a lot, but we don‚Äôt do enough. I am useless. My social skills are terrible, I don‚Äôt really have much of a network, I haven‚Äôt got social confidence and I can‚Äôt do traditional ""man jobs"" like fixing a leaky sink, general home DIY, car maintenance etc. As the oldest of the young in my household, my mum and sibling look to me as the ""man of the house"", but I‚Äôm completely useless because I can‚Äôt do anything a man of the house should be able to do. They know this and point me out on it. I feel terrible. It also doesn‚Äôt help that naturally I‚Äôm quite stupid, my mum (and now my sibling too) says that I have my dads genetics, because I‚Äôm unintelligent (in a life/common sense way, not academically) like him and I even look like him more then my sibling, both of these things are true, I will be 
honest, but it hurts so much because genetics are something I was born with. My sibling, on the other hand, has definitely got my mums genetics. My sibling is better looking than me, has less health problems, is much more intelligent both in a common sense way and academically (they learn so fast). I feel like some of this is environmental as well though, like I‚Äôve discouraged my sibling from social media, and they don‚Äôt use swear words ever, truly a good soul but I‚Äôm the opposite because I‚Äôm trapped in a pmo addiction. My point here is that they don‚Äôt have this whole self esteem issue like I do (and if they do, it‚Äôs clear that its nowhere near to the extent that I have it).

The Actual Issue
My whole life, I‚Äôve been very sensitive. I don‚Äôt know why, but that's how it‚Äôs been, and I still remember hurtful things that have been said to me throughout life, even if they were truthful and perhaps for my own good. Now, given my upbringing (which you now know about), you would understand that a lot of these hurtful (and sometimes truthful) comments will have come from my mum. Now I understand that she‚Äôs been through so much and that she says hurtful things or snaps and gets angry or is rude to me for a number of reasons like she wants the best for me, is worried for me, even she just needs to take out her frustration and anger (that she‚Äôs been dealing with for decades now) out on someone. She is very sarcastic and rude sometimes, not just towards me, but even to my sibling (who doesn‚Äôt have this self esteem issue), my grandma and just everyone (workers etc etc). I understand, I really do understand now. Her life has been ruined, I now understand because I thought about how I would feel if my life had been ruined, and it is a horrible feeling. We are Hindu, so we believe 
in reincarnation but in a practical sense no one knows, we don‚Äôt remember our past life so this could be our one and only life, and hers was ruined, all because of bad luck and bad timing and bad people. When I think about it I understand why she doesn‚Äôt have much emotional control and is the way she is, and I know I should feel compassion for her, but I find that hard given how much she‚Äôs hurt my emotions and self esteem. My whole life, my mood and self esteem has been dependent on her mood and opinion of me. The hurt of the things she‚Äôs said to me and about me over the years has still stuck in my head, even if she had a good reason for saying it, it still hurts to this day. This has translated to me having low self esteem generally and no social confidence, people don‚Äôt talk to me much, I don‚Äôt value my own opinions, I feel worthless, and although she is my mum, I feel terrible to say this but I have a lot of hate towards the way she‚Äôs treated me. I know she‚Äôs done so much for me, gone through so much for me, and even said hurtful things to me for me (tough love), but I just feel like I can‚Äôt forgive some of the emotional hurt she‚Äôs given me. It‚Äôs really sad to be honest. I want to love her unconditionally, look after her and give her great memories but I just have this deep resentment towards her. Like I said, we are Hindus and we say that mothers are dearer than anything and that a mothers love is truly special. I think about Krishna Ji and Yashoda, or Ganapati and Parvati Maa and just wish we could‚Äôve had a relationship like this but so much has happened. I just have no self esteem and I‚Äôve hit rock bottom, I‚Äôm supposed to be leading my family but I‚Äôm insecure around them and have resentment towards them and I feel like a large part of this is because of my mum. Please anybody give me advice on what to do.


Cambridge Story
Ok I wasn‚Äôt sure where to put this story so I‚Äôll put it here. As the title suggests, this story is about Cambridge, Cambridge University to be specific. When I was in Year 12, we went to the Cambridge university open day. We took the train, and on the train my mum and sibling started having a go at me about my bad skin (I provoked this btw) and they again called me dumb and stupid/idiot etc. So by the time we even got to the Cambridge station my mood had been largely ruined. When we got off the train we go to the coffee shop near the station to use the toilet. There was a large queue so we wait in the queue and I‚Äôm the first of us three to go in the toilet. A few minutes later, in front of a queue of 5+ people, my mum knocks on the door and asks me if I‚Äôm ok. Now she‚Äôs not only ruined my mood but also embarrassed me. I‚Äôm trying to keep it together, but I‚Äôm pretty angry at this point. We then leave and see some people with the university giving directions to people who have come for the open day. My mum says go to them, the thing is there were two sets of people and I went to the wrong set of people, who happened to be selling punting tickets. I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm an idiot for not noticing this but what she did still hurt me so much. Again she shouted my name and said what are you doing pretty loudly and now I‚Äôm embarrassed once again. Then we try to find the right bus stop to get into the city centre, and I‚Äôm struggling and my mum is constantly stressing me out saying things (tbf I should‚Äôve maybe planned the open day better) By this point, I‚Äôm really embarrassed, insecure, shameful and feeling worthless. Then we get on the bus, and she‚Äôs happy and just enjoying being in Cambridge. At this point she‚Äôs just being a mum and doing what mums do, but my self esteem had dropped so low by that point I just felt embarrassed by everything she said earlier. It was evident in my body language that I was just done. Anyway we get off the bus and go look at Kings college (the face of Cambridge). We had a tour and it was nice, but the city felt a bit off and to be completely honest I still didn‚Äôt really like it. Also by this point I was just trying to distance myself from my family because they‚Äôd really pissed me off and I was feeling sorry for myself. Anyway, I went to look at the department, and by this point I‚Äôd had enough. I said to my family let‚Äôs go home I don‚Äôt like it here. I had some pizza for a late lunch (I told them to eat while I went to the department), they sat with me while I ate, then we went back. They were hungry so they got a subway before we got on the train. This makes me feel really bad because on open days students will eat in a restaurant with their family as a nice way to finish the free day but because of my lack of emotional control I ruined this, it was a sad way to end the day and a sad day overall. Fast forward a few months, I achieve a huge academic milestone for me, an A* in A-Level maths in one year. This was a huge self esteem booster (was not expecting the A*) and I earned the respect of my family a lot too. But this made me arrogant, as I now thought I could do anything without working hard. I apply to Cambridge just to see if I can get in or not, and I don‚Äôt give any thought to the college choice, so I apply for St John‚Äôs, one of the most prestigious colleges. Fast forward to October, I‚Äôm now applying to Cambridge and sitting my admissions test, only having prepared a few days before due to my arrogance. I do the admissions test and get an interview with Johns. Everyone is congratulating me and my arrogance is getting even higher, but my mum, and this is a good example of when the truth coming from her has hurt me, says ""Get a teacher to help you with this interview, you don‚Äôt get an opportunity like this often"". What she said was absolutely true, and the right thing to say, but I got angry and I said ok and walked off but I was thinking ""why can‚Äôt she just be happy for me"". I ignore her advice and do my interview alone, with no guidance from anyone apart from my teacher at sixth form with whom I had a short practice interview. As part of my interview I had a question to solve and I had to present my solution in the interview. Now here‚Äôs a good example of my lack of common sense. I thought that, by some magic, St John‚Äôs we‚Äôre watching my every move and that if anyone knew I got help on that question, I‚Äôd be classed as cheating and disqualified from my interview, so I try to do it all myself and ultimately couldn‚Äôt solve it. I do my interview, and I thought it went bad and wasn‚Äôt getting in. Fast forward to January, I get into Cambridge, but not St John‚Äôs, but a different, uglier, less popular, far out college. At first this didn‚Äôt bother me, but when I went to see the college it hit me what a big mistake I‚Äôd made. I saw sixth form as my last happy days, as I knew my college wasn‚Äôt gonna change. The regret and shame destroyed me, I even underperformed significantly in my A-Levels. I got A*A*AA when I was predicted four A*. Fast forward to my first term of uni and I hate it. I will never forget that term, it was one of the darkest periods of my life, all alone in a far out college feeing isolated and away from the beauty of Cambridge. Horrible. I struggled that term the most but things got slightly better in the next two terms, but overall I still got a third in my first year and just about passed, while all my friends are getting first class or high 2:1s in their first year exams and getting amazing internships. Not only this but they‚Äôve left their first year with amazing memories while all I have is sadness and regret. This whole story I‚Äôve just told you is my biggest failure to date and my first big official life regret. Especially given that my academics is a large part of my identity this has absolutely destroyed me. I was hoping to prove a lot of people wrong from school and show them and my family that I‚Äôd be successful. But instead I feel like a fraud. I feel like I don‚Äôt belong at Cambridge.

I‚Äôm going into my second year and starting next week now, but this regret still haunts me to this day. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the open day and thinking if my mum hadn‚Äôt done what she did, or if just kept my emotions in control, I would‚Äôve recognised the beauty of Cambridge earlier and maybe not been in this situation. I‚Äôm not saying that the open day is the sole reason for my failure because of course there‚Äôs so many other factors, but at least if the open day had gone well I‚Äôd have a better starting point. I‚Äôm at rock bottom now in all ways (academically, fitness, pmo, everything). My self esteem is destroyed.

Conclusion
If you‚Äôve got to this point, thank you, from the bottom of my heart for reading my story. I appreciate it so much. If you have any advice on how to improve my self esteem and get out my situation I would truly appreciate it.

Now, I know I‚Äôm anonymous, but a note to my mum and sibling if you ever see this and somehow know it‚Äôs me writing this:

First of all, I‚Äôm sorry but don‚Äôt be angry because it‚Äôs anonymous so no one knows it‚Äôs us. And I‚Äôm sorry, but you guys have hurt me a lot. I know you maybe didn‚Äôt mean to, but what you did, especially in Cambridge that day, hurt so much, and it transformed into even more pain. No one can give me the Cambridge experience I want because you can‚Äôt reverse time. It hurts more that you guys didn‚Äôt realise how much you hurt me that day, and that you didn‚Äôt even apologise. Now though, I‚Äôm gonna work hard for us so we can be happy, even if my uni experience is a bit miserable looking back. It‚Äôs fine guys I‚Äôm praying it‚Äôll be ok. Also if you ever read this, don‚Äôt tell me you read it. Please let‚Äôs never talk about it. If you read it you read it, if you don‚Äôt read this then even better.",1,1759366463.0,Life,1,1.0,False
