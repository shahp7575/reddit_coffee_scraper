1qvzssj,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1qvzssj/expectations_when_you_reach_out_to_someone/,Expectations when you reach out to someone,"Just curious what says the collective wisdom of the group.
 
It is very common that people will reach out to me to talk about career/jobs.  This year, I've already met with 8 people.  These people are wanting to change jobs, complain about their job, looking for direction in their life.  In some instances, I know the person and their work very well.  In other instances, it is a person that I have met a time or two.  

Selfishly, I understand that I am a well connected person in my field/region and have a reputation for making things happen.  I think I am also pretty approachable, tell people my door is always open, give out my cell and most often will say yes.  And I like to help people.  

But I am often confused as to what the other person is trying to achieve in the meeting.  There is rarely an ask.  I try to not give unsolicited feedback/advice.  I might reflect back what I think I am hearing if the person sounds a bit unclear.  At best the person might say to keep them in mind if I hear of any openings.  

So, for those of you that reach out or would like to reach out to someone in your network....reasonably, what would you want the outcome of a coffee meeting like that to be?  

(FTR....I stopped asking the question of what do you hope to accomplish in this meeting.  I found it too direct and it put people on the defensive/embarrassed).",1,1770236636.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

b) The machine in use and how to get coffee/water/grind ratio correct

What i cant are any videos, views or thoughts on how people clean it up each day after every brew, how long it takes, and how much of a hassle it is (if at all).

Can any one link a video explaining this part of the brew process or advise here?

1qvzm7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Timberborn/comments/1qvzm7b/suggestion_the_bad_water_pump_its_kind_of_useless/,SUGGESTION: The Bad Water Pump its kind of useless. So I had an idea.,"A bad water pump is basically useless most of the time. It is simply much more efficient to seal the source of bad water, as it increases uncontaminated space for crops, etc.



So I thought: what if the bad water generates ANOTHER resource, which NEEDS flowing bad water? And how would this feature be used?



Well, based on my idea of ​​a farm on the walls, I present to you the DECANTER, which produces: REINFORCED WATER (or) FERTILIZERS.



Reinforced water can be enabled for several recipes that use water with varying effects: some recipes increase disposition (new recipe using coffee for Ironteeth), others decrease the chances of injuries in general, and others the chance of generating new beavers (new herbalist recipe for Folktails). In terms of mechanics, it is similar to the Ironteeth's efficient mine.



Folktails and Ironteeth can use fertilizers to increase the chance of generating additional food during harvest.



The construction to generate this resource has a special format: it is the equivalent of a dam one block high by 3 blocks long, with two blocks extending at mid-block (for worker input and ""pure"" water output). The ""dam"" part is solid, the water outlet and entry location are not.



I didn't think about the amount of energy or whether it needs other resources. The basic idea is that it needs to capture the bad water, but also other elements present, which the centrifuge and the dome ""lose"" while sealed or at extract obtaining processes.



In the case of a new faction, the ""dam"" is triangular in shape: one block high, but the dam itself has 5 blocks, 3 blocks where the entrance is (plus two workers) and another block where the ""pure"" water exit is. They can generate fertilizers and boosted water simultaneously, or individually. Producing both simultaneously is less efficient than producing just one resource. Plus it's an early game build - almost mid-game for this faction, which uses wall farms as their main mechanic (hence the need for them to need fertilizers earlier, the boosted water is, in their mindset, a ""bonus"").

I pull doubles for my coffee and singles for my wife’s. I grind at 7 or 8 for mine and around 21 for hers. I drink more coffee and when I pull my shots consistently they come out with a near perfect stream and timing. I have noticed however the first pull when switching back after making a single it sputters and the timing is sometimes off. I can then pull a second shot with the same settings and it’s back to being fine. Does the machine struggle going back and forth? 

Second sometimes after steaming manually (we exclusively steam manually) the machine makes some loud noises as if struggling. It has caused zero problems but the noise can be concerning. Only happens like 1 in 15 froths.

How much mulch did you use? What brand of string lights kept your plants alive? Anything you think would have made a difference?

I'll start. Our area's low was 28⁰ with the rest of the work week in the 30⁰'s at night. All my plants had string lights. I don't know what oz my frost bags were but I'd guess 1.5-2oz.

I swadled my coffee tree in a very thick blanket and it still died, so I wish I had just dug it up and taken it inside.

My 3yo 6' true cinnamon got a frost bag for the top part and a sheet to cover the trunk. It still died. I think it could have toughed it out if I had used a thicker cover. 

My 4yo poncho avacado was supposed to be cold hardy to 20⁰ and it still took on a ton of damage. I think the extreme weather whiplash from hot to cold did it. 

After one night of failed coverage because the wind was 23mph, I dug up my elephant ears and kept them inside and I'm glad I did. All you really need to protect is the roots and they'll bounce back.

2yo Key lime tree got a flannel sheet and a frost bag and a string light and still died.

5yo Olive tree, apple trees, Firecracker bush, bottle brush, sweet vibernum, and asiatic jasmine weren't covered and didn't even flinch. No real damage, just some dropped flowers from a warm winter. 

1yo Bush daisies were covered and are totally fine, just some dropped petals. 

My outdoor 15yo aloe got two fuzzy blankets and survived 

I have a 2yo bergamot that got severely damaged from too much rain, but the remaining yellowed leaves are completely unchanged. I just gave it a frost bag and bed sheet.

My 2yo shiranui mandarin wants for nothing, it got one cover and a bed sheet and had zero damage. 

4yo Eureka lemon lost almost all its leaves with a cover and sheet. I bark is still green though so I think it can recover. 

I have three types of Arabian jasmine. The grand duke were fine with their one cover.  One Belle of India will need about ⅓ of it pruned back, but the second is still undamaged. Two baby Maid of Orleans were also fine. They're planted next to each other and got one long cover that I think could have been thicker.

Shockingly enough, I have some morning glory sprouts that survived with one thin cover folded 3 or 4 times and held down by rocks.

I saw a lady crying on the side of the road after another car had allegedly run a red light and bumped into her. I stayed with her for a while just to calm her down while she explained what happened, then stayed when the other person came over after calling their insurance and seemingly getting everything settled. The lady had initially called the police but then called them off after the other person was nice and admitted fault. I thought everything was settled after that.

Later I get this text from the lady—she says she's gonna file a lawsuit over the wreck and was asking me to testify what she had told me (about how the car spun 360 degrees after impact). Personally I only gave her my number because she'd mentioned maybe grabbing a coffee as ""thanks"" after this, and I'd assumed that I'd just gain a friend, but now she's asking me to at least write an affidavit and notarize it before I leave the state.

I really don't know either of these people. I don't want to be involved and have my name on a case that I don't know anything about. She'd talked about being involved in various other lawsuits against people that had wronged her, but now I can't help but doubt because I really don't know these people at all.

# MEMORY TRANSCRIPT | BRIGAM IRONS

**Date:** Anno Domini 2263, Jul-25  **Location:** The Veil Nebula, Sector 77 (Uncharted)

The *DMS Manifest Destiny*. My pride and joy.

Look at that magnificent city buzz. Look at her go.

She was a moving mountain of gunmetal and industry, a two and a half mile brick of defiance floating in the dark. Ever since she was launched from the shipyards of Proxima Centauri fifteen years ago, she had never seen home again.

I sat in the command chair, nursing a mug of lukewarm synthetic coffee, and thought about that. I thought about whether I missed ""home.""

Well, not really.

There was nothing to see in Proxima Centauri but factories, power plants, more factories, more plants, and the inside of a sterile lab. I didn’t miss the smog, and I certainly didn’t miss the politics.

I’d shot down a good handful of Krauts, pilots, back in the day, during the border skirmishes. The war never went hot on the colonies; that was an understanding we both had. None of the ""excitement"" for the civilians. Who wants to get blown to bits in the depths of space over a mining station? No, this sweet taste of violence was reserved for us poor old boys rolled off the assembly lines.

Things had been quaint recently. Avalon Command sent me out here to probe the nebulas, set up a refinery, establish a Forward Operating Base, and scout for planets. Big fancy words for busy work. I hadn’t seen the Krauts in a year. They must have gone somewhere else. Different directions, maybe.

The system before me was promising, though. I took a sip of the sludge in my cup. Red dwarf star, metal-rich nebula. It could probably support a habitat station. Maybe even a shipyard, if we stayed long enough.

""Commodore, you ought to see this,"" my Lieutenant Commander spoke up, breaking my reverie. He was looking at the long-range sensor plot. ""Looks like the Krauts beat us here.""

I frowned and looked out the main viewport. Deep in the nebula, cutting through the purple dust, was a formation of jagged, white ships. Destroyers, by the looks of them. They were hunting something.

""Bullshit,"" I grumbled. ""Hail them. This system has been claimed by the Mandate. Tell them to get off my lawn.""

""Aye aye.""

We sent a broad-spectrum hail toward the fleet. Silence.

""They're not answering, Commodore.""

""Figures. Rudeness is a prerequisite for the Union,"" I muttered. ""How about tha-""

""Commodore! Incoming fire!""

I blinked. ""Well, ain't that just *dandy*.""

Fighting over a couple of old dust clouds? Didn't seem like their style. But then again, maybe they were just bored. Ah, well. It was about time the boys stopped rusting in maintenance.

""Attention on deck!"" I bellowed into the comms.  ""Man battlestations. Spin up the reactors.""

The *Manifest Destiny*, which had rested quiet for years, roared back to life. The deck plates vibrated as the fusion cores cycled up. Twelve nuclear railgun broadsiders, fifty heavy auto-cannons, and five hundred interceptors began to wake up.

I could feel the *thump-thump-thump* of the Marines rushing from secondary maintenance to the hangars, followed by the high-pitched whine of the combat drones coming online. The ship was stretching its muscles.

""Commodore, incoming torpedoes.""

""Torpedoes?"" I looked at the tactical plot. ""Since when did the Krauts start using torpedoes again?""

""Not that I know of, Sir.""

""Are you sure it's a torpedo?""

""Seems like it,"" the Tactical Officer said, sounding confused. ""Armored front, engine at the back, and a shit-load of explosive elements inside. Clunky piece of shit.""

""Language!"" I barked. ""Now, shoot it down.""

I gave the order. The Point Defense Grid didn't even have to try. The front-end Aegis lasers swiveled, spat a few beams of coherent light, and the incoming warheads detonated in the darkness of space, thousands of miles away. They never got anywhere near the ship.

""That's why we don't use them anymore,"" I shook my head, taking another sip of coffee. ""What the hell is going on in their heads? Their High Command ought to flog that commander for incompetence.""

""Second salvo, Commodore.""

""Shoot it down,"" I waved my hand dismissively. ""And hail them again. Tell them if they keep this up, we’re going to return fire.""

The Lieutenant hailed them. No response. Once again, the laser grid swatted the torpedos out of the sky like flies.

""Third salvo, Commodore.""

It was picking at my guts. I felt a migraine coming on. This wasn't a skirmish, just a God damned insult.

""Alright, you know what?"" I set my coffee down. ""Launch a few companies. Send two hundred Archangels. If it's the Krauts, I want every single one of them hog-tied and brought to the brig.""

""And if it's not the Krauts, Sir?""

""Well,"" I paused. ""If they find, I don't know, fucking aliens with four eyes and six legs and green blood, which might explain what the hell is going on... then kill 'em. But I don't find it very likely that the Good Lord would put such a nuisance out here just for us to blow up.""

""Aye aye. Launching Archangels.""

I watched as the swarm of the F-99 Archangels and their buzzing Cherub escorts rushed from the shadow beneath the bridge into open view. Look at 'em go. They weaved forward leaving only trails of blue ion fire behind them.

Strange. They weren't even trying to shoot them down. A few laser shots here and there, no flak. It was like they had suddenly forgotten the song and dance we'd been performing for the last hundred years.

""Incoming fire!"" Tactical shouted. ""Kinetics! High velocity!""

""Kinetics? Finally, some respect,"" I grunted. ""Alright. Return fire. Port broadside.""

I shouted the command, coffee back in hand. The *Manifest Destiny* groaned as the maneuvering thrusters fired, turning the two and a half mile city on its side.

Six ""Judgment"" railguns lit up. *CRACK-THOOM.*

Seconds later, physics took over. Two of the jagged enemy destroyers simply shattered into expanding clouds of hot debris. Another two had their hulls shoved upside down, drifting dead in the nebula.

A minute later, the Archangels arrived at the wreckage. I waited patiently for the Marines to board and bring me the German commander so I could ask him what the hell was wrong with that sponge in his skull which was clearly not a brain.

""Commodore, we got a situation.""

""What now?""

""It's not the Krauts.""

I paused. ""Are you sure?""

""According to the Marines... there are the ugly ones, and there are the cute ones. The ugly ones have four eyes, six limbs, and bleed green.""

""Are you sure it's not the Krauts?""

""Affirmative, Captain. Unless the Union has changed their recruitment standards drastically.""

Well, I'll be damned. First Contact. 

Then a thought flared across my head. Wait a minute.

""Did you say there were *cute* ones?"" I asked. ""Cute like you find a puppy cute?""

""Cute like how you'd find your superior's daughter cute, Sir.""

I swiveled my chair to face him. ""Do you find my daughter cute, Lieutenant?""

""No, Sir!"" He went pale.

""Good. Because I've never been married. It'd be a horrid thing if I did have a daughter.""

I chuckled and turned back to the screen. We sailed deeper into the nebula, past the burning wreckage of the ugly ships. Beyond them, drifting near a gravity well, was a fifth ship.

It was delicate. Smooth. Graceful. White and gold curves. Sensors indicated a civilian craft, no armaments, battered and venting atmosphere.

""Ain't that just dandy,"" I murmured. ""The cute ones. What do they look like?""

""Women, Sir. They look like frail women, thin as a willow. According to the boarding team, the ugly ones were executing them until we showed up. Sounds like they're trying to talk to the boys, but we have no idea what language they're speaking.""

The Lieutenant looked at his comms relay again, squinting.

""Oh. One small thing, Sir. They don't look *just* like women.""

""Spit it out, son.""

""They've got big, goofy rabbit ears. But... they're sideways. And human.""

I stared at him.

""The hell is that supposed to mean?""

""Well... we'll see, Captain. Why don’t we tow their ship to the hangar?""

I ordered the white ship towed into the main hangar. It was a delicate operation. That ship drifted into the cavernous bay like a pearl rolling into a coal chute.

The Senior Medical Officer, Dr. Bradley, buzzed me on the comms.

""Commodore, I suggest we lower the artificial gravity of the Medbay and the Hangar Deck,"" he said with an air of professional concern in his voice.

""Why's that?""

""Initial reports from the boarding team indicate the gravity on their ship is low. About 0.2, maybe 0.25 Gs? Their bone density according to the paramedics is likely avian. If we subject them to standard Mandate gravity, we might crush them just by letting them stand up."" He paused, then coughed. ""Well, assuming you'd want to treat the... specimens? Have we decided on an official classification yet?""

I took a loud sip of my coffee.

""Ach, what sort of a monster do you take me for, Bradley?"" I grumbled. ""Of course we're going to treat them. They're guests. Drop the gravity plating in Section 4 to 0.15G just to be safe. Tell the Marines not to jump too hard or they’ll be bouncing off the ceiling.""

I gave the order and watched the screen as the luxury airliner finally settled onto the deck. It was a beautiful ship, indeed. Not fit for war, too many curves, too much glass, but beautiful. I wondered what a civilian craft was doing this deep in the nebula.

As soon as the airlock hissed open the scene turned to triage.

Teams of Marines acting as paramedics rushed out carrying stretchers. The aliens were spilling red. Badly. Through my optics zoom, I saw the wounds. These weren't just shrapnel tears or bullet wounds. Some of them looked like they had bites taken out of them, the huge, jagged tears in the flesh.

A few of the uninjured aliens stumbled out of the ship. They were weeping, holding onto each other, their knees buckling as they tried to walk on our deck. No doubt they’d lost someone important.

Then came the other bodies.

The Marines dragged out the corpses of the four-eyed, six-limbed bastards drenched in their own green ichor by their chitinous legs and kicked them unceremoniously down the industrial garbage chutes.

""Must be copper-based blood,"" Bradley commented over the open channel, watching the green smear. ""Oxidizes fast.""

""Seems like we'll need an order of coffins for the others, though,"" my Lieutenant murmured. He looked like he had a great deal of sadness in his eyes as more delicate, red-blooded corpses were evacuated from the white ship and laid bare on the hangar floor.

""Why don't we ask the aliens?"" I put down the coffee. ""What would they think about you putting their dead in boxes?""

The Lieutenant hesitated. ""Captain?""

""We'd better call the Chaplain,"" I said, rubbing my temples. ""A show of respect. Give them a service. If they recognize it, then good. If they don't... well, they don't deserve a funeral if they can't appreciate one.""

I summoned the Chaplain to the hangar.

*Rabbit ears, huh?*

The scene was sad as it was, my mind still wandered to the description. I zoomed my optics in to max magnification on one of the weeping survivors.

""Hmm. Well, the only resemblance I see with rabbits is that they're long,"" I muttered. ""Those ears are sideways. And pointy.""

""You ever read Tolkien, Captain?"" Lieutenant Johnson asked me quietly.

I glanced at him. ""Tolkien? Sure. Who doesn't remember Tolkien? The great author of fake languages and bedtime stories.""

""I quite enjoyed those books, Commodore. You know, they remind me of the... uh... the Elves?""

I looked back at them. The pale skin, the sharp features, the ears, the general look of being made of glass and pretension.

""You want to start calling them Elves? That's fine by me,"" I shrugged. ""I'm getting tired of calling them 'the cute ones' or 'aliens.' Elves it is.""

Down in the hangar, the ship’s Chaplain arrived dressed in his black vestments. He stood before the somber Marines and the hysterical Elves. He raised a hand and began to chant the Rites of the Dead.

It seemed the newcomers, despite a lack of language, did not lack understanding.

They calmed. They stopped their wailing. They watched the man in black, sensing the ritual. As the Chaplain knelt for their dead, the Marines bowed their heads and closed their eyes. The Elves followed suit, bowing their heads in a universal gesture of grief.

I closed mine as well.

A moment of silence for the dead.

Its a tool.,"So much BS floating around. I weighed 220 Nov '24. I took Ozempic until July '25. Never more than .5 dose. Far from the max 2. I tapered off at end to .25 too. By July I was 162.

Now Feb 2026. I have been off Ozempic Since July and my weight varies between 158 and 160. I took what I learned from Ozempic about my calorie needs and watch what I eat. Which is very little. If I loosen up and eat snacks etc, I will start gaining FAST and I will get hungry all the time. If I dont snack and stick to the program I can lose any gained pound and maintain. Plus NOT SNACKING or overeating means I do get hungry but not so bad and I ignore it. I know how much my body needs. Which is 1600 - 2000 calories a day depending on activity. Means I have to choose wisely. Eggs, meat and veg. An apple maybe. Not sugar, chips, pie. I simply dont have an allotment for that after meeting nitritional needs. If I sit all day 1200 calories and done. This is very little food. 

I dont need Ozempic. To be honest I NEVER NEEDED Ozempic. I knew from past experience about calories in,  energy out. But I fell off track and developed bad habits. Ozempic was a tool to retrain myself. Overeating was undesirable and uncomfortable for me on Ozempic.  I lost weight because I cut my eating ALOT. That simple. I keep the weight off now using same logic. I have a freind who's been on it for YEARS. She's big. She eats way to much so has lost maybe 40 of the 200 she needs to lose. She ignores the signals and so its not working out great for her. She's always been that way. Eats alot of pie, basically milkshakes at Starbucks etc. Sneaks in muffins, chocolate and pretends its small and doesnt count.  Its not magic Ozempic, its a tool.

I'm not trying to sell anyone just posting my experience. In fact YOU DONT NEED OZEMPIC if you have will. As I type this I'm hungry right now. But I already ate a 3 egg cheese omelet. Thats it until dinner. PERIOD. Thats how this works without drugs. No one NEEDS Ozempic. Personally I fell into a space where that tool sure helped me though. No handfuls of peanuts, candy, cookies. No sugary coffee drinks. Just count every calorie and choose nutrition first. A bite of chocolate one n awhile. But really, there's no calories left over most days to allow for that sort of thing. People constantly offer me this crap. Everywhere we go its crap crap crap of empty calories. Just say no. If we all stopped buying crap, then they'd start offering us carrots instead.

Ozempic is a tool to learn better life choices. For someone who just wants to eat whatever and blame genetics, don't bother and enjoy your pie. Ozempic doesnt burn fat. Calorie deficit does and Ozempic  simply makes overeating uncomfortable .... IF ... big IF you pay attention to those signs and dont just eat thru them like my friend. She should just accept thats they way she wants to live and fat is consequence, the end.  I have been both fat and thin several times in life. I hope this is the last.  The path to thin was always the same. The only thing different  with Ozempic was relearning how to get there at an older age where I, like so many, had convinced myself it was age etc making me fat. It wasnt. It was TOO MANY CALORIES. Count everything, butter, milk ... EVERYTHING.

Being older isn't low metabolism either. Its low activity. Its having the money to buy snacks and time to eat them. Thats why older people get fat. Its not anything to do with genitics. Its about habits. Less activity, more food, more lies to self. When I was 20 I was never  still. No money so I ate little and  no car so I walked, biked.  Now  at 55 I'm still a lot.

1qvzik6,https://i.redd.it/4o41s4bkcjhg1.jpeg,Is opening a cat cafe purely run on donations with hand picked cats available for adoption a bad idea,"This is Minnie she came from a house with around 90 other cats. She is 3 years old and very small although spiritually confident she isn't even scared of fireworks. Hasn't quite got the hang of jumping on furniture but has now learned to meow and purr. She loves sleeping under my kayak in a little cat house in the rain and on chilly days. She has only experienced winter so far so spring and summer are going to be exciting for her. Anyway, she inspired the cat cafe.  I envision a main living room area available for free to hang out with the cats which choose to be in that area. Sofas, TV's, Rugs, self serve tea and coffee and of course cats. Toys are free to play with and treats are just 25p each all proceeds going to funding cat food, toys and medical insurance. Donations are appreciated and will go to funding rent and whatever else the cats directly need to keep getting adopted and taken care of. You can also donate directly to the rescue who took in the cat. There will be a seperate room where the cats stay which is again a living room only difference being nobody is allowed in there its so cats arent forced to interact with people they don't want to. Since vibes will be just hanging out with cats they will be fine just hanging out in the next room. Chosen specifically for their individual characteristics that make them ideal for a regular home, cats that have been available for a long time. Donations pay for rent and everything else. Is this silly of me to want to do i already found some beautiful business properties for an extremely good price. Im looking at places with a toilet for humans, a small kitchen and a catio where you can be with the cat outside",1,1770236024.0,berkshire,0,1.0,False

This is when I can somehow miraculously sleep for 5-6 hours (8 hours total in bed) and so sometimes I would wake up way too early but only having 4 hours of actual sleep. Say I went to bed 1030pm (actual 1130pm sleeptime) BUT waking up at 510am, still about 4-5 hours. I feel great and energized but know come 6-7am I will feel like I'm just underwater until I can get that coffee, underwater in caffeine for the rest of the day. I can take a nap RIGHT away, or later at lunch time which is usually better BUT I can also eat any type of meal, even heavy ones, and I can fall asleep right away and feel relaxed. Usually this nap will be just 15-30 minutes OR 2-3 hours to catch up for the 6-8 hours of perfect sleep.

1qvzck2,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1qvzck2/i_drank_coffee_for_nearly_50_years_quitting/,I drank coffee for nearly 50 years — quitting revealed how much it really controlled me.,"I’m 57 and have been drinking coffee since I was about 11.

About 10 years ago, I switched to decaf — usually one cup a day in the morning.

Two months ago, I quit all caffeine completely — coffee, tea, chocolate — and the change has been incredible!

I’ve always had some level of anxiety. I remember struggling in high school with focus and worry. Over the years, my anxiety worsened — heart palpitations, restlessness — which is why I moved to decaf. That helped a bit, but it never went away. There was always some internal “noise,” never calm, never peace.

Quitting caffeine entirely was an experiment to see if I had a sensitivity.

The first couple of weeks were brutal — groggy, headaches, feeling unwell — which shocked me given I was only drinking one decaf cup a day.

Then things started shifting. I felt calmer, almost blissful, but also spaced out and daydreaming a lot. It was unlike anything I’d experienced.

My confidence completely flipped. I went from socially anxious to effortlessly confident. I can maintain eye contact, communicate on autopilot, and feel no anxiety — something that was never me before. 

Focus and energy have skyrocketed. I used to crash late afternoon at work, arrive home tired and grumpy. Now, I have seemingly endless energy and patience. I can work all day on one task without boredom or distraction — something that plagued me my entire life.

Apparently, the best part is yet to come! They say it can take four months to fully reset your nervous system and hit your true baseline. Looking forward to reaching that milestone.

The only downside? Realizing that my whole life, from my first coffee at 11, has been governed by caffeine — decades of anxiety, panic attacks, and lack of focus. I always thought I was just a naturally nervous person. I was wrong.

I hear so many people struggling with anxiety or taking meds, and I can’t help but wonder: what if caffeine is their nemesis too?",1,1770235665.0,decaf,1,1.0,False
1qvzcdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qvzcdq/i_want_to_get_rid_of_my_colleague/,I want to get rid of my colleague,"Okay, hi. I'm a 26F working at a company. I'm a new employee there, and honestly, I love my job, my department, my manager, everything is great, and the work itself is fantastic.

Then I met a 24F employee from another department. Let's call her Rose. Anyway, Rose is a sweet, kind, and gentle girl who loves to talk a lot. At first, we only chatted while making coffee, when we passed each other, sometimes at reception, and sometimes at lunchtime. But at lunchtime, I prefer to eat alone.

Then things escalated, and she started coming to my office and sitting for hours. Little by little, she started coming and sitting next to me all the time—I mean all the time! As soon as she finishes her work, she comes and sits with me until the end of the workday! This really bothers me.

Imagine doing your job while someone next to you is glued to their phone the whole time!  I can't stand it. I don't see anyone else doing it, and I've never seen or heard of anyone doing it. Even close friendships aren't like this. Her manager told her to stop sitting next to me for so long, but it's no use. I've even hinted that she should leave, saying things like, ""I'm busy right now, I'll come when I'm done."" And do you know what she replied? She said, ""Oh, no problem, I'll just sit next to you!"" Another time, I was on the phone, and she stayed right next to me and didn't leave until a long time later. Another time, I told her I was busy right now, put on my headphones, and started watching a movie on my phone while I worked, and she still didn't leave! I'm so tired of it.

I don't like anyone sitting next to me all the time while I'm working. To clarify, when she sits next to me, she pulls a chair from the empty office and puts it in my desk and sits there. I have to make room for her!!

What should I do? How can I get rid of her? What should I say to her? Despite all this, she's a nice girl and there's nothing wrong with her at all; it's just that this bothers me so much.",1,1770235655.0,Advice,7,1.0,False
1qvzbs8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qvzbs8,Tamping styles and decisions [HiBrew H10B / Shardor connical burr],"Hello everyone, 
Recently, 2-3 months ago, I entered the world of espresso as someone who wanted to drink a better coffee than ready-to-make coffee pods. I knew this world was full of practice to get a good cup of liquid. After experimenting with dosage, temperature, extraction time, and ratios, I hit another wall with the tamping variable. 
Currently, I brew with a HiBrew H10B 51mm bottomless, 92°C, 14g in 30 g out, around 25-30s with 3 seconds pre-infusion, 2-3 water sprays before grinding, WDT, tamping, puckscreen. I'm using a medium roast, 2 weeks from roasting coffee, every time freshly grinded to respect the ratio and time. I usually dial by taste, but I try to improve and experiment with the actual recipe sometimes.

Now I tried, after tamping, to slide the tamper on the sides of the puck, and to my surprise, I realized that the coffee started to move. After a full circle, the coffee was pressed a lot harder. So much harder, with the same variables as before, that my extraction took 10 seconds more( 41s in total). I was blown away. 

The shot had a bitter aftertaste, but not so much considering I was 41s  in pulling a 14g coffee dose. The biggest problem was that after the shot, the puck had a serious height difference from one point to another( I attached photos to see the measurement in CM ). The tamper I use is a simple one, flat-bottom measuring 112g. Most of the time I try to press the puck with all the force, keeping my elbow in 90° angle and a straight hand to apply even pressure on a flat surface. Now the experiment puts me in a situation where I question my ability to tamp coffee properly, giving the fact the huge extraction time difference. 

I clearly understand that due to the level difference on the resulting puck, there was a lot of channelling, but my usual shot might have channelling due to not applying a correct pressure? 

What's your opinion on it? 
Do you think I need a better tamper? The one with the spring? 
Or should I just practice my technique with the one I have?
How can I practice it besides making coffee? 
What to watch for when doing it, coming from your experience?",2,1770235621.0,espresso,5,0.67,False
1qvzbf5,https://i.redd.it/meki60j2bjhg1.png,Code for photorealistic style + advanced prompt for generating women's photos (v2),"I haven't been here for a while. The model has changed a few times in the meantime. These days, it tends towards drawings and anime rather than realistic photos.

To make matters worse, the current model doesn't respond to negative prompts. Fortunately, I managed to achieve a number of styles that, in my tests, statistically minimized the cartoonishness and artificiality of the generated images.

Just select ""no style"" as the style in any perchance generator and paste the code below at the beginning of your prompt.

A few months ago, I wrote a post on how to create various images from a single prompt. If anyone is interested in the technical details or how to use weights (e.g., \^3/\^0.1, etc.), I encourage you to read that post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/perchance/comments/1no1zua/i\_made\_advanced\_prompt\_for\_perchance\_image/](https://www.reddit.com/r/perchance/comments/1no1zua/i_made_advanced_prompt_for_perchance_image/)



Now I'm presenting a new version of the prompt for generating random women in various positions. Although the prompt is designed to generate SFW images, the current generator sometimes adds nudity and eroticism to the images, so be warned about that. This could probably be reduced by changing the weights(/types) of clothing and poses, but I'll leave that to your experimentation.

Even if you're not interested in this particular prompt, I'm including it here because it might be useful to some. It shows how to use the syntax for this type of prompt. It's also easy to convert to NSFW, but I won't help with that; those interested will find their own ways. Just select ""no style"" and paste the entire text below into any generator.

I’m a newly licensed Pharmacist from Davao City, and I’m SPIRALLING!!! First of all, I wanna clarify that I’m still acknowledging the fact that a measly income is better than just doing nothing and waiting for the heavens to give you that amount. Although, I’m also not saying if that opportunity happens, I’m not going to catch it. And I REALLY am not saying that a bit of basic salary increase WON’T k\*ll anyone. I understand the concept and principle of how economy works, but everything still feels bull.

So, I applied on 3 HVA agencies and 2 of them already turned me down for “not being qualified” enough (not even being interviewed nor trained yet) c. I’m really hoping I get to be chosen by the last agency and pass everything that needs passing OML!!! I applied here first because of the generous salary and wfh convenience. While at the same, I’d be doing basically the same exhaustion when I work in local companies (on-site).

I get so emotional whenever I think about not being hired. Honestly, I really blame how BAD the Philippine economy is. I wanna serve my country but the paycheck is NOT GIVING. Like, my brain refuses to comprehend the 17k (basic) to 22k (max. Gvt hospital setting pa!) and even with benefits, that’s ABSURD! They’re devaluing a lot of things about our profession, our service, and our time. It’s insane!!

It’s not like pucho-pucho lang yung profession natin diba? Just like any other respectable profession, we grind for it. We broke every sane parts of ourselves and (barely) assembled it back after accomplishing our license. Imagine if they’d pay us 70k monthly, right? God won’t hear me curse every fiber of my being just to wake dafuq up. I’d get up with no alarms and probably even have my morning coffee SMILING.

We often hear about economic inflation but not so much on wage increase. How can we live comfortably and serve efficiently when every time we wake up at 5am in the morning, it already feels like we have a leash attached to our necks??! It makes me think if slavery were even abolish or it just involved all colors/all ethnicity??

How can I convince both of my parents to retire with a 17k monthly income when they earn more than me? That’s wild!

Our paychecks— it’s really insane (not in a good way).

1qvz8ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fotv/comments/1qvz8ck/this_shows_tribute_to_david_lynch/,This show’s tribute to David Lynch,"The first scene we see of Hank McClean this season has him putting on a suit, drinking some damn fine coffee and speaking in a retro dictaphone while a Roy Orbison song plays in the background. A tribute to Kyle MacLachlan’s famous David Lynch character Special Agent Dale Cooper from the TV show Twin Peaks.

And now with the season finale, we see Hank undergo a memory wipe from an electrical device, not unlike Dale Cooper/Dougie Jones in Twin Peaks The Return who underwent a memory wipe after passing through an electrical socket. And in both shows it happened in Vegas!

It’s interesting because the ones who underwent the procedure on Fallout were more alert and awake to their surroundings, but Hank seems more dazed and lost? He seems more dementia-like in the way that Dale Cooper/Dougie Jones was. Time will tell if Hank will remain in that Dougie Jones state of mind in season three.

Anyway, it’s just bittersweet from this David Lynch fan’s perspective that he passed away last year and yet it’s like Dale Cooper and Dougie Jones lives on. 😢

If any Fallout fan wants to check out Twin Peaks I highly recommend it. You get to see Kyle MacLachlan play a character as kind as Lucy, until season three that is. 🤫",4,1770235423.0,Fotv,2,1.0,False

1qvz6ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShawnaTheMom/comments/1qvz6ya/it_is_what_it_is_and_going_no_contact/,It is what it is and going no contact,"I am rewatching the Christmas storyline (anxiously awaiting the next drop from Shawna) and I wanted to talk more about the conversation between Shawna and John in Part 6 (after John has coffee with Frank and Jen). Specifically I wanted to provide my perspective on the situation as someone who is six years no contact with my father as well as currently going no contact with my mother. There are a lot of reasons I made these decisions that I'm not getting into, but emotional manipulation and abuse play a role which I bring up because they also play a role in John going no contact; so on a one-to-one scale I can relate to what he's going through. 

This is a bit of a rant, and I think to a certain extent a hot take, so feel free to share your own thoughts but please be nice (this subreddit is usually pretty nice but I have had a few interactions with people on TT and IG related to this which were really not so I do want to preface that I'm not trying to attack anyone who disagrees so please don't attack me).

I was inspired to make this post after reading the comments on the skit that were lowkey attacking John and I feel the need to not necessarily defend him but perhaps add additional context to those who haven't gone through this process. 

John opens up to Shawna that Frank is doing the same thing he always is, saying the right things but turning around and defending Barb when her actions are objectively indefensible. Shawna says, ""I'm sorry,"" to which John replies, ""It is what it is."" Shawna's next response is, ""Why do you do that? Do you want people to care about how you feel or not?""

I don't know about other people but that line really really upset me. I have done a lot of therapy and one of the things which I practice almost daily is acceptance that I cannot control or change other people, I can only control myself. ""It is what it is"" is an absolutely valid way to acknowledge something sucks and, to an extent, you cannot change that. Sure I can stop going around someone or call them out on their behavior, but I cannot force them to change and therefore have to accept the reality of the situation. 

This isn't a new concept to the Shawnaverse. In Part 8 of the Thanksgiving episode, Sam says she is able to cope with Nora's behavior through, ""radical self love and acceptance of reality,"" which she says means she has given up any hope Nora will ever change. ""It is what it is"" is a much more simple way to present the idea, but at the core I feel like they are the same message.

When I say ""it is what it is"" I am not dismissing my own hurt, I am acknowledging that I cannot change another person. I can only remove myself from the situation by going no contact (which John is actively doing with Barb and I get the vibe he's also starting that process with Frank after the Christmas Lights incident). I think it's entirely unfair to dismiss this very normal response as not wanting people to care about your feelings.

Granted, John has not handled the entire process of going no contact well at all and Shawna was deep in her grief and postpartum journey at the time. We can chalk it up to sadness and general hurt overwhelming the situation. But I do feel like John didn't get all the support he could've in the process of going through with no contact, which I can imagine made him less likely to open up about everything. It is a long process both leading up to going no contact and dealing with the emotional fallout. I still cry about the fact that my dad doesn't know I'm married because he wouldn't support my (gay) marriage and that last time we spoke was pre-COVID.

Given that John really started the process of going no contact after his anniversary and the infamous 'get out of my life' confrontation, it's been about a year where he gets to basically grieve the loss of a parent who is still alive. He had talked about going no contact with Barb previously which Shawna pivoted to an intervention, but until he actually told Barb to get out of his life he didn't really do any planning for the no contact. 

In Part 7 of Piper's birthday, he lays some pretty firm boundaries with Barb which is overheard by Moe (another no contact child - I think this encounter is only in the full video?). Moe (Mo?) tells him, ""Good job. I've been there, it's rough."" And when I think back I don't feel like I remember Shawna ever really having this same just general acknowledgement of his hurt and how hard it is. I wish we saw her support him in that way because when I was going through it, my friends telling me I was doing a good job actually meant a lot to me. 

I'm not trying to ignore that his shutting down was also a problem. He needed to take action and just didn't for several months despite his wife asking him to and the confusion it caused his children (Max especially being hurt by his inaction in the same way John is hurt by Frank's). I just think it's important to recognize there's a reason he's shutting down and his feelings/struggles are still valid even if he also has work he needs to do internally.

I also decided I might want to do one of those unnecessarily in depth recaps of the Shawnaverse because I enjoy making these analyses so if I am missing something please let me know. I'm eager to see other people's thoughts on this topic.",9,1770235329.0,ShawnaTheMom,2,1.0,False

I have been doing deliveries for uber for a month. It was an interesting journey(but not easy at all). I recieved 2 reports of missing orders in the first two weeks, but 0 since then. So I guess I was just unlucky. 

And more, I got 3 thumbs down in these two days! One customer complained that the order should be arrived 30 mins ago but I was still waiting in the restaurant at that time. Fine, I will just consider that ppl sitting at home won't understand the concept of ""constructions"" and ""rush hour"" in the morning. 

One down vote from merchant I don't know why, since I just go inside, show the name/code and verify and say thank you and leave. When we’d barely exchanged a few words—there wasn’t even much interaction—there couldn’t possibly have been any conflict. That downvote really came out of nowhere. But I did meet a really friendly staff member. I chatted with him for a bit, and he said he was going to give me a thumbs-up. That was pretty much the only longer interaction I had that day. Now I’m wondering if he accidentally hit the wrong button, or if he was just messing with me. 

The third one is because of damaged packaging. I don't know if the food were damaged but if looks like the coffee came out and damaged the bag. From outside it is just a little. Maybe plus a later delivery? That was a 5 CAD order so I accept another shopping order and two orders, 8 km, 1hour in total. 

Getting back on track, how worried should I be about my satisfaction rate right now? As you know, Uber’s rating system is really unfair—happy customers rarely leave a thumbs-up, but unhappy ones are very likely to give a thumbs-down. Right now, a single thumbs-down drops my rate by 2%.

At what point do people usually get deactivated—80%? Also, is Uber Eats Pro only useful for those perks/discounts?

The app shows that to keep Uber Eats Pro Diamond I need to stay above 93%. What happens if I drop below 93%—do I just lose Uber Eats Pro benefits, or do I lose Uber Eats Pro altogether, along with Diamond? 

This past month of delivering has made me realize that this job really offers no security at all. Restaurants and customers can rate you or report you however they want. Uber doesn’t provide any real help either—they just expect you to prove yourself, or they simply repeat the same scripted customer support lines. Maybe, out of the three parties involved, drivers are the easiest for Uber to exploit.",1,1770235271.0,UberEatsDrivers,1,1.0,False
1qvz5xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MachineGunBroker/comments/1qvz5xp/machinegunbroker/,MachineGunBroker,"They never had a real name for him. Just a file tag.

MGB

“The Machine Gun Broker.”

The FBI said he lived in Florida, but that didn’t narrow a thing down. Somewhere between palmettos and swamp heat, in a house that looked like it sold bait out front and lies out back. Rusted mailbox. American flag that never quite came down. Wi-Fi strong enough to reach the world.

MGB didn’t move guns the way movies show it—no crates, no forklifts, no docks at midnight. He moved connections. Paper trails that folded in on themselves. Shell companies that owned other shell companies, all registered to dead malls and shuttered tax offices.

If a war popped off in a forgotten corner of the globe, MGB already knew about it. Not from the news—news was late. He watched commodity spikes, encrypted chatter, shipping insurance anomalies. When diesel prices jumped in one country and tungsten orders spiked in another, he smiled.

That meant business.

He was friends with John McAfee—or at least the version of friendship that exists when two brilliant, paranoid men orbit each other like unstable moons. They met online first. Privacy forums. Crypto before it was cool. Long emails at 3 a.m. arguing about surveillance, governments, and whether freedom was something you built or something you escaped.

McAfee admired MGB’s logistics brain.

MGB admired McAfee’s chaos.

They met in person once, maybe twice. Nobody agrees on where. Some say Florida. Some say Belize. MGB always claimed it was “somewhere with bad coffee and worse intentions.”

From his Florida house, MGB ran everything. He never touched a gun. That was the rule. Touching made you real. Real got you caught.

Instead, he brokered:

	•	Old Eastern Bloc stockpiles “lost” after audits

	•	Brand-new rifles that fell off manifests mid-ocean

	•	Spare parts labeled as agricultural equipment

	•	Ammo shipped as “industrial fasteners”

He didn’t care who won wars. He cared that they continued.

Wars meant demand. Demand meant leverage. Leverage meant silence.

The FBI knew of him long before they knew him. Every time they pulled a thread, it led to a different country, a different language, a different dead end. The one constant was a Florida IP address that never stayed logged in long enough to subpoena.

They said if you ever met MGB, you wouldn’t know it. He’d look like a guy who complained about property taxes and knew too much about boat engines. The kind of man who fixed his own AC and never talked politics in public.

One day, the activity stopped.

No shipments rerouted. No strange insurance claims. No chatter spikes before conflicts. Just… quiet.

McAfee vanished into his own legend not long after. When asked about MGB once, he laughed and said,

“Smartest ghost I ever knew. If he existed.”

The Florida house still stands in the story. Windows dark. Mail piling up. Router humming to no one. But something keeps the bills paid. 

2026 starts a new chapter for the MGB. A change of scenery and advancement in technology has gifted new experiences beyond comprehension. A chapter of life that will define what it truly means to be anonymous and wildly successful. ",1,1770235270.0,u_MachineGunBroker,0,1.0,False

1qvz3fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1qvz3fl/autoimmune_issues/,Autoimmune issues,"So here’s my predicament. I have psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The arthritis is what I’m mostly doing this for, it’s been brutal the last few years. 

In May and June of last year, I did carnivore with whole milk and coffee, doing OMAD, mostly just steaks (I did include A1 sauce for first 4 weeks-ish) and within just 4-6 weeks I had probably 80%+ less pain and inflammation, and felt better mentally than I ever have….then I went on vacation in July and went straight back to eating SAD, within 2-3 weeks the inflammation came back and flared worse than before and lasted months. I’ve been addicted to junk food my whole life basically but I did manage to lose about 65 pounds on carnivore/fasting and have kept it off since.

Anyway, after months of yo-yoing on and off carnivore I finally got back on it at the end of December and haven’t seen nearly the same benefits in the same time frame. This time around I have included 5-6 eggs with my OMAD meal because I wasn’t able to eat enough when I was only consuming beef. I’m still having coffee and milk as well. I also just went through a cross country move and fell off carnivore for the last 10 days but I’m starting a 72 hour fast today to get myself back on track. 

So I guess my question is, has anyone noticed something similar with their inflammation levels and/or mental health? Maybe it’s the eggs that are causing my inflammation to stay high? The only difference between this run and last year when I saw an 80%+ improvement is that this time around I added eggs. I know dairy isn’t great but it’s helping me stay on track better in the early goings and it didn’t seem to hold me back last year from dropping inflammation, and I’ll cut it out as soon as I can trust my food decisions a bit more… I have also been pretty stressed out lately and I know that’s having some effect.

1qvz33s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_megerachrysanthemum/comments/1qvz33s/customer_who_comes_in_and_farts_the_whole_time/,Customer Who Comes In And Farts The Whole Time,"Okay so I work at a coffee shop/bookstore and we have a customer who regularly comes in and passes gas the entire time he is here. The first time he came in to the store my coworkers and I just thought this customer just had bad gas that day (cause who doesn’t once in a while) But every time since then, he comes in, sits at our long community table, pretends to read, and farts. It gets so bad my coworkers and I have to refrain from audibly gagging at the smell. We have begun to wonder if this is a kink thing. If he gets off on farting in public and the reactions of others to him passing gas. Most recently he came in and purchased a new book, I was at the register and wanted to make the transaction as quick as possible because it was just a constant wave of disgusting gas hitting my nose over and over again. I had to hold my breath. And I swear he was trying to make the transaction as long as possible because he fumbled around in his wallet for a while and the first card he used declined. When the transaction was completed I had to step away to another part of the store to breathe. Later that same evening my coworkers and I witnessed him standing behind a customer seated at our long table, pretending to look at the merchandise on the shelf whilst presumably farting on the poor girl just trying to do her work. Not an hour later he got up from the table again to this time stand behind another customer seated at the long table and while pretending to look at the books on the shelf, passing gas right into this girls space. She eventually got fed up with him and got up and left in a rush. She definitely seemed angry and uncomfortable. This feels like borderline sexual harassment. My coworkers and I have even caught him digging in his pants, shifting in his seat, staring at us or other customers and even rubbing his nipples at times. Our boss does not see this as a big deal and said “we can’t ban someone for farting.” Despite this customer making our entire staff uncomfortable and even costing us business now that he his farting as lead to customers leaving because of the smell. He comes in at least once a week or every other week. We don’t know what to do and we’re angry and frustrated that our boss does not care or want to take action in any way. I guess I’m just wondering if any one else has had to deal with creeps like this or ideas for what to do.

### 🐶 What’s the ONE Dog Training Tip That Actually Worked for You?

I still remember the exact moment it clicked for me — my dog wasn’t being *stubborn*, he was just *confused*.  

Pulling on the leash, ignoring commands, barking at shadows…  
I kept thinking he was misbehaving when, in reality, **I was sending all the wrong signals**.

That moment seriously changed how I see dog training — it’s not about dominance or control. It’s about **clarity, trust, and calm leadership**.  

Once I shifted my mindset, everything changed:
- Walks stopped feeling like a battle  
- He actually looked to me for direction  
- The house became *crazy* peaceful  

Simple truth?  
> Most “bad” behavior isn’t bad — it’s just unclear communication.  

That realization eventually led me to build something a little bigger than just tips and trial-and-error.

and i became distracted. granted, i haven't been the most productive (i just got sidetracked and started writing this right now) but this girl is on my mind CONSTANTLY. 

we're just friends right now. i know; ""here it comes"" you all say in your heads.. but here goes...

she's my type. i don't think i'm her type. but we had our first hangout outside of the class we share at college, over some dinner last night. initially she asked if i wanted to get a coffee with her but my classes didn't work for that time. 

anyway, i called it a date, said suggestive stuff a bunch, she didnt seem to mind it thankfully, even laughed a few times. so at one point i was like okay so next time, can it be a ""date date""? 

and she said maybe, but that she wasnt ready for anything because of a bad breakup a bit ago. 

we ended up connecting on a lot of things, which im not sure if this is the bpd speaking and idealizing or we actually do have a ton in common. i mean we both are studying similar things for career paths, both are artists, we have the same kind of humor, we both have bpd, ptsd, colorful pasts, are both into fashion and romance, are into dark psychological horror, and are hard lovers. she brought up how there was a void that only a romantic partner could fill and that she was always trying to fill it for a long time... which is literally me... 

okay so here's my struggle. i was fine, i wasn't that attached before last night. i've been idealizing though ever since. she clearly knows im into her since i let her borrow my water bottle, asked where she drank from out of curiosity (since she wanted a bit of my food but cut off the place i bit earlier) and she told me and asked if i was going to drink from that spot lol. 

she doesn't seem to be UNINTERESTED but i don't want to dwell on the possibility of it going my way. she said she doesn't want to force anything and whatever happens happens. i have no idea how to understand that. i guess because my feelings are usually ""all in"" or ""nothing"". 

i just need help. i keep fantasizing about the things we'd do on dates and stuff. but we're probably nowhere near that and i know it. i know i need to detach. i just want to do that as best as i can right now... i need to focus and i want to have my priorities straight. i hate being so attached so soon, its always just destructive one way or another ",3,1770234668.0,BPD,1,1.0,False

You drink the coffee, block the adenosine receptors, and feel good for 90 minutes. But you’re really just borrowing energy from later in the day. When it wears off, the adenosine floods back in, and the crash hits harder (see the video).

I wanted to stop fighting my own biology, so I switched to a stack focused on Lion’s Mane and Alpha Lipoic Acid. The goal was to support actual ATP production (cellular energy) rather than just whipping the brain to work harder.

The difference in my afternoon workflow has been night and day. Sustained focus, zero jitters, and no ""brain fog"" at 4 PM.

(I formulated this specific stack myself called MindBoost because I wanted clinical dosages, but even if you don't use mine, I highly recommend looking into Lion's Mane over just adding another espresso shot).",2,1770234648.0,LLEatwell,2,1.0,False

I posted my first attempt here many months ago and had some wonderful people help out so I am once again asking for your feedback (I am on my knees) before I start looking for beta readers and re-entering the query trenches eventually. The plot and character names have changed slightly since my first attempt, so I want to make sure this new one is working.

Thank you in advance for any feedback or advice!

\---

Dear \[Agent\],

I would like to submit for your consideration FOUR PRIMARY COLOURS, a multi-POV literary novel complete at 77,000 words. Examining the implications of South Korea’s patriarchal ethos, reminiscent of *Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982* by Cho Nam-Joo, it features intertwined narratives of womanhood and biculturalism as seen in Hanako Footman’s *Mongrel*, and the blurring of realities similar to *Audition* by Katie Kitamura.

Two years into her new life amongst Auckland's elite, an unexpected email awakens Seol's dormant university inbox: an enquiry about a sapphic surrealist painting. As a software engineer far removed from the world of art, she chooses to ignore it—until someone begins to follow her home. Known as Nana, she's certain only Seol can help find a person named Lily because, despite pretending otherwise, they both know it’s who the email was addressed to.

Lily has been Nana's other half since childhood, with whom she shares almost everything: toothbrushes, girlfriends, email passwords. It’s at university where their paths diverge for the first time as Nana, a meek middle child, resigns to a future of medicine and men to appease her immigrant mother; Lily, an outspoken lesbian and cultural rebel, remains determined to prosper as a digital artist. Slowly peeled apart by their growing contrast, Nana turns around one day to realise Lily has vanished altogether.

Emboldened to find her, what begins as Seol's replies to the email and surreptitious sketches in her husband's absence soon starts to bleed her suppressed past into her carefully constructed future. But she isn't the only one with secrets. When a shocking admission from her husband threatens to crumble the life she has built altogether, she must reckon with what brought Nana to her, where Lily may be, and above all, her own connection to these two women—and whether the final image will be worth the price.

\[Bio\]

First 300 words:

Since its last correspondence almost a decade ago, it seems unlikely, this notification sitting unread in a long-retired inbox. Seol blinks. She refreshes the page with a furtive finger for the mirage to correct itself, in letters or lines or some other mosaic of code, but there it remains, unchanged. She clicks on it.

*I’m not sure if this will reach you, but I recently came across* Mouthwash *for the first time in a while*, reads the first line. Her eyes widen as they traverse the sentences, and again when she glances at the name of the addressee, ‘Lily’, two syllables tasting foreign in her mouth. At the end of the succinct email from an unrecognised address is the name ‘Synne’. Upon checking the date it was sent, she becomes newly aware of a constriction behind her ribs, something gathering her chest like cloth.

Rhythmic footsteps descend from the floor above before she can examine further. Immediately she closes the tab, allowing the travel itinerary she’s been working on this month to fill the screen, and she also opens the weekly weather just in case, forecasting cloudy skies with chances of rain for Auckland Central. She smoothens the shape of her hair. Jun smiles when their eyes meet: him at the foot of the stairs, her at the dining table with her spine straining upright.

‘You’re up early,’ he says as he ambles to the kitchen.

‘I just thought I’d get an early start on planning our trip.’ She shuts her laptop slowly, inconspicuously, before rising to her full height. ‘What would you like for breakfast?’

‘I’m not hungry right now, but I could do with some coffee.’

1qvyqvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1qvyqvg/marigolds_part_2_of_2/,Marigolds (Part 2 of 2),"At 12:30 I got the call I’ve been waiting for. Daria’s voice radiated from the phone, she sounded so excited, so happy.

“Ok James, you better get your things in order, I’m leaving for the clinic ok.” She giggled “Don’t you flake on me this time.” Then her voice softened a bit “Please come this time.”

Dad, just like I thought, let me go. He put his hands on my shoulders firmly, giving me this fake serious expression.

“Son, I’m going to fire you if you don’t bring me pictures, last time I had to beg Daria for them.”

I pulled into the parking lot at 12:50. The clinic was empty; the only cars that were there were staff.

I walked through the door, a chime accompanying my entrance. I stated my name and who I was here for. A nurse—I think—ushered me in.

The ultrasound room was colder than I expected—small, windowless, lit only by the dull glow of a computer screen. A plastic bottle of clear gel sat next to the keyboard like a condiment on a diner table. The exam bed was draped in thin, crinkly paper that rustled every time Daria moved.

She lay back slowly, belly exposed, the rest of her half-covered with a hospital sheet that barely reached her knees. The technician—a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and no visible interest in small talk—squeezed the gel onto Daria’s stomach. It glistened under the soft overhead light.

Then came the wand.  
 She pressed it down—not painfully, but firm. Still Daria flinched.

The screen flickered—grey static, then shadows swimming.

A curve. A twitch. A ripple of movement.

“There’s the heartbeat,” the tech said gently.

Then the sound filled the room. Fast. Watery. Mechanical. Like a horse galloping underwater. It made my skin crawl.

Daria squeezed my hand. “You hear that, James?” she whispered, smiling.

But I wasn’t looking at her.

The image was wrong.

At first, it looked like a baby’s head—but then the skull **bulged outward**, pulsing as if something inside was pushing to get out.

From the spine, **long black cords** extended—slick, rope-like, **moving**. Not waving. **Reaching**. One uncoiled and brushed the edge of the screen.

Another pulsed from the abdomen—**thicker than the legs**, like a root burrowing into the flesh from the inside.

My body locked. I couldn’t breathe. My hand twitched in Daria’s, but she didn’t look at me.

“He’s really growing,” she giggled. “He’ll be as big as us someday.”

I stared at the screen, bile rising in my throat.

Then—**blink.**

The image was normal again.

A baby. Just a baby. Soft skull. Normal limbs. Perfect little heartbeat.

Then the tech hit a button. The image vanished.

Daria beamed. “That was amazing.”

I just nodded, still gripping her hand, my palm ice-cold.





Ever since that morning, the thing hasn’t stopped watching.

At night, it waits in the bedroom corner.

During the day, it stands beside the front door—silent, still, always there.

I pass it every time I come home.  
 I don’t look at it anymore.  
 I hear it whispering when I close my eyes—sharp, venomous syllables in a language I can’t begin to understand.  
 They rattle in my skull like static.

Sleep is a joke now.  
 Work’s worse than ever. I’ve been moved to the prep station just to keep up with the flood of orders. Bills are stacking, and the real estate deal I need to close keeps slipping further away. I’ve even thought about asking Dad for help.  
 But all of that… faded when I opened the front door that night. It was the Monday after Daria’s ultrasound.

The box with the crib was sitting in the nursery.  
 Daria was painting clouds on the baby-blue walls, her brush moving slow and steady.

She turned as I stepped in. “Oh! I didn’t know you’d be home so early.”

I held up the pizza box. “It’s six o’clock. Figured I’d pick up dinner.”

She smiled. “That actually sounds amazing right now.”

I pointed at one of the clouds. “That one does not look anything like a cloud.”

It looked more like a blob than a nice soft cloud.

She pouted. “I’ve never been an artist, and it’s not like the baby’ll care.”





Dinner was quiet in the best kind of way.  
 The thing didn’t appear. The kitchen felt warm again—like it used to. I honestly couldn’t even taste the pizza.

Daria sat across from me, still in her paint-streaked clothes, eyes soft and glowing in the evening light.  
 The sunlight poured through the window, catching her hair—it looked like fire paused mid-flicker.

She caught me staring. “Jamie,” she said, tilting her head.

“Yeah?”

“What are you looking forward to most?”  
 She rested her chin in her hand. “About the baby, I mean.”

I thought for a second. “Family dinners,” I said finally. “Us at the table. All of us. Just... eating together. When he’s older, of course.”

She smiled like she was already there, watching it happen.

“I’m looking forward to taking care of him,” she said softly.  
 “The house is so quiet sometimes. I can’t wait for it to be messy and loud and alive. I want to hear little feet on the floor.”  
 She placed her hand on her belly and laughed gently. “He’s kicking again. I think he knows we’re talking about him.”

I stood and moved around the table, crouching beside her. “Really?”

She took my hand and guided it to her stomach. A few seconds passed—and then I felt it: a firm, tiny nudge beneath the skin. Like a heartbeat you could touch.

My lips curled into a smile I didn’t have to think about. “Still feels like a muscle twitch to me.”

She laughed. “Don’t ruin the magic, James.”

I kissed the side of her belly. “Okay. That one was a ninja kick.”

She beamed, running her fingers through my hair. “We still need a name.”

I nodded. “I know. Feels like we’re behind.”

She looked off, thoughtful. Then her eyes found mine again. “Honestly? I like James Jr.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Really?”

She nodded. “I like the way it sounds. And it means I get to call him Junior. That just feels right, you know?”

She grinned. “Can’t wait to chase him around the house yelling it.”

I laughed with her. I really did. For a moment, it was like none of it mattered—not the exhaustion, not the dreams, not the bills. Just me, her, and the baby we were waiting on.  
 But the moment didn’t last. It never can.





The thing won’t leave me alone anymore.

It follows me now. Not just at home. Not just in dreams.

At work, it stands in the back corner of the freezer—just far enough into the shadows that the frost doesn’t touch it. I see it when I turn around, after grabbing a box of sausage patties or hash browns. Just… standing there. Watching.

It never moves. But every time I turn my back, I swear I feel it leaning forward. Like it’s *considering* something.

At the firm, it’s stationed beside the coffee machine. Mary thinks I’m lazy. She keeps giving me this puzzled look every time I ask her to pour my cup. I can’t explain it to her. 

It’s back by the front door at home, too. Same place as always. Still as furniture. Just part of the layout now.

I’ve stopped reacting. If I don’t acknowledge it, maybe it won’t do anything. Maybe it just wants to be seen. Maybe it already *knows* everything.

I’m not sleeping. Not really. I rest in fragments now. Fifteen minutes here. Maybe an hour on the couch if I’m lucky. I’ve been getting up earlier just to get ahead of it. 4:30 a.m., every morning. McDonalds opens at five. I try to be there before it notices I’m gone.

I’m starting to feel like a robot. Just going through the same motions every day. I can’t tell if I’m even exhausted.

The only upside is the money. With how much I’ve been working, I’ve finally pulled ahead. Two real estate deals closed last week—$7,000 sitting in my account. It’s the most I’ve had in years. Enough to cover the hospital. Enough for the next two months of bills. Enough to maybe even buy Daria something nice.

But none of it feels real. It’s just numbers.

Daria’s due soon.





**Sunday, I took an extra shift at McDonald’s.**  
 Daria looked disappointed when I told her.

Still, I managed to finish the crib. Daria got the nursery painted.

It’s strange, standing in that room now — soft blue walls, clouds near the middle, faintly cartoonish. It feels so… nice, in there. I even helped with the ceiling — stuck glow-in-the-dark stars to it, so when it's bedtime, it looks like a night sky frozen in time.

This morning, I caught Daria just standing there — arms crossed, hands on her hips, scanning the room like a commander surveying a battlefield. Every now and then, she’d adjust something. A stuffed animal. A mobile. A blanket corner. Then step back. Then forward again.

She’s adorable when she’s like that.

But the moment I got to work, the feeling curdled.

The thing had moved.

It stood dead center in the lobby — out in the open now, waiting for me behind the register.

It stared through me.

Its tentacles stretched slowly outward, crawling up the walls, spilling across the ceiling like roots. The air felt thick — humid, oppressive. Like standing in a jungle that had long since rotted.

The smell hit next: mold and something older, something wet and dead.

And still, no one noticed.

Customers stepped on the tendrils, slick and pulsing. I heard them squish underfoot. A kid leaned against the wall, I watched a strand of black slime fall down and soak into his hair — thick and glistening.

He didn’t flinch.

His parents kept eating.

I made it through the shift. Barely. By the end, I couldn’t feel my fingers. My legs moved without me.

I almost ran out the door.

My phone rang as I reached the car.

I climbed inside, hands shaking, and answered.

“James?” Daria’s voice crackled through the phone, slightly alarmed.

“Yes?” I responded.

“Your parents are coming over. They just called and said they’d be over in 30 minutes.” She explained.

“What!” I half yelled into my phone. “No notice, no nothing?”

“I know, I was just about to get in the bath.” She continued. “Do you want me to just order some pizza? I mean that’s what we always have, I don’t have time to cook them lunch.”

I sighed. “Yeah, that’d be fine. Order the bigger, more expensive pizzas. I'll bill it to Dad. Dad likes Meat Lovers, and Mom likes pineapple, uhh, nevermind — get her cheese and we’ll keep it.”

She giggled. “Alright, at least we’ll get something out of it.”

I hung up, still staring at the empty passenger seat.

Traffic was worse than I expected. It took me thirty-five minutes to get home.

Dad’s big, showy SUV was parked crooked in the driveway, taking up most of it and leaving Daria’s car awkwardly squeezed in. I had to reverse back out and park on the street just to avoid boxing them in.

When I walked inside, my parents and Daria were already gathered at the table, chatting. Four oversized pizza boxes sat stacked in the middle like a makeshift centerpiece.  
 She’d really ordered the expensive ones — probably twelve bucks each.

“Well, look who finally showed up,” Dad bellowed from across the room.

I scanned the house. No sign of the thing.

“James, why haven’t you called your mother?” Mom was already up, arms open, pulling me into a hug.

She smelled like expensive lotion and wine. Her long blond hair hadn’t grayed yet — always perfectly brushed. In her mid-fifties, but she still dressed like she was on her way to a charity gala. And that expression — vaguely disappointed, like she was reviewing a hotel room she didn’t book.

Over her shoulder, Daria caught my eye.  
 We shared the same look: *Really?*

“You look exhausted,” Mom said, brushing her fingers across my cheek. “Are you even sleeping?”

I pulled back, gently. “Been working a lot.”

Her silence demanded more.

“My insurance isn’t great. I want to have enough saved for the birth,” I added.

She gave a tight nod, but her eyes kept scanning my face like she was still looking for something to fix.

“So,” Dad said, rising with a grunt and wiping his hands on a napkin, “where’s my grandson going to be staying? I’m not paying for this pizza until I see it.”

I pointed upstairs, but he was already moving. Daria followed, probably to keep him from poking into the wrong room.

Before I could follow, Mom placed a manicured hand on my shoulder.

“You could’ve done better than pizza, James,” she said, voice clipped.

I turned. “You gave us thirty minutes’ notice. What did you expect, a five-course meal?”

“Pizza just… doesn’t reflect status,” she replied, as if that explained anything. Then she swept past me and headed upstairs.

That’s always been Mom. More concerned with appearances than effort. She’s never worked a day in her life, but you’d think she ran a Fortune 500 company the way she talked about “presenting well.”

I followed them upstairs.

The nursery door was open.

**And there it was.**  
 The thing stood at the end of the hallway, etched in shadow.  
 Its tentacles hung like vines — draping from the ceiling, crawling along the floor, weaving across the walls. But they all **stopped** just short of the nursery doorway.

I stepped into the nursery, calm on the outside, skin crawling beneath.

“Whoa,” Dad said, craning his neck to look up. “You even did the stars on the ceiling. Do they glow?”

“They do,” Daria said proudly. “James put them up.” She looked down at her belly and added with a laugh, “I’m… not tall enough.”

Mom stood near the bookshelf, smiling with polite approval. “You’ve really created a lovely space for Junior.”

Daria beamed. “I know, right? We worked so hard on this. James built the furniture, and I painted and decorated. It took forever. I wish we’d done it earlier — before I got so… round.”

She walked them through every piece of it — the crib, the clouds, the night-sky ceiling. Her voice was light, full of pride and love. For a moment, it felt like all the bad things were far away.

I stood by the door, nodding occasionally, eyes flicking back to the hallway.

The thing didn’t move.

Eventually, we filtered back downstairs.



The living room lights were too bright. The air felt too still. And the pizza smelled off — greasy and sharp, like cardboard soaked in salt. I chewed through a slice without tasting it, nodding along to whatever conversation my parents were having. But my mind was still upstairs.

Would the thing turn our house into another jungle, like it did McDonald’s? Would the walls start sweating, the floors pulse underfoot, the air grow thick and wet and moldy?

I flinched at the thought.

“James?” My mother’s voice cut through the fog.

I blinked. Everyone was staring. Even Daria.

“James, yoo-hoo. Earth to James,” Dad said, waving a hand in front of my face with a chuckle.

“Sorry.” I shifted in my chair. “Spaced out.”

Daria gave me a concerned glance.

“Well,” Mom said, brushing a napkin across her lips, “we’re heading to Florida next week. A little early spring break. You two should come.”

Dad jumped in. “We’ll cover it — the flights, hotel. Everything.”

He meant **he** would. My mother had never paid for anything but Botox and judgment.

Daria hesitated. “Elizabeth, I’d love to, but… I don’t think I can. The baby could come any time now. The doctor said we should be on alert.”

“You’re at 32 weeks, right?” Dad asked, squinting.

“Thirty-six,” she corrected, more gently than I would’ve.

I cleared my throat. “And with hospital bills, I need to pick up more hours.”

Mom let out a tight, irritated sigh — the kind that could cut drywall.

“I suppose that’s a no, then,” she said, her tone flat but pointed.

I nodded. “Yeah. Sorry. It’s just bad timing.”

Dad draped an arm around her shoulder. “Hey, it’s fine. No pressure. Next time.”

There was an awkward silence after that. Just the sound of crust crunching and someone’s chewing. I glanced over at Daria — she looked a little stunned, but she shrugged and leaned forward to grab another slice.

Eventually, they stood to leave. Mom offered a stiff goodbye hug. Dad slapped my back and told me to “keep grinding.” They left the leftover pizza.

I stood in the doorway watching their SUV pull away, the tail lights glowing red in the dimming sky.

Daria joined me, folding her arms across her chest.

“I’m starting to get sick of pizza,” I muttered.

She laughed softly. “I’m not. Still my favorite.”

We stood there a while, not saying anything. Just the hum of the fridge and the ticking clock.



Daria was still standing in the entryway, arms crossed. Her hair was caught in the overhead light, glowing faintly orange. She shifted, hesitating.

“James… does your mom dislike me?” she asked, softly.

I turned to her. She wasn’t angry. Just small. Like the question had been sitting in her chest all night and finally found its way out.

“No,” I said quickly. “Daria, she just… you know how she is. My mom’s too concerned with how things *look*. That’s her whole deal. Don’t take it personally.”

She nodded, but didn’t look relieved.

“I just…” She rubbed one arm with the other. “I want both to like me. My parents don’t even want to see me.”

She looked down. Her voice dropped a bit. “I called them a couple days ago. Told them they’d have a grandchild soon.”

I stayed quiet.

“They wanted me to go to college,” she continued. “And as they put it, *‘do something with your life.’* Like creating a new one doesn’t count.”

Her shoulders slumped, Her expression falling.

“Is that normal?” she asked, barely above a whisper.

“No,” I said, stepping closer. “That’s not normal at all. It’s cruel. They’re losing the best part of their lives.”

She nodded again, but slower this time.

I tried to soften the air. “Don’t worry about my parents, okay? They like you. You should’ve seen my mom when I told her you were pregnant—it actually knocked her out of her ‘ice queen’ routine. She and Dad were literally jumping for joy. I’ve never seen them do that. Ever.”

That earned a small smile. Just a twitch at the corners of her mouth, but it was enough.

I flopped onto the couch with a sigh and grabbed the remote. The living room was dim except for the amber spill of light from the kitchen and the pale blue flicker of the TV screen coming to life.

Daria eased down beside me. Her hands rested on her stomach.

“I mean, I have you,” she said, gently. “So it’s all good.”

She laughed—not forced. Just tired and soft. “I can’t wait for the baby.”

I turned on some dumb Hallmark movie.

“Oh I bet, he’s pretty heavy,” I joked.

She looked jokingly taken aback then poked my cheek. “You know, James, most people are more excited about the *birth* of their child than just its *physical weight.*”

I shrugged, smiling. “Yeah, though he’s probably heavy. Especially today. Almost seems like he’s lower down.”

She nodded, rubbing her stomach slowly. “He’s going to be a big guy. I can feel it.”

She leaned her head onto my shoulder, a content little breath slipping out of her.

“Probably gonna outgrow his dad,” I said. “Definitely his grandpa. He’s short.”

Daria giggled. “You’re not exactly a giant, James.”

“No,” I said, mock-sulking. “But I’m medium tall.”

We sat like that for a while—her head on my shoulder. The glow from the TV painted shifting light across the room.

Daria pointed at the screen. “I didn’t know we got these silly movies.”

She turned her head, squinting up at me. “You’re not *paying* for these, are you?”

I shook my head. “No. I don’t even have time to sit down and watch anything.”

She nodded, then grew quiet—her eyes tracking something across the carpet.

“Hey, James?” she asked, her voice soft.

“Yeah?”

“What do you think Junior’s favorite color will be?”

She looked down as she asked it, hands smoothing her belly like she was already trying to comfort him.

“Blue,” I said.

Daria furrowed her brow looking up again. “Why? You said that pretty fast.”

“Well... we painted his room blue. So, I mean... logic, right? Mine’s red because my race car bed as a kid was red.”

She smirked. “Fair. That’s a fair hypothesis.”

I looked at the screen. The movie was already halfway in. Some guy in a perfectly tailored suit was talking on two phones at once.

“Wanna watch the movie?” I asked. “Thirty bucks says the initial fiancé’s a rich guy who’s too busy for the female lead.”

“As long as it’s with you,” she said, resting her cheek against my shoulder again. “Sure.”

I wrapped my arm around her. It all felt so… warm.

Daria shifted, uncomfortable.

I looked at her to see what was wrong, but she was focused on the movie.



The movie ended in the usual soft-focus blur—kisses, confessions, everyone conveniently happy. Daria stretched, yawning, and glanced at the clock.



“Oh. It’s already six o’clock,” she said with mock disappointment. “I’m guessing it’s bedtime for you.”

“Yep,” I said, standing with a groan. “Big breakfast planned. Extravagant, within our means.”

“Leftover pizza?” she teased.

“Nope. I bought the expensive bacon. We’re celebrating thirty-seven weeks.”

She blinked. “It’s thirty-six weeks.”

I laughed. “Got my weeks messed up. I realized when you told dad earlier.”

She lightly smacked my arm, half-smiling. “James, you can’t be forgetting that kind of thing.”

“I’ve got a lot on my mind,” I said. “Guess I’ll have to carry you to bed as penance.”

“Oh, so now we’re romantic,” she said, grinning.

“Just making up for lost time.”

I scooped her into a princess carry, slow and steady.

“You know you’re heavy,” I muttered as I shifted my grip.

She narrowed her eyes, amused. “James, if you want this to be your only child, keep talking.”

“Honestly, between my mouth and my jobs, we’re probably maxed out anyway.”

She laughed—real and bright. “With time, James. With time.”

I started up the stairs.  
 The thing was in the hallway.  
 Its limbs were still. Tentacles curled tight against the ceiling beams, pulling slightly farther away.  
 I didn’t look at it long.

I carried Daria past without speaking. The monster didn’t move.

I laid her gently on the bed. She giggled as I pulled the covers over her and kissed her forehead.

“Love you, James,” she mumbled, already sinking into the pillows.

“Love you too,” I said, settling down beside her.

Her warmth met mine in the quiet.

She shifted a little, one arm draped across my chest. The house was still—no pipes creaked, no cars passed, no distant sirens. Just the faint hum of the fridge downstairs and her breathing, deepening by the second.

The room felt... soft. Like it was holding its breath.

I pulled her close.

And drifted off.





I was in the field again.

The marigolds shimmered under starlight—  
 but the grass was gone.  
 Only dirt now.  
 Dry, cracked, and dark as ash.

The stars overhead burned brighter than I remembered.  
 Sharper. Hungrier.  
 And the sky—  
 darker somehow, though it was full of light.

I turned to face the moon—  
 but the moon was gone.

In its place hung the shattered corpse of a planet, fractured like broken glass, the pieces frozen mid-collapse.

A sudden weight pressed into my arms.  
 I looked down.

It was a baby.  
 But not.

Tentacles curled from its skull—short, underdeveloped things, limp across my forearms like damp seaweed.  
 Its skin was gray, veined with faint pulses of sickly violet.  
 Rotted in places, soft in others.  
 Still warm.

Its arms reached for me, weak but eager.  
 Its legs kicked gently, like it was happy.

There was no malice in it.  
 Only motion.  
 Only need.

The air was cool and clean.  
 Almost peaceful.  
 The thing shivered.

Then came the sound—a thin, high-pitched squeal, shrill and slurred.  
 I flinched.

But didn’t let go.

It made the sound again—closer to a giggle now.  
 Then:  
 “Dada.”

Distorted—garbage-slick and wrong. But unmistakable.

 It had no face, no mouth, no breath—only writhing tentacles where lips should be.  
 Still, it spoke.

“Dada.”

And again.  
 Softer. Pleased.  
 Happy.

Something inside me trembled.  
 Not fear.  
 Something else.

Warmth?

For a second—only a second—I swore I heard Daria’s laugh buried in its voice.  
 Warped. Twisted. Like a cassette tape melting in the sun.  
  


 This was mine?

I was holding my baby?  
 The thought came fast, uninvited.  
 Part of me screamed.  
 This thing—this impossibility—it was mine.

Then came the scream.

From behind me.  
 Inhuman. Enraged.

The wind rose.  
 Cold. Furious.

I curled the baby tighter in my arms, shielding it with my body.

Then—  
 a wet touch around my ankle.  
 A tendril.  
 Slippery. Hungry. Rising.

Before I could move, it yanked me down.





I woke with a start.  
 Labored breath. The feeling of something wet.

The clock read 3:12 a.m.

I sat up fast and turned to Daria.

She was hunched over, gripping her stomach, her face pale and tight.  
 “James,” she whispered. “I think I’m in labor.”

She winced, one hand bracing against the mattress, the other reaching for me.  
 “It started a while ago,” she said, her voice strained. “Ten minutes apart. Then seven. Now five.”

Her fingers dug into my arm as another wave hit. She hissed through her teeth.  
 “It’s not stopping, James.”

I looked down. The sheet beneath her was damp—just enough to darken the fabric.  
 “I think my water broke,” she murmured. Her eyes didn’t leave mine.

“Okay. Let’s get your stuff. Can you walk?”  
 She nodded.

I dressed fast, yanking my phone off the charger and leaving the cord behind. I helped her out of bed, steadying her with one arm around her waist.

The night air was cold as I guided her to the car.

I helped her into the front seat, reclined it slightly, and pulled the seatbelt across her lap. Her breath hitched again as she closed her eyes through another contraction.

“You’re doing great,” I said, not sure if it was true.

I climbed in, jammed the keys into the ignition. The car dinged at me like it didn’t know what was happening.

I should’ve called ahead.

But I didn’t.

I just drove.

The streets were empty.





I pulled into the small circle in front of the ER entrance. No valet. No one outside. Just the buzz of a flickering overhead light.

I threw the car into park and hopped out, rushing around to open her door. Daria’s eyes were half-closed, her hands gripping the seatbelt like a rope. Her breathing had gone shallow and rhythmic, like she was counting something only she could hear.

“Can you walk?” I asked, already unbuckling her.

She nodded, jaw clenched. “Let’s go.”

I helped her out, one arm around her back. She leaned into me hard—half her weight on my shoulder—and we shuffled through the automatic glass doors.

Inside, the air was too bright. Too clean. A front desk sat under blue LED lights, empty except for a lone nurse typing something into a terminal.

She looked up.

“Hi, she’s—my wife’s in labor,” I stammered. “Thirty-six weeks. Water broke.”

The nurse stood instantly. “Let’s get you into triage.”

She hit a button. Another set of doors hissed open. A second nurse appeared, pushing a wheelchair.

Daria tried to wave it off. “I’m okay,” she said, weakly.

But she sat.

The nurse wheeled her fast down a long, silent hallway. I kept pace beside them, phone clutched in my hand, heart knocking against my ribs like it wanted out.

We turned through a side corridor and into a narrow exam room. Low bed. Machines. Plastic curtain pulled halfway across the tile floor. A blood pressure cuff hung limp from the wall.

“Hospital gown’s on the chair. Change as much as you can. I’ll be back to check dilation,” the nurse said.

She left without fanfare. Like this was just another Tuesday night.

I helped Daria out of her coat. Her nightgown stuck to her skin where the fluid had soaked through. She didn’t say much—just moved slow, steady, like her whole body was trying to stay calm for the baby.

She eased onto the bed. I sat beside her.

“You’re doing good,” I said, softly.

She looked over at me, eyes heavy. “It hurts a little. But I can take it.”

The nurse came back. She slipped on gloves, asked Daria to breathe deep, and checked her.

“Five centimeters,” she said, almost pleased. “You’re in active labor. Everything’s looking good. We’ll admit you now.”

She smiled at Daria. “Baby’s ready.”

Daria tried to smile back. It didn’t quite land. But it was close.





We moved into a private delivery room fifteen minutes later.

Dimmer lights. A window showing the dark parking lot outside. One monitor beeped softly in the corner, tracking the heartbeat of something still inside her. IV tubes coiled gently from the stand beside the bed. The air smelled faintly like antiseptic and lavender-scented soap.

I sat in the chair next to her. Held her hand.

“I can’t believe this is happening,” she said, eyes up at the ceiling.

“I know,” I whispered. “But you’ve got this.”

She looked over at me, then down at her belly. Her fingers moved slowly across the bump like she was already trying to say goodbye without knowing it.

“I can’t wait to meet him,” she said.

Her voice was soft. Whole.





Time blurred.

The nurse checked her again—eight centimeters.

Another contraction hit hard, and Daria clenched my hand so tightly I thought she might crush bone. Her breath came out in quick, shaking bursts.

“I want it over,” she whispered. “I just want him here.”

“You’re almost there,” I said. “You’re doing amazing.”

The nurse gave a quiet nod. “You’re doing great, Daria. Next one, we’ll start pushing.”

They adjusted the bed. Another nurse came in. The room shifted subtly—monitors, wires, gloves snapping on. Everything became sharper. Brighter.

Daria cried out—just once—as the next contraction hit. I wiped her forehead. Her fingers curled into the blanket.

“Okay, push with this next one,” the nurse said gently. “Deep breath. Push.”

She did.

Hard.

I watched her face twist—pain, focus, everything at once. Her free hand gripped the bed rail, knuckles white.

And then—

She stopped.

She blinked.

Her eyes widened like something inside her had come unfastened.

Her lips parted, breath hitching.

“James,” she whispered. “Something’s wrong.”

I stood.

Before I could speak, her whole body jerked.

For a second, everything stilled. She looked at me like she didn’t know who I was. Like she was slipping.

One of the machines spiked—then dropped.

The nurse's smile vanished. “Daria?”

Daria gasped, like the air had been yanked from her lungs.

Blood—too much—began spreading beneath her. The IV line thrashed as her arm went limp.

A strange sound came from her throat—wet, broken, like she was trying to speak underwater.

Then—

Alarms.

Everything blurred. One nurse hit the call button. Another shouted into the hallway. The OB team poured in like a flood.

A doctor was suddenly at her side. Orders flew fast.

“Vitals crashing—get the crash cart!”  
 “Push epi!”  
 “We need to get the baby out—now!”  
 “Possible AFE! Go!”

I was still holding her hand when they pried it from mine.

“Sir—you need to step out now.”

“No—I’m not—” I started, but they were already moving.

Someone gripped my shoulders and turned me toward the door.

“She’s in the best hands,” a voice said—maybe the nurse from before. “We’ll get you when we can.”

The last thing I saw was her face.

Still. Pale.

Eyes half-lidded.

Then the door slammed shut.





I stood alone in the hallway.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. A nurse ran past, pushing a cart. Far off, a vending machine hummed.

I wandered back into the waiting room.

Everything was motionless—except the clock. It ticked, loud and steady.  
 One minute became ten.  
 Ten became thirty.  
 Thirty blurred into an hour. Then two.

Then the door opened.

An older nurse stepped inside. Her voice was tired. “Are you James Carter?”

I nodded.

“We need you in one of the consultation rooms.”

I stood. My knees wobbled beneath me.

The nurse held the door open.

I followed.

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I clenched them into fists, but it didn’t help.

“Is… is she okay?” I asked. My voice cracked.

“We need to be in a private area,” she said gently.

We stepped into a small room. Cold, neutral walls. A single cheap chair sat waiting for me.

.

“We’re very sorry,” she began, her voice soft but professional. Detached. “Your wife, Daria, experienced a rare complication. Amniotic Fluid Embolism. We did all we could… but we lost both.”

I felt something inside me throb. Not pain. Not yet. Just... a pulse.

I nodded.

She hesitated. “Would you like to speak with someone?”

“No.”

“Would you… would you like to see them?”

A long pause.

“Yes.”

She led me through a side hallway. Into the bereavement room.

The scent of antiseptic hung in the air. Soft. Almost sweet.

I stepped inside.

Daria lay on the bed.  
 Still.  
 Her hair brushed over her shoulder, neatly combed. Her lips closed, no smudge of sleep. Her arms straight at her sides—not folded awkwardly under her like usual. Her skin pale, too even.  
 Her eyes closed.

She didn’t look like she was asleep.

And next to her, in a small bassinet, was James Jr.

His skin was soft pink.  
 His head bald.  
 His face scrunched, the way babies do when they’re new. But he didn’t move. No twitch, no stir, no tiny hiccup.  
 No breath.

I stepped forward.

I looked down.

And I picked him up.

He was cold.

I sat beside Daria. Dragged the stiff hospital chair across the tile until it touched the bed. I reached out and took her hand in mine.

It was cold, too.

“Look, Daria,” I whispered, my throat raw. “We did good. We… we did good.”

My voice broke.

I sat there.

The room was quiet, except for the hum of the hospital’s vents and the slow rasp of my own breathing.

Eventually, a different nurse came in holding a folder. She sat beside me, eyes fixed on the floor.

“Mr. Carter,” she said softly. “I’m sorry for your loss. But we need a few more things from you.”

She opened the folder. “These are the release forms for Daria and your baby. You can take your time. We’ll need the name of a funeral home before we can transfer them.”

“South Central,” I said.

She nodded. “We’re required to offer a memory packet—prints, a lock of hair. You don’t have to take it, but...”

I nodded again.

“And… would you like to request an autopsy?”

“Yes.”

She pointed at a page in the folder. “There are resources here, sir. People you can talk to if you need help. You’re welcome to stay a bit longer, or we can—”

“Thank you,” I said. “But I’m going home.”

I stood.

I placed Junior gently back into his bassinet. I looked at Daria one last time—memorized the lines of her face, the stillness in her shoulders, the hush in her chest.

Then I walked out.





The hospital lights brightened as I passed, The daytime lights flickering on.

The front doors opened.

The sky had begun to pale. A soft blue tint on the horizon. The streets were alive with early traffic—people going to work. Coffee cups. Breakfast wrappers. Headlights.

I climbed into the car. It was still parked where we left it, the passenger seat empty now.

I drove home.

The front door was still wide open.

I stepped inside and shut it behind me. The house was quiet. The folder thudded onto the kitchen table. A heavy, final sound.

Nothing moved.

The air felt... wrong. Like it was waiting…

I climbed the stairs.

Each one creaked under my weight.

I turned at the top, rounded the banister, and walked into the nursery.

The sky-blue walls. The cartoon clouds. The stars I’d stuck to the ceiling.

The little mobile turned lazily above the crib, catching the early sunlight. The light spilled across the room in soft beams.

And in the windowsill, set in a small clay pot, a single marigold bloomed.

Its petals glowed gold in the morning light.

I sank to the floor.

My knees hit the carpet. My body folded in on itself. I didn’t sob—not at first. Just breathed.

Then the first tear fell.

Then the second.

Then everything broke open.

A low, rattling noise slipped from my throat—half moan, half gasp. I curled tighter, hands over my head, arms wrapped around my ribs like I was trying to hold myself in.

I wept. Deep, wracking sobs that tore from my lungs and spilled into the quiet room.

I thought of her hand in mine. Cold.

I thought of our son. Still.

I thought of the stars on the ceiling and the clouds we painted badly, and how proud she was when she looked at them.

“Oh God,” I whispered. “Why…”

My tears soaked the carpet.  
 My breath shook.  
 And the marigold bloomed, untouched.

“Are you going in tomorrow?” Grant asked, the sound of clicking buttons as he furiously mashed the X button on his controller.

“I don’t know…” I replied, taking another sip from my beer and then a drag from my cigarette. I blew the smoke out my nose. “Think I can get away with another day off?”

Grant, wearing a black-faded shirt from some metal band, shrugged his shoulders. “I mean, you did get pretty fucked up. I think the sight of your face would lose them money at this point—not like that’s much different than usual.”

I picked up my pillow and, just as Grant went to perform a combo, threw it at the back of his head.

“**K.O,**” the announcer bellowed as his character lay dead on the floor.

“Dick,” Grant muttered. He turned and gave me an irritating smile.

“At least I’ve actually been in a fight before.” My mood soured for some reason. “You’d probably just shit your pants.”

Grant got up and turned off the TV. He picked up and threw the pillow back at me, causing me to drop my cigarette. I was losing far too many of those things.

“Gettin’ your ass kicked doesn’t count as a fight,” he replied.

It hurt my pride, but in hindsight, Grant was right. Getting absolutely rocked in an alleyway doesn’t make you Mike Tyson. “Whatever, man. Enjoy that comic I so painstakingly retrieved for you.”

“You’re a true hero…”

I shrugged and waved him away. Grant, content with his minor verbal victory, went to his room and turned off the kitchen light as he did, which also served the double-purpose of being my bedroom light. His door creaked annoyingly as it closed.

I picked up my still-lit cigarette off the ground and sighed when I saw the small burn-hole in the carpet. Looks like we were well on the way to losing that deposit.

I glanced towards the table and saw the silver amulet… The Dragons-eye, Ray had called it. Appearance-wise, it did not look cheaply made. I turned it over and saw no identifying features. No manufacturing dates or locations. Had to have been a second-hand shop. Etsy maybe? Still, whoever had made it had done a fine job. I turned it back over to see the eye of the dragon staring at me. I could have sworn it peered into my very soul.

“Probably worthless,” I muttered, and slid it back onto the coffee table. “Man, fuck this…”

I yawned and sent a text to Gary about how much pain I was still in… with my “three broken ribs” and all. A little white lie hurts nobody. I received a reply quickly that essentially said not to worry about it. Two solid days off work in a row. One more, and I would need to find those muggers and thank them.

I went to the kitchen and ransacked the fridge, quickly finding my prize. I broke off a small piece of an edible brownie… not enough to get fucked up, but just enough to drown out the shit; to get me in that happy place where nothing else mattered except the here and now.

True fucking bliss.

I found my headphones, put the earbuds in, and hit shuffle. I grabbed my pillow and threw it down on the couch, laying on top of it and kicking my feet up. I waited, listening to the music until the edible was in full-effect. I breathed a sigh of relief… free of the trials and tribulations of man.

Or simply—free of the bullshit!

Eventually, *Enter Sandman* from Metallica keyed up, and I closed my eyes, letting my spirit leave my body as I drifted into the nothingness. All those meaningless wants and dreams became nagging whispers at the back of my mind as I let the music engulf me…

*Now I lay me down to sleep*

*Pray the Lord my soul to keep*

*If I die before I wake*

*Pray the Lord*

*my soul*

*to take*

\*\*\*

“**Waketh, Fopdoodle,**” a voice called out from the unknown.

“What’s a fopdoodle?”

“**Thy portal is closing. Waketh!**”

“Eat a dick, I’m trying to sleep.”

A roar blasted into my mind like a cannon. “***Wake!***”

I opened my eyes to an intense scene. Right in the middle of my living room, a portal, around my height in size, floated just above the ground. All around the portal, the air looked… distorted. Wrong. As if waves of light struggled to escape its pull. The portal itself was pure-black, except for a small silver streak down its middle.

I sat up, my hands shaking and my mouth hanging wide open.

“**Lubber-wort! Clutch me or thine will be lost to the fabrics of the in-between.**”

I looked around to find who was speaking to me, and when I peered down into my lap, I saw the Dragons-eye amulet in all its silver glory. It looked… different. The silver sharper; the lines more distinct. It rippled as if made of liquid. The colorful eye in the middle now moved and flowed about, as if it were alive. It locked onto me.

“**Now thine see, for ye’ were blind. Taketh me, and I shall show thee the way.**”

“*Fuck!*” I yelled as I grabbed the amulet, throwing it across the room. It clattered as it slid out of my sight. “*Fuck, fuck, fuck,*” I muttered frantically as I rubbed my eyes.

Slowly, I opened them again, and the portal still stood in its eerie glory, still rippling the air in the room.

*Okay Ike, you’re just tripping balls. It must have been the brownie. Clearly, there was something else in it. It’s not real. This isn’t real.*

I looked at the portal again, and it still stood, humming in place, almost peaceful in that “the world is ending, make peace with your god” sort of way.

“Okay,” I said, speaking to myself. “I’m just having a trip… but maybe this could be a good thing? I don’t have work, so let’s just go with it. My mind wants to take me on a journey… that could be fun, right? *Right!*”

My words sounded desperate, even to me—the dictionary example of desperate even. I knew with sickening certainty that I was about to have a bad trip. But, like a cat with too many lives, I set the thought aside.

Forcing down the want to run and hide in Grant’s room, a thought I only entertained until I considered the ramifications of such an act, I cautiously stepped closer to the portal—

*And it was incredible!*

I could feel the power from it; the force it took to rip a literal hole in the universe. Even if it was just a hallucination created from my drug-addled mind.

*Why the fuck did Grant have this shit unlabeled?*

I felt an opposing pull from the portal. My eyes were drawn to the amulet that laid near the front door. I shrugged and walked towards it, carefully picking it up off the ground.

“**Dew-beater. Fopdoodle. Lubberwort,**” a deep-voice assaulted my mind with all manner of… insults?

“What the hell are you saying?” I replied out loud, but I had the feeling that the voice could read my thoughts.

“**Tarry,**” the voice replied, its words entering my head like the pounding of a bass drum.

I felt an invasion of my mind, as if someone pried at my brain with a crowbar… or a mallet.

As the pain subsided, it said, “***Moron*****! My words imply idiocy on thine part.**”

*“Then why didn’t you just say that?”* I forced the thought with all the brainpower I had, willing my mouth to stay closed as I did so.

The voice in my head was silent for a time. “**Why do we still stand here?”** it asked. **“To the portal—quick now!**”

“Hold on,” I replied. “Fuck, it’s hard to talk without talking. *What are you? Who are you?*” I turned the amulet around in my hand. “*Wait…*” an amusing thought came to me. “*Let me guess… you’re a dragon? A real life dragon?*”

“**... Of course I’m a dragon! What sort of ludicrous question is that from a… what manner of creature are you again?**”

*“Uh… human? What kind of stupid question is that?”*

I heard a chuckle from the amulet, like the deep roaring of a fire. “**So thou dost have a mind? Now use said mind, and ears, and listen… thine portal—I can only keepeth it open for so long. Tis crucial we go. Now!**”

“*And where are we going?*” I replied, as if any of it made sense.

“**No consequence,”** the Dragon replied. **“I simply knowith that therein lies my next destination… and seeing as we art now entwined, it is** ***your*** **destination as well.**”

*“Linked? I don’t remember signing any TOS. No contracts. Did Ray set me up? Is this some type of MLM that my fucked-up subconscious is trying to escape from?* “

I was scrambling as my thoughts made less and less sense. Even to me.

“**MLM… TOS…”** I could sense the confusion from the supposed Dragon as well. **“Even delving into your mind didn’t provide me with the knowledge of such advanced concepts. Pray tell, are these things important to you humans?**”

*“Nevermind…”* I replied. “*Forget I said anything.*” Sighing, I paced back and forth. “*So basically you want me to go into the portal and bring you with me?”*

“**Yes.**”

*“And we don’t know the destination?”*

“**Nay… we do not.**”

*“And the quest? What is your mission?”*

“**... It escapes me for now.**”

I laughed. “*Oh for fucks sake. So you want me to take you through the unknown portal, to an unknown place, for an unknown reason?”*

“**I sense the mockery in thine voice,**” the dragon replied in a deep grumble that foretold ill-intentions. “**Human, if you do not do this thing for me, when I regain my true form, I will obliterate you from this realm… wherever and whenever this realm may be.**”

I considered the threat for a moment before shrugging my shoulders. “*Eh, Fuck it. I already bought the ticket, so I may as well ride the train. Either I’m tripping balls or dreaming. Either way, I’m in!*” I walked towards the portal and stood just in front of it. “*So what do I do? Just walk through?”*

“**Nay!**” the dragon’s deep voice boomed in my head. “**If you traverse the in-between without guidance, there is no telling where you will materialize. If you are to materialize at all. Hold me out in front of you, and I will guide thy way for us both.**”

“*Alright… let’s get this over with. I’m seriously going to give Grant some shit when this is over—if I don’t jump out a window, or some other crazy shit.*”

I held the amulet in front of me, facing the portal. The silver streak bent and twisted, expanding just a hair.

“**Now go!**” the dragon commanded.

I stepped through.

Austin felt like the right place for the next chapter, and I’m genuinely looking forward to planting roots and becoming part of the photography community here ( and if you ever need an extra set of hands on a wedding day, I’m happy to assist/second shoot when it makes sense).

1qvym6u,https://i.redd.it/fijnx5vq6jhg1.png,Where are people in Ireland / UK buying their Gaggia Classic Pro from? (Pricing feels wild 🤯),"Hi all,

I’m looking to buy a Gaggia Classic Pro and I’m a bit confused by pricing here in Ireland.

A lot of posts talk about picking these up new for around €400–450, but in Ireland/UK the only legit supplier I’ve found is Gaggia UK Direct. Once I spec the brass boiler, it’s about €635 before delivery, which feels like a big jump for a machine that’s often described as “great value.”

* Are there **other reliable sellers** in Ireland or the UK?
* Is this just **regional / post-Brexit pricing**?
* Or is this simply the new normal for the Classic Pro here?

I like the idea of the GCP as a solid, moddable machine, but at this price it’s hard to know if it still makes sense.

Would love to hear where people bought theirs and what they paid. Cheers",2,1770234085.0,gaggiaclassic,3,1.0,False

for example, in my sci fi setting, Hollow Stars, there is the Thylian hive.

The Thylian hive is kind of hard to classify because it sees itself as one being, but technically it is also a species. and if we get even more technical, you could argue its an entire ecosystem.

It remembers everything it ever did, observed and what other people did to it. It was created by the kingdom of Thylia(A minor faction that has not done much more of significance) as a science expirement.

The kingdom of Thylia had a very strict code of ethics regarding science, and so the Thylian hive genuenly loved its creators, and picked up a lot of their traits.

That was until the kingdom of Thylia got absolutely varporized by another minor faction. They did not have warships or anything else they could really fight back with.  
And so, they got completely wiped out in 30 minutes total. The Thylian hive barely survived with less than a dozen drones left spread across two different galaxies. It took almost 2 years to reunite them, but it eventually managed to do it.

It then managed to get it's claws on a non-sentient starship, a almost ancient IGEF(Intergalactic exploratory force) LLU(Limited Laboratory unit), which it was very happy about. It then crashed said starship into a planet.

That it was not happy about.

Anyway, it then completely devoured all life on the planet(It didn't have anything more intelligent than a blade of grass) and turned it into its own ecosystem.

From then, it had two goals: To follow the steps of it's creators and be as kind as possible to everyone and to get back on the people who wiped said creators out in the most petty ways it can.

Nowdays it has gotten its petty revenge by causing a complete shutdown of all coffee machines in the general area for as long as the nation that killed it's creators is still around, so it just helps people wherever it can.

1qvyjdj,https://v.redd.it/wrpbpvta6jhg1,"Review of Stanly Ranch in Napa, California","My boyfriend and I went to Napa over New Year’s, and we stayed at Bardessono, Auberge du Soleil, and Stanly Ranch. I was most excited about Auberge Du Soleil before we went, but Stanly Ranch ended up being surprisingly awesome. Adding my experience here to contribute to the collective travel wisdom. 

**Location**

Stanly Ranch is located about 10-15 min away from downtown Napa and it served as our base for Napa excursions on the last leg of our journey. They have a sprawling Ranch that’s walkable (or staff can take you in golf carts) with main pools, spa pools, wellness centers, etc. The pod-style rooms and A-frame buildings really gave me flashbacks to Wildflower Farms. 

**Room**

This was probably my favorite room layout of the 3 places we stayed. I really like the modern feel, indoor/outdoor showers with separate bathtub, the beautiful automatic blinds, etc. They do separate the outdoor areas with gardens in between, which worked well for us, but I did see some rooms with outdoor areas that face the walking path (perhaps in those rooms, the bed is situated somewhere else?). The windows are also tinted/reflective, but if you want more privacy, you’d probably want to go in the summer when the garden is filled out (or get a different room). We never saw or heard anyone when we were there though. 

**Food**

There’s a delicious restaurant on-site called Bear, but recommend to get reservations since it’s a popular restaurant and takes reservations from non-guests. They also have an adorable coffee shop, and seasonal pop-ups (like an ice cream window). It was fabulous but we mixed it up by going into Napa downtown to Oxbow Market and having a Sumo Dog, which was as good as any Michelin Star food we had on the trip. I think I would have gotten bored of 1 on-site restaurant if we’d stayed any longer, but the same was true for the other resorts as well. 

**Activities**

This is where I feel Auberge really shines—I randomly signed us up for a falconry experience and it was so so cool. We even got to interact with a micro owl that was so cute. I cannot recommend this experience enough.  We also did a spa day here and I’m glad we picked this resort of the three. Their spa facilities were very good—we were treated to snacks and warm neck wraps while waiting for our massages, and we did the complimentary salt room, sauna, steam room, and eucalyptus shower afterwards (need to reserve separately). Then we lounged at the heated pool and hot tub before heading out to Napa in their complementary electric G-wagon (other cars available as well). 

**Service**

The staff was awesome, and I do like their quick responses by text. I will say they are the only ones that emailed me ahead of time about our itinerary and handed me the itinerary at check-in. We didn’t really have any issues during our stay, so I can’t really attest to a response to any problems.

 

Overall great experience, I’m glad we stayed at all 3 properties, and I’d give the slight edge to Stanly Ranch because of the activities.",12,1770233924.0,chubbytravel,9,0.93,False
1qvyj8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qvyj8m/how_do_i_separate_my_funds_without_upsetting_my/,How do I separate my funds without upsetting my husband?,"This is something I’ve been thinking about for a long time. My husband and I have been together for a short time—two years total (dating included). We got married quickly because I got pregnant three months into dating.

Around our sixth month mark into dating, we decided to combine funds. We were already living together, sharing a car, and planning our future since I was carrying his child. It just made sense at the time and we were madly in love. My husband has really been into Dave Ramsey and his views on money and marriage, which ultimately became the deciding factor for sharing a bank account.

Now, almost a year into marriage, I’m starting to regret combining our funds. 

When we first started dating, my husband made it seem like he was really smart with money. He would always talk highly about not being in any debt and only spending his money on necessities. After we started sharing a bank account, however, he came clear that he *did* have debt and he wasn’t the best at saving.

Now, I’m no saint. I have debt, too. But I know how to save money and not abuse the cash I have. After he told me that, I didn’t know what to say or how to feel so I just told him it was fine and we’d work through it.

But it’s become apparent since then that he just really likes spending money. He likes working for money and seeing the number in our bank, but above all he likes *spending* it. It’s always on unnecessary things, too. A $7 coffee in the morning; a $16 meal when he’s off work; *hundreds* of dollars for new golf clubs and equipment. Literally whatever particular hobby he’s interested in, he obsesses over and spends all of our money on.

Often, he’ll blow our entire check in one weekend and leave us with nothing for two weeks. Mind you, I’ve had to make my daughter drink formula she’s not used to simply because we didn’t have the money to buy her the one she likes. I *hate* doing that and after the fifth time of forcing her to drink it, I’ve point-blank refused and made my husband promise to never do it again. 

I like to think I’m more frugal than he is. I’ll spend $5 for the entire pay period on something and then feel guilty for that. He’s always getting on me for spending money, but it’s *him* who has the problem, not me! But I’m not confrontational and when we argue, and his side always makes more sense than mine so I end up giving every time.

So now we come to our main conflict—a conflict he thinks is over with but I’m still milling about.

We only have one car, which we bought in May of last year. It’s a nice car—a Volkswagen SUV. He picked it out and decided it was the one for us. I liked the car and agreed with him, so we financed it and now pay monthly for it.

But it’s become very obvious that we need two vehicles. We work at the same job at opposite times. We do this because of our daughter needs to be watched. But I’ve honestly become depressed. I do nothing while he’s at work with the car except wander aimlessly at home and go on short walks outside. It’s the winter-time so I’m not out there as often as I’d like, which contributes to my depression. Sometimes I take him to work in the morning so I can have the car for the afternoon, but he often makes me feel guilty for it, saying he likes having the car so he can eat his lunch in there. Like, okay? In my mind I’m thinking, “Is taking his lunch in our car more important than how I feel?” Life would be infinitely easier if I had a car to be able to drive places. It wouldn’t just help me, but our family also. It has so many benefits.

I’ve had to ask his mom so many times to take us to doctor’s appointments or work or the store because I don’t have a mode of transportation and my husband isn’t willing to compromise his lunch for that. And if he is, he makes me feel bad for doing so. 

Another driving factor is that I have a new job lined up for me that would make our schedules in conflict with each other. It would mean putting our daughter in childcare. I want to do this new job because it’s a fantastic career and something I see myself doing. My husband said no because he doesn’t want our daughter to be cared for by a stranger. I get that part, but denying me my future because he’s uncomfortable just seems so unrealistic. He won’t meet me in the middle, either. 

However, aside from that, he doesn’t want to do a car payment. He refuses to get into debt again. And I* *agree and sympathize, but I think it’s just unrealistic. I have searched for an entire year for a car that we can buy outright with cash and have come up with nothing. My dad, who works in the industry, says it’s like finding a needle in a haystack. I need something reliable—something that’s going to last our family for years. My husband thinks we should buy a beater for $5k and he done with it, but I don’t want to do that.

We’re going to spend more on repairs than what the car’s worth. I’d much rather buy a nice car that’s going to last years and years than be miserable trying to fix a cheap one.

Long story short, I found a car I really liked: a VW Beetle with low miles and a manual transmission, which is more reliable than the automatic version. It was relatively cheap and I begged my husband for it. He said no because he “didn’t like it.”

And now I’m just stuck. Everything we do is on his terms. I’m literally just playing follow the leader. If he doesn’t like something or wants to do something then we’re not doing it. I feel irrelevant in all the important conversations.

Now I’m thinking about putting a percentage of my check away into a separate bank account for a car. He won’t have a say in it because it’s my money. Is that smart? I know that it would upset him greatly if I did that but I’m tired of being overshadowed by him.

Advice from anyone who’s been in the same situation or advice in general is much appreciated.

Also want to note: I spend money, too. Just not as often or as much. I spend what we budget for. *I* make the budget every month and *I* remind him what we can or cannot spend money on. *He* is the one that overspends.",4,1770233916.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

1qvyiuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1qvyiuy/marigolds_part_2_of_2/,Marigolds (Part 2 of 2),"At 12:30 I got the call I’ve been waiting for. Daria’s voice radiated from the phone, she sounded so excited, so happy.

“Ok James, you better get your things in order, I’m leaving for the clinic ok.” She giggled “Don’t you flake on me this time.” Then her voice softened a bit “Please come this time.”

Dad, just like I thought, let me go. He put his hands on my shoulders firmly, giving me this fake serious expression.

“Son, I’m going to fire you if you don’t bring me pictures, last time I had to beg Daria for them.”

I pulled into the parking lot at 12:50. The clinic was empty; the only cars that were there were staff.

I walked through the door, a chime accompanying my entrance. I stated my name and who I was here for. A nurse—I think—ushered me in.

The ultrasound room was colder than I expected—small, windowless, lit only by the dull glow of a computer screen. A plastic bottle of clear gel sat next to the keyboard like a condiment on a diner table. The exam bed was draped in thin, crinkly paper that rustled every time Daria moved.

She lay back slowly, belly exposed, the rest of her half-covered with a hospital sheet that barely reached her knees. The technician—a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and no visible interest in small talk—squeezed the gel onto Daria’s stomach. It glistened under the soft overhead light.

Then came the wand.

She pressed it down—not painfully, but firm. Still Daria flinched.

The screen flickered—grey static, then shadows swimming.

A curve. A twitch. A ripple of movement.

“There’s the heartbeat,” the tech said gently.

Then the sound filled the room. Fast. Watery. Mechanical. Like a horse galloping underwater. It made my skin crawl.

Daria squeezed my hand. “You hear that, James?” she whispered, smiling.

But I wasn’t looking at her.

The image was wrong.

At first, it looked like a baby’s head—but then the skull bulged outward, pulsing as if something inside was pushing to get out.

From the spine, long black cords extended—slick, rope-like, moving. Not waving. Reaching. One uncoiled and brushed the edge of the screen.

Another pulsed from the abdomen—thicker than the legs, like a root burrowing into the flesh from the inside.

My body locked. I couldn’t breathe. My hand twitched in Daria’s, but she didn’t look at me.

“He’s really growing,” she giggled. “He’ll be as big as us someday.”

I stared at the screen, bile rising in my throat.

Then—blink.

The image was normal again.

A baby. Just a baby. Soft skull. Normal limbs. Perfect little heartbeat.

Then the tech hit a button. The image vanished.

Daria beamed. “That was amazing.”

I just nodded, still gripping her hand, my palm ice-cold.

Ever since that morning, the thing hasn’t stopped watching.

At night, it waits in the bedroom corner.

During the day, it stands beside the front door—silent, still, always there.

I pass it every time I come home.

I don’t look at it anymore.

I hear it whispering when I close my eyes—sharp, venomous syllables in a language I can’t begin to understand.

They rattle in my skull like static.

Sleep is a joke now.

Work’s worse than ever. I’ve been moved to the prep station just to keep up with the flood of orders. Bills are stacking, and the real estate deal I need to close keeps slipping further away. I’ve even thought about asking Dad for help.

But all of that… faded when I opened the front door that night. It was the Monday after Daria’s ultrasound.

The box with the crib was sitting in the nursery.

Daria was painting clouds on the baby-blue walls, her brush moving slow and steady.

She turned as I stepped in. “Oh! I didn’t know you’d be home so early.”

I held up the pizza box. “It’s six o’clock. Figured I’d pick up dinner.”

She smiled. “That actually sounds amazing right now.”

I pointed at one of the clouds. “That one does not look anything like a cloud.”

It looked more like a blob than a nice soft cloud.

She pouted. “I’ve never been an artist, and it’s not like the baby’ll care.”

Dinner was quiet in the best kind of way.

The thing didn’t appear. The kitchen felt warm again—like it used to. I honestly couldn’t even taste the pizza.

Daria sat across from me, still in her paint-streaked clothes, eyes soft and glowing in the evening light.

The sunlight poured through the window, catching her hair—it looked like fire paused mid-flicker.

She caught me staring. “Jamie,” she said, tilting her head.

“Yeah?”

“What are you looking forward to most?”

She rested her chin in her hand. “About the baby, I mean.”

I thought for a second. “Family dinners,” I said finally. “Us at the table. All of us. Just... eating together. When he’s older, of course.”

She smiled like she was already there, watching it happen.

“I’m looking forward to taking care of him,” she said softly.

“The house is so quiet sometimes. I can’t wait for it to be messy and loud and alive. I want to hear little feet on the floor.”

She placed her hand on her belly and laughed gently. “He’s kicking again. I think he knows we’re talking about him.”

I stood and moved around the table, crouching beside her. “Really?”

She took my hand and guided it to her stomach. A few seconds passed—and then I felt it: a firm, tiny nudge beneath the skin. Like a heartbeat you could touch.

My lips curled into a smile I didn’t have to think about. “Still feels like a muscle twitch to me.”

She laughed. “Don’t ruin the magic, James.”

I kissed the side of her belly. “Okay. That one was a ninja kick.”

She beamed, running her fingers through my hair. “We still need a name.”

I nodded. “I know. Feels like we’re behind.”

She looked off, thoughtful. Then her eyes found mine again. “Honestly? I like James Jr.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Really?”

She nodded. “I like the way it sounds. And it means I get to call him Junior. That just feels right, you know?”

She grinned. “Can’t wait to chase him around the house yelling it.”

I laughed with her. I really did. For a moment, it was like none of it mattered—not the exhaustion, not the dreams, not the bills. Just me, her, and the baby we were waiting on.

But the moment didn’t last. It never can.

The thing won’t leave me alone anymore.

It follows me now. Not just at home. Not just in dreams.

At work, it stands in the back corner of the freezer—just far enough into the shadows that the frost doesn’t touch it. I see it when I turn around, after grabbing a box of sausage patties or hash browns. Just… standing there. Watching.

It never moves. But every time I turn my back, I swear I feel it leaning forward. Like it’s considering something.

At the firm, it’s stationed beside the coffee machine. Mary thinks I’m lazy. She keeps giving me this puzzled look every time I ask her to pour my cup. I can’t explain it to her.

It’s back by the front door at home, too. Same place as always. Still as furniture. Just part of the layout now.

I’ve stopped reacting. If I don’t acknowledge it, maybe it won’t do anything. Maybe it just wants to be seen. Maybe it already knows everything.

I’m not sleeping. Not really. I rest in fragments now. Fifteen minutes here. Maybe an hour on the couch if I’m lucky. I’ve been getting up earlier just to get ahead of it. 4:30 a.m., every morning. McDonalds opens at five. I try to be there before it notices I’m gone.

I’m starting to feel like a robot. Just going through the same motions every day. I can’t tell if I’m even exhausted.

The only upside is the money. With how much I’ve been working, I’ve finally pulled ahead. Two real estate deals closed last week—$7,000 sitting in my account. It’s the most I’ve had in years. Enough to cover the hospital. Enough for the next two months of bills. Enough to maybe even buy Daria something nice.

But none of it feels real. It’s just numbers.

Daria’s due soon.

Sunday, I took an extra shift at McDonald’s.

Daria looked disappointed when I told her.

Still, I managed to finish the crib. Daria got the nursery painted.

It’s strange, standing in that room now — soft blue walls, clouds near the middle, faintly cartoonish. It feels so… nice, in there. I even helped with the ceiling — stuck glow-in-the-dark stars to it, so when it's bedtime, it looks like a night sky frozen in time.

This morning, I caught Daria just standing there — arms crossed, hands on her hips, scanning the room like a commander surveying a battlefield. Every now and then, she’d adjust something. A stuffed animal. A mobile. A blanket corner. Then step back. Then forward again.

She’s adorable when she’s like that.

But the moment I got to work, the feeling curdled.

The thing had moved.

It stood dead center in the lobby — out in the open now, waiting for me behind the register.

It stared through me.

Its tentacles stretched slowly outward, crawling up the walls, spilling across the ceiling like roots. The air felt thick — humid, oppressive. Like standing in a jungle that had long since rotted.

The smell hit next: mold and something older, something wet and dead.

And still, no one noticed.

Customers stepped on the tendrils, slick and pulsing. I heard them squish underfoot. A kid leaned against the wall, I watched a strand of black slime fall down and soak into his hair — thick and glistening.

He didn’t flinch.

His parents kept eating.

I made it through the shift. Barely. By the end, I couldn’t feel my fingers. My legs moved without me.

I almost ran out the door.

My phone rang as I reached the car.

I climbed inside, hands shaking, and answered.

“James?” Daria’s voice crackled through the phone, slightly alarmed.

“Yes?” I responded.

“Your parents are coming over. They just called and said they’d be over in 30 minutes.” She explained.

“What!” I half yelled into my phone. “No notice, no nothing?”

“I know, I was just about to get in the bath.” She continued. “Do you want me to just order some pizza? I mean that’s what we always have, I don’t have time to cook them lunch.”

I sighed. “Yeah, that’d be fine. Order the bigger, more expensive pizzas. I'll bill it to Dad. Dad likes Meat Lovers, and Mom likes pineapple, uhh, nevermind — get her cheese and we’ll keep it.”

She giggled. “Alright, at least we’ll get something out of it.”

I hung up, still staring at the empty passenger seat.

Traffic was worse than I expected. It took me thirty-five minutes to get home.

Dad’s big, showy SUV was parked crooked in the driveway, taking up most of it and leaving Daria’s car awkwardly squeezed in. I had to reverse back out and park on the street just to avoid boxing them in.

When I walked inside, my parents and Daria were already gathered at the table, chatting. Four oversized pizza boxes sat stacked in the middle like a makeshift centerpiece.

She’d really ordered the expensive ones — probably twelve bucks each.

“Well, look who finally showed up,” Dad bellowed from across the room.

I scanned the house. No sign of the thing.

“James, why haven’t you called your mother?” Mom was already up, arms open, pulling me into a hug.

She smelled like expensive lotion and wine. Her long blond hair hadn’t grayed yet — always perfectly brushed. In her mid-fifties, but she still dressed like she was on her way to a charity gala. And that expression — vaguely disappointed, like she was reviewing a hotel room she didn’t book.

Over her shoulder, Daria caught my eye.

We shared the same look: Really?

“You look exhausted,” Mom said, brushing her fingers across my cheek. “Are you even sleeping?”

I pulled back, gently. “Been working a lot.”

Her silence demanded more.

“My insurance isn’t great. I want to have enough saved for the birth,” I added.

She gave a tight nod, but her eyes kept scanning my face like she was still looking for something to fix.

“So,” Dad said, rising with a grunt and wiping his hands on a napkin, “where’s my grandson going to be staying? I’m not paying for this pizza until I see it.”

I pointed upstairs, but he was already moving. Daria followed, probably to keep him from poking into the wrong room.

Before I could follow, Mom placed a manicured hand on my shoulder.

“You could’ve done better than pizza, James,” she said, voice clipped.

I turned. “You gave us thirty minutes’ notice. What did you expect, a five-course meal?”

“Pizza just… doesn’t reflect status,” she replied, as if that explained anything. Then she swept past me and headed upstairs.

That’s always been Mom. More concerned with appearances than effort. She’s never worked a day in her life, but you’d think she ran a Fortune 500 company the way she talked about “presenting well.”

I followed them upstairs.

The nursery door was open.

And there it was.

The thing stood at the end of the hallway, etched in shadow.

Its tentacles hung like vines — draping from the ceiling, crawling along the floor, weaving across the walls. But they all stopped just short of the nursery doorway.

I stepped into the nursery, calm on the outside, skin crawling beneath.

“Whoa,” Dad said, craning his neck to look up. “You even did the stars on the ceiling. Do they glow?”

“They do,” Daria said proudly. “James put them up.” She looked down at her belly and added with a laugh, “I’m… not tall enough.”

Mom stood near the bookshelf, smiling with polite approval. “You’ve really created a lovely space for Junior.”

Daria beamed. “I know, right? We worked so hard on this. James built the furniture, and I painted and decorated. It took forever. I wish we’d done it earlier — before I got so… round.”

She walked them through every piece of it — the crib, the clouds, the night-sky ceiling. Her voice was light, full of pride and love. For a moment, it felt like all the bad things were far away.

I stood by the door, nodding occasionally, eyes flicking back to the hallway.

The thing didn’t move.

Eventually, we filtered back downstairs.

The living room lights were too bright. The air felt too still. And the pizza smelled off — greasy and sharp, like cardboard soaked in salt. I chewed through a slice without tasting it, nodding along to whatever conversation my parents were having. But my mind was still upstairs.

Would the thing turn our house into another jungle, like it did McDonald’s? Would the walls start sweating, the floors pulse underfoot, the air grow thick and wet and moldy?

I flinched at the thought.

“James?” My mother’s voice cut through the fog.

I blinked. Everyone was staring. Even Daria.

“James, yoo-hoo. Earth to James,” Dad said, waving a hand in front of my face with a chuckle.

“Sorry.” I shifted in my chair. “Spaced out.”

Daria gave me a concerned glance.

“Well,” Mom said, brushing a napkin across her lips, “we’re heading to Florida next week. A little early spring break. You two should come.”

Dad jumped in. “We’ll cover it — the flights, hotel. Everything.”

He meant he would. My mother had never paid for anything but Botox and judgment.

Daria hesitated. “Elizabeth, I’d love to, but… I don’t think I can. The baby could come any time now. The doctor said we should be on alert.”

“You’re at 32 weeks, right?” Dad asked, squinting.

“Thirty-six,” she corrected, more gently than I would’ve.

I cleared my throat. “And with hospital bills, I need to pick up more hours.”

Mom let out a tight, irritated sigh — the kind that could cut drywall.

“I suppose that’s a no, then,” she said, her tone flat but pointed.

I nodded. “Yeah. Sorry. It’s just bad timing.”

Dad draped an arm around her shoulder. “Hey, it’s fine. No pressure. Next time.”

There was an awkward silence after that. Just the sound of crust crunching and someone’s chewing. I glanced over at Daria — she looked a little stunned, but she shrugged and leaned forward to grab another slice.

Eventually, they stood to leave. Mom offered a stiff goodbye hug. Dad slapped my back and told me to “keep grinding.” They left the leftover pizza.

I stood in the doorway watching their SUV pull away, the tail lights glowing red in the dimming sky.

Daria joined me, folding her arms across her chest.

“I’m starting to get sick of pizza,” I muttered.

She laughed softly. “I’m not. Still my favorite.”

We stood there a while, not saying anything. Just the hum of the fridge and the ticking clock.

Daria was still standing in the entryway, arms crossed. Her hair was caught in the overhead light, glowing faintly orange. She shifted, hesitating.

“James… does your mom dislike me?” she asked, softly.

I turned to her. She wasn’t angry. Just small. Like the question had been sitting in her chest all night and finally found its way out.

“No,” I said quickly. “Daria, she just… you know how she is. My mom’s too concerned with how things look. That’s her whole deal. Don’t take it personally.”

She nodded, but didn’t look relieved.

“I just…” She rubbed one arm with the other. “I want both to like me. My parents don’t even want to see me.”

She looked down. Her voice dropped a bit. “I called them a couple days ago. Told them they’d have a grandchild soon.”

I stayed quiet.

“They wanted me to go to college,” she continued. “And as they put it, ‘do something with your life.’ Like creating a new one doesn’t count.”

Her shoulders slumped, Her expression falling.

“Is that normal?” she asked, barely above a whisper.

“No,” I said, stepping closer. “That’s not normal at all. It’s cruel. They’re losing the best part of their lives.”

She nodded again, but slower this time.

I tried to soften the air. “Don’t worry about my parents, okay? They like you. You should’ve seen my mom when I told her you were pregnant—it actually knocked her out of her ‘ice queen’ routine. She and Dad were literally jumping for joy. I’ve never seen them do that. Ever.”

That earned a small smile. Just a twitch at the corners of her mouth, but it was enough.

I flopped onto the couch with a sigh and grabbed the remote. The living room was dim except for the amber spill of light from the kitchen and the pale blue flicker of the TV screen coming to life.

Daria eased down beside me. Her hands rested on her stomach.

“I mean, I have you,” she said, gently. “So it’s all good.”

She laughed—not forced. Just tired and soft. “I can’t wait for the baby.”

I turned on some dumb Hallmark movie.

“Oh I bet, he’s pretty heavy,” I joked.

She looked jokingly taken aback then poked my cheek. “You know, James, most people are more excited about the birth of their child than just its physical weight.”

I shrugged, smiling. “Yeah, though he’s probably heavy. Especially today. Almost seems like he’s lower down.”

She nodded, rubbing her stomach slowly. “He’s going to be a big guy. I can feel it.”

She leaned her head onto my shoulder, a content little breath slipping out of her.

“Probably gonna outgrow his dad,” I said. “Definitely his grandpa. He’s short.”

Daria giggled. “You’re not exactly a giant, James.”

“No,” I said, mock-sulking. “But I’m medium tall.”

We sat like that for a while—her head on my shoulder. The glow from the TV painted shifting light across the room.

Daria pointed at the screen. “I didn’t know we got these silly movies.”

She turned her head, squinting up at me. “You’re not paying for these, are you?”

I shook my head. “No. I don’t even have time to sit down and watch anything.”

She nodded, then grew quiet—her eyes tracking something across the carpet.

“Hey, James?” she asked, her voice soft.

“Yeah?”

“What do you think Junior’s favorite color will be?”

She looked down as she asked it, hands smoothing her belly like she was already trying to comfort him.

“Blue,” I said.

Daria furrowed her brow looking up again. “Why? You said that pretty fast.”

“Well... we painted his room blue. So, I mean... logic, right? Mine’s red because my race car bed as a kid was red.”

She smirked. “Fair. That’s a fair hypothesis.”

I looked at the screen. The movie was already halfway in. Some guy in a perfectly tailored suit was talking on two phones at once.

“Wanna watch the movie?” I asked. “Thirty bucks says the initial fiancé’s a rich guy who’s too busy for the female lead.”

“As long as it’s with you,” she said, resting her cheek against my shoulder again. “Sure.”

I wrapped my arm around her. It all felt so… warm.

Daria shifted, uncomfortable.

I looked at her to see what was wrong, but she was focused on the movie.

The movie ended in the usual soft-focus blur—kisses, confessions, everyone conveniently happy. Daria stretched, yawning, and glanced at the clock.

“Oh. It’s already six o’clock,” she said with mock disappointment. “I’m guessing it’s bedtime for you.”

“Yep,” I said, standing with a groan. “Big breakfast planned. Extravagant, within our means.”

“Leftover pizza?” she teased.

“Nope. I bought the expensive bacon. We’re celebrating thirty-seven weeks.”

She blinked. “It’s thirty-six weeks.”

I laughed. “Got my weeks messed up. I realized when you told dad earlier.”

She lightly smacked my arm, half-smiling. “James, you can’t be forgetting that kind of thing.”

“I’ve got a lot on my mind,” I said. “Guess I’ll have to carry you to bed as penance.”

“Oh, so now we’re romantic,” she said, grinning.

“Just making up for lost time.”

I scooped her into a princess carry, slow and steady.

“You know you’re heavy,” I muttered as I shifted my grip.

She narrowed her eyes, amused. “James, if you want this to be your only child, keep talking.”

“Honestly, between my mouth and my jobs, we’re probably maxed out anyway.”

She laughed—real and bright. “With time, James. With time.”

I started up the stairs.

The thing was in the hallway.

Its limbs were still. Tentacles curled tight against the ceiling beams, pulling slightly farther away.

I didn’t look at it long.

I carried Daria past without speaking. The monster didn’t move.

I laid her gently on the bed. She giggled as I pulled the covers over her and kissed her forehead.

“Love you, James,” she mumbled, already sinking into the pillows.

“Love you too,” I said, settling down beside her.

Her warmth met mine in the quiet.

She shifted a little, one arm draped across my chest. The house was still—no pipes creaked, no cars passed, no distant sirens. Just the faint hum of the fridge downstairs and her breathing, deepening by the second.

The room felt... soft. Like it was holding its breath.

I pulled her close.

And drifted off.

I was in the field again.

The marigolds shimmered under starlight—

but the grass was gone.

Only dirt now.

Dry, cracked, and dark as ash.

The stars overhead burned brighter than I remembered.

Sharper. Hungrier.

And the sky—

darker somehow, though it was full of light.

I turned to face the moon—

but the moon was gone.

In its place hung the shattered corpse of a planet, fractured like broken glass, the pieces frozen mid-collapse.

A sudden weight pressed into my arms.

I looked down.

It was a baby.

But not.

Tentacles curled from its skull—short, underdeveloped things, limp across my forearms like damp seaweed.

Its skin was gray, veined with faint pulses of sickly violet.

Rotted in places, soft in others.

Still warm.

Its arms reached for me, weak but eager.

Its legs kicked gently, like it was happy.

There was no malice in it.

Only motion.

Only need.

The air was cool and clean.

Almost peaceful.

The thing shivered.

Then came the sound—a thin, high-pitched squeal, shrill and slurred.

I flinched.

But didn’t let go.

It made the sound again—closer to a giggle now.

Then:

“Dada.”

Distorted—garbage-slick and wrong. But unmistakable.

It had no face, no mouth, no breath—only writhing tentacles where lips should be.

Still, it spoke.

“Dada.”

And again.

Softer. Pleased.

Happy.

Something inside me trembled.

Not fear.

Something else.

Warmth?

For a second—only a second—I swore I heard Daria’s laugh buried in its voice.

Warped. Twisted. Like a cassette tape melting in the sun.

This was mine?

I was holding my baby?

The thought came fast, uninvited.

Part of me screamed.

This thing—this impossibility—it was mine.

Then came the scream.

From behind me.

Inhuman. Enraged.

The wind rose.

Cold. Furious.

I curled the baby tighter in my arms, shielding it with my body.

Then—

a wet touch around my ankle.

A tendril.

Slippery. Hungry. Rising.

Before I could move, it yanked me down.

I woke with a start.

Labored breath. The feeling of something wet.

The clock read 3:12 a.m.

I sat up fast and turned to Daria.

She was hunched over, gripping her stomach, her face pale and tight.

“James,” she whispered. “I think I’m in labor.”

She winced, one hand bracing against the mattress, the other reaching for me.

“It started a while ago,” she said, her voice strained. “Ten minutes apart. Then seven. Now five.”

Her fingers dug into my arm as another wave hit. She hissed through her teeth.

“It’s not stopping, James.”

I looked down. The sheet beneath her was damp—just enough to darken the fabric.

“I think my water broke,” she murmured. Her eyes didn’t leave mine.

“Okay. Let’s get your stuff. Can you walk?”

She nodded.

I dressed fast, yanking my phone off the charger and leaving the cord behind. I helped her out of bed, steadying her with one arm around her waist.

The night air was cold as I guided her to the car.

I helped her into the front seat, reclined it slightly, and pulled the seatbelt across her lap. Her breath hitched again as she closed her eyes through another contraction.

“You’re doing great,” I said, not sure if it was true.

I climbed in, jammed the keys into the ignition. The car dinged at me like it didn’t know what was happening.

I should’ve called ahead.

But I didn’t.

I just drove.

The streets were empty.

I pulled into the small circle in front of the ER entrance. No valet. No one outside. Just the buzz of a flickering overhead light.

I threw the car into park and hopped out, rushing around to open her door. Daria’s eyes were half-closed, her hands gripping the seatbelt like a rope. Her breathing had gone shallow and rhythmic, like she was counting something only she could hear.

“Can you walk?” I asked, already unbuckling her.

She nodded, jaw clenched. “Let’s go.”

I helped her out, one arm around her back. She leaned into me hard—half her weight on my shoulder—and we shuffled through the automatic glass doors.

Inside, the air was too bright. Too clean. A front desk sat under blue LED lights, empty except for a lone nurse typing something into a terminal.

She looked up.

“Hi, she’s—my wife’s in labor,” I stammered. “Thirty-six weeks. Water broke.”

The nurse stood instantly. “Let’s get you into triage.”

She hit a button. Another set of doors hissed open. A second nurse appeared, pushing a wheelchair.

Daria tried to wave it off. “I’m okay,” she said, weakly.

But she sat.

The nurse wheeled her fast down a long, silent hallway. I kept pace beside them, phone clutched in my hand, heart knocking against my ribs like it wanted out.

We turned through a side corridor and into a narrow exam room. Low bed. Machines. Plastic curtain pulled halfway across the tile floor. A blood pressure cuff hung limp from the wall.

“Hospital gown’s on the chair. Change as much as you can. I’ll be back to check dilation,” the nurse said.

She left without fanfare. Like this was just another Tuesday night.

I helped Daria out of her coat. Her nightgown stuck to her skin where the fluid had soaked through. She didn’t say much—just moved slow, steady, like her whole body was trying to stay calm for the baby.

She eased onto the bed. I sat beside her.

“You’re doing good,” I said, softly.

She looked over at me, eyes heavy. “It hurts a little. But I can take it.”

The nurse came back. She slipped on gloves, asked Daria to breathe deep, and checked her.

“Five centimeters,” she said, almost pleased. “You’re in active labor. Everything’s looking good. We’ll admit you now.”

She smiled at Daria. “Baby’s ready.”

Daria tried to smile back. It didn’t quite land. But it was close.

We moved into a private delivery room fifteen minutes later.

Dimmer lights. A window showing the dark parking lot outside. One monitor beeped softly in the corner, tracking the heartbeat of something still inside her. IV tubes coiled gently from the stand beside the bed. The air smelled faintly like antiseptic and lavender-scented soap.

I sat in the chair next to her. Held her hand.

“I can’t believe this is happening,” she said, eyes up at the ceiling.

“I know,” I whispered. “But you’ve got this.”

She looked over at me, then down at her belly. Her fingers moved slowly across the bump like she was already trying to say goodbye without knowing it.

“I can’t wait to meet him,” she said.

Her voice was soft. Whole.

Time blurred.

The nurse checked her again—eight centimeters.

Another contraction hit hard, and Daria clenched my hand so tightly I thought she might crush bone. Her breath came out in quick, shaking bursts.

“I want it over,” she whispered. “I just want him here.”

“You’re almost there,” I said. “You’re doing amazing.”

The nurse gave a quiet nod. “You’re doing great, Daria. Next one, we’ll start pushing.”

They adjusted the bed. Another nurse came in. The room shifted subtly—monitors, wires, gloves snapping on. Everything became sharper. Brighter.

Daria cried out—just once—as the next contraction hit. I wiped her forehead. Her fingers curled into the blanket.

“Okay, push with this next one,” the nurse said gently. “Deep breath. Push.”

She did.

Hard.

I watched her face twist—pain, focus, everything at once. Her free hand gripped the bed rail, knuckles white.

And then—

She stopped.

She blinked.

Her eyes widened like something inside her had come unfastened.

Her lips parted, breath hitching.

“James,” she whispered. “Something’s wrong.”

I stood.

Before I could speak, her whole body jerked.

For a second, everything stilled. She looked at me like she didn’t know who I was. Like she was slipping.

One of the machines spiked—then dropped.

The nurse's smile vanished. “Daria?”

Daria gasped, like the air had been yanked from her lungs.

Blood—too much—began spreading beneath her. The IV line thrashed as her arm went limp.

A strange sound came from her throat—wet, broken, like she was trying to speak underwater.

Then—

Alarms.

Everything blurred. One nurse hit the call button. Another shouted into the hallway. The OB team poured in like a flood.

A doctor was suddenly at her side. Orders flew fast.

“Vitals crashing—get the crash cart!”

“Push epi!”

“We need to get the baby out—now!”

“Possible AFE! Go!”

I was still holding her hand when they pried it from mine.

“Sir—you need to step out now.”

“No—I’m not—” I started, but they were already moving.

Someone gripped my shoulders and turned me toward the door.

“She’s in the best hands,” a voice said—maybe the nurse from before. “We’ll get you when we can.”

The last thing I saw was her face.

Still. Pale.

Eyes half-lidded.

Then the door slammed shut.

I stood alone in the hallway.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. A nurse ran past, pushing a cart. Far off, a vending machine hummed.

I wandered back into the waiting room.

Everything was motionless—except the clock. It ticked, loud and steady.

One minute became ten.

Ten became thirty.

Thirty blurred into an hour. Then two.

Then the door opened.

An older nurse stepped inside. Her voice was tired. “Are you James Carter?”

I nodded.

“We need you in one of the consultation rooms.”

I stood. My knees wobbled beneath me.

The nurse held the door open.

I followed.

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I clenched them into fists, but it didn’t help.

“Is… is she okay?” I asked. My voice cracked.

“We need to be in a private area,” she said gently.

We stepped into a small room. Cold, neutral walls. A single cheap chair sat waiting for me.

.

“We’re very sorry,” she began, her voice soft but professional. Detached. “Your wife, Daria, experienced a rare complication. Amniotic Fluid Embolism. We did all we could… but we lost both.”

I felt something inside me throb. Not pain. Not yet. Just... a pulse.

I nodded.

She hesitated. “Would you like to speak with someone?”

“No.”

“Would you… would you like to see them?”

A long pause.

“Yes.”

She led me through a side hallway. Into the bereavement room.

The scent of antiseptic hung in the air. Soft. Almost sweet.

I stepped inside.

Daria lay on the bed.

Still.

Her hair brushed over her shoulder, neatly combed. Her lips closed, no smudge of sleep. Her arms straight at her sides—not folded awkwardly under her like usual. Her skin pale, too even.

Her eyes closed.

She didn’t look like she was asleep.

And next to her, in a small bassinet, was James Jr.

His skin was soft pink.

His head bald.

His face scrunched, the way babies do when they’re new. But he didn’t move. No twitch, no stir, no tiny hiccup.

No breath.

I stepped forward.

I looked down.

And I picked him up.

He was cold.

I sat beside Daria. Dragged the stiff hospital chair across the tile until it touched the bed. I reached out and took her hand in mine.

It was cold, too.

“Look, Daria,” I whispered, my throat raw. “We did good. We… we did good.”

My voice broke.

I sat there.

The room was quiet, except for the hum of the hospital’s vents and the slow rasp of my own breathing.

Eventually, a different nurse came in holding a folder. She sat beside me, eyes fixed on the floor.

“Mr. Carter,” she said softly. “I’m sorry for your loss. But we need a few more things from you.”

She opened the folder. “These are the release forms for Daria and your baby. You can take your time. We’ll need the name of a funeral home before we can transfer them.”

“South Central,” I said.

She nodded. “We’re required to offer a memory packet—prints, a lock of hair. You don’t have to take it, but...”

I nodded again.

“And… would you like to request an autopsy?”

“Yes.”

She pointed at a page in the folder. “There are resources here, sir. People you can talk to if you need help. You’re welcome to stay a bit longer, or we can—”

“Thank you,” I said. “But I’m going home.”

I stood.

I placed Junior gently back into his bassinet. I looked at Daria one last time—memorized the lines of her face, the stillness in her shoulders, the hush in her chest.

Then I walked out.

The hospital lights brightened as I passed, The daytime lights flickering on.

The front doors opened.

The sky had begun to pale. A soft blue tint on the horizon. The streets were alive with early traffic—people going to work. Coffee cups. Breakfast wrappers. Headlights.

I climbed into the car. It was still parked where we left it, the passenger seat empty now.

I drove home.

The front door was still wide open.

I stepped inside and shut it behind me. The house was quiet. The folder thudded onto the kitchen table. A heavy, final sound.

Nothing moved.

The air felt... wrong. Like it was waiting…

I climbed the stairs.

Each one creaked under my weight.

I turned at the top, rounded the banister, and walked into the nursery.

The sky-blue walls. The cartoon clouds. The stars I’d stuck to the ceiling.

The little mobile turned lazily above the crib, catching the early sunlight. The light spilled across the room in soft beams.

And in the windowsill, set in a small clay pot, a single marigold bloomed.

Its petals glowed gold in the morning light.

I sank to the floor.

My knees hit the carpet. My body folded in on itself. I didn’t sob—not at first. Just breathed.

Then the first tear fell.

Then the second.

Then everything broke open.

A low, rattling noise slipped from my throat—half moan, half gasp. I curled tighter, hands over my head, arms wrapped around my ribs like I was trying to hold myself in.

I wept. Deep, wracking sobs that tore from my lungs and spilled into the quiet room.

I thought of her hand in mine. Cold.

I thought of our son. Still.

I thought of the stars on the ceiling and the clouds we painted badly, and how proud she was when she looked at them.

“Oh God,” I whispered. “Why…”

My tears soaked the carpet.

My breath shook.

And the marigold bloomed, untouched.

i went cold turkey. from drinking 3-6 espresso shots daily to 0. it was surprisingly very easy. i thought i was addicted to coffee. i guess i wasn’t. or maybe i was, but wasn’t a huge addiction. yeah there was many days i was craving for some espresso, but i got through it. well today i had an iced americano and it tasted so good.

for dairy… i see for many people here dairy isn’t great for them. for me dairy was never an issue, but ditching it made me realise i don’t miss it, i never craved for a slice of cheese over my burger patty. the only thing that made a difference was that i dramatically dropped more weight, more than i wanted to. not easy for me to eat enough if i stick to just meat, salt, butter. like a cheese stick or two was a good snack in between meals.

if your goal is to drop weight, removing dairy completely will help you a lot. if you want to maintain or gain weight, then adding dairy might be the answer for you.",7,1770233586.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

I'm currently working on a project to improve how specialty green coffee is sourced and delivered to roasters (specifically focused on single-origin and fresh harvests).

I’ve heard many stories about inconsistent quality, high shipping costs for small volumes, or just lack of transparency in the ""active harvest"" timeline. I want to build something that actually solves these pain points, but first, I need to hear from the experts here.

What is the #1 thing that frustrates you when buying green beans today?

* Is it the high minimum order quantities (MOQs)?
* The lack of detailed flavor profiles or cupping notes?
* Shipping delays or costs?
* Difficulty finding specific ""clean and fruity"" profiles?

I’d love to hear your experiences or any ""horror stories"" you've had. Your feedback will be incredibly helpful to make sure I’m building something that actually adds value to the roasting community.

Most guests eat like decent people. The data, and every slammed Saturday, tell a different story.

From the pass, you see it. Four-top in the window. Phones on plates before bread hits. One guest is chewing with an open mouth while videos run in his hand. Toddler under the table with fries in both fists. Parent running a loop of weak apologies. No advanced degree needed. Blown knees, burned arms, and too many doubles provide enough research.

Etiquette never left. It moved into survey tables, corporate training budgets, and the quiet stress of servers working the rush of the shift. Understand where etiquette lies now. Why does the disconnect exist between your guests and staff? It matters because your staff navigate that gap every shift.

**Guests Swear They Have Manners. Numbers Argue.**

YouGov ran a national survey on traditional dining etiquette in April 2024. 89% of respondents report chewing with their mouth closed when they eat with other people. 81% say they avoid talking with food in their mouth. 73% say they ask for items to be passed instead of reaching across. 69% say they wait until everyone has food before they start.

The same survey shows an age divide. People 45 and older report higher rates of napkins in laps, passing rather than reaching, and basic phrases like “excuse me” when they leave the table. Table manners didn’t fall off a cliff. They slide up with age.

Home practice looks thin. An Instacart report on family dinners from January 2025 pulled together earlier research and highlighted a 2019 survey. Only 29% of people in the United States told researchers they sit at a dinner table every day. That article also pointed to work showing around 70% of meals in this country happen away from home.

YouGov followed up with a separate survey on what people do during dinner. 63% reported watching television while they eat. 41% said they talk with people nearby. 28% said they look at a phone. More screens than conversation. More couch than table.

Look at your Friday book. Those habits walk through your door.

**Phones Own the Room. Guests Hate It. They Still Reach for Them.**

FoodNotPhones, a program backed by Acosta Group, released survey results in November 2023. 68% of households reported someone using a phone during shared meals. 65% said phone use during meals bothers them. 42% called it rude. The same homes supply the guests who glare at other people’s screens in your dining room.

Old-line etiquette never softened on this. The Emily Post Institute keeps repeating simple rules across its channels. No texting while engaged in social interaction, especially at meals. For urgent messages, excuse yourself, step away, send the note, return to the table.

Yelp went straight to diners. Its first Dining Etiquette Report, published in August 2024, surveyed nearly 2.000 users. Nearly eight in ten respondents said phones should stay out of sight on a date. Around half showed that level of concern during dinners with friends or family. Roughly two-thirds said answering an urgent call feels acceptable if someone explains why a phone sits on the table. Large majorities mute ringers in social settings. Three-quarters do so around family, 76% with friends, 83% on dates.

The same Yelp report shows a softer rule for food photos. 63% of respondents approve quick shots of plates. An etiquette expert quoted in the article tells people to take one photo when food arrives, then put the phone away.

Guests know phones wreck the room. Guests resent phones. Guests still bring phones out. Front-of-house staff absorb that collision during every turn.

**Who Trains Table Manners Now**

Parents handle part of it. Schools cover a little. The rest leaks across everyone who works with kids.

A manners education company called Manners To Go sells curricula to schools and youth groups. In a 2022 blog post, it described a “team” approach. Parents, teachers, youth workers, and etiquette experts share responsibility for basic social behavior. The duty spreads out. No single place finishes the job.

Corporate offices now pay people to patch gaps that older generations filled at home. CBS Bay Area covered a San Francisco etiquette coach in 2025 who runs dining and workplace behavior workshops for Gen Z professionals. Companies pay hundreds of dollars per person for sessions on using utensils, handling bread, ordering alcohol with clients, and dressing for work lunches at real restaurants.

The San Francisco Standard reported on similar coaching for young hires, a story later picked up by India Today in July 2025. Firms in that coverage hire etiquette coaches to address hygiene, greetings, and basic office behavior. One survey cited in those reports, from [Intelligent.com](http://Intelligent.com), found that about 12% of employers had seen Gen Z applicants bring a parent to a job interview. That detail says plenty about comfort levels around face-to-face norms.

Every pre-shift and every family meal inside your restaurant teaches more manners than any of those seminars. New staff watch how leaders sit, talk, and eat. When owners eat alone in the office, staff lose a live model for how adults behave at a table. When family meal disappears in favor of extra prep, new hires miss a low-risk place to learn social rules around food.

The village spreads effort across homes, schools, coaches, and HR. Your dining room still finishes the training.

**Guests Say Etiquette Doesn’t Matter. They Judge Everyone Anyway.**

A survey from British chain Prezzo in 2024 tried to measure attitudes toward table manners. Coverage from Fox 5 Atlanta and the New York Post broke it down for readers. Roughly half of Gen Z diners in that study said table etiquette no longer matters in modern life. 77% didn’t care about elbows on tables. 60% shrugged at how someone holds cutlery. 37% saw no issue with eating before others receive food or sampling from another person’s plate.

The same data tells a different story once dating enters the picture. Reports on the Prezzo survey said 49% of respondents would avoid dating someone with poor table manners. 48% found loud chewing unpleasant. 37% disliked people taking food off their plate. 37% said phone use during meals annoyed them.

Guests downplay etiquette in theory. Guests still judge friends, dates, strangers, and staff by old standards once real stakes appear.

Phones tell a similar story. During Cellphone Courtesy Month in 2025, UScellular promoted survey results on digital behavior. According to a company release, 59% of respondents named phone use during a date as the worst tech etiquette offense, above religious services, family dinners, and trips to the movie theater. Phone on the table still reads as disrespect, even in a culture built on smartphones.

YouGov pushed this further with its April 2024 article on “unwritten rules of eating out.” Large majorities of respondents called snapping fingers for service unacceptable. The same held for debating menu prices with staff, leaving heavy messes on tables, staying past closing, or letting children roam. People claim manners faded. Their own answers say something else.

Your room sits on top of all this unspoken scoring. Staff stand between the surveys and the behavior.

**Tipping Rules Turned Into Noise Instead of Clarity**

Tip screens now pop up everywhere. Coffee counters. Hotel lobbies. Takeout tablets. Grocery store kiosks. People feel surrounded by prompts.

In 2023 Pew Research Center ran a large national survey on tipping expectations. Ideastream Public Media in Ohio summarized results late that year. 72% of adults in the United States said more businesses request tips than five years ago. Only about a third said it feels easy to know when to tip across different situations or how much fits each service.

Yelp’s 2024 Dining Etiquette Report shows an anchor under the noise. According to the coverage, 65% of respondents still leave around 20% at sit-down restaurants as a standard, even with digital prompts everywhere. Consumer Reports published guidance in June 2024 that lined up with long-standing etiquette advice. For full-service restaurants, the article told readers to plan between 15% and 20% on the pre-tax total, with many experts pushing people toward 20%.

Guests feel worn out by prompts. Guests still hold an internal number for full service. Servers and bartenders work in the space between that number and every slider someone in corporate added to the POS.

**Working Rules for Dining Out in 2026**

This is a survival guide for a full book on a Saturday night.

**Phone Behavior**

If you sit with other humans to share a meal, keep phones off the table. Bag, pocket, or face down and away. The FoodNotPhones survey and UScellular research both show strong discomfort with phones during shared meals and especially during dates.

Urgent call or message? Step away, deal with it, return. No speakerphone in the booth. No video chat at the bar. If you want a photo, treat it like grabbing salt. One quick shot when plates hit, then the phone disappears. Yelp’s own etiquette expert tells diners to do exactly this.

Restaurants that prefer stricter standards need clear language. No-phone zones or time windows belong on the site, in confirmations and at the door. If owners leave it vague, hosts and servers end up arguing with guests alone.

**Reservations and Timing**

Show up near your reservation time. YouGov’s restaurant etiquette work shows people in this country lean toward seeing 15-minutes late as rude. Repeated 20-minute delays crush table turns, drive overtime in the kitchen, and turn hosts into punching bags.

Respect cancellation rules. The same YouGov research shows broad support for reasonable no-show fees, especially during peak periods. Guests accept charges when rules appear up front. Staff feel every empty table during prime hours in their paychecks.

**Respect for the Table**

Leave a table, or booth, that a human can reset without a hazmat suit. YouGov’s survey data places “leaving a mess” firmly in the unacceptable column for restaurant guests. Spills, crumbs, and kid fallout show normal life. Deliberate trash piles for someone else to clean show contempt.

Volume matters. Guests know when their group becomes the room. Servers hear the shift before managers do. If leaders never back staff on noise issues, staff stop stepping in. Noise becomes the baseline. Every other standard drops next.

**Kids**

Kids belong in restaurants. Adults who bring them hold the responsibility.

If a child walks, an adult shadows them. Staff move hot plates, glassware, and heavy trays through tight aisles. No one in service should have to hurdle a toddler to keep from burning a stranger. Tablets stay on low volume or use headphones. Screaming happens. Long meltdowns need a break outside.

YouGov’s work on policies shows mixed reactions to “no kids” rules or strict limits, with clear divides by age and income. Some rooms lock in family-friendly service. Some rooms go adults-only after a certain hour. Either path works when the house sticks to it. Drifting policy dumps every argument on the host stand.

**Ordering and Special Requests**

Read menus. Then use servers for guidance, not for debate.

YouGov’s etiquette survey shows support for sending back food when preparation misses. Respondents still see haggling over menu prices with servers as unacceptable. Those number match every veteran server’s sense of fairness.

Reasonable changes keep people fed and safe. Allergy concerns, simple no-cheese or no-nuts requests, sauce on the side, all make sense. Keep in mind that somethings can’t be taken out of an item. Full rewrites crush the line. Turn a composed plate into a personal project, and the board turns into chaos. Ten tables with unique edits means ticket times spike, food cost drifts, and cooks limp through close.

**Time at Table**

If the host explains a 90-minute limit, take it seriously. YouGov’s work shows people in the United States are split on time limits, with more support during peak hours and at busy places. A small room with a long wait needs turnover. Staff never win when owners apologize for rules instead of owning them.

Guests need to read the room. Full lobby. Servers rolling silver near the bar. Floors are already damp from first-pass mopping. Those signs indicate to guests that it’s time to pay and wrap up. Move to the bar if you want one more drink. Turning a table into private property long after dessert is served, and draining tips, keeps staff on their feet.

**Tipping**

Tip what you want. There are no laws about what you tip. I would suggest tipping 20% on the pre-tax total for full-service sit-down restaurants. Bigger tips fit large parties, heavy modifications, or long holds on tables during peak hours. Yelp’s report and Consumer Reports coverage both keep people in that range.

When service fails at a basic respect level, managers need to hear about it. Talk to someone in charge and let them respond. A reduced tip should stay rare, for real disrespect or repeated neglect, not for slow food in an understaffed kitchen or a missed refill when tickets flood in.

**What This Means for People Running the Room**

Owners keep asking whether manners disappeared.

Better questions are, “Who writes behavior rules in your space? Guests who bring their habits from their couch. Or the team in the building every night?”

Every detail in your system sends signals. How strict are you with no-shows? Whether you enforce time limits? How do you train staff to talk about phones? How do you protect servers from roaming kids? Whether managers walk the floor or hide in the office?

YouGov’s research shows strong public agreement on some basics. No snapping at staff. No trashing tables. No debating menu prices with servers. Yelp’s work shows diners still tip near 20% and still feel uneasy about phones at dinner. The Prezzo survey shows Gen Z talks casually about manners until dating enters the room, then shifts back to old rules.

Etiquette didn’t die. It shifted into survey results, training budgets, and quiet judgment across your dining room. Your staff live inside that storm while they run food and reset tables.

Pick a side. Either your restaurant acts like etiquette lives there, or your team works inside a nightly experiment run by strangers. When leaders pick clear standards and back them, staff feel it in their souls, their tips, and their patience.

People walk in for one thing, stay for two minutes, and leave. That tiny window is exactly why digital signage for convenience store environments has quietly become one of the highest-ROI upgrades operators are making right now.

This isn’t about flashy screens for the sake of it. It’s about influencing decisions when customers are already standing in front of the cooler, the counter, or the pump.

# The Real Problem Convenience Stores Face

Most convenience stores deal with the same constraints:

• Limited floor space  
• High product turnover  
• Thin margins on core items  
• Constant price changes  
• Staff that can’t manually update signage all day

Static posters break down fast in that environment. By the time something is printed, it’s already outdated. That’s where convenience store digital signage changes the dynamic not by adding more ads, but by making messaging flexible and timely.

# Where Digital Signage Actually Works in a C-Store

The most effective setups aren’t complicated. They focus on high-decision zones:

Behind the counter  
This is where digital display content shines. Promoting bundles, lottery reminders, or limited-time snacks here directly impacts average ticket size.

Cooler doors and beverage walls  
Motion and short loops outperform printed shelf talkers. A simple animated price callout can outperform a static sign by multiples.

Pump-side screens  
Digital screen advertising companies have shown that fuel-adjacent screens drive in-store visits, especially for drinks and hot food.

Menu boards for quick food  
If the store sells coffee, pizza, or hot items, dynamic pricing and time-based menus matter more than design flair.

# Why Digital Signage Beats Static in Convenience Stores

The advantage isn’t “modern look.” It’s control.

With digital signage for convenience stores, pricing changes can roll out instantly across locations. Promotions can follow time of day. Breakfast offers disappear automatically. Late-night bundles appear without staff touching anything.

That’s where digital signage management software becomes the real asset. The screen is just the surface.

Some operators even start with free digital signage software on a Windows box before scaling to a full signage software for windows setup with centralized control.

# Touch, Data, and What’s Optional

Not every store needs interactivity. Digital signage touch screen software makes sense only when there’s a clear action:

• Self-service ordering  
• Product lookup  
• Loyalty enrollment

For most stores, passive video + smart scheduling outperforms touchscreens. Virtual signs business models that overcomplicate things usually stall.

The winning setups stay boring on purpose short loops, clear pricing, one message per screen.

# Integration Reality (What People Don’t Talk About)

A lot of store owners get stuck choosing platforms. Some experiment with optisigns support or check optisigns login dashboards because it’s accessible. Others jump straight to managed platforms.

The deciding factor usually isn’t features it’s reliability and how fast someone can update 20 screens when prices change at 6 a.m.

That’s also why many stores lean toward commercial digital sign hardware instead of consumer TVs. Commercial digital signs are built to stay on all day, every day, without babysitting.

# Advertising vs In-Store Control

There’s a big difference between:

• Digital screen advertising companies selling ad slots  
• Stores controlling their own digital commercial signs

External ads can work, but only if they don’t interfere with pricing clarity. Most high-performing stores keep primary screens under their own control and monetize secondary placements later.

According to [Digital Signage Today](https://www.digitalsignagetoday.com), convenience retail screens tied to promotions and pricing outperform third-party ads by a wide margin in conversion.

# What Actually Converts

Across multiple store formats, these patterns repeat:

• Motion beats static every time  
• Fewer messages outperform clutter  
• Time-based scheduling matters more than design  
• Price clarity drives trust  
• Consistency across locations increases recall

Digital signage companies in Canada and the US report that stores focusing on operational signage not branding see faster ROI.

# Digital Signage For Convenience Store Powered By AIScreen

AIScreen provides a digital signage system built specifically for fast-moving retail environments like convenience stores, where pricing, promotions, and product availability change constantly. 

With AIScreen, convenience store operators can manage digital signage for convenience store locations from one dashboard, push real-time updates to digital displays, schedule content by time of day, and keep commercial digital signs running reliably without staff intervention. 

This makes AIScreen a practical choice for stores that need a stable digital signage management software to control multiple screens, locations, and promotions at scale.

# The Takeaway

Digital signage for convenience store environments works when it’s treated as an operational tool, not a marketing experiment.

If screens help customers decide faster, staff work less, and prices stay accurate, they pay for themselves. If they try to do everything at once, they fail.

What’s interesting is how many store owners only realize this after testing one screen behind the counter and seeing basket size change within weeks.

For stores that have already tried digital signage in a pharmacy or quick-service setting, did the same patterns show up in convenience retail? Or did something else work better?",1,1770233339.0,u_AIScreen_Inc,0,1.0,False

I had 2 days of heavy bleeding post miscarriage. Then very scant bleeding. Then it picked back up on day 4 to 6. Then it stopped with light brown bleeding. Occasionally I will see red in the toilet bowl when I pee. 

Day 10 I had a womb massage and immediately after the massage felt a gush..checked and saw coffee ground bleeding on the pad. I pee and the whole bowl looks red again. As if it's my first day of miscarriage. I also caught a hard blood clot. Sized of a grape. 

I started to cramp badly throughout the day but theres only brown mucusy expel when I pee and I did not bleed till now. 

It's day 11 post miscarriage, 3am..I can't sleep because of cramps. When to the toilet and saw bleeding brownish red on pad..when I peed I saw red stringy discharge and small clots. Tmi and I pooped too. The cramp lessen but still there. 

Is the doctor wrong and I actually have RPOC? I ask the doctor after the scan and she said she can't see any. What am I passing still? 

I can't sleep because of the cramp but mainly because of the anxiety of not knowing when this will end..I'm due to be back at work in 4 more days.

1qvy6af,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1qvy6af/how_you_can_study_more_than_you_currently_are/,How you can study more than you currently are,"A lot of advice about studying more focuses on motivation or discipline.

From what we’ve seen working with students, the bigger issue is usually structure, not effort.  
Most people don’t stop because they’re lazy - they stop because they hit a very predictable focus ceiling. Often around 90–120 minutes, attention drops, mistakes increase, and “studying” quietly turns into rereading, phone checks, or procrastination.

What actually helps extend study time tends to be simple things, but you do have to be serious about learning:  
  
\- Decide your break before you start  
Example: “After 90 minutes, I stand up, stretch, and drink water for 5 minutes.”  
This is better than scrolling your phone without noticing.

\- Keep breaks short and boring  
No TikTok or YouTube.  
Just walk, stretch, breathe, or look outside.

\- Switch tasks when your brain feels tired  
If reading feels impossible, switch to reviewing notes, doing practice questions, or organizing material.

\- Fuel your body properly  
Avoid too many carbs, stay hydrated and replace your energy drink or cups of coffee with proper study fuel.  


Put simply - studying longer isn't about motivation, it's about working with your brain, and helping it help you:)

If you read until the end, it shows you really care about doing better. Can't wait to see you crushing it and have a great study week<3",14,1770233130.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False

1qvxyc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qvxyc9/8_thats_all_im_worth_now/,8€. That's all I'm worth now.,"(F, 25, Europe)

I grew up poor (no-eating poor), that's the only life I know. I'm the last child of 6 sisters, the only one who really wanted to study, so as a child I fed myself with these illusions of working my ass off and taking care of my family. Didn't want a mansion, not a million dollars, no riches, no jewelry, no luxury: I wanted to never hear my parents stressing night after night on what we were going to eat. Hell, I didn't even wish for my parents to own a house, I dreamt about them living in one and be able to pay rent AND go out and have a coffee every now and then without worrying about those 3€. 
When I decided I wanted to go to uni I told my parents, and they told me they would help me however they could, but they just couldn't, so if I wanted to study, I had to work for it. I knew that already, and I never had any problem with it. I studied two degrees, worked and studied, never did any ""university-experience"" plans (no parties, no little trips, not even going to the cinema, I couldn't spare the 7 euros that the ticket costed). I was EXHAUSTED, worked at bartending jobs that paid me almost nothing, having to deal on a daily basis with derogatory comments about my sexuality at work (I'm a lesbian), having epileptic seizures every TWO DAYS because I slept only a few hours. I suffered every day, but I was honoring my dreams, I was following the life I wanted to build, the life I dreamt about as a child. I was tired, frustrated and lonely, but I knew it would all be worthy someday. 
Now I'm 25. I have two degrees, a Bootcamp in UX/UI, currently studying a master's degree in full stack development. I've been disemployed for 11 months now. Living with my parents (and incredibly grateful that I have a room for myself, running water and food on the table, don't get me wrong), in a city - we had to move to because my hometown got way too expensive - where I don't have any friends. 
Today I went to my first job interview in the longest time. It's a bar. I told myself I would never take these jobs again: I have chronic tendinitis in my right wrist, bartending makes it so much worse. But what can I say? I have absolutely no right to complain. This is my first interview in almost a year. I'm grateful, really, I am, and I know those fantasies you make up as a child are delusional, but man. I don't see hope in my future. 
I want to be a mother someday. Always have. Will I ever bee able to do that? Will I ever be able to provide stability to my kids? I grew up without one, and I'm not willing to do that to another human being if I can avoid it.
I decided I wanted to be a UX/UI designer. I got myself a huge debt to pay for that. I studied. I practiced. I did good. That's the career I wanna follow. Now? I can't even build a damn portfolio of my own, because I cannot afford 20 fucking euros for the Figma subscription. 
Tomorrow I have a ""try day"" at this new job. 4 hours. 8 euros an hour.
So yeah, that's all I am now. Once an ace student, the bright child, the stay-all-night-studying girl, the working student, someone with a bright future ahead, they all said. The reality? 8 euros. That's what I am worth.

Most people think articulation is just about speaking clearly, but speech therapists and communication researchers have found it's actually about training your mouth muscles and breath control. I dove deep into resources from speech pathology research, linguistics podcasts, and communication coaches. The techniques I'm sharing come from actual speech therapy practices, not some motivational BS.



Here's the thing. Your articulation struggles aren't because you're inherently bad at speaking. It's because modern life doesn't require us to use our facial muscles much anymore. We text instead of talk. We consume content passively. Our mouths literally become lazy. But neuroscience shows us that with targeted practice, you can rewire those neural pathways fast.



The Exaggeration Method is something speech therapists use with actors and public speakers. You deliberately over-pronounce every syllable of what you're saying, making your mouth movements almost cartoonishly large. Pick any paragraph from a book and read it out loud, moving your lips and jaw way more than feels natural. It feels ridiculous at first but stick with it for five minutes daily. Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses similar motor learning principles on his [podcast](https://www.hubermanlab.com/all-episodes), explaining how exaggerated practice creates stronger neural patterns. When you return to normal speech, your articulation becomes noticeably crisper because you've expanded your range of motion.



Tongue Twisters with Purpose comes next. But here's the twist, you're not just racing through them. Speech pathologists recommend starting at half speed, focusing on hitting every consonant cleanly. ""The lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue"" repeated slowly builds muscle memory. Once you nail it slowly, gradually increase speed. The book ""[The Art of Voice Acting](https://archive.org/details/artofvoiceacting0000albu_o4r9)"" by James Alburger breaks down why this works. Alburger spent decades training voice actors and this is one of his core techniques. The book is packed with exercises that professional speakers use daily. It'll make you realize how much control you actually have over your voice once you train it properly. Insanely practical read with zero fluff.



Breath Support Training is the final piece most people ignore. Your articulation falls apart when you run out of air mid-sentence. Practice speaking from your diaphragm by placing your hand on your stomach and ensuring it expands when you breathe in, not your chest. Then practice reading sentences on a single breath, gradually increasing length. This forces you to manage air efficiently. 



The app Orai is actually brilliant for this, it analyzes your speech patterns in real time and gives feedback on pace, filler words, and energy. You record yourself speaking and it breaks down exactly where you're losing clarity. Much better than guessing at your weak points.



For those who want to go deeper into communication skills beyond just articulation, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450), a personalized audio learning app that pulls from speech coaching resources, communication research, and expert insights to build a structured learning plan around your specific goals. If you're working on becoming more articulate as someone who's naturally soft-spoken or introverted, you can tell it exactly that, and it creates a tailored plan that evolves with your progress. It converts content from books like ""The Art of Voice Acting,"" speech therapy research, and expert talks into customized podcasts you can adjust from quick 10-minute summaries to detailed 40-minute deep dives. You can pick voices that keep you engaged, even a sarcastic or energetic tone if that helps you stay focused during a commute or workout. Makes the whole learning process way more structured and easier to stick with.



The crazy part? You'll notice improvements within days, not months. Your brain adapts to new motor patterns surprisingly fast when you practice deliberately. I started getting compliments on how I expressed myself. People actually leaned in during conversations instead of politely nodding while clearly not catching half of what I said.



Combine these three exercises for ten minutes daily. That's it. Do them while cooking, during your commute, whenever. The consistency matters more than perfection. Speech is just another skill, and like any skill, targeted practice rewires your capabilities. Your mouth is capable of way more precision than you're currently using.

Synopsis:  Engine 147 of New Mary's HFD (Hellfire Department) is assigned to a domestic home fire. The sundry crew (Rhodes, Lunch, Papp, The Preacher, and The Chief) respond to the supernatural flames with the intent to control the demonic blaze and rescue those trapped inside. However, all hell breaks loose as they discover the idyllic park view home has been breached by the other side. 

  


**Hellfire Department:** 

**Breach on Beal Street**



**PART I**



Modern high-rises and traffic exhaust guard the handsome Old Edwards Fire Company in New Mary’s Downtown. Ol’ Ed was originally constructed in 1956 by the city’s local bricklaying and masonry chapter. The orange brick was harvested in the nearby quarry and was set to gorgeously sink subtle warmth below a gothic facade of webbed terracotta. Its crowning jewel, its fire mark. A sculpture of a lioness bathing between its reinforced bay doors. Though it now stands as the sole structure of just two stories for 15 blocks, Ol’ Ed’s short face is highly regarded for its precious architectural detailing and artistry, and so, is therefore deemed a historical landmark by the state preservation office. With the determinant stipulation of it forever proudly serving the city’s bravest heroes, New Mary’s HFD (NMHFD).

 

“Christ, Lunch. Pinch it off already.” Rhodes said, tap dancing with his legs crossed

.

“I’m pushing a grapefruit.” Lunch moaned back, bracing himself. 



“Flush. Goddamn it, Lunch!” Rhodes shouted and punched the bathroom door. 



The Chief called from the dining room. “What’s going on?” 



“Lunch has been making the mud for forty minutes.” The young firefighter tattled. 



“I’mma make a smiley face.” Lunch taunted, wiggling on the seat.



Rhodes stormed through the dormitory, and kicked open the exit door.

“Jesus, alright I’m pissing in the alley.”



Three men occupied the small, adjacent dining room that the fumes slowly wafted toward.

The preacher plugged his nose, “Blessed, Lord. Help these men. They’re degenerates."" 



Papp stuck his head out from the pantry, “What was that, Thumper?” 



The preacher squeaked the beginning of a retort, but then instead sheepishly sucked at his coffee’s brim. He sat opposite of The Chief in the well-lived common room. The decor was a mesh of amenities from the 90s that made it feel exactly like a family living room: warm vinyls and subtle lights, a collection of donated wood furniture, a fine knit geometric rug trampled to clumps. The Chief sat postured and aligned some reports on the old oak table. “Cool it, Papp.” He said without a glance.

Papp garbled his apologies, “Sorry, Chief.”



“Reverend.” The Chief continued, “Thank you for doing the dishes.” 



“Welcome.”



Lunch boomed in triumphant release, “Mother of New Mary! God is good, Papp. God is good!”



The preacher muttered, “You gentlemen truly need a revival. Does God's name mean nothing?” 



Papp rolled his perpetually tired eyes, gave the man of God a nonchalant bird, and returned to finding his sugared cornflakes. “This bread’s expired. Bananas stink. Does anything keep in here?” 



The preacher sniffed and was immediately stifled. Struggling to inhale, the preacher asked, “How’s the young man related to Lunch again?”



Papp replied, “Brother-In-Law.”



“Ah, Johanna’s little brother. When was he procured?”



Lunch called out from the can, “He ain’t a lil’ squishy, just transferred off a spot ladder.”



The Chief commented, confidently, “9 months listed. No official errors. No infractions.”



“Johanna’s idea of protecting you?” The preacher inquired.



Lunch ripped a fart into the bowl in response. “Yeah, right. That’s backwards!” 



The Chief flexed the papers, snapped them stiff and read with a squint, 

“Papp, you check the pumps? Clean the hose bed?” 



Papp said proudly. “Hit it early, Chief. Pulled stacks, sanitized, cross-laid back with loops. Done and done.” 



The Chief tufted an acknowledgement. Papps poured breakfast into a bowl and saddled a chair. The Chief stood to attention, made his way at Lunch, and hammered the bathroom door with a single solid blow.  He commanded, “Lunch, reloads on 1 and check the tanks.”



Lunch grunted “Aye, Aye.” 



The Chief coughed, “And maybe change up your diet, son.”



Lunch replied breathlessly, “Sorry but I got to purge. Can’t take this diesel with me.”



The Chief hung his head briefly before stepping away. “Yo, Bossman, can we get another crapper?” Lunch asked with a muted flush, “We got too many kings, not enough thrones.” 



The Chief evenly replied, before making toward his office, “Again. No. Ol’ Ed is all natural.”



Papp waited until The Chief rounded the corner, then cheekily asked. “Preach, your Ma’s all natural, right?” 



The alarm rang. 



A repeating double beat filled the station. The robotic enunciation of E147 and a staticky jumbled response location followed, a trailing alert on the LED board read clear. *E147 Beal Street, Residential Fire.* A voice from emergency dispatch followed, “At this time, full crew orders for a single family three story. EMTs onsite.” 



Papp raced to the slide pole. He clutched the metal bar and the preacher watched his head swiftly dip below the floor. The preacher briskly slipped into the dormitory. He removed his tie then pulled a silver chain laced Bible from his bunk and followed promptly down the stairs. The bathroom door flew open. Lunch fell out his stench, tumbling to the stairs and snapping his loose suspenders into place. 



Rhodes had the bay open, and secured the driver’s seat before Lunch could protest. The Chief was booting up and taking watch as everyone entered the truck. Papp kicked in an inventory compartment and swung open the cab. Lunch hiked up and pulled the preacher. The Chief took the front passenger’s seat and hit the lights. Headsets on. Rhodes tugged the rope, blasting the air horn. The Chief flipped the siren. They turned clear through 6 lanes, and it was “Engine 147 in route.” 



“What’s local medicine looking at?” Lunch asked over the radio.



“Talking to them now, hold tight.” The Chief dismissed, before tuning back to the main channel. 



“Wait. No Bugtoe today?” Lunch questioned Papp, who was sitting in the transverse seat.



Papp pulled the mic to his mouth, “Nah, he’s home. Man did 24 straight for E108, backfill for that 

Charles guy.” 



Lunch scrunched his face. “Charles who?” 



“The one that died.” Papp replied.



The preacher, who sat across the aisle with the gear, turned his head at attention. “What Charles died? Ain’t no Charles at the 108.”



Papp rolled his lip out. “Not no more. They responded to a Ringforker at a bank on Kings last week. Made him manic, then his heart stopped.” Suddenly, the preacher’s eyes widened. Papp went on, “You sure you didn't know this dude? They all called him something stupid.” 



Rhodes enlightened him, arms extended on the large steering wheel, “He’s talking about Clod, their special ops man.” 



“Oh shit, yeah I knew him.” Lunch put his greasy palm on his scalp and pushed his long wiry hair back. He squeezed his temples and shook his head in shock, “Fuck, he died? Great dude. Hell of an axeman. Strong as shit. Ya know, they used to shut down the city for a tragedy like that.” 



Papp slouched to a window and watched the red lights wash out passing faces. He traced the citizen’s motion blurred dread. “Fourth gone this year. No one wants another memorial. We’re just reminders now.” 



The preacher thumbed through the chain-link on his Bible to touch the heat resistant wool undercoating. “It’s getting worse.” He said, the words heavily dropping out of him. 



Papp turned to the preacher but asked Lunch, “You know if 108 is open to swapping preachers?” 



Lunch chuckled, “Lay off the holy man now. Body and soul, he’s gentle.” 



Papp gave the preacher a look of disgust, “He called us degenerates earlier.” 



“Well I am.” Lunch grinned, winking. “The freshmen up front too, devilish and sly. Taking my turn in the fun seat, brother?”



“You can drive on the way back.” Rhodes chimed in. “Unless Papp wants a go?” 



“Pass.” Papp shot back.

  


Lunch leaned sideways and nudged the preacher. “Hey, Preacher.”



“Yes.” He replied evenly.



“Hypothetical for you. I’ve got a gun to my head. I need you to say a slur to save my life, would you do it?” The preacher looked at him bewildered. “Look, right. I know about those missionaries that like to die before renouncing their faith. That’s cool, I respect it. You do that, I get it. But would you say some crazy racist shit about like… Guatemalans? You know, to save my life.” Papp studied Lunch, while Lunch waited for a response. “You don’t have to mean it, you’d just have to say it.” The preacher was absolutely stunned by the question. 



Then the engine bounced off the connecting bridge and The Chief announced, “One minute out. Cut the chatter.” He turned to make eye contact with the darkened cab. “Focus up. EMTs have one civilian out in a shocked condition, maybe three more believed inside. Teenager on the second story, parent on the third.”



Comms went quiet after that. The preacher went into The Word. Lunch sent a few cautious texts to his usual people. Papp went back to the window, watching the local police coming into view. They scurried to set a perimeter. One of the officer’s gave him a firm nod, Papp nodded back absently. Rhodes pulled the truck down a one-way bend and their cherry reflections rose and sank, up/down and back against the transitioning glass panes of emptying businesses and apartment buildings.



Coming off the corner, they dumped onto a burning glow. Down the initial set of fetching 3-flats, facing the shrub fenced park, was a building made of flames. The heat dominated the air and rose as they barreled headlong to arrive. They walled off the ambulance from the house in a swift swinging park and all the doors opened in sync. Papp and Rhodes, exiting closest to the home, briefly paused together. They looked up stone steps to the small white front door in a rage of pure flames. 



“Whole things burning. No smoke.” Rhodes commented. 



“Yeah, it’s ours.” Papp decided.



As his boots hit the asphalt, The Chief barked orders. “Compartments open. Rhodes, you’re on hose. Tap the hydrant. Rig down, boom up. No movement without a pin test. Papp and Lunch you're knocking. Reverend, standby, coat and hat please.” The Chief marched over to a soot smothered child being comforted by EMTs. 



The men each went to lift and roll out a compartment. Rhodes got the spanner wrench. The preacher adorned a thick repellent cloak and helmet stitched and etched respectfully with a Celtic cross. Papp and Lunch dressed in standard HFD turnouts: helmet and eye shield, particulate blocking hoods patterned in daisy wheels, breathing apparatus (with tanks), and heather lined protective coats packed with personal quick equipment. Lunch inserted a brass key into the back of the truck and pulled down the weapons compartment. Racked on the galvanized panel were four pump action shotguns, multiple wire mesh cages below were filled with munitions. 



Papp clocked Rhodes’ shadow spreading below him as the boy ascended the ladder. “Pressure!” 



Rhodes shouted, shifting the valve handle. A second later the hose kicked, wriggled and gushed with water. Rhodes drenched a single flaming spread for a few moments and the crew watched anxiously. The Chief moved briskly back to them and motioned for Rhodes to kill the stream. Rhodes hit the shut-off and the spout went to a drip. As gushing water fell off, it revealed the fire raging unabated. The small square that was blasted had remained ablaze, the water had no effect. 



“Reverend, please assist.” The Chief requested. 



The preacher widened the silver chain necklace to adorn his Bible. He purposefully made his way to the hydrant. The preacher then closed his eyes. Bowing his head, he placed both hands on the bonnet and began to request blessings. The Chief pointed to Rhodes and the water cannon blasted once again. This time the blistering flames washed away with a simple passing. The home beneath was revealed, entirely undamaged.



“Nice work, Jesus wizard.” Lunch yelled in earnest. 



Rhodes made a quick rinse of the porch, taking the heat off their entrance. The flames disappeared without a hazy film or wavy smoke, only white sizzling bubbles. The door held, as it should, completely unaffected by the fire - inviting as ever. 



“Chief, anything from the kid?” Papp asked. 



“Nothing concrete. He’s shaken, nonverbal. EMTs only got him to nod. Mother and older brother are confirmed inside. No mention of the father.” 



“Names?”



“I’ve asked dispatch for a bio on the family. Waiting.”



Lunch pointed to the munition boxes, “Shells?” 



The Chief noticed his doubt, answering, “Load salt, full lead in a bando. Papp, slugs in a cold pack. Bring a hitter. I’ll be on exit duty.” Lunch reached over Papp, tugged a drawer and pulled out a trench knife. Papp crossed over him to retrieve the axe. The Chief equipped his fire retardant Wildland and stowed a small arm in his holster. Rhodes fanned a protective mist and the preacher dutifully muttered his prayers. 



They were ready to enter. 



**PART II**



Papp and Lunch took cautious steps to the front door, glancing inside the ornate green glass pane sidelights. Lunch pressed down on the gold plated handle and the door tamely opened. Both men were silent in their confusion for the eerily undisturbed bottom floor of the home. It wasn’t smoking of course. But also there was no fire, no heat. It seemed to ultimately be untouched by what was sure to be within. However, they recognized something more solemn about the space. They stood in the short foyer, an open L shaped kitchen to their right and a dimly lit living room to their left. The furniture was expensive. The interior design, that of the typical upper middle. Yet all of it was abandoned and cluttered. Like, no one had cleaned in months. It was difficult to see the floor in the mess; some of it was household trash, some thrown clothes, some mail. What little floor was visible, was caked in grime.



Lunch announced, “HFD Fire Rescue! Come out. We are here to help!”



The adjoined space made no reply, if anything it felt as if the house withdrew and became quieter. Lunch stepped in further, his heavy boots creaking the natural teak and shuffling garbage. Papp flanked twisting, scanning the nearest rooms and their shadowing corners and halls. In doing so he saw the ribbon wrapped frame on the dusty living room mantle. It was a stoic portrait of a suited middle-aged man. He had a high tight trim, becoming eyes and a sharp jawline. The man’s name was on a slab below, Clive Fraley. In a smaller 8x10 just next to it was the full family photo. The background was the classic brushed blue backdrop. It was the memorialized stoic dad, a hip-tied shorthaired blonde woman, a pale bulky teenager with a sad scowl and the child outside, only clean and smiling pearls. Papp, following a trail of wilted petals, found a blackened bouquet slumped by an open urn. 



“Chief. Found a name, Clive Fraley.” Papp called softly.



The Chief was chocking the front door when he looked up and traced Papp’s concern. The Chief furrowed, flatly replying, “Yeah, we’ll assume the father’s passed. Possible summon, I’ll call it in.” He turned to another radio channel and stepped onto the porch. 



The two firefighters inside pressed on. Lunch called out again, “HFD Fire Rescue!”



Entering the living room, they could now see the orange firelight spilling from the angled staircase along the far rear wall. At the landing, they could see a flight of untouched stairs and a perfectly horizontal ceiling of raging flames. Lunch spoke into his radio, “Vent and douse the center window on the second floor.” 



“Copy”, Rhodes replied.

Rhodes adjusted his aim and tightened the dial. The water funneled in from a wide shower to a powerful hydro jet, shattering the target window. The mechanical ladder whined as he sent it forward, Rhodes steadied the bucket and flushed the upstairs hallway with holy water. With each droplet the unnatural fire peeled away and vanished in a sizzling steam. Rhodes cut a path to the stairs, ricocheting a scatter from the railing. He reset the bail and called back, “2nd floor hall clear.”



Rhodes watched the preacher and acted on his curiosity while Papp and Lunch ascended inside, “You able to talk while you do that?”



The preacher politely consented, “So long as my concentration is unbroken, I can.”



Rhodes tapped his chest strapped radio and faintly inquired, “What’s up with Papp? You two got history?”



The preacher responded head locked downward, “From what I know he has always had a grievance with people of faith. I am simply the nearest.”



Rhodes opened the dial and rained down on the house once again. “He’s saying some pretty rude shit. You ok? Want me to rough him up?” Rhodes asked, in playful concern.



“More than okay. No horseplay on my account. There are better ways, Private Rhodes.” The preacher said with a slight consideration. 



“Happy to hear it. Wasn't sure I could take an ex-cop.” Rhodes admitted.



“Papp was a policeman?” The preacher asked in mild surprise.



 “Oh, yeah. Lunch told me. Discharged beat cop to HFD.” Rhodes said nonchalantly. The preacher recognized the new information by emitting a light intrigued hmm. Rhodes concurred with a shrug before his next question, “Scripture question for you, Mr. Preacher. Why no smoke?”



The preacher bobbled his head in the manner long debated, over-examined, and stale topics can incite, “When I meet God I will ask that myself.”



“Venture a theory?” 



“Of my interpretation and a prevalent understanding in my church-” The preacher creaked out.



“There is no smoke in hell because it was never intended for consumption. Hellfire burns solely to cause pain, to let the fire burn out would be a relief in a place without relief.”



The Chief hollered over the radio, “E3014 will be here in 25 with a containment truck. Proceed with extraction, use extreme caution. Listen. Dispatch came back with family names. Father: Clive Fraley, two months deceased. Mother: Jane Fraley, inside. Eldest Son: Collin, inside, age 16. Youngest Son: Palmer, outside with paramedics, age 6. Neither Jane nor the children have been to work or school since the father’s passing.” The Chief signaled to Rhodes before hiking over a flowerbed with a paint pen and bucket of salt.



Papps and Lunch pinged back, “Roger. On the second floor now.”  



The flames were mostly defeated and the upstairs hall was clear. Sounds of sizzling faded as the water set. Rhodes and Papp progressed shoulder to shoulder, minding the small fires clinging to their dry nooks where the hose hadn’t hit. The hall runner squelched with their steps.



Lunch shouted for them, “Jane! Collin! FHD Rescue, please respond!”



Behind Papp was another angled staircase to the third floor. They passed a bedroom, door ajar. Tonka trucks and action figures lined the base boards. Rocket ships were on the wallpaper and bedspread. Vacant. Lunch designated it as the youngest child’s room. Halfway down the hall, Papp slid open a pair of accordion doors to reveal a washer and dryer closet. They then turned in unison at the door opposite and tried the knob.



Even through his glove, Papp felt the painful temperature. “Locked. Inner walls lit.” He announced. 



Lunch cupped the radio, “Rhodes, hose through the window. We’re gonna drawbridge a lit room.”



Rhodes turned, shuffled down the ladder and asked the preacher to kill pressure. On his descent, Rhodes noticed The Chief on all fours back at the front door, he wielded the paint pen determinately. He was remarkably focused on finishing his wide curving symbol at the threshold. The preacher leaned all his weight into the spanner and the hose deflated. Rhodes yanked on the stack, got slack and proceeded back up the ladder. 



By the time he was back to the window Papp had a Halligan wedged in the upper hinge. Lunch crashed into the shaft and the wood split clean. Escaping flames jumped from the small crack overhead.



Rhodes signaled, “Hose coming in.”



Lunch quickly walked down the hall and met him at the window. He flicked the young firefighters visor and laughed, “Thanks kid.”



Rhodes adjusted himself and began to feed the line as Lunch moved into stance. Papp teed up the Halligan again and equipped his axe before stepping to the door’s side, “Ready.” 



“Preach.” Lunch directed. “Pressure and a prayer.”



The girthy hose swelled and the preacher replied humbly, “Okay.” 

 

Papp nodded to Lunch. His axe butt swung high, dropped in and drove the claw deep. He crouched, grasped the long arm of the Halligan and pulled back. The bottom hinge snapped and the door broke off the wall. The door stood, briefly, balancing on the wood floor. Lunch opened the hose and blasted the top of the door as flames erupted out, he then kicked high on the freed door and soaked it as it collapsed inward. 



Lunch drenched the floor and extinguished the nearest flames. He pinched the line at the bail as the steam cleared. Papp clipped his entry tool to his hip mounted cradle and stood, axe in hand. He tapped Lunch and stepped before him, announcing with a square designation, “HFD Fire Rescue.”



The sleeping section of the bedroom was tucked just off a lefthand half-bath. And so, it remained obscured in high and steady flame. While the other section was a mush mound of wet food, trash and clothes. The hose soaked bulbous, sagging pockets of water into the wall paint. A PC monitor flickered out. Band posters turned to a grey pulp on the hardwood. Papp did a visual sweep. Making assumptions of the boy whose safe haven he infiltrated. He saw drawing pens, a basketball. And, oddly, a string of smashed pictures and trophies on a small desk. He turned to face the flaming bed.



With some scrutiny, he tragically identified a mass. There, in the engulfed mattress was something the rough dimensions of that teenager pictured downstairs.  Disappointment on his face, he fanned Lunch in to extinguish the corpse. However, he swiftly held up a straight halt signal as he heard a heavy thud.



There were another two dense thumps of things longer and lower to the floor. Followed by a clapping and scratching that was frantic and strained. Papp braised, raising his axe as they crawled out the fire. 



A filleted arm pulled itself on bright blisters, bulging under splitting nails. It was severed from a shoulder, a person, but fleeing desperately toward Papp. Like the other skinless arm, another quivered and scraped from the flames. The disembodied appendages moved with an agonizing tremor to his slowly retreating feet, an ooze of blood trailed from their twisted rip wounds. Papp stealthy sheathed his axe on his free hip cradle and pulled out his shotgun. Lunch stamped in just as the head rolled out from under the burning bed. 



It was the Collin’s cooking head, severed and wobbling forward on its side. The lower cheek was a sludgy stretch of flesh that squished as it rocked. His eyes were not the pair pictured earlier. They were ash rimmed and nearly doubled in size, bulging with blood. Two protruding oblong tomatoes sinking in a horrid grey pit locked onto Papp. There were quick rapid breaths coming from the mouth.



It gasped and spoke gauntly, “***RICH***”. It groaned, pulling itself along the ground with a flex of its jaw. The head bounced closer, drooling, it grumbled, “***SOIL.***”



Right then, Lunch was ready to turn water on the body pieces. When from out the flames of the burning bed, a wedge-shaped pit of teeth undulated on a long outstretched neck. Without warning it placed a winding mesh of meaty tubulars to the floor and thrust its body at Papp. 



Papp leapt straight back and hip-fired a shot into it. 



Salt exploded into the thing, white dots scattered into a sizzle on the rising hulk of it. Unflinched, the fullness of it dropped to the floor and the house shook, bowing in its terror. Its obscured proportions shifted into a grandly dense strata of bloody tissue. It was cinched on hooked talons that drove cuts with each step. Its exposed heel bone jutted through its warped flesh to a jagged pike, like a predatory animal with a gruesome compound fracture. It had a hardened pack of flesh looped from out and back in its sinewy center mass that swung brutally down to try to crush Papp. 



He leapt back, further to the corner, narrowly escaping the deadly blow.  



As it rallied momentum for another swipe, Papp saw its center mass more clearly. It was the burly teenager's suspended torso, overturned and utterly ruptured. Guts dangled from a burrowed belly cavity. The malicious wrapping of tissue on pulsing muscle had ripped through Collin's torso like the roots of a grisly meat tree on fleshy soil. It was a system of sick chutes, barded and burnt and, in some places, chomping. Like the tumultuous mating balls of venomous snakes… but on fire. The smallest of its extensions were razored tendrils, sprung from the thinnest skin tears of his abdomen. The monster's raw fire basted mass and the dying stumps of the pieces viciously torn away were woven into a single clotted knot.



The Chief’s steady voice buzzed, “Status. Report on discharge.”



Papp replied indistinctly, “Fleshroot. Call birds. It’s huge.”



The Chief radioed immediately, “Sigils set. Retreat.”



Nervously, Papp saw his exit shrinking as it lumbered forward. The Fleshroot’s heaviness, it’s wild incessantly wiggling limbs - it was primed to engulf him. The instantaneous ejection of holy water was an audible blessing.



A tight wet cord drilled into the meat mass and from the swinging maw-like wedge it screeched noxiously. Lunch screamed, “Move out!” while resisting the hose's kick. 



A raging blast escaped the dialed valve. It was set at two inches in diameter. Its most focused,  most weaponized setting. The nozzle pressure was high enough to slit the skin of a man. At the right distance, it was sufficiently lethal to people. To an infernal brute, it was a high powered laser capable of eternal nonexistence.



Papp hardly had time to chamber another shell before it happened. A bursting block of angry flesh rushed Lunch at the door, pushing against the stream of holy water as its layers of red writhing meat steamed and popped. Boiling hot water exploded in every direction. Lunch recoiled to the hallway, spraying desperately. But, it was too dense, too late. From a fizzling mist, the monster lunged feral, crumbling the doorframe to a rubbled gap. In quick succession, the Fleshroot charged. It rammed Lunch, sending a full geared 250lb man careening into the tall white washing machine across the hall. It pushed, bore down on him. Meaty channels sieged his arms and coiled for his throat. Lunch squirmed and kicked, his body weighed on by near tons while under the gushing stew of broiling demonic tissue. His wails of pain were relieved only by the echoing blast of Papp's shotgun. 



Papp punched a hole into the monster’s assumed back, rapidly pumping; he fired another shot to fill the hole with ejected pellets of hot salt. The Fleshroot screeched louder, steam wafting from the tangled form. In a rage, it released Lunch and hurled its looping extension of chutes backward, hitting Papp’s chest and knocking him stunned and sliding. Lunch, rickety, concussed, and gasping, found footing, and pushed the nozzle further to it. Steam fogged his visor, its running juices bathed his gear and sautéed the small gap of exposed skin under his gaiter. Visibility was low, but he could hear the sound of the water gushing, the nozzle swashing as it slipped against the horrid swarms of gut-like appendages. 



The Fleshroot pounced in challenge, ensnaring Lunch in a web of itself. It tied and bound him, a bloody fire-singed red slipped circles on him. His grip slacked and the hose tumbled out Lunch’s hands. It suspended him in the air, stringing him high. In ferocious anger it plowed forward and blindly slammed Lunch down atop the washing machine. A denting bang sounded as Lunch’s tank crushed the top loader door. Papp heard him groan. The sound was followed by a low hollow pop. In a cacophony of deafening cracks and booms, the floor splintered and caved. Lunch, the writhing monster and the washing machine dropped.



Papp staggered up, his friend gone. The firehose laid streaming at his feet. He moved to the torn opening in the hall closet and peered down. There was a shrouding stir of varicolored dust. The 

Chief hollered, “Report!”



Rhodes was quick on the radio, “Chief, Papp is moving. I can't see Lunch from the window.”



Papp responded, “Joists gave! Lunch is on the ground floor.”



The Chief replied sharply, “Copy. Going in. Rhodes, escort EMS and bring a board.”



The wind was ruffling Rhodes mic as he hurried down the ladder, “Copy.”",1,1770232125.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

***Confessions of an Ex-Scientologist Pothead: Born in. Sparked up. Got out.***

From her first breath, Liz is destined for life within the mysterious world of Scientology. Indoctrination lurks behind every corner as she shuffles between an elite boarding school, eccentric churches and a family of true believers.

Liz Gale delivers an enthralling account of growing up a third generation Scientologist, the mind-bending secret scriptures that dictated her upbringing and the haunting scandals that gave her courage to break free.

After growing up in a cult, leaving and losing everything, [**Liz Gale**](https://liz-gale.com/) made one promise to herself: to live a creative life. Whether it’s providing cult education on social media, in writing her ongoing series *Confessions of an Ex-Scientologist,* or making funny videos about mind-control, Liz approaches complex concepts, terms and experiences in a fun, conversational tone.

Born a bicentennial Taurus, Fire Dragon, and proud member of Generation X—with a Cult cherry on top. After a lifetime of coercion, [**Nora Ames**](https://www.youtube.com/@TheRagingBuddha) signed Scientology’s so-called billion-year contract and spent five years in indentured servitude to its Celebrity courtesans. She was ultimately sent to a Scientology prison labor camp for being gay. Since her escape, Nora has become an outspoken advocate, dedicated to exposing the truth about Scientology’s abuses and crimes.

1qvxlds,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantAndVentPH/comments/1qvxlds/lazboy_is_terrible/,La-Z-Boy is terrible,"On November 29, I purchased a James power reclining loveseat that had to be custom ordered because the desired fabric and color were not in stock.

On January 21, we received the loveseat. Immediately upon use, it began creaking and popping when sitting or reclining, and it is significantly less comfortable than the showroom model. In fact, the loveseat causes me back pain, making it difficult to sit in for more than a short period of time.

On January 24, I traveled back to the store to pick up end tables and a coffee table. During that visit, I informed store staff about the issues with the loveseat. I was told they would open a ticket with Comfort Care and that someone would reach out to us. No one ever contacted us.

On February 2, I called the store and was told the manager had already left for the day but would call me the following day. That call never occurred.

On February 3 at approximately 11:35 a.m., I called the store again because I still had not been contacted. I was immediately placed on hold without a greeting. I hung up and called back. When I reached an associate, I explained again that the loveseat is uncomfortable, makes noise, and does not feel like the showroom model. I was told a Comfort Care technician would need to come inspect it. I asked if that was necessary even if the issue is comfort-related, and reiterated that I had already reported the issue in person on January 24.

I also mentioned that I had seen the return/exchange policy stating upholstered furniture can be exchanged within three days of receiving it. I was told that policy does not apply to made-to-order furniture and that the three-day window starts from the purchase date. I questioned how that could be reasonable when the furniture is not delivered for several weeks. I was told, “That’s the policy.”

After hanging up, I reviewed the policy online, which states:

“We will allow you to exchange residential upholstered furniture within 3 days of when you receive it…”

This directly contradicts what I was told.

I attempted to call the store back and received a message that all associates were busy. After waiting five minutes, I called again and was told that the three-day-from-receipt policy only applies to online orders. I requested a manager call me back.

I then contacted Comfort Care and explained the entire situation. The representative opened a general claim to create a paper trail and said she would escalate the issue to see if a return or exchange could be approved. She later returned and stated we were outside the three-day window. I explained that we are only outside that window because the store failed to document or act on my in-person complaint from January 24.

I was told the only documentation they had was my February 2 call. Because the store did not record my earlier visit, I am now being penalized.

I was informed that if a technician inspects the loveseat and finds nothing “wrong,” any exchange or return would be at the store’s discretion and could involve a restocking fee of up to 30%. This would amount to paying roughly 30% of $4,800 for a loveseat that has been used fewer than ten times for only a few minutes each time. This is unacceptable.

I was placed on hold for over ten minutes, checked on once, and ultimately told no one was available and that I could receive a callback within 1–2 days, despite already being promised multiple callbacks that never occurred.

Then today, I got a call from an escalation manager. She told me these couches are built for taller people. 5’10” and up. I’m 5’6”, my wife is shorter. Why was this not communicated to us during the buying process? I know why. I also brought up to her how it isn’t nearly as comfortable as the one in the show room. She said that one has been there for awhile and is broken in. I pushed back saying that I shouldn’t have to deal with back pain for a year or more just to break in a $5000 loveseat. She agreed.

I'm a commuter from Chester County. I get all around Center City, Old City, Rittenhouse. I've eaten my way through Chinatown many times. I get up to NoLibs/Fishtown, down to South Street enough. I've gotten to Baltimore Ave more than a few times. I've hit most of the South Philly Italian/cheesesteak places on my bucket list.

1qvxh9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qvxh9t/youth_by_thirty_cemetery/,Youth By Thirty: Cemetery,"“Have you read the report?” Trevor asked. 

I wasn’t used to the new face beside me. Younger than what I was used to. But I carried along as normal. I had a job to do.

“Yeah. Something up with the cemetery. Massive disturbance.”  I responded.

Trevor eyed me down. I was the guy people called when shit was weird. But he knew I was out of my depth with this one. Then again, I think everyone was, despite the few who pretended they knew what was going on.

The truck crawled up the gravel path, chewing pebbles as it arrived at the site. I foolishly expected it to just be us two to examine and report. But there were other guys there. All in their thirties.  Probably a dozen or so. All waiting for us. They had white tents propped up. Some were mobile labs. The rest stood over the grave plots.

These guys weren’t part of our division. I’m betting the government sent more agencies at this problem to piece together what the hell is happening. 

I pulled up the caution tape and stepped under, Trevor following behind. 

“So what’ve we got?” I gripped my unsipped cold coffee, desperately pretending that today was just a regular day on the job. A totem that represented normality. 

I scanned the site. Only a handful of graves were dug up. The undug ones were disturbed, as if a small eruption popped up from within the earth.

An agent in front of me pulled the mask off his face. He was covered in brown and grey filth. He’s been here for a while. 

“The coffins. They exploded.”

“All of them?” 

“All of them.”

“And you’ve ruled out casket failure?”

“This wasn’t caused by that.” He said it so confidently, as if we both knew what really caused this.

My face fell. He led me to one of the dug-up graves. 

I was used to trembling hands, but I was steady today. It was a welcome change to be able to do my work without needing to readjust and focus. I sat my coffee down, gloved up, and stepped into the pit.

The old wood on the small casket was splintered and broken like jagged thorns, oozing liquids and slush. It looked like the body exploded from within. I looked up and eyed the headstone. 

1956 – 1963

Shame. We shared the same birth year. He and I would have been the same age.
This body should be all bones. There shouldn’t be anything left to ooze out. I turned and asked the agent to get me the dates on all the other disturbed graves. He nodded and left. I could feel a bead of sweat drop from my nose. This wasn’t decades old bodily fluids. This looked fresh. 

I looked closer at the casket, and along with the jutted-out wood and metal, I noticed a curled limb poking out. An adult arm. I couldn’t believe it. I desperately began removing bits of casket. The pieces peeled away, soaked in goopy red bits, slimy tendrils snaking away like melted cheese pizza. 

The small, red-stained wooden box was warped and broken, just like the body inside. The corpse sat within a pool of chunky viscera, squeezed out from the fresh orifices popped from the smashed corpse. The arms were scrunched and curled, broken and gnarled in dozens of places. The right arm spiraled up against the chest in a hug-like position, while the left shot upwards, cut and bruised and snapped from smashing into the box’s lid.  The head was crushed and filled with crunched and cracked teeth, while fresh red pulpy chunks streamed from the eyes and ears. The knees were snapped off their ligaments and the legs were pushed up directly up into the pelvis, as if they were slammed by an intense force. The old, stained fabric clung to the body, shirt and pants stretched and torn. Much too small for this body.

This was a resting place for a child. A child that died decades ago. Why was there an adult man lying here, freshly dead? I crawled up out of the pit and snapped off my gloves. 

I pinched the bridge of my nose. I was worried about the implications of this. Especially if all the other graves were disturbed in similar ways. 

Trevor returned to me, this time with a clipboard in hand. He and I have been doing this job for nearly 20 years together. We were always in sync, no matter what dire circumstances we’ve found ourselves in. 

“That agent returned with the dates you asked for. It’s probably what you expected.”

I thanked him and scanned the dates. He was right. These were all children’s graves. And every single one was disturbed the same way. Each casket popped open by a freshly aged corpse, forced open by their new bodies, just to die all over again. 

It seemed that this condition didn’t just affect the living. It appeared to also resurrect the dead, forcing them to the age of thirty. I looked around at the hundreds of grave plots surrounding us. How many choked breaths by newly born thirty-year-olds now being held silent from the earth that sat above their heads. Freshly yanked from the afterlife to a hell six feet under. 

I felt my hands begin to tremor, a reminder of the old man that I used to be, just a few days ago.

Trevor looked at me, and I was afraid of the question he was going to ask me. Funny, the man I met when he was in his forties, now a decade younger. Normally I’d be able to see his concern with the lines that marked his face, but now they’re barely there, as if they were ironed out. 

“What should we do with all the other graves? The adult ones, I mean.”

I thought about it. I thought about what would happen to me if I chose wrong. There were so many new people, brought back from the dead. But just how many were there now, nationwide? Worldwide? How long would it take to exhume thousands of bodies? We have other dire issues to worry about at the moment. If every person on Earth is now thirty years old, can we even afford to add more to our population?

I took a sip of my cold coffee, the first one all day.

1qvxebr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1qvxebr/leaving_is_harder_than_expected/,Leaving is harder than expected?,"I asked him for a separation one morning last week (when I knew he’d be sober) - he said, “I knew you were going to say this” and left the house saying, bye love you…since, he has essentially not acknowledged WHY I’m gone. I’ve been staying with a friend for almost a week, and he texts me things like, I miss you, I love you so much, I hope to have a real conversation soon…but, he hasn’t actually shown any action to have said conversation…he’s offered to walk the dog together, but no explicit plan/mention of anything like, “hey I would like to talk can we meet for coffee”.

I don’t know what I’m expecting from that conversation, but I guess having him acknowledge the reality of why I’m gone would feel helpful.

The 3 nights prior to me leaving, he was drunk/falling asleep on the couch/getting in bed by 7:30pm…Is it livable for me? Yes. But does he sometimes yell, slam doors, and generally act unreasonable when drinking? Yes.

What I’m struggling with is, being out of the house and not seeing it every evening, I start to wonder if it’s really “that bad”, and that maybe it can get better. I don’t understand how I’m supposed to move forward during the separation if we can’t have a conversation where I can basically say, “I’ve felt really disconnected from you for a long time due to your drinking, I still love you, but I don’t want to do this any longer…”

(you can see past posts about his efforts to get sober recently)

I went back to the house to work on a day I knew he’d be at work, but he came home much earlier than expected and my reaction to seeing him was instant anxiety. How is the conversation going to go, etc. - no immediate desire to go hug him or anything. And while he didn’t raise his voice and he was sober, he was still trying to paint himself the victim - “I’ve been so gentle, I’ve given you space” etc. - and he acted like what I did was out of nowhere, a shock, and not understood…he said I hadn’t talked to him about this, but I have - and I also pointed out that I can’t most evenings because he’s drunk. I straight up said, “I’m done living with an alcoholic”, and it just falls of deaf ears.

Once I left the house, he continued to text that I’m showing him and the relationship no respect, but also continuing with the “love and miss you so much” texts….which for some reason still really pull at my heart strings. We’ve been together for 15 years, married for 6, so he is a huge part of my life and I’m having such a hard time imagining my life without him, but also, a hard time imagining feeling happy and fulfilled if I stay.",1,1770231471.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False
1qvxe06,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qvxe06/how_to_never_be_boring_in_conversation_the/,How to Never Be Boring in Conversation: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I studied this obsessively for like 2 years because I realised I was the person people would politely nod at, then immediately find an excuse to leave. not fun. spent hundreds of hours reading research, listening to charisma breakdowns, and honestly just watching how magnetic people operate.

Here's what actually works. tested on real humans, not just theory.

Stop performing, start connecting.

Most boring conversations happen because one person is basically waiting for their turn to talk. You're not listening, you're rehearsing your next line. People can feel this.

There's this concept from improv called ""yes, and"" that completely changed how I talk to people. Instead of hearing something and immediately pivoting to your own story, you actually build on what they said.

Like if someone says, ""I went hiking last weekend,"" the boring response is ""Oh, I hate hiking, but I love cycling."" You just killed the thread.

instead try ""oh nice, where'd you go? what made you pick that spot?"" then after they answer, THEN you can relate it to your thing. But you gotta let them finish their thought first.

Get comfortable with weird tangents.

The best conversations I've had went completely off the rails. started talking about coffee, ended up discussing childhood fears, then somehow landed on space travel.

Most people are scared of this. They think conversations need structure and topics. nah. follow the energy. If something sparks genuine curiosity in you, pull that thread even if it seems random.

There's a podcast called Conversations with People Who Hate Me by [Dylan Marron](https://www.dylanmarron.com/podcast/) where he literally talks to internet trolls, and the episodes work because he follows genuine curiosity instead of an agenda. The structure is chaotic, but it's never boring because you can feel his real interest.

Ask questions that make people think.

""What do you do?"" is the death of interesting conversation. Everyone has their rehearsed answer, and it goes nowhere.

Instead, try stuff like:

* ""What's been taking up most of your headspace lately?""
* ""What's something you believed a year ago that you don't anymore?""
* ""If you could restart your career knowing what you know now, would you?""

I got this from[ The Art of Gathering](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=the+art+of+gathering+priya+parker+hardcover&i=audible&crid=I3DGPD8R21OB&sprefix=THE+ART+OF+GA%2Caudible%2C366&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-expert-pd-ops-ranker_1_13) by Priya Parker. She's an expert in conflict resolution and designed peace talks, and she breaks down how the questions we ask literally shape the entire interaction. The book won't teach you conversation specifically, but it'll rewire how you think about human connection. honestly one of the most practical books I've read on this stuff.

Here's the thing, though, you can't just fire these questions randomly. It'll feel like an interview. You gotta earn the right to go deep by starting light and reading the room.

Share slightly vulnerable stuff.

Boring people only share their highlight reel. Interesting people share the messy middle.

not like trauma dumping on someone you just met. But like, if you messed something up or felt weird about something, share that. It gives people permission to be real, too. I used to think I had to have everything figured out to be interesting. Turns out the opposite is true. Confusion and uncertainty are way more relatable than certainty.

Actually develop opinions

You know what makes someone boring? Having zero takes on anything. ""I don't know, I don't really have an opinion on that"" in response to everything.

You don't need hot takes on global politics. But have SOME perspective on things you encounter. Why do you like that show? What frustrates you about your industry? What pattern have you noticed about people?

Read The Scout Mindset by Julia Galef. She's a podcaster and researcher who studies how people think, and the book is about how to form opinions without being a stubborn asshole about them. She breaks down the difference between the soldier mindset (defending your views) and the scout mindset (trying to see what's actually true).

Once you start thinking like a scout, you naturally have more interesting things to say because you're actually processing the world instead of just moving through it on autopilot.

Get genuinely curious about random shit.

The most interesting people I know have weird knowledge pockets. They know about fermentation, font design or why certain cities are built the way they are.

doesn't matter what it is. Just pick stuff that genuinely fascinates you and go deep. Then you have actual interesting things to pull from.

If you want to go deeper on communication psychology but don't have the energy to read a dozen books or listen to hours of podcasts, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) that pulls from books like the ones above, plus research papers and expert interviews on social psychology and conversation dynamics.

You can set a goal like ""become more charismatic in conversations as someone who overthinks"", and it'll generate personalised audio learning and a structured plan just for you. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It also has this virtual coach you can chat with about specific situations, like ""how do I recover when a conversation goes flat?"" The voice options are surprisingly good; there's even a sarcastic style that makes learning actually entertaining. Worth checking out if this stuff interests you.

also Curiosity Daily podcast. 10-minute episodes, each one covers 3 random topics. been listening for a year, and I can't tell you how many times something from there has come up naturally in conversation.

Match energy but add 10%

If someone's low energy and you come in like a golden retriever on espresso, it's jarring. If someone's hyped and you're monotone, you're a wet blanket.

But here's the key: match their energy, then bring it up slightly. This creates momentum without being exhausting.

Know when to let silence happen.

Ironically, trying too hard to never be boring makes you boring. because you're filling every gap with noise.

Sometimes the best move is to just sit in a pause. Let the other person think. Let yourself think. Not every second needs content.

Research on conversation dynamics shows that people who are comfortable with silence are perceived as more confident and trustworthy. It's in The Fine Art of Small Talk by Debra Fine, which sounds like a corporate workshop book but is actually really practical.

The real secret nobody talks about

You're probably not boring. You're probably just talking to people you have zero chemistry with and forcing it.

Not every conversation will be electric, and that's fine. Some people you just won't vibe with. The goal isn't to be interesting to everyone. It's to be genuinely yourself and find people who match that frequency.

If you're constantly bored in conversations, you might just be hanging around boring people. or people who aren't YOUR people.

I'm not saying give up on social skills. learn this stuff, practice it, get better at connecting. But also give yourself permission to be human and imperfect and occasionally awkward. That's actually what makes you NOT boring.",1,1770231454.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

Last time I made a post about changes in my UI/Extension was the release 1.0. I didn't change too much since then, but here is the changelog:

1.3: Audio support

1.2: Refined PWA support. Now this UI is installable as PWA, refined to fill more native, supports image files association, offline placeholder

1.1: Subgraphs support. Now it supports workflows with subgraphs inside, because the default comfy ui workflow started using them. Unfortunately nested subgraphs are not supported yet, but Flux Klein official workflow uses them, so I need to hurry. For now I just ungroped the nested subgraphs manually, but there must be a proper support

If you haven't heard about this project: it's an additional UI that can be installed as an extension, that shows your workflows in a compact non-node based layout.

My brother is postponing the forensic accountant. It's not because of me, I’m fine, he just says it can be tomorrow. I sort of want to just get it over, but this is fine too. So we are taking a break. My brother and his partner are taking my daughter to the petting zoo. It's cold, but her coat is warm. My sister and I are going to go swimming doing laps if no one is using the pool.



Before the lawyer left, he said don't worry about Dale getting off easy, the state will bring charges. I don't care about that. I wrote it down though.



10 pm. 

Swimming was good. No new cult created. I'm ok with the money being frozen. It will give me time to sort out the church. The Garden Gathering? Sacred Soil? I'll get a name that sounds welcoming. Once I'm ready to talk about it, I'll ask Julie what she thinks. I haven't talked to my siblings about the weave or any of this, they look at me like I scare them already.



Julie arranged for a tasting at a restaurant about an hour away. She hired a driver...ha! ""Hired a driver"". Your majesty. Ben and Julie had bought a princess dress for my daughter, and a black outfit for me. The shoes fit really well for both of us. how do you get shoes to fit without trying them on? Amazing.  We went to a fancy restaurant and had a tasting menu of tiny foods. Bites of meat, vegetables in froth and good tasting slime, fancy potatoes.

 Then about 15 tastes of cheesecake.  I liked the pomegranate one and the white chocolate. Truffle was disgusting which is weird. Chocolate truffles taste nice. 

Ava curtsied (how does she know about curtsies?) and called people, mostly the wait staff, ""your highness"" and ""your majesty"".  Everyone smiled, I think they enjoyed it. I was proud of her natural poise. It makes me think of  what the artist emailed me. She wished me ""many happy returns of the day so that I could have time to fully heal and heal others."" I emailed back and we talked. I told her my thoughts about carnivals and finding real. She said that sounded like a discerning way to view the world. Somewhere in there I said I wasn't as smart as my siblings or her, so I couldn't see things as clearly, and she said this was a quote:  ""In this world, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant. Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant. You may quote me"". She told me to find that movie and see if it meshed with my carnivals world view. What movie? She said it was from a movie. I googled it. Its an old black and white movie called Harvey. people thought he was crazy but still chose kindness. I told her I probably sound crazy for thinking of the weave as real, wanting to start a church and women's shelter. Thinking about carnivals. She said if we don't create our own language for the way the world works, we are forced into the existing language and all the ways of seeing things that the language holds. By creating our own language for it, we can see things differently, so she thought it was just fine.



She said that some of the most cruel actions of man in our history was couched in religious language and language of patriotism so to truly see things, creating your own vernacular can strip that bare and show you the pitfalls the language we are used to was was trying to hide. I think I understand what she means. What does vernacular mean?



Then she asked permission to use the carnivals analogy in her own vernacular because it fits so perfectly. I said of course, and she said thank you so much!



4am

I had to read my note to find out what happened yesterday.  Nothing stuck. I couldn't tell you without reading them what anyone told me. Now most of that is in my head but its like I read it in a book. The senator is creepy as fuck. Will that get on the news? Will he be fired?? He should be. Yuck. When you hear about that in the news the reporter says ""explicit materials"" and not names. Right? It won't be us in the news it will be him? And not Dale because then that's us in the news again. That's kind of why I was hoping Dale would just quietly go away. We are associated with his name. 



Dad is a connection to us too. In my church, and I'm serious, an important white collar criminal is almost admired. My dad won't suffer much in the church, respect wise, except for the ones who got money stolen. So, It won't be just strangers on the street who might have seen me poop. It will be church people who blame me for the fall of 'two good men'.  People in the carnival. Right now I could feel sorry for them. But if I'm not in robot mode and someone in the coffee shop calls me missy I'll be mad and upset.





I could move. There is almost no reason to stay. If I needed to come back though, this hotel is very nice for a short visit. I wonder if moving near my sister would feel like I'm squishing her life too much. I could move. I could. No matter how many times I wrote it is feels silly. It’s never been a thought. I was going to live in that two bedroom house with one bathroom forever because that's what I had. But I could move. I really could. 

  
3pm

This morning we met with the forensic accountant and after that lawyer met with us. This was all at his office. My brother met us there and a nice secretary watched my daughter.  I checked on her a lot and it gave me breaks. I'm just going to combine what the accountant and the lawyers said because the accountant would say one thing and the lawyer would tell me what it meant and I tried to write notes. 

Part of the reason why we didn't do this yesterday was because I was tired and my brother and sister thought it was enough for one day but another reason is because it would take a long time and they got more information yesterday afternoon when they went to arrest my dad and secure his house. Then my lawyer and the accountant went through some of that too they're not quite done but there's enough to get started with. 

It's about 3:00 in the afternoon right now and so we've been doing this all day and my robot is about out of battery. 



The case is bigger now because of the senator. I sort of thought that my dad had nothing to do with it but he did even though he doesn't know that he did. My dad has known the senator and been donating to him for over a decade. When I was pregnant my father introduced Dale to him. Later the senator invited my father and Dale to a missions trip in Thailand. Bangkok. It was not a missions trip it was a seminar on how to use media. My father gave a short address. My father said it was on media for spreading the gospel. But Dale said it was when he learned how to do streaming. And setting up crypto and getting subscribers. That it was a three day long intensive on setting up porn sites. 

About a week after the seminar my father got a $50,000 check from the senator thanking him for his cooperation. Dale also got $50,000 for startup money. 

A few months after that Dale started sending my dad $600 a week from a crypto wallet. My dad labeled it tithe. 

It appears that Dale was right, dad had not been paying him for years the money that went into the consulting files that were labeled Dale were cashed out by dad. Dale was actually paying my father. At first the website Dale had was recycling content from Thailand. Then he got another $50,000 payment from the senator the week my daughter was born. That was the week the cameras went up in the kitchen and living room for our security because we had a new daughter. That was also the week I visited the pastor and the pastor said that if I just submitted it would get better. 

About that time Dale stopped buying content from Thailand, and his subscriber list grew quite a lot. 

About 3 months ago my dad started to pay Dale about $6,000 a week. It appeared to be a countdown, as if paying a loan down in payments. 

In My Father's office after the rest of him they found several big boxes full of gift certificate cards for all sorts of stores and online gift certificate codes. They are still going through them and counting them but it looks like almost $300,000 worth of codes and cards. In a lock box he had a bunch of trump coins. And there is a statue that's been up in my dad's office for a few years now that it appears he bought in Thailand that was actually stolen from a local religious site that is worth millions. There's also a bunch of stock in e l o m i r which is the MLM. And a whole bunch of promises from the company to send free product. And it looks like my dad sent out discount codes to everyone on his mailing list and email list. The MLM is interesting because they already had hundreds of dealers ready who were taking pictures of themselves with Post-It note cut into strips on their tongues claiming that they had already tried the product and it was wonderful and had cured them from autism and cancer and arthritis and ADHD. The strips were never made. 

Something in this note made my sister cry. I'm not sure at what point she started crying I just looked over and there were tears down her face.



There is a lot more but we stopped the meeting for today when I saw my sister cry. Later my lawyer and I will go through my calendar and see if there is significant dates that line up with crypto transactions in Dales account. I sent him permission to look at our Google calendar. It has the days Dale was at work for about three years. Dales house is being searched. It's just been his girlfriend there since he was in jail, so they think that unless she knew what to destroy there will be information there.



5 pm

Last year I baked a cake for my daughter's birthday. As a joke, my husband sat her on it before we cut it. I cried, because it was a Bluey cake. The content that day got the highest it every was an hour or two before that and that scene is found a lot on dark web with me and the baby crying. I'm in the bathroom. I have a stomach bug I'm Ok, just... Dead batteries.

I just spent 10 days in an incredible, overlooked Italian region for less than €800. And honestly? My food was better. 🇮🇹

Seriously, most ""budget travel"" advice is unrealistic. It feels written by someone who never pays or expects you to survive on instant ramen. I believe in *real* budget travel: deep experiences without breaking the bank. After years of chasing ""hidden gems"" (and occasionally falling into tourist traps), I finally cracked the code in Abruzzo.

**The Abruzzo Advantage**

This region, nestled between the Apennine mountains and the Adriatic Sea, feels like stepping back in time. It’s authentic, stunning, and blessedly free of tourist hordes. Think medieval hilltop towns, national parks, and a coastline locals actually use.

**My 10-Day Abruzzo Cost Breakdown (Solo Traveler):**

*   **Flights:** €120 (Ryanair, direct from London to Pescara)
*   **Accommodation:** €350 (€35/night avg for Airbnb apartments in small towns like Sulmona and Santo Stefano di Sessanio. All had kitchens!)
*   **Food & Drink:** €200 (Groceries, local markets, and 1-2 meals out per day. The €8 ""arrosticini"" feast was legendary.)
*   **Transportation:** €80 (Mostly local buses, a couple of train tickets, one shared taxi for a mountain hike.)
*   **Activities/Misc:** €50 (Entrance to a castle, a wine tasting, souvenir olive oil.)

**Total: €800** (Excluding my flight to London, obviously.)

**What Actually Worked (Beyond the Obvious)**

*   **Embrace the *Agriturismo* model:** Stayed at an agriturismo outside L'Aquila for two nights – €40/night including breakfast and incredible, home-cooked dinner using their own farm produce. You *won't* find this level of authenticity or value in Tuscany.
*   **The €1 Coffee Rule:** Anywhere near a main piazza or ""famous"" site, coffee prices skyrocket. Learn to stand at the bar (like a local!) and you'll pay €1-1.20 for an espresso or cappuccino. Sit down? €3-5 easy. This applies everywhere in Italy.
*   **Food Markets are Your Best Friend:** Forget supermarkets. Find the local weekly market for fresh produce, cheese, cured meats, and bread. My picnic lunches overlooking mountain valleys were better than most restaurant meals.

**Real Talk: Here's What Nobody Mentions**

The public transport isn't always fantastic between smaller towns. If you're not renting a car (which I opted not to do for budget reasons), you'll need patience and flexibility. >*Some bus routes run only a couple of times a day, or not at all on Sundays.* Plan your movements carefully, or be prepared to splurge on the occasional taxi for longer distances if you want flexibility. I wished I'd known how challenging some Sunday connections would be.

**Would I Do It Again? Absolutely. What Would I Skip?**

I wouldn't bother with the ""fancy"" seafood restaurants right on the Pescara waterfront. Overpriced and underwhelming compared to the rustic mountain fare. Stick to the inland towns for true culinary delights.

**“Do women with breast implants commonly have mold toxicity?”**

After performing over 2,000 explant surgeries and PCR-testing more than 1,100 implant capsules, here’s what the data shows—without speculation.

# Is mold found on implants?

Almost never.

Out of 1,100+ PCR-tested capsules:

* Only **6 showed any fungal DNA**
* That’s **<1%**
* In those cases, there were clear environmental explanations (e.g., heavy soil or mud exposure)

There is **no evidence** that mold routinely grows on implants or inside capsules.

# Then why do many women with symptoms test positive for mold toxins?

Because mold exposure usually comes from **outside the body**, not the implant.

Most common sources:

* Indoor air (water damage, leaks, humidity)
* Food (grains, coffee, wine)
* Poor ventilation or filtration

# Why some people react more strongly

Genetics matter. Many symptomatic patients have reduced detox capacity (glutathione, methylation, antioxidant pathways). Same exposure ≠ same response.

# Does mold worsen symptoms?

Yes—but indirectly.

Mold increases overall inflammatory load. If detox pathways are already strained, symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, and GI issues can worsen over time.

# Summary

* Mold is **rarely found on implants**
* Environmental exposure is the real source
* Genetics determine susceptibility
* Mold can worsen symptoms but isn’t caused by implants

Disclaimer: I know, I know….not a fitness challenge.  But I have made massive changes and I’m just not seeing the results, at all.

Background: Used to be fit, then things went really far south last year. Started drinking, a lot. Heavy(double, triple) IPAs - at least 4 every night. Often more. 

Hit fast food almost daily, eating WAY too much junk. Broke foot running a marathon last summer, then again in the fall first time running again 😡 (literally waited 3 weeks after boot and tried to run 15 mins), so went from running marathons to sitting around all the time. Gained 40 lbs.

To be honest, I was expecting big changes, but it’s been minimal, maybe 5ish lbs down after 51 days.

My fitness is horrible. Mostly an outdoor walk, then an easy spin on the bike. BodyPump strength training class 4x/week (my job, can’t give up these classes weekly), where I try to lift a challenging weight.

On that measly workout routine, I’m exhausted 😩, which is ridiculous. Not making any fitness gains, exhausted and sore all the time.

Diet is gluten free (have a strong intolerance, which is why fast food was awful for me), no junk (fried foods, chips, sweets, candy, etc.

And obviously no booze.  

I struggle to hit my water daily, so I drink minimal other drinks - black coffee or a diet soda.

1qvwzd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1qvwzd7/stage_3_gerd_after_11_years_sharing_what_worked/,Stage 3 GERD after 11 years: Sharing what worked for me.,"Hii, this is my personal journey. Heads up — it’s a long post. This is also my first Reddit post, so please be kind, and let me know gently if I’ve shared anything inaccurate or insensitive.

I’m 29 (F), 54kg, 166cm living in the South East Asia region. I have been diagnosed with GERD, stage 3 (by the way, stage 4 is the last stage) according to both government and private hospitals after I did my endoscopy. They said my LES has weakened and there is no way of going back to normal.

I would like to share how I got better after 11 years of suffering from acid reflux. I won’t say I recovered fully, but something huge and tremendously positive happened to me because of this one-hour session I had with a nutritionist. I paid for the session.

Who am I with GERD -
I’m an extremely anxious person who has depended on classic 40mg omeprazole on and off for 8 solid years, Gaviscon, and liquid magnesium. I’ve been off coffee and citrus fruits for almost 4 years.

I had severe acid reflux and regurgitation anytime I ate any food whether healthy or unhealthy. My breath smelled sour due to acid regurgitating. I also had sore throat, itchy ears, and swollen ears because the acid reached up to my throat.

How I got GERD -
I used to skip my meals when I was 12 and developed severe gastritis at age 17. When I went to university, I had bulimia nervosa, where I forcefully puked the food I ate every day. This eventually weakened my LES opening. It became worse when my job required me to talk to people a lot (sales).

What I did for GERD -
At age 28, I did my second endoscopy screening and the doctor told me it was stage 3, with H. pylori detected. The doctor recommended:

eating small amounts of food 5–6 times per day.
taking omeprazole daily.

Eye-opening session with a nutritionist (or I would say damage control) -
The nutritionist helped me debunk some facts that were told by doctors and asked me follow some simple rules and eat natural food.

1. There is no high or “too much” acid in our stomach.
I had been on meds on and off, which led to low or suppressed stomach acid. My stomach acid became too weak and slow, so it took too long to digest food and ended up regurgitating because it didn’t produce enough acid to break food down faster.

The ideal stomach acid should break food faster, making it easier to digest and avoiding food fermentation, which can lead to acidic reflux reaching the throat, bloating, heaviness, and difficulty breathing.

2. How to do damage control

a. Start your day with warm water with a pinch of Celtic salt. Celtic salt has natural minerals, including magnesium, which help relax muscles. I had regurgitation even after taking omeprazole because my esophagus had adapted spasms. It helped me to reduce the spasm/reflux.

b. Avoid drinking water 30 minutes before and after meals to avoid bloating. Walk 5 to 10 mins after every meal. It helped me alottt.

c. Avoid dairy, beans, high-sugar fruits or vegetables, and processed food. Your stomach has to work much harder to break these foods down, which can lead to acid reflux.

d. Chew your freaking food slowly at least 20 times. You’re helping your stomach digest faster, so there’s less acid reflux and no food fermenting in the stomach.

e. LES can be repaired naturally. It takes time. Trust the process. Any muscle that can be damaged can be repaired. If it can’t be repaired, it can’t be damaged. Simple as that. Remember this. Your body is capable of mending things on its own.

f. Fasting. Fasting for 16–20 hours gives the body time to repair and heal. Your stomach has been working since day one. We need to give the factory some rest so it can heal. It gives ample time for the LES to recover. Do fasting as much as you can. I’m a rookie, so I do it once a week and slowly progress.

g. Ginger tea in the morning to improve digestion, and slowly introduce lemon water to increase natural stomach acid levels. Everything should be done before eating meals, preferably in the morning. Lemongrass boiled water helps eradicate harmful bacteria (H. pylori) in the stomach.

h. Eat three times a day, with gaps of 4–5 hours. This way, the stomach doesn’t need to produce acid every time you eat. Small, frequent meals are not recommended because they stress the stomach to produce acid repeatedly. Ideal is three meals — stick with this.

i. Trust the process and don’t overthink GERD. Overthinking and anxiety increase acid reflux.

It’s been almost 4 months. I followed this routine strictly for 1 solid months, and I could see my weight gaining in a healthy way. I have much less acid reflux now. Even if I have it, I just drink some hot water and walk for 10 minutes.

I saw big improvement because I trusted the process. I’m eating spicy food mindfully and drinking coffee confidently, because I now know which food should go first in my stomach, which tea I need to drink to stimulate my acid so it can help digestion, and when to stop eating at night.

I’ve been off all kinds of meds for 4 months and still sticking with simple rules. Hopefully things get better for for everyone here. Thank you!",11,1770230603.0,GERD,3,0.87,False

Is this healthy?,"I \[27 M\] have been limiting myself to just one meal a day for the last week and my weight is dropping drastically. I make the meals as nutritious as possible, with lots of protein, lots of vegetables and a moderate amount of carbs. I would estimate that each meal is 1,000 - 1,500 calories.

Also, I am a carpenter by trade and work 10-12 hour days, so my job is very physically intense. I spend most of my day doing heavy lifting and average 30,000 steps a day. I do not do any exercise outside of work and I always get at least 7 hours of sleep.

I am just wondering if this weight loss is normal? I feel like it’s dropping way too fast. My goal is to be around 170lbs, but am I doing this in a “healthy” way?

Edit: I feel like it’s worth mentioning that, apart from the one meal a day, I drink a hell of a lot of water and one coffee every day.",1,1770230570.0,fit,6,1.0,False

Vilka är de bästa sätten att framställa detta livselexir i fält?

**Coffee-sticks** \- Enkelt, lätt att ta med sig, går snabbt, allt som krävs är varmt vatten och smakar faktiskt helt ok i de flesta fall. Men ger ju samtidigt ingen smaksensation. **2,5/5**

**Kaffepanna** \- Många lovordar kaffepannan men den kräver en hel del omsorg och tid för att få till bra kaffe med och man får inte vara rädd för lite sump i koppen. Smaken kan bli riktigt bra men kan också bli en bränd smak om man inte är försiktig med värmen. Går att få med en stryktålig kaffepanna i packning eller fordon utan större bekymmer. Personligen har jag aldrig fått till något supergott kaffe med kaffepanna vilket givetvis handlar om bristande färdighet. Tidsåtgången kan vara för stor för att hinna med under fältmässiga förhållanden. **2/5**

**Kaffepress** \- Glasvarianter är såklart ömtåliga men metallvarianter är enkla att få med i både packning eller fordon. Fler smådelar än andra alternativ vilket kan vara en nackdel vid diskning. Går relativt snabbt, gör en stor volym och brukar bli gott, åtminstone om man gillar kokkaffe. **4/5**  
Följdfråga: någon som hittat en press-sats som passar till soldatköket? 

**Mockabryggare** \- En liten mockabryggare av italiensk stil kan med fördel medföras i packning eller fordon. Gör relativt snabbt ett svårslaget kaffe. Dessvärre blir volymen i de små bryggarna som gör bäst kaffe väldigt liten vilket kan göra det svårt att höja stridsvärdet hos flera kaffetörstande gruppmedlemmar. **Smak: 5/5 Volym 3/5**

We have been together for 13 years and have 3 kids together. I could understand if he actually had something legitimate to complain about. But when everyone in the house walks on egg shells to make sure that doesn't happen, I just don't know what to do. He's just mean. And after he finally wakes up all the way and thinks about how he acted, instead of apologizing, he walks around having a pitty party like ""why does no one like me?"" How can I teach my kids to treat people how they want to be treated when one of their examples acts like this?? He does take medication for depression but that's if he remembers to take it. Not to mention what we have to deal with if he doesn't.

They never spoke again, there was no mess.  Jane is going through a lot of change at the moment so has been feeling like reaching out to people from her past, as sort of an anchoring exercise, she remembers Nigel fondly so she reached out.   They chatted for 6 weeks, it was friendly with light flirtation.  The below is just the last 2 weeks of the 6 week exchange.  Jane did not know Nigel was in a relationship, he did not tell her.  Following this Jane found out that Nigel is actually engaged and the ‘personal travel 🎈’ is actually his wedding.  Jane hasn’t contacted him again since her last message and she has no interest in doing so.

[**AITAH for cutting off my family after my brother cheated on his wife and got his mistress pregnant?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jwteyl/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_family_after_my_brother/)

Oh boy this is going to be long. I will try my best to be concise. Also, sorry if formatting is weird I'm on mobile.

Okay, so some backstory, my brother (35M), is the favorite child. My mother (55F) always took more photos of him, always went to his games/plays/events/etc but never any others. If he got in trouble for anything, for example fighting at school and getting suspended, his punishments never lasted more than an hour. Meanwhile I, (31F) would be screamed at, cussed at, hit with shoes/belts/spoons if I so much as breathed the wrong way.

He has been married to his wife (35F) for 18 years. I love my SIL more than anything. She is sweet, funny, kind, and always the first to help when you're in need. Her biggest downside has always been that she isn't very money smart but my brother is and I thought they worked well together when it came to balancing each other. They bought a house, got a dog, and were trying to have a baby all while still saving a significant amount.

My brother says they started fighting a lot cause he wanted to save money and do IVF but my SIL really wanted a baby without all that. Admittedly, while they never struggled to get pregnant their babies were never healthy enough to survive after birth and their last 3 pregnancies ended with infant loss. Well, he got her pregnant again anyways and the baby is perfectly healthy. The day she told my brother she is pregnant he asked for a divorce and confessed he cheated with a co-worker (23F).

The biggest reason why I am so angry about this isn't because of how much love I have for my SIL but more so because my brother claims that he didn't know he even wanted a divorce until he cheated on his wife and realized he didn't feel guilty about it. But he also has confessed to our mother that he actively pursued a relationship with his co-worker. His co-worker is also very aware that he is married and has even met his wife. In fact, she regularly shops at the store that my sister-in-law works at and had made it a point to approach her at work prior to my SIL finding out about the affair.

Now on to what caused me cut off my family, I went to visit my SIL for the first time in a while. She was giving me a coffee table as her and my brother are selling their house (they are not divorcing, my brother will not file) and I decided I would also visit with her. Just to see how she was doing, check on her pregnancy and just all around, make sure that she is okay. Towards the end of my visit, my brother and my mother both started calling me excessively, texting me that I had to call them back right now and I hadn't even left her house yet. Once we got in the car and started driving away. My brother and mother started calling again. Several times back-to-back, and we finally answered And that's when they started getting angry at me.

Apparently my SIL told my brother she didn't want to go shopping after their 20 week appointment the next day and my brother thought it was my fault. My SIL does not know that my brother's mistress is pregnant and that they are only 4 weeks apart. He assumed I told her and when I responded that I had not told her anything he called me a liar and screamed and cursed at me. I ended up yelling back and told him to ""go f@!& himself"". My mother called immediately after and demanded to know what I told my SIL and when I told her the same thing I told my brother she too called me a liar and yelled at me.

I ended up blocking them both. My mother got so angry she couldn't get a hold of me she demanded I get my own insurance on my car (she bought it for me and is the only person on the title, it is still being financed by the dealership. I pay the car payment directly and send her money for the insurance), and that I add her back to Life360 so she knew where HER car was at all times. She also said my BF (30M) is not allowed to drive it (he doesn't unless I'm in the car with him). She texted my boyfriend all of that since she couldn't get to me. I ended up taking the car to her house and dropped it off with the keys and told her to do what she wants with it since she wanted to know where it was at all times.

She ended up texting my BF that we are both ""pieces of shit"" And to never contact her again. This was after I unblocked her long enough to text her that I would still make the payments but since she wanted to know where the car was she could just have it. I made a promise to pay it and I intended to keep that promise but now I don't think I should.

This whole time my mother has been hosting my brother's mistress at her house after my brother moved in with her and she keeps protecting him as much as she can. She even gaslights my SIL to make her think the divorce and affair are her fault. And she tries to blame me for my brother and SIL 'fighting'. I am so tempted to go nuclear.

With everything going on I could get my brother, mother, and the mistress fired from their jobs and could even get my parents evicted from their home since they live in a 55+ community and my brother is not on the lease. His staying there goes against their lease agreement and they could be evicted if the landlords/property management company finds out. I won't get them evicted or my mother fired but I wonder if my brother and his mistress should suffer consequences especially since my brother is the mistresses direct supervisor.

I also wonder if IATAH for cutting everyone except my SIL off after all of this. I tried to stay neutral for as long as I could because my SIL didn't want to cause fighting but I can't bring myself to stay quiet anymore. My mother and brother think I'm pretty much evil at this point because I won't protect my brother anymore. I also wonder if IWBTAH if I told my SIL about the mistress being pregnant and regularly staying with my brother at my mother's house. I know she would be angry enough to get a lawyer involved and I would support her 100%. So Reddit, what do you think? AITAH? Should I tell my SIL? And should I go nuclear?

Tldr: Brother cheated on wife and got mistress pregnant. Brother and mother started fighting with me and harassing me over calls and texts so I went nocontact and returned my car.

Edit: I realized from a comment I put they were married for 18 years, but they have been together 18 years. They started dating at 16 and 17 in high school. I'm sorry for not seeing that.

Update!

I will be meeting with my SIL tomorrow to tell her everything. I really feel I should do this in person. I would hate to have this kind of news delivered over call or text and I want her to know i will support whatever decision she makes 100%. I also have decided I will not be paying my mother another cent and cutting the cord cold turkey.

Thank you so much to those who gave such great advice. I will make sure my SIL is okay and safe before I do anything more. I will update after my meet up.

I don't really know how to update these things if i just edit the post or make a new post but... yeah. Anyways, long story short I did not tell my SIL. When my bf and I got to her house she wasn't there. We thought she was just at the market so we hung out for a bit. After about 30ish minutes my oldest brother (38M, not SIL husband) drove up in SILs car then my other brother drove up behind in his truck with my SIL in the truck. He was bringing her from the hospital.

When I spoke to her today she told me what happened. While out walking her dog friday evening, another dog came up and started attacking her dog. She has a 3 year old husky. While trying to break up the dogs and get away she hurt her stomach. She was worried about the baby and went to the hospital the next day since she was in a lot of pain. Good things is she only pulled a muscle and baby is healthy.

So when bf and I got there she had been given some meds and was loopy and tired. So we dropped off the pasta I made for her and let her rest. Also neither of my brother's wanted to talk to me or my bf and would barely look at us, so now I know my mom has my other brother turned against me. He's cut me off as well so I don't get to see my niece anymore.

But that's all for now. I'm gonna try to see her again when she's feeling better. I'm really worried about stressing her out too much when she's already not feeling well. I'll update again if anything happens.

# Update 2 - after 21 days (after 18 days from last post)

[**Update 2: AITAH for cutting off my family after my brother cheated on his wife and got his mistress pregnant**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kcl475/update_2_aitah_for_cutting_off_my_family_after_my/)

Oooooohhhhh boy! I know you guys have been bugging for an update but it's been absolutely insane. I'm at a total loss as to what to do now.

So, long story short, my SIL found out before I told her. I knew my idiot brother was out on dates with his mistress out in the open but I didn't realize where exactly.

This moron was out with his mistress in the SAME town my SILs sister lives in with her husband and kids. They saw this moron out with her and told my SIL. Of course I didn't know about any of this when it happened. I found out when I went over to visit her last week.

It went simply like this:

Me: I'm gonna be blunt and I need you to not freak out until I'm done. You can scream and cry and all that I will be here to listen but we gotta get your ducks in a row before you retaliate. [Mistress] is pregnant. From what I know you guys are like 4 weeks apart.

SIL: I know, my sister told me.

Guys, this woman went to my mother's house and saw the mistress's car there and knew everything from that point forward. I wondered why she was so quiet for a couple days after her hospital visit and it was because she got into a fight with my family and told them none of them would be seeing her baby. They are uninvited to the baby shower, no more doctors appointments with my brother, etc.

She was an absolute boss. And of course my brother blamed me. Even after my SIL told him it was her own family that saw them out and noticed the pregnant mistress. So I got harassed by my mother over email. I didn't bother responding except to tell her that if she contacted me again she would be hearing from a lawyer.

My SIL is going full scorched earth and I love it. I'm helping her find a good lawyer while researching laws in our state regarding custody and separation of assets and stuff. It's a lot to read and sometimes hard to understand but it's been enlightening to say the least.

We also reported my brother's conduct and my mother's harassment to their respective HR departments. So far it doesn't look like anything has been done. I couldn't get into contact with my mother's landlord either since they use a property management company so I sent the property managers an email. I haven't heard back from that so far.

Unfortunately for me though, my job was put in danger. I have been on stress leave because of this whole fiasco and I got a call from my admin HR. According to them, my mother issued a complaint about me. I had to forward the emails and screenshots of the texts I was getting to keep my job. So I will also be going to see a lawyer next week to send my family cease and desist notices.

And as much as I love my SIL I know that as long as I stay close to her my family will continue to come after me so my boyfriend and I have decided to leave state. I will continue to have contact with her and she has already promised to fly out and visit us regularly but she will be kept at arms length for the most part. I feel like I'm abandoning her but my mental health is taking a huge toll from all of the drama.

So far the plan is to take a roadtrip to our state of choice this September if we can afford it and do some pre-emptive apartment shopping with our dog. Then hopefully we will be moving next year in the summer. We're gonna sell all of our stuff and take only what we can fit in our car. We're also eloping this summer so that takes away a lot of stress too since I'm not wedding planning anymore. SIL will be our only witness.

Anyways, thanks for sticking around and I hope you guys have a good life ahead of you all. Thanks to so many of you for reaching out with advice and well wishes. I appreciate you all. This will most likely be my last update unless something crazy happens.

>>I did not move out of state yet. That's just the plan so far. I'm hoping to be out of here next year but it all depends on if my boyfriend and I are able to get the transfer. We plan on getting married this July for a number of reasons but the big one is the company we work for is very big on keeping families together. So if either one of us is able to transfer the other can follow immediately after. We work for a very good company thankfully.

My brother moved in with her and possibly so did his mistress. My understanding is she still lives with her parents at this time however. 4) I contacted her HR for her harassing me over text, email, and voicemail. I have dozens of each of her going nuts on me for no reason.

# Update 3 - after 5 months (after 4.5 months from last post)

^(September 12, 2025)

[**Update 3 in comments**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kcl475/comment/ndycke8/)

I didnt think i would ever update again, but i saw your comment and thought I'd say something. It's currently 12:38 AM, my Fiancee is knocked out next to me in our new apartment in Colorado.

I got an opportunity i couldn't pass up and he and I decided to take the chance. We've been here a month and a half now and everything is great. My Sister-in-law had her baby girl a week after we left. She had to be induced early because of all the stress she was under from the cheating and separation. But baby girl is healthy and thriving. She is the absolutely cutest thing on this planet. I'm building a care package to mail to them at the moment.

As for my brother, he still hasn't filed for divorce, lives with his mistress who will be giving birth very soon herself, and he has told my sister-in-law that he doesn't care about his mistress and has no attachment to ""her child"". Yeah, he's a real winner (insert aggressive eye roll here). My mom should have swallowed that time.

And I have been absolutely zero contact with my mother for 2 months now. I blocked her on everything. I had to go so far as to block her from my email too. My sister-in-law cut her off when she found out my mother had let my brother's mistress move in with her. So she lost access to her granddaughter for my brother's side chick.

No one knows where I live, they know what state but have no idea where I am at exactly which is great. Everything is still so surreal but im loving every second of this new adventure. My Fiance is also very happy and loving his new job too. We plan on getting a cat soon since mine passed away last February. I'm hoping for more brighter days ahead.

Thank you all for checking in on us, we appreciate it. Well wishes to all of you ❤️

The[ **secondary bacteria that causes ulcers in the stomach**](https://healwithdrshivani.com/) is also *H. pylori*.

Plain rice or porridge

1 am looking for chill & genuine sellers to trade with regularly. I'm not a massive whale, just want consistent, clean deals without the stress.

The Plan:

• Meet at a Starbucks or a mall food court (I'm usually around Bandra/Andheri, but flexible).

• We can do a small test trade first to build trust.

• Cash or F2F transfer, whatever works best.

If you're a real person and want to sort out a safe, regular arrangement, hit me up! No shady stuff, just clean business.

1qvwk49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qvwk49/the_psychology_of_focus_how_to_stay_sharp_in_a/,The Psychology of Focus How to Stay Sharp in a World Built to Distract You,"I've spent the last year reading everything I could find about attention, focus, and why our brains feel like they're constantly shorting out. Books, research papers, neuroscience podcasts, interviews with people who've studied this stuff for decades. And here's what nobody wants to admit: it's not just you being lazy or undisciplined. The entire infrastructure of modern life is literally engineered to fragment your attention into dust. Social media algorithms, infinite scroll, push notifications, the way offices are designed, even how we're taught to work. It's all optimized for distraction, not depth.

But the wild part? Once you understand how attention actually works at a neurological level, and what's hijacking it, you can reverse engineer your way back to focus. Not some superhuman monk level concentration, just the ability to think clearly for more than 90 seconds at a time. Here's what actually works.

**1. Your attention span isn't dead, it's just been stolen in tiny increments**

Cal Newport (the guy who wrote ""Deep Work"" and has been studying knowledge work for 15+ years at Georgetown) breaks it down like this: every time you context switch, even just glancing at your phone, your brain needs about 20 minutes to fully re-engage with complex work. TWENTY MINUTES. But most people check their phones every 12 minutes on average. Do the math. You're never actually focused, you're just constantly ramping up and getting interrupted before you hit your stride.

The fix isn't willpower, it's architecture. Block scheduling works because it removes the decision fatigue. I started using 90 minute blocks (based on ultradian rhythms, which is how your brain naturally cycles through high and low alertness) with my phone in a different room. Not on silent. Not face down. In a different room. Sounds extreme but after like three days it stopped feeling weird and my ability to actually finish thoughts came back.

**2. Boredom is a feature not a bug**

This one messed me up because it goes against everything we're taught.[ Dr. Sandi Mann](https://www.lancashire.ac.uk/academics/sandi-mann) (psychologist who literally wrote the book on boredom, teaches at University of Central Lancashire) found that boredom is essential for creativity and deep thinking. Your brain needs unstimulated time to process, connect ideas, consolidate memories. But we've criminalized boredom. Standing in line? Scroll. Waiting for coffee? Scroll. That 30 seconds before the zoom call starts? Believe it or not, also scroll.

Try this: do nothing for 10 minutes a day. Not meditation, not journaling, literally just sit there and be bored. Let your mind wander. It feels absolutely excruciating at first, like your skin is crawling, but that discomfort is actually your brain relearning how to generate its own stimulation instead of outsourcing it to an algorithm.

**3. Attention residue is killing your output**

Sophie Leroy (business professor who researches this at University of Washington) discovered this concept called attention residue. Basically, when you switch tasks, part of your attention stays stuck on the previous thing. The more intense the previous task, the more residue. So when you're trying to write a report but you just got done arguing in a slack channel about where to order lunch, your brain is still partially in argument mode.

Her research shows the solution is building transition rituals. Sounds woo woo but it works. Mine is stupid simple: after finishing one task, I write down three bullet points about what I accomplished, then physically stand up and walk around my apartment for 2 minutes before starting the next thing. That's it. But it signals to your brain ""we're done with that, moving on"" instead of just lurching from thing to thing like a zombie.

**4. Your environment is either building focus or destroying it**

I picked up ""Hyperfocus"" by Chris Bailey (spent years researching productivity, synthesized like hundreds of studies into one book) and the main takeaway was this: your environment isn't neutral. It's either actively supporting deep work or actively sabotaging it. Most people try to focus in environments that are essentially designed for distraction, then blame themselves when it doesn't work.

Audit your space. Is your phone visible? That alone reduces your cognitive capacity even if it's off. Multiple monitors? Great for some tasks, terrible for focus intensive work because peripheral movement is distracting. Open office? You're cooked, but noise cancelling headphones plus brown noise (not white noise, brown noise is better for blocking speech) helps a lot.

The app ""Freedom"" is genuinely worth paying for. It blocks websites and apps across all your devices at scheduled times. You can't cheat it without going through like five menus, which creates enough friction that you usually just don't. ""Forest"" gamifies staying off your phone by growing a virtual tree that dies if you leave the app. Sounds childish but the visual feedback loop actually works because your brain likes not killing the tree.

If you want something that goes deeper on these focus and productivity topics but in a way that actually sticks, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) that's been useful. It's an AI-powered personalized learning platform built by a team from Columbia and Google that pulls from psychology research, productivity books, and expert interviews to create custom audio learning plans. You can set a specific goal like ""improve my focus as someone with ADHD"" or ""build better work habits as a chronic procrastinator"" and it generates a structured learning plan with podcasts tailored to your situation. You can adjust the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. It connects a lot of the concepts from books like Deep Work, Hyperfocus, and others into one personalized system that learns what works for you.

**5. Sleep is non negotiable and you're probably doing it wrong**

Matthew Walker wrote ""Why We Sleep"" after running UC Berkeley's sleep lab for years, and it's legitimately one of the most important books I've read. The data is clear: anything less than 7 hours, your attention, memory, decision making, all of it drops off a cliff. But it's not just duration, it's consistency. Your circadian rhythm needs regularity to function properly.

Same bedtime every night, even weekends. Room as dark as possible (blackout curtains changed my life). Temperature around 65-68 degrees. No screens an hour before bed because blue light genuinely does mess with melatonin. If you can't do an hour, at least use blue light filters. The app ""Twilight"" is solid for this.

Also, caffeine has a half life of 6 hours. If you drink coffee at 4pm, a quarter of it is still in your system at 10pm. I moved my last coffee to 2pm and the difference in sleep quality was immediate.

**6. Multitasking is a lie your brain tells you**

Neuroscience is unambiguous on this: multitasking doesn't exist. What you're actually doing is task switching, and every switch has a cognitive cost. Dr. Earl Miller (neuroscientist at MIT who studies attention) found that when you ""multitask,"" you're using glucose and energy at a higher rate, producing cortisol and adrenaline, and significantly increasing errors.

You feel busy and productive but you're actually just frantic and inefficient. The solution is monotasking, which sounds obvious but is harder than it seems because we're addicted to that task switching high. Pick one thing. Do that thing until it's done or your timer goes off. Then pick the next thing.

For me, the ""Pomodoro Technique"" (25 min work, 5 min break) felt too short for deep work, so I do 50/10 instead. The app ""Focus Keeper"" tracks it automatically. During breaks I do something physical, not more screen time. Push ups, walk around, make tea, whatever gets blood moving.

**7. Information diet matters as much as food diet**

We talk about eating healthy but consume information like it's an all you can eat buffet of garbage. Ryan Holiday (writes about stoicism and media, former director of marketing at American Apparel) points out that most news is designed to make you angry and anxious because that drives engagement. Same with social media. You're not informed, you're just upset and distracted.

I cut my news intake to 15 minutes a day, just headlines from quality sources. Deleted social media apps from my phone (you can still access via browser when needed, but the friction helps). Replaced doomscrolling time with reading actual books. ""The Organized Mind"" by Daniel Levitin (neuroscientist who studies information overload) breaks down why this matters, your brain can only process so much before it starts making worse decisions.

For book reading, I use ""Libby"" which connects to your library card and lets you borrow ebooks and audiobooks for free. Game changer because I'm broke but still want to consume quality information.

**8. Your dopamine system is fried and you need to reset it**

Dr. Anna Lembke runs Stanford's addiction clinic and wrote ""Dopamine Nation"" about how we're all basically addicted to cheap dopamine hits. Social media, junk food, porn, shopping, whatever. Your brain builds tolerance just like with drugs, so you need more stimulus to feel normal. This is why you can't focus, you've raised your baseline so high that normal tasks feel impossibly boring.

The reset is a dopamine fast, which sounds like Silicon Valley nonsense but the science is legit. Pick your biggest dopamine source and cut it completely for 30 days. For most people that's social media or their phone. Replace it with low dopamine activities like walking, reading, cooking, whatever doesn't involve screens or sugar.

It absolutely sucks for the first week. You'll be irritable and bored and convinced you're missing out on everything. But around day 10 normal things start feeling interesting again. Books hold your attention. Conversations feel engaging. Work doesn't feel like pulling teeth.

**9. Movement unlocks mental clarity**

[John Ratey](https://www.health.harvard.edu/authors/john-j-ratey-md) (Harvard psychiatry professor) wrote ""Spark"" about how exercise is basically miracle grow for your brain. It increases BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) which helps neurons grow and survive. It improves executive function, attention, processing speed, all of it. The research shows even just 20 minutes of moderate cardio significantly improves focus for hours afterward.

I started doing a 20 minute walk every morning before work. Not a workout, just walking. It's become non negotiable because the difference in mental clarity is that noticeable. On days when I skip it I'm foggy and scattered. On days I do it everything clicks.

The app ""Couch to 5K"" is great if you want to start running but don't know how. ""Strava"" is good for tracking walks and runs. Or just put on shoes and leave your house for 20 minutes. Don't overthink it.

**10. Protect your peak hours like they're sacred**

Daniel Pink wrote ""When"" about chronobiology and timing, basically we all have natural peaks and troughs in cognitive ability throughout the day. For most people (not everyone), peak alertness and focus is 2-4 hours after waking. That's your window for deep work, complex problem solving, creative thinking.

Most people waste those hours on email, meetings, administrative BS. Insane. Protect those hours. Schedule deep work first thing. Don't check email until after. Don't take meetings during peak time unless absolutely necessary. Use afternoons for shallow work, admin tasks, meetings, stuff that doesn't require peak cognitive function.

Track your energy levels for a week using the app ""Rize"" or just a notebook. Notice when you feel sharpest versus most drained. Then design your schedule around your biology instead of fighting it.

Look, none of this is magic. It's just understanding how attention actually works and then removing the things that break it. The world is legitimately designed to keep you distracted and numb because that's more profitable than you being focused and clear headed. But you can opt out. It takes some effort upfront but the ROI is getting your brain back.

You're not broken. The system is. But you can build a different system for yourself that actually works.",1,1770229719.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False

I spent most of that time in my shell. I never participated in anything because I had stage fright and social anxiety, and I also come from a place where extracurricular activities weren’t really supported. Because of that, I never explored much beyond what was compulsory.
People often assume that if you weren’t into activities, you must have been good at studies. That wasn’t true for me. I was an average student in subjects like history, maths, literature, and languages, and I barely passed science-related subjects. I didn’t really enjoy studying back then either. The one thing I genuinely liked was sketching, and I was above average at it, but it never went anywhere.
When I had to start earning, I took tuition for a student from 4th to 7th standard. Later, I did some basic social media work, like posting Instagram stories for a local coffee shop. It was something, but it didn’t feel like I was building a real skill.
Right now, I’m in a non-attending university doing a Bachelor’s in Commerce, and alongside that, I’m pursuing a professional course to become a compliance officer. For the first time, I actually want to push myself and be an overachiever. I want to do well, get first rank, earn awards and certificates, and prove to myself that I can be consistent and disciplined.
What bothers me the most is looking back and feeling like my school life is almost blank. I didn’t have many friends, I didn’t participate in much, and I didn’t build memories or confidence. It feels like time just passed without leaving anything behind.
I know change isn’t easy and it takes a lot of effort, but I don’t want to keep living like I’m just drifting. I want to look back someday and clearly see where I spent my time and what I worked for. Even if I’m starting late, I want to start seriously now.",1,1770229676.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
