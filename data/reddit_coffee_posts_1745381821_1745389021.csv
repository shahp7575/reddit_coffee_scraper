I thought that I would definitely love the brikka but I kinda regret that I didn’t buy just another regular Moka.
I drink only medium-dark roasts and with my old mokapot it always tasted pretty good and a good amount of coffee would come out. Now after a few days with the brikka all the recipes I’ve tried includes 100-120 ml of water and 20-25 grams of coffee so the outcome is pretty disappointing in terms of amount and taste (comparing to regular moka).

My grind size is just a little finer than what I used to grind for the moka and I’m using cold water as recommended.

I just ended a 5-year relationship with someone I once believed was my soulmate, my best friend, and my future. But even saying that out loud now shows me how much I was projecting my hopes onto someone who couldn’t meet me emotionally.

I’m not sharing this to shame him—but to highlight how the early signs we ignore often become the very reasons it ends. If someone doesn’t show up for you when it really matters, you have every right to walk away. So here’s what I overlooked:

- A few months in, I fell and hit my head. Mild concussion. I called him. He said he couldn’t come—he had to work. I begged, and he came. Thirty minutes later, he asked if he could go home.

- He would openly check out other women right in front of me—on the beach, on the street. When I said it hurt, he told me it’s ""just biology""—men are hunters. It took years of confrontation and me almost leaving for that to change. He once admitted he was addicted to porn, which probably fed into this.

- Every time we had a difficult conversation, he’d leave. Just disappeared. No message, no “we’ll talk later,” just silence.

- He’d split the bill for everything—including cups of coffee or expenses when visiting his family. Maybe this is cultural (I’m from Asia, he’s Caucasian), but to me, it felt transactional and cold.

- on my birthdays, I’d wake up to nothing. No gift. No wish. When I brought it up, he’d say birthdays don’t matter to him, so why should they matter to me? Same thing with Valentine’s Day.

- Now that I’ve had two weeks of distance, I can finally admit: I couldn’t count on him. Not for care. Not for love. Not even for basic emotional support.

But I also want to be real about my part in this. I was angry, anxious, and often demanding. I’d shut down, give ultimatums, nag, withdraw, push for love when he was pulling away. I wonder now if anxious-avoidant couples ever really make it long term.

I’m not writing this with blame in mind. I know it’s complex. Contexts matter. But I’m writing this for anyone who’s still trying to hold something together that’s breaking you. For anyone who’s giving too much, receiving too little, and calling it love.

Please know: it’s okay to let go. It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to grow from it. You’re not broken—you’re learning. I hope you find peace, forgive yourself, and move toward love that feels safe, reciprocal, and true.

Sending love to anyone who needs it right now.

Context: Im 44M and my partner is 28F. 3 years na kami together. Okay naman relationship namin before sobrang sweet, maalaga, understanding, talagang mabait sya at masayahin bonus nalang yung looks nya.

Aminado naman ako na nakagawa ako ng kasalanan sa kanya during our 2nd year dahil nag reach out ang ex ko for 11 years. Hindi ko inamin agad sa current gf ko. Nag kita kami ni ex sa coffee shop at malinis ang konsensya ko na walang nangyari samin ni ex. Ang naging pag uusap namin ay kesyo gusto nya daw ayusin at ibalik yung relasyon namin. For context bigla nya lang ako iniwan sa ere for 2 years at ang reason is family problem daw. Ang sabi nya hihintayin nya daw ako for 3 years pag hindi ako nag paramdam she will move forward na with her life and will look for a lifetime partner. She offered na pag kinasal kami mag stay kami sa condo nya at asikasuhin nalang mga business nya. Si ex ay successful na sa life habang gf ko ayaw pa mag pakasal dahil breadwinner sya at may pinapaaral pang bunso na kapatid.

Tinago ko yung closure namin sa current gf ko pero nakita nya sa convo namin ng bestfriend ko dahil di ko na delete. Ang nabasa lang dun ni gf sa convo namin ni friend ay nag reach out si ex at gusto makipag balikan. That time pinag sasampal ako ng GF ko kaya sa sobrang takot ko na din na makipag hiwalay sya that time hindi ko sinabi na nag kita kami ni ex. 

Pero hanggang ngayon naging malala ang ugali ni GF, lagi na syang paranoid pag may mag chachat sakin or kapag aalis ako. Para syang baliw na akala nya may gagawin ako masama. 

After 2 years ganon parin ugali ni GF hindi na sweet at pag may travel kami dati lagi syang naka ngiti ngayon lagi na naka simangot at minsan bigla nalang iiyak.

  
Napapagod na ako sa sitwasyon namin. May chance pa ba bumalik yung ugali ni gf dati?

Comfort Zone is Our Kryptonite.

**The most devastating and detrimental thing a man can do in his life is STAY IN HIS COMFORT ZONE.**

Men back in the old days, thousands of years ago, would have **died**,

if they started Slacking off,

if they stopped training.

Back in the day, **Society's survival was dependent on Men's ability to stay and live in the uncomfortable.**

It was dependent upon Men's ability to keep his purpose and his mission number 1.

His Family's survival was dependent on his ability to press onwards and take risks.

Men used to go to the battlefield away from their Families, AWAY FROM HIS COMFORT.

**A woman's survival was dependent upon her man not getting comfortable. To be equipped with the tools to handle the dangers of life. To stay away from the easy life.**

Its only in the last 70 years or so that Man started thinking its fine to get comfortable.

Then we look at our relationships, our family and we wonder why don't get respect from society, our women, our families.

**WOMEN ONLY RESPECT STRENGTH. THEY WERE DESIGNED TO BE REPELLED BY WEAKNESS.**

**Associating with a weak man would have cost them their lives**

For tens of thousands of years, Women only respected the men who were go getters and worthy of being respected. It is HARD CODED in their own survival instinct. They needed an aggressive man who eagerly went beyond the fog and discovered new land, killed dangerous animals, killed other men.

It is not a coincidence she wants the asshole and not you. The asshole triggers fear in them. Fear makes them >!wet and horny.!<

Women respect Men that command Fear from others.

Its no secret that Modern Women are into criminals too.

Ted Bundy and other serial rapists/murderers received thousands of love letters from females around the world. Despite the heinous nature of their crimes. [Male criminals are often in sexual relationships with female guards. ](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/18-female-guards-single-jail-29431833)

**LET THIS SINK IN:** >!***Convicts in prison are fucking the police (literally) and half of modern men can’t even get a text back.***!<

Women like dangerous men because if he's dangerous in general, imagine what he would do or *be willing to do* for the person he was emotionally attached to...i.e. if the person he was attached to, was under threat.

It answers women's need to feel ""protected"" evolutionarily.

The fact that criminals have the capacity to kill or be killed overrides women's intelligence and makes them weak at the knees. **This is the hard truth.** There is a term for this behavior called Hybristophilia.

**They are not just attracted to these criminals, they fantasize about them.**

During trials of Dahmer and Ted Bundy, women flooded the court to get a ""glimpse"" of them. Earlier it was Wade Wilson, the man who would manipulate and sleep with women, and brutally murdered two other women. *He also received fan mail and money in jail, petitions with an absurd amount of signatures asking for his release.*

Now, these criminals might be retainers too but only SR won't get you there. You need to transmute sexual energy and create an edge. Build the capacity to be dangerous. Obviously, do not become a criminal. Not all women are into criminals, you don't want to be with women who are either.

A little Game might get you short term relationships but good luck keeping her without developing anything of substance. Evolutionarily, if a woman respected a weak man who ""gamed"" her into having his children: it would mean her life and her offspring's lives.

All of you have a good shoulder above your heads. You are observant. Despite the lack of mainstream evidence you can tell that semen has value. You have enough awareness to notice a drop in Quality of life without your essence. You are not fooled by the matrix.

You need to start self imposing carefully planned discomfort in your life. Make planned, consistent discomfort a lifestyle.

**Most of you think that you need a relationship** to  fix that hole that missing puzzle in your life.

**YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP, YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION FOR YOUR LONELINESS. A bandage for your wound. You should heal the wound first.**

**Loneliness is cured in solitude, in discomfort, in sexual transmutation.**

**All the advancements in society that you see around you, the device you are reading this post on was Once an idea waiting to be transmuted into reality. Without sexual transmutation you wouldn't have ANYTHING.**

**Modern society and infrastructure is the product of sexual transmutation. Releasers are not capable of consistency.**

**The end game of Semen Retention is not to attract someone and be in a relationship with them, the end game of Semen Retention is to create a Mindset that consciously puts itself out there, takes the risk. A mindset that is not faltered by mere emotions.**

**The end game of Retention is to Develop and Create such a solid foundation of good habits, that even without retaining one is able to sustain these habits.**

**Sustain the skills and habits : Not as long as one is retaining, not for 90 days, not for 1 year, BUT FOR LIFE.**

That cannot happen without sexual transmutation. Sitting around watching netflix, smoking weed, drinking, vaping, playing games while retaining is not enough. You know you're not supposed to be doing this shit.

Make small tweaks: do something else instead. You don't have to become Goggins and go run ultramarathon and break all your bones in your feet.

This kryptonite is drowning us guys

This Kryptonite is the cause of loneliness, it is the cause of many mental illnesses, it is the cause of social anxiety, heart diseases, it is the cause of divorces, break ups, lack of social life, Low Testosterone, obesity and by extension cancer and other obesity related diseases

it is why you are not physically fit, it is why you are not chasing excellence.

It sneaks up on you, me and everyone in the world. The comfort zone is the most dangerous place to be in 2025. **It is the ultimate deception of the Matrix.**

**You need to push yourself out of your zone consistently and surgically. Every man who diligently, responsibly, consistently, intentionally puts themselves in discomfort consistently gets rewarded tenfold.**

**This is the secret of the universe. Be uncomfortable, plan your discomfort, expose yourself to it slowly but everyday, don't push yourself into the abyss all at once. Be surgical about it. Look at athletes, look at everyone on the highest social echelon. Everyone went through either self-imposed discomfort or the universe imposed it on them.**

**Grab a hammer and smash your comfort zone.** No more comfort food, No ordering food, no more comfort games, no more comfort friends, no more comfort weed. No more gaming in moderation. Go out to play instead. Some things need to be quit cold turkey.

**Ever wonder why Gaming in moderation means playing 2 hours every day but Going to the gym for 2 hours everyday is ""overtraining"" even though you can Actively rest once a week in the gym.**

**It is a matrix PsyOp. You won't injure yourself training 7 days a week. Our ancestors used to cut trees 10-12 hours a day for 365 days a year. No breaks. The family meal used to be dependent upon it.**

Look at construction workers, farmers, military personnel, mountaineer guides, ballet dancers, professional athletes do it everyday and more intensely than you.

We have been brainwashed. Again Be surgical about your training. Be mindful of your body. Meditate. You will never get injured if you lift for longevity not for your ego.

There are plenty of gen z kids who self diagnose themselves as ""Autist"" and ""socially anxious"" No you are not. These are symptoms. Symptoms of spending too much fucking time in the comfort zone.

Half of the young men I know don't have a driver's license? Girls are more daring than guys these days.

Get your masculinity back. Build that ability to sit in the fire. All the well paying jobs test exactly that.

Neurosurgeon? Ability to operate under immense pressure

Lawyer? Ability to argue under immense pressure

CEO? Ability to use higher order thinking skills and making decisions under immense pressure.

Michael Jordan? Ability to score a 3 pointer half way from the court with 5 seconds left on the clock

Firemen? You get the point.

Having a sexual Urge? Control yourself under pressure.

Feeling hungry want to order food? No you're cooking healthy food for yourself.

Want to have coffee or soda? Nope you are having juice or fruits instead.

You don't need to have drastic overhauls guys.

MAKE SMALL TWEAKS for massive success. These small tweaks will put you in that mindset of pushing yourself everyday. unlock the hidden ancestral masculinity. THAT IS THE GOAL. TO BUILD A HABIT OF PUTTING YOURSELF IN CONSISTENT, CALCULATED, PLANNED DISCOMFORT that benefits you in the long run. That is transmutation of sexual energy too.

Men were never created to be comfortable. We are creatures of utility. If we are not useful and stay in our comfort zone, we become depressed.

No we are not autistic, no we are not social awkward, no we are not introverts, no we are not lazy, no we are not procrastinators. We are just stuck in the frame of the world. The comfort zone. The matrix is plugged in our brains. Just like Neo plugged into the Matrix using a **cranial jacking port**—a cybernetic implant located at the base of his skull. We are plugged in using our phones. Its very hard to unplug once the reels get going isn't it? Its like that stun grenade from Call of Duty, right? BECAUSE IT IS DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU PROCRASTINATE. SOMEONE SPENT BILLIONS TO PREVENT YOU FROM TRANSMUTING YOUR ENERGY.

The matrix holds you against your will. Your control has been relinquished.

WE ALL OF US ARE HERE AT r/Semenretention TO SAY NO THE WOMAN IN THE RED DRESS. TAKE OUR ATTENTION BACK.

We need to conquer our fears. Your fears are thin air right now. Social anxiety is nothing. Go talk to people, right now just talking to people is a risk in your mind. The more risks you take the more testosterone increases.

Masculinity = Risk taking responsibly and mindfully. Transmute that energy.

Even Relationships require work, it won't cure shit. EVEN HAVING SEX WITH A WOMAN IS WORK. Women now have previous partners and will  judge your performance.

Women will respect you based on your sexual ability and sexual skill. There is no way around it. You have to fall in love with taking risks, being uncomfortable. You are getting fat and comfortable.

This is the definition of a simp, a person who prioritizes a woman's sex over his goals in life. A man who keeps women as his primary focus.

We all know about Twitch Moderators who got pissy and got called simps. They were the men who put all their waking hours, money and attention to serve female streamers while getting nothing in return only hopes of a relationship.

You either choose a comfortable life or choose to have a Family with a woman who respects you. You cannot have both.

""You can either please a woman or keep her"". Only few will understand this quote.

Be a Man and set an example. Build an ironclad work ethic that your family gets scared looking at you building your life.

Hard work is always respected. Always. I have caught 11/10 women in my gym looking at me admiring my work ethic.

Women cannot help but fantasize about men who thrive in discomfort. For men who have the [Courage to be Disliked.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1jgfmia/the_most_underrated_benefit_of_sr/)

Be uncommon amongst common people.

Its a free Sexual market nowadays: If you become complacent, your woman will find a better man. The only way to keep a woman is to Be the best version of yourself.

1k5rydh,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1k5rydh/why_im_sugarfree/,Why I’m Sugar-Free….,"A small true story based on the experience in a Lala corporate. Take it lightly. 

I once worked in a typical Lala company — large, old-school, and run by an extended family of 12 to 15 promoters. I reported to one of them: 55 years old, average height, fully bald, with big eyes and a voice that didn’t need a mic. A second-generation businessman, he had nothing much to do. The company practically ran itself — he was just there to make sure no one got too comfortable.

Two weeks into the job, I had my first official meeting with him and my project team. Things were going fine. Then the pantry boy came in with the usual tray — tea, coffee, and biscuits. Just as he started pouring tea, Lala ji, without even looking up, dropped this:

“No tea. Tea is for labourers — they use their hands. Coffee is for managers — they use their brains. Coffee makes the brain run faster. Serve coffee only.”

Everyone in the room nodded like it was a TED Talk. No one dared pick a tea cup. We all reached for coffee like our promotions depended on it.

Now, I’m a tea person. A simple chai guy. But I played along, picked the machine-made coffee, and took a sip. It was bitter. Very bitter. Like-bad-day-at-work bitter. So, I quietly added one sugar cube. Still bitter. Added a second. Then a third.

I was trying to stir it silently, but of course, Lala ji spotted it. Without missing a beat, he said — flat, emotionless:

“Oye! Why are you using three sugar cubes? More sugar means diabetes. Diabetes means hospital. Hospital means insurance claims. Insurance claims mean higher premium. For me.”

Silence. Everyone looked at me like I’d just crashed the company stock.

I froze. Some of my teammates quietly pushed their sugar cubes back toward the tray, sipping that dark liquid like it was penance. I sat there, cup in hand, rethinking my life choices.

Then, as if this wasn’t enough, Lala ji asked the pantry boy to call the admin head. The poor guy came rushing in, unaware of what he was walking into. Lala ji pointed at him and said, again in that same tone:

“From today, no sugar cubes in the office. Only sugar sachets.”

And just like that, The Great Sugar Cube Ban was declared. By the next morning, sugar cubes had disappeared from the entire office.

As for me, I was left sipping bitter coffee with three cubes of regret. That’s how I unintentionally switched to a sugar-free lifestyle — not by choice, for sure. ",1,1745387760.0,delhi,2,0.67,False

Exploring the Concept Behind ""How to Improve Your Marriage Without Talking About It"" Book
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<section>In many relationships, the idea of improving a marriage often brings to mind deep, sometimes difficult conversations. However, some couples find themselves stuck in cycles of miscommunication or avoidance, making it hard to engage in meaningful discussions. The book *How to Improve Your Marriage Without Talking About It* offers a refreshing approach, focusing on actions and behaviors rather than words. It challenges the traditional belief that talking through issues is the only way to strengthen a relationship.

### Understanding the Book’s Core Philosophy

This book is based on the premise that emotional connection and intimacy can grow without the need for constant verbal communication. Rather than emphasizing dialogue, it suggests that couples pay close attention to non-verbal cues, shared experiences, and mutual understanding. In other words, improving your marriage can happen by changing how you act and react to your partner.

One of the central ideas is the power of **non-verbal communication**. Most people underestimate how much information is conveyed through gestures, eye contact, and body language. The book encourages partners to become more attuned to these subtle signals and use them to build warmth and affection.

### The Role of Actions Over Words

A key insight from the book is the mantra that ""actions speak louder than words."" When couples focus on doing thoughtful things for each other, it can restore trust and foster a positive atmosphere at home. For couples who find talking challenging, small gestures like sharing chores, offering a hug, or creating rituals of connection can nurture the relationship without uttering a single word.

For example, the book advocates for:

- Expressing appreciation silently through acts of kindness
- Creating shared routines that strengthen bonds without discussion
- Using physical touch as a language of love and reassurance
 
### How Emotional Safety is Built Without Verbal Communication

You might wonder how emotional safety, often established through honest conversations, can develop without talking. The book explores how consistency in actions creates a stable environment where trust grows naturally. When your partner knows they can rely on your presence and support—even through quiet moments—it breeds comfort and security.

Another important aspect is learning to listen *without speaking*. This means tuning into your partner’s emotional state by observing their behavior and responding empathetically through presence and patience. Such silent empathy can sometimes prove more healing than forced talks.

### Practical Tips to Apply the Book’s Concepts

Applying these principles requires mindful effort. Here are some practical strategies inspired by the book to enhance your marriage without focusing on verbal communication:

1. **Spend quality time together:** Engage in activities you both enjoy. The shared experience strengthens your bond quietly.
2. **Use physical touch regularly:** Holding hands, hugging, or a gentle touch on the shoulder can communicate love clearly.
3. **Practice gratitude non-verbally:** A smile or a simple nod when your partner does something kind shows your appreciation.
4. **Establish daily routines:** Small rituals like morning coffee together or evening walks create intimacy without conversation pressure.
5. **Be attentive to needs:** Notice when your partner feels stressed or tired and respond with supportive actions rather than questions.
 
### Why Some Couples Prefer This Approach

Many couples struggle with communication barriers such as fear of conflict, emotional overwhelm, or simply different communication styles. For these couples, shifting focus from talk to action can reduce tension and encourage connection in a less threatening way. It also helps partners feel valued and understood through meaningful behaviors rather than just words.

Moreover, this approach often appeals to people who express themselves better physically or through shared activities. It respects the diversity in how individuals give and receive love, reminding readers that strong marriages come in many forms.

### Integrating the Book’s Message into Daily Life

Improving your marriage without talking about it doesn’t mean avoiding important conversations entirely. Instead, it offers a balance where you create a foundation of trust, respect, and affection that makes future talks easier and less pressured. By embracing this approach, you replenish your relationship with warmth and connection that words alone might fail to deliver.

Ultimately, the book encourages couples to remember that love is shown through consistent care and attention, often in moments when nothing is said. If you want to bring new energy and closeness to your marriage, this perspective offers a practical, gentle path that honors the silent language of the heart.

</section>Practical Actions to Strengthen Your Marriage Without Verbal Communication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Non-Verbal Ways to Build Emotional Closeness

Sometimes, the strongest bonds are formed not through words, but through shared experiences and thoughtful actions. You don’t always need deep conversations to improve your marriage. Small, consistent gestures that show care and attention can make a huge difference in how connected you feel to your partner. These moments build trust, affection, and understanding without ever saying a word.

### Show Appreciation Through Actions

One of the simplest yet most powerful ways to strengthen your marriage is by demonstrating gratitude. You might think saying “thank you” suffices, but reflecting appreciation through actions often speaks louder. When you notice something your partner does, respond with a kind act like making their favorite coffee, leaving a small surprise, or helping out with a chore that usually falls on them. These actions let your spouse know you see their efforts and value them deeply.

- Prepare breakfast in bed to start their day with warmth.
- Take over a task they dislike without being asked.
- Give a genuine smile or a lingering hug when you meet.
- Plan a relaxing evening based on their preferences.

Such small efforts create a habit of kindness and encourage positivity in your relationship.

### Utilize Physical Touch as an Expression of Love

Physical touch communicates feelings that words cannot always capture. A gentle touch on the arm, holding hands during a walk, or a reassuring back rub can convey support and affection effectively. Touch helps regulate emotions and fosters a sense of safety. When you regularly engage in comforting physical contact, you create an emotional anchor that strengthens your marriage.

Remember, physical affection does not always need to be intimate or romantic; a simple act of holding your partner’s hand while watching TV or resting your head on their shoulder can naturally build connection.

### Create Shared Rituals to Deepen Your Connection

Daily or weekly rituals provide stability and intimacy, often without requiring extensive dialogue. These routines become special moments that both partners look forward to. For example, sharing a cup of tea every evening, going for a evening stroll together, or having a weekly movie night can enhance your bond.

Shared activities also create non-verbal cues and memories that reinforce your relationship’s foundation. These common traditions foster teamwork, companionship, and joy in each other’s company.

### Express Yourself Through Non-Verbal Communication

Non-verbal signals like eye contact, body language, and facial expressions are powerful tools to communicate love and understanding. Maintaining eye contact shows you’re present and invested. Smiling often indicates happiness and warmth, while an open posture invites closeness.

Be mindful of your partner’s body language, too. Notice signs of discomfort or happiness and respond accordingly with supportive gestures. This awareness encourages empathy and makes your spouse feel deeply understood.

### Enhance Your Marriage Through Acts of Service

Action often proves love better than words. When you notice what your partner needs or struggles with, stepping in to ease their load without being prompted sends a clear message of support. Whether it’s taking over household responsibilities, running errands, or preparing something special, these deeds enhance mutual respect and partnership.

Try to anticipate needs instead of waiting for verbal requests; this shows emotional intelligence and attentiveness that can strengthen your marriage profoundly.

### Use Shared Goals and Projects to Build Unity

Pursuing common aspirations creates a powerful connection between spouses. When you work together on a project, whether it’s gardening, home improvement, or planning a trip, you develop teamwork and communication skills without always having to discuss what’s wrong.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Such collaboration promotes a sense of achievement and belonging. It also shifts focus from daily stresses to positive, shared experiences that bind you closer.

### Encourage Playfulness and Humor

Laughter and fun can silently heal many rifts. Being playful with your partner—through teasing, jokes, or lighthearted interactions—releases stress and reminds you both why you enjoy each other’s company. These moments build positive memories and lower emotional barriers.

Spending time together doing enjoyable activities—whether dancing around the living room or playing games—strengthens your friendship. This solid base of enjoyment supports long-term marital satisfaction.

### Pay Attention to Your Partner’s Love Language Without Words

Each person shows and receives love differently. While some prefer verbal affirmations, others respond primarily to physical touch, acts of service, quality time, gifts, or non-verbal attention. Observe how your spouse expresses affection and make sure you respond in the way they best understand.

By tuning into these subtle cues and meeting your partner’s needs non-verbally, you can improve intimacy and satisfaction in your marriage without diving into deep conversations.

Remember, improving your marriage doesn’t always require lengthy discussions. Consistent, loving actions and non-verbal communication can create a strong emotional bond that defies words. When you commit to showing love quietly but sincerely every day, your relationship will naturally grow and thrive.

### Conclusion

Improving your marriage without relying heavily on talking might seem tricky, but it’s completely achievable. The ideas behind the book ""How to Improve Your Marriage Without Talking About It"" challenge the usual notion that communication is only about conversations. Instead, they encourage couples to focus on actions, feelings, and shared experiences to deepen their connection. By understanding these concepts, you can bring new life and warmth into your relationship without feeling the pressure to constantly discuss every issue.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Taking practical steps like showing appreciation through small gestures, spending quality time together, or using physical touch strategically can transform how you connect with your partner. These actions speak volumes and often communicate love and respect more powerfully than words ever could. When you pay attention to non-verbal ways of expressing yourself, you create an environment of trust and understanding where both partners feel valued.

Ultimately, improving your marriage doesn’t always mean having long talks or airing every concern. Sometimes, it’s about listening with your heart and responding with kindness and intention through your actions. This approach helps you build a stronger bond that is nurtured by what you do as much as by what you say. Focusing on these ideas opens new pathways to harmony, helping you and your partner enjoy a happier, more resilient relationship.",1,1745387431.0,SaveYourMarriageHelp,0,1.0,False

1k5rukp,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1k5rukp/girl_problems/,girl problems,"Can't really find anywhere else to post this so here we go I guess.   
  
I'm not really sure what I'm trying to achieve making this post. Just hoping that collecting my thoughts somewhere will help the universe acknowledge them. 

  
This one is about girl problems, but I'm not really looking for dating advice; let me explain. I am a college freshman at a pretty large public university, so there is of course a very large party scene and a great diversity of people who attend. Great, not my problem. Except I've had an exceedingly hard time trying to find ""my people"". To be clear, I have made a couple of guy friends who I have become really close to and who I really value having in my life. I am a STEM major so the ratio isn't great in my classes but there are still plenty of women about. I attend a few clubs pretty regularly, one technical and one more artsy. I am a pretty quiet person but I try my best not to be antisocial. I hang out at libraries and coffee shops often, enjoy a night out with friends on occasion, and anyways, case in point: I am not a hermit. 

I hadn't taken dating particularly seriously until I got to college. I did have a brief relationship towards the beginning of high school (which was very unserious. we held hands but that was it) which got broken up by my parents. As most people do, I figured this would be a good time to start taking dating more seriously. Some typical notes about me: my mom thinks I am very handsome, I think that I am very average looking but I take good care of myself. I look after all the usual things (dressing well, grooming, wearing deodorant (being in STEM stinks so bad)). I guess I'm a little chunky (blame the dining halls) but I maintain a regular gym schedule when I'm not busy with exams and try to keep a very balanced life. I have hobbies and am pretty aspirational about my future career. I'm not weird about jewish space lasers or whatnot. Anyways. I can't prove to you that I am one way or another but, after a lot of self-reflection, I would conclude that I am a very regular person with a lot of thoughts about things and hopes and dreams. 

  
Anyways, the rest of this post hinges around the following question: why is NOBODY interested in me? After a while of trying to ""let it happen on its own"", I tried to be more proactive in a non-predatory way in reaching out to women. If I saw someone I thought was cute a few times, I might write them a little note and slide it across the table towards them complimenting their appearance and giving them my number. Or, god forbid I was bold enough, I may say something to them to their face (gasp) and ask if they wanted my instagram or what have you. This part isn't all that challenging, but I have found myself getting constantly ghosted or ignored, even before I get the chance to go on a first date. On the chances that I have gotten the chance for a date, every time I  have ended up thinking it went pretty well (partly delusional, I'll admit), only to be told that I would make an ""excellent friend"" afterwards, if I'm told anything at all. On one hand, I can rationalize why girls would want to cut themselves off so harshly: the reality of dating in college is that sexual assault happens way too often, especially at a huge school like the one I attend, and if a girl senses a single weird vibe or even just isn't feeling it, it would make sense for her to extract herself from the situation ASAP to reduce the chances of something happening to her. This is just girlhood game theory. Let me build on my question from earlier to clarify what I am wondering: why does nobody want to take the chance to really get to know me? 

Ultimately a stranger online can't know the full context of my existence, but I am trying my hardest to not leave anything out of the picture that would make me seem undateable. I am quiet but try to be thoughtful and polite, have political opinions that don't involve treating women like medieval peasants, and have plenty that I enjoy about my life outside of women issues. I just genuinely can't understand why nobody seems to want to to really get to know me? It's a little bit of ""I have no mouth but I must scream"". I think I would make an excellent partner if given the chance. Re: thoughtful and polite, but also I really enjoy giving gifts and acts of kindness to other people, sharing food, and lowkey I am not opposed to throwing what money I have at flowers and nice dinners for the two of us, so long as she reciprocates feelings towards me first. It just really messes with me that it feels like everyone around me tripped and fell into a relationship they weren't really prepared for, meanwhile I can't even get someone to pretend to be interested. Some men drown while others die of thirst. One of the absolute worst feelings in the world is the knowledge that so many people just don't appreciate you at all. I don't need their approval, but at least their respect. 

So, why do I care so much about getting a girlfriend anyways? I am young and naive and have so so much life ahead of me! If so, 1) your arthritis prescription is ready at CVS and 2) PART OF WHAT MAKES LIFE GOOD IS ENJOYING IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY PARTNERS. I want to hold someone's hand. I want to share all the little details of my day and have someone else listen. I want to listen to all the fascinating little details of someone else's day. I want to appreciate someone and feel appreciated and close to them. A relationship isn't really what either person brings, but what you build together. Am I being punished for wanting something deep? Surely not. These are the kinds of things I thought that ""society"" would want me to want and what would be best for me to want. I don't know. 

  
Anyways hopefully this is still readable. If you read this far without getting bored, I really appreciate you. Thanks for taking time out of your day for getting to know a little piece of me. I truly truly appreciate advice but I'm not really looking for any, just company.

Im a F,24 who works at a coffee shop for over a year now and Z has been customer since like day 1 of opening the shop. I started working there and we didn’t click at first but then he started talking to me and I started talking to him. He’s a college student at the college i work next to and so he comes and gets his usual a couple times of the week. He is a senior and graduates in may of this year. I don’t remember his major, but i do know he is really fascinated with the Asian culture and even speaking the language (cant name which Asian culture/language). I was telling him that i used to live in that country when we started clicking.

Fast forward to this year, he told me he liked this Asian girl (who barely knows English) and they were close friends, and he wanted to ask her out but very hesitant but he finally did on Valentine’s Day. I was happy for him, i was the one that told him to not be scared and do it, i really liked them together! This past few months, i started realizing that im starting to develop romantic feelings for him.

My coffee shop is going on a trip and i can bring a friend (as a college graduate and new city i dont have many friends. Theres 4 employees at this coffee shop so we needed people to come along) , so i asked Z to come to be my guest, he said yes! Turned to find out, my cousin told me if she was his girlfriend, she wouldn’t let him go because im the only girl at this coffee shop and the only girl to invite him is suspicious. Moving on a couple days later, he had to cancel because he had a school thing.

Then, I realized he walked me out when i close the shop down, this happened three times now. The first time i didnt think to much of it because he is a really sweet guy, but three times was making me throw flags. Everytime he comes in, we talk for 30 minutes straight, nonstop. We had a ex employee ask my boss if we were a couple because of our interaction, there’s no touching, or anything like that, just talking or laughing. I do like talking to him, dont get me wrong.

Here’s the twist… the girlfriend is leaving to Europe for 5 months, and they want to do the long distance thing. ( i know this because he told me, im telling you we talk ALOT) Z told me hes scared because last week they havent been able to see each other because of college and other activities, and she’s leaving in 3 weeks. I told him in my experience long distance isn’t the way to go, but thats my traumatic past. This past weekend, they got to hang out and spend time together and he told me they grew closer, which kinda hurt but it is what it is. I told my manager what i should do, and he told me to wait for the girlfriend to leave.

Side note about the girlfriend, she’s pretty strict, but i feel like thats just how she was raised in her country and this is her first relationship. (Let’s the call the girlfriend “M”) I’ve only seen M maybe once or twice in the coffee shop, but everytime i see her she’s pretty quiet. I got Z to open up to me about their physical relationship, and he said they haven’t done anything other than a mild make out session, and M is very against PDA even holding hands is hard for her. I told my manager what I should do, and he told me to wait until she leaves for her trip and see if anything will happen.

Then i went to my boss about it because he knows more about Z than i do, and he told me the same thing and seen our interactions and believe there is chemistry or something there. My boss was telling me that he doesnt believe that Z an M are gonna stay together because they are still a new relationship and going to long distance for a long while is gonna be hard.

Yesterday, i was jokingly talking about my type of men to Z and i said i love toxic men and he pretended it to write it down, which I thought was a little weird but im not complaining. We do follow each other on social media, but thats it. He told me today that he is trying to throw a farewell party for M before she leaves, which also hurt but this is the same day he walked me out when i closed. Overall, i have no idea if this guy likes me or he is just a very sweet guy and we just are chatter boxes…. Help a girl out please. If there’s any questions, I’ll be here!

To the point:

1. Most importantly - **face and head has to stay non-oily**. I shower daily with two shampoos, one regular to disrupt the biofilm and wash off the greasy sebum, and one to treat the infection. Wash face during the day with soap or micellar water (better).

2. Once the grease is washed off, most anti-dandruff treatments work. Nystatin is the most effective, especially during flare ups (crush a pill, dissolve in just a little water, a few drops of shampoo, apply and keep on head for 10 minutes - daily for first 2 weeks). Eucerin with piroctone olamine and salicylic acid is great for maintenance. 

3. Carbs make skin and scalp oily. This one might be hard to do for some, but it works (I value my health, well-being, relationships and social life more than the food I grew up on) - **zero carb ketogenic diet**. No linoleic acid, zero seed oils. Bread, rice, pasta, potatoes are a no-no. Ketogenic **carnivore** is hands down the most effective diet, again especially during flare ups, just meat and butter. Once it's managed, small amounts of carbs and veg for sides are fine but it's a slippery slope.

4. Last but not least - **manage stress**. When super stressed and in a constant flight or flight (e.g. break-up), it could get bad, esp if I fall off the wagon with my diet. Stay centered.

5. **No coffee**. Coffee stresses out the body, artificially increases cortisol (that's why you're more awake), it is unnecessary and harmful.

Non greasy head. Zero carbs. Works 100%. It takes less than a couple of weeks to see improvement and sebderm is **GONE** in 6 to 8 weeks. Perfect skin, no itching, no hair loss. You just need some discipline. Good luck. ",2,1745386965.0,SebDerm,1,0.75,False

In Sweden I can walk into a really rather good Asian Buffet and pay the equivalent of 400 baht, includes a nice selection of desserts, drinks and coffee. Exactly zero places in Thailand where you'll find something similar. When people say Thailand is ""cheap"" they mean the streetside food places and maybe fake markets, selling stuff under ACTUALLY ""CHEAP"" conditions that would simply be illegal in more developed countries. Once you compare stuff like for like, Thailand is weirdly expensive. Cars? More expensive. The only major things I can think of where Thailand is a good deal is dental care, pharmaceuticals, gas/diesel, housing (depending on where you are) and perhaps International School fees. Oh, and a decent cup of espresso, that can be found cheaply.

Hunkal- Aranya and Tiger.

I prefer Coffee with milk and sweetner. Using 2 cup Moka Pot.

Any other coffee which provides great taste? I do not have Mola pot in India to try it. Although I have had Tim Hortons light roast, SB Pike place abd verona. These are not my thing. Lavasa Rosa Qulite was good.

Looking for recommendations and knowledge.

Most of us are here because we like the taste of Nespresso capsules and 3rd party OL capsules plus the convenience of the size of machine and the brew method. In short, we like Nespresso machines and the espressos/coffees they can make for us.

I don’t mind people discussing price changes for coffee capsules, machines and equipment, accessories, etc. I don’t mind any healthy discussion of what direction Nespresso is taking their product(s).

While I haven’t seen a lot of this happening, I worry about potential “brigading” by people mad at us for “knowingly supporting an evil company”. I’d like to see such rhetoric get warnings and eventual bans if the ranting continues.

We all know the machines and capsules we’re buying and the company that makes them. We’re making conscious choices to purchase the machines, accessories, and capsules made by Nespresso/Nestlé.

I’d like to see a rule in our List of Rules stating something about this, something that says we’re *aware* of the history and the complaints against Nespresso/Nestlé and we *are not here* to argue about the ethics of owning a machine or buying their capsules.

But I'm here half a year later to make good on my word and provide the ending of Tumblrina's involvement in my life. Half a year is a long time and part of me wants to apologize, but the other part of me says idk bro shit happens lol. You've had plenty of time to read the posts or watch the videos so we'll jump back in and I believe in you to pick up on the context. So I say once more, try to keep up.

It was Thursday morning. I usually sleep like a log, but I'd spent the entire night tossing and turning, anxiety gnawing at my sanity like Tumblrina through a package of stale and ill-gotten cookies. It was a grim portent of things to come. I knew that today, somehow, some way, the fruit-rollup heist would come back to bite us all. It wasn't a question of 'if', but rather 'when.' Was it going to manifest as pre-diabetes or a brush with Johnny Law? I mean... I did tell you outright in part 4. And I'm pretty sure Tumblrina was far beyond pre-diabetes.

Anyways, of course Coworker had been filled in on yesterday's sugar-laden dumpster-dive disaster. I also told him all about the weird vague sense of dread that settled on me last night. We both agreed that something needed to be done before this situation spiraled completely out of control. It was sorta of already mid-spiral... And doing something had been our position from the start. But we had no cards to play, so what exactly could we do? Stay fuckled in and brace for impact. That was fine. We'd probably survive the impact.

As the morning began, things remained eerily quiet. Usually relaxing, but for some reason I felt a little uneasy. I arrived early, sipping nervously on my coffee while keeping a watchful eye on the parking lot. It was empty. No Astrovan, no cigarette smoke wafting through the air. Maybe, just maybe, she'd gotten the message. My mood slowly began to creep towards foolishly optimistic.

Ten minutes later, just as I had gathered myself and decided I was ready for whatever the day threw at me... the door burst open with a theatrical flourish, and there was Tumblrina in all her unwashed, blue-haired glory, clutching her ""victory"" coffee from the local gas station. She wore the same stained, Speedy Gonzales t-shirt from yesterday, now garnished with new cigarette burns and mustard stains. She practically beamed with misplaced pride.

""Good morning, OP!"" she sang out, voice dripping with a smugness that I knew meant trouble. ""How did the kids sleep after my little gift yesterday? I bet they dreamt of sugary freedom!""

""Actually, I was wanted to talk to you about that,"" I said, forcing calmness into my voice. ""Do you realize those fruit-rollups were stolen property? It doesn't seem like you even realize that what you did is wrong...""

Her face dropped instantly. ""Stolen? Wrong? Ohhh.... No, no, no! You poor brainwashed little idiot. That's capitalist propaganda. I liberated those rollups.""

I sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose. ""Stealing is stealing, Tumblrina. You can't just take things. There are consequences. You are living in a nicotine-fueled fantasyland. One day the MAN(tm) is gonna slap you in the mouth really fucking hard.""

She scoffed, waving me off dismissively. ""I fight against the oppressive chains of capitalism every day. You're just too indoctrinated by society's programming to see it.""

""Sure, whatever,"" I barked, deciding to focus instead on the incoming children. I wanted to scream about how society only functions because of the social contract. Scream that it was her and people like her who were single-handedly destroying what was a high-trust society once upon a time. Is it that difficult to be honest? To work for the things you want? It's a damned shame, that's what I'll say. I go on enough about it in my own brain. I don't need to turn this post into the same.

So, kids began arriving, trickling in with sleepy smiles and their favorite toys in hand. Petey bounded in, clutching his favorite dinosaur figurine, immediately showing it off to me proudly. He calls it a para-sore-ofo-lus, which I'm told is quite similar to its actual name... So yeah, cool. Impressive. Tumblrina hovered awkwardly, offering stiff greetings and even stiffer smiles to the parents dropping off their children. For once, she seemed somewhat subdued, probably sensing my unspoken hostility. She knew she was on thin ice, even if speaking that fact out loud would crack the thin veneer and douse her with an icy spray of reality... She couldn't admit it to me, but I could see it in her face. Guilt. Or maybe she just had to poop really bad.

Morning playtime rolled around and I set up a simple arts-and-crafts activity involving construction paper and glitter glue. Have I told you how much I hate glitter yet? The glue version is only marginally better. Kids always get excited for the sparkles though, so I submit to their collective wills. Tumblrina quickly took a hands-off approach, opting instead to sit in the corner and scroll through her phone, occasionally muttering about ""capitalist media lies"" loud enough for me to overhear but soft enough for the kids to ignore.

""Miss Science, look at my butterfly!"" Petey shouted enthusiastically, holding up a piece of paper drowning in blue glitter.

""That's amazing, Petey!"" I praised, making a mental note to buy more cleaning supplies. Glitter, as we all know is the herpes of craft supplies. The carpet was already a battlefield, sparkly landmines of glittery goop everywhere. My hope was fading rapidly, but my smile remained plastered, because working at a daycare meant perfecting the fine art of controlled panic.

“Miss Science! Look, my dragon has three heads!” shouted another child, proudly holding aloft what appeared to be a green blob with googly eyes drowning in an ocean of gold glitter.

“That’s so creative, kiddo! Keep up the good work,” I praised, knowing full well that the dragon in question would soon shed half of its golden scales onto my clothes... But the kids just look so happy. How are you supposed to break their little hearts? The secret is never letting them discover glitter in the first place. Classes these days are much easier on my sanity.

But back then, in that moment with glitter glue effectively coating every surface, including the inside of my soul, I decided it was time to shift gears. The sensory bins were usually a good follow-up activity—low mess, easy cleanup—at least compared to the apocalypse of sparkly goo now haunting my dreams.

""Okay, my little artists, let's clean up our masterpieces and head over to the sensory station!"" I chirped with forced cheerfulness, silently mourning the carpet beneath my feet. It would never be unsparkley in quite the same way again.

The children cheered excitedly, their attention spans relieved to move onto something else. Within minutes, everyone was happily occupied with the plastic tubs filled with rice. Still messy, but vacuumable. Pouring, scooping, giggling... These little moments always remind me why I loved this job so much, even if it often involved insane coworkers and questionable fruit snacks. And just to be perfectly clear, I don't include Coworker in the 'insane coworkers' part.

Speaking of coworker, at some point in the morning after Tumblrina arrived I had shot a text to Coworker, and I do remember the exchange verbatim.

Me: ""We were wrong. She came back. The Lord has returned our gelatinous fog machine to us.""

Coworker: ""I think he just hates me because I'm gay."" was his reply...

Me: ""Then I'm gonna need you to start parking the beef bus in tuna town.""

Coworker: ""Is that a come-on?""

Me: ""Fuck you.""

...We have fun. Anyways, back in the real world I began glancing around, and I noted Tumblrina had withdrawn back into her corner of doom, huddled over her phone again, periodically letting out pained moans loud enough for everyone to hear but carefully avoiding direct eye contact with me. Classic manipulation tactic.

Still, I felt obligated, both by professionalism and morbid curiosity, to approach her. I must truly be a masochist...

""Tumblrina, I'd like to speak with you,"" I said, beckoning her to the kitchen area. She reluctantly peeled herself away from her digital soapbox, hobbling dramatically after me, clutching her stomach with exaggerated agony. Every step was punctuated with a groan.

""What is it now, OP?"" she snapped irritably, eyes darting between me and the fridge.

I kept my tone neutral. ""Is this stomach thing going to be a real issue today? Because, honestly, if you need to go home and rest then you should probabl-""

""I ate too many fruit rollups, okay?!"" she barked defensively. ""It's not even your business!""

""I mean, it's literally my business if you vomit on the children,"" I deadpanned. ""How many exactly is 'too many'? I'm genuinely curious.""

She looked away sheepishly, suddenly very interested in the cracks in the ceiling. ""Maybe, like… a couple boxes.""

My eyes widened, and my jaw fell open. ""A couple of…boxes? As in entire boxes of fruit rollups?""

She nodded sullenly. ""They were just sitting there. Free for the taking. Besides, my boyfriend helped!""

Great. The return of the phantom boyfriend. ""And he's not sick?""

She looked at me as though I were insane. ""Of course not. He's strong. Unlike some of us.""

""Well,"" I sighed, ""if you feel worse, please feel free to head home. Seriously. I won't even tell Big Boss. It'll be our secret."" ...It wouldn't have been our little secret of course. I was gonna use that slack line to hang her out to dry! But my duplicitous plot was foiled by Tumblrina's own ineptitude and lack of social graces.

Her eyes narrowed suspiciously, her piggy mind was whirring away behind those tiny eyes. She was either working really hard to unpack what I'd just said, or she's coming up with a way of ""misinterpreting"" my kindness. For once in her life, she succeeded.

Tumblrina: ""Oh no, OP. I'm not going anywhere. You need me here. One day you'll realize that. Maybe today.""

She waddled triumphantly away, leaving me utterly dumbfounded. I stared at the spot where she stood, my mouth opening and closing silently, trying to form words that could adequately express my disbelief. She truly was just an immovable stump of a human being. She'd shift from victim to liberator to best buddy to worst pal like a chameleon changing its colors. I wondered if she even actually thought about it, or if it was ingrained into her DNA.

Coworker chose that moment to stroll in (significantly earlier than usual). He was casually sipping a coffee and greeting the kids. He paused, observing my slack-jawed state. ""Oh, nice. Your morning is already off to a good start, huh?""

I recounted the recent conversation, which left him doubled over with laughter. ""Two whole boxes? She's literally weaponizing diabetes!""

""It's not funny,"" I groaned, though I was smiling too. ""It's disturbing. But at least she's quiet today.""

""True,"" he conceded, glancing at the human beanbag occupying the corner. ""Let's just ride this out.""

And ride it out we did. At least, for a whole five minutes before snack time once again devolved into chaos.

""Miss Science, the fishies are swimming on the floor!"" Petey squealed excitedly.

Confused, I looked over to find Tumblrina had somehow spilled the entire container of goldfish crackers all over the carpet. She was now gingerly picking them up one by one and placing them back into the tub.

""They're still good!"" she announced defensively, catching my horrified stare. ""Five second rule applies, comrades!""

Coworker just stared, visibly dying inside. ""You realize they're toddlers, right? Not tiny raccoons?""

I sighed, defeated. ""Holy f-...Tumblrina, I... Can you... Just... throw them away. Please.""

She did, grumbling bitterly about ""wasting perfectly good food,"" the irony of her concern for wastefulness was of course entirely lost on her.

Following snack time’s forced cleanup, we headed toward the kitchen for lunch. The kids, blissfully unaware of the lingering goldfish catastrophe, were stoked. Today’s menu: dinosaur nuggets, juice boxes, and little cups of rainbow yogurt — the holy trinity of toddler fine dining.

I was plating up the food, mentally reminding myself that yes, glitter is not a food group and no, I should not cry in front of the children. Coworker handled drinks, doing his best barista impression with a tray of lukewarm apple juice.

That’s when I noticed Tumblrina fishing through her tote bag like a raccoon at a campsite, and from its depths, she triumphantly produced a crumpled gas station bag and slapped it onto the counter like a reverse birthday gift.

“I brought lunch,” she declared, as if she'd hunted and gathered it herself. She then pulled out a family-sized bag of off-brand Flamin’ Hot Cheese Curls, an expired Lunchables, and a dented can of room-temperature Monster. Original flavor. The green one. Of course.

“She’s eating like a Twitch streamer during finals week.” Coworker muttered.

She ripped open the Lunchables and began stacking the wet meat circles like little pink poker chips, muttering about how ""meat is a capitalist construct"" while simultaneously eating ALL of it. No cheese. No crackers. Just sweaty meat discs. Raw-dogged straight from the tray.

""Are those even safe to eat?"" I asked, stunned.

""Expiration dates are a scam,"" she said confidently, before biting into a cheese curl like it owed her money. ""It’s all just big pharma trying to make us sick with preservatives.""

“You are sick...” I muttered under my breath, while Petey quietly asked if her tongue was bleeding (it was probably just red dust from the curls).

The smell of the meat, the neon dust, the Monster fumes—it all combined into a singular olfactory hate crime. My appetite died quietly in the corner. The kids happily chattered and munched. Coworker backed away slowly like she was a bear and he’d just made eye contact.

Then, just as I was going to go full health code violation and ask her to not eat fermenting pork sheets near the toddlers, there came a knock at the door that caught everyone's attention.

I walked over hesitantly, opening the door to two stern-looking police officers. My heart stopped.

""Are you in charge here?"" asked one officer authoritatively.

""Uh, yes, I'm Miss Science… what's happening?""

""We have a warrant for the arrest of an employee. Are you familiar with a blue-haired female, approximately..."" he consulted a notebook, ""...very large?""

Behind me, I heard the sound of a gas station plastic bag hitting the floor. Followed by an overly theatrical gasp.

“THIS IS MADNESS!” Tumblrina shrieked, clutching her Monster can like it was a Bible. “I’VE DONE NOTHING WRONG!”

""Ma'am,"" the officer said calmly, ""is that your vehicle out front—the van covered in flypaper?""

""Yeah? So what?"" she demanded indignantly. ""Are you oppressing me because of my artistic expression? Is it illegal to express yourself through mixed media? Is this what we’ve come to?! ARTISTIC CENSORSHIP?!”

He ignored her theatrics. ""We have footage of that vehicle involved in a liquor store robbery last week over in Birch County.""

The entire room fell silent, the only sound being a toddler whispering loudly, ""What's liquor?"" No time to address that right now. This was a mind-blowing revelation for everyone involved, including Tumblrina from the looks of things.

Tumblrina's face blanched, genuinely confused. ""Liquor store? I've never!""

But the second officer stepped in firmly. ""Surveillance video clearly shows that van serving as the getaway vehicle. Ma'am, you're under arrest.""

""What?! No!"" She flailed dramatically as they approached, listing her standard complaints: ""Capitalist oppression! White supremacy! You're silencing my truth!""

As they cuffed her, one officer calmly recited charges: ""Ma'am, charges include conspiracy, obstruction, identity theft, extortion, and fraud.""

That’s when she decided to go full Tumblrina.

“No! I will NOT be arrested by agents of a corrupt, colonialist empire! I am a sovereign citizen of my own body and my own lived truth!” She stomped a foot. “Do you even KNOW how many hate crimes are committed against fat people every day?! This is a violation of my-”

The second officer reached for her arm. Big mistake. She flailed. Like, full-arm helicopter flailing. One of the kids let out a cheer. Another yelled, “She’s doing kung-fu!”

“She’s resisting,” one officer muttered.

“I’M EXPRESSING!” she barked back. “This is an expressive flail! Do not interpret my resistance as aggression! This is defensive twerking!”

And then she tried to waddle backwards out the door. Didn’t even make it halfway before tripping over her own tote bag, landing with a seismic thud that shook the glitter out of the carpet. She groaned, still clutching the Monster like it held the power to restore her rights.

At this point, both cops were visibly over it.

“Ma’am, please stop yelling about capitalism and get up.”

Eventually, they got the cuffs on her. She screamed about “fatphobia” the whole time, called them “pigs” (ironic), and shouted that she’d be suing everyone here for emotional violence.

“I hope you’re ready to LOSE EVERYTHING when my boyfriend uploads the footage!” she shrieked.

“Oh good,” I said, unable to resist, “because the police are definitely afraid of a guy who’s too scared to buy his own Lunchables.”

The taller officer gave me a *look*, but didn’t say anything. Just gently guided the monster woman through the door as she wailed about fascism and food deserts. The children waved like it was a field trip bus leaving. One of them shouted, “BYE MISS BLUEHAIR!” like she was heading to summer camp.

When the reality of the situation finally sunk in, my jaw hit the floor so hard I'm surprised it didn't shatter. Identity theft? Extortion? Fraud?! Who exactly had we been harboring?! It finally made sense why she had flypapered her van to cover up any identifying lewd anime stickers. Was she involved in the robbery? Just a getaway driver? Maybe her boyfriend just borrowed her van to do it...

Coworker whispered loudly, ""Did we just work alongside a criminal mastermind?""

""I think 'mastermind' is a strong word…"" I murmured numbly.

As they escorted her out, Tumblrina spun toward me, eyes wild. ""You'll see! You need me here! This place will collapse without me!""

I smiled gently, unable to resist. ""Actually, I think we'll manage. Good luck with capitalism behind bars! Something tells me that you'll thrive in a cigarette and booty-based economy.""

The children waved, entirely unfazed. Petey shrugged, wisely saying, ""I didn't really like her snacks anyway."" You got that right Petey... The price for interacting with this person had been far too high. Mentally, physically, spiritually.

As the police cruiser disappeared down the street, I just stood there like a Dollar Tree Greek statue, glitter in my hair and PTSD in my soul. The children had returned to their usual shrieking, juice-box-huffing chaos, but I was frozen in place. My brain couldn’t quite reconcile that yes, Tumblrina had just been arrested… at work, for being the plus-sized getaway driver in a liquor store robbery. And I was expected to go back to supervising finger painting like that didn’t just happen. Like I hadn’t been one degree of separation from felony charges via a woman who once tried to argue that cinnamon rolls were “gendered food.”

Coworker eventually emerged from the kitchen with that smug little half-grin he gets when he knows I’m spiraling.

“Well,” he said, like it was nothing. “At least she didn’t poop on the carpet.”

“I feel like that was next,” I murmured, still staring out the window. “You don’t just hit peak Tumblrina and then stop climbing.”

He nodded sagely, like we were war generals reflecting on the last battle. “A true legbeard doesn’t fall. She simply plateaus at chaos.”

We didn't talk much after that. We didn’t need to. We just co-existed in the kind of silence that can only form after watching a woman with a Lunchables addiction get taken away in handcuffs.

The rest of the day passed uneventfully, though I did find a mashed-up fruit rollup under the sensory bin... hardened like ancient amber, entombing a single goldfish cracker inside. I decided to keep it. I don’t know why. Maybe someday it’ll end up in a museum exhibit about the decline of western society. “Here lies the reason this woman snapped.”

Later, after the last kid left and the lights were off, I sat alone with my thoughts. It would’ve been poetic if I stared into the abyss or something, but in reality I stared into a half-empty container of disinfectant wipes and thought, God I hope no one new gets hired next week.

Then I remembered the first Mr. Potato Head I ever threw. That stupid plastic head soaring through the air like a patriot missile launched out of pure maternal rage. I think that was the moment everything shifted. The point of no return. I became the Potatohead Thrower. The one who flung a toy at a moving vehicle out of righteous childcare fury. And maybe... maybe I’d do it again.

Later, as parents came to pick up their children, I braced for awkward conversations explaining why the daycare had briefly become a scene from Law & Order. Surprisingly, most parents merely shrugged. The kids couldn't repeat the whole story aside from Ms Bluehair going to jail and I claimed that it was an old warrant and nothing to worry about... Which it really wasn't.

One mother smiled sympathetically. ""We've all been there. Well, maybe not exactly there... but you know.""

Yeah, I knew. Sometimes, daycare meant dealing with the unexpected, bizarre, and surreal. But we'd survived. We'd endured a legbeard hurricane, a glitter glue apocalypse, and somehow still managed to smile at the end of the day. The beast was out of my hair permanently, and I couldn't be more grateful for that. I'm not sure what happened to her behind bars. I didn't care enough to keep track, although I did hear through the grapevine that she got shivved for trying to tell the Aryan Sisters about their white privilege. 

As I locked up presently, Coworker smirked, nudging me gently. ""Ready for tomorrow?""

I laughed, tired but genuine. ""If we survived Tumblrina, I think we can handle anything.""

And we could... The daycare kept chugging along. Big Boss didn't end up relying on me more as she should've and so we met plenty of other strange coworkers along the way that stayed for far too long... But those are tales for another time. I hope that you won't judge me too harshly for dragging ass on this final entry, and thank you to ReddX for all that he does with his amazing platform.",1,1745386095.0,ReddXReads,0,1.0,False

In a city where power is poison and justice is a ghost, Elias walks the razor’s edge between vengeance and oblivion. Once a firefighter, now a living weapon, he stalks the ruins of Ironhaven a metropolis rotting under the boot of the Iron Syndicate, where the very air is laced with Oblivion Dust, a mutagen that grants inhuman abilities at the cost of your soul.  

By day, he’s a nameless janitor, scrubbing coffee and blood from the halls of his enemies. By night, he’s Wraith, a specter who phases through walls and strangles Syndicate enforcers with their own shadows. But his body is crumbling, his mind is haunted by the family he failed to save, and the Syndicate’s newest weapon: Project Pandora threatens to turn the city’s survivors into mindless slaves.  

Betrayal cuts deeper than Nullsteel. The Underground rebels are fracturing. And Elias’s daughter might still be alive (We still don’t know) maybe locked in a Syndicate lab or his hallucinations are wiping his brain.
Will he burn the city down to save her? Or will the shadows consume him first?

1k5ril8,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatMenDontSay/comments/1k5ril8/i_cheated_on_my_pregnant_wife_with_a_coworker_and/,"I cheated on my pregnant wife with a coworker and there are a lot of conflicting feelings, but she's open to having a threesome.","About a year ago a new woman (F28) started working at my (M34) workplace. I work in a restaurant as a line cook and she is a server. I was instantly attracted to her, but I'm married and she was also married. I've never cheated before this and I honestly don't know why I did it. I have a great life. I love my wife (32F) and the life we have built together. We've been together for 12 years and married for 3. This woman, let's call her Amanda, was in a bad relationship with her husband.

When she first started working there, I quickly learned that her husband was not fucking her. She needed to get laid. You overhear a lot of stuff in a restaurant. Anyway, she messaged me on IG one night to tell me that she loved the salad I made for her. We got to talking over the next couple of weeks and we became secret friends over text. It was hard to tell if she was attracted to me or just wanted somebody to talk to because she was lonely. She was almost never allowed to go out to bars or parties or anything like that because her husband didn't want her to. He tracked her with his phone and would get angry if she was in a place that he didn't recognize. He was verbally abusive and also would get physical sometimes. He pushed her down one time and she hit her head on the side of their coffee table. Before she started working there the cops were called to their apartment last January because of a shouting match.

Aside from being attracted to her, I really felt for her and her situation. She would tell me things and I would worry about her. She also was drinking heavily at this time to try to forget her living situation. Her husband would ignore her most of the time and fuxk her maybe like once a month and it wasn't good sex either. Near the end of May last year I told her how much I was attracted to her and wanted to do inappropriate things to her even though I was a little scared she might tell someone at work, but she never did. She confessed that she was also attracted to me but that we would just have to exist in each other's fantasies because she couldn't risk her husband finding out for fear of him killing either her or me or both. He owns a gun and apparently used to sell drugs and weapons. Also, his dad is a cop.

Despite that we started sexting late at night almost every night. She sent me videos of herself and I sent videos to her and we talked about what we wanted to do to each other.. We finally had an opportunity to fuck. I was leaving work and she was on break. We went to a secluded area and had sex in my car. After that happened she felt really guilty about it. She felt guilty because she liked it too much. She felt fearful of her husband but also still loved him at the time.

We agreed that what we did was bad and we probably shouldn't do it and should just stay friends and be professional at work, but I really felt a connection with her. I loved her and wanted to protect her from her husband but there was nothing I could do. I urged her to divorce him but she was scared for a really long time. Her parents seemed really supportive of her but she felt like getting married was the only achievement of her life and she let her parents down so much growing up, she didn't want to disappoint them by getting divorced. I encouraged her to talk to them which she eventually did.

We had sex one other time about a month later but fooled around a bunch more when we could find the time which was usually at work in the bathroom. Very risky stuff. She would tell me everything. She told me she had aex dreams about somebody else at work. One of the managers (M56). She told me that he asked to meet with her after work one night. She said she wasn't gonna go but ended up going and then tried to hide it from me but when I pressed her about it she said she had and felt bad about hiding it and asked if I was mad. It's weird because I had anxiety about it, but I had no claim to her. She was married to someone else and I was also married to someone else and nothing had even happened. He just hugged her. This happened in December 2024. Some weeks passed and I noticed she paid much more attention to him at work than me. She would stay late after close and sit at the bar and talk to him and when I asked her about it she was very dismissive towards me. She would act differently to me at work than when we were alone together because she didn't want people to know about us but sometimes it felt like she hated me. Oh also, the manager (we'll call him Joe) is married too, but is allegedly in an open marriage. 

Over the next couple weeks things escalated between them, but she still had feelings for me. I could tell.. It was a very confusing time for me. She wanted to end things with me because during the time we were having this affair I had gotten my wife pregnant. I think the guilt was weighing on her and she didn't want to destroy my family. I also have a 2 year old kid with my wife. I was also starting to feel guilty and was torn between telling my wife or taking this secret to my grave, but it became unbearable for me and I eventually confessed to my wife. She did not take it well. She was very sad and disappointed with me, but she still loved me and was glad that I had told her. We agreed to work on our marriage. 

When I told her that I had confessed to my wife she was furious and assumed that my wife would go and tell her husband what we had done, but I assured her my wife was not like that. She wasn't so mad at her as she was at me. The two times we had sex I didn't use a condom and I came inside of her (she has an IUD). Not using a condom was one of the things that she was most upset about because she told me that if I ever did cheat to use a condom and I didn't. A week after I confessed to my wife, Amanda told her husband she wanted a divorce. He wanted her out by the next day and made her pack up her stuff and move in with her parents. He kept all the gifts and the rings and also a lot of the furniture that was technically hers when she moved in with him and the bed.

Meanwhile, things escalated between her and Joe. I knew about all the things because she still talked to me and I started to get aroused by the idea of her doing things with Joe. She told me stuff but also wanted to protect his privacy so I don't think she told me everything. Her divorce was fairly easy because neither of them had any assets and were only married for 4 years.

I was working on my marriage in the meantime and this incident kind of revitalized our sex life. I realized I had not been honest with my wife about my desires and I really opened up to her sexually. Over the last four months we've had sex almost every single day. There have been ups and downs. She's pregnant so she's experiencing a lot of emotions. Sometimes she's sad about me cheating. Sometimes she is turned on by the idea of me having sex with Amanda. I wanted to make sure I was completely honest with her about how I felt. I told her that I loved Amanda, but that, it didn't change the way I feel about her. I love them both and it's conflicting. I told her I wanted to have a threesome with her and Amanda. Sometimes she is turned on by this and talks about it with me while we're having sex and sometimes she just gets sad about it. I get it. I understand that I'm a complete asshole and I don't deserve my wife or how much grace she has shown me.

So, the divorce was finalized in March. She got an apartment closer to where I live and close to where both of us work. Basically since the divorce she's been having an affair with Joe. They have sex probably about once a week. I know when because of the schedule. Whenever they both have a break together and leave the restaurant. I think I'm the only one that knows. Part of me is happy for her and part of me is jealous because I want her. I know she still wants me too and also has feelings for me but she doesn't want to complicate things further with my wife but she has told me she is open to having a threesome with Amanda sometime in the future after the baby is born. Joe has no idea that I know and it kind of makes me feel uncomfortable knowing so much. This last Sunday I finally met his wife for the fiest tike and despite them being in an open marriage, I don't think his wife knows he's having an affair with Amanda. I have no idea one way or the other and I don't want to interfere in his marriage and I don't want any of us to get fired. I like Joe. I like Amanda.

On top of all this, my wife is now 34 weeks pregnant and is having complications with the pregnancy. Our first child was born at 34 weeks because she developed pre-eclampsia and had to have an emergency c-section. This time around her blood pressure has been going up and it's possible that she might develop pre-eclampsia again. I'm worried for my wife and am just hoping we can get to 37 weeks so she can deliver a healthy baby that doesn't have to stay in the NICU. I feel bad about myself for cheating, but still have a desire to sleep with Amanda. We have a very strange relationship. I consider her one of my best friends and I love and care for her deeply as I do my wife. 

Only a handful of people know about my infidelity. My wife only told her sisters. I think she is trying to protect me from the embarrassment of everyone knowing I'm a piece of shit and I appreciate her for that, but I feel like I must tell someone. Someone that understands what I'm feeling. Maybe not everyone at first but eventually. A friend of mine did something similar of cheating on her husband in an office affair. She is very open about her cheating and tells people about it unprompted. She said that her affair is part of her and she needs to be true to herself and own her infidelity. I'm starting to wonder if I need to do this, too in order to live my authentic self. 

This experience has been a rollercoaster of emotions and it's hard to know what to do. Right now I'm just focusing on my wife to make sure she delivers the baby safely and perhaps sometime in the future we can explore our sexuality more. Oh also, Amanda has met my wife and she apologized to her and we've hung out a couple of times at her apartment and our house, but haven't done anything sexual together. It was only slightly awkward. What does everyone think about this situation? What do I do? Where do we go from here?

TL;DR I cheated on my pregnant wife with a coworker. The coworker is also having an affair with a different coworker. My wife is upset but still loves me and doesn't want a divorce and is interested in exploring our sexuality but is also depressed. I love them both and want to be with them both but my wife doesn't like the idea of polyamory but could be monogamish. We have a lot of ups and downs and my wife is high risk pregnancy.

1k5rfa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1k5rfa9/the_issue_with_proselytizing/,The issue with proselytizing,"This is mostly for converts to Orthodoxy, like myself, who came from a protestant background and for people who are orthocurious.  

I'm going to share a real story that happened yesterday afternoon. I don't share this story to boast or inflate my ego, but to show why the claim that Orthodox fail in spreading the gospel because Orthodox Christians don't overtly and aggressively proselytize or evangelize isn't a good one as well as why the proselytizing culture is insufficient. With that said, here's the story.

For some background: I live in one of the largest metros in the United States. The downtown area of the city I live in if rampant with homeless people. Part of the reason is that a lot of the homeless shelters were shutdown. So any time during the day, you can walk two blocks downtown and you will see somewhere between 5 - 20 homeless people. Whenever I'm at my law school library studying, I'll often walk a few blocks to get some blood flowing and grab a cup of coffee. Whenver I go for a walk, I often encounter a lot of homeless people, and often stop and get them some food or, if I have any change, some money. 

On this particular day, I was walking with no intention of getting coffee (I had already drank some from my library's coffee machine); I just wanted to get some fresh air and collect my thoughts. In any case, as I was walking, I saw a young woman with four kids, the oldest was no more than 8 and the youngest was no more than 2,  sitting on a little plaza area by the sidewalk . She didn't say anything to me, she didn't even look at me. Keep in mind this was the middle of the afternoon (around 2pm), so three of the children should have been in school, yet all of them were with their mother, and looked dejected and bored. After passing them, I texted my wife and told her what I just witnessed and asked her if she was comfortable with me buying the family food and withdrawing cash for them. My wife was, so I entered the nearby CVS and bought some sandwiches, water, yogurt, and chocolates for her and her children. I then walked up to her and offered her the food and $100. I additionally asked her if she needs any diapers (we potty trained our daughter early, so we have a lot of leftover diapers), got her phone number and said that my wife and I would be in touch soon to deliver her some supplies. 

Now here is where the proselytizing issue comes up: on the same sidewalk and directly across from the young lady were two Jehovah's Witnesses street preacher, who had their stand with all the little books and pamphlet. Not once while I was walking across the street and during the time I was in the store getting food, nor while I handed the food over to the young lady, had spoken with her, and had walked away, did I see them offer her and her children food or anything. The two JWs stood there and it felt to me like the homeless woman and her children were invivible to them. This isn't the first time I've seen something like this happen. During my lunch breaks at work, I go for a run on my city's walking trail, and I have seen JW street preachers not too far from homeless people lying on the side of the trail, and never once have I seen them care for those people. 

Which leads me to why I shared this story: it is easy to proselytize. It's easy to formulate arguements and talking points when debating people. It's easy to create a logical argument why God is real and why your religion or denomination or church is the correct one. But, it's a lot harder to see your fellow man and truly help them for no other reason than to help them. As I walked away from the young woman, I was reminded of the parable of the good samaritan, and how that parable is real in our every day lives. Theology without lived experience means nothing. The early church grew not because they went door to door or handed out pamphlets, but because they were the only people going out and being with the lepers, feeding the hungry, healing the sick, caring for the orphans, etc. 

The woman, who I must stress, did not ask me for any food money, didn't have a sign or anything, and seemed ashamed, heartbroken, and dejected to be in her situation, lit up when she saw me approach her with two bags of food and even more so when I gave her the money. Imagine how much more her face would have lit up if even 10 more Christians would have done the same or more for her. What if those JWs would have, instead of stand like Roman imperial busts, would have offered her food, clothing, shelter, or some sort of aid for the young lady and her children? The light on that woman's face would have been enough to light an entire city block? 

This is what I love about the Orthodox church. We are connected to the lives of the saints and church fathers. What is impressive about these men and women isn't what they preached, but how they lived their lives. We remember what they preached because of how they lived their lives. We know that their words are true because their acts revealed the truthfulness of their words. When I was chrismated, I took on the name John after Saint John Chrysostom. His sermons on the Rich man and Lazarus were cornerstone to my joining the Orhtodox Church. Proselytizing doesn't mean much if you're surrounded by a lot of suffering and destitution and don't directly aid those around you. Consequently, the issue with proselytizing is that while you may win converts, you never offer people a taste of just how good the Lord is. it's like having a baker come to your house and describe the texture and taste of a cake, rather than offering you a slice.

Lockhart?","I read ""Family of Liars"" right after ""We Were Liars"" and... I'm conflicted. Having been blown away by how much I love ""We Were Liars"", the prequel fell very flat. The tone, vibes, and characterizations of the aunts/sisters was consistent in ""Family of Liars"" but the whole story seemed rooted in only subverting expectations and shock value of the next big ""twist"". The character's choices seems so poorly fleshed out and inconsistent with how their arc develops in ""Family of Liars"". I'm so disappointed!

""We Were Liars"" was good because of the unique characters and the robustness of their personalities. Johnny is bounce, effort and snark; Mirren is sugar, curiosity, and rain; Gat is contemplation, ambition and strong coffee. These traits are fully expanded upon throughout the story. Each character is fully drawn out and makes sense! As a reader, they feel special.

""Family of Liars"" was an attempt to expand upon the mothers of the ""Liars"" in ""We Were Liars"". Hence, I was expecting to know more about the presumably complex relationships between Carrie, Penny and Bess. Perhaps something like the charming dynamics of Johnny, Gat, Mirren and Cadence.....

However, it's become obvious that ""Family of Liars"" doesn't care about their characters. It only cares about the protagonist. I just couldn't care about the other significant characters that drive the story. >! There was no complexity in Lor Pfefferman, a major character throughout the story that adds significantly to Carrie's introspection and growth/demise. He was just a one dimensional piece of shit, selfish almost-rapist that deserved to die. The drawn out complicated feelings of Carrie didn't matter because he was just a disgusting character with no redeeming qualities or enough self-awareness to make meaningful decisions to add greyness to their relationship. Who cares that Carrie was in love with him for a significant portion of the book? Who cares that Pfefferman almost had a compelling backstory that would make his final act more tragic? The ""final twist"" didn't matter because I already didn't care for him throughout the book. He was just a piece of shit through and through with no thought processes behind any of his choices and values. !<

I gotta say, there were indeed attempts for complex character development - >! Carrie's selfless protector to selfish murderer development, Pfefferman's ABANDONED selfawareness, Penny's vacillation between loving sister to psychotic selfish narcissist. !< All in all, ""Family of Liars"" missed the mark with what made ""We Were Liars"" so good - THE COMPLEX CHARACTERS.

1k5rd0m,https://i.redd.it/6tc082fcqiwe1.png,is any1 else borderline autistic about deals and saving money?,"i am obsessed with the price-value proposition of everything that I own, and I try to min-max my spending/enjoyment ratio all of the time. this takes up probably 40% of all of the thoughts in my head.

  
recently there was a deal where you could get a pack of 4 pint-sized cans of nearly expired greek beer for $2.99 at my liquor store (after tax equates to $0.82/pint). They were also selling 12-packs of near-expired sam adams for $5.99 (roughly $0.55/can) - so I bought 10 of the 12-packs, and 80 pints of the greek beer. I took 2 trips in my car and stacked everything up in the attic. 

  
McDonalds has a $3 sandwich deal, so I very often will get a McGriddle and a coffee and THAT'S IT and everything costs $6.70 or so. When domino's briefly had a 50% off all pizzas deal, I ate that every day.

  
When my friend moved out of his college dorm and I went to go pick him up, I found a bunch of shampoo that had been left behind, and I took all of it. There was a bunch of stuff and I was literally on my hands and knees on the floor rummaging around and trying to figure out how best to effectively take advantage of the situation. Over a full year later I am still only half way through the shampoo that I took from the floor that day.

  
My entire computer setup has been salvaged from my friend's old PC. I took my friend's old case from like 2015 and put a few new parts in it. My laptop is a school-issued thinkpad that I literally got in 5th grade that I still carry around with me and use.

  
I have t-shirts that still fit from middle school that I still wear (only around the house obv). Almost all of my clothes come from garage sales and thrift stores. 

  
My bedsheets have pink flowers on them because they were the only 70% off cotton sheets at target that fit my bed

  
I use a flip phone that cost $70, and my cell bill is $10/month

  
when I was like 17 and I worked at a grocery store, I had developed a scheme where I would buy myself 100x of an item that gave you $0.05 off per gallon of gas, and then I would return it without scanning the receipt (i had a coworker that was complicit in ringing me up for this fake purchase) - and then I would go out to the gas pump and literally pump free gas. I only stopped upon hearing that (obviously) other customers had developed similar schemes and were potentially going to be charged with some sort of petty theft misdemeanor. I also shoplifted frequently.

  
I will go to the store and buy their near-expired fully brown flash-frozen steaks and eat those whenever they have them for sale.

  
A wine store near me sells cigars, and I will go in there, and click the button on the little display case and patiently wait for the nearest wagie to come unlock the door for me. Then, they ask what I want (he already knows what I want - i'm in there 4x a week dont pretend you don't know me wagie). of course, I want the 2.99 factory smokes toro at the bottom left of the case. I point to it and he gets down on the ground and grabs it for me. Then, when I arrive at the register, I pull out my receipt from last time that has a 10% discount coupon on the back, and I make wagie scan it so I can save my $0.30.

When I lived with my parents I would hoard garage sale items in the basement and sell them on ebay. I just couldn't stop myself from buying something when I knew that the true value was higher than the sale price. I haggle with people at these garage sales and just hoard and hoard and hoard. I did actually sell a lot on ebay throughout high school, my highest month being I think $1000. I would do the same thing at Marshalls. One time I actually bought 12 weighted nike jump ropes because I knew that they were worth $10+ than what they were being sold for. I did the same thing with some adidas track jackets - I think I bought 14 of them in various sizes. I would initially be shopping at marshalls to buy underwear, or something I needed, but would walk out with an entire cart full of goods because I couldn't stop myself from buying something that I knew I could profit off of.

  
The only new things I'll buy are things that I've determined are worth the ""investment"" of a full retail price purchase. For example, fountain pens, fragrance, raw denim, and clothes from certain brands.

But idk","Soooo before i get into detail, the guy i have a crush on (M,22)(Let’s call him “Z”) is on Reddit, idk how active, so some stuff maybe blurred but ill try my best… here it goes

Im a F,24 who works at a coffee shop for over a year now and Z has been customer since like day 1 of opening the shop. I started working there and we didn’t click at first but then he started talking to me and I started talking to him. He’s a college student at the college i work next to and so he comes and gets his usual a couple times of the week. He is a senior and graduates in may of this year. I don’t remember his major, but i do know he is really fascinated with the Asian culture and even speaking the language (cant name which Asian culture/language). 
I was telling him that i used to live in that country when we started clicking. 

Fast forward to this year, he told me he liked this Asian girl (who barely knows English) and they were close friends, and he wanted to ask her out but very hesitant but he finally did on Valentine’s Day. I was happy for him, i was the one that told him to not be scared and do it, i really liked them together! This past few months, i started realizing that im starting to develop romantic feelings for him. 

My coffee shop is going on a trip and i can bring a friend (as a college graduate and new city i dont have many friends. Theres 4 employees at this coffee shop so we needed people to come along) , so i asked Z to come to be my guest, he said yes! Turned to find out, my cousin told me if she was his girlfriend, she wouldn’t let him go because im the only girl at this coffee shop and the only girl to invite him is suspicious. Moving on a couple days later, he had to cancel because he had a school thing. 

Then, I realized he walked me out when i close the shop down, this happened three times now. The first time i didnt think to much of it because he is a really sweet guy, but three times was making me throw flags. Everytime he comes in, we talk for 30 minutes straight, nonstop. We had a ex employee ask my boss if we were a couple because of our interaction, there’s no touching, or anything like that, just talking or laughing. I do like talking to him, dont get me wrong. 

Here’s the twist… the girlfriend is leaving to Europe for 5 months, and they want to do the long distance thing. ( i know this because he told me, im telling you we talk ALOT) Z told me hes scared because last week they havent been able to see each other because of college and other activities, and she’s leaving in 3 weeks. I told him in my experience long distance isn’t the way to go, but thats my traumatic past. This past weekend, they got to hang out and spend time together and he told me they grew closer, which kinda hurt but it is what it is. I told my manager what i should do, and he told me to wait for the girlfriend to leave. 

Side note about the girlfriend, she’s pretty strict, but i feel like thats just how she was raised in her country and this is her first relationship. (Let’s the call the girlfriend “M”) I’ve only seen M maybe once or twice in the coffee shop, but everytime i see her she’s pretty quiet. I got Z to open up to me about their physical relationship, and he said they haven’t done anything other than a mild make out session, and M is very against PDA even holding hands is hard for her. I told my manager what I should do, and he told me to wait until she leaves for her trip and see if anything will happen. 

Then i went to my boss about it because he knows more about Z than i do, and he told me the same thing and seen our interactions and believe there is chemistry or something there. My boss was telling me that he doesnt believe that Z an M are gonna stay together because they are still a new relationship and going to long distance for a long while is gonna be hard. 

Yesterday, i was jokingly talking about my type of men to Z and i said i love toxic men and he pretended it to write it down, which I thought was a little weird but im not complaining. We do follow each other on social media, but thats it. He told me today that he is trying to throw a farewell party for M before she leaves, which also hurt but this is the same day he walked me out when i closed. Overall, i have no idea if this guy likes me or he is just a very sweet guy and we just are chatter boxes…. Help a girl out please. If there’s any questions, I’ll be here!

The divorce papers lay untouched on the desk as I held the phone to my ear with trembling fingers. 

“Brother,” I said softly, “I’m going to divorce him. 

There was a beat of silence. Then, Nathan’s voice came through, calm and unsurprised. “Thalia, I warned you, didn’t I? That man… he’s ice Emotionally constipated. Sexually apathetic. A walking void in an expensive suit.“k 

A small, broken laugh escaped my lips. “I thought I could fix him. I really thought if I loved him hard enough, he’d love me back.” 

“You’re not a repair shop, Thalia. You don’t fix people like him. Listen, come to New Zealand. The beaches are beautiful, the men actually know how to touch a woman, Let Troy Green rot in his glass mansion, untouched and unloved.” 

I leaned my head back against the wall, breathing through the burn in my chest. “I’ll book the flight once the papers are signed.” 

“Good,” Nathan said, his voice softer now. “You deserve better. You always have.” 

When the call ended, I didn’t move for a long time. 

Then I stood. The corridor was quiet, the marble floors cold beneath my bare feet. I passed the guest wing, the lounge, then paused outside the room at the far end of the hallway.

That was Troy’s private sanctuary. A room he always kept locked. A room was never allowed to Tonight, it wasn’t locked. And from inside, I heard a sound. A low groan. Drawn out. Suppressed. I froze. My fingers brushed the edge of the door, hesitating. 

Troy was on the couch, shert half–undone, pants pushed down around his thighs. His back arched slightly, one hand gripping the edge of the cushion, the other working between his legs with a familiar, practiced rhythm. 

His head was thrown back, lips parted, eyes locked on the screen in front of him. But what turned my stomach–what turned my heart to dust–was what he was watching 

It was her Bianca. His stepsister.X 

The video was from a summer vacation, one we all took together three years ago. I recognized the scenery instantly–waves crashing behind her, the cliffside covered in wildflowers. Bianca was at the beach, laughing, hair wind–blown and sunlit, wearing a white dress that clung to her figure like a second skin.. 

She twirled for the camera, spinning like she was in a perfume commercial. She ran toward the waves, arms outstretched. She turned and smiled, radiant and playful.8 

And then–Troy moaned her name. 

“Bianca 

Not once. Twice. His voice was breathless. Reverent. I staggered back a step, the world spinning around me. The floor felt miles beneath my feet. My ears rang. 

This wasn’t the first time.“, 

I remembered the first time I caught him watching something on his phone late at night. He had fallen asleep with it in his hand. I told myself it was nothing. Then another time, I found printed photos of her in his desk drawer. Casual shots from family vacations. Blanca by the pool. Bianca in a sundress. Blanca smiling up at the sky.!! 

I asked him about it, and he said he was archiving old memories. I believed him. But tonight, there was no denying it. He was watching a video of his stepsister–and pleasuring himself to it 

I leaned against the wall and closed my eyes. 

The first time I met Troy was at a yacht party Nathan hosted. I couldn’t look away. He was nothing like the men I’d dated before he was mystery. And I fell. So hard. So fast. So stupid. I begged Nathan to introduce me. I made sure we crossed paths again and again. Eventually, he agreed to marry me.

For two years, I’d been nothing but a ghost in this mamage. A pretty shadow that cooked his meals, smiled at galas, and went to bed cold every single night. 

But tonight made everything clear. He didn’t reject me because he didn’t feel desire. He rejected me because his desire had nothing to do with me.X 

That night, I didn’t sleep. I just lay there in bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting for the sun to rise. Waiting for this nightmare of a marriage 

to be over 

And when dawn broke, I got up and dressed. When I walked into the kitchen, he was already there, sipping his moming coffee, flipping through a financial report. 

He didn’t look up. 

“Where’s breakfast?” he asked absently, like I was the maid 

I opened the fridge, took out a bottle of water, and answered without turning around. 

“I didn’t cook.” 

He looked up, blinking like he didn’t understand “What?” 

Willy HOLY WIats yong on? & 

I turned then. Met his eyes head–on. 

“Im leaving.” I said 

He stood up slowly, confusion etched into his face. 

“Leaving? Where are you going?“% 

I smiled. But there was no sweetness left in it. Only frost

1k5r9mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1k5r9mn/annual_leave_request_still_not_approved_after_4/,Annual leave request still not approved after 4 months of waiting.,"Back in January I requested a week's leave in June. My manager thought she'd approved it and resigned in March. Before her notice period was up something made me go back and check and I found that the approval hadn't gone through even though we'd talked about it and she said it would be fine. When I flagged it and she went back to approve it she found she no longer had access to approve leave and had to refer to our HR manager who didn't respond.   
I've contacted HR three times via email so I'd have a paper trail, no response.  
I asked my new team leader to follow up for me. No response, in fact they didn't even answer her calls.  
The HR manager is notoriously hard to get hold of. She spends her time working between home and the office and just doesn't take calls, respond to emails or Teams messages. I rarely get a response from her even when she specifically asks me for something. We are a fairly big organisation of 30-something people.  
Today she was in the office for what feels like the first time in weeks so I went out and got her a coffee. When I came back she was in a meeting so I wrote on a post-it note to please look at my leave request. She was on a call but I heard her audibly gasp when she saw the note as I walked out of the room. When I got back to my desk she'd sent me a message via Teams thanking me for the coffee and saying that she was really sorry that she hadn't responded but wanted to check with the boss about my work priorities before it gets approved.  
It's been more than 4 months. I had spoken with my manager and my team leader and we had already discussed what the plan would be for me to be able to go away with a clear plate. It's been an incredibly stressful time recently and I'm so frustrated by this, it's making me contemplate leaving altogether. It's stressing my marriage because my husband who is self-employed needs to make arrangements so he can have time off and we both want to be confident that we can actually make bookings for things and of course the closer we get, the more expensive things become.

Therefore, a good name should translate well FROM verbal speech TO written, more so than vice versa (a name that you see written and the spelling prompts you to pronounce it correctly aloud)

Take a name with two equally correct pronunciations: Madeline (Mad-eh-LYNN vs Mad-eh-LINE)

I'd argue that even if you want people to pronounce it Mad-eh-LYNN, it's still better to spell it the more commonly expected ""Madeline""

How often are we truly in situations where someone reads our name first and *then* pronounces it to us? Teachers in school calling attendance. Maybe job interviews? But definitely not terribly common especially as adults. And just takes one quick verbal correction to tell them ""it's pronounced X"" instead.

Whereas we have many, many situations where we tell someone our name aloud and they either write it down for us, or look it up in a system. Doctor offices, coffee shops, government services, even a new friend putting your name in their phone. In this case, if you have the less common spelling, you have to say ""Madelyn, spelled like M-A-D-E-L-Y-N"". This is 10x more common than the mispronunciation case, and takes 10x more time to correct someone who gets it wrong because you have to spell your whole name out for them.

Agree / disagree?

Since childhood, my dreams have often come true — sometimes with eerie accuracy.

In this particular dream, my sister forced me to enter Class 7A at our old school — a place we graduated from nearly two decades ago. In the dream, I really had to pee, but I also had this intense, eerie feeling. We both knew that Class 7A was haunted.

Then suddenly, I was transported into another layer of the dream.

It was night — the moon kind of  looked full and possibly red. I really had to pee.
I left my house with my sister to pee near a Peepal tree. The distance in real life is not even half minties far. While I & my sister got  outside our house, too pee, I saw my neighbor (a woman in her early 50s who lives oppsoted my house in real life) performing a large-scale black magic ritual on the outer façade of her house.

The ritual included:

Five tall candles, with a black one in the center.

A pentagram on the ground, decorated with flowers.

A huge black shadowy head she was praying to — no face, just a black figure with a lion-like mane of hair.


Despite being outside her house, I somehow had a top-down view of the ritual setup. A few things struck me during the dream:

1. She waited until the entire neighborhood was asleep to perform it.


2. I was shocked to discover she practiced black magic.


3. I was terrified that she saw me watching her — I wasn’t supposed to be there.


4. She wore white clothes and was completely emotionless.


5. In real life, we greet each other regularly, but in the dream, she ignored me entirely.


6. I felt like this was a significant night — an important date for black magic.



After I finished peeing on the ground, I went back home the same way. By then, her ritual was over — the candles were gone, everything cleared out. The only thing left was the dark figure she had created on the wall.

I remember seeing her inside her home, specifically in the same room where, probably three decades ago, her in-law passed away from natural causes.

At 7 a.m., my alarm woke me up, and I still had that unsettling feeling. While having my coffee, I noticed a nostalgic, heavy smell by my bedside — it reminded me of school mornings when I never wanted to go but had to. I smelled it three separate times, and each time it made me feel more anxious. So I made a conscious effort to stop noticing it.

Then, with a heavy heart and uneasy mind, I went downstairs to the living room — only to hear the shocking news:

The same neighbor I saw performing the ritual in my dream had passed away in the hospital during the night. She had been taken there in the middle of the night, put into the ICU, and apparently vomited before she passed. She was only in her early 50s. My parents  and neighbours have gone to hospital to figure out the cause of death and arrange a funeral  for her while i am here feeling unsettled, disturbed and looking  for answers in reddit.

This experience has deeply disturbed me. It’s not the first time I’ve dreamt about death or the dead. I often see spirits of dead people i knew in real life . — they communicate with me, ask for food offerings of meals they miss having.  I’ve even had recurring dreams of teeth falling out before death occurs, and I usually get an uneasy feeling about two weeks before someone dies though i dont exactly  know who is about to die.

But this is the first time I’ve dreamt a dead person performing black magic — especially such a grand ritual — and then heard of their death the next morning. I can’t stop thinking about it. The dream felt way too real. The red moon, the details, the feeling — everything.

Has anyone experienced something similar? What do you think this could mean?

Since childhood, my dreams have often come true — sometimes with eerie accuracy.

In this particular dream, my sister forced me to enter Class 7A at our old school — a place we graduated from nearly two decades ago. In the dream, I really had to pee, but I also had this intense, eerie feeling. We both knew that Class 7A was haunted.

Then suddenly, I was transported into another layer of the dream.

It was night — the moon kind of  looked full and possibly red. I really had to pee.
I left my house with my sister to pee near a Peepal tree. The distance in real life is not even half minties far. While I & my sister got  outside our house, too pee, I saw my neighbor (a woman in her early 50s who lives oppsoted my house in real life) performing a large-scale black magic ritual on the outer façade of her house.

The ritual included:

Five tall candles, with a black one in the center.

A pentagram on the ground, decorated with flowers.

A huge black shadowy head she was praying to — no face, just a black figure with a lion-like mane of hair.


Despite being outside her house, I somehow had a top-down view of the ritual setup. A few things struck me during the dream:

1. She waited until the entire neighborhood was asleep to perform it.


2. I was shocked to discover she practiced black magic.


3. I was terrified that she saw me watching her — I wasn’t supposed to be there.

1k5qy7w,https://i.redd.it/ns7zccw2miwe1.png,My game is not showing up at all under its primary genre on Steam. Is this normal?,"Hey dudes. Asked this in r/gamedev but figured I'd try here. 

I'm trying to figure out why my game isn't showing under the ""Strategy"" category on Steam, even when filtered down to niche tags.

It is not a ""your game isn't popular enough"" issue since: 1.) I can filter out games that are selling 0 copies a day this way, and 2.) it was not appearing here even when we moved >1000 units in a day. 

""Strategy"" is even in the top nav breadcrumb (as seen in the screenshot), but my game is nowhere to be seen under the category (or any sub-categories like ""Strategy Roguelike""). In Steamworks, I have Strategy selected as my primary genre and the Strategy tag prioritized high in the tag wizard.

I've also tried checking this while logged out and under different accounts that don't own the game.

Is this normal? Like maybe Steam just decided that RPG was a better fit based on player tagging and that took precedence over how I categorized the game? 

Happy to toss a game key to anyone who can offer insight here. Or buy you a coffee. Can I do that? If not, then I offer boring old gratitude. ",7,1745383852.0,IndieDev,5,0.82,False

I felt extreme tightness all over my body and felt like I was a thick balloon I could barely move and my left arm always very stiff and my hand was turning purple. So after a few hours it went down to 140/90 and I went to bed. Ever since then I have this pain in my head and neck like a stiffness. I waited a whole week to masterbate and did it twice. Everytime I did it I got the shocking feeling again that lasted the most of the day and went away slowly after a few days. It's been almost a month and still have the pain.

I'm fine eating the same thing over and over for a month if it helps me solve my issues or gets me in the right direction. Like, I'm cool just eating rice/broccoli/chicken over and over for a bit and then testing new foods. But what other foods are generally safe? 

Not even sure where to begin or what to say. But lately, it seems like anything I eat causes a crazy reaction. Almost like an attack. It happens a few hours after I eat. My body just goes into this mode where I start burping over and over, my nose gets clogged, my throat clenches up, and it can be difficult to breathe. The excess mucous is insane, in both my nose and throat. It's almost like I'm drowning in thick sticky mucous. If I try to spit it up, it's super thick and barely comes out. I've also had heartburn and my tongue gets covered in white specks or spots. 

I've tried allergy meds, allergy sprays, drinking more water, sucking on ice cubes, heartburn meds...nothing seems to work. I am also becoming very bloated lately and having trouble falling and staying asleep. 

I did keto a few years back and didn't have these problems. But otherwise I'm at a total loss as to what I should be doing.

And what makes things even more hopeless is that I see different advice for the same topic. People say to try an elimination diet...but it seems like every source has different advice. One says to not eat fish, one says fish is fine. One says do it for 2-4 weeks, the other says something different. Etc.

For the past 2 months he has been saying that he will leave her but will he actually do it? I do not believe it but I cannot remove myself from this relationship.

—

I am a 30 year old single woman. I met this man at work, I knew he was married. Things progressed and now we are in a full fledged emotional/physical relationship. His wife discovered us twice- once the text messages and once saw us as we were together in a coffee shop sitting (no holding hands whatsoever). I did not want her to learn it this way (I wanted him to come clean himself or not at all) so I talked to her and told her that there is nothing between us. She seems to want to believe this ridiculous thing and keeps going on in the marriage. My partner did not move out of the house he is living in yet saying it is inconvenient (he has too many stuff to move) and that to make sure his kids are taken care of he has to be at home and collaborate with the wife.

I cannot take this much longer plus I am not feeling too good about this whole thing myself. He says he will move out in September. I ask why not now, the answer is that he has to make sure his kids are arranged for. I don’t believe this since it does not take so long (or so short) to arrange for kids’ and the wife’s housing and school.
Despite knowing all this, i seem to be unable to take myself out of this relationship that is going nowhere.

1k5qqfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1k5qqfr/im_at_my_wits_end/,I'm at my wits end,"I apologize in advance for the very long story.

For context I'm a 27F and my dad is 53, diagnosed with early onset dementia at 50. During the beginning of his dementia, he was evicted from his apartment and was staying with his sister. He then accidentally burnt her house down so we found him a nursing home because she couldn't babysit him 24/7 and it wasn't safe for him to be left alone. I was living alone in a one bedroom apt at the time but just recently moved back in with my mom to help her because she just got a liver transplant. I'm staying here for a couple months while she gets back up on her feet and then moving back out into another one bedroom. I'm also a full time student, currently taking 6 classes, and have a full time job.

Getting my dad into the nursing home was HELL. He was broke and had no insurance at the time, so he got on Medicaid (Masshealth). Even after we got him approved for Masshealth long-term care insurance, no one would take him because he was too young. I mean NOWHERE. 

We finally got him into a nursing home and they kicked him out after a couple of months due to him being ""caught smoking in his room"", which they could provide no documentation of the incident. We fought it and he finally got back in after being sent to a hospital where he stayed for 3 months while no one else would take him. 

Upon getting back into the nursing home, I got a call informing me that he was kicked off Masshealth due to an issue with an asset during the 5 year look back period that wasn't previously caught. 

My aunt got a Medicaid lawyer on the case but the nursing home has been trying so hard to kick my dad out. To be honest, my dad is a huge asshole. I'd like to think it's the dementia but it's probably 50% him and 50% the dementia. He's horrible to the staff. He's violent. He refuses to take his meds. He makes all of our lives a living hell. His sister has since stopped talking to both me and him. I don't know what's going on with her Medicaid lawyer and she hasn't given me any info. The nursing home tried to appoint a lawyer to be his conservator and to help with his Masshealth appeal. After I had a call with the lawyer and she heard the story, she never called me back.

I have worked with 3 different social workers and they all say they have exhausted all their options.

Now yesterday I got a call saying my dad hit the nursing home maintenance man over the head with a coffee cup and they called the cops and had him removed from the facility. They refuse to take him back. He's currently sitting in a hospital, calling me every hour screaming at me to come get him like this is my fault. The case manager said they are having difficulty finding placement for him due to his age. I know in reality it's because he has no health insurance and no one will take him without payment. 

I got a bill a couple weeks ago for $220k from the nursing home for his unpaid stay after he got kicked off Masshealth. This is honestly the least of my concerns because they can go ahead and sue me for it and they won't get anything.

I'm just so tired. Every social worker, doctor, lawyer, case manager, nursing home, and hospital has completely given up on him. He's been bounced around between hospitals and the nursing home for the last 2 years because no one can find a place for him to stay. My aunt hasn't spoken to me since September and he has no family besides me. 

I have 4 more weeks of this semester and I'm trying to write a 25 page report, complete multiple projects, and focus on my finals while still going to work and dealing with him, and helping my mom after her transplant.

I'm so absolutely defeated that this has gone on for 2 years and it gets worse every day. I feel like I have put all of my time and energy into helping my dad when I have no idea what I'm doing. And in return all he does is scream at me, beg me to take him out to eat, beg me to buy him cigarettes, constantly be mean to everyone around him, and purposely do everything he can to get in trouble. He doesn't understand that he has dementia and he fully believes that getting kicked out of the nursing home means he can just move into his own apartment and this will all be over. He laughs every time he gets in trouble.

I really don't know what to do anymore. I hate to play the ""I'm just a kid"" card, because I know I am an adult. However, absolutely every single professional who is supposed to be helping, has left me alone to deal with this situation. I genuinely can't keep doing it.

More artists are blending indie folk with what used to be considered country-adjacent sounds: banjo lines without bluegrass speed, steel guitars used as background textures, and vocals that lean more Appalachian porch than bedroom pop.

Instead of slick builds and layered synths, we’re getting space — intentional sparseness. Even the visuals (album art, live sessions, videos) are starting to look more like they were shot on expired Kodak film at a rest stop in New Mexico. Artists who once leaned toward ironic detachment now sound like they’re reading pages out of their granddad’s field journal.

This isn’t about a full swing into Americana — it’s something subtler. The edges are lo-fi, but the heart feels raw in a way that calls back to something older than genre: storytelling with dust on its boots. Think: less Brooklyn coffee shop, more Wyoming motel hallway with buzzing lights.

Have you noticed this slow drift toward dusty, earth-toned sounds in indie lately?  
And if so — do you think it’s here to stay, or just another pendulum swing before synthpop comes back around?",5,1745382171.0,indie,4,0.78,False
1k5qhcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwipeHelper/comments/1k5qhcl/revenge_ban_how_to_get_unbanned_discussion/,Revenge ban??// how to get unbanned. DISCUSSION!,"Hi guys! Basically to make the story short, I met this girl off hinge, turned out she had a few screws loose, showed up with her friend at my place when I told her not to. Somehow passed through security at my condo, assuming she lied to security and said that she was allowed to come in and made it all the way to my doorstep where my mom told her to F off and then I told her I don’t want to continue anything and sorry. Following this was 38 no caller id miss calls and random numbers calling me and then a week later hinge and tinder BAN ME. I am assuming she told her friends to revenge ban me which is telling friends to report the account so it gets shut down. I appealed to hinge and they gave me the most generic boring response that they give to everyone else. Now it’s been 7 months and I really want a girlfriend since I never had one and while these apps may not be the best place to find one, you can always find some new friends and maybe their friend groups might have someone for you and ect. 

MY RESEARCH ON HOW TO GET UNBANNED// PLEASE TELL ME IF I'M RIGHT OR YOUR EXPERIENCES/KNOWLEDGE!

From what I understood, there must be a new phone, new location like a coffee shop or something, device to have never had any dating apps downloaded it on it, so I’m assuming you can just factory reset your phone and then make a new Apple ID (not sure here so let me know if this is right or if you just need a new phone that never had that same Apple ID logged into it), then new photos and new phone number. I’m assuming this all would make it unbanned including not putting the same name as before. 

My only confusions are do you need to delete hinge and tinder every time your going to enter your house or is that fine. And if using your old phone that had your Apple ID logged into it but never had dating apps on it before but was factory reset like brand new would still do the trick as you make a new Apple ID. everyone contribute to this thread please to help others as well, I read on numerous threads that for some reason people are getting banned for literally no reason. Thanks ladies and gents!

1k5qgu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/harvestmoon/comments/1k5qgu9/winds_of_anthos_anthos_expo/,Winds of Anthos - Anthos Expo,"I know that the Winds of Anthos came out quite a while back, but since there's a real lack of information on the Anthos Expo in Winds of Anthos out there from searching, I've decided to post these results of my small experiments during one (1) Anthos Expo on my game. The categories for Advanced were Lotus, Baguette, and Drinks.

Please note that I've only tested with the things I had on hand at the time, so certain star levels are not accounted for. Note that after countless save/reload/submit cycles, I am quite certain that the points given for each object do not change, hence I'll list the points I've gotten as well. Blanks mean I didn't have that option to test at that point, so I don't know.

**Lotus**

|Item|0 star|1 star|2 star|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Lotus|24|36||
|Water Lotus|16|24||
|Nirvana||33||
|Mountain Lotus|24|||
|Snow Queen|28|42||

**Mutations**

Lotus + Autumn = Nirvana

Lotus + Desert  Mountain Lotus

Water Lotus + Winter = Snow Queen

**General conclusions:**

\- If the unmutated crop matches the category (e.g. submitting Lotus for Lotus Category), it can get higher points than another unmutated crop of the same family at the same star level (e.g. Water Lotus 0-star gets 16 points while Lotus 0-star gets 24 points).

\- Mutated crops can get higher points than unmutated crops, but not always. (e.g. Snow Queen gets higher points than Water Lotus at both 0-star and 1-star level, but Nirvana and Mountain Lotus gets points that are less than or equal to Lotus at he corresponding star level). 

\- For crops that could become giant, I believe submitting the giant version gets 100 points. I remember getting 100 for a Giant Strawberry before. 

\-------------------------------------------

**Baguette**

|Item|0 star|1 star|2 star|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Baguette||46|63|
|Strawberry Jam Baguette|||27|
|Cream Baguette|||33|
|Energy Jam Baguette|||42|

**General conclusions:**

\- The basic Baguette surprisingly gets much higher points than any other Jam Baguette that I've tested at the same star level, even for the baguettes that restore more stamina hearts.  

\-------------------------------------------

**Drinks**

|Item|0 star|1 star|2 star|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Coffee|31|||
|Minestrone|32|||
|Energy Gazpacho|23|34||
|Energy Juice|||39|
|Chocolate Shake|||28|
|Mixed Juice|||24|
|Pineapple Juice||16||
|Orange Juice|31|||
|Tomato Juice||16||
|Cherry Juice|11|||
|Pumpkin Potage Soup|14|||
|Fish Chowder|||32|
|Corn Potage Soup||18||

**General conclusions:**

\- Drinks made using tree fruits only (Orange Juice, Coffee) get higher points for a 0-star product compared to things using field crops or milk (Cherry Juice, Tomato Juice, Pineapple Juice). It may be because there is no higher star level for tree fruits. 

\- I brought Energy Punch to test as well, but it was not under the options to be submitted. I think Punch may not count as Drinks (but could count as Dishes). However, the soups (in cups) and cold drinks (in glasses) count as Drinks.

\-------------------------------------------

Overall, things that match the category (if possible), and things of a higher star level will get more points. Also, the winning score could be quite RNG as I've seen values between 130+ to 230+ (but for this round, I never managed to win).

Also, the prizes I managed to get in this round of experiments are:

\- 2nd place: High-Quality Board Lumber x2

\- 3rd place: Opal x1

\- No place: Fertilizer x20

I hope that this was helpful in some way and I'm looking forward to trying more experiments with future Anthos Expos. Definitely please feel free to comment if you found anything inaccurate or have anything to add, even data for other categories!

fast forward a full decade, my friends told me this couple finally broke up, and that it was finally my chance (lol). the dude started to dm me, like my stories, etc. i was like “sure, perhaps he wants to have a date with me but so much time has passed that i may not feel the same way when i was 20”. 

we agreed to meet for a coffee and in the date i noticed that the chemistry was intense (from my perspective), that although he was older, he was super cute, that he was very much a gentleman, very attentive, sweet, smart and incredibly funny. i haven’t date seriously or meet anyone remarkable since my last 7-years relationship (i broke up like 3 years ago). so, i kept dating him, bc i clicked with him and i don’t really click with anyone. 

we then went to the movies, and on our third date we went to a park. in that date we started (very shyly) to make up. i was so excited and happy, but literally, after the first kisses he stops and says “i want you to know that im dating more girls at the same time” i was a bit shocked, because (1) i didn’t expect it (i thought the three dates we had were following the classical “im seriously dating you” scheme, not the “im just for the hooking up thing” scheme, it felt really serious), (2) he had the reputation of being a “good boy”, like boyfriend material, (3) i thought that being 34, he was looking for something more or less serious, (4) he didn’t give me any clue, (5) i think most people notice that im not the type of girl that hooks up for fun since im very shy/introverted. also, i was very very far away from home, didn’t have easy access to any public transport, literally froze and didn’t really know how to react, and well, i was enjoying (damn, 3 years without kissing anyone), so i decided to keep going. 

afterwards, he took me to his home, i literally met his mom (?) (he still lives with his mom, just like i keep living with my parents), lend me a sweater, told me he was happy bc the sweater would smell like me, i talked  with some of his friends that were hanging out with his brother at his place, etc. like damn, with this scenario i really thought that this could grow into something more serious. after that, he took me back to my place, we made out in his car, and in a very hot and tender way. 

the following week i was a bit troubled and spurred by the idea of being girl number 6 in his calendar. so i decided to be very honest, and on our next date i told him that i really liked him and that i couldn’t really keep going with this, not that i wanted a serious relationship but perhaps something more exclusive. he was very nice but told me that while he liked me he didn’t share the same feelings for me. however, he told me that if he suddenly felt in love with me, he was going to tell me, bc that is something that usually happens to him. 

so, as naive as i am, i waited for “i actually like you a lot” message. ofc, there was no message and i realised i was growing miserable seeing his stories on instagram and hoping for him to write me. after a lot of thinking (and crying), i talked to him again and asked him if there was really a chance for me, and in very honest but kinda cruel way he told me that i was his third priority; first place taken by his current serious lover, and then his ex. i realised that there was no chance, so i decided to leave it there and we agreed to act like nothing really happened, like to go back to kind acquaintances. we don’t talk, im not watching his stories and he doesn’t like mines yet he sees every single story i post. 

in order to overcome this situationship, because i felt really heartbroken and sad, and cried a lot, i decided (by the suggestion of a friend) to put myself out there. so i downloaded two date apps. the thing is, im bisexual, so i activated the apps for girls, boys and non-binary fellows. 

and well, in one of the apps i matched with none other than the this dude’s ex girlfriend. the super cute, sweet and hot girl. i didn’t know she was bisexual! probably she’s just bicurious and just want to have fun. we talked a little bit, and agreed to have a date. notes aside, i honestly think she’s one of the hottest girls i met at my faculty, and was one of my girl crushes (thou not as hard as my crush for the dude). 

however, i don’t know if i would be the asshole if i date her after having dated his ex. should i tell her? for the record, im not doing this for revenge. while it feels good to a certain extent, i really like the dude, in a romantic and non romantic way; i wish for him the best, it is not my intention to hurt him or anything, i just really think the girl is hot and would love to have a fun night with her. also, i know for a fact that she is just exploring and has no intentions of anything serious, no commitment, she just wants a good time, a fun, casual date. 

so, would i be the asshole if i date a girl after having dated her ex boyfriend to whom i had a crush on?",0,1745381906.0,AITA_Relationships,1,0.5,False
