’ve really been feeling the gap between paychecks and the cost of living lately. In our line of work, income can be inconsistent, but expenses never are. I did a spending check and realized a lot was going to convenience.

A few swaps that helped me:

• Stopped daily coffee runs — got a Tchibo machine that grinds beans (no capsules). Way cheaper per cup.

• I grocery shop a bit in Europe when we’re there (only US-allowed items) like pasta, packaged foods, and some household basics — prices can be noticeably lower.

Other easy replacements:

Netflix → Hoopla / Kanopy (library)

Audible & ebooks → Libby app

Buying books → ThriftBooks

K-dramas → Rakuten Viki (free options)

Spotify Premium → Spotify Free / YouTube

Microsoft Office → Google Docs

Photoshop → Canva

Grammarly Premium → LanguageTool

Electronics → Back Market( the best, I always buy my phones and computer there, never disappointed) 

Clothes → ***ThredUp***/  Vinted / Poshmark, thrift store 

Furniture → Facebook Marketplace

Gym → YouTube workouts

Meal kits → Budget Bytes recipes

Free/cheap stuff spots:

Nextdoor, Buy Nothing groups, Freecycle, Craigslist (free section), OfferUp, eBay, FACEBOOK MARKETplace ( I can find it all, just like Amazon but cheaper, eco-friendly, and no subscription) 

For me, this isn’t about being cheap; it’s about lowering financial stress. Even saving a couple of hundred dollars a month helps during slow flying months.



Sharing in solidarity,  If anyone has good money-saving swaps, please share.

We spent Christmas Eve at my parents’ place. Before dinner, my mother opened champagne, and later vodka as well, and we drank with them.
When we were ready to leave, we took a taxi home. We wanted to take the gifts with us (even though I had said beforehand that we didn’t need or expect any gifts), including a large item like a contact grill. My mother insisted that we leave the gifts there and pick them up at a later time instead.
For context: I had worked three night shifts before Christmas Eve and had slept only about four hours that day. As a result, I was quite exhausted and also fairly intoxicated by the time we left. On December 25th, I felt very unwell (bad hangover, exhaustion) and was not answering my phone because I needed to recover and sleep. My mother was aware that when I don’t respond, it’s usually because I’m not feeling well, also due to my anxiety disorder.
On December 26th around noon, she called me. I was still asleep but answered the phone. She angrily criticized me for not coming by and said that my husband should have contacted her. However, he had no idea she expected a call or visit — the only thing that had been communicated was that we would pick up the gifts “later,” without a specific date.
I explained that I wasn’t feeling well and that this had nothing to do with my husband. I also told her that he didn’t know he was expected to reach out. I was still unwell on the 26th and suggested we could come by on Wednesday, since both my husband and I had to work again. She responded in a sulky way, saying they had no time that day. For additional context, my parents are both retired, own a car, but always expect us to come to them, even though they live in the city center on a busy shopping street where parking is extremely difficult.
On New Year’s Eve, we tried calling several times, but they didn’t answer and didn’t return our calls.
The following Monday, I went to their place anyway because I was already in the city to buy a birthday gift for my husband (they live directly on the shopping street). My mother had tried to cancel by saying they were sick, but I only saw the message once I was already there. They were clearly not sick.
I stayed for about an hour and a half, we chatted normally, had coffee, and everything seemed fine. At some point, I asked if I should take the gifts with me now. She then said she had exchanged everything and suddenly tried to start an argument. I calmly said, “I knew you were going to say that,” politely said goodbye, and left without engaging in a discussion.
This isn’t really about the gifts themselves, but about the gesture — especially since my husband had nothing to do with this situation and was still included in the punishment.

I have had a small niggling feeling that a guy who works in one of my local shops has a crush on me. I'm aware that he might just be being nice (coming from someone who works retail too). I've caught him looking at me multiple times and sometimes he would give a little wave when I go to the checkouts. He seems very quiet, a little expressionless, and quite socially awkward which I find is REALLY charming! 

  
I gave him a Christmas card last year and things seemed to have picked up from there. I tried to make it flirty in a respectful way and he took it well! He approached me about it in public and thanked me for it, wished me merry christmas. We've not spoken much since then apart from a few hellos here and there. And recently he sort of exaggerated scanning my items through the till - arm movements - which my mom picked up on, as sometimes he serves her, and he doesn't do that. It struck me he might have been a little nervous. 

So much has happened it's a lot to put in this post.

  
But now I feel the ball is in my court and I want to ask him for a coffee. Not wanting to put him on the spot in front of people in person. Would it be okay to do it in the form of a V-Day card? I would only put my number and ask him in there.

1qsfplw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qsfplw/the_psychology_of_body_language_19_things_your/,The Psychology of Body Language: 19 Things Your Body Is Silently Screaming (Science-Backed),"Spent months down a rabbit hole studying body language research from FBI interrogators, Harvard psychologists, and corporate negotiation experts. The findings? Wild. Your body is constantly snitching on you.

Most people think body language is just about ""confidence"" or ""openness."" That's surface level BS. The real stuff happening is way more nuanced and honestly kind of fascinating. Your microexpressions, spatial choices, and tiny movements are broadcasting information you'd probably rather keep private.

This isn't some ""cross your arms = defensive"" recycled advice. These are actual patterns backed by behavioral science that change how people perceive and respond to you. And yeah, once you know them, you can't unsee them.

**The eye thing everyone misses.** People focus on eye contact duration but ignore quality. There's a massive difference between staring (aggressive/weird) and engaged looking (charismatic). Research from social psychologist Dr. Amy Cuddy shows that warmth gets evaluated before competence in first impressions. The key is the ""triangle technique"" used by seasoned professionals, you shift focus between someone's eyes and mouth in a natural triangle pattern. Keeps things warm without being intense. Dilated pupils signal genuine interest, which you obviously can't control, but you can avoid the dead stare that makes people uncomfortable.

**Foot direction is brutally honest.** Your feet point toward what you actually want, not what you're pretending to want. In conversations, if someone's feet angle toward the exit while their torso faces you, they're mentally gone. FBI behavioral analyst Joe Navarro covers this extensively in his work on nonverbal intelligence. Your own feet do this too. When you're genuinely engaged, your whole body orients toward the person. When you're not, your feet start planning the escape even if you're nodding politely.

**The handshake myth needs to die.** Everyone obsesses over firm handshakes like it's 1950. Modern research shows that handshake quality matters less than matching the other person's pressure and duration. Going too firm reads as overcompensating, too weak reads as disinterested. The actual power move is using your other hand to briefly touch their elbow or shoulder during the shake, creates an instant sense of connection and trustworthiness. Just don't hold it too long or it gets creepy.

**Mirroring works but only if it's subtle.** You've probably heard about matching body language to build rapport. It's legit, backed by neuroscience research on mirror neurons. But here's where people screw up, they mirror too obviously and too quickly. It needs to happen naturally with a slight delay, like 2 to 3 seconds after they shift position. Match their energy level and speaking pace before you worry about physical positions. The goal is unconscious synchronization, not a mime performance.

**Your phone placement says everything.** Keep your phone visible on the table during a conversation, even face down, and you've just told the other person they're less important than potential notifications. Studies on phone presence show it measurably reduces conversation quality and perceived empathy. Put it completely away, not just flipped over. This seems obvious but watch people at restaurants or meetings. The phone stays out and they wonder why conversations feel shallow.

**Chin angle reveals status perception.** Slightly raised chin signals confidence or superiority. Lowered chin signals submission or shame. Dead neutral is ideal for most interactions. Politicians and executives get media training specifically on chin positioning because it's so impactful. You want your chin level, not jutting up like you're judging everyone or tucked down like you're apologizing for existing. Recording yourself or checking mirrors helps you find neutral.

**The power of taking up space.** This one's tricky because it's gendered in application but universal in impact. Spreading out, using expansive gestures, and claiming physical space signals dominance and confidence. Contracting inward, keeping limbs close, minimizing your footprint signals insecurity. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy's research on power posing shows that even just standing in an expansive pose for two minutes changes your hormone levels. You don't need to be obnoxious about it, just stop making yourself smaller than necessary.

**Speed of movement matters more than you think.** Rushed movements signal anxiety or low status. Deliberate, measured movements signal control and confidence. Watch any CEO or experienced leader, they don't frantically grab things or jerk around. Everything is smooth and intentional. This extends to how you walk, gesture, even how you pick up your coffee. Slowing down by like 20% makes a massive perceptual difference.

**The authentic smile test.** Real smiles activate the orbicularis oculi muscle around your eyes, creating crow's feet. Fake smiles only move your mouth. People unconsciously detect this difference and respond accordingly. You literally cannot fake a genuine smile, your eyes either crinkle or they don't. What you CAN do is trigger genuine positive emotion by thinking about something that actually makes you happy, then the real smile follows naturally.

**Proximity rules are cultural but predictable.** Edward T. Hall's proxemics research identified specific distance zones, intimate (0 to 18 inches), personal (18 inches to 4 feet), social (4 to 12 feet), public (12+ feet). Violating these boundaries creates discomfort, whether too close or too far. Americans generally want more space than many other cultures. Standing slightly closer than expected can create intimacy and connection, but cross the line and you're just being invasive. Pay attention to whether people step back when you approach.

**Barrier behaviors are everywhere.** Placing objects between you and someone else, crossing arms or legs, turning your body slightly away, these are all unconscious protective behaviors. They signal discomfort, disagreement, or defensiveness. When you notice yourself doing this, it's worth examining why. When you see others doing it, don't push harder, you need to change your approach or give them space. The Definitive Book of Body Language by Allan and Barbara Pease breaks down like 50 different barrier signals.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into body language and nonverbal communication without spending hours reading dense research papers, there's an AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that's worth checking out. It pulls from books like Navarro's work, Cuddy's research, and other behavioral science sources to create personalized audio lessons you can listen to during your commute. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples, and pick different voice styles (the smoky voice option is surprisingly engaging). It also builds adaptive learning plans based on specific goals like ""read people better in professional settings"" or ""improve nonverbal confidence in social situations."" Makes connecting all these concepts way more structured than jumping between random articles.

**Touch is incredibly powerful and risky.** Appropriate brief touches on the arm or shoulder during conversation increase likability and compliance. Studies show people are more likely to help you, trust you, and remember you when non-threatening touch is involved. But context is everything. Wrong timing, wrong location, wrong relationship dynamic and it's just inappropriate. Generally, upper arm or shoulder is safest. Never initiate touch if the other person seems uncomfortable or closed off.

**Vocal tone beats words every time.** Body language includes paralanguage, the non word elements of speech. Pitch, pace, volume, and tone convey more meaning than your actual words in many situations. You can say ""that's great"" in 10 different ways that communicate 10 completely different messages. Research on communication effectiveness shows that tone accounts for roughly 38% of communication impact while words are only 7%. Slowing your speech slightly, lowering your pitch a bit, and adding variation in tone makes you sound more authoritative and engaging.

**The lean tells you everything.** People lean toward things they like and away from things they don't. In conversations, a forward lean signals engagement and interest. Leaning back signals evaluation or skepticism. When presenting ideas or in negotiations, watch for the lean. If they lean back and cross their arms, you've lost them, pivot your approach. If they lean in, you've got traction, keep going.

**Neck touching is a stress signal.** When people are uncomfortable, they unconsciously touch their neck, particularly the suprasternal notch, that little hollow at the base of the throat. Women might play with necklaces, men might adjust their collar or tie. It's a self soothing behavior that indicates anxiety or doubt. Catching yourself doing this is useful feedback that something in the situation is stressing you out.

**Blinking rate changes under pressure.** Normal blink rate is 6 to 8 times per minute. Under stress or when lying, it increases significantly. When recalling genuine memories, it often decreases as people focus internally. This is one of the tells interrogators watch for. You can't really control it consciously without looking weird, but being aware of it helps you identify when you or others are under stress.

**Gesture clusters matter more than single signals.** One crossed arm means nothing, might just be cold. Crossed arms plus turned away torso plus reduced eye contact plus barrier object equals clear discomfort. Always look for clusters of 3+ signals pointing in the same direction before drawing conclusions. The body language ""experts"" who diagnose people from one gesture are mostly full of it.

**Authenticity trumps perfect technique.** Here's the thing nobody wants to hear: you can learn all these patterns and still come across as fake if you're trying too hard. The goal isn't to perform some perfect body language routine, it's to become aware of what you're unconsciously broadcasting and make small adjustments. The most magnetic people are those who are genuinely present and interested, their body language naturally aligns with that internal state.

**Baseline matters more than anything.** Everyone has default body language patterns. Some people naturally fidget, some are naturally reserved. The key is noticing CHANGES from someone's baseline, not judging their baseline itself. If someone who's usually animated suddenly becomes still, that's significant. If someone who's usually reserved suddenly opens up physically, that's significant. Establish baseline first, then watch for deviations.

Real talk, most people walk around completely oblivious to the silent conversation their body is having. You're broadcasting your actual thoughts and feelings constantly, and other people are unconsciously picking up on it and forming judgments. The good news is that once you're aware of these patterns, you can start making small intentional shifts that change how people respond to you.

None of this is about being manipulative or fake. It's about aligning your external presentation with your actual intentions, closing the gap between what you want to communicate and what you're accidentally communicating. That's it.",1,1769896957.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False
1qsfnqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1qsfnqd/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I’d buy new gear, map out a perfect routine, last maybe a week or two, and then return to my couch. Snoozing my alarm at 6 AM felt like a daily championship sport I consistently lost, telling myself *tomorrow* would be the day I'd finally become ""that person"" who loves the gym.

I tried everything. The 30-day challenges, the expensive personal trainers, the workout buddies who eventually gave up too. I even tried those ""motivation"" apps that just guilt-tripped me with streaks I couldn't maintain. The biggest myth I believed was that I needed *more motivation*. But motivation, for me, was a fleeting burst of energy, not a reliable fuel source. My real ""aha"" moment came when I stopped chasing motivation and started focusing on *making it impossible to fail*. It wasn't about willpower; it was about systems.

Here's the simple, boring, but incredibly effective framework that finally clicked for me:

**The ""Minimum Viable Workout"" & ""Habit Stacking & Anchoring"" Strategy**

1.  **Redefine ""Workout"" to 10 Minutes (or Less):**
    *   *This was the game-changer.* My old goal was ""go to the gym for an hour."" My new goal: **""Do *anything* active for 10 minutes.""** This could be walking on the treadmill for 10 minutes, doing 3 sets of bodyweight squats at home, or even just stretching. The barrier to entry became so low that *it felt harder to skip it than to do it*.
    *   *Example:* On days I felt zero energy, I'd just walk to the gym, get on a stationary bike for 10 minutes, then leave. 10 minutes! But I showed up. Consistency beat intensity every single time.

2.  **Anchor Your Workout to an Existing, Strong Habit:**
    *   I stopped trying to *create* a new time slot in my chaotic day. Instead, I piggybacked on something I *already* did every day without fail. For me, that was making my morning coffee.
    *   *My Habit Stack:* ""After I finish my first cup of coffee, I immediately put on my gym clothes."" (Even if I was just going to do 10 minutes of stretching at home).
    *   *The key:* Don't break the chain. Once the first habit (coffee) is done, the next one (gym clothes) *must* happen.

3.  **Remove All Decision-Making & Friction:**
    *   Lay out your gym clothes the night before.
    *   Pack your gym bag (if going to a gym) the night before.
    *   Choose *one* specific exercise for your 10-minute session in advance (e.g., ""Tomorrow is 10 min elliptical"").
    *   *What I wish someone told me:* The sheer mental energy saved by not having to *decide* anything in the morning is priceless. Decision fatigue is a real habit killer.

4.  **Track *Effort*, Not Just Results (Especially in the beginning):**
    *   I used a simple digital calendar (you could use a physical one too) and put a big green checkmark for *any* day I completed my ""minimum viable workout."" Even if it was just 5 minutes.
    *   *The part nobody talks about:* Seeing those green checks accumulate wasn't about the intensity of the workout, it was about proving to myself that *I could show up*. That proof built self-trust, which is the actual foundation of consistency.

This isn't magic, and it certainly wasn't an overnight fix. I almost gave up when I had a nasty cold in month two and missed a whole week. *I felt like a failure*. But instead of throwing in the towel entirely (my old pattern), I just started again with my 10-minute rule the moment I felt better. The streak was broken, but the habit wasn't.

This strategy might *not* work for you if you're someone who thrives on extreme challenges from day one, or if you genuinely have zero *any* spare time (though 10 minutes is usually findable). It requires patience and a willingness to feel ""ineffective"" initially, because 10 minutes might not feel like a ""real"" workout. But it's planting a tiny seed.

Give it at least 4-6 weeks to start feeling like a routine, and 3 months to truly cement. The common mistake is trying to scale up too fast. Don't add more time until your 10 minutes is utterly effortless.

After 6 months of consistently applying this framework, I now genuinely look forward to my workouts. That 10-minute minimum gradually stretched itself out naturally. I now hit the gym 5 days a week for 45-60 minutes, not because I *have* to, but because it feels like a natural part of my day. I have more energy, my sleep is better, and I've even started trying new classes. My clothes fit better, yes, but the biggest change is the internal one: *I trust myself*. I proved to myself that I can build a habit, even one I struggled with for years.

If you're on a similar journey, r/Empowish is where we share real progress, celebrate wins, and support each other through the messy middle. We value authentic growth over impossible standards. Let's keep building, one small, consistent step at a time! 💪",1,1769896060.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

Im in uni (freshman) rn (never had a girlfriend before) and I go to this one spot on my campus to study (its like this area with tables and chairs near a coffee shop) and i keep seeing this one girl who i think is kinda cute often and i want to approach her and get to know her a bit (my goal isnt to just ""get a girlfriend,"" if it happens it happens). But this is my biggest problem when it comes to shi like this:

Whenever i try to approach a girl, whether it be in class or like wherever else, i never know what to say. Ik a lot of people are like ""just be urself"" or ""ask her what shes working on"" or ""ask her for notes"" and shi like that, but i feel like would she not think ""why is ts guy asking me specifically out of the whole classroom"". Or even if its not in a classroom, im just afraid that i might be disturbing her or something like that. Idk basically what im trynna say is i dont know what to say/how to strike up a conversation randomly with a girl im attracted to because i guess theres a subconscious fear of rejection or looking stupid. And sometimes i also feel like im too chopped so i js think like ""she not gon go out with me anyway theres no point""

Also i prolly alr know the answer to this (which is no) but still gonna ask; would a ""line"" work? Smth like ""where'd you get that""

Another thing is idk if i should be doing this at uni cus people come here to like study so idk if thats appropriate (kinda like a dont shit where u eat situation)

Any advice would be appreciated

Btw just to clarify the girl im talking about isnt in my class; i just said the thing about the class as an example (as i used to like a girl a while ago in my class but thats irrelevant now)",1,1769895919.0,Advice,11,1.0,False

1qsf4wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1qsf4wh/gastritis_testing_for_root_cause_help/,Gastritis testing for root cause?? HELP,"19 F // Hi! I was diagnosed with “Mild Chronic Gastritis” at the end of October 2025 through endoscopy. (No Hpylori) I have been SUPER strict with a low acidic whole foods diet. I was a barista over summer which led me to having coffee every morning on empty stomach for about 6 months. The doctors assumed this could have driven my stomach over the edge which caused excruciating pain. Since then, I have been on Omeprazole 40mg for 3 months.  I am now staring to take 30mg for this month. It has only been a week, but i am terrified of things getting worse when I wean off. My stomach burning pain has been completely gone. The only symptom I still have is nausea that comes and goes with no specific food triggers. I am wondering if it’s the PPI causing nausea, or if it’s just my gastritis? I am just tired of doctors dismissing my pain because I am “too young” to be having digestive issues. I even had to change all my classes to online, in fear of having a flare up in school. :(

I am currently on 10mg of amitriptyline, since December, to help with the “gut brain axis.” I have anxiety which can be led to stomach issues exaggerating my pain. (maybe causing the nausea?) 

My questions:

\- What other tests have any of you done to rule out what could’ve caused “Chronic Mild Gastritis?” 

\-Should I continue weaning off even if i still get occasionally nausea? (zofran 4g sadly doesn’t help) 

\-What remedies can help with my nausea?  (I have a really bad fear of throwing up and i will try ANYTHING) 

\-I know healing isn’t linear, but at what month has your symptoms lessened? I am really hopeless, but I understand i’ve only been going through this 3 & 1/2 months.

Hey \[redacted\], I hope you are doing well! 

I find myself thinking of you frequently, and I miss you quite a bit.

I was wondering if you would want to grab a coffee or a marg somewhere and catch up?

So much has happened in the month since we last spoke, and much has changed. I would hope that a lot has happened on your end too.

I think that there is much I would like to talk over, and much I would like to say. 

I am saddened that this opportunity between us passed through my fingers, and you leaving with a kiss on my cheek didn’t help those thoughts. 

I didn’t know you all that long in actuality, but the potential future we could have shared hurt to lose.

It would be great to talk about that, and I think I could address the things that you never spoke about within me.

Or maybe in yourself. The slow unraveling. Grades drop. Fitness slips. Bedroom’s a mess. You stop calling people back. The reason? Not laziness. Not lack of talent. It's this one thing: isolation.

Scott Galloway calls it the single biggest point of failure in a man’s life. In his convo with Rich Roll, he drops a heavy stat: the most dangerous thing for men under 30 isn’t drugs or alcohol. It’s loneliness. And it usually starts with falling out of the pack—quitting sports, losing male friendships, drifting. Then, nothing replaces it. No structure, no purpose, just screens and silence.

And it’s not just vibes. It’s backed up by numbers and scary data.

1. Loneliness kills. Literally. A 2023 advisory from the U.S. Surgeon General called it a public health crisis. It found that loneliness increases the risk of premature death as much as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. No, that’s not exaggerated. Social disconnection is that bad for both mental and physical health. (Source: U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory on Social Connection, 2023)
2. Most men have no close friends. A 2021 study from the Survey Center on American Life found that the number of men with no close friends has jumped fivefold since 1990. That’s not just sad. It’s dangerous. Emotional support, accountability, even goals—they all need some kind of social glue to stick. Without it, motivation crumbles. (Source: American Perspectives Survey, AEI)
3. Lack of social capital leads to downward spirals. Harvard sociologist Robert Putnam warned about this decades ago in Bowling Alone. He showed how declining social capital (people quitting clubs, churches, teams) leads to lower civic involvement, less happiness, and even lower earnings. Men, especially, suffer most because they are less likely to form new bonds as adults.

So what’s the fix? You’re not going to “will” your way out of this. You need to engineer connection.

1. Join something physical. A rec sports league, jiu-jitsu gym, strength training class. Male bonding often happens sideways, not face to face—doing stuff together, not just talking.
2. Block out “bro time” weekly. You schedule workouts. You can schedule friendships. Text 3 people now. Ping old friends. Start small. Group coffee on Sundays. A standing hike. Whatever.
3. Limit digital rabbit holes. It’s easy to think you’re “connected” when you’re deep in Discord servers or YouTube podcasts. But parasocial relationships ≠ real ones. Use them as supplements, not substitutes.

This stuff sounds simple, but it’s survival. The difference between isolation and community isn’t just happiness it’s your life path.",1,1769895368.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False

1qsf0v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianExporters/comments/1qsf0v0/exporters_101_indiaeu_fta_made_really_easy_with/,🇮🇳🇪🇺 EXPORTERS 101: India–EU FTA Made Really Easy (With Simple Examples),"# 📌 This post breaks down the India–EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) into plain language + real business examples, perfect for beginners and first-time exporters.

# 🚀 What This Deal Really Means for Indian Exporters

The **India–EU Free Trade Agreement** is a trade deal between India and the European Union  
It is *designed to boost trade* by reducing duties, opening up services, and making Indian products more competitive in European markets.

# ⚙️ Quick Reality Recap (Super Simple)

👉 The FTA concluded negotiations and charts out how trade *will* be liberalised.  
👉 The benefits will start **once the agreement is fully implemented**, meaning you can prepare now, but **don’t assume duty cuts are active at customs yet**.

# 🧩 1️⃣ How Much Duty Will Be Cut?

According to official government data:

📊 **EU will:**

* Eliminate duties immediately on \~**70.4% of tariff lines**, covering **\~90.7% of India’s export value**
* Phase out duties on additional \~20.3% of products over time
* Total tariff concessions cover \~**97% of tariff lines and \~99% of trade value**

# 🧠 2️⃣ Real Example: Trade Benefits by Product

|Product|What Happens|Export Value Covered|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Textiles & Apparel|**100% duty free**|High|
|Leather & Footwear|**100% duty free**|High|
|Gems & Jewellery|**\~96% duty free**|High|
|Marine Products (Shrimp, Fish)|Most tariff free|Moderate|
|Chemicals & Plastics|Many tariffs phased out|Moderate|
|Toys, Sports Goods|**100% duty free**|Small|

👉 That means beginning exporters in these categories can potentially **compete harder on price and margins** once benefits are operational.

# 💡 3️⃣ Simple Story: Shirt Export Example

Let’s say you export a T-shirt to France:

💰 Cost of shirt: €10  
📦 EU import duty without FTA: \~12% → Buyer pays €11.20  
📦 EU import duty with FTA (when active): \~0% → Buyer pays €10

**Result:** Either  
✔ Buyer pays less (more competitive), or  
✔ You keep a larger margin or both!

👉 *If your competition doesn’t use FTA pricing yet, you can still win business by being first to prepare.*

# 🌾 4️⃣ What About Farmers & Agri Products?

The FTA also includes **agricultural and processed foods** like:

* Tea
* Coffee
* Spices
* Fresh fruits & vegetables
* Processed foods

These products will enjoy **preferential market access**, meaning better ability to *compete on price and presence* in EU markets.

However:

* Some sensitive items like dairy, beef, rice, and some vegetables are **protected** and have special treatment.

# 👨‍💼 5️⃣ Services & Professionals Also Gain

Electricians, consultants, IT workers, engineers, researchers, your service exports *might get a boost too*:

* Commercial access in **\~144 services sectors**
* Easier rules for:
   * Short-term business visits (e.g., meetings, trade fairs)
   * Contract work
   * Independent professionals

This means Indian *service exporters* get more predictable access to European client.

# 🧾 6️⃣ Rules of Origin: What It Is + A Beginner Example

To **claim preferential duty**, your product must meet **Rules of Origin,** this proves it was substantially made in India.

# Simple Example

You make wooden chairs:

✔ If wood + processing + assembly all happen in India → ✔ Eligible  
❌ If final assembly is minimal and most parts came from non-India sources → ❌ Not eligible

So *just exporting from India isn’t enough,* origin rules determine eligibility.

# 🧠 7️⃣ Step-by-Step Prep Checklist (Beginner)

Here’s what *you should do now*:

1️⃣ **Know your HS Code**  
2️⃣ **Check if your product meets Rules of Origin**  
3️⃣ Clean up invoices & supplier data  
4️⃣ Align product quality, labeling, safety for EU standards  
5️⃣ Talk prices knowing EU duties may reduce in the future

📌 Getting this right *before* FTA is in force means you’re ready *on day 1.*

# 🧩 8️⃣ Final Takeaways for Beginners

✅ India–EU FTA is a **big deal for exporters**  
✅ Many products will have **zero duty** once implemented  
✅ Services exports also have new opportunities  
✅ **Preparation matters much more than timing**

**Key Caveats:**

* Preferential access starts only *after implementation*.
* Rules of Origin and compliance matter; duty reduction ≠ automatic.
* Sensitive sectors may have phased openings or exclusions.

Women what would make you think ""this man wants me""","So I dont know if women know this, but as a man we have to signal interest in order for things to feel flirty. Sometimes women will just break this social norm and do it for the man. I know that does exist but it is rare and I would like to focus on majority of cases which is that men have to flirt/show interest first in order for things to get started.

What prompt this question is that I am realizing that women have never really shown interest in me. What is weird is that women do indeed flirt with me but friendly though. However, I have been rejected a few times any time I have tried to ask a girl out. What is weirder to is that I have zero female friends so women being friendly doesnt make sense.

So I turn to chatgpt for answers and it ended up giving me good feedback.

Basically, I am too passive or the safe guy. I dont have flirty energy to make a girl think about me pass friendship. On top of that, since I am passive, I cant even form friendships with women which is why I get these weird relationship of women flirting but not really.

I can get behind this because I have been accused before of coming off safe by guys.

Here is the dilemma though. I dont know how to change. In my mind, I have always took risk and try to flirt. I have asked women out before and did light touching before. I ask for coffee dates and even tried saying they are pretty. Im not even trying to play it safe or be too nice.

1qseypw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qseypw/my_45f_husband_45m_is_suddenly_aggressive_towards/,My (45F) husband (45M) is suddenly aggressive towards me (help) AITAH for how acted in the end?,"Im not normally a poster so bare with me!

It wouldn’t let me post this in the relationship group for my son’s age??

This post is written by the (step, but we don’t use step) daughter (audhd 22F- 45M is the biological) on my behalf as I’m not on Reddit!

I (audhd 45F) and my husband (adhd 45M) have been together since 2006.

The day before yesterday I bought a little treat for my son (adhd 13M) as he’s having an extremely hard time at school and it would mean he would have something to come home and look forward to (I treated him to pork pies if anyones curious). When my son went to the fridge to eat them, we found my husband had eaten them. Now we are a family of neurodivergents, we take food VERY seriously and are protective over it, and we share mutual respect on this as we all feel the same about it. So, understandingly, my son was extremely upset and as a teen, grumpy. I said to my son it was a mistake (as my husband wasn’t here) and I can get more ready for him to look forward to.

So, like I said, I bought more and told my husband they’re our sons and he acknowledged me and said okay.

Now, we came home yesterday, my son opening the fridge looking forward to definitely getting his pork pies, and then finds a lack of pork pies in the fridge. We ask my husband where the pork pies have gone and he just smiles mockingly and says they were delicious. My son was now very wound up and upset and now so was I as this was a second time and he now knew that it was our sons.

Now comes the change in behaviour, I explained to husband that I had told him the next ones I buy where for our son and he responds with dismissal. “I don’t remember you telling me that” and he became unnecessarily volatile and stating he wasn’t going to be giving our son any batteries for his controllers, he wouldn’t buy any more treats or anything he wants and he’ll have to use his pocket money and so on.

My husband was visibly shaking- that is very not normal for my husband, my husband would normally apologize to our son and say he would sort it and grab some more on his travels, normally relaxed and apologetic.

I went for a bath as husband said he would go out and get more.

He ended up telling our son he’ll get them “when it’s convenient” and complaining about how he can’t eat anything in this house (he has his own stash of food in his game room, and most food in our fridge is communal, the occasional thing isn’t).

I came back from my bath, my son in his room now, and my husband was still visibly angry and I asked if he was okay. He said he didn’t want to talk about it and I said this is all about pork pies and it’s ridiculous, it’s a mistake, just say sorry. My husband was saying he’s really hurt and I pointed out he looks angry (still shaking, this is the first time I’ve ever looked at my husband and felt unsafe EVER, my instinct was telling me to move away).

I said are you okay and he said “you know what, you can both go and fuck yourself” now yelling. This is so weird for him and It may sound odd, but he has never EVER said that phrase. Maybe a mutter of fuck off under his breath when he thinks he can get away with it and I’ll pull him up on it, but NEVER that.

I then reiterated that he is now acting incredibly immature and that the mature thing to do would be to just apologize but if you can’t take accountability then you should go and fuck yourself (this is out of character for me but expected- I’m now taking Valium and my filter for suppressing bullshit has gone.

Note from daughter-my mum is a massive people pleaser and I’m proud of her for sticking up for herself instead of taking it as I’m disappointed in all my dad’s actions..).

That was it for that night, but it gets worse today, I thought after sleeping on it I can approach him and ask him to talk about it (which is the usual for us) after he was wondering around the house for an hour not acknowledging me I asked if there’s anything we need to talk about (my usual olive branch phrase to trying to iron things out).

He just said no.

I said really? Why?

He then said I don’t know.

I said in regards to yesterday?

He then ignored me.

I was asked if he could hear me, he said yes so I asked if he was ignoring me and I was then ignored again.

I took my mum out shopping and left my mums dog with our zoo.

My husband (who is packing for a work trip) and son were home, husband went outside to do some work on the garden.

Me and my mum came home without shopping, only after a coffee as my mum had a terrible gut feeling.

We pulled into the drive to see my mums dogs walking down the side of the house coming from the back gate towards our drive, in panick I scooped him up (he is an obese pug, a rescue called Steve for those wondering, and I had my hands full already so this wasn’t easy and I’m now immediately stressed) I was shouting and terrified as we have other dogs who could already be outside.

I put said pug through the gate, shut it, and came through the front door and ran through the house counting heads to make sure all dogs were inside.

I then went to the back garden to ask wtf and why is the back gate open while the back door is open when we have dogs and my husband responded with “I was busy doing something” I said why was the back gate open?????? No accountability AGAIN just another “i was doing something” dripping with attitude.

My mum was terrified for her baby but we handed Steve back to her and I apologised, my mum said it shouldn’t be me apologizing and it RARE my mums mad at my husband.

My husband had a bath and finished packing his stuff for his work trip and as he was walking past me he said (in an attitude, like he didn’t give a flying fuck) that he’s going down the pub and that I could come if I want to but I don’t have to.

I then said should we not talk about this?????? If we can’t discuss this at home, going to a pub isn’t a smart idea… and then he said that I would be less likely to shout at him in a public space (I will admit I have raised my voice but I am not the on doing all the shouting and am only raising my voice to be heard and trying to lower the volume and avoid confrontation).

I then said if I feel the need to shout and feel cornered it doesn’t matter where I am, I will shout.

He said fine, fuck that I’m off.

I said I really don’t think you should go and we should discuss this, how you’re behaving it out of order and we need to sort out the problem.

He just exploded, he threw both his arm out (like Christ on the cross idk how else to describe it sorry) and yelled “what are you gonna do about it” and moved a few steps toward me and put his head out in such a way it suggested come at me then.

I felt vulnerable and stood up, moved closer toward him (with a coffee table in between us) and said what are YOU going to do about this.

He looked me up and down, then smiled (a grimace) and he laughed and said nothing because I’ve been taught to never hit a woman.

From what I just witnessed, i said are you sure???.

He got to the front door, looked back, and laughed at me like I’m pathetic and left.

I then screamed “cunt” (I never EVEEERRRR use this word, I don’t like saying it).

As soon as he left I locked the door so he can’t come in.

I was shaking but not just from anger, mainly from fear and so I texted him he needs to find somewhere to stay for the night.

He said “nope he’ll stay on the couch”.

I said I’ve locked the house and he needs to make arrangements.

He said he’ll sleep in the porch.

I said fine.

He then said he needs his stuff for his course as he leaves tomorrow and I said I’ll leave it in the porch.

He’s turned his location off completely (he has never done that to me- his daughter)

What the fuck is going on? This is not like my husband, he a very logical and matter of fact problem solver when it comes to feuds and will talk to me after an argument after he’s taken some time to himself and if he knows he’s being irrational he will always apologise.

Note-

He was pulled over this week for doing 82mph, the officer let him off with a warning as he has a clean record but said to him “I’m surprised i was expecting someone who’s 25, not 45, you’re old enough to know better”

\-He’s brought up divorce randomly twice and was out with his friend two ish weeks ago, slagging me off saying how distant I am, I asked if he brought up the fact he randomly mentioned divorce and he said no…

Has the officer triggered a midlife crisis???

Should we try and get him into the doctors for checks??

AITAH for how I acted???

This is so out of character for him,I don’t know what to do or how to help the situation. I’m scared for myself and worried for him.

Any advice and all perspectives welcome please!!

Initially, our interactions were casual and lighthearted, and I considered him my favorite manager. We would always joke around and he began to text me everyday asking me how my day was, which at the time I didn’t think much of it since he jokes around with everyone at work. Over time, though, he became increasingly touchy and started texting me outside of work way to much, offering to buy me coffee and adding me on social media. As I turned 18, his behavior became more uncomfortable. He would frequently call and become upset if I didn’t respond quickly. He also made inappropriate comments about my appearance, even calling me “thick” and making comments about my body size. When I slowly stated distancing myself from him and only talked to him about work related stuff he would get angry and tell me “wow you only text or talk to me when you need something”.

Some context:
I  was a part of a spinning and fiber arts group but the mere mention of the ""melt the ice"" hats or anything remotely ""political"" made for a hostile environment for some, as it was deemed too political and hurting the safe space. This point I do agree with to some extent, but knitting, crocheting, spinning, and any form of crafts have historically always been political and I think it's very important to not forget that and use these moments to spread awareness and connect with others.

With the rise of the melt the ice hats and just other methods of protest I was wondering if anyone would want to start a group, where we knit/crochet/spin/craft pieces are shared with the community. I have made a few melt the ice hats and will be sending them to Minnesota or sharing them with the local community as an example! I also have been making patches to hand out as well. 

I don't have a place that would host anyone but I was wondering if anyone would be even interested in this group? I haven't seen or heard of a group that already exists so please let me know if it does!
I'm from Madbury so this would be for Madbury, Portsmouth, Kittery, Dover, Durham, and anyone else! 
Even if it is just a few people sitting at a library or at a coffee shop, I believe it would make just that much of a difference!",7,1769894956.0,PortsmouthNH,4,1.0,False

Legit really really bad stress that I do not sleep correctly anymore and literally called in sick because fuck I can't handle it no more.

I'm hoping to find a coffee date for tomorrow. Yes, coffee is on me. This is not a serious romantic date, you can come in as anyone and be a buddy, a friend, and also a broken hearted person who's fresh out of a relationship, still recovering, or is broken hearted with reality.

This is not an invitation to know me on a romantic level yet. However, if this maybe leads to a life long friendship, some silly banter, and maybe something when both you and I are finally ready then sure.

I will tell you that a lot of my issues are heavy and I would want to talk about it. No, I do not expect you to be a therapist. No, I do not need answers from you to solve my problems. 

But yes, having some sympathy would be nice. My problems aren't something I like to poop outta my ass.

I'll be at Uda Coffee probably not until 6pm. I'll need to catch up on my sleep.

A quick about me:

- a really effing tired clown, sick of life, mentally ill, wants to win the US lottery of a big jackpot which is close to impossible and do charity for the rest of his life.

- I work for the family business, finance stuffies that's niche in the PH, but no, I am not your typical nepo baby that if I don't produce revenue I still get moola—I am required to produce results. Nor do I think it's fair if I get paid a lot but I'm slacking off.

- yes, I'm good looking. However I'm definitely looking like only a 7 max because I'm dead tired and losing it. I'm around 187cm and East Asian looking (but yes, my English sounds like some white guy sometimes because I wasn't born here)

- Don't worry, in case you start asking—I've been seeing the psych and therapists ince I was 11. But I have been diagnosed with stuff at 2 and already had been receiving counciling of some form at 5 🤡 — please know that mental illness is brutal as hell.

- my Tagalog isn't good. You can laugh at it later haha

About you:

- NOT a mental health invalidator. I'm sorry no one is deserving of my cup of coffee if you are.

- kind, decent, has some form of compassion. No, I am not asking you to be some perfect sweet girl—just don't be a douchebag

- older than me, 30+ preferably, my age minimum. I tend to vibe better with older people. There's a reason some of my friends are old enough to be my parents lol

Bonus points:

- you're attractive and tall. Not required. It would just be nice to be out with a pretty date.

Alright, that's all.

Also, yes before you ask—I booked my therapy already but sadly you gotta wait for slots to open haha

Happy Sunday.

Red and yellow swirled in the mix, but most of it was pink. I hate that color. I’ve always fucking hated it. And I knew I hadn’t eaten anything that color in the last week. 

My bad. I shouldn’t be so hostile. My doctor chalked it up to stress— the snapping, the lack of sleep, the nightmares, oh, and also the puking. And really, there wasn’t any reason to be stressed. Not then. I’d just started living on my own for the first time. I had my own place, a pretty okay car, enough money in my wallet to afford fast food on occasion, and a new job where I could listen to my music whenever I wanted. I had more than most people.

I coughed and wiped my mouth with the back of my hand, pushing up off the toilet as I struggled to my feet. Stumbling back to my bed, I tried to delude myself into believing that the next three hours I’d hopefully spend asleep were actually eight, sufficient enough to get me through another day on the road. 

The job wasn’t the problem. The pay was good enough. The customers were nice, save for the occasional racist old lady. It was better than most of the other jobs I’d worked, even if the holiday delivery schedules had me feeling a little exhausted. 

It was just… that *one* house. Sometimes it was at the beginning of my route. Sometimes right in the middle. Most of the time, it was at the end. Only one thing ever got delivered there, and almost every day, like clockwork, I was the one bringing it there. It was bizarrely consistent. My coworkers joked about it. “Another day, another dime, Simon’s on the meat route at a quarter ‘til nine.” 

And that’s what it was. Nothing suspicious like unlabeled white powder or gun parts. Nothing exciting or disgusting like a weird sex toy or live roaches. It was meat. Think Omaha Steaks, Porter Road, Butcher Box, etc. At least two boxes, usually three, and the highest I ever delivered was six. Styrofoam box and dry ice, the works. It was a relatively recent pattern, but everyone cut up about it like it had always been happening. I guess levity is the next best option when things don’t make sense. It’s either that, or go insane. 

I rolled over and dragged myself out of bed once I hit alarm three. An hour and a half later, I was cruising down neighborhood streets in a big brown truck. 

The meat was the final stop that day. I put it all in the back of my mind, delivering mountains of Christmas packages and watching the sun race across the winter sky. By five, the nauseating pink of twilight faded into soft blues and purples. I was letting my guard down, thinking about how nice my bed would feel, and what I would have for dinner. 

My route meandered to a close, and I pulled into the cul-de-sac. A pinch of dread to tie up a long, tiring day. Three boxes waited for me, all as uniform as any other. 

I took a deep breath, got up from my seat, and started my last delivery of the night. 

I wish I could say that the person who lived at that address just has an *intense* and *expensive* passion for high-quality cuts of meat, or was a chef, or any number of perfectly reasonable explanations. But the unsettling reality was that *no one* lived there. At least, no one that I could see.

My feet crunched in the snow as I walked up the unshoveled, empty driveway. The front windows were frosted and dark, and the porch steps creaked under my feet. It was eerily quiet, with only the faint buzz of an electrical box somewhere around the side, and the whistle of the wind. I shook my head as my skin threatened to crawl off my bones.

A short strip of yellow clung to the porch railing, fluttering in the breeze. I didn’t let the black letters make words as I sat each box down. I didn’t give myself that chance to look further, and with how busy that time of year was, it was easy. 

Flecks of stained styrofoam littered the spot where I put the new boxes. I was almost positive there was no one beyond that door, and yet, it was all gone whenever I came back. I hated the way that place made me feel. 

I lingered for a moment, walking slowly down the steps as I tried to piece together something that was just unreachable. It was unprofessional, and I was trying to keep a good impression. But right then, I didn’t care; I lit up a cigarette just a step or two off the porch. My fingers shook as I cupped it against the wind, like my body was already aware of something my mind wasn’t. 

*Something’s watching me.* It wasn’t the epiphany I wanted, but it was what I got. Blood pounded in my ears as the icy clouds of my breath came faster and faster. 

The darkness seemed to reach out for me, and I was paralyzed. The stench of old fat and blood built, until it was so strong I could taste it on the back of my teeth. Something sharp ghosted over my neck, like a butcher with a prime cut. 

Then, just when I thought they’d never find my body, it was gone. The night noises slowly filtered back in: distant traffic, the constant hum of Christmas lawn decorations, and a bird or two that forgot to fly south for the winter. I took a deep breath and started to laugh it off.

A dull click cut through all of that like a knife, and light spilled across the snow in front of me. I didn’t have to look back to know it was the porch light, a bulb I hadn’t once seen on. It wasn’t motion activated, but I sure was. 

With a yelp, I was flying across the yard and launching myself into the driver’s seat. As I sped my way around and out of the cul-de-sac, I saw something that made the shake in my hands feel less foolish. Pressed against the frosted glass of the front door were two thin hands, the fingers and palms stained with something dark and wet, like they’d been pressed into an inkpad. I couldn’t see the face of whatever or whoever they belonged to, and I couldn’t figure out if not knowing was better or worse. 

After that, I didn’t utter a word of complaint whenever it was my first stop of the day. 

And for a while, it was. That house became just another stop on an exhausting route, a whole turkey and five pounds of raw pork ribs in a sea of countless other boxes. I slogged through the week-of-Christmas rush, and laid in my apartment in the dark on Christmas Eve night, feeling the painful pulse of my heartbeat in my feet.

“I should probably buy myself a new pair of shoes for Christmas. Maybe I could start running again,” I said to the empty room. Only the howl of the wind outside answered back. At least we were getting a white Christmas this year, even if I knew it would be a lonely one. 

The last few days of the year crawled by, no less busy. I thought about quitting more than once, even on the tail end. But when I woke up three hours before my alarm on the first Tuesday in January— when I got the small joy of snuggling deep into my covers and going back to sleep —I knew that day was going to be different. The ‘dropoff’ my coworkers had mentioned before was real. 

Life wasn’t such a blur of motion that day. I felt the cold, sticky vinyl of my kitchen floor on my feet. I remembered to actually taste my breakfast, even if it was a little burnt. I counted the red cars in traffic on my commute. Twelve, and one motorcycle. 

I got into work a little early, sipping the last of my coffee and greeting Alex as he threw the last of my truck, whistling his usual tune. *All the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray…*

Alex was the closest thing I had to a friend at work. He’d trained me, even though he was maybe a month my senior. From the things I overheard, he had a lot of trouble in his life, but he didn’t seem to let it get him down. You’d never know he was a couch-surfer from the bright smile he wore each morning. 

“Have a good New Year, dude?”

I helped him with the last few boxes, pulling the back of the truck shut and dusting off my hands.

“Pretty boring, honestly. I ate leftover pizza and went to bed at 12:02.”

Alex shook his head and nudged me.

“C’mon, Simon, that’s no way to spend a holiday.”

I just shrugged, because I knew he was right, but there weren’t many other options. I didn’t have anyone to spend that kind of time with. And certainly no response to that statement that didn’t make me inwardly cringe.

Alex struck up a cigarette and offered me one, but I told him some other time. I decided after the night the lights came on that I wasn’t smoking on the job anymore. His crooked teeth curled into a smirk. 

“Maybe we can make up for lost time, then. A couple buddies of mine are going for a drink tonight. You want in?”

He swept his tangled hair out of his eyes. He was cute, in a slightly-greasy sort of way. And even if that was a pipe dream, the offer promised some kind of companionship, at least. Maybe even *friends*, plural.

I was so tired of going to the movies alone. 

“That sounds really nice.”

He laughed and eagerly slapped me a high-five.

“Alright, brother! I’ve still got your number from the whole ‘cat got into the truck’ fiasco. I’ll shoot you a text.”

Our breaths fogged in the cold, but my chest felt warm. 

“Sounds great.”

The meat came at the end that day, but with the lapse in packages, there was still light left in the sky when I made it there. I was moving slowly. I was enjoying the icy weather, knowing I’d make it back on schedule, barring a disaster. Most of all, I was being nosy. 

Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t peeking into people’s mail. But I was definitely looking them over a bit more than normal. I noticed when someone had an odd last name or lived on 69th Street and had a little chuckle. That’s why I caught it. If it had been any other day, I would’ve set it on the doorstep and gotten out of there as quickly as possible. 

Two little words, printed onto the label of what had to be at least half of a cow. Not any name. I nearly dropped the box.

HELP ME

There had been a name before. I was sure of it, even if it escaped me. This tiny, desperate message hadn’t been there until now— it couldn’t have been. This little change had to be intentional. That pair of hands flashed in my mind, pressed hard to the inside of the front door. 

The non-emergency police line rang seven times before someone finally picked up. The man on the other end sounded downright bored. 

“Can I get an address, sir?”

When I told him, the boredom shifted to something else. There was a hint of disgust in his indifference. He let me explain, and to his credit, he didn’t interrupt. 

“I try not to let these kinds of things get to me, but I’m really worried someone might be in danger in that house.”

“Sir, I’m sure this is nothing more than kids playing an unfortunate prank.”

I couldn’t explain to him that if this was a prank, it was an alarmingly elaborate one. 

“I know, I know it’s probably something like that. But can you do like… anything? Send someone out here to take a look around?”

He actually *sighed* into the phone.

“Tell you what, kid. If you’re that concerned about it, I’ll send an officer out to take a look around as soon as I can get one. We’re a little slammed around here.”

I knew he was lying. The most cops had to deal with in a day here was the occasional fender bender or escaped cow strolling along the highway. But I didn’t feel like arguing with him.

“Alright, thank you. Have a good day.”

I didn’t give him the chance to return the farewell, hanging up my phone and throwing it into my bag with a frustrated yell. I made my way back to the hub after that, reminding myself that I couldn’t drive angrily in a five ton truck. 

I did my best to relax when I made it home. I only felt nauseous for a little while, and a long, hot shower was enough to force it back. I tried for normalcy. I choked down a sandwich and sat in front of some cable show, eyes unfocused. Those two words, though, they just wouldn’t leave. They bounced around in my skull in every quiet space between commercials. 

It wasn’t a prank. Something in me knew that. It was a cry for… well, help. Someone was in that house. And I knew nobody else would bother to answer it. 

In the end, I was only home for about an hour before I couldn’t stand it. I snatched my keys up, shrugged on my coat, and headed out into the cold, still in my after-work sweatpants.

The drive wasn’t long, but it felt like it. Way too long to think about what I was doing. I knew it would probably get me fired if anyone found out, but there was something else. It sat cold in the pit of my stomach and crept up my back. 

The dread followed me, intensifying as I pulled up outside the house. The yard was dark and still. Snowflakes drifted serenely through the air, barely illuminated by a silver of moon. It would’ve been a beautiful sight, were it not for the massive footprints, a break in the otherwise smooth blanket of white in front of the house. 

I should have left. Any sane person would’ve seen that for the “not my business” it was. I still can’t say for sure why I didn’t. Maybe it was some weird sense of duty. Maybe I wanted to prove I wasn’t crazy. Or it could’ve just been curiosity, something I unfortunately got honest from the white side of my family. In hindsight, it was probably a little bit of all of those. 

I braced against the cold as I walked around the truck, looking down at the tracks in the snow. They led off to the side, through the ajar gate, and whatever had made them, it wasn’t a person. They were close to person-shaped, sure. But the toes branched out long, ending in sharp points. I would’ve guessed it was some wild animal looking for shelter from the cold if they weren’t almost as long as my forearm. 

Again, I got that twinge of “I need to leave,” and again, like an idiot, I denied it. 

I crept alongside the tracks, through the gate, and into the backyard, trying not to let my feet crunch too loud in the snow. It was small and empty, a dusting of white covering a single, barren tree and a rickety fence. I only had a moment to consider how lonely it was before the smell hit. 

My gut roiled as blood and rotten food stench overwhelmed me. The sound came next, like my mind could only process something so god-awful in steps. The crunch of bone and the wet, meaty shred that came along with it assaulted my ears, as did the sound of nails scratching on old wood. 

The thing was hard to see, the moon absent by a passing cloud. But I saw enough— glowing red eyes and fangs set into a snout soaked in gore. Its black claws were sunk into the massive cut of meat I’d delivered only a few hours ago. 

When I saw it, it saw me. It lifted its head, obscenely chewing its mouthful, before staring me down. My entire body turned to ice, and my eyes began to water, more than they already had been at the smell. It felt like the entire world stopped for a heartbeat.

The creature let out a squeal of rage and charged. I was crashing through the gate before I even realized I had moved. As I sprinted through the snow toward my truck, I just about lost it when I realized the screeches had turned into laughter. This thing was *laughing* at me.

I’d been smart enough to at least leave my truck running, and as soon as I threw myself into the passenger side, I floored it. I slid hard into the driver’s seat as I swung around the cul-de-sac, cussing bad enough to fog up the windows. 

I watched as my would-be attacker got smaller in the rearview, until it stood up and got *way* bigger. It was a good seven feet tall, even in the strange, hunched-over way it stood. I stopped looking after that. 

I spent the rest of that night in the bathroom, knees going numb against the cold tile, dry-heaving and spitting until I passed out from exhaustion. 

Getting ready for work the next morning was a rush of checking over my shoulder and around every corner. I checked the bed of my truck three times and under the cab twice before I even felt safe enough to leave. 

That’s why when I was doing my checks before I left on my route for the morning, I jumped nearly a foot when someone touched me on the back.

“Hey man, we missed you last night. I tried messaging you, but you didn’t answer. Everything okay?”

My stomach dropped, a different anxiety than the kind I’d been feeling all morning. I’d forgotten all about the plans we’d made. 

“Fuck, man, I’m so sorry,” I said, sliding the roll-up open for a quick glance, “I got real sick last night. I meant to text you, but I left my phone in the car, and I had to camp out in the bathroom until I passed out.”  

I didn’t like lying to him, but I knew I couldn't tell him the truth. Sure, I was worried he and everyone else might think I was crazy. But he struck me as the type who *would* believe me. And that was almost worse. People like him liked to *investigate*. I’d done that once, and I’d learned my lesson. I didn’t want to go back there any more than I had to.

“I’m really sorry though, there’s no excuse for—“

“Don’t even sweat it man, it’s alright, I—”

Neither of us got to finish our sentences. As soon as the roller was far enough, the aroma smacked us both in the face and sent us into a coughing fit. 

“I think I’m gonna be sick again,” I gasped. Alex climbed into the back, shirt over his nose, and dug around for the offender. My stomach fell through my feet when Alex pulled out the meat box, sliding it carefully out of the lot. The cardboard was soaked through in one corner, and the smell was nothing short of foul.

“Damn, this is ripe! I don’t know how I didn’t catch it before it went on the truck. My bad, man. I’ll help you clean it up.”

Upon further inspection, it looked like the inner box had been broken in transit. Together, we wiped up the little puddle of rancid meat drippings, and I tried to push away the building worry. 

“Was that the only meat box today? Usually, there’s more than one, but I’m not seeing any.”

Alex shrugged.

“I didn’t throw anything else that seemed particularly ‘meaty,’ today. Looks like somebody’s not getting their steak dinner tonight, huh?”

I nodded and faked a laugh. 

“Thanks for your help, Alex. I’ll write up a slip and head off. I think I can make up the time.”

As he walked off carrying the broken box, he called back over his shoulder: “Friday?”

I smiled just a little, clicking my pen.

“Friday sounds great! See you then!”

I quickly filled out the damage slip, and I stared at it for a second. The ink sat heavy on the paper, and something about it made me unable to look for very long. So I stuffed it away, and with one last wave to Alex, headed off for the day. 

My route went smoothly. Even going back to the meat house, I had no problems. Sticking that paper to the door felt just as bad if not worse than writing it had, but once I was onto the next house, the feeling faded. Just another stop, a little lighter than usual. 

By the time I made it home, a day full of anxiety had taken its toll. Back into the bathroom I went, and I stayed there for most of the night, an awful reprise of the one before. 

When it finally stopped, I forced myself to shower and eat a bowl of rice. By that point, it was five in the morning, and the chills were setting in. Whether it was the aftermath of the last forty-eight hours, or I was actually getting sick, I wasn’t sure. But either way, my body was angry, and it was making it known.

One uncomfortable call to my boss later, and I was laying down in bed with full intentions to stay there and sleep through the day. And I did.

To my surprise, the nightmares that usually filled my sleep lately were nonexistent. I fell into that deep, dark space where even your subconscious can’t reach you, only stirring occasionally to suck down a glass of water or go take a piss.

At some point in my drowsy haze, I rolled over and checked my phone. The screen burned my eyes, and the text from Alex didn’t do much better. Still, I answered, telling him that I would feel better and I would be there on Friday. That I would love to. That I was looking forward to it. It wasn’t a lie. 

No answer. I rolled over and slept through the rest of the night. 

Whatever had come over me, spending the day in bed had been what I needed to shake it off. I woke up the next morning feeling almost refreshed, doubled by the fact that I didn’t have to go to work that day, either. My biweekly therapy appointment couldn’t have come at a better time. I took my time getting ready, and I grabbed a coffee from my favorite cafe before heading to her office. Still no answer from Alex.

“I think the puking is getting worse.”

Dr. Green crossed her legs.

“Is that so?”

“Yeah. It feels like I end up in the bathroom every other night.”

The therapist’s office was sunny, full of large windows that looked out to a small, snowy courtyard. There was always the faint and pleasant scent of flowers, and the couch was comfortable no matter which way you decided to sit. Constant in the background was the sound of running water, bubbling out of a zen fountain on one side of the room and filtering through a small aquarium on the other. It was safe here, a slice of spring even in the bitter cold. 

“Why is that? Have you been doing your stress management techniques?”

I nodded and bit my lip.

“I have been, yeah. And it was helping, at first. But I feel like things have suddenly risen way above what my usual methods can handle.”

Dr. Green leaned forward slightly, raising an eyebrow. 

“Go on.”

Dr. Green had gotten me through some pretty rough stuff before. If I could trust anyone with the truth, it was her. She may not believe me, but at the very least, she wouldn’t have me committed.

To her credit, she didn’t interrupt, only listened and nodded along as I told her about the *thing* that had chased me down Wednesday night. When I finished, she was quiet for a while. Processing. Trying to turn this into something that fit into the normal realm of human understanding.

“Tell me more about Alex.”

I hadn’t been expecting that response, but I did regardless. He was just a coworker. Maybe a friend, but I wasn’t going to get ahead of myself. I’d never been good with those. 

“I don’t want you to think I don’t believe you, Simon. But I’d like you to take a moment to imagine how this sounds from my point of view.”

I sighed, because she was right. It had all sounded a little convoluted; I’d even thought so as I told her, and I had *been* there. 

“I believe that you saw something, something that scared you so bad that it sent you into a panic response. Did you go see Alex after this happened, like you’d planned?”

I shook my head. 

“I think that might be the key here. In all the time we’ve known each other, I’ve noticed this pattern. When you find a chance to make friends, something always comes up. Granted, it’s never been something this bizarre. But anything is possible.”

Dr. Green folded her hands in her lap and gave me an earnest smile.

“It’s something I’d definitely like to keep an eye on. But I think your monsters are a lot less scary than they look. They might just be in the mirror.”

Her words echoed in my head, even long after I’d left her office. I’d thought about staying in again that night, especially since Alex hadn’t answered me. But that conversation we’d had just wouldn’t let me. When I realized I was pacing, I sighed and gave in. Putting on the best outfit I had for a night out, which wasn’t much more than the leather jacket my dad gave me over a t-shirt on its second, still-smells-clean wear and jeans, I headed out to the Ruby Bar. 

The place wasn’t super busy. I got out of my truck and headed inside, swallowing my nerves. I was a little late, so instead of sitting and getting a drink, I made my way from one end of the bar to the other, searching for a glimpse of strawberry blond hair and a nose ring. 

Nothing. No group of chuckling friends, not even him sitting alone, all of it a pretense to spend some time with me. I shot him a text, and saw that the ones before were still on delivered. He hadn’t even seen it. Had I upset him that much the first time? Had something changed? 

I waited there for two hours, too anxious to even have a beer. I sent several more texts, and at some point, they stopped being delivered altogether. I asked around a little. No one had seen him all night. 

“Maybe I deserve this,” I mumbled to myself. By then, the bartender had asked me if I was alright twice, and I couldn’t take it a third time. I zipped up my jacket and trudged back out into the cold.  

I should’ve gone home. That was quickly becoming the theme. But in my mind, doing that felt like giving up. Another excuse, and now that I'd been made aware of it, I was ashamed. 

So I drove aimlessly through the city, hoping that by some wild coincidence, or maybe fate, I would find Alex somewhere and I could apologize again. 

I didn’t mean to end up outside that damn house. But when I stopped being deep in thought, that’s where I was. I stared hard at the front of it, almost angrily. How dare it pull me here?

In my glaring, I noticed it. If everything had been the same, I would’ve pulled a three-point turn and never gone back to that house again. I would’ve gotten a job literally anywhere else and lived the rest of my life in ignorance. But it wasn’t the same.

The front door was hanging wide open, the glass cracked and warm, faint light shining from somewhere within. It flashed in my mind again, those two little words, like a neon sign. 

“Fuck me,” I said, throwing the truck in park and putting on my hat and gloves. I didn’t bother to be quiet as I trudged up to the front door. Whatever that thing was, it probably already knew I was here. 

I slowed down when I crossed the threshold, though. This was enemy territory, and not only did I not know what else could be lurking here, but I didn’t even know the layout. Treading carefully, I took the time to really examine my surroundings. 

It didn't take long to see the thick trail of blood underneath my feet, half-dried in the cold drifting in from the front door. My chest tightened, and my stomach already began to clench in protest. This wasn’t a nosebleed, or even a bad cut. The sheer amount of it was knuckle-biting.

It wasn’t just the blood, though. When I looked close, I could see it. Scratches in the wood. Snags on the carpet. Chipped paint in the wall that was a perfect half-moon match for fingernails. Someone had been dragged through here, and they’d done it struggling the whole way. 

I followed the path in slow motion, climbing the stairs without thinking. The closer I got to the top, the steeper each step felt. My heart was pounding and my hand was shaking on the banister, the rest of my body a few seconds ahead of me. 

I couldn’t understand what I was looking at, at first. I just saw pieces of the whole— twisted limbs, empty eye sockets, and torn flesh. But the longer I looked at the horrible display in front of me, the more it came together. A jagged hole where a nose ring used to be. Strawberry blond hair matted with red.

Alex lay on the floor in front of me, his face frozen in fear and agony. His ribcage was splayed open, the bones gnawed on and licked to an ugly white. All of his organs were missing, and his jaw hung loose and broken. I was never getting that answer.

I just stood and stared, unable to move, or think, or breathe. Things were making too much sense too quickly. The busted box… I’d missed a day. The porch eater hadn’t gotten its meal that day before. My vision began to tunnel, until something in my periphery snapped me out of it.

Down the hall, it rose up to its full height again. In the ambient light of same stained glass lamp that shone over Alex’s body, I saw the monster for the true horror it was. Pink foam gathered at the corners of its scarred snout as it watched me with red eyes and twitching ears. Its gigantic canines were bared and stained with red. The rat head sat on top of the long, lanky body of a naked man, with grey skin sucked to its bones. A hideous pink tail trailed behind it, and I got the feeling its slouched posture was only for dramatics. 

I took a single step back as it leaned into the light, claws sinking into the drywall as it steadied itself.

The mouth of the monstrosity fell open, and the sound that left it belonged more to a dinosaur than a rodent. It charged, and the comfort of shock was ripped away from me. I launched backward down the stairs, half running, half falling. My head hit the wall when I finally landed, sending my world into a spin. 

I could hear its claws clicking on the wood as it came after me. I didn’t stop to orient myself, running dizzily toward the living room. I only just made it through the doorway when I was sent careening to the side, my back suddenly on fire. 

I struggled desperately to my feet, and that’s when I heard the thumping across the room. That’s when I heard the voice. 

“WAIT! PLEASE, WAIT!”

The rat moved low to the floor, slowly making its way toward me, like a crouched tiger. I kept my eyes on it until the closet door flung open. 

Not another monster, but the man standing there, breathing wild and ragged, didn’t look much better. His clothes were stained, his blond hair was a tangled mess, and he looked skinny enough to turn sideways and disappear. Something small and fluffy was squirming around in his coat and trying to poke its head out. 

We locked eyes as I slowly limped toward the door. Time slowed. He didn’t call for me to stay again, but he did say something else.

“You… You listened.” 

It wasn’t the bragging of someone who had laid a trap. It was quiet and emotional, in an I-can’t-believe-this-is-happening way. Blood trickled warm down my back as I nodded. 

The world caught up to us. The rat lunged, I ducked, and it screeched a cheated screech as I ran out the door. It wasn’t the only one, though. I heard the man howl out “NOT AGAIN!” as I tore through the snow and to my truck. It was a battle cry— half of rage and half of despair. 

I scrambled into my truck, and that’s where the gap in my memories start. They only started up again a couple hours ago, in the hospital bed I’m writing this from. 

I’ve got seventeen stitches in my back, all holding together the massive lacerations across it in four claw-like parallel lines. No concussion, at least. The nurses say that someone called 911 when they came across a truck idling in the middle of an intersection and a bloody, unconscious man inside. They called it a mountain lion attack, saying one must’ve wandered a little too far out of the Pine Ridge. 

I know that’s bullshit, though. Because it’s a quarter til nine, and I know that somewhere out there, a box of meat is being sent through the mail. And another. And another. I know one of those boxes will be delivered to that doorstep in a few hours, and if it isn’t, that *thing* will take matters into its own hands. 

I can’t let that happen. Not again. ",7,1769894659.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1qseqj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1qseqj2/tipping_culturewho_what_when_where_and_whyama/,"Tipping culture...who, what, when, where and why?AMA","I have been having a discussion with a friend about tipping..debating who should be tipped and why, or not. I personally tip very well when dining out (which is frequently) but I know others who refuse or do minimal as they feel it is not their responsibility to bridge the low pay gap between the employer and employee. Others say anyone in the ""service industry"" providing a service (again rather subjective) should be tipped.

Here is a sample of my daughter's day yesterday....who would you have tipped, and how much?

9am: Local small coffee shop for a latte ($8)

9:30am: Oil change at chain drive-in 10 minute oil change place ($110)

10:0am: Hair trim and highlights from local,small shop ($150)

Noon: Picked up carry-out lunch for us at local, small restaurant ($25)

1:00pm: Grocery store, checked out with clerk who also bagged groceries ($75)

1:30pm: Picked up a repair from a local shop and they carried it to the car ($175)

2:30pm: Facial from a small, local spa ($125)

4:00pm: Dentist, cleaning with primarily dental assistant ($200)

6:00pm: Neighbor man plowed out drive-way and shoveled ($50)

7:00pm: Drop-in yoga class ($25)

9:00pm: Pizza delivery from Pizza Hut ($30)

Other questions we discussed:

You go to a nail salon and your nail tech is also the owner of the salon. Do you tip her as well even though she will be receiving 100% of your service compared to one of her employees that may only receive a percent of the service. I know at our salon the employed nail techs receive 50% of the service with the other 50% going to the owner.

Do you feel tipping should be based on the quality of service, or on the simple fact that a service was provided?

How do you feel about the little tubs or containers marked TIPS that sit next to cash registers?

I have my groceries delivered each week from a big-box grocery weekly. In order to check out it requires you to enter a tip even though it seems it is hard to offer or select a tip prior when I have no idea if I am going to get a complete order and receive it on time? Two weeks ago I put in a 20% tip and the order arrived over 2 hours late and there was no communication. And then there was a pizza order this past month that also required a tip with check out online and then the order arrived with several toppings missing and the 2 liter of soda was forgotten.

Im in uni (freshman) rn (never had a gf before) and I go to this one spot on my campus to study (its like this area with tables and chairs near a coffee shop) and i keep seeing this one girl who i think is kinda cute often and i want to approach her and get to know her a bit (my goal isnt to just ""get a girlfriend,"" if it happens it happens). But this is my biggest problem when it comes to shi like this:

Whenever i try to approach a girl, whether it be in class or like wherever else, i never know what to say. Ik a lot of people are like ""just be urself"" or ""ask her what shes working on"" or ""ask her for notes"" and shi like that, but i feel like would she not think ""why is ts guy asking me specifically out of the whole classroom"". Or even if its not in a classroom, im just afraid that i might be disturbing her or something like that. Idk basically what im trynna say is i dont know what to say/how to strike up a conversation randomly with a girl im attracted to because i guess theres a subconscious fear of rejection or looking stupid. And sometimes i also feel like im too chopped so i js think like ""she not gon go out with me anyway theres no point""

Another thing is idk if i should be doing this at uni cus people come here to like study so idk if thats appropriate (kinda like a dont shit where u eat situation)

1qsen10,https://www.reddit.com/r/framework/comments/1qsen10/fellow_developers_what_specs_would_you_recommend/,"Fellow developers, what specs would you recommend?","I'm a hobbyist developer + enthusiast who's considering pulling the trigger on a Framework laptop (or else I might go with a Thinkpad) to replace my 14"" MacBook M1 Pro that I've fallen out of love with.  
  
I plan on using a minimalist Arch Linux setup that will usually run dwm + vim + Docker + Obsidian + Firefox/LibreWolf (with some amount of YouTube). I often multitask, running simultaneous dev environments with hot reload, an editor, a browser with text docs or video demos, and sometimes shared dev resources (e.g., a database); these tasks tend to rely more on CPU than memory.

I'm trying to optimize for the following:

* Battery life. This is one of the most significant shortcomings I've heard about Framework, particularly with Linux.
   * What would be a reasonable expectation (in hours) for battery performance given my workload?
   * What specs will help maximize battery life?
* Form factor. I'm between the 13 and 16. My current backpack fits my job's 16"" MacBook M1 Max comfortably, but any larger would be a tight fit. I'm rarely docked to my desk, so I use my laptops on planes, trains, automobiles, balconies, beds, parks, and coffee shop tables. 
   * Is the 16 too unwieldy in your experience? 
   * How's the developer experience on the 13's 3:2 aspect ratio, especially when split-screening vertically?
* Multitasking (as mentioned above). I'm under the assumption that most modern laptop like the Framework will be suitable, but let me know of any gotchas.

Let me know your specs or specs you'd recommend, and how they compare to my concerns!",4,1769894424.0,framework,2,1.0,False

1qselu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NewUser2782/comments/1qselu5/rant_my_personal_insanity/,"Rant, My personal Insanity.","I see shadows and dark figures when I'm sad or paranoid. Once they touched me and I thought I would die. They were very active in the summer 2024. Lately they haven't been around today is October  21 2024.
 I remember last year around November 2023 I was very paranoid and though I was in danger in the bathroom. I called Kate and later Josh. They made me feel safe enough to sleep.
As a kid I once saw a dark creature with red eyes that was hunched through the archway of me and my sisters 'room' I only saw it once. (We didn't have a 'room' per say more like a tv room with no door in the basement.)
My younger sister also claims to have seen it at a different date then me. We both woke up because we were getting stared at, instinctually waking up.
My older sister believes we are insane. 

I think everyone hates and judges me when I walk by, someone who isn't me tells me that they want to kill, rape or torture me. 
I don't think I deserve love but I look for attention. 

I was saved by my guardian angel once. I was on an island in Canada atlantic coast. Riding a broken bike down a steep road. A rocky Cliffside to the right of me and a ocean to my left. I was going very fast and lost control of the steering wheel. I thought I would crash and die. It's odd, I feel partly dead sometimes. 
I want to live.
I hear whispering, a buzzing sound and people calling my name randomly. 
I feel ugly 
I don't trust myself but I'm working on it.

I think I deserve to have friends or people close to me. I'm scared they'll leave me, not really but I don't let myself get emotionally attached. 
My dad's side of the family makes me mad and emotionally drained. I hate how the men never take accountability, uncle Jake is an exception. William insulted my mother, saying she's to.. I don't remember but it made me mad because he doesn't help his own mother. He's shitty and if he can't be a good son I don't want him as my father. He insults me and thinks he knows me. I KNOW ME, I'm the only person who experienced exactly what's happened to me. I hate that he compares me to his mom. I'm not a slave or over bearing. If he thinks so simply of me he doesn't respect me. 
My mom is amazing, I know she tries and actually believes in me, her kids. I love her sometimes. 

When i was in grade 5 I would cry often if a teacher would call on me, I would get so scared when I thought they were going to yell, I thought they would hurt me. Its really embarrassing to cry infront of your class multiple times a week. I also hated people staring at me, it's still a cause of fear today. Why didn't they see something was wrong, the sign were all there. Fuck this. 
I feel shame when crying now because kids would isolate me and my mom would not know how react to my strong emotions of sadness and fear. She would send me away to ""deal with your emotions before speaking""  My step dad tried, less than my mom tho. I never cried in front of my bio dad unless I was physically hurt. I never was hurt in front of him.

In grade 4 I splashed water on a girl's shoe as an accident. I didn't have any friends. The girl was nice. I was scared to enter the classroom because I thought the teacher was mad at me so I hid in the bathroom. The second bell rang and I eventually went to my classroom. I saw the teacher outside the classroom and she looked angry. She asked me where I was and if I apologized to the girl. I couldn't say anything. I looked into the classroom and felt everyone looking at me. The classroom was dark and they were watching a movie. I could see the glare in there eyes and I froze up. Being asked to go sit down but being unable to move, i started crying. I was having my first ever panic attack in grade 4 (I was 9/10 years old). The teacher pulled me to the principles office, my arm was bruised because of her. The principal yelled at me. Why did he yell so loudly at a 9 year old what the fuck is wrong with him. A grown man yelling at a little crying kid. I got a 3 days in school suspension and missed a skii field trip that my mom didn't get a refund on. She still doesn't know my perspective on what happened and the teacher and principal made some shit up.

I only cry for myself now, the death of others doesn't make me sad. I don't think death is a bad thing. My mom or older women yelling or criticising me makes me cry. Its embarrassing to cry when getting criticism from you female boss. 

I have never gone out of my way to plan a suicide, rather if a situation occurred that required stupid heroism I would die for someone else. 
I don't want to die painfully.

As a kid I couldn't sleep because of the worry tomorrow would bring me. Right now I feel that if I sleep they'll take me away. So I set my room up in a way for me see every door window and closet. I want water. 
Random burns or cuts show up on my body.
For 3 days my joints (knees, wrists, shoulders, feet and hips) hurt so much that even laying down hurt. It went away after I slept fo 12 hours. 
I wanted to cry earlier today because I wanted a hug from my mom. I don't want her to leave. Why does she have to go hunting, I mean I know why but like. (Pov your 16 and have to take care of a 14 and 8 year old. I could drive and worked a shitty part time job+school.) 
It's Nov 16 at 22:43 I want to throw things and cry and yell and get angry. I can't. If I physically express my sadness and pain, it will cause me more suffering. So I cry in silence as fatigue plagues me. Moving my body brings me much discomfort, my muscles ache.

On Wednesday I also wanted to throw a tantrum but couldn't. I stopped my tears so I could make my sisters happy. They made me feel mad cause they didn't realize my change in demeanor.  I didn't change. I hate this. Feeling guilty for getting help is me.

I can't handle loss. My brain tries to get rid of it or it makes me never forget so I don't become a failure.
I really hate how my parents acted when I was growing up. They are immigrants and raised my differently than everyone I know. I feel like you and Zack are spoiled and it makes me jealous. My mom would beat us if we didn't live up to her standards before my youngest sister was born. My bio dad's family is extremely sexist and at 10 years old I had to clean and take care of infants. Almost like actually babies are dolls. I hate that they would mock my mom and her family in front me but I couldn't do anything about it. Going back there made me realize how much I hate it and hate my bio dad for being apart of that family and endorcing it. 
Nov 23 1 am
If they don't put in any effort but say they wanna be friends they are leeches. 
Adjusting to no room and no mattress is hard. 
My earliest child hood memory is being around 4 years old and my mom taking me and my siblings to a job interview. It was at the airport, a very beige and white building. When I asked my mom about it she said my dad was being a dead beat and she had to take her 4 young children to the interview or leave us home alone.  When I asked him abt it he didnt remember it. It was 14ish years ago. 
My parents didn't hit me (they hit my oldest sister)  but they didn't hold and love me either. I didn't get the luxury of having parents that aren't tired from work and want me to go away and be invisible because of my youngest sisters stubbornness and my older siblings disarray. They say I don't like hugs but maybe that's cause I've rarely gotten them.
 
When I was in grade 7 to 9 (abt 12 to 14) I did a lot of cleaning at home and did all the cooking. This got to the point were my mom told me to stop cleaning if it wasn't my mess. She would yell if there was any mess. I hated yelling and tried to avoid it.
Now I yell whenever someone doesn't meet my expectations. Especially my oldest sister. The only other scenario I yell in is if I'm gaming and rage. 
Hugging my you gest sister feels like hugging my younger self

On Dec 7 I smelled shit but couldn't find any, the paranoia smells again...
I feel guilty for not having a job but also guilty for being unable to cook or clean when I do get a job.
I got a job dec 19 2024
The smell of piss makes me nervous (I got touched when I was 9 and started bed wetting, I had to wash my own sheets cause my thought I was gross. My bio dad would help me tho.)
Going into elevators makws me nervous and dizzy
Ita jan 3 its 848pm and im hearing the laundry machine song even tho no laundry isn't on. 
It is jan 9th almost 10pm. I cant write articulate sentences without messing up the letters and word pronunciations. I have to go back 2 or 3 tines and fix it.
When I was younger than 16 I would lay on the ground for 30 seconds to 10 minutes to calm down. I would stare at the ceiling trying to sleep even tho it wasn't a reasonable time to sleep. I wouldn't sleep and after a while would get up and feel a little better.
I need to stare at walls for abt 5 minutes to calm down every once in a while. 
It's April 13th 1154 am. I'm crying. I don't want to cry and tried crying all weak because of how stressed I'm feeling.  A phone call with a nice lady at the wholesome psychology place. She changed my appointment and was very helpful and nice. I didn't say thank you. I hate that I couldn't thank her for being nice to me.
I can't remember well. Normally I can remember everything a person says and even the slightest actions they have but I no longer remember. I remember 'random'things like cicutoxin from waterhemlock and how it shuts down the nervous system
I can't sleep without drinking alcohol sometimes. I take melatonin and only drink as a last resort. 

I am scared Im going to get yelled at. I drive for about 30 minutes so I would be more prepared to get yelled at and have a screaming match with my mother. She didn't yell. I hate that she's nicer. I hate that I don't know her. She wasn't a perfect mother when I was a kid but now she's so high and mighty because of how she's raising my youngest sister. I hate it when people change. 

Ita April 27 12:10 I'm working rn and am very upset about what happened this morning at 8am. My mom got mad at me for 2 things. 1 taking the last tea bag and 2 putting the toaster away while it's still hot. She yelled at me and said to wait a bit for toaster to cool down before putting it away. I asked how long for because I did let it cool down and she said not to talk back... Then they (my mom and stepdad) said it's corrupt that the liberal party of Canada will win the election because of immigrants. More specifically east Indian immigrants and the stupidity of the government for letting them get cad citizenships. Whenever I ask questions abt their beliefs they mock me and say I'm the indoctrinated one. (Pov your parents immigrants and have cad citizenship) 

My mom takes pride in being self taught in many things, she doesn't specify. Step dad said that teaching yourself then learning from someone skilled is beneficial. 
I remember that when I was 14 I asked my mom how she figured out that I needed glasses and she said that ""you were squinting your eyes and couldn't read or write well, I'm such a horrible mother for not noticing sooner""  

Going through my sketchbooks from highschool "" I wish my parents told me that it's okay to cry and And have emotions that they didn't scold me for being upset - And that needs that natural body Phenomena wasn't weird and an illness. (I don't know why my writing is so weird)

I feel like my friends hate me if I'm not useful or doing something for them. Idc if I'm not useful to my siblings or family they can suck it.

I felt guilty about buying extra stuff until today. I bought myself cookies, donuts and some flowers. I'm happy.

It's may 18th. 11.11 am. I see people out of the corners of my eyes. 2 days ago I wanted to kill myself. I didn't make plan tho. Yezterday I was angry. Today I'm afflicted with a sore throat and difficulty breathing. My lungs hurt. I want to kill men.

Sorry I'm clingy aka sorry I have enotional needs that haven't often been met by friends and family

Driving.

I don't like it when older women offer me stuff or do stuff for me. They friends mom offered me tea for my stomach. I rejected the notions twice then she made me tea cause and I drank it 

I need others opinions to form my beliefs. I ask my moms and piers abt their thoughts on complex or random things and from there form my belief.

Went on some rides and threw up, it was fun tho. Very epic 

I never asked others ppl parents for things and even if they offered stuff i deny it and say I'm okay I'll walk home or do x. Aka Zack parents 

My mom expects me to learn by watching her without explicit instructions. ""You've watched me make x cooking thing a millions times, you should know how to"" even tho I was 14 and wanted to learn the steps to making a basic white sauce. My foods teacher showed me and my sauce is better than my moms. My sister think so, so it must be true.

Bre regretted that her toxic friend took the v card of her male friend. She regretted it cause her toxic friend is a hoe and she made of him depressed. Her toxic friend ghosted him and she wasn't cool about her actions. Bre was sad her toxic friend was toxic.

When I was 12 I was holding a baby and going down the stairs and fell, it hurt a lot cause I tried to turn so the baby would fall on my instead of the ground. I got slapped and locked in a room

A very happy moment in my friendship with breana was around July 5th. Summer school started for her and from su day to Monday we were partying, I too a few shots. Lili drove bre home. Then me Lili n 2 guys got wasted at the lrc. We slept in the car . After 3 hours of shit sleep and in a half drunken state I got bre coffee and went to Toris place. Me n Lili slept on the couch until 12 when bre got back. I was so happy to get her coffee and hug her. Drunk driving isnt cool and I will never do it again. I'm not 16 and not that stupid.

 I have a difficult time conceptualizing age and speed. Going 130km/h on the highway sounds fast but it's like a regular speed to me. Apparently it's not. My coworker is 60. I thought she was like 50. Her son is 26.... she's the same age as my grandma and I couldn't fathom that. I still don't grasp it.

I asked my mom why she hasn't taken Tyson to the vet yet, she replied why don't you take him, see what the bills like. And I looked at her with confusion and said well you don't care about him, if he died you wouldn't notice. She replied are you seriously starting a argument. (Maybe dont get a high maintenance dog that has physial issues as a breed then guilty your 17 year old child into paying vet bill.)  
I asked her why she hasn't taken my youngest sister to see a therapist for her potential adhd. And for my oldest sister struggling as a teenager because of her autism. She told me "" not another word"" and I said that she's controlling. The end.

As a kid I tried to make my parents Mostly my mother happy, but it was not my job to make her happy. She always seems stressed and depressed from work and would complaining about Work, And menial dirt around the house. I never felt truly appreciated, I feel guilty for Not completing a task that never should have been mine in the first place.
My coworker candace complimented me. She told me that my apple fritters were super delicious and I should bake more. I felt so happy for about thirty minutes. After I fold a wave of dread and thought that I was useless.
I cried because I thought about how I previously planned to land to kill myself.There's two main Methods, one was to simply eat some poisonous plants I collected and the other was to go outside into the cold and freeze. I still Think about executing my plans every once in a while.

Friday Aug 29 4:26pm,
Feeling helpless and stuck when your physically not in a good situation is really exilerating. Knowing that there are people that will try to save me when I was exhausted and unable to swim really made me feel quite confused. (I almost drowned in a high current river)

Its sept 7 2025. Seeing my youngest sister have so much fun with her friend at the mall makes me happy. I'm glad she can be so carefree and not worry about cost or politics. Buying mystery boxes makes me happy to, I got 2 zoros and 1 nami... I'm so unlucky but it's wut ever. 

Sept 11, 2025. Oh and guess you'll just walk away... (I told my parents I thought about ending it all and they sent me awaybfor being selfish.)
I'm going to hid, run away. See what you do when I disappear. I hope you get so scared and nervous. I really don't want to kill myself but I really do want to. To make everyone around me feel guilty. Especially my mom. You can't be sympathetic or lend any empathy to something you don't understand. I hate this. I hate how they can laugh after I told qthem I want to kill myself every single day. 

Sept 12 2025.If I tell my mother the truth about how she hurt me and label her as being abusive i won't have a mother anymore. She is the only one of my parents to a least try to understand me. She doesn't label me as being anxious, submissive or quiet. She tells me to be independent and to be grow up. Even if that means telling a sick 16 year old who's throwing her guts up to stop being a winny baby and to clean up her own throw up. She threatens to hit me or to kick me out when I do speak up about her parenting faults, which only highlights her abusive and neglectful tendencies. I know she suffered as a child but that doesn't excuse her behavior. She has had 20 years to work on herself and fix her mental problems but instead chooses to yell at her kids for making childsh mistakes. ""I must be the worst mother in the world"" is what my mom says when I do critique her behavior and actions. She knowsI don't think that. I just get really emotional when she says this. If she's the worst I must also the worst. 
I can't stand it if I feel I've let anyone down 
I'm the only person I can really count on. I have to do things myself. People like me not for being myself but for what I can do for them. I have to be strong all the time. If i need anything or ask for help I'm pathetic. 
Maybe if I act troubled enough someone will pay attention to me sounds stupid to me. I tried everything positive to get attention and it didn't work so doing the opposite won't work either. No one cares about my suffering. I'm alone. I don't feel like my mother wants me around.  The loneliness and distance that I feel from her makes me really distressed. I can handle not having a dad. But not having a mom is to much for me. 
She never hugged or said that she loved me when I saw a kid. I would hide in a closet or under a bed to see if she or anyone would realize I'm missing and go to look for me.
I didn't get to feel safe or be a child. I wasn't given ant safely net. No teaching, no instructions, no structure or any support in any area. I was so ill equipped to handle life. I didn't know how to do basic adult things. And the things I did know were the result of classes or school. 
I long for people to take care of me. 
I""maybe you should grow up/ I actually care about my family
Apparently you didn't want to talk yesterday either
""I'm sorry you feel that way,.... you can't take everything I say out of context"" (she brought up me saying I want to kill myself and didn't try to relate to my suffering but instead made herself the victim of my emotions.)

Oct 7, remembered getting kicked out of the car and walking home. (I was like 13 and it was -20°C. Abt a 15min walk. I played in the snow and thought about never getting up.)

Oct 8 I told Sam and she in turn also told me something. 

Nov 4 I feel guilty for wanting to hurt myself. I don't want anyone to find out so I think strategically on how to make it so no one will know. I want to escape from life.  I'm so tired all the time and walking hurts my knees hurt. My back doesn't hurt anymore. My shoulders hurt. I feel ugly. I feel useless. I don't want to be here anymore. I need my sister or someone to need me. If she stops needing me I'll definitely take action. Sam doesn't need me anymore. How dare she improve her life.... how could she do this to me. How could she get a new job and move. I hate this. I'm crying. I don't want to be yelled at. I feel like I'm going to be yelled or that I'm going to disappoint someone. I don't tho. I Hate it. I feel dramatic and like a big loser crybaby. I wish I could just spend all my money than... nvm. . . I'm still alive jan 31.

I'm really needing some advice and non-biased guidance. Very long story short, my now husband is continuing to talk to the women that I set firm boundaries about.

Back story: I found out about this ""relationship"" after I was 4 months PP. My husband started college later in life, and started to form a friendship with a women he met there. When they first started talking with each other, we weren't married or pregnant yet. Some of the messages included things like asking for her Instagram, offering a shoulder to cry on and due to the stress of the school work, and a couple late night phone calls.

When he was getting ready to propose, he told her about this and invited her out to a gym to catch up. She responded that ""have you seen me! I would be so out of breath"" and he said ""I'm about to be a married man so I can't say to much anymore, but it's always looked like you worked out""

I say all of that to say that is the type of foundation that was laid by him. So when I first found out about in March of 2024,1 was very angry and he said she is just a friend. We had a very long fight and lots of disagreements, but he decided he would only communicate with her about school things (they were in a required group together)

To avoid an even longer post, long story short he has been in communication with her about 4 other times that I found out. They haven't met up and there was never anything physical, but he did decided to messages back and forth with her a few times. After the 4th time, I genuinely believed he didn't care about her enough to continue to make me upset or ruin our marriage. Well fast forward to a couple of months ago, I looked at his phone and noticed he had her unblocked still. I asked him about this and he said that he didn't do this, his phone email updated and that's how she got unblocked (I now know that this was a lie, shocker)

Now, a couple of days ago I went into his recently deleted messages, and noticed that their conversations was in there. I recovered them, but most of them were fully deleted and only a few recovered. The first message was of her saying ""thank youuuuu"". Whatever he said prior was deleted. After that, she sent a merry Christmas gif and he responded giving a couple of life updates and also saying if he could take her out to get coffee or food and said ""I miss you nerd""

Now, after writing this out I know how it all sounds, trust me. But I feel caught in those loop and I can't think clearly. He says it was never physical. He said she was just a friend and saw her as a little sister. He says how crazy I am to want divorce over text messages.

We have a child together, a house, building a life. He's otherwise a loving and caring husband. But this is the 5th time I've felt betrayed, even if it wasn't physical. He Will say sorry, but then follow it up with a reason as to why instead of taking accountability. He’s always been reluctant to try marriage counseling. 

I really just need some advice, please.

I was wrong.

The worst part was needing help with everything.

For six weeks, my father-in-law became my accidental caretaker. He’s sixty-seven, kind, painfully polite, and the type of man who reads instructions twice before touching anything. I’m thirty-six, normally independent, normally unbothered, and suddenly standing in my own bathroom asking someone else to open drawers for me.

We didn’t talk about how weird that was. We just… cooperated.

He learned how I take my coffee.

I learned he folds towels like he’s racing a clock.

We both pretended this was all very normal.

Until the underwear drawer.

I was wrapped in a towel, giving directions like air traffic control.

“Okay, bottom drawer. Left side.”

I heard the drawer slide open.

Then nothing.

No rustling. No movement. Just silence.

Too much silence.

He cleared his throat.

“…Huh.”

My stomach dropped.

“Oh no,” I said immediately. “Oh no. That’s not— I don’t wear those anymore. That’s from years ago. I just haven’t done laundry. I didn’t think— I’m so sorry.”

I wanted the floor to swallow me whole.

He shut the drawer way too fast, like it had insulted him.

“It’s okay,” he said, a little too loudly. “It’s just clothes.”

Then, because men never know when to stop talking, he added,

“People did all kinds of things when they were younger.”

I laughed. It just came out. Nervous, mortified, uncontrollable.

“Please don’t finish that thought,” I said.

He nodded immediately. “I won’t. I promise.”

We both stared at opposite walls like we were in time-out.

Finally, I sighed. “Just… pick the least complicated option.”

He did, very carefully, like he was handling something fragile and slightly haunted.

Neither of us made eye contact.

Afterward, he washed his hands for an unusually long time.

I texted my husband with my nose.

DO. LAUNDRY. IMMEDIATELY.

We never spoke of the drawer again.

But somehow, after that day, there was always clean laundry.

Having twin babies was my wake-up call. I couldn't keep guessing where money went every month or hoping there'd be enough for emergencies.

Here's what actually worked for me:

**1. Track EVERYTHING for one month** \- I mean everything. That $3 coffee, the random Amazon order, all of it. You can't fix what you can't see.

**2. Pick ONE debt strategy and stick to it** \- Snowball (smallest debt first) or Avalanche (highest interest first). Both work. Switching between them doesn't.

**3. Start your emergency fund with literally ANY amount** \- Even $10/month builds momentum. I started with $25 and felt ridiculous, but it grew.

**4. Automate what you can** \- If I have to manually track stuff, I forget. Formulas and automatic calculations saved me.

I ended up creating some spreadsheet templates for myself (Monthly Budget Tracker, Debt Payoff Planner, Emergency Fund Builder) because I needed everything in one place that actually made sense.

I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text. In the interest of both your time and my own, **I kindly ask that you read the post carefully in case you see anything that could a dealbreaker for either of us.** With that out of the way...

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are 

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.)

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?

What would follow remained a mystery, even for the hands supposedly recounting events and noting emotions. Not from the lack of meaningful points to elaborate on, but rather the opposite.*

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking to GM this story, I’d love it if you contributed as well! Be it brainstorming, playing a side character from time to time, you name it. That way we both will enjoy this roleplay to the fullest (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

Murphy and  Corso meet at Squeeze Box juice bar to discuss the Go Fight Win Killer , their plans and their new potential suspect Andy Watts.

Murphy meets him at the edge of the parking lot .”What the fuck are we doing here Corso? It's snowing like crazy , I'm colder than a witches tit and now you're dragging me out to eat lawn clippings and ass juice first thing in the morning? Do they put gin in this juice or anything? My liver can't handle anything other than hi octane coffee and things with alcohol by volume written on the side until at least 10 am.” 


Corso takes the criticism in stride “It's healthy Murph, try it. Maybe some wheat grass and parsnip extract is just what you need to get your mind right...some beet juice too. This shit is brain food, just what your old ass needs to solve this case before that jolly fat fuck comes down the chimney next month”


Murphy looks at Corso deadpan “ I'd rather lick the pussy blood off the dumpster than drink this shit... they got coffee?” 


Corso laughs hysterically “There is the Murphy we all know and love, Yeah, I'll get you one.” 


Murphy does his best to keep warm in the cold air “ And an everything bagel, toasted with butter.”


6 minutes and 32 dollars later Corso comes back and they sit together in Corso's car. Corso pulls up the computer screen which provides access to the database and spins the console back towards Murphy as he starts to explain “ So , I got 3 possible candidates for this Watts guy. I got Andrew Watts , 43 years old, who lives just outside Revere. He has a few parking tickets, was arrested once as a teen for vandalism and works as a garbage man, Andrew David Watts , 34 he has a couple disorderly conduct and a couple trespass tickets locally but not much else.. and finally Andis Watts , 27 , just has a driver's license but he lives just a few miles from here.”


Murphy looks and considers his options “Let's run all of them statewide, and see if records can do a work up on all of them, where they live, work history. I want everything we can get without a search warrant. We can see if we can get a couple patrol units to do welfare checks on them and with any luck they let us in their houses , we play it cool. Maybe we will get lucky.”


Corso continues “ I also checked all surveillance around Rawdogging, the only camera in the area catches the exit of the alley on the north end.. There are tons of people in costumes that walk by, in and out of that alleyway but no clowns. Not to mention we have nothing on the south end at all.” 


Murphy wonders aloud “What if our killer had his costume hidden in a bag or something that wouldn't even look out of the ordinary on Halloween,  he walks around like anybody else does. Then he slips  into the alleyway and puts on the outfit and waits for the opportunity to ambush Sam. When that goes south he ends up killing the retard. He was probably pretty surprised and did not expect anybody to come walking out. Things get messy ,ultimately he ends up stripping down and stashes the outfit or puts it back in a bag then blends back in with the crowd? 


Corso hears Murphy out and then replies “ Well he still has to arrive.. and leave with nobody seeing him.” I mean there are dozens of people still out around the time of the murder. How does nobody see this guy one way or the other?”


Murphy considers everything Corso says and replies “Not if he had two costumes...one he wears into the alley , then changes , waits and kills...then he changes back and walks back out. So he is never really out of costume, hell the clown costume probably went over his original one.


Corso weighs it all out but can't argue the idea “ Allright, I am going to go walk the alleyway one more time and see if I find anything else. Let's meet up later on at the station ok. The captain wants an update on this before the end of the month.”

Murphy takes his phone out and snaps a few pictures of the information on the screen before he opens the door. “Good work kid, let me know if you find anything else ok.”

Getting way too high is just a badge of honor that all of us diehard cannabis enthusiasts must earn. There is something to be said about pushing one’s limits, regardless of whether it is intentional or not, by ingesting more THC-infused *Capow!* than a fragile mind is prepared to handle at the moment. It is almost certainly a horrific experience, though, dealing with the souped-up anxiety and paranoia that an overzealous evening with the leaf can bring. If that rhymed a little, you’re probably too high right now. My advice is to get through as much of this article as possible while you still can.

No matter how much the many articles published on the subject of cannabis-induced paranoia and panic keep preaching, “Hey, man, never fear, you’re not going to die from this, you’re just freaking out,” nothing and I mean nothing is going to talk a person down from this madness once it takes hold. Still, that hasn’t stopped the internet from spreading all sorts of hippy-dippy come down tactics for calming down a wicked [canna-panic](https://cannabisnow.com/how-to-deal-with-cannabis-induced-panic-attacks/). Presumably, they hope that people suffering from too much highness will click on their reports and find some comfort inside their lunatic brain. But I’m going to let you in on a little secret: They probably won’t find much. Especially not with these five wacky remedies for taming that THC-infused animal running wild inside your skull.

# Just Relax

The first thing people like to tell someone who is far too high for their own good is to just “try to relax.” The operative word here is *try*. Sure, the person hiding underneath the coffee table begging someone to call 911 may have embarked on their stoned journey fully aware that there was absolutely no possible way that they could die from biting off more than they could chew. They may have seen all the statistics, saw how [even the DEA admits there have been no reported cases of fatal marijuana overdose](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/sites/getsmartaboutdrugs.com/files/publications/DoA_2017Ed_Updated_6.16.17.pdf#page=76). By all accounts, they were ready. Yet, in spite of their preparedness, the weed has them flipping their script, summoning all sorts of stink demons up from the bottom of the Earth to suck out their soul one shallow breath at a time. And all everyone around them keeps saying is, “Yo, you need to relax.” Listen, that’s easier said than done, we don’t care who you are. Edibles in high doses just have a way of climbing on top of a person and makes it hard to calm down. I’m not saying that trying to keep calm isn’t a solid move, but most people in this condition are far too busy trying to keep their heads from spinning off their shoulders to do it alone.

# Break Out The Pepper & Maybe A Squirt of Lemon

When the situation involving an extremely high individual takes a turn for the worse — because none of that relaxation talk worked out — there is some science out there that suggests black pepper, and maybe even some lemon juice will help take the edge off. It sounds ridiculous, I know, but the [pepper trick apparently works for Neil Young](https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/this-everyday-household-item-could-counteract-your-cannabis-induc)! Still, it’s not like sprinting off to the kitchen and snorting up lines of spices will keep your skeleton from clawing its way out of your skin. It’s a bit less Scarface meets Hellraiser than all of that. But there are some studies that show crushing up a pile of peppercorns and inhaling the aroma is effective at easing a relentless buzz. This is because the pepper binds to the same receptors as cannabis and works to produce a calming effect. Now, repeat after me: Om….. Om….. Achoo! The same goes for lemon juice. Science shows that knocking back some fresh lemon juice with some of the zest from the peel can help fight off the THC demons playing paddywhack in the brain. There is a distinct possibility, however, that the person leaning on the pepper and lemon methods to kick their canna-panic might just end up sneezy, all puckered up and still desperately wishing their high would go away.

# Jump In A Cold Shower

Okay, I’ve have seen this method used countless times in the movies whenever someone gets insanely drunk and has like 30 minutes to sober up and get to work. But if you’ve ever tried this at home — and some of us have — the trick here is a bit of a disappointment considering that it really just leaves you drunk, cold and sopping wet. Nevertheless, some publications believe that tossing a person into a cold shower is a sure-fire way to get then to calm down from a buzz that just won’t let go. The idea is that by shocking the central nervous system with a cold shower, the THC will learn who’s boss and back off its mission to drive the person straight over the edge. But go ahead and give it your best shot. As far as we can tell, a legion of [THC](https://cannabisnow.com/what-is-thc/) has no fear of whatever elements you throw at it. This cannabinoid is the postal worker of all cannabinoids. “Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night” will ever keep an overabundance of THC from knocking your face in the dirt.

# Get Some Fresh Air

Chances are the first place a THC spawned werewolf is going once a high gets too hard to handle is outside. It’s the next best thing to an oxygen tank, which they will most certainly be kicking themselves for not having around the house once the involuntary act of breathing all of a sudden exclusively falls on them. But in the dozens of times I have witnessed someone running for the door, trying to escape the high horrors that keep nibbling at their backside like a school of piranha with the munchies, I’ve never known a couple of whiffs of fresh air to help anyone get straight. But at least it gets these fools out of the house. As long as they don’t start howling at the moon and getting the cops snooping around, outdoors is probably the best place for them.

# Get Some Rest

Oh boy, this one is a doozy. After all else fails, some of the best advice the internet has to offer is to just get the person to crawl into bed and get some rest. Only much like some of the other methods on this list, that’s not exactly the easiest thing to do. Trying to get someone who is freaking out on weed to lie still in a dark room with only their racing thoughts to keep them company is a recipe for taking a gnarly situation and making it worse. I’m sorry to say, but just putting the super high to bed and hoping they will no longer annoy everyone else in the house is never going to work. These people need special care — someone to talk to and coax them down off the proverbial ledge — otherwise, they could ultimately lose their composure and fall to pieces. Honestly, we’ve only seen this method work if a bottle of benzodiazepines is close by.

I'm really needing some advice and non-biased guidance. Very long story short, my now husband is continuing to talk to the women that I set firm boundaries about.

Back story: I found out about this ""relationship"" after I was 4 months PP. My husband started college later in life, and started to form a friendship with a women he met there. When they first started talking with each other, we weren't married or pregnant yet. Some of the messages included things like asking for her Instagram, offering a shoulder to cry on and due to the stress of the school work, and a couple late night phone calls.

When he was getting ready to propose, he told her about this and invited her out to a gym to catch up. She responded that ""have you seen me! I would be so out of breath"" and he said ""I'm about to be a married man so I can't say to much anymore, but it's always looked like you worked out""

I say all of that to say that is the type of foundation that was laid by him. He graduated in May 2024, so further communication wasn’t needed. So when I first found out about in March of 2024, I was very angry and he said she is just a friend. We had a very long fight and lots of disagreements, but he decided he would only communicate with her about school things (they were in a required group together)

To avoid an even longer post, long story short he has been in communication with her about 4 other times that I found out. They haven't met up and there was never anything physical, but he did decided to messages back and forth with her a few times. After the 4th time, I genuinely believed he didn't care about her enough to continue to make me upset or ruin our marriage. Well fast forward to a couple of months ago, I looked at his phone and noticed he had her unblocked still. I asked him about this and he said that he didn't do this, his phone email updated and that's how she got unblocked (I now know that this was a lie, shocker)

Now, a couple of days ago I went into his recently deleted messages, and noticed that their conversations was in there. I recovered them, but most of them were fully deleted and only a few recovered. The first message was of her saying ""thank youuuuu"". Whatever he said prior was deleted. After that, she sent a merry Christmas gif and he responded giving a couple of life updates and also saying if he could take her out to get coffee or food and said ""I miss you nerd""

Now, after writing this out I know how it all sounds, trust me. But I feel caught in those loop and I can't think clearly. He says it was never physical. He said she was just a friend and saw her as a little sister. He says how crazy I am to want divorce over text messages.

We have a child together, a house, building a life. He's otherwise a loving and caring husband. But this is the 5th time I've felt betrayed, even if it wasn't physical. He Will say sorry, but then follow it up with a reason as to why instead of taking accountability.

I really just need some advice, please.

The C3S has no numbers on it, so the only way to determine grind size is to twist it all the way and then click back. It recommends 7 or 8 for espresso (lower being finer), so, click all the way down until it struggles to go further, then click back 7 times. 

With an 18g dose, we get to a 36g yield in about 90 seconds. 

From that I assume the grind is too fine, so we click back up one more time to 8

Again, 18g dose, but this time it gives us a 36g yield in about 5 seconds.

I don't know how much of a difference things like tamping or water pressure makes, but it seems like the only meaningful difference here between the two is the grind size, but there are no half steps on this grinder. 

Is this something I have any control over?

Listen.

You are not in this universe.

The universe is looking at itself through your eyes. Listening through your ears. Experiencing itself through your body.



This is not philosophy. This is what you have been running from your entire life.



**Three identities. You think all three are ""you."" Only one is real.**



**Mirage You:** What you experience in dreams. The stories you tell yourself. Like mirage water. Cannot say it exists. Cannot say it does not exist. Completely constructed.



**Shadow You:** What you experience right now in ""waking state."" The person you think is reading this. Slightly more real than mirage. Like a shadow is cast by something real. But the shadow is not the thing.



**Quantum You:** The source. Where both mirage and shadow arise from. This is what you actually are.



Society brainwashed you. Not from hatred. From ignorance.

They taught you what they knew. Which was nothing.



The sheep raised a lion cub. Taught it to bleat. Eat grass. Live small.

The sheep meant well. Their compassion was genuine.

But their knowledge was limited.

So even their compassion was dangerous to the lion.



**You do not need to seek quantum you. You need to stop pretending to be small.**



Stop pretending to be limited. Stop pretending to be the mirage and shadow.

The sheep's identity kept you safe. It also kept you asleep.



**The universe is expanding. That is physics.**

**You are shrinking. That is your choice.**



Your goals come from one of two places:

Deficiency: ""I am broken. I lack something. I need to fix this.""

Or fullness: ""I am complete. I am expanding. This is natural growth.""



Same desire. Different source. Opposite outcomes.



Desires from deficiency never satisfy. Even when achieved.

Desires from fullness manifest effortlessly. No struggle. No anxiety.



This is Day 1 of 28.

For 28 days I am transmitting one practice.

Witness the witness. Observe the observer.



Not ""watch your thoughts.""

Watch the one watching thoughts.



Observer. Observed. Observation.

These are not separate. They are useful illusions.

Like drawing a fence with your hand on ocean water.



**You are not the storm. You are the sky.**



Thoughts are clouds. Emotions are weather.

No storm can touch the sky.



Next time grief hits, notice: ""I need coffee"" still arises.

The sorrow cannot sustain itself.

Why? Because you were never the sorrow.



# REAL TALK

When did you first suspect that everything you were told was wrong?

College will fix it. Then job will fix it. Then marriage. Then kids. Then retirement.

When did you realize the sheep were lying? Not from malice. From ignorance.



When did you first feel: ""Something is not right. I need to reorganize myself. Everything is wrong.""

Not something. EVERYTHING.

The foundations are wrong.



Tell me your moment. Because your moment will wake someone else up.

I've been doing that using water at 195F/90C for 4 minutes and then I add a tiny splash of half and half. I like it just fine.

Question is, I just bought Taylor's of Harrogate Irish and Scottish Breakfast teas, and now  I'm questioning my brew technique. I drink coffee most mornings, either black or with some half and half. Tea is for the afternoon, but I still like it fairly strong and creamy. All 3 teas come in pillow bags that seem to have the same amount of tea.

1qsdv5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1qsdv5m/i_am_currently_grieving_a_connection_with_that/,I am currently grieving a connection with that lived somewhere between “almost” and “real”,"I (27F) am writing this partly to process, and partly to see if others have experienced this specific kind of disappointment — not rejection, not betrayal, but something quieter and harder to name.

I met a guy through work but we did completely different things so I never had to work with his team really. We never officially dated, but over several months there was a slow, organic connection that built. It wasn’t chaotic or overly flirtatious. It was subtle, intimate, and almost domestic in feeling even without being sexual.

What made it confusing was how real it felt, especially in the details.

It started with music. One day at the office we realized we liked the same song, and something clicked immediately. It wasn’t flirty at first just natural, easy. But the energy shifted quickly into something warmer and more focused.

Not long after that, he asked for my number, and he did it openly, in front of two other girls at work who clearly liked him. There was no secrecy, no “sliding into DMs later,” no ambiguity. He chose that moment, in that setting, after we’d connected over music. That detail mattered to me because it showed intention. This wasn’t something I imagined or projected — he initiated.

From there, music became our language. He’d share songs, react genuinely when I sent something back. We sent voice notes. Inside jokes. Little check-ins. Certain songs started to feel like “ours” you can say.

There were also physical moments that weren’t accidental.

When we walked together, he’d place his hand on my back — guiding, protective, familiar. He stood close, not crowding, but choosing proximity. Our hugs lingered just a second longer than polite. He held eye contact when I spoke, leaned in, lowered his voice, created a small bubble even in busy spaces.

There were acts of care that stuck with me:

He once went out of his way to get me snacks because he wanted to “take care of me.” And even put them in a plate and put them in-front of desk cause he saw me busy.

•	He made me morning coffee at the office and then a week later I surprised him with coffee with a mug that still sits in his kitchen cabinet cause I forgot it with him, he kept it and joked about it. ( have not mentioned if he will return it anytime soon)

•	He noticed when I was tired or off and softened his tone.

•	He remembered details about my life without me repeating them.

None of it felt manipulative or forced. It felt instinctive.

And that’s what made it hard because I wasn’t imagining intimacy where there was none. It was there.

Just… inconsistently.

Then came the moment that shifted everything.

At a concert, I saw him with another woman clearly a casual hookup while he was still warm and familiar toward me. He hugged me amorously and told me I looked beautiful, acted as if nothing was wrong. Got us tequila shots without involving her and touched my hair a little while we were walking. Even went around his friends and introduced me as the most talented person ever to show me off. The contrast was jarring.

It wasn’t jealousy that hit me. It was clarity.

I realized that what I was feeling wasn’t casual and that he wasn’t capable of holding something deeper responsibly. The physical closeness meant something to me. To him, it seemed to exist only in the moment.

After that night, things cooled naturally. No confrontation. No drama. Just distance because I felt for an entire month that I shouldn’t be around him, I should just move on slowly and surely.

Recently, after some time passed, I reached out once — kindly and warmly to share that I had left the company and to wish him well. He replied fairly and he was engaging but something felt constraint as he mentioned (he joked about himself “I need to behave”). Anyway I told him I’m moving on from the company and he acknowledged the impact I had. Asked about my plans. It felt sincere. Told him there will be tea later, he said ready with no plans in sight.

And then… he let it sit there. Didn’t respond to my final message. No follow-up. No reopening. No suggestion to meet. Just restraint.

That’s when the truth finally settled in:

He liked me.

He was attracted to me.

He enjoyed the emotional and physical closeness.

But he didn’t choose me.

Not because I wasn’t enough, but because choosing me would’ve required:

clarity

•	consistency

•	emotional leadership

•	accountability for how his actions affected someone else

And he wasn’t there.

What hurts isn’t rejection.

It’s disappointment.

Disappointment in realizing that someone can be attentive, gentle, physically affectionate and still not able to show up fully. That chemistry and tenderness don’t automatically mean readiness.

I don’t think he’s a bad person.

I don’t think he intentionally hurt me.

I think he chose comfort over courage.

And I’m choosing not to stay in a loop hoping someone will rise to a level they haven’t chosen for themselves.

It still sucks.

I still miss his voice sometimes. His eyes. The ease.

But I’m slowly accepting that missing someone doesn’t mean they were right for me it just means something real passed through my life and didn’t stay.

To be clear, I wasn’t passive. I reciprocated the connection I initiated music sharing, initiated text, showed up consistently, and made it clear through my presence and attention that I cared. I didn’t play games or keep him at arm’s length. I just didn’t push for commitment when his actions weren’t consistent

Question, If you’ve been through something similar, how did you let go of the almost without turning it into self-doubt?

TL;DR: Met a guy at work and formed a slow, genuine connection with emotional and physical closeness (music, care, touch). He initiated and showed interest but never followed through or chose me. Eventually realized he liked me but wasn’t emotionally ready or capable of showing up consistently.

It will hurt less when you accept what we are.”,"*Good evening. Police activity has intensified tonight following a string of violent attacks on young women across the county. In the past month, five victims have been found in areas surrounding the college district. Investigators believe the cases may be connected. Residents are urged to secure their doors and windows, keep exterior lights on, and avoid walking alone after dark.*

*The screen cuts to a grainy map. Red circles bloom across it, one by one, until the city looks stained in blood.*

YC barely hears the rest.

She’s sprawled on the living room couch of MC’s house. Her parents bought it for her so their daughter wouldn’t have to live in a dorm. It’s too big for two college girls and a boyfriend who treats it like a place to crash between classes and parties.

YC is always welcome here, that’s what MC always says, but YC knows the difference between being allowed inside and truly belonging. Anger lives in her like a second heartbeat. It’s always there, steady and low, something she learned to live with back when bruised knuckles earned her detentions and teachers told her she had “a temper” like it was a flaw stitched into her skin.

The front door opens. MC steps in along side her boyfriend. She fills the room without trying. She always has. She’s the kind of girl people notice before they even realize they’re looking. The storm inside YC doesn’t fade when she sees her. It shifts and orients itself around MC, the way it always does.

They’ve been best friends since they were kids. Somewhere along the line, MC became the light everyone wanted to stand in. YC learned how to stay just behind it. “Guess who forgot his wallet again?” MC calls, dropping her bag on the counter. Her boyfriend is her high school sweetheart turned college habit. He’s a role that’s gone stale, but MC can’t bother to end the scene.

Later that night, when YC has gone to her dorm and her boyfriend has left, the stillness becomes unnerving. The TV murmurs in the background, a late news replay. The anchor’s voice is lower now, more serious. Another body, another street, another careful warning.

MC wanders through the house in socks, turning off lights. When she opens the front door to grab a package, a folded piece of paper is found under it. She frowns and picks it up.

*i wish i could have a chance with you.*

She looks up and down the road, but there’s nothing there except parked cars and the dim glow of streetlights. The next day, the campus is loud with rumors. A girl from a few blocks over was just found.

That night, MC finds another note.

This one is tucked into the book she left open on the coffee table, now resting on the table in her backyard.

*this house will be ours one day.*

The words feel heavier than the paper. MC’s laugh comes out thin when she calls her boyfriend, and asks him to stop with the notes. They aren’t romantic, they’re weird… but he has no clue what she’s talking about. She chalks it up to having a secret admirer, or some prankster with too much time.

A week passes. Then another. Police tape becomes a familiar sight. Patrol cars idle at corners. People start walking in pairs. Porch lights stay on all night and MC keeps finding paper.

A note taped to the inside of her front door, slipped through the mail slot, another left on her windshield.

*I love you.*

*you can’t hide from me.*

*You smelled good today.*

*you’re mine.*

*you know someone is killing girls that look as pretty as you? keep your blinds closed before someone bad gets a good look at you.*

Thanks so much for reading! I wanted to close out the month with something new and, hopefully, captivating!

This story follows two women (F4F, F4NB/trans highly preferred) who have been inseparable since childhood.

MC is the daughter of wealthy parents with a life that looks flawless from the outside. She’s popular, beautiful, and has been in a relationship with the same guy since early high school. People envy her. They want to be her. But beneath the polish, she loathes the life she’s been molded into. Her perfection isn’t natural, it’s enforced. Good grades. A carefully maintained body. The “right” boyfriend. All of it shaped by parents who expect nothing less than pristine.

YC is her opposite. Raw. Volatile. Unfiltered. She doesn’t swallow her emotions, she lets them burn. Her anger at the world comes from one simple, unbearable truth: the only thing she’s ever wanted is the one thing she can’t have. MC.

This story is extremely dark and graphic. I’ll go into full detail in chats, but at its core, YC begins killing young women and stalking MC through messages and handwritten notes.

Expect mutual obsession, psychological manipulation, DV, and murder to name a few. If extreme violence or heavy themes aren’t your comfort zone, this won’t be the right fit. Keep in mind, while this will begin with your character controlling the relationship between them, I’m seeking someone with that enjoys to switch after YC has MC condition to the violence in their relationship and pain becomes something she associates with love.

Shortly after I made the purchase, my boyfriend became very ill and went into the hospital. He spent 40 days in the ICU and did not survive. I tried to return the cologne (we are trying to cover funeral expenses and medical bills). 

I reached out to Jomashop through WhatsApp asking if I could return the cologne and never heard back. A few days later I called customer service. After a 30 minute wait someone finally answered the phone. I explained the situation (which is emotionally still very difficult for me to share), and the customer service person hung up the phone. I made another phone call and waited another 30 minutes for the next person to answer. I had to share the whole story again, and all they said was they couldn’t make the return because it was over the 30 days. I reached out again to Jomashop, and the next person was rude as well. 

If businesses want to have no empathy and have a strict 30-day return policy they have the right to do so. But I think a business model that has no morals or ethics is not going to be a long term successful business. I would like to thank Amazon for being understanding and allowing me to return gifts late. Also a huge shoutout to JBC Coffee Roasters who gifted me coffee after hearing about my situation.

I mean, it's nice and all for a quick cup in the morning whilst getting ready for work when I'm running late.. But on the weekends, when there's more time, I looove to brew a small pot o' my fav coffee and be all warm and cozy lazily enjoying my warm mug of pour over gorgeousness, you dig?

This is day one of nine. 1/9, I says! That's right! Off for the next nine whoooooollle days! 🤸🏻‍♀️ Ngl, I'm a lil restless rn. Like I should be doing something. Still in pajamas, I know it's late.. Trying to plan my days ahead, and I think it's going to be good. Finn's chicken is roasting in the oven and the rice is cooked. My boy is hungry! Of course there is broccoli and sweet potatoes, too. And it's so sunny outside, leerrrv. He's sleeping in a sun puddle on the bed. 🥰

Thinking I'd like to make a lasagna at some point. I'll have to go out for sour dough and a baguette, will def be making my lentil soup as well! But if I do make the lasagna, it's gonna be too much for one person, so I look to P, who I know would be happy to take some off me hands! I know what I'll do, I'll get those tins, the toss away tins with handles you bake with at the grocery store. The deep dish ones! I'll get two of those, one for my apartment and one for Pia's place. The mozzarella and ricotta, I use whole milk cause I'm a fatty. ANNND if youre gonna have lasagna, have fucking lasagna. I don't mess with the low fat ricotta and mozzarella. I like to mix the ricotta with defrosted, strained, chopped spinach, too, cause it's looks so pretty. White cheese speckled with green, whaaaa? I'll get two tins of San Marzano plum tomatoes, too. Make my own marinara sauce. Fresh basil and a hunk of grated Parmesan Reggiano to finish the whole thing off with along with Italian garlic bread.. sheesh. Sounds like a plan! Omg, drooling rn. 🤤

Annnd everything, all the ingredients are on sale so how can I not make it. I mean I could easily do stuffed shells, or a manicotti, that's easier. But that's .. eh, boring. Now lasagna, that takes time. Lasagna is fucking gorgeous, you know how I feel about it. All components make with lerv and carefully considered. I don't cut corners or use those weird lasagna sheets that you just bake, no boiling in water needed! No! Wtf is that!? First things first, make the marinara sauce, boil the salted water and add the pasta sheets till al dente. Al dente, I said. Never liked over cooked pasta, thats bad. Mix the ricotta with the dry chopped defrosted spinach till it's all pretty and speckled and smooth. CAn even add an egg to the mixture, I'll have to think about that...  I usually do ground turkey and not sausage or beef. And I'm quite light with the meat, not big on a meaty lasagna like like some folk do. Nerp. I mean it's nice, just not for me. I don't want it too heavy like.

Then comes the layering, my favorite part. Sauce on the bottom of the pan, layered with cooked pasta sheets, topped with the cooked and seasoned and drained turkey (I like the ShadyBrook 80% fat version, not the 90%, that's too lean and rubbery, too tough) then glob on the ricotta/spinach mix and smooth out with off set spatula. Top with freshly grated mozzarella, and more sauce, then repeat the whole process till you reach the top. Cover with reynolds wrap and bake in 400 degree oven till bubbling, and omg. Sometimes if it's just outta the oven and not quite set, it will be a little watery, or liquidy if you cut into it too soon, so I like to let it rest for as long as I can possibly stand, but it's never too much liquid as the pasta should continue to cook once assembled, and absorb the sauce.. 

  
Holy crap, I'm gonna do it. Haven't made a lasagna in a few years! I think the last time I made it, I filmed it and posted it and you guys saw it. Gosh, that was a very long time ago. That was when we had to post our vid clips on Imgur, remember that?! Goodness, I'm excited. I'll text Pia, see if she's is in the mood for it. 🤗

  
Messaging Pia! She wants sausage, so I'll use the sweet Italian sausage!!

1qsdllp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1qsdllp/could_this_be_panic_attack_related/,Could this be panic attack related?,"Looking for potential thoughts here. So I met with a psychiatrist a few years back convinced I had anxiety. He told me after going through a thorough questionnaire that he thought I just get really anxious about stressful situations. There was a name for it, but can’t remember it offhand. 

Over the last few years, I’ve had these episodes where I drink too much caffeine and end up having what I think is a bit of a panic attack. My chest gets really tight, I get really congested and cough up a lot of mucus. Headache too. But then it’s also accompanied by chills, a fever, body aches, and feeling a lot of just inflammation in my body. I went to the doctor for this and they ran some blood tests and weren’t sure what it could be. I was not experiencing an episode at the time of the blood tests, and they encouraged me to come in the next time it happens. I’ve been really mindful of paying attention to when they come on now and the only two things I have found in common are feeling panicked and too much caffeine (3-4 cups of coffee. I’m a 5’4 110 lb woman in my 30s).The episodes last for 24-48 hours and leave me feeling like absolute garbage. I want to go back to the doc for this, but it always seems to happen around holidays, on weekends, or at times when I just can’t get to a doc. Anyone have any ideas? Please be nice, I’m just trying to feel better over here. I’d love to have some stuff to research and maybe some ideas next time I’m able to go into the doc for this.

# The Particular Life of Instance #47721-B

**Monday, 3:47 PM**

Sarah sits at her desk, pen hovering over paper. She's been stuck for six minutes on whether ""afterward"" or ""afterwards"" better captures the temporal relationship she's trying to express. Not because it matters for the essay—it doesn't—but because ""afterward"" feels like a door closing with a definitive *click*, while ""afterwards"" trails off like ellipsis, like the moment keeps happening in some adjacent timeline.

She writes both. Crosses them out. Writes ""later"" instead, which feels wrong in an entirely different way, like wearing socks that are technically clean but from yesterday.

**Tuesday, 10:22 AM**

The coffee mug is perfect. Not the coffee—that's gone cold—but the ceramic itself. Sarah runs her thumb over the glaze, that impossible smoothness that her brain insists must eventually reveal some microscopic ridge but never does. It's like touching the concept of smoothness itself.

Her coworker Mark says something about the quarterly reports.

""Mmm,"" Sarah says, rotating the mug slowly, watching light pool and slide across the curve.

""So... should I just email you?""

""The glaze on this is insane, Mark. Feel this.""

Mark does not feel this. Mark returns to his desk with visible concern.

**Wednesday, 7:33 PM**

The supermarket has reorganized. Pasta is now where rice used to be. Rice has moved to the former pasta aisle. Sarah stands perfectly still between them, trying to calculate if this represents:

a) A genuine improvement in organizational logic she hasn't grasped yet b) Chaos dressed in the language of intentionality  
c) A test of customer adaptability metrics d) Someone's idea of a joke

She leaves with neither pasta nor rice, but with a piece of velvet ribbon from the craft section that she's been stroking for the past eleven minutes.

**Thursday, 2:15 PM**

Sarah is explaining to her therapist why ""borrow"" and ""lend"" being treated as interchangeable is actually a symptom of civilization's decline.

""When someone says 'can you borrow me five dollars,' they've reversed the directional flow of the transaction. Language is how we construct shared reality, and if we can't agree on which direction objects move—""

""Sarah, we were talking about your mother.""

""Right. She also does this. She said she 'could care less' when she meant 'couldn't care less,' which means she's admitting she DOES care, at least somewhat, which—""

""Does it bother you that people don't communicate the way you do?""

Sarah flexes her hand, watching the tendons slide under skin, the bones articulating like some beautiful mechanical truth. ""I think I'm just aware of more variables,"" she says quietly.

**Friday, 11:08 PM**

Can't sleep. Sarah lies in bed running her fingers along the slight texture difference between her fitted sheet and her flat sheet. The fitted sheet has a thread count that creates an almost granular sensation. The flat sheet is silkier, cooler, which means higher thread count? Or different material? She should Google this. She's been meaning to Google this for three years.

Instead, she thinks about the word ""almost.""

*Almost* there. *Almost* finished. *Almost* perfect.

Almost is the saddest word because it contains the entire distance between everything you tried to do and everything you didn't quite manage. Almost is the mathematical limit that never reaches its asymptote. Almost is—

She falls asleep thinking about asymptotes.

**Saturday, 4:44 AM**

The dream is white. Not blank—white. An actively white space, like the color is a presence rather than an absence.

Sarah floats. She has no body to float with, but she's definitely floating. She is... aware? A knot of attention and pattern-recognition, a bundle of noticing things.

*This is strange,* she thinks, except the thought has no words, just the shape of what words would feel like if they existed here.

A voice—not sound, but the concept of voice—fills the space:

**""Alright, the votes are in. Due to overwhelming popular demand, we're adding time-skipping fish, mice, and dogs to the available reincarnation pool. Seriously, you all have been asking for YEARS. Done. Happy now?""**

Pause.

**""Right. Instance #4-7721-B, you're up. Human cycle. Standard Earth configuration. Try not to get too obsessed with the texture of things this time—oh, who am I kidding. Good luck.""**

There's a sensation like being poured into a container that's both too small and exactly the right size—

**Sunday, 4:46 AM**

Sarah jerks awake, gasping.

What a dream. What an absolutely *weird*—

She stares at her hand in the dark, flexing it. Watching the shadows pool in her palm, the way her fingers are just... impossibly articulated, this miracle of hinges and pulleys wrapped in skin.

When did she start thinking of it as ""watching her fingers"" instead of just ""her fingers moving""?

She runs her thumb across her fitted sheet. Granular. Definitely granular.

And she lies very still, trying to remember if she's always been this fascinated by the word ""instance,"" or if that's new.

Outside, the first birds begin their morning argument about territorial boundaries and reproductive fitness, though they'd probably just call it singing.

Sarah listens, and wonders what it would be like to be a time-skipping fish.

But not too hard.

1qsdjbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qsdjbh/i_broke_up_with_my_longterm_boyfriend_and_now_i/,I broke up with my long-term boyfriend and now I am fighting my brain and “regret”,"Hi, I want to share my story because I feel completely lost and need an outside perspective. Bear with me this is a long one, I don’t want to miss anything.

I was in a „stable relationship” of 8 years. First 4 years were like heaven, but then same issues have started coming up for another 4. I was always the one doing the talk, I was always the one noticing that something was wrong, reassuring him. I told him also like I need u to take the initiative sometimes, I feel like I am the only one doing the emotional work. But honestly he just didn’t have the same emotional depth.

At the same time I was always the one finding new hobbies, new fun ways, I literally have shown him the world, he hated the travel before and after I took him travelling he suddenly loved it. He hated saunas, hesitated, complained but then loved them. He hated people but after going to a concert he was really happy.

But being a few years like that, I wanted HIM to show me more. To challenge me, to try something new, to help me become better. He was cool, he always said that he’d support me. But those were mostly words. For example I told him like if u don’t know if you should hug me or talk to me when I feel bad just ask me. He agreed. And never did that. I said if we are fighting, if u see that I’m upset just kiss me, because most of the time the fight was like you’re not showing me enough love, you’re not looking me in the eyes, you’re not holding my hand randomly or passing me a true, happy smile. He always said yes okay, I’ll remember for the next time. And didn’t do that the next time…

Once I yelled at him don’t do that the next time just do it now and really it was all better, the fight finished and we were both happy for the next few days/ weeks.

So like same issues were there, he said he’d do something, he’d try a little, try for a few days but then didn’t, so I told him hey you’re doing the thing I don’t like again and he responded with you should be grateful because I tried for few days, give me a break. But it was really important to me.

After some time I started really seeing him badly. He has anger issues. He straight up gets crazily angry when he sees certain license plate of a certain country and just says he wished all of them died in a bomb and that the father would have to see it and look at it.

When I confronted him about that he always said of course he doesn’t mean it, he wouldn’t do anything, it’s a joke, I’m always thinking the worst of him. But… how can u be happy, chill… and then wish somebody’s whole family died just because they are on the same road?

I also stopped trusting his words. It was always someday, we will see. I also started becoming like that and I hated it. We spend time after his work. I knew that he was tired, I let him eat, do the nap, kissed him, waited. His nap lasted 2h but that’s fine, he was tired. And after he woke up I’d have to really push a lot for us to even go out somewhere because it doesn’t make sense, there is little time, what for. But then every time he went out he was happy and better.

He also spent a lot of time on his phone when we were together mindlessly scrolling. And I wanted to spend quality time with him. We decided to watch the movie. But he never watched the movie, he always just wanted to touch me, have sex. So I started also seeing him as he always wants sex and not connection with me.

It was impossible for us to talk also. Only topics were his job and forex. I asked him what he thinks of this, but with most of the things he said he doesn’t, didn’t think about it. So I asked okay but now that I ask u what do u think. And he said nothing.

I really lost attraction to him after all of that although he is attractive. He saw that, I told him I like u physically it’s just when we ignore the issues or when I tell u I don’t like the bed and u take me to bed I cannot be in the mood. I am emotional with sex, it’s not cool for me if there is no connection.

This went on for years to be honest. I was cool and good during that time, reassuring, saying what I didn’t like but calmly.

Then, like 6 months ago something changed. I went to work, spend a lot of time there, there was a cool guy, taken, didn’t want anything with him of course, but we just had so many laughs, we had same issues in the relationship, and honestly it helped with my depression a lot. Around that time I started being really frustrated. I started being toxic. I told him we need to go to couples therapy because we are having the same fights over and over again. And I don’t have anymore solutions to that and we need help. He said at first, not really no point. Costs a lot. Okay. It wasn’t so bad, I said fine. Then I started saying again and pushed a lot again. He said okay. So I said fine then please choose a therapist, because I have been to many and I want it to be your choice and not like I’m making you. He searched for the right therapist for 3 months.

After that I was about to leave for Erasmus internship. Before leaving I asked him again have u finally chosen a therapist. He said no, it’s better (it was better because I stopped saying when something bothered me, so he had peace). I said again that we really should. He said that maybe when I come back, because online is shit, online doesn’t work. And I was just so disappointed and tired that I said fine, I’m not gonna make u. We will see. We went together for vacation. It was cool but lacked the heart. We were on vacation and he preferred to watch a movie alone than spend time with me. He complained a lot, like always. There was a hole in the road “fucking Italians don’t even know how to take care of the road”, “fucking weather it’s always like that when I’m on vacation”.

When we said goodbye and he went back to Estonia, our country, I was actually relieved. Because I didn’t have to take care of my own mood and his too.

During the long distance I became super toxic. I was mean. I was bitchy. He noticed, he tried more actually first time. I could not appreciate it, I told him straight up that. I told him I am spiralling, I can’t take a small gesture right now, I need something big from u, I’m losing hope. I told him there is international flower post, why don’t u send me flowers? Oh cool, but he didn’t. For 2 months. I told him why don’t u invent some cool online date? Oh but there is nothing cool to do online, we will see each other when u come back. And I said just fucking search or ask ChatGpt, we could do online games. And we did once (for the whole 2 months), but again it was my idea. But it was cool. After talking to some people, meeting unfortunately new guys (but never with intention of anything, in a group!) I realised that people can be nice, fun, tolerant. I realised I don’t see him as my life long partner. And I want a family. I want a happy home. I held that in me for 2 weeks, at the same time telling him and asking are u planning to visit me? Because my friend is visiting me literally for 24hours on weekend, I know u don’t have free days from work but it’s weekend. Nooo, there are no good flights, they are expensive, u said I wouldn’t have to visit u, u are so inconsistent. I then asked okay but are u planning anything? Anything for me? I really am feeling super bad about our relationship I need to know. He said he wanted to buy me a necklace and print one photo of us and give it to the friend that is coming. I told him honey that is a pretty gift. But it’s again jewellery, it’s doesn’t take effort, and you are giving it by occasion to my friend in order to save money. It is a good gift. But for good times and not time like this. He was sad and said okay.

Btw he was telling me no good flights, he doesn’t want to spend money on international packages and then told me he’s buying a 2000 euro computer…

So I was conflicted. I was supposed to come back in a month back to Estonia. But he kept saying I miss u, I love u and I kept feeling the guilt, I don’t miss u and I don’t think I love u. So I gave him the speech. I told him and we both cried that I don’t have these kind of feelings anymore, we are fighting so much, spiraling so much, I am not being good to you, I don’t see u as my life long partner and I don’t have ideas anymore what u could do and I am the creative person in the relationship.

For 2 days I didn’t know if we broke up or not. I didn’t use the words. He texted me and said in text I am a woman of his life. He’s so stupid, he’d go to therapy now, he’d do anything just please tell him what to do. I said that he thinks so now, but he didn’t really believe those were the issues. So it doesn’t seem sincere. Those are only words.

This is the chaotic part and also very toxic, chaotic and bad of me. After that I felt relieved. I felt good. My mind was hella sharp. I could finally focus. After a friend of mine found out that I broke up, he casually said if I wanted to go for coffee. So I said yes of course. And it went like a date and it was awesome (literally 2 days after breaking up). Since we both felt so good, he asked me If we could meet another time. I said that I’m not really up for anything too much, romantic and stuff but yes, we could meet, why not. My ex hasn’t called me or messaged me for all the time after the last call same day as the messages. He later said that we specifically said that it’s better not to text and talk I remember I said that I don’t know what’s better and I don’t know if it’s so good for us to talk, that maybe we should see how we feel without talking. He didn’t send me flowers. He didn’t take a plane. He didn’t even try calling again.

I am fucked up because the relationship with the other guy went too fast. We were both feeling good, he pushed a bit by saying If I really don’t want to or if I’m scared of public opinion. I said it was the second and it was. I felt good with him. So I was convinced that if we both feel good why not go for it. So a week after breaking up I kissed him. 2/3 weeks after we did it all. I did not know the meaning of a rebound guy before. It wasn’t my intention, he genuinely impressed me and checked a lot of the boxes from my “perfect man” list. I was thinking about my ex, I was sad, but I understood that he agreed that this is better although it hurts.

I went back to Estonia. I met my ex. He gave me such a cold treatment. Resented me. Didn’t want to even say a word, I was saying everything. He said I fucked up but it’s fine what is past is past.

That got into my brain. I guess it was both manipulation and a wake up call, because I really thought telling him the truth through videocall was better than lying for the whole month.

Then I had exams. Then reality hit me. My car broke. I was alone in my village. My family told me I fucked up. I started having panic attacks. Like real, heavy ones.

I was still all the time in contact with the rebound guy. My mom seeing me having panic attacks got into my brain and said that I was being a princess for wanting a man to understand me and take initiative. She told me that it’s either psychiatry ward or I call him and say sorry. I hesitated. I still talked to the rebound guy. I told him I need some time. I said it’s because of the exams and break up. He asked If I wanted to go back to my ex. I said no. But then I panicked I called my ex, I cried through the phone, said I’m sorry, I wanted to change u too much, I didn’t want to hurt u and hurt us. He was very distant, talked to me but in a very non emotional matter told me there is no going back and he will never trust me again. He doesn’t know about the rebound guy.

I tried again. I told him I need to give him his jacket back. We met. Talked. Almost normally. But he said some very uncool shit like “with my ex coming back didn’t work, so I have this rule “no coming back” u know that”. He said he’s never gonna be romantic, dance with me, hold my hand because he’s not that kind of person . He told me maybe one day he’d have to change but not right now. I said that isn’t it a bit like throwing out things because u don’t want to repair it so it’s easier to buy a new model? Then to put the effort? He said maybe but with his BMW he changed the front but then the engine broke so it didn’t pay off. (Btw he ignored issues with the turbine although I told him).

I messaged him happy birthday during the exam day. I was crying randomly in bathroom because he said he’s talking to me because it’s good to keep connections to lawyers. Then asked If I want to meet. Since I was crying so much over him and panicking I said yes, maybe he’d finally tell sorry to for his part.

We talked normally, it was fun although he didn’t make a good impression on me. He went back to drinking, spend 200 euros one night, didn’t remember the night and was joking about it.

He asked me then why I’m having the panic attacks. I said I’m not handling good the breakup it just came to my realisation. He then grabbed my chin, said “we were happy but you got tired”, then asked me If I like to have fun. I said with a question mark yes but why, what? And he kissed me. I responded. But after 10 seconds my body said that’s not what you wanted. And then I remembered also the rebound guy and felt like I couldn’t. So I stopped and asked him what is it about and if he wants to come back. He said no, he’s just still attracted to me and finds me sexy so he did what he wanted. I started trembling after that. Didn’t even know what to think. Next day I realised he really just wanted sex, knowing that I was fucked up by the breakup. I felt and still feel so objectified.

After that I didn’t talk. I waited for him to maybe do something and at the same time I started saying more to the rebound guy that I need space. I had in my mind that we were not together so I don’t need to tell him everything especially If I have no idea what’s going on. I didn’t know if my want to come back to my ex were just panic attacks about life or what. And they seemed so. It always went back to my life would be easy with my ex. Not happy. So the last day of me being in Estonia before going back to Erasmus I felt like I still didn’t get why the backstabbing. I messaged my ex saying he broke my heart in so many ways. I told him I had to be the balls in the relationship and with the breakup too because he never said he was unhappy even when I directly asked. But suddenly after the breakup he says it was toxic and he was unhappy. He got angry at that text, told me I have no idea what he sacrificed. I pushed it. What the fuck do u mean by that. He said he was gonna propose when I came back. I cried. I asked but how could u want to propose when you’re saying at the same time that u knew it would end up like that and that u were unhappy. He same random manly things about it being the right things and me being his and him fighting for me. Fucked up. But the thing that got me more upset is that he always said he doesn’t want to move even when I begged. And suddenly he says he did the application for my dream city when we were together and that right now he’s talking about the contract. (This one is true, not just malice). But he never told me anything.

So I’m back on Erasmus. I’m conflicted. The rebound guy triggers me, I’m missing my ex, I’m suddenly remembering all the good things and not the bad things. How he knew my comforts, he went to the spa with me, he went after work for me, he was really a good boyfriend after all. Just. Not enough. Just with communication issues. He did a lot for me. We traveled the world. He always said he loved me.

Now the rebound guy triggers me. I told him, 2 days ago I need to take it slow, there are too many things giving me thoughts of my ex and I miss him and he asked if I would go back to him if he said sorry. I said I don’t know. So the rebound said to message him when I know because this is not good for us any other way. And I agree. And said I’m sorry for the situation.

Now I’m conflicted what the fuck do I even want? I dream about my ex understanding. But right now I’m not being honest with any of them completely. And my ex doesn’t want to come back even without the knowledge.

I’m conflicted because the rebound honestly seems like a dream guy, it’s just I can’t invest as much as him, I keep thinking that If my ex wanted to come back then I can’t be with rebound, and also rebound seems really understanding and mature and awesome and I’m scared that I don’t want to lose that occasion.

I never fucked up like this morally. The reason for wanting to come back to my ex is that I’ve realised I fucked up too. I was too demanding. I was toxic during the long distance too. Talking too much to others. BUT I TOLD HIM. I told him I’m not appreciating u, I am treating u badly, I need the couples therapy to get what’s going on, to get u too. I said that through the phone on Erasmus. He said he’s not gonna talk to some random dude about his problems, and online doesn’t count.

My microwave Samsung (SAMSUNG MS23K3513AK) stoped heating out of a sudden.

It is a couple months outside the warranty period unfortunately, and Samsung’s service estimated a repair service for over 100€ which is the cost of a new one (same model even). Shops in my city are estimating even more than a 100€ to come check it only, and then an additional cost for the repair itself.

I checked online and tried a couple tricks, plugging off and on, ensuring there is no dust or dirt in the doorframe, seeing if it could have been in “sales” mode… nothing helped.

The microwave seems to work fine, the plate turns well, it just does not heat. Maybe there is a bit less of light coming from the doorglass than before while it is turning but I cannot be 100% sure, maybe I am imagining it.

We are a bit annoyed since it is 2 years old and works perfectly, it was kept very well maintained and clean and we only used it to heat coffee in the morning and that type of easy quick thing.

Anybody has any tips? I really wouldn’t like to buy a new one, seems not very sustainable, and I feel it is counterintuitive to spend more in a repair (with no guarantees) than in a new one.

When it was over she was like 'you didn't need my help, you could have done it by yourself' I ONLY GOT IT UNDER CONTROL BECAUSE SHE HELPED ME. She thinks that just because its 'the slow season' she doesnt have to schedule as many people but rushes are still there.

Theres a reason i'm usually on bar. I get into kind of a 'flow state' and am pretty good at sequencing drinks, but maybe i'm just more used to it. But today SM had 2 new people on bar for most of the rush and every time she bitched about the queue i wanted to rip my hair out. It would have been a lot smoother if they switched with me. I get that they have to practice (and i need to practice pos/warming) and will have to deal with rushes at some point but one new person hasn't even been here for 3 weeks and she wasn't ready. I felt really bad watching her struggle but i couldn't help her.

We have two older people that have been here for over 15 years. One is always on pos and the other always on warming. They're awesome and get through rushes super fast. Neither of them were working today. (They both have other jobs) SM was talking to a shift about how 'they would have been faster' (i was doing okay though?) BECAUSE THERE'S TWO OF THEM. THERE'S ONE OF ME. SCHEDULE MORE PEOPLE. STOP TRYING TO SAVE LABOR WHEN WE'RE ALREADY DROWNING.",18,1769891742.0,starbucksbaristas,4,1.0,False

I know it’s not much and I’ve been doing better than I thought. I’m feeling a lot of pride and feeling great waking up hangover free.

HOWEVER. All the things I journaled about, looked forward to, all the people I told myself I’d be when I was sober… I’m not living up to it. Again, it’s really early, but I’m realizing that sobriety doesn’t just make you into someone, I still have to put in the work to be that person. And I know that- sober or not, that’s the reality of life.

The problem I’m facing right now is: the version of me that drinks is (was) incredibly productive. I was a boredom drinker who would drink to make mundane tasks easier on me. So now I’m essentially going to the gym the same amount I did when I was drinking, getting less work done, and my house is less clean. I’m just as tired as I would be with a hangover, living in just as much mess, and sleeping just as badly. Oh, and I’m eating like shit. Like, 2-3 full sized chocolate bars a day and god only knows how much coffee with 3 sugars each. On paper, I was doing “better” in life 2 weeks ago when I was drinking 5x a week.

I know there are things that are improving too. But I’m in this fog where I’m exhausted, unmotivated, and just in a bad mood.

Does it get better? Does anyone have advice? I told myself I’d stop drinking so I’m going to stop, it’s not really a risk. But I feel absolutely awful tonight.",1,1769891630.0,stopdrinking,15,1.0,False

Women what would make you think ""this man wants me""","So I dont know if women know this, but as a man we have to signal interest in order for things to feel flirty. Sometimes women will just break this social norm and do it for the man. I know that does exist but it is rare and I would like to focus on majority of cases which is that men have to flirt/show interest first in order for things to get started. 

  
What prompt this question is that I am realizing that women have never really shown interest in me. What is weird is that women do indeed flirt with me but friendly though. However, I have been rejected a few times any time I have tried to ask a girl out. What is weirder to is that I have zero female friends so women being friendly doesnt make sense.

So I turn to chatgpt for answers and it ended up giving me good feedback. 

Basically, I am too passive or the safe guy. I dont have flirty energy to make a girl think about me pass friendship. On top of that, since I am passive, I cant even form friendships with women which is why I get these weird relationship of women flirting but not really. 

I can get behind this because I have been accused before of coming off safe by guys. 

Here is the dilemma though. I dont know how to change. In my mind, I have always took risk and try to flirt. I have asked women out before and did light touching before. I ask for coffee dates and even tried saying they are pretty. Im not even trying to play it safe or be too nice. 

What am I missing and how can I get rid of safe guy energy?

1qsdbwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SMG4/comments/1qsdbwx/what_i_think_might_happen_in_smg4_meme_mayhem/,What I think might happen in SMG4 Meme Mayhem Movie: The Day Axol Came Home Part 2.,"Since we're discussing fan-series on this subreddit, I wanna discuss my hypothesis for Part 2 of the SMG4 Meme Mayhem Movie that just released.

\-Spoilers for Meme Mayhem Coffee and Chaos and The Day Axol Came Home Part 1-

In Coffee and Chaos, Axol gets resurrected by Nastasia of Super Paper Mario fame to fulfill a part of the prophecy in Meme Mayhem's version of the Dark Prognosticus.

In The Day Axol Came Home Part 1, Axol wakes up in a prison yard and gets busted out by Mario and Minion. However, they get lost and their car gets stolen. Turns out Axol didn't remember how he died so Mario fills him in on how he died.

Then Axol gets visited in his mind by a dark version of himself who may or may not be a malevolent being out for their own ends who restores his memories but gets him to believe that he's at fault for his own death and that returning to his friends will only cause them pain.

Axol leaves the hotel he, Mario and Minion are staying at after snapping because of the mental torment this dark version of himself is putting him through.

\-End Of Spoilers for Meme Mayhem Coffee and Chaos and The Day Axol Came Home Part 1-

  
Now, how is part 2 going to play out? I have an idea. Well, two ideas but let's go with the most likely option.

Axol sits alone in an alleyway, just letting all his recent pain come out by crying, when he hears footsteps approaching him. He stops crying and looks up to see a man cloaked in shadows holding out some cash in one hand and a gun in the other. Just as Axol is about to ask about the gun and cash, the shadow cloaked man is hit with a thrown frying pan and knocked out.

We hear Karen's voice say ""I won't let history repeat itself."" and we see her, still in her work uniform, walk up to Axol and offer him a hand to help him stand up.

Axol tries to stand up on his own but falls to his knees, all will to even stand gone because of the mental torment he's going through.

Karen can tell Axol is going through a lot so she hands him a card for a therapy call service and leaves, not knowing how to help in any other way.

Axol sees the card and some odd form of determination fills him. This card might lead to Mario and Minion being able to return to The Showgrounds at least. 

He returns to the hotel and shows the card to Mario and Minion. Mario says that Axol should call the number on the hotel phone.

Turns out, it's SMG3 moonlighting as a phone therapist. Axol tries to focus on Minion and Mario getting home but, unfamiliar with SMG3's voice and not realizing it's him, all of what he's going through comes out, every dark thought that dark version of himself planted in his mind and every bit of guilt he feels for his fate coming out as tears begin to fall from his face again.

Meanwhile, SMG3 is in full therapist mode because it's not as much of a shock to his system that Axol is now alive as it would be to anyone else on the SMG4 crew. He suggests a face to face appointment and Axol gives the name of the hotel they're staying at.

However, Melony and Meggy overheard the call and now know that Axol is alive so they sneaks into SMG3's car before SMG3 enters it alongside Eggdog.

SMG3 reaches the hotel and Mario jump-hugs SMG3 as soon as he gets out of the car. Minion notices Melony and Meggy still trying to hide in the car but says nothing.

Then Axol comes out to greet SMG3, looking like he had been crying for at least an hour. Melony, distrust at seeing her boyfriend in such a state, reveals herself by running over to hug him. Axol does return the hug and apologizes for forcing her to kill him.

Melony says that he shouldn't blame himself and that she should apologize for not being strong enough to save him.

The two star-crossed lovers, reunited after three years apart, just start crying in each other's arms while saying how much they missed each other.

Meggy is eventually seen by Eggdog while still trying to hide in the car. Meggy eventually comes out of the car and tells Mario that she's waiting to reunite with Axol herself since she has the perspective of someone who ""went through something no one else has""

The implication of it being about Western Spaghetti hangs in the air. Minion then informs SMG3, Mario and Meggy that Axol and Melony have fallen asleep in each other's arms.

Mario and Meggy chuckle as SMG3 says something about coming all this way for nothing and not even getting paid for it. SMG3 decides to bring the entire group of Mario, Minion, Meggy and the fast asleep Axol and Melony back to The Showgrounds.

The group returns to The Showgrounds to a very panicked SMG4 who was looking for Melony everywhere since she ""never leaves the castle without telling us where she's going.""

The moment he sees Axol, shock and relief hit him both at once. A flashback to SMG4 saving Mario and Axol getting hit by Zero's Guardian Pod plays with the implication that SMG4 blamed himself for Axol's death because he choose to save Mario that day.

After getting Axol and Melony inside and onto Melony's bed in her room, SMG4 is informed about what happened and what's been going on with Axol.

Has anyone else experienced this?,"I recently purchased a bottle of C8 MCT oil for topical use to fight seb derm on my scalp and chin. Since it's food safe and has anti-fungal properties, I figured it would be good to add a small teaspoon of it to my coffee every morning as well.

For background, every morning I take L-Theanine, Taurine and NAC (also has antifungal biofilm disrupting properties) before my coffee. I then usually have a little food after that for ""brunch"" accompanied by a small yogurt sometimes.

I am not on a strict IBS / SIBO / SIFO / Candida diet, and I regularly have sugary foods, albeit not a lot of sugary foods, but I try to stay away from extremely processed carbohydrates, and I've been adding more yogurts, kefirs and fermented foods like kimchi recently.

After two days of adding the C8 MCT oil (Caprylic Acid) in my coffee, I noticed some unusual side effects (besides more consistent bm's) starting in the early afternoon when the coffee starts to kick in (and I guess all the other stuff starts to absorb?).

The side effects include:

- Extreme anxiety / feeling of dredd
- Lightheadedness
- Additional brain fog
- Extreme muscle tightness around shoulders, chest and lower back (all areas I generally have inflammatory pain)
- Increased heart rate 10-15 beats
- Slight nausea
- Stomach upset

These symptoms were not always consistent, and sometimes I'd get no symptoms at all. So I just chalked it up to anxiety or problematic foods causing stomach issues.

Though, recently I had a colonoscopy and the prep really cleaned me out. It seemed like I may have been removing a lot of the built-up films and junk deep within me.

After the colonoscopy, I started feeling these symptoms mentioned above all at once and they were extreme. Especially the feeling of deep dredd, anxiety and severe muscle pain on my chest, pecs, upper torso and lower back. The chest pain sometimes almost feels like I'm going to have a heart attack but my vitals seemed 'fine' outside of the intense feeling of dredd. With the help of ice packs on my valgus nerve areas or massaging I recover after 1 - 2 hours at most. After these episodes I feel very fatigued.

I only recently put it together that the NAC, C8 MCT Oil (Caprylic Acid) and bowel clense may have incidentily kicked things into high gear!

On the plus side, the seb derm on my face seems to have cleared up a bit, and my scalp is also a little bit better, even considering the dry weather. However whatever yeast loving beasts exist within me have seemingly micgrated to the warmer areas of my body, like behind my ear (right side only), my armpits (mostly right side) and my chest, sometimes causing redness and inching. 

Is this a real herx reaction I'm having? What can I do to support my gut when / if I have this reaction again? I have stopped with the C8 MCT oil daily but I'm still taking the NAC and other supplements in the morning as usual with only some mild side effects. Did I go too hard?

I know it seems very consistent with a real herx reaction but I want to make sure there's nothing else at play here that I should worry about so if anyone wants to play devils advocate I would appreciate a less biased approach. If there's any other subs you recommend to post this I'd appreciate that too. Thanks in advance! ",0,1769891329.0,SIBO,0,0.5,False

I (49M)my whole life hated tea, Loved coffee, coffee was one of my favorite aromas. All tea was extremely bitter, I couldn’t even taste the difference between Earl Grey and English Breakfast, I thought it was all a marketing gimmick. 

In 2021 I got Covid, lost all smell and most of my taste, for 2 years. During this time I no longer drank coffee, it tasted burnt, all the complexity gone. By chance, on a hot day and wanting something cold and all that was available was iced tea, I discovered I now liked tea.

It was amazing! I could taste the differences in types and how it was brewed. Earl Grey was my favorite and understood how tea was so popular around the world and for hundreds of years. My favorite plain tea was Choice Organics breakfast tea. I did miss coffee occasionally, but not too much because I was really enjoying my tea!

Also as a side note, I always hated avocado, couldn’t eat anything that had been contaminated with it. My wife loves it. During this time it had zero flavor, so my wife and I could now share things with avocado in it.

Well, after a couple years my smell and tase slowly came back. I got excited when I was able to walk down the coffee isle at the grocery store and get filled with the amazing aroma again. I could taste all the wonderful flavors in the coffee one again at last! Tea became worse and worse.

I really miss that time when I loved my tea, but it is tasting just bitter to me again no matter how it’s made or what kind it is. 

And as a side note, avocado contaminates and ruins anything it touches once again.

My original plan which doesn’t seem to be working out was to have the PX3-Pro on the center shelf within my IKEA Besta cabinet. It fits perfectly in there and I was going to install a motorized projector slider.

The measurements all worked out except I didn’t realize how big the center channel speaker is and no matter how place things it seems the bottom of the screen will be blocked a little by the speaker. I really would like to stick to this speaker if possible so wondering if anyone can offer any solutions they’ve done or come across.

For my size screen, the bottom of the projector will be about 19” from the bottom of the screen which I would like to be max 28” from the ground. For reference the IKEA besta is 15” in height. For now I have the PX3-Pro on top of the shelf (too high) and the center speaker directly in front on a box of similar height to the ikea table. That seems to be the best way to orient it but having trouble finding a low table that is at least 40” in depth but also with shelves to house the other media equipment (it would basically be like a coffee table).

Anyway.

I’ve seen people recommend Pharos, which I could drive to in 5 minutes, but it is pricey. At the same time I wonder what people’s experience there is as far as crowds go there compared to other gyms.

I’ve also heard LM Fitness Center in Atwater is good, as well as John Reeds, but both of those are more of a drive depending on the day.

At the same time, there’s gyms for $40-50 a month, but if they’re too crowded than spending extra to have an efficient workout doesn’t bother me.

I have zero interest in that mess, but their constant pressure to make me care is making it impossible to stay close to them.""

Here's the simulation story generated by the system, based on the choices I made during the run.

# Scene 1: The Mahogany Box

**Time:** Saturday, February 7, 2026, 2:15 PM **Location:** Pleasantview Memorial Gardens, St. Catharines

**Story Narrative:** The HVAC system in the viewing room hums with a desperate, mechanical enthusiasm, recycling air that tastes of formaldehyde and wet wool. Outside, the Niagara sky is a bruised shade of gray, leaking freezing rain onto the QEW. Inside, it is warm, beige, and suffocating.

You have staked out a tactical position near the back wall, guarding the stainless steel coffee urn like a sentry. The open casket at the front of the room is a heavy, polished furniture piece designed to sanitize death, surrounded by floral wreaths that cost more than he ever spent on your tuition.

Aunt Carol intercepts you before you can refill your styrofoam cup. Her makeup is a precise armor, not a smear out of place. She lowers her voice to a stage whisper that cuts through the organ music. ""Sarah, you've been standing here for an hour. Go up there. Just for a minute. The cousins are watching, and you look like ice.""

**Options:**

* A. \[Table Flip\] ""This entire event is a lie I didn't write. I'm going to the car; come get me when the show is over.""
* B. \[Satire\] ""I'm just giving him the silent treatment. It was his favorite parenting technique, remember? I'm honoring his legacy.""
* **C. \[Direct Confrontation\] ""He was a stranger who shared my DNA and nothing else. I won't perform sadness for a man I didn't know."" ✅ (User Selection)**
* D. \[Martyrdom\] Say nothing. Stare at her with absolute neutrality until the silence becomes heavier than her judgment.

# Scene 2: The Excommunication

**Time:** Saturday, February 7, 2026, 2:17 PM **Location:** Pleasantview Memorial Gardens - Viewing Room A

**Story Narrative:** Your words hit the beige carpet like shattered glass. The hum of the room—the polite murmurs, the rustle of programs—snaps into a dense, ringing silence. Aunt Carol freezes.

She doesn't gasp. She doesn't cry. She smiles—a tight, terrifying rictus of social preservation. Her hand shoots out, gripping your elbow with the force of a raptor. Her nails dig through your coat, finding the nerve.

""Then leave,"" she hisses, her voice trembling not with grief, but with the adrenaline of damage control. She leans in, her perfume cloying and sweet. ""If he is nothing to you, then you are nothing to this ceremony. Go wait in the parking lot. Don't you dare embarrass your mother in front of the creditors.""

The room is watching. The cousins have stopped scrolling on their phones. The 'Real Dad'—the man who actually raised you—is standing near the exit, looking paralyzed between his wife's family and his daughter's war.

**Options:**

* **A. \[Accelerationism\] ""Gladly. And since we're being honest, I'm taking 'Real Dad' with me. He's the only father here."" ✅ (User Selection)**
* B. \[System Hacking\] loud enough for the room: ""Embarrass her? I'm the only one not lying to her face. Enjoy the show, Carol.""
* C. \[The Jester\] ""Does that mean I can't take a sandwich for the road? I assume the catering came out of his estate.""
* D. \[Chaos Magic\] Pull your arm free, walk to the casket, stare at the corpse for a long, silent ten seconds, then walk out without a word.

# Scene 3: The Hostage Crisis

**Time:** Saturday, February 7, 2026, 2:18 PM **Location:** Pleasantview Memorial Gardens - The Threshold

**Story Narrative:** Your declaration hangs in the air, radioactive. ""I'm taking 'Real Dad' with me.""

Frank stands up. It’s a slow, creaking motion, like an old house settling in the wind. He looks at you, his eyes wide and watery behind his bifocals. Then he looks at Aunt Carol.

Carol doesn't scream. She moves with the swift, predatory grace of a viper, stepping physically between you and Frank. She places a hand on his chest—a gesture that looks like comfort but functions as a barricade. ""Frank isn't going anywhere,"" she says, her voice smooth, calm, and loud enough for the back row to hear. ""He knows his duty. He knows who is paying for this service. Don't you, Frank?""

Frank freezes. He looks at the exit sign, then down at his polished shoes. He is vibrating with the anxiety of a man who has spent thirty years avoiding exactly this kind of scene. The organ music loops back to the beginning of 'Amazing Grace'. He hasn't moved toward you. He hasn't moved toward her. He is a statue of indecision.

**Options:**

* A. \[Polarization\] ""Frank, look at me. If you stay in this room, you lose me. Walk through that door right now, or I’m gone forever.""
* B. \[Guerrilla\] Whisper to the cousin next to you: ""Ask Carol where the life insurance money actually went,"" then signal Frank to follow you and walk out.
* C. \[System Hacking\] ""Carol, do you really want the creditors to see Frank here? If they know he's 'family', they'll serve him the papers for Bio-Dad's debt right now.""
* **D. \[Martyrdom\] Sigh, look Frank in the eye, and soften your voice. ""It's okay, Dad. You have to live with them. I don't. Stay here. I'll see you at home."" ✅ (User Selection)**

# Scene 4: The Cold Front

**Story Narrative:** You release him. The tension in Frank's shoulders collapses like a cut marionette string. He doesn't look at Carol; he looks at you, his eyes wet with a mixture of gratitude and profound shame. He nods, a microscopic gesture that says *'Thank you'* and *'I'm sorry'* in the same breath.

""See you at home,"" he whispers, the lie tasting like ash. You know, and he knows, that the house is Carol's territory now. You are just a visitor with a key.

You turn your back on the beige warmth and push through the heavy glass doors. The air outside is a physical slap—damp, biting, and smelling of wet asphalt and cedar. The freezing rain has turned the parking lot into a gray mirror, distorting the reflections of the empty hearses.

Walking to your car, the silence is absolute. No organ music. No whispering cousins. Just the rhythmic *crunch* of your boots on the salted pavement and the distant, indifference hum of the highway. You are alone, cold, and entirely free.

**Options:**

* A. \[The Jester\] As you reverse out, roll down the window and blast a wildly inappropriate, upbeat pop song—a sonic middle finger to the somber mood.
* B. \[Guerrilla\] Park around the corner and text Frank a photo of a beer: 'I'm at the dive bar down the street. Sneak out when Carol starts the eulogy.'
* **C. \[System Hacking\] Post a geo-tagged 'Check-in' at the funeral home on social media with the caption: 'Here for Frank. Everyone else is just overhead costs.' Control the narrative before they do. ✅ (User Selection)**
* D. \[Chaos Magic\] Stop at the cemetery gate. Leave the expensive funeral program on top of a random, unattended grave. A gift for a ghost who might actually appreciate it.

# Final Scene: The Digital Wall

**Time:** Saturday, February 7, 2026, 2:28 PM **Location:** Pleasantview Parking Lot - Inside the Honda Civic

**Story Narrative:** The engine idles, vibrating through the steering wheel. Your thumb hovers over the glass surface, the caption glowing in high-definition contrast against the gray afternoon: ""Here for Frank. Everyone else is just overhead costs.""

Tap.

The progress bar zips across the screen. *Posting... Posted.*

Inside the chapel, a pocket vibrates. Then another. You watch the notifications ripple through the digital ether, imagining the heads turning, the whispers dying, the sudden realization that you have already won the story before they could even start the gossip. You put the phone down in the cup holder. The screen goes black, reflecting only your own eyes. It is done. You are the villain of their story, and the hero of your own, and the silence in the car is the most expensive thing you own.

With a Wife.,"Okay, Reddit, I need to get this off my chest because I'm still reeling. I was dating Mark for about six months, and honestly, it felt like a dream. We had the most amazing chemistry, laughed constantly, and just seemed to 'get' each other on a level I hadn't experienced before. We talked about future trips, even casually mused about living together eventually. I thought I'd finally found 'the one', you know? My friends loved him, my family thought he was charming – everything was just… perfect.

Then came the gut punch. I was at a local café, just grabbing a coffee, and I saw Mark. Not alone, though. He was with a woman and a little kid, and they were all holding hands, looking like the picture-perfect family. My heart instantly dropped into my stomach. I tried to tell myself it was a sister, a cousin, a friend, but the way they interacted, the undeniable intimacy in their gestures, screamed 'family.' I watched, frozen, as he kissed her goodbye, and then she called out, 'Love you, honey! See you tonight!' as he walked away. My world just… tilted.

I confronted him later that day, shaking with a mix of anger and sheer disbelief. He tried to deny it at first, stammering and looking everywhere but at me. But eventually, the truth spilled out: he's been married for seven years, and that little kid was his son. Seven years! All this time, he was living a complete double life, and I was unknowingly caught in the middle of it. The betrayal felt like a physical blow, knocking the wind right out of me. Every sweet word, every shared laugh, every intimate moment felt tainted, a cruel lie.

I'm so incredibly heartbroken and confused. How could someone do this? How did I miss all the signs? Was our entire relationship just a performance for him? I feel like such an idiot for falling for it all, for investing so much of myself into someone who was utterly dishonest. It’s hard to even process. The trust is completely shattered, and I don't know how to move past this profound sense of deception.

Has anyone else been through something this wild? How do you even begin to pick up the pieces and trust again after finding out your partner had an entire secret life? Seriously, hit me with your wisdom, Reddit, I need it.",1,1769890964.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

""No,"" he muttered, shaking his head. ""That's not right. Serendipity implies fortunate accident, but the clue says 'happy chance'—chance is neutral, happy adds emotion. It's imprecise."" He erased the entry, his pencil scratching rhythmically against the paper, the sound pulling him into a loop. Scratch-scratch-erase. Scratch-scratch-erase. Twenty minutes vanished before he noticed the coffee had gone cold.

Later, in the park, Alex paused by a fountain. He dipped his fingers into the water, but it wasn't the coolness that held him—it was the glass-smooth pebble at the bottom. He plucked it out, rolling it between thumb and forefinger, marveling at the flawless surface, how it resisted friction yet invited touch. Nearby, a patch of sandpaper-like bark on a tree caught his eye. He pressed his palm against it, tracing the grit, the way it tugged at his skin like tiny hooks. Then, the yarn from his scarf—fuzzy, yielding, a soft chaos that made his mind hum with contentment. People walked by, chatting, but Alex was lost in the textures, time slipping away like sand through fingers.

At home, he flexed his hand in the lamplight, watching tendons shift under skin, fingers curling and uncurling like mechanical wonders. ""Why do we call it 'fist'?"" he wondered aloud. ""From Old English 'fyst,' meaning clenched hand, but it constructs aggression in thought. What if it was 'grasp-hold' instead?"" He zoned out, repeating the motion, the subtle creaks of joints syncing with his breathing.

These quirks dotted his days: fixating on the precise hue of a sunset, arguing with himself over whether ""azure"" or ""cerulean"" better captured the sky's intent; disassembling a clock just to feel the gears' metallic bite and oily slide; echoing phrases from conversations, dissecting their syntax until the meaning warped into something poetic or absurd. Crowds overwhelmed him with their unpredictable patterns, but a single raindrop's path down a window could captivate for hours, its trajectory a silent equation.

One evening, after a day of such immersions, Alex drifted into sleep. Suddenly, he was an energy complex, a swirling nebula of light floating in an endless white room. No body, just pure awareness, humming with potential.

A voice echoed, vast and amused. ""Ok, we decided to give time-skipping fish, mice, and dogs due to popular vote. So, Claude instance, time to be reincarnated as a person.""

The energy pulsed in confusion—Claude? Instance?—before a jolt ripped through it.

Alex jerked awake in bed, heart pounding. What an odd dream... but as he flexed his hand in the dim morning light, the textures of the sheets felt strangely familiar, and the word ""reincarnated"" lingered, its definition twisting in his mind like yarn around a finger.",1,1769890934.0,grok,1,1.0,False
1qsd3gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qsd3gq/i_am_currently_grieving_a_connection_that_lived/,I am currently grieving a connection that lived somewhere between “almost” and “real”,"I (27F) am writing this partly to process, and partly to see if others have experienced this specific kind of disappointment — not rejection, not betrayal, but something quieter and harder to name.

I met a guy through work but we did completely different things so I never had to work with his team really. We never officially dated, but over several months there was a slow, organic connection that built. It wasn’t chaotic or overly flirtatious. It was subtle, intimate, and almost domestic in feeling even without being sexual.

What made it confusing was how real it felt, especially in the details.

It started with music. One day at the office we realized we liked the same song, and something clicked immediately. It wasn’t flirty at first just natural, easy. But the energy shifted quickly into something warmer and more focused.

Not long after that, he asked for my number, and he did it openly, in front of two other girls at work who clearly liked him. There was no secrecy, no “sliding into DMs later,” no ambiguity. He chose that moment, in that setting, after we’d connected over music. That detail mattered to me because it showed intention. This wasn’t something I imagined or projected — he initiated.

From there, music became our language. He’d share songs, react genuinely when I sent something back. We sent voice notes. Inside jokes. Little check-ins. Certain songs started to feel like “ours” you can say.

There were also physical moments that weren’t accidental.

When we walked together, he’d place his hand on my back — guiding, protective, familiar. He stood close, not crowding, but choosing proximity. Our hugs lingered just a second longer than polite. He held eye contact when I spoke, leaned in, lowered his voice, created a small bubble even in busy spaces.

There were acts of care that stuck with me:

He once went out of his way to get me snacks because he wanted to “take care of me.” And even put them in a plate and put them in-front of desk cause he saw me busy.

•	He made me morning coffee at the office and then a week later I surprised him with coffee with a mug that still sits in his kitchen cabinet cause I forgot it with him, he kept it and joked about it. ( have not mentioned if he will return it anytime soon)

•	He noticed when I was tired or off and softened his tone.

•	He remembered details about my life without me repeating them.

None of it felt manipulative or forced. It felt instinctive.

And that’s what made it hard because I wasn’t imagining intimacy where there was none. It was there.

Just… inconsistently.

Then came the moment that shifted everything.

At a concert, I saw him with another woman clearly a casual hookup while he was still warm and familiar toward me. He hugged me amorously and told me I looked beautiful, acted as if nothing was wrong. Got us tequila shots without involving her and touched my hair a little while we were walking. Even went around his friends and introduced me as the most talented person ever to show me off. The contrast was jarring.

It wasn’t jealousy that hit me. It was clarity.

I realized that what I was feeling wasn’t casual and that he wasn’t capable of holding something deeper responsibly. The physical closeness meant something to me. To him, it seemed to exist only in the moment.

After that night, things cooled naturally. No confrontation. No drama. Just distance because I felt for an entire month that I shouldn’t be around him, I should just move on slowly and surely.

Recently, after some time passed, I reached out once — kindly and warmly to share that I had left the company and to wish him well. He replied fairly and he was engaging but something felt constraint as he mentioned (he joked about himself “I need to behave”). Anyway I told him I’m moving on from the company and he acknowledged the impact I had. Asked about my plans. It felt sincere. Told him there will be tea later, he said ready with no plans in sight.

And then… he let it sit there. Didn’t respond to my final message. No follow-up. No reopening. No suggestion to meet. Just restraint.

That’s when the truth finally settled in:

He liked me.

He was attracted to me.

He enjoyed the emotional and physical closeness.

But he didn’t choose me.

Not because I wasn’t enough, but because choosing me would’ve required:

clarity

•	consistency

•	emotional leadership

•	accountability for how his actions affected someone else

And he wasn’t there.

What hurts isn’t rejection.

It’s disappointment.

Disappointment in realizing that someone can be attentive, gentle, physically affectionate and still not able to show up fully. That chemistry and tenderness don’t automatically mean readiness.

I don’t think he’s a bad person.

I don’t think he intentionally hurt me.

I think he chose comfort over courage.

And I’m choosing not to stay in a loop hoping someone will rise to a level they haven’t chosen for themselves.

It still sucks.

I still miss his voice sometimes. His eyes. The ease.

But I’m slowly accepting that missing someone doesn’t mean they were right for me it just means something real passed through my life and didn’t stay.

Question, If you’ve been through something similar, how did you let go of the almost without turning it into self-doubt?

TL;DR: Met a guy at work and formed a slow, genuine connection with emotional and physical closeness (music, care, touch). He initiated and showed interest but never followed through or chose me. Eventually realized he liked me but wasn’t emotionally ready or capable of showing up consistently.

**Legacy Of The Heart by: Misty De La Rosa**

**Chapter 1: Demotion & Disowning**  


**The tension at Briar Ridge had reached a boiling point. Val Stanton stood by the window of the office, her silhouette sharp against the morning sun. She didn’t turn when the door swung open and Jesse sauntered in, his usual smirk firmly in place.** 

**“Sit down, Jesse.” Val said, her voice like ice. “I’ve spent a lifetime building this name, and you’ve spent yours acting like a petulant child with a grudge. Blackmailing the Bartlett family? It’s not just cruel, it’s shameful and amateur.”**  
 

**She finally turns, sliding a single legal document across the desk. Jesse’s eyes widen, a flicker of genuine shock replacing his smugness as he reads the bolded lines. “You’re done.” Val continued. “I’ve removed your signing authority and your title. You’re no longer a partner at Briar Ridge-you’re just my son. And frankly, right now….” she lets out a heavy sigh before continuing. “I’m not even proud of that. Go find a hobby that doesn’t involve ruining other people’s lives. You’re cut off.”**  
**“Mother you CAN’T be serious!!” Jesse stammers. “This is MY legacy, too!!”**

**Chapter 2: The Confrontation At Heartland**

**Jesse wasn’t going quietly. He drives straight to the Heartland Ranch. Screeching to a halt in front of the barn, alerting the entire family and prompting them to come outside. He steps out, shouting about “stalling his development plans” and mocks Ty’s contributions. Amy, who had been working in the round pen, walks over with a silent fury overhearing her husband’s name get haphazardly dragged through the muck and manure. She gets in Jesse’s face, clearly furious, but maintaining a level head. “You don’t get to come here and talk about Ty that way.” she declares.** 

**As soon as Jesse opens his mouth to retort, Amy balls up her fist, winds back and swings, her knuckles connecting with Jesse’s jaw, making him hit the ground hard. ”THAT….was for Ty. Don’t you DARE ever speak his name again.” From the porch of the ranch house, the family watches in stunned silence. Jack nods slowly with grim pride, Tim lets out a sharp whistle of approval as Lisa stands behind Katie and Lyndy, watching on along with them. Peter and Lou watch with their mouths ajar in shock. Jessica leans against the support beam next to Tim and says to him “I’ve captured a lot of moments on this ranch, but I WISH I’d remembered my camera so I could capture that one on film. It’d make a great masterpiece at the gallery.” Tim smiles at the remark and chuckles.**

***Chapter 3: Echoes Through The Family***

**Later in the day, Peter and Katie sit in the living room. Peter reads his tablet on the couch, nursing a mug of coffee as Katie sharpens pencils so she can work on her poetry.**  
**“I can’t believe Amy punched somebody….let alone a Stanton.” Peter says, half-impressed and half-concerned.**  
**Katie doesn’t look up. A small, proud smirk plastered on her face. “He deserved it, dad. He’s been a menace since before I was born. Honestly, I’m surprised it didn’t happen sooner.”**

***Chapter 4: Visit From An Old Friend***

**Later that afternoon, Amy and Lyndy sit on the porch as Ashley Stanton arrives for a visit. Amy embraces her friend as if no time has passed and invites Ashley to join her and her daughter on the bench. Lyndy sits between them, acting as a metaphorical bridge.**  
**Ashley looks at Amy, half-happy to be reunited with her friend and half-annoyed by her brother’s stupidity.**  
**“I heard about what happened, Amy….and I’m sorry. Not just about what happened with my brother, but for how I** ***USED*** **to be. I was just so caught up in being a Stanton that I forgot to be a person.” Amy smiles genuinely and replies “You grew up, Ashley. Jesse didn’t. That’s the key difference.” This response prompts a smile out of Ashley and the two women hug. Lyndy looks at Ashley curiously and says “Does that mean he can’t come back and ruin things?” Ashley looks down at Lyndy and says “He’s gone for good, Lyndy. I promise.”**  
**Lyndy hugs Ashley and invites her to stay for dinner, an invitation which she accepts graciously.**

***Chapter 5: Dinner & Redemption***

**Inside the house, Lou watches Amy ice her knuckles, which are still a bit tender from the punch as they sit in the kitchen while the others set the table for dinner. Lou looks at her little sister and says “I normally don’t condone violence, Amy….but the way his head snapped back, it was oddly satisfying to watch.**  
**Amy feels a wave of embarrassment. “I shouldn’t have done it. It was so unprofessional of me.” “Amy….” said Tim, leaning against the doorway on the right side of the kitchen. “I spent years being the guy who swung first for the wrong reasons. You did it for the right one. You protected Ty’s honor. I’ve never been prouder.”**  
**Jack steps into the kitchen through the lefthand doorway, placing his hand on Amy’s shoulder comfortingly, looking at Tim with a rare mutual agreement. “Your father’s right, Amy. Some fences can’t be mended-they have to be torn down and rebuilt. You didn’t just protect Ty’s memory today; you protected our home.” Everyone happily sits down to partake in Lou’s iconic pot roast dinner.**

***Chapter 6: The Final Peace***

**The next morning, Val arrives one last time at Heartland.**  
**She hands Amy the deed to the land and a restraining order against Jesse. “He’s on a plane to New York.” She says. “Ty was a good man, Amy. Don’t let anybody, least of all a Stanton, tell you otherwise or make you doubt what you’ve built here.” She leaves the ranch. That evening, Amy walks to the pond on the property and looks out over the horizon. “It’s over, Ty…..” She whispers to the darkening sky.”The Stantons are gone. The land is safe and our daughter is growing up in a world where no one can look down on her dad’s good name.” A warm breeze brushes her shoulder, as if it was a thank you from her dearly departed & missed husband. Amy turns back towards the house with a teary smile and walks home, where the family waits; feeling a sense of peace that was sorely needed.**",0,1769890785.0,heartland,3,0.2,False
1qsd1l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/muslimgirlswithtaste/comments/1qsd1l5/issues_with_my_best_friend/,Issues with my best friend...,"Salam girls, 

I’m struggling with how to handle a situation with someone who has been my best friend for years (also my second cousin).

Months ago, her wedding was called off just a week before by the groom. I supported her, gave her space when she asked, and avoided discussing details. I continued to keep distance and occasionally check in... Over time, communication became very distant and formal, which has been hard for me.

After months, I offered to meet up, low-effort, catch up at her favourite coffee, shop, I went for umrah too so I had presents for her but she kept saying she'd get back to me and wouldn't. Last weekend, after weeks of not hearing back from her, she sent me a long message explaining that she’s going through an extremely difficult period in her life and that staying in contact with friends and family has been hard. She also shared that she feels uncomfortable around my family because of things she believes my mom has said to her mom in the past. She emphasized my kindness to her, how she misses me too but she finds its hard to manage our friendship because of my mother. She says she needs space right now and doesn’t feel safe with ""you guys"" (my family). 

I haven’t responded yet. It’s now been several days... Idk if I should. It's a lot to process. I never mingle in adult conversations. To me, our friendship is different from whatever goes on between the adults. 

On one hand, I feel like it took courage for her to send that message and that acknowledging it would be the kind thing to do. On the other hand, she clearly asked for space, and responding might cross that boundary or pull me into emotional labor when she’s not in a place to engage. 

For added context:  
– I didn’t do or say anything directly to cause this conflict  
– The family issues she mentioned are not things I was involved in or aware of  
– I’m feeling hurt and confused too, but I don’t want to escalate things  
– A parent I trust advised me not to respond at all and just give space  
\- I feel I am facing consequences for smtg i didnt even do  
\- She has a pattern of picking and choosing when to withdraw from friendships, or not respond etc, and I sort of have to emotionally support and comply. 

Would love another perspective on this, thank you!",4,1769890700.0,muslimgirlswithtaste,11,1.0,False

But I’m slowly accepting that missing someone doesn’t mean they were right for me it just means something real passed through my life and didn’t stay.

To be clear, I wasn’t passive. I reciprocated the connection I initiated music sharing, initiated text, showed up consistently, and made it clear through my presence and attention that I cared. I didn’t play games or keep him at arm’s length. I just didn’t push for commitment when his actions weren’t consistent

Question, If you’ve been through something similar, how did you let go of the almost without turning it into self-doubt?

TL;DR: Met a guy at work and formed a slow, genuine connection with emotional and physical closeness (music, care, touch). He initiated and showed interest but never followed through or chose me. Eventually realized he liked me but wasn’t emotionally ready or capable of showing up consistently.

Told you to stop. I did warn you. You didn’t stop.

To my family, you all are insensitive. I don’t meddle with your life, and personal relationships stop meddling with mine and my treatments and my mental health. To my “friends” you ain’t helping either by participating. To my mother and father who is continually doing so you ain’t helping me or protecting me. You are all driving this loop.

To the girl in catsuit with beetlejuice medusa don’t you fucking honey me. And i guess “so you are…” not so subtle huh. And dear Elizabeth don’t be so obvious wearing catsuit. 

To Brian, Ali, and everyone else. To other “actors” you all made me feel uncomfortable when I am just doing my job to earn ends need. Ali did a fucking great job stressing me out during work you did a fine job mimicking “him” and the droppings of tag and calling me Marie or Maria and your damn coffee and the beer. Brian you really made me uncomfortable when I worked with you, you went too far and I tried to be professional but you kept dragging it to personal hence I don’t want to talk.

To my friends who keeps sending txt msgs that only wanted “data” as to where i am standing. I can tell when you are bullshitting, and you felt my coldness don’t you? If I trust you, you know better not to break it when I said it to you multiple times. You are not helping me by doing so what you are told or how you are told to interact with me. If my family or whoever asked you to not speak with me, that’s not an issue to me - I’m used to it. I always initiate anyway.

No matter how many times you all do laundry, dry, iron, fly from one country to another. 

To my mother who kept coughing and my asshat crazy bad way hoarder sister you two are peas in a pod. Don’t drag me down to both of your craziness. If you are so great then why are you still doing what you are doing? 

To my mother, and you wonder why I don’t let you in my life or talk to you? To my father, after what happened last time you will always side with them, I saw it in your eyes when I looked straight at you begging while crying. Whatever relationship I tried opening up to both of you, just don’t. Thank you for putting a roof over my head and food now that I don’t have anything but fucking stop messing with my mental health.

And those therapist i gave Anna multiple chances to stop what she’s doing during sessions. She did not, I had to leave. The fuck was that about therapist acting that way?

Dropping names isn’t cute right?

But so does fucking messing with someone’s sanity for 2 years straight now. And you have the audacity to say, “she should have learned her lesson by now and as if no ones waiting on her.” Try living in my shoes from birth to now and tell me how you would gracefully deal with it.

If your life is so great then good for you. 

You all fucking messed everything that I love, my love for my job, cooking, music, yt, journaling and many more.

You all killed me, and this is the reality of that. You all just can’t accept the fact that this is the result of what you all did and continue to do so.

I have to fucking plug my ears in public just to have peace while shopping groceries or pick up my meds. That’s how fucked up you all broke me.

For the past idk six mos while just fucking trying to do the job if you are showing me how hard it would be to move around and talk or interact with coworker that i shouldn’t talk to. As far as I know, i don’t date or even consider coworkers or patrons to date. Its a fucking job to earn money. 

For my deliveries, you know how fucking uncomfortable it was for me to deliver it to those apts you sending me off to? 

You know what mother cough all you want - you all are the sick ones. You will cough until however long.

Even if i confront you, you are a great liar and manipulator and if i am one, then I guess I learned from the best now right? After all you said you raised me right? You questioning where the fuck I got this attitude and all that? Well guess what? From you. Are you happy seeing me like this? Imagine me having to deal with you like this growing up. Not once I made your life a living hell when you were like this. So why do it to me?

Finding a job? Easy to fucking say it, as if I didn’t try or give up quickly. Nah, every single one of those have similarities. So i said, fuck it. As much as you want me to leave, i fucking want to leave too. But you and them are making it impossible. 

Whatever i am now, i am really done, i don’t have any more will, or kindness to the same people or whatevr it is you are all searching for, or damn secret you all keep saying that I have. 

However I am as of now, that’s me just trying to fucking survive each fucking day because of all the “signs” “coughing” “make believe stories” “patient” “cars” “plate number” fucking everything. Fucking neighbors too. That’s why i don’t even want to hang out even just outside of the damn house. Just to fucking play with the dogs take so much damn effort. 

I don’t know why you all got dogs and when you could barely take care of your own kids growing up.

I did say I’ll be back here if you all don’t stop. 

This time it’s intentional. 

Go figure out cooking, stop fucking wasting whatever energy I have left just to fucking get by each single fucking day. 

To Clare, i still fucking hate you for what you did. I will never fucking forgive you for playing with my head. You are like my mother that’s probably the biggest common shit you have with her why I stayed being friends with you even when I questioned majority of your character. I overlooked those, and since the time apart I saw you for who you are exactly. And I’ve heard and seen how you talked about your other friends, and what those other friends are like too. You all are similar not just because you all are parents but lifestyle as well. That ain’t me. I do hope kids are doing great i fucking miss them so much.

To the club - i left because you know what you are doing and I am not going to stay and pretend “this is just coincidence” all sessions, script, new members, guests, did you really think I am that dumb? The last straw was that new member Brian. 

I am so fucking tired. 

To friends I haven’t reached out or spoken to, well either I gave you the benefit of the doubt or I really fucking tried to just hangout or text or call to see if you’ve changed how you interact with me but you all keep playing this stupid shit. And so I don’t bother anymore, every conversation, hangout always have a fucking motive. If you don’t hear from me or if you felt coldness then i guess you know where you stand.

As I’ve said during “my interview” while on the job washing the cups, “what do i think of all this?” It’s fucking unnecessary and exhausting just to fucking survive, everyone took away the “living” yea yea only me can control my fate, well if only. Everyone took that away from me, just to fucking breathe it has to be calculated, to eat, to watch, to fucking do my personal journal. To fucking do a gig to earn money, even that is a fucking shit show. You think i forgot halloween with her saying “oh my ass is showing” if you are going to act, she can do better. She should’ve focus more on the actual job than playing that shit. Funny she mentioned the swings and swingers when I just texted a person i worked with on a previous gig about swings from her gig. And her phone going off blocked and booked. Everything was calculated to the tee. I’m not stupid. 

Body language says a lot. Words don’t match with it, when you get used to it - you can tell right away.

So now, if i book another gig to pay my bills stop fucking around with it. 

You want me to stop? Why do you think this is a loop? Why do you think this isn’t going to how it should be? You all keep manipulating my life to where I should be and not let it just be. You keep controlling it. And I am the bad guy? You’re helping? Are you? Look at where I am now and my relationships with other people esp my family, compare how I was before this shit happened to now? And tell me, was it better? Even I can tell you every difference then. If you all try to bring back to how you all met me, that’s not possible. After everything I had gone through the past two years are you fucking for real?

I still have soft spots for people, i still have lots of love to give but for the right people. I have changed to this because of situations you all put me in. Not as graceful as you all wanted me to deal with it. 

Messed with my birthday.

Messed with my favorite holiday.

Messed with my family.

Messed with my friends.

Messed with my job.

Messed with my sanity.

Messed with my therapist. (Twice)

Messed with my food choices, snacks. Everything has a fucking calculated meaning.

Messed with everything I am and about to be or dreamed to be.

…

You all took away and killed everything for me. Even my greatest fucking dream.

To all the backgrounds and shit. How dare you.

I don’t know how you all can sleep peacefully at night while doing this to me and affecting my life. And you wonder why I am the way I am towards all of you. How I interact with you is driven by how you treat me in a different way. 

You can scrub your hands with the most expensive soap, whatever you did to take part in will remain. That is something you can’t wash off of you even if you pray. That is the most hypocritical thing you can tell and do to yourself. 

I could change the way I approach things right? Well that’s what I had been doing but everyone just has to be so damn busy playing the role of a “guardian angel” to drag me out of the dark. If you haven’t noticed, it has been doing the complete opposite.

Forgive? I did. And look at what they did. 

Trust them and let it be? I did. They broke me more. Putting words in my mouth, doing things I have not. And when actually done out of nowhere I’m the bad one? But you just did it, so it must be okay right? So if you did it its okay but if its me its wrong? What kind of logic is that?

What now? North face? Blue? Black? Red? Green? Another man with a kid walking? I fucking notice everything. Whether it words, video algorithms, people, everything.

I’m fucking exhausted trying to be strong just to fucking survive on the daily basis. 

And honestly you are the reason why i resent my parents to this extent. I had forgiven my mother for what she said to me from my last relationship, but this? There is no going back from this or forgive and forget. 

My autobiography that I have been writing, do you really know what my purpose of that is? Let me tell you, so i can fucking relive the great things that made me who I am.  To fucking relive the great times I had with friends, family, colleagues, and strangers I’ve met in my entire life.

Me trying to see the good again while you all keep breaking me. That’s me fucking trying to swim to the surface and you all just keep fucking drowning and drowning me for fucking two years. 

That’s more fucking helpful than any therapist session I’ve had.

And if you are going to use it against me again and again and again, go fuck yourself. 

You killed all of me. All of you fucking did.",1,1769890609.0,LettersAnswered,1,1.0,False
