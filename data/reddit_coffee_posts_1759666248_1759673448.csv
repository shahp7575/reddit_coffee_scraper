I pounded down the streets.  My breaths were ragged.  It felt like my heart was going to burst.  People stared, but I couldn’t stop to care.  When an ~~exterminator~~ officer was in a frantic rush on an otherwise lovely paw, you could only assume how bad things actually were.  Like watching a flowerbird freaking out because somewhere in its grain-sized brain, it *knew* something big was coming.  Soon, everyone else would scream too.

I hoped I wasn’t the flowerbird.

*\~Gotta … catch the train.  Rest when I … catch the train,\~* I told myself.  *\~There it is.  It’s-* ***no!  It’s leaving!”***

“Hey!  ***Wait!”*** I bleated.

A Human lady had just stepped through the door.  She froze when she saw me.  Eyes wide.  You’d think she’d spotted a shadestalker.  Why the reaction?

***“Please!”*** I begged.

She bit her lip and looked away.  The door eased shut.  At the last scratch, she stuck out her hand, stopping it.  That was all I needed.

I barreled through the door and smacked into the opposite side of the train car.  Thankfully, it wasn’t a super busy claw.

“Th-thank …”  It was hard to finish the sentence when the coughing fit set in.

The lady barely glanced at me, returning her attention to her phone.  She seemed afraid to look me in the eye.  Why-?  *Ohhhh …*

I looked down at my uniform.  Exterminator.  We may have rebranded ourselves as ‘officers’, but that’s not what the Humans saw.  They saw the face of pain and scorn all but sworn.  I knew the feeling, because I saw the same thing.  … No.  Not quite the same thing.  Mom was an ext- a *member of the guild.*  So was Selgin.  They didn’t deserve to share the same thought.  They were *not* the same thing, and yet they also were.  The Three Stooges were a thing of the past.  I would never be their prey again.  I’d never let anyone like them hurt someone like they did me.  Still, in the eyes of this woman, I was *predator.*  I was hurting her, just by being here.

My tail fell as some of the passengers inched past the Human to join my side of the train car.  No.  *Nononono.*  This wasn’t right!  I couldn’t let this-!

*\~… Okay.  Settle.  You’re not coughing your lungs out anymore.  You got this,\~* I told myself.

I removed my visor.  She wasn’t wearing a mask.  Good for her, and good for me.  I could meet her binocular gaze with both eyes.

“Thank you.  *Really,”* I emphasized, lightly wagging my tail.

I think the lady and half the train had some kind of stroke.

...

… Speaking of strokes, what was that?  Something came over me.  My ears shot up.  Wool puffed.  I rubbed my forehead through the lifted visor.

“You okay, honey?” the lady asked.

“Yeah … I think I’m just-”

I couldn’t focus.  Another wave hit me.  I found myself scanning the car.  It felt like there was something I hadn’t noticed, that I *needed* to notice.  My eyes kept stopping on the passengers’ pads and phones.  Strange.  A lot of people seemed more interested in their pads than being wary of the Human.  Murmurs of muted shock rippled through the car.  Regardless of what my eyes did, my ears had fixed on the lady beside me.  I couldn’t get them to stop angling at her head.  I think it was her earbuds.  The sounds leaking from them were chaotic, to say the least, but I couldn’t parse much.  I wasn’t overtly staring.  I was drinking what I could from the secondhand sounds, like I was stranded on the desert side, and they were my only water.  Normally, it would be a little rude, but Humans didn’t consider it impolite.  They didn’t have the cultural (or biological) context.

The lady was glancing between her phone and me again. 

“Is something wrong?” I ventured to ask her.

She gave me a funny look before showing me her phone.  My tail froze.  [The scene?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qOo5o1j6aQ)  Pikro’s Coffee Cradle.  The scenario?  Chaos.  Pure and utter chaos.  Someone was crazy enough to livestream it.

Lmur sprang from table to table, leveraging his leaps off the edges.  He hooked his tail on the edge behind him, neatly cutting his momentum.  He wasted no movements, flipping coffee cups into the air and kicking them with the skill of a Brazilian footballer.  It *would* have been impressive, if he wasn’t giggling like a gremlin.

**“Dodge** ***this!***  **Hyahahaahahaha!”** he cackled.

“You seem like a nice girl, but are you affiliated with this maniac?” the lady asked.

*Riiight.*  He was wearing my uniform.

*\~Stars, how do I even respond?\~*

I was harvesting my thoughts when a massive fist broke onto the screen.  A striped arm followed.  A dark, hulking mass of wool.  My brain *b̵̉͘rayed.*  My Fire ***r̵͍̈́̌oared.̴̞̐̎***

.

Oh.

*Him.*

Hammer fist.  He pounded the table.  It shattered like rotten wood.  Thankfully, the laughing Yotul had dove off table in time.  Barely.  He slid beneath another.  Brkar was after him like a landslide.

*“Gracious!*  *That man is a Venlil?”* the lady gasped.

I heard her, but also, not really.  My eye and ears were rooted to the screen.  They drank in every move, action and reaction, seared to memory.  I couldn’t tear them away if I tried.

Lmur ran himself to a dead end.  I couldn’t understand what he was doing, until he mounted the chairs and tables for height, kicking off the wall for leverage.  [Ever-moving, his leaps and kicks ricocheted between Brkar and the wall.](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxAJetPKCSjS62H8OaYtMjidE7ifJOhhjR?si=vweQoqzbjKyZ_Bgz)  His giggles had stopped.  He’d gone dead serious as he poured all his focus into fighting back the giant.  I couldn’t tell if the giggling Yotul was just a trick, and the *real* Lmur, or the locked-in Kantu menace before me.  It could have been both?

Taken off guard by the onslaught, Brkar went from bemusement to amusement.  A chuckle bubbled from his chest.  This change of tactics kept him off balance, until it didn’t.  If I blinked, I would have missed it.  He’d snatched at the Yotul, blazing-fast.  A scratch too slow.  Lmur had leapt.  Sailed over Brkar’s head, and dropped a splitting kick to the skull.

It did nothing.

Lmur was still in the air.  Before he could land behind the giant, Brkar spun to catch him.  That massive ~~jaw~~ paw I knew too well shot out to ~~bite~~ grab his tail.

Three beads the size of gargua seeds flew between the giant and the Yotul.  At their size and speed, I shouldn’t have seen them.  But I did.  For some reason, I saw *everything.*

They’d reached his wrist.  Detonated.  A smokescreen.  The shockwaves threw him off.

*fweee …*

A high-pitched whine.  A capacitor?

**POOM!**

An invisible force punched through the smoke.  Slammed right into Brkar’s face.  It peeled and flapped his lips from the gum, blasted back his wooly mane.  It looked like he’d stuck his head in a wind tunnel simulating five hurricanes at the same time.

A Venlil form darted through the smoke.

*Marjinl?*

Somehow, Brkar kept his wits about him.  Marjinl’s paw came like a spear.  Brkar shifted.  Where it would have struck his scars, it plunged into his wooly waist.  Barely broke skin.

Brkar swung a backhand.  Marjinl danced clear.  He aimed.

*fweee …*

**POOM!**

The giant’s arm was blasted off course.

*fweee …  fweee …*

**POOM!  POOM!**

Blast after blast pounded the giant hard as any punch, cratering his wool.

I saw two weapons in Marjinl’s paws.  Small, strange designs.  What were they firing?  What kind of weapon could do this?

*fweee …*

**POOM!**

“Hmm … not bad,” I mumbled.

The target dummy’s readings were pretty promising.  My weapon could use some fine tuning, but it was almost there.  Any Federation species short of a Mazic would have been pretty shaken, if they could still stand.  It wouldn’t leave any serious damage under most circumstances.  Like a padded punch.  Limitless ammo, so long as it could hold a charge.  I wished I could give it some range, like a vortex cannon, but weaponizing something like that was beyond me.  If I’d been more clever, maybe …

I felt my tail tap to the music a little.  It was a pretty good song.

“Oh, so it uses air pressure?  [Like a bullet?”](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxvm-3hb_koPPCWofb1BBBFrLUxc0cBIz3?si=5cadJg7NvFZr7LP-)

It was Kampa.  No one was supposed to be in the firing range at that time.  I suppose ‘no one’ included *me.*  I think I *would* have noticed her, if not for the music.  Not that I was complaining.

She carried herself with all the austerity of an exterminator, but there was a warmth her job had never robbed from her.  *‘Slay the predators.  Save the herd’.*  That was the way of the exterminators.  Too many exterminators forgot that last part.  It was all about slaying predators, and when there were none to slay?  They’d find them, one way or another.  They’d see predators in their fellow herd.  However, for all that predator-hunting business, she truly lit up when it came to helping the herd.  That’s wat the job was about.  Always the herd.  That was why I loved her.

Her partner, Scyran?  I could do without him.

Maybe I should stammer.  Flinch and stammer.  They’d surprised me.  That’s what Venlil do when they’re surprised.

“Y-yeah.  It uses air,” I stuttered.  “It’s called a B.A.R.C.: Burst Atmospheric Release Cannon.  I haven’t figured out how to make the air cohere over a distance, but I don’t think it needs to.  A couple tails should be fine enough.”

“Hm.  What’s it for?” she pressed.

“Remember that PD suspect a few paws back?” I asked.  “You guys escorted him to the holding areas with *flamethrowers.”*

“Yeah.  Not our best moment,” Kampa confessed.  “The tasers don’t work well against his hide and fur.”

“What if you didn’t *have* to use flamethrowers around prey?  Or tasers?” I pitched.  “What if you had something else subdue PD cases?  That’s what this is.  At least, what it’s supposed to be.”

“So you designed a weapon against prey?” Scyran deadpanned.

Stars.  Here we go.

“I designed a weapon to be *gentler* with PD cases,” I clarified, as if that would help.

His ears went back as he opened his mouth.

Thankfully, Kampa changed the subject.  “Where’d you find this music?  I like it.”

Okay.  Not so thankfully.

I didn’t answer.  Ha. even Scyran was tapping his tail ever so slightly to the beat.  That would end soon.  Kampa queried me with a head-tilt, but I still didn’t answer.  She’d find out in a scratch anyway.

Sure enough, [the singer snarled.](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxtBO-wfd5RgvK5GZ-SjrMFGem75yfpOQW?si=XgwdOL3Wx_eG2alv)

*🎵 “I don’t need no heroes.*

*🎵 No legends or stars.*

*🎵 The fight is within us.*

*🎵 Just open your hearts.*

*🎵 We ain’t going nowhere.*

*🎵 The city is ours.”*

My ears fell.

Scyran’s tail froze.  “It’s a Human song.”

We locked eyes for a moment.  I was trying not to glare, though I felt my wool flare.

*“… So?”* I challenged, my voice as level as Venlilly possible.

Scyran balked.  He obviously wasn’t used to being challenged.

“So, you’re coming with me.  You’re overdue for a screening,” he declared.

My blood ran vacuum-cold before turning hot as Solgalick.

*“What?”* I beeped.  “But I’ve been screened before!  I don’t ***want*** to see those recordings again!”

He stiffened at the edge in my tone.

“That was cycles ago.  PD cases can progress,” he countered.

“My screening showed *extreme* empathy,” I hissed, repressing the urge to bare my teeth.

“They also revealed extreme aggression.” he added.  “Your records show that you … made *sounds* during the screening.  ‘I’ve never heard a Venlil make a sound like that’, the screener wrote.”

Inhale.  Exhale.  I needed to stay calm.

“Have you ever been screened?” I asked carefully.  “Have you seen the part where the mother shoves her kid into the shuttle, just before the door closes?  The Arxur catches up with her and he starts … he starts eating.  She’s screaming for help, but they start the launch sequence.  No one lifts a paw.”

*“‘Lifts a paw?’*  What did you *expect* them to do?” Scyran hissed.  “When the herd is under attack, they *run.*  It’s the only thing to do.”

**“It was** ***one Arxur,*** **vs.** ***everyone!”*** I exploded.  **“They were right** ***there!***  **There was even a Mazic behind the door, and he did** ***NOTHING!***  **They just** ***WATCHED!***  **They didn’t even** ***TRY!***  **They just-!”**

My claws bit into my pads, fists clenched harder than stone.  I … I needed to break something.

I aimed the pressure gun at the dummy.  Didn’t have to look.  I’d practiced too much.  So, I dialed it to ‘Arxur’.  The capacitor fired up.

***FweeeEEEEE …***

Discharge.

# POOOOOOM!

The dummy shattered.  I felt a little better, but now Scryan’s paw was on his flamethrower.  Kampa’s was … halfway down to her own?  I … right.  Of course.  Who was I to think someone like me could be good for someone like her.  In my heart of hearts, all I knew was how to be broken, and to break.

…

“Do you know what happened to the pup in the screening?” I asked quietly.  “He fell off the face of the world.  I think he died.  His body was still moving, but he was dead.  He didn’t talk for almost a cycle.  No one knew who he was, or if he had next of kin.  He wouldn’t say.  They planted him in an orphanage.  A good one, but he couldn’t see that.  All he saw was his mother, every time he closed his eyes.  She didn’t … ***deserve*** this.  She was a good mother.

“Every sleep paw, his dreams dragged him back to that moment, until his dreams started to change.  Instead of watching his mother die, he started fighting, and dying, and dying, and dying, until he stopped dying.  Figured out how to kill the Arxur in his head, ten thousand different ways, but it didn’t bring her back.

“Over time, he realized he had to learn to lift his ears and wag his tail.  To act like everything was fine, when it never was, or he’d get stuck in a PD facility the moment he came of age.  One day, he found out …”

I took a breath.  Grit my teeth.  Tears burnt in my eyes.

“… One paw, he found out that they were using the recording of the worst day of his life to screen people for PD.  They didn’t care to help his mom.  They just helped themselves to her pain, her screams.  Dished them out like tubers on a platter for all to eat.  Screenings across the galaxy use her *dying cries* as an excuse to see prey as predators.  They didn’t *ask* if it was okay, or stop to think if they should.  It *doesn’t belong to them.”*

I scraped away the tears and glared him in the eye.  “The pup is angry.  Always angry, but he doesn’t hate them.  Not really.  The moment he was old enough, he took a job in a space station in the middle of nowhere.  He kept hoping, *praying* to any god who’d listen, that the Arxur would find that station somepaw … *so he could kill them all.”*

They didn’t say anything at first.  A small part of me hoped they’d understand.  The rest of me couldn’t care.  It *knew* they wouldn’t.

I was tired.

“M-Marjinl,” Kampa faltered, “it’s not the herd’s job to save the herd.  That burden falls on the exterminators.”

She stuttered.  I’d made her stutter.  Go figure.

*“You people didn’t help either,”* I hissed.

Scyran mustered his courage as best he could, salvaging the austere image of an exterminator.

“Marjinl, come with me.  We need to screen you,” he declared.

…

I searched his eyes and ears.  No hesitation.  He was going to screen me.  *Heh.*  He was going to screen me, and I was going to let him!  Hah.  *Hahaha …*  **I could tear him apart there and then, but I wouldn’t!  I’d just** ***let*** **him put me through that again, because-!  Because-!**  ***BAAAA’A’A’A’A’A’A’AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA’A’A’A’A!***

Before I knew it, I was braying big, rancorous laughter.  I barely noticed when Scyran pinned me to the ground.

The giant was *laughing.*

He’d anchored himself, feet and tail, arms guarding both belly and face.  Atmospheric blasts pounded his flesh and wool.  Blasts that would be strong enough to pummel a Takkan, but his guard was unbreakable.  Fine.  Now I knew he could take it.

I dialed the B.A.R.C.s to ‘Arxur’ and aimed them both at Brkar.

***FweeeEEEEE …***

Their capacitors *screamed* in harmony.

Sensing the threat, and the opening, he pounced.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I raised an ear.  Screams?  It was hard to hear through the holding room’s door, thick enough to contain the largest species short of Arxur and Mazics.  I raised the other ear.  Listened in silenced.

…

Yes.  Screams.  Getting closer.

I knew I shouldn’t have been happy, and I wasn’t.  Not happy per se.  More like ... *eager.*  Impatient.  To the point where it almost hurt.  Those screams could only mean one thing.

The Arxur had found us.

I strode to the door, stood at the side.  Tapped my tail as the scant scratches passed.  Bit my lip until I tasted orange as it trickled.  Something was in my throat.  Something like a growl.

I could hear it.  They were here.

***FweeeEEEEE …***

Finally, the locking mechanism was blasted away.  A scaly gray foot kicked the door in.  Then followed the snout, sniffing about for me.  The Arxur turned in my direction.

*“Helloooo!”* he sneered, licking his lips.

I pressed the B.A.R.C. to his waist.

*“Goodbye,”* I snarled softly.

# POOOOOOM!

Point blank to the head.

I’d rolled clear when his pounce pounded into the ground, leaving him wide open for the B.A.R.C.s at full power.  At the impact, his wooly mane reared back like a treetop in a killer storm.

On his paws and knees, the giant didn’t move.  His eyes were open, but blank.  He was stunned.

My legs moved before I realized what I was doing.  The next scratch, I found my Hunter’s Spear wool’s length from his eye.  It took everything I had not to blind him there and then.

My translator spoke.  No one had said anything.  No words to interpret, yet it spoke into my brain all the same.

*\~Leash Integrity: 48%\~* it told me.  *\~Cease resistance.  Slay the predator.\~*

*\~What?*  ***Shut up!  I don’t NEED to slay the predator!\~*** I shot back.

*\~Justify your claim,\~* it commanded.

*\~I’ll incapacitate.\~*

I slung myself onto Brkar’s back, snaring my arms around his neck.  The girth of his mane made that difficult, but I found the nook between his chin and his wool.  I squeezed.  Felt the mighty windpipe seize up beneath my arms.

The world whirled.  Black wool eclipsed the light as his mass mashed me to the floor.  The breath fled my lungs.  Back into the light.  I barely tasted air before being crushed again.

He was rolling.  Like the Earth river beast.  A crocodile.

I wouldn’t let go.

The third roll never came.  He surged to his feet and threw himself to the ground back firs-

…

I … sucked a gasp.  A broken rib punished me for it.  I was on the ground, with a sneering giant staring down at me.  He scooped me up like a pup.

“If you wanted-“

He paused, ears angled back.  A sharp jerk and I assume his tail whacked something.  It yelped and I heard a crash across the room.  Apparently, Lmur tried stealth and failed miserably.  He didn’t usually have trouble being sneaky.  I guess the giant was getting used to his tactics.  Brkar continued.

“If you wanted a hug so *bad,”* he purred.  **“You shoulda** ***ASKED!”***

With that, he crushed me.  Another rib gave out instantly.

The Arxur’s fist folded me into the air, blasting the breath from my lungs.

It took paws, but I’d torn through the Arxur’s ranks.  Makeshift weapons and traps were my best herdmates.  I’d been quietly rigging the space station for this since I’d gotten here.  That didn’t stop the outcome.  Everyone else was dead.  Kampa … she’d lasted the longest.  I made sure of that.  The herd needed people like her.  Strong yet kind, but I couldn’t save her.  In the end, it all came down to this.

The final Venlil and the last Arxur.

He’d survived for a reason.  That much was clear.  He was pounding me like crops under heavy hail.  I think he must have been someone important.  An apex predator among apex predators.

I reached for my-

His other fist pounded me to the ground before artificial gravity could pull me down.

I reached for-

His kick almost gored me, sending me rolling into the wall.

I … reached … for my-

***“No more tricks!”*** he roared, raking me off the floor and crushing with both paws.  **“I’m gonna** ***squeeze*** **your bones and innards to pulp and drink them out of your-!”**

I reached my belt.

# ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!

The battery packs unleashed their payload.  The Arxur *screamed* like *sweet, sweet music.*  Damaged as it was, my suit’s insulation only did three fourths of its job.  Electric agony scorched through our bodies.  Even so, I kept my eyes locked on his face, feasting on its deliciously contorting features.  Even as I heard my baying brays meld with his wails.

Brkar was laughing, as though getting flash fried were some kind of inside joke.  He didn’t let go.  Maybe he couldn’t.  His muscles locked around me in spasm, grinding my flesh and bones together.

I could … take it …  a little longer.  Just … a-a-a … litTle … longerr …

His eyes rolled back.

I cut the power.  Shoved and kicked out of his grip.

We fell apart.

The old Venlil stared down at me like a farmer, eying a prize harvest.

“This isn’t a PD facility, is it,” I surmised.

“That it isn’t,” he chuckled.

“So who are you?” I inquired.

“I am The Shepherd,” he declared with a gentlemanly tilt of the ears.  “And *you* are the Venlil who wiped out an Arxur crew, single-pawed.  I surmise that you killed their ghosts for thousands of reruns before the Humans plucked you from that dead space station.”

My gaze narrowed.  “… How did you know?”

“You may be rare, but you are *not* unique,” he declared.  “You relived the battle countless times.  Lived off a crew’s worth of preserved meals and breathed rotting air that reeked of blood.  It was a grisly tomb, yet you resisted when the Humans dragged you out.  Why?”

“… I …”

Why was I even talking to this guy?  I didn’t need to spill my heart to this … whatever he was …  Oh well.  What difference did it make?  Talking felt slightly better than not talking.

“Kampa was there,” I finally answered.  “She was my … friend … she was a good person.  Every time I relived that nightmare, I got to see her again.  Not just her.  There were runs where I saved everyone, you know?  Some runs I sacrificed the few to save the herd.  I’ve been a hero, and a monster, but I got *good* at saving them.  Better than good.  That station was my Heaven and Hell.  I knew it wasn’t real, but …”

He leaned forward.  “So you kept caring about your herdmates amid the pain, the hate?  They weren’t even there.  Explain.”

“Good herdmates *deserve* to be remembered!” I blurted.  “There memories deserve to be fought for!  Everyone is a son, a mother, a father, a daughter, a brother, a lover!  Everyone is someone, even when they’re all alone!  Even when no one remembers them!  There should always be someone there who cares.  Someone fighting for them.  The herd is too weak, too cold, too selfish.  Always there, yet *so far away …* but there should always be someone.”

The words didn’t make sense, but they felt right.

I caught a glimpse and looked up.  The man had a manic grin on his muzzle.  It looked almost Human, but entirely predatory, yet I felt his hearty, heartfelt glee.  Like he’d found some kind of treasure in me.

What exactly did he want with me?

The man strode around the table and gripped my shoulder with a firm paw.  It felt like something a father would do.  The way he did it ... I almost melted.

“Welcome, my dear boy,” he purred.  “Welcome to The Pack.”

*\~All memories, skills and thought processes: unleashed.  Welcome back, sheepdog.\~*

[Sublime clarity washed over me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhfV2TNG3bw)  >!Buried memories of another life came rushing in.  Survival training on high-gravity wild worlds.  Fights to near-death against peers and predators.  Getting stitched back together in stables.  Non-stop fightmares every time I slept, naturally or medically.  Fightmares that taught me a hundred different ways to win the battles that brought me low.  Then, back to battle.  To strive.  To die.  My allies dropped like flies.  Those who remained became something more than Venlil.  Something less.  I remembered Arxur, innumerable.  Sneers, chased from their faces as they looked upon us in unspeakable fear as they realized what we were.  What we could, and *would,* do to them.!<

>!We were the monsters that preyed on predators.!<  And now?  A predator was looming above, reaching down at me with a massive paw.

He blinked.

I moved.

I must have blinked.

My thumb was askew, popped from the joint.  And he was up.  [His strikes climbed my arm like fire chasing gas.](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.bfdd55aaf0129f941bdc494e3e9b79b8?rik=7BvBY%2bQG2izS3g&riu=http%3a%2f%2f31.media.tumblr.com%2ff133029de7a4c47d3916ea0a4e111298%2ftumblr_n55v7kubj51rdsiguo7_400.gif&ehk=cYrPVgmSI2Myb5vpqWDMSRC5lWORwXLo8oaFNkiEVRk%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0)  I knew that feeling.  He’d shut down the nerves.  He was heading for my scars.  Going for the kill.

I pivoted away.  He blurred and ended up in front of me anyway.  Positioned for the killing blow.

My good arm was already moving.  I blocked.  Claws pierced the bullet-resistant hide like a spear.  He flickered.  Too fast for conscious sight or thought.  I moved on instinct to block again.  He kicked my block aside.  *Actually* moved it.  Taken off guard at point blank like this, there was nothing I could do to stop a sheepdog.  Nothing conventional.  It was time for the unconventional.

Shooting from between my legs, my tail arced an uppercut.  He sidestepped.  It followed him.  He backstepped.  The fluffy tip passed before him, eclipsing his vision for a fraction of a scratch.  The back of my fist was behind it.  Closing in. 

Impact. 

He tumbled.  Once.  Righted himself like a cat, claws skimming flooring as he slid.  Through the visor’s tint, his cold, bladed gaze bore into me.

I could feel a new cut on my tail.  When did he even do that?

*So cool.*

I punched my dead arm, kickstarting the nerves.

*\~Okay.*  [*Let’s do this.\~*](https://c.tenor.com/-9FoN19AD-gAAAAC/tenor.gif)

\--------------

A spell of shock befell the passengers as they gawked at the livestream we’d never forget.  Even on scene, Lmur didn’t dare interfere.  He just sort of stood there on the sidelines, watching at a total loss.

The Human lady said something.  I don’t know what it was.  The battle gripped my mind and soul.  There was nothing but the battle.

Brkar and Marjinl.  They weren’t fighting anymore.  They’d *become* the fight: living embodiments of might and motion.  Whirling, blurring.  Blasts and blows.  Strikes streaking back and forth.

Orange spattered.  Glass shattered.  A glancing blow broke Marjinl’s visor.  Any one of Brkar’s punches could have been the end of it, but Marjinl kept going.  He was a whole different creature.  Never winced, never brayed away the pain.  Total focus.  Fatal control.  He fought like a man who forgot the impossible, forgot that he was mortal.  This fight was like a predator.  It devoured everything he hurled at it.  So, he gave it everything.  Everything, and *more.*

I don’t know how, but I followed it all.  Every move, seared to memory.  A thought managed to push through the soil in my hyper-focused mind.

*\~Is this what it looks like when strong Venlil fight?\~*

Marjinl vanished behind a peel of smoke bombs.

***FweeeEEEEE …***

***FweeeEEEEE …***

Brkar’s ears twitched to the cries of the capacitors.  He lunged.  *So fast.*  Tore through the smokescreen like a mythical beast breaching the clouds.  His punches plowed forth.  Marjinl fired.

# POOOOM!

# POOOOM!

Marjinl’s strange weapons pelted their payload.  Fists met blasts.  Shattering impacts.  The shockwave obliterated the smoke.  Windows cracked.  Brkar barely slowed.

My tail went slack.  Did he just … punch through weapon fire?  Not for the first time, I wondered:

*\~How could a Venlil be this strong?\~*

\--------------

**Transcription transposition: Marjinl, Sheepdog**

\--------------

My ears rang.  Vision blurred.  The impact smeared my senses, slurred my minddd ...  This was … a first …

His Hunter’s Spear shot towards me.

*\~It doesn’t … matter how strong he is,\~* I concluded.

I dodged outside it.  Darted in.  His arm shielded me from a clear line of sight.

*\~If it breathes.  If it bleeds …\~*

My paw formed a Hunter’s Spear.  I plunged it at his gut.

***\~I can kill it.\~***

A massive paw wrapped around half my torso, pinning my free arm.  My claws were wool’s length from the kill and could go no further.  His trunk-thick arm had partially shielded me from his sight, but it worked both ways.  I hadn’t seen his other arm coming at all.  So, I began lashing out at the one that seized me.  My attacks barely scuffed the hide.  I kicked and thrashed.  Pulled every trick I knew and then some.  It was a bad angle.  His thumb was in my shoulder joint, robbing half the mobility from my arm.  There was no meaningful way I could attack him at this angle.  He knew it.

Another first.

How odd.  I’d battled all manners of monsters. >! Nightmares that the galaxy wouldn’t, *couldn’t,* know were real.  I’d killed Venlil.  The strongest Venlil,!< yet he was stronger still.  There were giants on our watch list.  Tarlim, for instance.  From what I could gather, he was stronger than this one, but he didn’t have the stamina.  The speed.  The raw instinct and fighting spirit.  This giant was the perfect storm.  *Too* perfect.  It almost seemed as though …

… ah.  That confirmed it.  I’d spotted subtle canines when he grinned.

He wasn’t a Venlil.

The giant pulled back his fist.  In this position of restriction, his punch would snap my neck.  My ears pinned back.

It never came.

He seemed to check himself.  Take a moment to dial out of kill mode.  Then he carefully reached over my head, *just* right so I couldn’t pull a move.  He patted me.

“Thanks for the fight, sheepdog,” he purred.  “It was *delectable.*  Now, be a good boy and *play dead.”*

I finally slipped free of his grip, just a bit.  Just enough to start damaging his arm.

He hurled me.

Rapping my fingernails on the dashboard, I couldn’t help but think.  I had nothing to do but think.  The raps grew louder.

*\~Why am I here?\~* I huffed inwardly.  *\~I’m the heavy hitter.  I should be out there with my team.  Why did I listen to Mar?”*

\---

*“I* ***need*** *you in the squad van,” he’d told me.*

*I’d glared.  “Yeah, no.  I’m the closest we’ve got to the giant’s weight class.  I’m going in there.”*

*“Listen.  I need you in the squad van,” Marjinl emphasized.  “I’ve looked at the floor plans.  There’s only one straightforward exit to Pikro’s Coffee Cradle.  Keep the engine running.  If we need you, you’ll know what to do.”*

*And, like a fool, I’d done nothing as he strode into the establishment alone.*

\---

Sure.  He was squad leader, but that didn’t mean-

A Venlil form exploded through the coffee shop’s glass window, tumbling across the street to crash into a dumpster.  It slumped to the ground.

*Marjinl!*

Raging after him was the giant, intent to finish what he’d started.  He was *just* stepping onto the road.

I didn’t hesitate.

I am a serial cheater, trying mend my relationship with my girlfriend that is married.  
  
I am a cheater...  A serial cheater.  Likely from being emotionally immature and needy.  


I was an emotionally abused husband, but I tried to make it work.  But after too many rounds of ""Do it my way or I will leave you,"" or just being yelled at for being too honest or too nice (I'm the kind of guy that will help a neighbor with carrying groceries, or aid a stranded motorist,) I started to look for positive attention outside of the marriage.  Not good, I know.  I met a nice woman, built an emotional connection, but let it fall away.  She could do better than be my ""Other woman"" and I wanted that for her.

Years later, Marriage finally ended. I came home from work to my soon to be Ex-wife Telling me how she spent money we had been saving up to help buy our first house on >Her< summer vacation plans....

I gave up and started divorce papers.  She moved out in a single weekend, leaving me with all the debts.  I didn't care.  I was free from her abuse and manipulations.  

A few years later, I reconnected with the nice woman, except now she was married with child.  Gotta love social media. I saw her venting on line about not feeling appreciated at home, so I invited her out for coffee.  we talked for hours.  The next month I invited her to my place.  We're both nerdy, so I introduced her to Dr Who.  Then we kissed.  Within a month I was calling her my girl friend and we were getting together whenever we could, well beyond just kissing.

Ten years along.  We are still dating when we can.  She is still married.  Changes in work schedules, Covid, and family obligations made things hard at times, keeping us physically apart.  She's still married.  Her son is growing up, getting through high school.  But I am 4 hours away and frustrated.

Recently, while visiting a nearly life-long friend and his wife, I meet up with the wife's best friend, and old flame from before I was married that never actually dated.  Old habits of flirting reignited and we are sharing spicy messages.  She's married.  I have a GF.  I convince myself that we are just old friends harmlessly having fun with the flirting.  I'm blindly trading going along with it all, even swapping nudes, while sending money to help with her bills.  Just like the good ol' days of way back when.

It doesn't even click in my head that I am emotionally cheating on my girl friend.  I tall my GF about the old friend/flame.  I introduce them to each other.  I even share some of the conversations we have and admit to sending money.  Except, I am head blind.  Like an alcoholic believing he has his drinking under control.

One day, GF is visiting me.  While I am in the shower, she hops on my computer and goes through what was by then  five months of messages, some casual, a lot are spicy.  GF calls me out for cheating.  She's hurt, I feel bad.  She tells me to cut off the old flame.  I do, right there on the spot.

 I am still with my GF.  Old flame is cut off and blocked.  Mutual friends are informed so they know and can stay out of the drama, and so I can be clear that I am not holding a back door open to talk to old flame.  Except my GF still keeps questioning me.

She has mood swings where she remembers the spicy messages she saw.  She asks me if I am sure I want to be with her, if I really love her.  I know I hurt her, I know I betrayed her trust.  And if it had gone on much longer, I would have likely ended up in bed with the old flame.  SO when my GF is upset.  When she is feeling angry and hurt all over again, I accept the fault of what I did, I apologize.  I try to reassure her.

Except I have spent more time apologizing than I spent sending spicy messages.  I know I have a problem, with my history of cheating.  When I was suffering through the later years of my marriage I had slept around, and this is something I admitted to my GF when we started dating. 

My problem is trying to find a way to help my GF move forward, instead of repeatedly rubbing my face in the mess I made.  How do I get her to stop re-opening both hers and mine emotional wounds?  All the while, I am the ""Other man"" waiting for her to decide to cut away from her marriage that she complains to me about.",0,1759673194.0,cheating_stories,0,0.5,False

1nyp2ez,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nyp2ez,I built an AI that does pro model photoshoots in seconds (100x cheaper!) – sharing what I learned.....,"So I've been working last few months on something crazy called [BroadwayCrown](http://broadwaycrown.com), it’s basically an **AI platform that creates professional model photoshoots in seconds** — no cameras, no photographers, no studio.

Why? Because real photoshoots are insanely expensive.  
Like….

* A decent photoshoot for a brand or a model costs anywhere from **$800 to $5000+**,
* Editing adds another **$200–$500**,
* And you still wait **2–7 days** for results.

Meanwhile, AI can generate hundreds of styled, studio-quality shots in **under 60 seconds**.  
At BroadwayCrown, we’re literally doing it at **100x lower cost** (yep, you can get 100+ photos for the price of a coffee ).

But what’s wild is seeing how people use it :

* Fashion startups are using it to **prototype entire product shoots** before even making samples.
* Influencers use it to **create brand collabs** without flying anywhere.
* E-com stores say it **tripled their content output** with same budget.

It kinda feels like how Canva changed design or how ChatGPT changed writing : but now for photography.

We’re just starting out, but I genuinely think **AI photoshoots will replace 80% of traditional shoots** in next 3–5 years.  
If you’ve ever struggled with getting good visuals for your brand, product, or yourself, check it out.

[broadwaycrown](http://broadwaycrown.com/)

Would love to hear your thoughts :  
Do you think **AI photos** will ever *fully* replace real shoots, or nah?",1,1759673027.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

We have people working on our property so I made them a a coffee each morning and helped out where I could. They would mock me for not knowing there lingo and not having knowledge of there field of work. Ok 

Went to the shelter to walk some dogs and the people there made it feel like it was a privilege for me to be there walking their dogs. They were all so rude.

I went and gave some homeless guy some food and money and tried talking to him and every 2 minutes he just kept asking for more money… 

Corporate is no better. Years ago my manager let me get a mortgage knowing the company was about to sell and as soon as I started my first payments he left the team with 1 week notice and we all had to start looking for new jobs 

Not a single person has ever given me a heads up or thank you about anything. We are self employed and financially stable now so I’m very grateful that I don’t have to deal with any more fucked up ego twisted humans. 

God forbid you should be a gypsy in a racist country like me. We are buying a property and I can’t even say a normal thank you in person because it’s owned by a small group of jealous old racist assholes. I have a company making decent money and I’m hiding in the background behind my partner because Im avoiding unnecessary conflict due to my race. 

I’ve learned that most people are just running on greed and ego and that doing random acts of kindness today will instantly get you labeled as an idiot. 

It doesn’t matter how hard you work or what you accomplish. To a racist you will always be a lower class human 

I’m not saying everyone was all hugs and kisses back in the day but I gamed with my neighbours and could talk to a local homeless guy without feeling like I’m talking to a broken record player. 

Humans are now broken NPC’s just running on greed and ego. Good luck out there

**Chapter Thirteen: The Shape of the World**

**Marla Chen** was trained to notice patterns. Not in spreadsheets or surveillance footage. She wasn’t that kind of analyst. But in behavior. Missed appointments. Sudden resignations. Mid-level aides who stopped wearing shoes in the office. That sort of thing.

That’s what had made her useful. Once upon a time.

Now, the people above her had stopped returning emails. The people below her had stopped showing up at all.

She stood at the edge of the reflecting pool in Washington, D.C., coat buttoned to the throat, watching a tourist in a Yale hoodie stoop to pick up a candy wrapper. He didn’t throw it away. Just turned it over in his hands like it might reveal something, like it had a secret worth pausing for. Then he set it gently on a bench, as if placing a baby bird.

Marla didn’t react. She reached into her shoulder bag and pulled out a little brown notebook. The cover was soft at the corners and creased at the spine. The last page had been folded twice.

She clicked her pen and wrote:

***Tues AM / Natl Mall***

*-tourist picked up trash / stared at it / placed gently on bench*

*-no phones out*

*-fewer joggers than usual*

*-several people standing still / eyes closed (not asleep?)*

She paused, chewing lightly on the end of the pen. Then added:

*-general mood = quiet / focused / reverent?*

That morning on the train, a group of teens had leaned their heads together. There hadn’t been a screen among them. No earbuds, no games. One had started humming a low, steady tone. One by one, the others joined in, layering their breath into complimenting tones like tuning forks. The result was strangely calming and yet almost exhilarating at the same time.

Marla, wedged beside the doors with her badge still clipped to her jacket, had watched them with something close to awe. Teenagers. Sitting still. Without being told.

She’d written that down too:

***metro: group hum = spontaneous?***  
*-not disruptive*  
*-seemed peaceful*  
*-nobody complained*

The government screen on the train still flashed the usual public health alerts:

**\*ELM ADVISORY\***  
**wear masks!**  
**report fevers / seizures / rashes!**

But no one on the train was coughing. No one wore a mask, not really. A few clutched them loosely in their hands. One young woman was using hers as a bookmark. It had been days since Marla had heard of a death in the area.

She closed the notebook and slid it back into her bag. Whatever this thing was, it wasn’t ELM. But it wasn’t nothing either. And no one in charge was talking about it.

\--

**In Milan, the protest had begun like any other.**

Placards bobbed above the crowd. They held aloft anti-corporate slogans, hand-painted outrage, reused cardboard softened by past rain. Chants rose in waves, anger braided with exhaustion. Riot police stood in formation at the far end of the square, armored in black, faces hidden behind visors. The heat shimmered between the two groups like tension made visible.

Each side knew the other would surge into violence at the slightest provocation.

A woman in a green scarf stepped forward. The shoulders of the soldiers tightened. Feet braced. Breath held. She didn’t raise her voice. She called three soft, sustained notes that floated into the air like doves released from bondage. Then she stopped.

The silence that followed was startling.

Then someone else picked up the melody. Then another. The sound spread through the crowd like water finding its level.

On the police line, shoulders began to fall. The frontmost officer, a broad-chested man both feared and respected in his battalion, stepped forward. His body lost its tension. His arms dropped to his sides. His knees bent slightly. Head bowed. His fingers released the shield, and with a soft sob, he began to cry. Not from pain but something else. It was regret, maybe. Or recognition. Or joy. The crowd didn’t surge forward. They didn’t cheer. No one took advantage.

Instead, a protestor near the front walked over and handed the officer a bottle of water. He took it, hands trembling, and sat on the cathedral steps like a man who’d walked a long, hard road and finally arrived somewhere he hadn’t known he was going.

They sat side by side.

Other soldiers drifted into the crowd of protestors and embraced them like family returning from war.

No arrests were made. No demands were shouted. People simply stayed. Together. Some sitting. Some humming. Some with eyes closed and faces turned gently toward the light.

\--  
**In rural Alabama, Pastor Graham** stood at the pulpit, sweat collecting beneath his collar. The sanctuary fan spun lazily overhead, stirring paper bulletins and the heavy quiet that had come to define his services lately.

The last three sermons had felt strange. The fire in his voice had faltered. The cadence he once rode like a river now stuttered and stalled. His words had begun to fall into silence and the silences were louder than the scripture.

He scanned the room.

The pews weren’t full, and those who came no longer called out “Amen.” No hands raised. No polite coughs. Just listening. Deep listening. The kind that made him feel like a child again, staring into his grandfather’s eyes to see if he was telling the truth.

He read from Corinthians.

The words landed flat. The wrong words at the wrong time, like pennies dropped into a dry well.

He looked up at the cross behind him. It had once anchored him but now it filled him with more questions than answers.

He realized he had been silent for many long seconds. And he had nothing else to say. So he ended the service with the only prayer he could think of, one he’d learned when he was small:

“Lord in heaven, hear my prayer,  
Keep me in your loving care.  
Be my guide in all I do.  
Bless all those who love me, too. 

Amen.”

It was quiet when he finished.

After the service, he didn’t linger by the door to shake hands. He went to his office and sat. His wife brought him a glass of sweet tea. He accepted it. Then set it down, untouched.

“I think God’s speaking to me different now,” he said.

She didn’t blink. Just nodded, like she’d been waiting for him to say it.

“I think we’re finally listening.”

\---

**They called themselves Firewatch.**

Not officially a militia, of course, just “prepared citizens,” mostly men, a few women, all of them once varsity something. They had been fast in high school, strong in college, and still wore their old letterman jackets in the fall. Some could almost still fit in them.

They met twice a month behind the regional library for “training days,” which usually began with formation drills and ended with brisket. Over time, their obstacle course shrank to four tires and a plank, and their favorite maneuver was what they called a “tactical kneel,” which looked a lot like catching their breath.

When ELM hit, they didn’t panic. They activated.

The camped at an old minesite in the Montana foothills. The ‘bunker’ contained thirty-two men, three women, and two dogs. Solar panel phone chargers, MREs, a cache of outdated night-vision goggles purchased on Ebay were now useful. They christened the place **Camp Sentinel**, took a group photo for the record, and shut the makeshift gate with a ceremony that involved a bugle solo and a vow to rebuild civilization if it fell.

It wasn’t the virus that broke them.

Not directly.

It was the mist.

One of their men had stopped at an adult store in a strip mall by the highway to buy analog porn on the last supply run.  

A woman had been there, offering “protective blessings” in the form of an herbal mist. Peppermint, pine, and something that tempted behind the scent.

He’d said no and laughed in her face, but he’d stood too close when she sprayed it for someone else.

Two weeks later, Firewatch began to unravel.

At first it seemed like stress. There were minor lapses in radio check-ins. One guy forgot the ammo codebook and another left his boots untied. They chalked it up to “op tempo fatigue,” But the next week, three men skipped the morning drill and were found sitting cross-legged in the generator shed, staring at the patterns of the sun through a mesh panel and humming.

The weeping began that night.

Softly, at first. One man curled in his bunk sobbing over a fifth-grade pet he hadn’t thought of in years. The next morning another admitted he didn’t like shooting and had never liked it. He just liked how people looked at him when he carried a rifle.

Leadership called a meeting and tried to rally the group, reminding them of who and what they hated and why. Drumming up the fear and anger that usually pulled them together.

It didn’t work. Even a dubious story of illegal immigrants injecting ELM into white babies failed to get more than an, “Oh, dear, that’s so sad.”

By the end of the week, fourteen remained inside, lying on the floors of the tent they called the rec hall and humming in low, overlapping tones. The rest walked into the woods without announcement, carrying only water, string, and the last of the Italian seasoning blend.

They did not return.

They had been coming into town regularly for donuts and supplies but no one had seen them for weeks, so a local rancher went to check on them. He expected a shootout. Or a graveyard, but all he found was quiet.

The solar array had been carefully dismantled. The food lockers were unlocked and labeled “take what you need.” The armory was intact and stored neatly,  save for one air rifle which was laid across a folded American flag along with a handwritten note that read: *Sorry about the fence post. Tell Dave I said hi.*

In the mess tent, at the center of the long table, stood a half-carved wooden deer. It wore a garland of braided twine and wildflowers. Around its hooves, someone had arranged a ring of peeled carrots and one boiled egg.

On the chalkboard, beneath a crudely drawn sunrise, was a single line:

*We weren’t meant to be gods, just good neighbors.*

\---

**In a quiet neighborhood** outside Seoul, a boy named Min hung wind chimes from every place he could reach.

Plastic ones made from old drink lids which clacked like distant marbles rolling in a drawer. Wooden ones carved from pencil boxes and chopsticks that  knocked softly with the gentle patience of grandfather clocks. One was fashioned from spoon handles and fishing lures which sang in small metallic pings like rain on a tin roof.

He strung them from balconies, porch rails, street signs, and the bent frame of a broken bus stop bench. If he could reach it, it got a chime. If he couldn’t, he stacked crates until he could.

When his teacher found him threading a rusted bottlecap with fishing wire, she asked gently, “Min, what are you doing?”

He didn’t look up.

“I think the air wants to talk,” he said. “And chimes help us hear it.”

That night, just after dusk, the wind came.

First, the breeze nudged the plastic lids and they clicked and clattered like beads shaken in a paper cup.

Then the wood joined in, tapping against itself in soft, syncopated rhythms that made the leaves pause mid-rustle.

Last came the metal: high, clean notes that spun like silver, sharp enough to cut through thought, then ringing out into silence again.

The tones layered and overlapped. \*Clack, knock, chime\*. Then the wind gathered them all at once into a wide, trembling harmony.

The sound wasn’t music, exactly. It sounded like rain in the bamboo mixed with the sound puppies claws make when they run on stones. It sounded like a beaded bracelet on a grandmother’s wrist when she reaches for her first grandchild and sound wet fishing nets make when they drip on the sand. Or maybe they didn’t sound like that at all, but it reminded each person who heard them of forgotten memories and people that were gone and times past.

One by one, windows opened.

Neighbors stepped out in house shoes and blankets. Some cradled mugs of tea that went cold while they listened. Some came with hands tucked in pockets and eyes already damp.

No one spoke. They stood on stoops and sidewalks and leaned against each other like reeds in the same current. Tears rolled down cheeks but no one noticed. The wind quieted after a while. The chimes stilled. No one moved for a long time, not even the children.

Min sat on the curb with his knees pulled to his chest and a tack hammer in his lap. He didn’t smile like a boy who’d finished a project. He smiled like someone who had finally heard what he’d been waiting for.

The next morning, the neighbors didn’t take the chimes down. Even the ones strung across laundry lines or clinking against stair rails were left untouched. A few had tangled overnight, and instead of untying them, people just stood beneath them, heads tilted, listening to how the knots changed the sound.

Min walked the street barefoot, the way he always had. He didn’t speak unless spoken to. And even then, his answers were quiet and strange.

When Mrs. Park, who once ran the neighborhood bakery, asked him how he knew where to hang each chime, he said, “The air tells me where it’s thick.”

When Mr. Hwan, the retired mail carrier, handed him a tin full of spare keys and spoons, Min nodded solemnly and whispered, “These will sound like forgiveness.”

By the end of the week, people had stopped calling him strange. They started calling him the Listener. Not to his face, not exactly. But in whispers, in gratitude.

“The Listener fixed my sleep,” someone said, after a night without nightmares.

“The Listener made my daughter stop crying in her dreams,” said another, who had left a cracked bell on her balcony just in case it helped.

Min didn’t ask for thanks. He didn’t ask for anything. But neighbors began leaving him little gifts: a jar of honey, a handful of jasmine petals, a pair of handmade sandals too big for him now but meant for later. No one asked what would come next. They only waited for the next breeze. And when it came, the chimes lifted again. And everyone listened.

\--

**He fled early.**

Not from illness, since he’d never believed in illness, but from inconvenience, from chaos, from the sound of people asking for things he didn’t want to give. Before the first major lockdowns, before the public figures began coughing on camera, he was already gone.

A Gulfstream jet to a private island and guards with discreet weapons and blank expressions.

He had planned everything.

The bunkers had been dug two years earlier, reinforced with titanium panels and stocked with freeze-dried food, surgical masks, water filters, a backup generator, and an entire pharmacy worth of pharmaceuticals. The island had goats, a greenhouse and a Tesla-branded desalination system.

He’d even purchased a baroque chapel and had it airlifted in from France. The irony of that delighted him. He hadn’t prayed since boarding school but it made for excellent PR during the build phase. His assistant had drafted a press release about ""seeking solitude"" that never got sent.

The guards were loyal. At least, they had been.  For the first two weeks, everything followed protocol. He rotated between workout routines, self-led mindfulness seminars, and private dinners prepared by a personal chef who had once trained in a Michelin-starred kitchen and now made protein powder soufflés.

Then things shifted.

The guards started rising earlier than scheduled. They spent longer on the cliffs, looking out at the sea. One took off her boots and never put them back on. Another began humming tunelessly while polishing the security console.

The chef stopped asking about macros and began serving raw vegetables on ceramic slabs, each plate dusted with crushed herbs and arranged like shrines. She offered no explanation, only a faint smile and a soft, “This is what the food wants to be now.”

He told her to stop. She nodded, and the next day served a dish of uncut mango with a single spoon and a scattering of flower petals. He threw it across the room. She didn’t flinch.

One morning, the pilot refused to start the chopper.

“Winds are wrong,” he said.

“There’s no wind,” the billionaire replied.

The pilot shrugged. “Still wrong.”

By the end of the week, the guards had stopped guarding. They sat at the base of the chapel steps, carving driftwood and watching the horizon. One of them sang low, wordless melodies that made the birds circle closer. The chef wore a necklace of string with knots of dried rosemary and smiled at everyone. The pilot planted an arc of tiny seed of something near the airstrip, in the shape of a constellation.

The billionaire screamed at them. He told them they were fired. He threatened to sue them. He said he would ruin them.

They listened with soft eyes and silence, and then one by one, they walked away.

Left to himself, he paced the bunker, then the chapel, then the helipad. He called old colleagues. No one picked up. He scoured his holdings. Half his servers were down. No one seemed to be stealing anything. No one seemed to want what he had.

On the eighth day of silence, he went to the armory.

He stood alone in the cold, steel-lit room, surrounded by relics of his power. Picked up a rifle. Loaded it with hands that used to sign billion-dollar contracts and took it out to empty island. He fired the rifle once into the empty sky, as if the air might tremble and yield to his will.

It didn’t.

He dropped the weapon and fell to his knees. He said his real name out loud. The name he had carried inside since a child. It echoed in the rafters like something long buried and badly missed.

No one came to arrest him. No one came to cheer. He wasn’t a villain. Not exactly. Just a man who thought he could outlive consequence. Now, he sat beneath the chapel awning, wrapped in the pilot’s old scarf, watching seeds take root in the gravel. The air smelled faintly of thyme. Later, someone would find the island, and the story would grow. But for now, he stayed quiet. He hadn’t cried in thirty years. But today, he did.

\--

**Back in D.C.**, the wind had settled into a warm hush that carried scent more than sound: crushed honeysuckle, concrete after rain, the faint trace of burnt coffee no one had brewed.

Marla Nichols sat on the small balcony of her building’s sixth floor, a wool blanket tucked around her knees and a chipped mug balanced on the railing. Her badge still hung from a lanyard near the door, untouched in days. It could still get her through most government entry points, but fewer and fewer doors opened behind them.

The inbox at her agency terminal hadn’t updated in nearly a week. Internal memos had stopped coming. The emergency coordination thread was silent. She’d sent three emails marked urgent. No replies.

She could still walk through some of the old halls if she wanted. The lights were dimmer now, and most of the elevators hummed but didn’t move. Some stairwells smelled like damp paper and lilacs, which she didn’t question. A former colleague had been sitting cross-legged in the lobby, eyes closed, gently polishing a single doorknob with a handkerchief.

Marla hadn’t interrupted, she’d just logged the observation, nodded, and gone home.

The streets outside weren’t empty. They were full of presence. People sat on benches without phones. Children sketched symbols on the pavement with crushed petals. A man knelt by a planter and whispered something into the ivy.

Nothing was efficient. But everything was alive. Marla opened her notebook, but didn’t write.

Instead, she stared at the last page. It was creased, ink-blotched, filled with small scrawled moments. She looked at them and thought about what her job had once been: noticing what didn’t fit. Flagging the aberrant. Charting the anomalies.

And now? Now everything was an anomaly. And none of it felt wrong.

She looked out over the city, watching as the sunlight bounced off an abandoned office tower and struck the nearby sidewalk like a thrown coin. Someone stopped to pick up the light.

1nyow04,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1nyow04/assess_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_chulux/,Assess the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker CHULUX and See If It Delivers,"Compact, lightweight, and loaded with thoughtful features, the CHULUX CL-CM24002 coffee maker has become an integral part of my mornings. As someone who values both function and style, I was drawn to its sleek design and promise of single-serve convenience. With only 4 inches of width, it easily fits into tight spaces in my small kitchen, while its ability to use K pods for both coffee and tea makes it versatile enough for my ever-changing preferences. I can confidently say it ticks many boxes, but there’s more to evaluate before calling it perfect.

**Sleek Design and Space Efficiency**  
This coffee maker is like a dream for anyone with limited counter space. Its slim 4-inch frame is compact enough to squeeze between my toaster and countertop organizer. Whether in a dorm room, RV, or tiny apartment kitchen like mine, it blends into virtually any setting with ease. Its black finish looks modern and minimalistic. Honestly, when I first set it up, I half expected the smaller size to mean compromise in capacity, but that wasn’t the case. It accommodates travel mugs up to 7.3 inches without the drip tray, which felt like a small victory for my many oversized cups.

**Strong Points**  
- Compact and ultra-slim at just 4 inches wide.  
- Can easily fit mugs of varying sizes without hassle.  
- Modern design, perfect for smaller spaces or minimalist setups.  

**Customize Your Coffee Experience**  
I found myself particularly impressed with how customizable this coffee maker is. It allows you to choose your desired cup size between 6 to 12 ounces, ensuring each cup is tailored to your preference. The 2-inch water fill area makes adding water incredibly simple, even during groggy mornings. One feature that stood out during the first week of use was the machine’s 4-hole needle design. It delivered consistent, richer coffee flavor compared to my old brewer, which often left me with unevenly brewed cups.  

[Check CHULUX CL-CM24002 price on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b0cvxq9bck/)  

**Convenience Meets Performance**  
Brewing with this machine is speedy. The CHULUX coffee maker gets to an ideal brewing temperature of 190°F in just two minutes, which is perfect when I’m rushing to get out the door. I also appreciate the automatic shut-off feature. Once brewing is complete, the machine powers itself down, a small touch that adds both safety and energy efficiency.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited functionality at elevations above 4,000 feet.  
- May require frequent descaling to avoid clogging, especially if water quality in your area isn’t ideal.  

**Versatility in Everyday Use**  
One of this machine’s unique selling points is its compatibility with K pod coffee and tea capsules. Whether it’s a busy weekday morning craving a strong cup of espresso or a weekend afternoon indulging in herbal tea, this brewer handles both with ease. It’s particularly handy for someone like me who enjoys variety and dislikes the idea of multiple appliances cluttering my counter. The removable drip tray also makes cleanup hassle-free, something you’ll only truly appreciate after using coffee machines that turn into a nightmare when it’s time for maintenance.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The water reservoir is relatively small and needs frequent refilling for heavy users.  
- It doesn’t come with a reusable coffee filter option, which felt like a minor oversight for eco-conscious folks.  

**Competing Products**  
Against similar single-serve coffee makers like the Keurig K-Mini or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the CHULUX holds its own by offering better space efficiency and a more budget-friendly price point. The Keurig may boast a larger water reservoir, but its higher cost and bulkier size might make it less appealing for those with tight budgets and minimal counter space. However, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew edges out slightly with a reusable filter option. Still, CHULUX’s unique 4-hole needle design and compact profile make it a strong contender in the single-serve market.

**Smart Spending**  
From my perspective, the CHULUX coffee maker offers great balance between affordability and functionality. While it doesn't have the bells and whistles of high-end machines, it excels at daily brewing without feeling high-maintenance. If you're seeking a coffee-maker that’s reliable, easy to use, and won’t cost a fortune, it’s a solid pick. Many pricier alternatives fail to deliver on efficiency in the way this machine does.

Noong una, literal dream life! Peak ng corporate life, clean streets, high-rise buildings na parang nasa ibang bansa ka. Yung feeling na finally independent ka, naka-dorm, apartment, laging coffee run, laging on-the-go. Life felt so fresh, so exciting. Ang daming bagong friends, bagong memories, bagong simula. Like, “Yes! This is it, I’m finally living the life I prayed for!” ✨

Pero ayun… after a few months (or years), biglang reality check. 😶‍🌫️
Yung city na dati nakakakilig, biglang nakakaburnout. Kahit ang daming tao sa paligid, parang ang empty pa rin. Yung kwarto mo, parang lumalaki at worst pag mag-isa ka na lang (lalo na kung dati may kashare ka). One by one, umaalis mga tropa mo and suddenly, ikaw na lang natira.

Then it hits you: “Wait… san nga ba talaga ako papunta?”
Nakakapagod, nakakalungkot, nakakawala ng gana.
Yung dating promising life, naging loop na lang ng work, kain, tulog, repeat.

At first, she was upset, but eventually she said she understood and agreed it was probably for the best.

Looking back, I realize I was deeply unwell at the time. I’ve struggled for years with emotional regulation and fears of rejection and abandonment. I’m diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I suspect I may also have borderline traits. During our relationship, I wasn’t on medication or in therapy, and by the time we broke up, I was completely dysregulated.

The breakup was impulsive. I still loved her and even remember thinking, “I can’t leave her,” right before forcing myself to do it anyway. I told myself it was necessary for both of us, but the moment it happened, I felt this wave of regret and panic.

We work in the same building. She works in an office, I’m a barista in the café downstairs, which is how we met. After the breakup, she kept ordering coffee like usual but didn’t talk to me. I took that as rejection instead of what it really was: her trying to carry on normally and maintain boundaries.

At the time, I couldn’t see that. My emotions were completely out of control, and I turned my pain into anger. I made everything about me, how I felt ignored or unwanted, instead of recognizing that she had every right to her space.

Eventually, I asked her to avoid the café when I was working. That was wrong. She rightfully told me, “It’s just coffee, it’s not about you.” I took that as her saying I didn’t matter, and I lashed out, saying things I deeply regret, like “If I mean nothing to you anymore, then congratulations.”

Since then, she’s stopped coming altogether. I felt awful and, in a spiral, sent multiple emotional messages apologizing profusely and saying how much I care about her. She only replied once: “It’s okay.” That was six weeks ago. 

I’ve been in a depression ever since. Not because she rejected me, but because I finally see how much harm my behavior caused. I’ve re-entered therapy and restarted medication, and now that I’m more stable, I look back and barely recognize myself. I hurt someone kind and good because I couldn’t manage my own emotions.

It’s hard to sit with the guilt. I still love her and wish I could take it all back, but I know I can’t. The hardest part is knowing she now feels uncomfortable even being in the same space as me and that I created that situation. I’m pretty sure I’m the “crazy ex boyfriend.” ",1,1759672207.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

So I have this friend who sometimes “forgets” her card and asks me to pay for things — usually small stuff like $5 coffees or snacks. She’ll say she’ll Venmo me later but never does. It’s happened a few times now, and I always feel awkward asking for the money back because it’s such a small amount.

But then when I do bring it up, she makes comments like “you really want that $5?” and I end up feeling bad for even asking. The thing is, it’s starting to add up.

She also never offers to split Ubers and always says she doesn’t have the app. Recently, she even asked me to drive her to the airport (which was 45 minutes each way with traffic) and said she’d pay for gas — but she didn’t.

It’s not about the money itself, it’s more about the pattern. I feel taken advantage of but don’t want to seem petty.

I was with my wife for 15 years.  We were married for 10 of those.  When we met, she was pretty open that she had been diagnosed as bipolar.  But she was medicated and regularly attended therapy.   About a year into our relationship, she became pregnant.  She had to stop the meds and stopped going to therapy for one reason or another.  Things changed almost immediately.  She was far more emotional, erratic, and prone to irrational outbursts.  She came into the relationship with two daughters that I immediately became attached to.  Naively I thought things would get better.  Even before we got married, I discovered she had been having some sort of relationship with a male coworker.  I could prove they had gone out together.  I could prove they shared a hotel room together.  Yet she adamantly denied things ever became physical.  No I never believed her and for reasons I still don’t understand I married her anyway.  The next 10 years was a roller coaster.  Constantly walking on egg shells.  Managing one episode after another trying to think of the right things to say and do.  Irrational outbursts.  Small things absolutely setting her off and becoming weekend-long fights. Being thrown out of my own home because the pots and pans weren’t put away correctly.  Even though I was the only one that ever did dishes.  The coffee wasn’t made for her one morning so that means I’m an inconsiderate piece of garbage.  Yelling at the kids for no reason and then threatening divorce if I even hinted at taking their side. After 10 straight years of dealing with this, I just got exhausted and stopped putting forth the same amount of effort.  Countless conversations.  Countless fights.  Countless tears.  Then I came home early one day without telling her, and caught her in the act with another man.  It had been going on for 2 years.  According to her it was my fault for not being a better husband, making her feel wanted, etc.  And she might be correct but it wasn’t for a lack of trying.  After dealing with the emotional and mental abuse, I just didn’t have anything left to offer.  I firmly believe that, while I admit I’m not completely blameless in the downfall of our relationship, that BP is to blame.  Without BP, I don’t think she ever would have made the decisions she made.  For the last year, I’ve battled severe depression and PTSD.  I’ve attempted to end my life 2 times.  The pills didn’t work.  The gun wasn’t loaded (I thought it was).  I joined the dating apps and slept with anyone that was willing.  I was doing anything I could to validate myself or fill the void.  I did not want to live anymore.  Even for the kids.  They would’ve been better off without me I thought.  About 3 months ago, I met a woman on one of the apps.  I thought maybe it would just be another hookup at best.  When I tell you that I fell in love with her immediately, I mean it.  I’ve been in love (I thought.). I’ve had crushes or been infatuated.  This wasn’t that.  I’m in my 40s.  I’m not dumb or naive.  This woman checked all my boxes and was just as into me as I was into her.  Every day since we met has been better than the one before.  She literally saved me.  I know it’s new, and there’s trauma-bonding etc but we’ve spoken openly and honestly about all of it and I believe in my heart and soul that she is my person.  We are perfect together.   Things can and will get better.  If you’re with a BP partner, and they’re not being treated, insist they seek help, medication, therapy, etc.  An untreated BP partner will likely lead to pain and heartbreak.

The whole modern process of meeting someone feels a bit like a job interview for a position you're not even sure you want. There’s the pre-interview screening, which is the texting, and then there's the formal sit-down across a table under lights that are always too bright, where you both present optimized, slightly fictionalized versions of yourselves. It’s a whole production. And the sheer exhaustion of it all, the psychic weight of performing your own personality, makes me want to just stay home and watch documentaries about how bridges are built.

So I have an alternative theory for a first meeting. A kind of anti-interview.

Option A is the Pet Cafe Gambit. Think about the strategic genius of this. The pressure is immediately diffused. It’s not just you and me, locked in a conversational tractor beam. It’s you, me, and a dozen or so creatures whose entire life philosophy is to find a sunbeam and sleep in it. There can be no awkward silences, because we can just turn our attention to a puppy trying to figure out a chew toy or a cat that has decided your bag is its new ancestral home. The social burden is shared with the animals. We can talk about them. We can have a perfectly good time without ever having to ask the dreaded, ""So, what do you do?"" question until at least the second cup of coffee. It’s a buffer. A very cute, furry buffer against social anxiety.

Option B is the Juhu Beach Meander. This is a different but equally valid approach. Here, the pressure is relieved not by animals, but by motion and chaos. We wouldn't be sitting face to face, which is a fundamentally confrontational posture. We would be walking side by side, looking at the same things. The weirdly competitive kite flyers, the person selling channa jor garam or the stall selling naryal pani with an almost religious intensity, the horizon which seems both endless and somehow just out of reach. We're not performing for each other, we're just two people observing the general, magnificent absurdity of a Mumbai evening. The conversation can come and go. It doesn't have to be a constant stream. We can just walk, and breathe in the salty air, and maybe have a shared opinion about the quality of the sand.

A little about the person writing this: I read books, sometimes finishing them. I listen to podcasts that are probably too long. My attempts at DIY home repair usually end with me having three extra screws, a slightly more broken appliance, and a deep philosophical respect for people who actually know how to use a wrench. I think I'm a decent person with a healthy appreciation for the ridiculous.

If any of this rambling resonates with the part of your brain that is also a bit tired of the usual script, send a message. We can see if we're on the same page, or at least in the same chapter.",1,1759671790.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

it all starts back in feb 2024, i was standing near the water cooler in our corridor and i see 3 guys walking at a distance and he immediately caught my eye. he was the tallest, wearing a shirt, glasses. idk how to explain this but he looked really nerdy. and i remember saying to my friend, ""oye voh dekh cute ladka"" (i NEVERA call guys cute). i was in 11th at the time, session khatam hone wala tha since it was 11th. now there's the thing, the hallway he was coming from was where our seniors were having their tests and all so i thought ki he's a senior and blah blah. and i forget about him.

more than a month later, my 12th batch started and on my second day, i was sitting awkwardly with some girl didn't know and pure time i was just looking idhar udhar because merese nahi hoti conversation start. so that goes on for 10 mins and suddenly BOOM. i see him walk in. mera dimaag went ""ABEY YE TOH WATER COOLER HAI"" and even crazier when he sat on the desk right next to me. this whole time i was thinking he was a senior BUT HE WASN'T. and wdym out of all the 11 batches usko mere he batch me hona tha.

this was the ending of march. iske baad se things just...idk. ill explain. we would coincidentally wear the exact same things. me and my 2 friend which i eventually made would ALWAYS sit behind him and his friends. default setting. we never really talked but hamara eye contact and all hota tha. then there was a time where we used to bump into each other alot in the corridor. apne aap. my friends were not even pushing me. this one time, we had a test and i was sitting with some girl and teacher ne usko uthaya and made HIM sit with me.

then. on 4 june 2024, we sat together in class. im not getting in details cuz fir ye bohot lamba ho jayega. but in short, we still haven't talked properly, we followed each other on insta but NO TALKING. but anyways, we sat sath me in one class (mere dosto ne mera bag uske desk par fek diya tha🥀) AND OMG. let me tell you what happened. he started the conversation. like 4 baar. he was asking me something or the other and i was like ""YE MUJHE JANTA HAI????"" ""HOW DOES HE KNOW MY NAME"". i was having a borderline panic attack because i was so nervous. AND LIKE i had never seen him talk so much. he's a REALLY QUIET GUY. so mai toh pagal hogayi ekdum. 

uske baad. 6 june 2024. 5th ko coaching me off tha. and 6th ko so much happened. his friends were looking at me. i think 4th ko bohot zyada obvious hogaya tha that i REALLY liked him. can't even blame him. i malfunctioned infront of him😛.

okay now fast forward, june july and mid august were pure chaos. idk how it got so messy. but i would like to believe he didn't like me back. all of his friends knew that i liked him (apparently). corridor me i would be walking and his friends would be looking. and like all the small things which i dont even remember because its been more than a year.

so i was like, pasand toh ye karta hai nahi so ab kya he kar sakte hai. then ending of august me i was talking someone else and he started dating someone too. kya mere dil me dard hua when i saw him getting coffee for her in the canteen? yes. did we accidentally make eye contact when he was walking with her? yes. did that make me want to kms a little? yes.

but then nothing happened. and he stopped coming to coaching september ke baad. and dheere dheere because I didn't see him irl, i thought ki haan hogaya ab. atleast i have crazy lore about the first guy i ever liked. and aise ge 12th khatam. neet ki test series bhi khatam. i didn't see him anywhere.

that was until june 29. i had an exam for some local university and koi random college was the centre. exam khatam hone ke baad u was waiting for a friend by the gate for 15 mins and voh ayi he nahi. mai bhi thak gayi thi so i thought ki chalo ghar chalte hai and bina dekhe i turned around and BOOM. i was like 2 cms from bumping into someone. but fir i freeze. like. i didn't even see his face. just his thodi si side profile for 0.1 sec and im like ""fuck it's him"" and meri fat gayi. do i just left and went home. ghar aake maine apne dosto ko ye sunaya and we all lost our minds sath me.

I WAS VALID CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT I ""SAW"" HIM AFTWR 9 MONTHS AND OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE MUJHE USSE HE TAKRANA THA. also this was the place i was least expected to see him. crazy na?",2,1759671579.0,TeenIndia,44,1.0,False
1nyohf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IFchildfree/comments/1nyohf3/the_social_media_game/,The social media game,"A couple of days ago, a former colleague and friend posted her pregnancy announcement to Instagram. I wouldn’t describe us as close friends - she lives several states away - but we stay in casual contact on social media and usually try to get coffee when she is in town. A couple of years earlier, we had discussed our shared fertility struggles over brunch - I was going to be starting my first round of IVF and she had just had another failed IUI.

I had thought about her a few times since ending my fertility journey in July. We hadn’t discussed our parallel journeys since that brunch and as we are similar ages I wondered if she had also made a similar decision. Subconsciously, I decided that she must have and had mentally added her to my little running list of “safe people”. I enjoyed viewing her posts of her travels and what was going on in her life. It made me happy to see people who were also childfree and enjoying their lives. 

I saw the announcement, sighed, and quickly hit “mute” in the settings of our connection (but not before sending her a note to tell her how happy I was for her - this is genuine). I briefly mourned that I’d have to close the window into her life - for now anyway - to preserve myself. I mentally scratched her off my safe list.

It was the second “muting” of the month - the first was another former colleague who had very publicly shared the challenges of her years long struggles with IVF. She was the person who made me realize how unsafe being around the active IVF community still was for me - I somehow felt more betrayed by their successes. I resented her for (rightfully and bravely) sharing her struggles in the pursuit of community support to then turn around and so publicly declare her membership to the club of motherhood. It seemed like it was only safe to talk about IVF when the outcome was success. People don’t want to hear that this outcome is in fact not a guarantee.

Neither announcement ruined my day or sent me into a complete spiral - I was (am) happy for both women. Muting them is the best action I can take in preservation of my own spirit right now. But it’s an odd thing - to keep casual community with people for over a decade and then change the proverbial channel when the content no longer serves you.

So here’s how it works in my schizophrenic brain.

You control SKK in third person. You walk around the Elmo and interact with the dolls.

You walk up to Springfield, Klukai, or Groza, and they say some generic line like “I’ve compiled reports about something something, and it’s on your table.”

Reissi doesn’t stay in one spot. She teleports randomly to wherever SKK is, and if you interact with her, she offers you a snack or a cup of coffee. She’s like an SCP entity.

Zhao drops on you from the ceiling and throws out a dad joke like “I told my wife she should embrace her mistakes. She gave me a hug.” After an awkward pause, she jumps back to the ceiling using her rope thing. No, you don’t get to move the camera to look up.

Krolik and Nemesis are always together, and whenever you see them, they’re arguing.

Suomi runs around blasting her bubble gun, with Vepley and Yoohee chasing her, while dancing.

Andoris walks around and then suddenly crashes and you need to manually reboot her..

Jiangyu and Faye jump around fighting each other.

Mechty sleeps in random spots. And I mean absolutely random spots.

The pathfinding sometimes glitches, so the dolls end up walking into walls nonstop.

There’s also a dormitory area where you see a bunch of doors leading to each doll’s room. The doors are decorated to match each doll’s personality.

Also a huge vehicle storage room. 

Also a huge kitchen. 

And a pool... 


It will absolutely work just like I imagined it. Most definitely… 100%.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

I (21F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been together for almost a year now. We started as a long distance and we still are long distance (only 2.5hrs away from each other) but we try to meet once a month for a few days. We have been having some issues lately.

He met a girl in his internship, let’s call her D, that he told me they get along well. But the only thing he told me about her and the other girls he met there is that they have a “work relationship”, only professional. When his internship was about to end, he said he might go out for a drink with D, cause she wanted to say goodbye to him. She was leaving for the summer to work. That was really weird for me and I truly believe that you have no right to do something like that for someone you know only for two months and you had a “work relationship” with. Apparently he was getting close with her, more than the work thing.

I was not okay with him going and I told him that. He also told D that she can text him whenever she wants, which I also found weird. We agreed that he will not go but if he wants to continue having her as a friend that I wanted to meet her. He was okay with that.

After a while, his internship ended and they had a dinner with all the people he worked with. Side note, his internship was in a school, the dinner was for the teachers but they also invited the interns. There were three girls and my boyfriend. The two girls couldn’t go to the dinner, only my boyfriend and D would go. After that dinner he told her to never text him again cause his girlfriend was not okay with it. That’s what he told her.

The summer passes, after he told me what happened I didn’t bring it up again. August 15th was his name day, that girl messaged him. He replied. And they continued talking until September 11th. The whole time they were messaging he didn’t tell me anything. And I didn’t even consider that he might be talking with her behind my back.

September 11th he comes to visit me. We spend 5 days together. September 15th, the day he was going to leave, I noticed him being overprotective with his phone, panicking when I took it to take pictures, taking it with him when he went to the bathroom etc. I told him I feel like he is hiding something and also mentioned the reasons. He said that he isn’t hiding anything, that it’s all in my head and he laid his head on my shoulder saying he felt dizzy.

About one and a half hour before his bus left, we sat at a coffee shop near the bus station. He told me “I have to tell you something.” And after that phrase I felt my heart drop. He said that D texted him happy name day and he said thanks and then she took the excuse to keep texting him and she sent about a book shop that closed. He told me I can check. I took his phone and saw way more messages than what he told me.

I started crying, I felt betrayed. I felt broken. After a lot of crying from both of us he said he won’t reply to her again. But my trust broke. The first few days he seemed understanding — saying sorry and that he wants to fix this together. After a while though I was to blame for holding on to the past and not moving on.

I wanted to ask him everyday if she texted him but after a few days he said it hurts him so I stopped doing that. It still hurts, I don’t trust him anymore the way I trusted him and every time I ask him if he talked with any of his girl friends or if when he goes out if there’s going to be a girl there, he attacks me.

Today he told me that he and one of his friends from uni are going for coffee. I asked him if there is going to be just the two of them and he said “great, talk to you in an hour.” He made me feel like the worst person for asking such a simple question and then he said that next time he will make sure to have other company, meaning he will go out with his girl friend. Which felt like revenge.

**TL;DR:**  
My boyfriend and I are in a long-distance relationship. He got close with a girl (D) during his internship, said it was just work-related, but later texted her behind my back after promising not to. When I found out, I felt betrayed and lost trust. Now, whenever I ask simple questions about who he’s with, he gets defensive or turns it around on me, making me feel guilty — even though I’m still hurt and struggling to trust him again.",2,1759671423.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Like many, I believe it was a combination of many things including severe stress and they also found some bacteria in my urine during onset.

A few days ago, someone else posted their success story in here, and among the items they listed that they cut out to heal, one of them they mentioned was creatine. I did a search in the page and found two more people who seemed convinced creatine was a factor in their prostatitis.

I have taken creatine for a few years, but I would always take breaks. This past year, I fell prey to a lot of content out there that touted creatine as a daily supplement you can take without breaks. I did do research during this and couldn’t find anything relating creatine to prostatitis, until I searched this group.

For the past month, I have been stuck at the “I’m 95% healed” level I’ve seen many others in here get to. It was getting frustrating that I couldn’t get all the way to 100%. I cut out creatine a few days ago and now I am actually 100% healed. I even enjoyed a cup of half-caf coffee this morning to celebrate, my first cup of coffee in about 5 months.

Putting this post in here because there might be another person like me down the road who is taking this supplement and not realizing it could be affecting them in this way. I know it probably feels dumb I didn’t try to cut it out sooner, but creatine is really being pushed hard as a safe, daily supplement right now. I don’t think that’s the case for everyone. I also feel it was giving me some tendinitis as well.

1nyo4uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1nyo4uz/how_to_get_into_a_specialty_coffee_shop/,How to get into a specialty coffee shop?,"Hi everyone. 

This question is not exactly about coffee, but about working with it. I’ve been working as a barista for about 2 years, which is actually not that little. I started, like many others, in regular coffee shops where they make ordinary coffee. There I was able to get my first experience working with the coffee machine and with customers.

Now I still work in a chain place, but they roast their own coffee and call themselves a “specialty segment.” I really want to dive into coffee on a more professional level, but after some unsuccessful attempts to get into a specialty shop, I get the feeling that it’s almost impossible. I either get rejected at the résumé stage, where they tell me “we don’t have any open positions,” or after a trial day they thank me and promise to contact me later, after which they disappear without even saying the reason.

What am I doing wrong? Those who work in specialty coffee shops, could you please give me some advice on how to behave better to get the job?

I was recently finally invited to a trial day. I really need your advice.
By the way, I live in Germany.

Thanks in advance for your answers.",0,1759670660.0,barista,0,0.5,False

Recently, I’ve been rediscovering analog hobbies like sketching, playing vinyl records, and even building simple wood projects.

It made me wonder: what non-tech hobbies have you all picked up or returned to recently? Whether it’s knitting, gardening, brewing your own coffee, or something else that doesn’t require a charger or Wifi.

Personally, I’ve found that stepping away from tech even for just an hour or two really helps with mental clarity and stress relief. Also, there’s something so satisfying about making something with your hands, right?

1nyo2yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nyo2yj/aita_for_not_paying_attention_to_my_bf/,AITA for not paying attention to my bf,"Last week my boyfriend and I went on a vacation trip to San Diego to celebrate his 28th birthday. He booked the trip, secured the Airbnb with an ocean view. On our first day we were tired from the flight so we went out to town and got something to eat and went back to the Airbnb. The next day we had planned on heading into the city and going around local shops. I typically drink coffee in the mornings so I had mentioned how I brought the coffee but not the creamer. He then offered to go on a quick grocery run to get creamer and come back and leave to the city. We did the grocery run, I made coffee, all done and we left in the car. He kept pointing things out throughout the drive and I said “that’s cute”, or “nice!”. Once we got to the city we had breakfast and then split to explore the local shops. He kept sending me pics of things he thought I would like and I shopped around for my girlfriends back home. I didn’t see anything that reminded me of him. I ended up getting my girls a gift each and one for myself. We then walked every store together after that and got drinks. Once we got to our airbnb he wanted to read and I wanted to rest. So we did that. When I woke up from my nap he was leaving the pool as I was getting in. Then he came back down a few moments later and we began talking. Later that night he wanted to watch a movie so we picked “Hush.” I had never seen it, but I also wanted to knit for a bit while watching the movie. To which he paused the movie and went to the other room to get something. He was taking too long so I went after him. I found him reading by the window and I asked what was wrong. And he looked at me and said “You’re doing what you want to do, and I’m doing what I want to do.” It was the way he said it that ticked me off and made my heart race. So as collected as I could, I asked him to talk to me, and he kept saying the same thing. We went back and forth until I threw my knitting tools in my suitcase and I told him to tell me at once what the problem was. To which he then said; “Since we got here you’ve done but text your friends and your mom and tell them how much fun you’re having. You’ve been taking selfies and not a single pic with me or a candid of me. And it really hurt when you said you couldn’t get dinner two weeks ago and now you’re buying your friends gifts and spending money on yourself. This trip is about ME, because is my birthday and I booked it regardless of whether you could come or not. If you weren’t here I wouldn’t be watching Hush, I’ve seen it, I’d be doing other things. You’re the shitty boyfriend in all those reels. You only care about yourself and that’s because you never had an adult relationship. Don’t take it to heart but you’ve doing what you wanna do, not what I wanna do.” I then apologized and didn’t think much of it. We watched the movie, laughed, cuddled, went to sleep and that’s it. I couldn’t help but think, am I the asshole for not making him the center of attention?

We had a pretty chill connection at first , lots of sarcastic jokes, some flirty banter, similar taste in music. We ended up going out twice,first for drinks, second time for dinner. Nothing crazy, but we got along well enough that I thought a third date was likely.

Then… radio silence. She stopped replying after a few short texts, and I didn’t want to be *that guy* who keeps double texting. A few days turned into a week, then two. I figured she just lost interest and didn’t owe me an explanation that’s dating apps for you. So I moved on, unmatched her, and started talking to someone else.

Fast forward to last week , she suddenly texts me again out of nowhere, like nothing ever happened. Her message literally started with “Hey stranger ” followed by “I wasn’t ready before, but I’ve been thinking about you. Want to grab coffee?”I was surprised, but polite. I told her I appreciated the message but I’d started seeing someone new and didn’t think it would be fair to anyone to pick things back up.

That’s when she flipped. Within minutes she sent like 6 messages in a row, calling me “selfish,” “pathetic,” and saying I was “just another guy playing games.” She said I was lying about seeing someone and I just wanted to feel like the good guy...

I tried to keep it calm and replied once“I don’t want this to get ugly. I really wish you the best.”She didn’t respond right away, but an hour later I got one last text that said""You’ll regret ghosting me""Then she blocked me.

I honestly didn’t think I did anything wrong, but the sudden switch from flirty to hostile really threw me off. It’s been sitting in the back of my head , like did I handle this too bluntly? Or am I overreacting for feeling uneasy about how quickly her tone turned?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I've been wanting to get an espresso setup for a while, and I've got a budget of around 2K Canadian. I'd be new to espresso from a workflow perspective, but understand the science and concept faily well. So I've got 2 setups in mind, based on what ive been seeing on here over thr past few weeks and ive love for your input, based on what ive mentioned above. 

Setup 1:
Breville bambino plus
Baratza encore esp

Or 

Setup 2:
Profitec go
DF64 

I'm def leaning setup 2, I really like the idea of a PID, especially since I love light roasts. I'd only be making milk based drinks for my wife (occasionally) and maybe when we have people over. 

Let me know what you all think, please and thank you! ",3,1759669992.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1nynu82,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeInsurance/comments/1nynu82/experience_with_nasb/,EXPERIENCE WITH NASB,"I joined NASB the beginning of the year, looking for a change in career. At first, I really did enjoy selling policies. I happened to be good at it. And then of course the ugly happened these people don’t tell you how much it is to start up. I “invested” in myself & bought everything they wanted to me to buy, iPad,  Apple Pencil, leads, courses, apps that costs hundreds of dollars a month, etc etc. I would have weeks where I made 5-6k, because of the 9month advance you get from carriers. HOWEVER what they don’t tell you is the chargebacks. Every month I was paying nearly 4k a month just for the debt! $1500 a WEEK for leads that have been reused over and over, plus gas & maintenance on my car (you drive ALOT), coffee culture events that were out of town, I mean you NAME IT. Everything is out of pocket.  I damn near lost EVERYTHING. Actually, I did ended up having one of my cars repoed because I was paying roughly almost 10k a month with them plus my bills. It ruined me financially, also my credit. Even after leaving, any charge backs fall on me, which I can’t pay because I’m still rebuilding myself from the damage that caused me. Not only that nobody talks about the MENTAL damage. They encourage you to push push push, push through the pain. Wave a gold carrot in your face, showing the trips the partners in the company take every day while they yell at you on the phone every morning telling your that your not doing enough, it’s not that they care it’s because YOUR the reason they can live lavishly. They brag about making $2.5 million a year. They make that because you sacrifice your time, your freedom. They try to sell you the job by saying you get freedom because you can work whenever you want, trust me yall that is a LIE. You want to be good at it? You’re working from 9AM-11PM most days! If your out for a couple days they make you feel bad about it because “your not doing enough, we don’t work part time” blah blah blah THE LIST GOES ON. They try to motivate you by giving you these weak ass motivational quotes that make no sense what so ever, they are ALWAYS in left field. They remind me of those FOREX people with their conferences & motivational “talks”, It does take a toll on you mentally because your going to a stranger home they don’t KNOW you, you can easily be HARMED. I know agents who had literal guns pulled out on them. You have no idea who’s door your knocking on & what’s going on in there. I’ve seen the NASTIEST houses that can take a toll on your mental too.

1nynu3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/HipImpingement/comments/1nynu3o/35_weeks_post_op_struggling_to_differentiate_pain/,3.5 weeks post op struggling to differentiate pain,"I’m 3.5 weeks out from surgery and now full weight bearing in small increments, mostly at home. Things have gone pretty well so far, I was cleared to come off crutches at 2 weeks, started PT and was told my strength is good (I exercised a lot prior to surgery) and things were feeling better than I had expected. For exercises I’m mainly activating muscles gently squeezing yoga blocks and pushing out with a strap around my thighs. Otherwise my sessions in PT are manual massage which feels great. 

Last week I started going back into the office where I work for just a few hours (my goal was between 2-4 depending on how I felt). I have a desk job, so I set timers to move either from sitting to standing, or just to get up and get coffee, ways to loosen things up so o didn’t feel pain. It worked week for two mornings (I came home after each day and worked from bed with my ice machine to recover) but by the third day I started experiencing sharp pains up my quad, into my inner groin and hip flexor. I hadn’t had sharp pains like this before so I was concerned. Went back to my PT and let the orth know and both said to take it easy but didn’t seem concerned. I pulled back and spent Friday fully remote to try to recover. 

I guess this is more of a rant, but I’m struggling with understanding what pain is normally versus not normal, when I should stop what I’m doing and fully lay down with ice and go home, versus normal aches and pains. I feel like I’m being careful, keeping my outings short, abiding by restrictions and taking things slow, but still experiencing setbacks and the mental tax of that is getting to me. I know it isn’t a linear process, but I’m finding myself anxious going into this next week. How do I not worry too much about every little feeling? And how do I know when a pain is worse than it should be? This group has brought me lots of comfort, just looking for some reassurance.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nynrjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nynrjy/there_is_something_evil_in_the_scottish_highlands/,There is something evil in the Scottish highlands,"Life has not been good to me, and when it has, it's only been so I get a taste of happiness before it cruelly rips it away from me. I once worked hard and I once had a family. I was even once loved but a combination of alcoholism, lust and the abuse of amphetamines destroyed any semblance of a normal life I had. What do you do when you are a 27 year old deadbeat dad with an alcohol problem and no backbone? You run away.  I walk and I walk. I walk until the soles of my feet ache, I walk until the straps of my oversized backpack dig into my shoulders and the weight is so heavy that I am forced to stop every 15 minutes to sit and take in the beautiful views around me. They were beautiful, the views. Hiking is not easy but that is why I do it, you are in a situation where you have to be present, made to be aware of the blister forming on your left heel, made to be aware of how much water you have or how little and made to be aware that back home is not as hard as you think it is. Although your pride will not let you return.  

​Sometimes you are 20 miles away from any town and you have to decide if you stop and set up camp now with only half a jar of peanut butter and instant noodles you cannot cook because your stove broke, or do you keep walking and get to the nearest town by 6pm. Book a hostel and collect your strength for the morning and continue on. Well I kept on walking. Left foot, right foot. Walking through the beautiful Highland landscapes made from the same mountain range as the Appalachians many thousands of years ago. It is interesting how you can be made of the same “stuff” but end up so different because of your environment. I am sure someone much more intelligent than me could say something profound about this. Left foot right foot. I listen to Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan sing of a hobo's travels and I think of how all men have the urge to just wander and live along the tracks. I think of going home and cuddling up in bed with my ex-partner. I think of a warm bath. I hope my hostel has a bath. Left foot right foot. I finally make it to the hostel, I devour the complementary shortbread and drink all the free coffee and tea in my room. I close my eyes to sleep. Rest does not find me. I am cold, so fucking cold the type of cold that reaches your bones, where no amount of blankets can exorcise the chill from your core. There are no blankets though, I am on the bank of a loch soaked in the dew of the grass I lay in. The moon is full, illuminating the clearing entirely. Wind thrashes the bare skeletal branches of the frìth behind me. As I turn my head back to the loch wondering how I got here, I see her. A beautiful woman emerge from the water. The water is maybe up to her waist, although she is completely naked, she does not seem to be bothered by the cold. Her titian hair is draped over her chest but it is her eyes that have me transfixed. I cannot make out what colour they are due to the darkness but I find myself lost in them. She is in front of me now, I do not know how she got so close in so little time. It is as if the space between us was warped, folded in on itself to bring me closer to her. Her lips are half an inch from my face now. I can see her eyes now, they have no colour. They are not black but colourless, I  can smell her now too, she smells of hay and algae like a barn after a rain storm. I am shaking now, I don't know if it's from the cold or from fear. I awake in my hostel bed soaked from sweat, I do not dream, I have not dreamt for years. If I knew giving up whiskey as a sleep aid would result in nightmares like that I probably would have reconsidered giving it up.

I forgo the bath for a shower, the thought of stepping in any body of water fills me with dread. I go to a local café and order a full Scottish with double everything, double sausages, double bacon, two black puddings and double haggis, of course. While I eat everything on my plate other than the mushrooms. There is a man at the other table and I have had no human contact for several hours. Other than the mournful cowboy ballads playing in my ear and whatever invaded my sleep last night, I decided to engage him in conversation. He tells me how his father in-law passed and how he is there to clear out the croft his wife's father owned. I tell of my achievements, I tell him of my children and how I bought a house at 20, I neglect to tell him how I abandoned them and left their mother to pay a mortgage on her own. Me and the man who sat across from me clearly came from different economic backgrounds, him an upperclass farmer and I the son of two addicts. The man says goodbye and I wished him luck, empathising with how hard it is to dig through memories, he gives me a knowing smile and whispers something to the cafe owner then leaves. I hope he is doing well. I found out he paid for my breakfast when I presented my cash to the woman behind the till. I am not one to accept charity so I seek out where I can find this man under the guise of saying thank you. Unfortunately no one in the cafe knew the man. I asked an elderly couple who occupied the table by the window if they knew where the croft he was clearing out could be located. The husband replied “The only one I can think of is Campbells. I don't advise you to go there pal.” I asked him why, his wife grips his hand on the table before chiming in “It is not safe, the roof is.. bowing. P-plus you don't want to get lost up there.” I open my mouth to protest but the woman's husband shuts me down demanding I leave them to have their breakfast in peace. 



I leave the café honestly feeling a bit creeped out, I have been on edge all morning and I really don't need some teuchters giving me the fear over a stupid croft. I try to look up Campbell croft but I only find a website about some place in Vermont and a Wikipedia page about the massacre of Glencoe. I am nowhere near Glencoe and I am definitely not near Vermont. So with no place to go but anywhere I follow the cobbled street of the town north until they turn to tarmac. The town, if it's even fair to call it that, only spanned a few miles. The high street quickly turned to a spattering of houses that got sparser and sparser. I now walked through a dense forest that was parted by this country road that's flanked by ancient looking drystane dykes, occasionally punctuated by the odd cottage or construction plot. As the early morning faded into the afternoon I found my mind wandering, thinking about all my misdeeds and the people I have let down over the years. I see her in my mind's eye, the woman from the loch and the thought of her gives me chills. I am almost out of water so I keep an eye out for a stream and I make sure I am listening for running water. The drystane dykes become more and more decayed as I follow this path, several stones missing from these mortarless walls. I hear water running in the distance, I quicken my pace slightly as much as my legs would allow me with this backpack bearing down on me. There it is, a fountain in the wall. There is an iron gate to the right of the fountain leading to the other side of the wall. The fountain is ornate made from copper that is green and oxidised from years of being exposed to the elements but above it is a silver icon of the Mother Mary holding the baby Jesus in her arms. The Icon was large, maybe a foot tall and a foot wide, the carving was extremely detailed; it looked like Mary was staring right into my soul. I looked at the ground as I filled my water bottles suddenly filled with shame. I was eager to get out of there as soon as possible but my curiosity made me open that gate, it made me step inside of the kirkyard and gaze upon the small granite church that sat there, its red arched door opened to reveal an elderly man maybe in his 70s, he looked at me like I was his estranged son who had just got home from fighting in a foreign land. He smiled and asked “Can I help you son?” I meekly responded “No, I was just getting some water, sorry.” “No need to apologize, are you hungry at all?” he said, still smiling. I refused and thanked him for the water, I tried to leave but before I could he interjected “That is holy water you know? Actually the water itself is a miracle, this wall is over 1700 years old and in the 5th century Saint Ninian was walking this very road dehydrated and exhausted. He cried out ‘Lord I beg of you, give me water so I may quench my thirst’ and water flowed from this wall.” He smiled waiting for me to say something but I didn't really care for mythology. I asked him, “Do you know where Campbell croft is?” His smile wavered but only for a second ""You're not one of those ghost hunters are you?  You're playing with things you do not understand!” He wasn't angry but scared you could hear it in his voice. He looked like he was going to cry before clearing his throat and approaching me. He grips my hands with a firmness you would not expect from a man of his stature. “I beg you when you get to the end of this road avoid that croft, please.” He turned his back on me and entered the church. 



If I was a little creeped out before, I was terrified after leaving the church. I kept walking north on the road that I knew led to nowhere good. I have no reason to go to some haunted croft, I am not curious about the occult, ghosts or the bogeyman. It is a bunch of nonsense made up by people with nothing better to do. Evil is real but you aren't going to find it on the other end of a ouija board. Evil is committed daily by people like you and me, putting our needs beyond others. I have committed evil, what else would you call abandoning your own children? I still jump at every creaking branch and movement of squirrels in the brambles, I feel like I am being watched and although I know this is not true, the idea of setting up camp here makes me uneasy. As is accustomed in Scotland it begins to rain, I retrieve my waterproofs from my bag and put them on. I continue walking but over the following 45 minutes the summer downpour quickly turns into a full blown storm with rain bouncing off the tarmac and soaking me right through. I am now chittering as I just keep moving hopping I find some form of shelter maybe a bothy, we are in the highlands after all. Lightning tears through the air as my body quivers from the cold and the familiar scent of wet hay fills my nose. The terror hits me before I have fully formed the thought in my head. I push the thought away and continue to march miserably onwards before I see it a small stone cottage, maybe it's even a bothy. I approach and attempt to knock on the door but it opens as my knuckles make contact with the oak door. Inside there's a wood burning stove with an alcove filled with fire wood to the side of it. The floor is stone that was evidently painted maroon at one point but the paint has clearly begun to chip and flake away over the years.



I eagerly get a fire started and strip off my wet clothes and change into a clean set I've kept in a drybag. As the fire burns and my eyes adjust to the low light I get acquainted with my new surroundings. I see there is a bed or a wooden cot that is propped up on 4 granite blocks on each corner. It is around 6 feet long and 4 feet wide. I set up my hand pumped air mattress and laid my sleeping bag over the top. There is a book shelf by the bed with maybe 60 books on it. I am not much of a reader but I do need to take care not to use up my phone battery so I may need to pick up a book to pass the time. More importantly though there are pots above the stove. I can finally eat the noodles I have been lugging around with me. A warm bowl of food is exactly what I needed. I get settled on the leather seat in front of the fire and slurp down the chicken broth. My eyes start to get heavy as I hear what sounds like galloping from the road outside. Who on earth is horse riding in this weather? The sound fades as quickly as it came. I drag my exhausted body into my makeshift bed for the night and drift into sleep. My sword rests firmly on my side as we creep out of bed in the middle of the night. My host sleeps peacefully on the floor with her children, she gave us her bed to sleep in, they all did. My soul feels no shame and no remorse. We have our orders from Captain Robert Campbell of Glenlyon “no one under 70 should be left alive.” I killed that family and many more, I relished in the killing. I found myself laughing as I dragged children out of their homes slaughtering them like cattle.  I wake up sobbing in my sleeping bag, I feel sick. I miss the days where sleep mimicked death, an inky blackness that you are unaware of until you awoke hung over and groggy in the morning. It is 3am, I chose not to return to sleep but instead to start another fire. While tending to the fire I looked for a book to occupy my mine during the wee hours of the night. A lot of these books are completely uninteresting; flora of alba, fayborn codex, clans of Scotland,  kabalian, bushcraft and trapping. I pick up clans of Scotland and look up my surname, I find nothing of interest but I do find a chapter on the Campbells and I learn of the Glencoe massacre. They murdered women and children in their sleep under the orders of Major Robert Duncanson and Captain Campbell. I slam the book shut, how could I have dreamt of something I knew nothing about? I miss my family, as soon as this storm is over I am going home. I am going to get better and try to be a father to my children.

""AI's the future, man,"" he says, dumping his life savings into some hot new token called ""QuantumQuokka,"" because who wouldn't bet on a quokka's quantum leap? The coin's whitepaper? A 50-page ramble about marsupials mining blocks on the moon. Sounds legit. Dave's portfolio skyrockets overnight—up 300%—and he's already planning his yacht retirement, posting selfies with fake caviar. ""To the moon!"" he toasts on Twitter, high-fiving his cat. Then, Elon tweets about a dogecoin meme, the market sneezes, and QuantumQuokka dives faster than a lead balloon. Dave wakes up to -87%, his app glitching like it's possessed. He calls me in panic: ""Is this a rug pull or did the quokkas unionize?"" Turns out, the devs cashed out for actual quokkas—adorable, but bad for business. Dave's now back at his day job, trading coffee futures at Starbucks, muttering, ""Next time, I'm sticking to fiat... or at least something that doesn't hop away with my money."" 

Moral of the story? In crypto, the only thing going to the moon is your stress level—and maybe your therapist's bill. Trade safe, folks; the markets love a good punchline, but you're not always the comedian.",1,1759669666.0,BitBullito,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1nynpjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1nynpjl/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_ninja_cfp101_and/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker Ninja CFP101 and See If It Delivers,"Having spent the last few weeks brewing daily cups of coffee with the Ninja CFP100 Series coffee maker, I feel like I’ve gone on a caffeinated rollercoaster. From the rich aroma wafting through my kitchen to tinkering with every setting, my experience with this machine has been equally delightful and revealing. Whether you're an iced coffee aficionado or someone who enjoys a hot cup any time of the day, this coffee maker offers some nifty features worth discussing.

**Design and Build Quality**

At first glance, the black finish and compact dimensions (11.03""D x 9.9""W x 15.22""H) of the Ninja CFP100 Series coffee maker blend seamlessly into any kitchen. While it’s not bulky, it’s substantial enough to make a statement. The buttons on the interface are laid out well, giving it a modern aesthetic while being incredibly user-friendly. Plus, the foldable single-serve platform is a clever addition that prevents coffee splashes. This feature proved particularly helpful when I brewed a smaller cup during a busy morning rush and wanted to avoid the cleanup.

The 60-ounce removable water reservoir is a lifesaver for anyone, like me, who dreads the idea of awkwardly maneuvering a coffee maker under the faucet. It’s easy to carry, refill, and snap back into place. The weight of the machine is noticeable at 8.8 pounds, making it feel sturdy and well-constructed without being cumbersome to move.

**Performance**

This coffee maker doesn’t just brew—it performs. Unlike my old machine, which took its sweet time getting started in the morning, the Ninja comes to life almost instantly. Its faster brewing capability, compared to models like the Keurig K-Elite, caught my attention. Whether you're brewing a quick cup in the morning or brewing a full carafe for brunch guests, it handles both with efficiency.

I tested the machine’s three brewing styles: Classic, Rich, and Over Ice. Each offers distinct results tailored to individual preferences. The Classic setting produces a smooth and balanced flavor, Rich gives a deeper, java-forward experience, and Over Ice...well, simply brilliant! I brewed over ice on a particularly warm afternoon, and the resulting iced coffee had rich flavor notes without being watered down, which was seriously impressive.  

**Key Benefits**

- Versatile brewing styles: Classic, Rich, and Over Ice options adapt to various preferences.
- Convenient 9 grounds brew sizes and 4 traditional pod sizes.
- Keeps coffee warm with the adjustable warming plate for up to 4 hours.
- Dishwasher safe components simplify cleaning.

[Check Ninja CFP100 Series price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0cmvd6jb1/)

**Features I Loved**

The Thermal Flavor Extraction Duo deserves special mention. Whether you’re using coffee grounds or pods, this system ensures even saturation and precise temperature control for consistently great tasting coffee. I personally tested this with a more budget-friendly coffee pod, and, honestly, the flavors were extracted so well that my brother (a coffee snob himself!) couldn’t believe it wasn’t a high-end roast. The 12-cup glass carafe included is worth noting, as it’s an excellent size for families or office gatherings.

Another item included in the package is the Ninja Smart Scoop, which simplifies accurate coffee measurements. For someone like me, who typically eyeballs scoops and ends up brewing either rocket fuel or dishwater, this little accessory adds some much-needed precision.

**Areas of Concern**

Despite its impressive capabilities, the Ninja coffee maker isn’t without its pitfalls. The footprint is reasonable for most kitchens, but the height can be a challenge if your cabinets have limited space underneath. I had to reposition mine to an open countertop area, which wasn’t a dealbreaker but might be worth considering for smaller spaces.

Also, the warming plate, while effective, tends to build up residue over time. Cleaning it requires consistent maintenance to avoid coffee stains. Finally, the Ninja pod adapter, though handy, occasionally requires extra effort to clean thoroughly, which can be a small hassle after multiple uses.

- Taller build might not fit under lower cabinets.
- Warming plate requires frequent checking for cleanliness.
- Pod adapter needs careful cleaning after heavy use.

**Competitive Options**

Compared to rival options like the Keurig K-Elite and other hybrid systems on the market, the Ninja coffee maker stands out for its variety and ability to seamlessly switch between grounds and pods. The Keurig K-Elite delivers speedy pod-based coffee but lacks a carafe option and the tailored brewing styles offered here. On the other hand, Cuisinart’s kombi systems provide competitive performance, but I found their iced coffee approach lacking the balance that the Ninja provides so effortlessly. Simply put, the Ninja’s Thermal Flavor Extraction Duo is a game-changer for anyone who craves flavor precision.

**Value for Money**

With a plethora of features like multiple brewing styles, dual compatibility with grounds and pods, and thoughtful design, this coffee maker feels like a sound investment for coffee lovers. While definitely not the cheapest option in the coffee maker market, the value proposition lies in its versatility and performance. When considering the choice between separate pod-based machines and traditional drip systems, this all-in-one solution seems to justify its price tag.

At first, I really did enjoy selling policies. I happened to be good at it. And then of course the ugly happened these people don’t tell you how much it is to start up. I “invested” in myself & bought everything they wanted to me to buy, iPad,  Apple Pencil, leads, courses, apps that costs hundreds of dollars a month, etc etc. I would have weeks where I made 5-6k, because of the 9month advance you get from carriers. HOWEVER what they don’t tell you is the chargebacks. Every month I was paying nearly 4k a month just for the debt! $1500 a WEEK for leads that have been reused over and over, plus gas & maintenance on my car (you drive ALOT), coffee culture events that were out of town, I mean you NAME IT. Everything is out of pocket.  I damn near lost EVERYTHING. Actually, I did ended up having one of my cars repoed because I was paying roughly almost 10k a month with them plus my bills. It ruined me financially, also my credit. Even after leaving, any charge backs fall on me, which I can’t pay because I’m still rebuilding myself from the damage that caused me. Not only that nobody talks about the MENTAL damage. They encourage you to push push push, push through the pain.

They try to sell you the job by saying you get freedom because you can work whenever you want, trust me yall that is a LIE. You want to be good at it? You’re working from 9AM-11PM most days!

They remind me of those FOREX people with their conferences & motivational “talks”, It does take a toll on you mentally because your going to a stranger home they don’t KNOW you, you can easily be HARMED. I know agents who had literal guns pulled out on them. You have no idea who’s door your knocking on & what’s going on in there. I’ve seen the NASTIEST houses that can take a toll on your mental too.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nynlza,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1nynlza/first_date_help/,First Date Help,"Hello everyone! I'm a fairly younger (19) lesbian who's just finally getting back into dating after my last relationship ended rather badly. It's been around a year since I've last dated someone, and even longer since I've been on a first date. Last night, I worked up the courage to ask a girl out for the first time, and she agreed! We're meeting up for coffee at a cute, casual place I found online that's right in the middle of us-- she lives an hour away, she told me she would be willing to make the drive but I told her I'd feel guilty making her do that. So, my question(s) is: what do I wear? How should I do my makeup/hair? I'm very much at the femme end of the spectrum. I was thinking a V-Neck longsleeve and bootcute jeans with a headband and flats, along with curling my hair, but I'm not sure if that's too much. From what I can tell from her instagram, she's pretty laid-back and androgynous, but pretty much all of her pics are with friends or at club events so it's hard to gauge how she would dress for this :v additionally, what are good questions to ask?

1nynlxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nynlxi/aita_for_sleeping_with_my_wifes_sister_after_they/,"AITA for sleeping with my wife's sister after they spent months pushing us together, and now refusing to sign away my parental rights?","I slept with my wife's sister and destroyed everything, and honestly, I don't even know if I regret it or if I'm just angry they set me up to fail.

My wife and I were together for nine years. Two kids, a house in the suburbs, the whole deal. Then her sister got divorced last fall. Messy one. Her ex cleaned out their accounts and moved across the country. She was broke, depressed, and had nowhere to go.

My wife begged me to let her stay with us. Just for a few months, she said. Until she gets back on her feet. I wasn't thrilled but I'm not a monster. I said yes.

The first week was fine. She stayed in the guest room, kept to herself, cried a lot. I felt bad for her. But then things started shifting.

She'd come down for breakfast in these tiny shorts and tank tops. Nothing under them. My wife never said anything. Her sister would lean over the counter when I was making coffee and ask me questions about work. Real close. Her hand on my arm. Laughing at everything I said.

I tried to keep distance. I'm not stupid. But my mother-in-law started coming over more. And she'd make these comments. Like how her youngest daughter was still so beautiful. How any man would be lucky to have her. How my wife had really let herself go after the kids.

My wife was right there when she said that stuff. She'd just smile. Nervous. Like she didn't want to start a fight with her mom.

Her sister got bolder. She'd ask me to help her move furniture in her room. She'd call me when my wife wasn't home and ask me to pick her up from places. Once she came into the garage while I was working on my car. She bent down next to me, her chest practically in my face, and said I looked really good when I was all sweaty and focused.

I told my wife I was uncomfortable. I said her sister needed to find her own place. My wife got defensive. Said I was being paranoid. Said her sister was just being friendly and I was making it weird. Her mom called me that same night. Told me I was being cruel. That family helps family. That her daughter needed support, not judgment.

I felt like I was going crazy. But I backed off. Kept my head down. Tried to avoid being alone with her.

Then one night my wife took the kids to her parents' house for the weekend. Some family thing. I wasn't invited. My mother-in-law said it was just for the women and kids. I thought it was weird but whatever. I was happy to have the house quiet.

Her sister didn't go. She said she had a headache. My wife kissed me goodbye and left.

I was in the living room watching TV when she came downstairs. She was wearing this black dress. Makeup done. Hair curled. She sat next to me. Too close. Put her hand on my thigh.

I should have left the room. I know that. But I was so tired. Tired of being the bad guy. Tired of being told I was wrong. Tired of my wife dismissing me. Tired of her family treating me like I was lucky to be part of their lives.

She kissed me. I kissed her back. And then we went upstairs.

The next morning I woke up and the guilt hit me like a truck. I couldn't look at her. I told her it was a mistake. That it couldn't happen again. She smiled. Said it was okay. Said it would be our secret.

My wife came home that afternoon with the kids. She seemed happy. Relaxed even. Her sister was in the kitchen when we all walked in. She hugged my wife. Told her she missed her.

I couldn't eat dinner that night. I felt sick. But I thought maybe I could just bury it. Pretend it never happened. Move on.

Two weeks later my wife sat me down. She had her phone in her hand. She was crying. She showed me screenshots. Text messages between her sister and her mom. Talking about how the plan worked. How I finally took the bait. How they knew I would.

They set me up. The whole thing. My wife knew. Her mom knew. They wanted proof I was garbage so my wife could divorce me and take everything.

I tried to explain but what was I going to say? I did it. I actually slept with her sister. It doesn't matter that they manipulated me. It doesn't matter that they pushed her at me for months. I made the choice.

My wife filed for divorce the next day. Took the kids to her parents' house. Got a restraining order. Said I was unsafe. Her family told everyone in our social circle that I cheated. That I pursued her sister. That I was a predator.

No one believes me when I tell them the truth. They think I'm making excuses. Her family blocked me on everything. My in-laws won't let me see my kids without supervision. My wife's lawyer is destroying me in court.

I lost my job because her brother works at the same company and spread rumors. I'm living in a one-bedroom apartment. I see my kids twice a month at a facility with cameras.

Her sister moved to another state. Just disappeared. My wife got the house, primary custody, and half my retirement. Her family shows up to every hearing like they're supporting a victim.

I think about that night constantly. I hate myself for it. But I also hate them for knowing exactly what they were doing. For using me. For turning me into the villain they always wanted me to be.

Do I deserve this for being weak enough to fall for it?

1nynlur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1nynlur/see_the_god_before_he_rises/,See The God Before He Rises,"A Grave Elf entered the human town of Selton-on-Hill today. Mazimi of Oonwest arrived shortly after sunrise. She was dressed in forest green from head to toe save for the golden rings in her hair. 

Seltonans have a history of doing business with her kind. Grave Elves reject the gods, as do Seltonans, and the human money Grave Elves bring is as good as anyone else’s. Seltonans don’t know or care how these Elves come into possession of the money. As long as the Elf conducts business upon arrival and leaves Selton at its completion, the humans don’t care at all. 

But one Seltonan cared very much about Mazimi of Oonwest. That was Pietr, the Beermaker and Tavern Owner. He was the reason for her visit on this, her progression day, when she officially became a senior citizen. That would be clear to humans, from the color of her clothes to the number of rings in her hair. And, being a senior citizen, Seltonans were obligated to kill her.

Mazimi knew this, of course. No Grave Elf who did business with Seltonans could be ignorant of this fact. It was the single most important rule Seltonans had. It was a cornerstone of their culture for longer than any of them could remember. To live, Mazimi had until sundown to be out of town. She had to be far enough away that no arrow, dagger or catching net could reach her.


She pushed back the hood of her full-length cape and glided to the town’s tavern, where Pietr was sweeping the entryway of his tavern.


He acknowledged her with a smile while he brushed dust off his apron and set his broom against the tavern wall. He, his father, grandfather and many earlier generations, had history with Mazimi. She’d often purchased human beer for Grave Elf gatherings over the last few centuries. On rare occasions, humans were allowed to attend a Grave Elven event. The most polite of them described Elven beer as “too muscular”. Elven children used human beer as a lightweight “palate cleanser” between meal courses. 

Pietr wasn’t offended by that. A lifetime in the business had taught him to push his pride aside as long as he could fill the hole it left with money. He bowed and gave a traditional greeting. “Mazimi of Oonwest, honored friend and fellow god-killer, how can we help on this bright and beautiful morning?”

Mazimi remained calm but didn’t smile. “Pietr of Selton-on-Hill, fellow god-killer, today you may call me Mazimi. Will you be a Grave Elf killer today?”

Pietr shuddered and struggled to maintain his composure. No point pretending he didn’t know the townspeople would kill her today. Perhaps she wanted to rest, after a life that spanned several centuries. Or she could be attempting to lure him into revealing the plans to kill her, so she could avoid it. One could never be sure when dealing with any faction of Elves. “Mazimi, should we discuss this in the private room of my tavern?”

He was sure she’d been in the private room a few times. The wooden furniture in it was old but well-kept and the ice boxes at each end of the room were well stocked with Pietr’s best beer. Hauling fresh ice from the frozen spot at the top of the Hill was worth the twice weekly effort to satisfy his best paying customers.

She headed into the tavern without hesitation. Her speed always surprised Pietr. He was sure Elves pretended to walk like humans but didn’t make actual contact with the ground. She was in the private room, sipping water adorned with a basil leaf, by the time he locked the tavern door behind him.

He sat at her table, held his hands up with fingers spread and inhaled deeply. “I make beer, I own and run a tavern. That’s it. I’m your friend, not your killer.”

She tapped her glass on the table. He flinched when he felt a cool stein of beer in his hands. It was a sign that she wanted to speak without interruption. Elven magic unsettled him. The magic of Grave Elves always felt too personal for his liking. They knew exactly what to manifest to disrupt the thoughts of most humans. Resigned to his fate, he settled back in the chair and waved a hand to signal she could continue.


“Do you know why your people kill my people,” she look at Pietr long enough to raise his discomfort level again, “once we attain progression?”


He shook his head. 


She twirled the water in her glass. “Shall I show you?”  


He frowned. “If it’s safe.”


She set her glass down and showed him a walking stick he was sure he didn’t see earlier. It was dark gray mottled with gold and silver, as if made of stone. He caught a whiff of something like wet moss or freshly dug gardening soil. 


The walking stick burst into black flames. Mazimi raised it above her head and tapped it three times on the floor. She blew on the flames. They changed to gold. She paused.


He felt something rumble under his feet. He’d felt it one time before, when he was visiting family living much closer to the Western frontier. He’d reacted badly when the ground shook the first time. His uncle told him to relax, it was just a small earthquake. Things changed when the ground shook so hard Pietr almost fell over. His uncle told him to hide under a table and only when the dust settled did he tell Pietr it was safe to stand. Pietr never spoke to that side of the family again.


Mazimi tapped her flame-covered walking stick three times on the floor once more and the flames disappeared. She knelt, put her forehead on the floor and whispered something Pietr didn’t understand. She stood and the walking stick was gone.


Pietr began to sweat. “What did you say there?”


Mazimi considered her answer carefully. “It wasn’t a prayer, or an incantation. I prepared the earth elementals to meet you. All of them, that you call the trees of Rhoatrem.” 


He shook his head in disbelief and fear. “Trees are trees, they aren’t... they aren’t magic, they can’t walk or speak or... they aren’t elementals.”


She sat. “If they are not, what makes Rhoatrem different from all other forests? Why is it forbidden, if not because of gods and magic?”


He couldn’t answer. In his heart, he knew Rhoatrem was very different from any other forest he’d been around. Yet he couldn’t isolate why. Its leaves sounded like breath when reacting to the wind. Its branches moved without wind. The treetops glowed at night until you were close enough to step on its its territory. The worst was the way it beckoned to Pietr, almost pulling him into the forest when he left the town limits.


Mazimi broke through his worries. “Pietr of Selton-on-Hill, will you take a step and meet the god?”

He was somewhat familiar with Elven pranks, jokes and set-ups. This felt like the worst set-up ever. He didn’t want to participate or even acknowledge it, so he didn’t.

She walked to the door of the private room and signalled for him to follow. “Come see the god before he rises.”

Against his better judgment Pietr rose and unlocked the front door. He hoped this was a new kind of Elven prank or joke. Instinct told him otherwise.


The pair walked beyond town limits and approached Rhoatrem, the nearby and forbidden forest. Pietr stopped walking and again told Mazimi he couldn’t possibly enter the forest. Doing so meant certain death for Seltonans. 


Mazimi asked him two questions. How many times had he witnessed someone die after they’d entered Rhoatrem? How many dead bodies had he personally returned to the town for a proper burial? 


He stared at the ground, unable to answer. She knew not a single person had died in that way during his lifetime, despite rumors that several people had tested the prohibition.


“Let me help you,” she said, putting her hand around his wrist. “Let me give you the power.”


He nodded, resigned to whatever his fate was. He shut his eyes and inhaled deeply as they got to the first row of Rhoatrem trees. Four steps later he exhaled and opened his eyes. The forest of Rhoatrem seems like every other forest he’d been to. Tree branches didn’t swoop down to strangle him. Tree roots didn’t strain to trip him. No demons jumped from the treetops to block his journey. He glanced at Mazimi, who pointed to a small clearing five steps to their left. At the edge of the clearing, Mazimi tightened her grip on Pietr’s wrist until he thought it would break.


He wanted to complain, to ask her to stop. He opened his mouth and dropped to his knees, tears flowing. Smoke was coming from the bright red skin of his wrist, moving up his arm.


“It must be done,” Mazimi whispered. “It is how we share energy with humans. You will live. Look at the ground.”


The red skin and smoke reached Pietr’s shoulder. The smell of his own flesh burning left him gagging. He couldn’t help but stare at it. Mazimi tightened her grip further and Pietr landed face-first on the forest floor. 


“Look!” She nudged his knees with her boot. 


He looked towards her. 


“No,” she said, kicking the side of his chest, “look at the ground. Look at the god Rhoazus.” 


He blinked and looked down. Instead of his nose leaning on the ground, he was no more than a horse length from the back of a head large beyond belief. The hair, straight as any he’d ever seen, was a mix of brown and blond and gray. The neck below the head was also gray, the color of an heirloom dagger. The top of a shoulder was the same color as the neck. The shoulder was both smooth and muscular, as if carved to give the impression of great strength. Dust covered every part of this giant. He couldn’t smell the body, not like when he’d had to help with dead people. Instead, he smelled freshly-dug ground and the spices used in coffees during the snow season.


Pietr inhaled again. A cloud of dust rose from the giant shoulder as it twitched.


Mazimi placed Pietr’s hand on the ground as if he was a baby. The dirt was back, hiding the underground giant. Instead of spices and fresh dirt, the forest overwhelmed his senses. He sat and brushed his good hand against the burnt arm. It hurt, not as badly as he expected, and it didn’t smell like burnt meat. He risked a look at it. The skin remained bright red and somewhat swollen but he could now bend both wrist and elbow. He still favored that arm when he pushed down and managed to stand. His head was a little fuzzy.


“Now you know, Pietr who sees gods.”


That title stung. It would ensure his death if any Seltonan heard her. He made sure no one was around before answering. “We don’t believe in gods.”


“Gods don’t need your belief to exist,” she replied. “You now know this. You also know why your people kill my people when we achieve progression. We can wake the gods. And should your people become too arrogant, too full of yourselves...” 


She paused, motioned for him to start walking, and took the lead. “You, Pietr who sees gods, know we can and will waken the gods. You’ve seen. You know.”


His heart dropped. She had bestowed on him a terrible power, one that he could not reveal. And yet, if ever his people were to step out of line with the Graven Elves, he knew what would happen. Would he have the strength to speak the truth? Even if it meant his own death?


He picked up his pace until he was beside her, so he didn’t need to raise his voice to be heard. “This is a monstrous gift, one I don’t know that I deserved.” 


“Just as I don’t know I deserve to die tonight or any night.” Her tone wasn’t accusatory, yet it made clear her word was final.


Pietr put his arm out to stop her before they left the forest proper. “We have been friends all my life, Mazimi.” He bowed, arm to heart to honor the custom of Graven Elves.


“May it be a long and successful friendship,” she replied, bowing in kind. “You have the power, Pietr. You can wake the god if you believe the time is right. One of us will be here in two moons to order beer. I hope with my heart I will be that Elf.”


“As do I,” Pietr said as he stood. He watched as Mazimi turned towards Oonwest and faded from sight. He took his time walking back to his tavern.",1,1759669290.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

He bowed and gave a traditional greeting. “Mazimi of Oonwest, honored friend and fellow god-killer, how can we help on this bright and beautiful morning?”

Mazimi remained calm but didn’t smile. “Pietr of Selton-on-Hill, fellow god-killer, today you may call me Mazimi. Will you be a Grave Elf killer today?”

Pietr shuddered and struggled to maintain his composure. No point pretending he didn’t know the townspeople would kill her today. Perhaps she wanted to rest, after a life that spanned several centuries. Or she could be attempting to lure him into revealing the plans to kill her, so she could avoid it. One could never be sure when dealing with any faction of Elves. “Mazimi, should we discuss this in the private room of my tavern?”

He was sure she’d been in the private room a few times. The wooden furniture in it was old but well-kept and the ice boxes at each end of the room were well stocked with Pietr’s best beer. Hauling fresh ice from the frozen spot at the top of the Hill was worth the twice weekly effort to satisfy his best paying customers.

She headed into the tavern without hesitation. Her speed always surprised Pietr. He was sure Elves pretended to walk like humans but didn’t make actual contact with the ground. She was in the private room, sipping water adorned with a basil leaf, by the time he locked the tavern door behind him.

He sat at her table, held his hands up with fingers spread and inhaled deeply. “I make beer, I own and run a tavern. That’s it. I’m your friend, not your killer.”

She tapped her glass on the table. He flinched when he felt a cool stein of beer in his hands. It was a sign that she wanted to speak without interruption. Elven magic unsettled him. The magic of Grave Elves always felt too personal for his liking. They knew exactly what to manifest to disrupt the thoughts of most humans. Resigned to his fate, he settled back in the chair and waved a hand to signal she could continue.


“Do you know why your people kill my people,” she look at Pietr long enough to raise his discomfort level again, “once we attain progression?”


He shook his head. 


She twirled the water in her glass. “Shall I show you?”  


He frowned. “If it’s safe.”


She set her glass down and showed him a walking stick he was sure he didn’t see earlier. It was dark gray mottled with gold and silver, as if made of stone. He caught a whiff of something like wet moss or freshly dug gardening soil. 


The walking stick burst into black flames. Mazimi raised it above her head and tapped it three times on the floor. She blew on the flames. They changed to gold. She paused.


He felt something rumble under his feet. He’d felt it one time before, when he was visiting family living much closer to the Western frontier. He’d reacted badly when the ground shook the first time. His uncle told him to relax, it was just a small earthquake. Things changed when the ground shook so hard Pietr almost fell over. His uncle told him to hide under a table and only when the dust settled did he tell Pietr it was safe to stand. Pietr never spoke to that side of the family again.


Mazimi tapped her flame-covered walking stick three times on the floor once more and the flames disappeared. She knelt, put her forehead on the floor and whispered something Pietr didn’t understand. She stood and the walking stick was gone.


Pietr began to sweat. “What did you say there?”


Mazimi considered her answer carefully. “It wasn’t a prayer, or an incantation. I prepared the earth elementals to meet you. All of them, that you call the trees of Rhoatrem.” 


He shook his head in disbelief and fear. “Trees are trees, they aren’t... they aren’t magic, they can’t walk or speak or... they aren’t elementals.”


She sat. “If they are not, what makes Rhoatrem different from all other forests? Why is it forbidden, if not because of gods and magic?”


He couldn’t answer. In his heart, he knew Rhoatrem was very different from any other forest he’d been around. Yet he couldn’t isolate why. Its leaves sounded like breath when reacting to the wind. Its branches moved without wind. The treetops glowed at night until you were close enough to step on its its territory. The worst was the way it beckoned to Pietr, almost pulling him into the forest when he left the town limits.


Mazimi broke through his worries. “Pietr of Selton-on-Hill, will you take a step and meet the god?”

He was somewhat familiar with Elven pranks, jokes and set-ups. This felt like the worst set-up ever. He didn’t want to participate or even acknowledge it, so he didn’t.

She walked to the door of the private room and signalled for him to follow. “Come see the god before he rises.”

Against his better judgment Pietr rose and unlocked the front door. He hoped this was a new kind of Elven prank or joke. Instinct told him otherwise.


The pair walked beyond town limits and approached Rhoatrem, the nearby and forbidden forest. Pietr stopped walking and again told Mazimi he couldn’t possibly enter the forest. Doing so meant certain death for Seltonans. 


Mazimi asked him two questions. How many times had he witnessed someone die after they’d entered Rhoatrem? How many dead bodies had he personally returned to the town for a proper burial? 


He stared at the ground, unable to answer. She knew not a single person had died in that way during his lifetime, despite rumors that several people had tested the prohibition.


“Let me help you,” she said, putting her hand around his wrist. “Let me give you the power.”


He nodded, resigned to whatever his fate was. He shut his eyes and inhaled deeply as they got to the first row of Rhoatrem trees. Four steps later he exhaled and opened his eyes. The forest of Rhoatrem seems like every other forest he’d been to. Tree branches didn’t swoop down to strangle him. Tree roots didn’t strain to trip him. No demons jumped from the treetops to block his journey. He glanced at Mazimi, who pointed to a small clearing five steps to their left. At the edge of the clearing, Mazimi tightened her grip on Pietr’s wrist until he thought it would break.


He wanted to complain, to ask her to stop. He opened his mouth and dropped to his knees, tears flowing. Smoke was coming from the bright red skin of his wrist, moving up his arm.


“It must be done,” Mazimi whispered. “It is how we share energy with humans. You will live. Look at the ground.”


The red skin and smoke reached Pietr’s shoulder. The smell of his own flesh burning left him gagging. He couldn’t help but stare at it. Mazimi tightened her grip further and Pietr landed face-first on the forest floor. 


“Look!” She nudged his knees with her boot. 


He looked towards her. 


“No,” she said, kicking the side of his chest, “look at the ground. Look at the god Rhoazus.” 


He blinked and looked down. Instead of his nose leaning on the ground, he was no more than a horse length from the back of a head large beyond belief. The hair, straight as any he’d ever seen, was a mix of brown and blond and gray. The neck below the head was also gray, the color of an heirloom dagger. The top of a shoulder was the same color as the neck. The shoulder was both smooth and muscular, as if carved to give the impression of great strength. Dust covered every part of this giant. He couldn’t smell the body, not like when he’d had to help with dead people. Instead, he smelled freshly-dug ground and the spices used in coffees during the snow season.


Pietr inhaled again. A cloud of dust rose from the giant shoulder as it twitched.


Mazimi placed Pietr’s hand on the ground as if he was a baby. The dirt was back, hiding the underground giant. Instead of spices and fresh dirt, the forest overwhelmed his senses. He sat and brushed his good hand against the burnt arm. It hurt, not as badly as he expected, and it didn’t smell like burnt meat. He risked a look at it. The skin remained bright red and somewhat swollen but he could now bend both wrist and elbow. He still favored that arm when he pushed down and managed to stand. His head was a little fuzzy.


“Now you know, Pietr who sees gods.”


That title stung. It would ensure his death if any Seltonan heard her. He made sure no one was around before answering. “We don’t believe in gods.”


“Gods don’t need your belief to exist,” she replied. “You now know this. You also know why your people kill my people when we achieve progression. We can wake the gods. And should your people become too arrogant, too full of yourselves...” 


She paused, motioned for him to start walking, and took the lead. “You, Pietr who sees gods, know we can and will waken the gods. You’ve seen. You know.”


His heart dropped. She had bestowed on him a terrible power, one that he could not reveal. And yet, if ever his people were to step out of line with the Graven Elves, he knew what would happen. Would he have the strength to speak the truth? Even if it meant his own death?


He picked up his pace until he was beside her, so he didn’t need to raise his voice to be heard. “This is a monstrous gift, one I don’t know that I deserved.” 


“Just as I don’t know I deserve to die tonight or any night.” Her tone wasn’t accusatory, yet it made clear her word was final.


Pietr put his arm out to stop her before they left the forest proper. “We have been friends all my life, Mazimi.” He bowed, arm to heart to honor the custom of Graven Elves.


“May it be a long and successful friendship,” she replied, bowing in kind. “You have the power, Pietr. You can wake the god if you believe the time is right. One of us will be here in two moons to order beer. I hope with my heart I will be that Elf.”


“As do I,” Pietr said as he stood. He watched as Mazimi turned towards Oonwest and faded from sight. He took his time walking back to his tavern.",1,1759669290.0,LGwrites,0,1.0,False

A handful of months ago Blizzard released an expansion for Diablo 4, and I’ve been sitting here staring at that “Add to Cart” button like it’s a boss fight I’m not high enough level for since then. The expansion is on sale for $15.99, which makes it even more painful to resist — but sadly, my gold stash (aka bank account) is very limited (AKA I’m broke).

I just finished a big move recently (hooray for finally having walls again!), but between boxes, rent, security deposit, moving Truck, movers for heavy furniture, and the joys of “adulting,” I haven’t been able to afford much beyond coffee and instant noodles. My poor druid is waisting away in character select, waiting for me to return to slap demons with shred.

Lately I’ve been really enjoying poison shred Werewolf Druid, which is basically teleport to enemies and smack them to death with claws and poison. There’s just something so satisfying about charging into a horde, turning into a blur of fur and venom, and watching demons melt faster than my bank account after this move. But hey, cheaper rent definitely will make this all work out eventually!

If some kind soul out there would be willing to help me grab Vessel of Hatred, I’d be eternally grateful. I love the look of the new class and am so beyond excited to roll a spiritborn character. I love cats, and while there’s more to spiritborn than just “Jaguar spirit guy”, they honestly had me at “Jaguar spirit guy” anyways. The new cat mounts are also a huge draw for me, I’ll probably rarely use horse mounts again I feel.

Also, that new jungle region looks absolutely stunning from what I’ve seen in the previews — lush green foliage, ancient temples, shadowy beasts — and I’m just itching to prowl through it, shredding demons and pretending I’m a jaguar god of doom. Plus, they’ve raised the level cap and added new endgame systems that actually make me want to farm again (and not just cry into my stash tabs). Plus, Mephisto needs a good smacking. I’m not sure if I actually get to defeat him in this expansion but hands down favorite looking boss from D2. If I can farm him, I will.

Either way, thanks for reading and may your loot always be legendary! 🐐🔥

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

For anyone new, here's what I do: I take Vegas lines/odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings, FanDuel and OwnersBox salaries to calculate a value score. This helps highlight who's overpriced and who’s underpriced.

These plays tend to be chalky/high ownership, so I typically use them for double-ups, but you’re free to use the info however you want.


⚠️ Disclaimer

- No such thing as a lock — use at your own risk.

- Not betting advice — just my process and what works for me.

- I post for free. Use it, fade it, roast it — up to you.


🔑 Core Plays

I run an optimizer for every slate to identify the strongest builds. Since sharing full lineups is against T&C (and would just have everyone running the same thing anyway), here are a few core plays the optimizer is high on:

- QB: TBD

- RB: TBD

- WR: TBD

- TE: TBD

- DST: TBD

At first, I really did enjoy selling policies. I happened to be good at it. And then of course the ugly happened these people don’t tell you how much it is to start up. I “invested” in myself & bought everything they wanted to me to buy, iPad,  Apple Pencil, leads, courses, apps that costs hundreds of dollars a month, etc etc. I would have weeks where I made 5-6k, because of the 9month advance you get from carriers. HOWEVER what they don’t tell you is the chargebacks. Every month I was paying nearly 4k a month just for the debt! $1500 a WEEK for leads that have been reused over and over, plus gas & maintenance on my car (you drive ALOT), coffee culture events that were out of town, I mean you NAME IT. Everything is out of pocket.  I damn near lost EVERYTHING. Actually, I did ended up having one of my cars repoed because I was paying roughly almost 10k a month with them plus my bills. It ruined me financially, also my credit. Even after leaving, any charge backs fall on me, which I can’t pay because I’m still rebuilding myself from the damage that caused me. Not only that nobody talks about the MENTAL damage. They encourage you to push push push, push through the pain. Wave a gold carrot in your face, showing the trips the partners in the company take every day while they yell at you on the phone every morning telling your that your not doing enough, it’s not that they care it’s because YOUR the reason they can live lavishly. They brag about making $2.5 million a year. They make that because you sacrifice your time, your freedom. They try to sell you the job by saying you get freedom because you can work whenever you want, trust me yall that is a LIE. You want to be good at it? You’re working from 9AM-11PM most days! If your out for a couple days they make you feel bad about it because “your not doing enough, we don’t work part time” blah blah blah THE LIST GOES ON. They try to motivate you by giving you these weak ass motivational quotes that make no sense what so ever, they are ALWAYS in left field. They remind me of those FOREX people with their conferences & motivational “talks”, It does take a toll on you mentally because your going to a stranger home they don’t KNOW you, you can easily be HARMED. I know agents who had literal guns pulled out on them. You have no idea who’s door your knocking on & what’s going on in there. I’ve seen the NASTIEST houses that can take a toll on your mental too.

I have no knowledge about notes. All I can tell you is, I love gourmand fragrances and I had a low budget.

Following is my attempt at describing the notes (I am extremely sorry if this makes anyone furious; again, I have no clue about notes. I’m just trying to explain how they smell to me :p):

Choco Musk: Smells like a creamy mix of vanilla, milk chocolate, and soft musk. It’s sweet, cozy, and for some reason, I also smelled a little sandalwood. I might be completely wrong about the last one. Rating: 4/5

Dalal: A caramel and vanilla combination with a slight fruity twist. I couldn’t connect it to citrus, but it definitely has a fruity hint. It’s like a fruit dessert. Rating: 5/5 (I guess it’s my favourite out of the three.)

French Coffee: Exactly what one imagines after reading the name. Coffee with the sweetness of cream. This reminded me of the Kopiko coffee candy! Rating: 4/5

Overall: I loved all three of them! I wanted gourmand scents, and none of them disappointed me. Each one is on the sweeter side and makes me crave some baked cake or dessert.

Source: Daarul Kitab (Website)

Took the help of ChatGPT to refine the whole thing.

Jacqueline has been on oxygen for far longer then she has admitted to being on it, as members of this sub had picked up on the hissing sound of the oxygen machine during some of her videos. Here’s a bit of a shallow dive into Jacqueline and her oxygen usage.

Top left: March 2024, her post for her parents wedding anniversary. In this post not only could you hear the oxygen machine, but her face has the classic telltale pressure signs of the tubes on her cheeks and the irritation under her nose. Even though she applied a filter prior to doing her make up, the redness is still visible.

Top right: February 2025, the first time she admitted to using supplemental oxygen. She looks almost delirious with delight! You can almost see the thought bubble above her head “Kevin, I’d love to get up and make my own sugar laden, slightly coffee flavoured, calorific milkshake but I’m just an oxygen deprived widdle baby and I can’t move because of my oxygen machine….”

Bottom left: July 2025, Jacqueline has 3 doctors appointments in one day and posts a video where she’s singing a song by a known domestic abuser whilst bragging that she no longer needs to use supplemental oxygen due to her wearing her CPAP and working hard on her ‘breathing exercises’.

Bottom right: October 2025, Jacqueline posts her September “moments I was thriving not just surviving’ post. I don’t know what part of having to be on supplemental oxygen whilst just *checks notes* **sitting in a car** is thriving, but I want no part in it. I’m 2-3 years older than her, and I would likely die of embarrassment if I had to wear supplemental oxygen due to being 500lbs. Even my 7 year old (who definitely does not have medical degrees) would be able to tell you losing just 100lbs would enable her to breathe better. Once again she looks almost delirious, although that could just be the result of oxygen therapy! 

Side note: I’m adding this link here, for **anyone** *raises an eyebrow at our friend who we all know visits here* who is thinking, “losing weight wouldn’t help with breathing, surely”.

It’s scientifically proven that - if you are obese - losing just 5-10% of your body weight has huge health benefits, in Jacqueline’s case that’s just 25-50lbs and I would always tell my weight loss clients that as it helps to break down that 50lbs - 100lbs target into small manageable amounts.

I have no knowledge about notes. All I can tell you is, I love gourmand fragrances and I had a low budget.

Following is my attempt at describing the notes (I am extremely sorry if this makes anyone furious; again, I have no clue about notes. I’m just trying to explain how they smell to me :p):

Choco Musk: Smells like a creamy mix of vanilla, milk chocolate, and soft musk. It’s sweet, cozy, and for some reason, I also smelled a little sandalwood. I might be completely wrong about the last one.
Rating: 4/5

Dalal: A caramel and vanilla combination with a slight fruity twist. I couldn’t connect it to citrus, but it definitely has a fruity hint. It’s like a fruit dessert.
Rating: 5/5 (I guess it’s my favourite out of the three.)

French Coffee: Exactly what one imagines after reading the name. Coffee with the sweetness of cream. This reminded me of the Kopiko coffee candy!
Rating: 4/5

Overall: I loved all three of them! I wanted gourmand scents, and none of them disappointed me. Each one is on the sweeter side and makes me crave some baked cake or dessert.

Took the help of ChatGPT to refine the whole thing.

TL;DR:
Gourmand attars that smell delicious and cozy!
Choco Musk: sweet, chocolatey vanilla hug
Dalal: fruity caramel dessert (my favorite)
French Coffee: creamy coffee candy 
All three smell edible and comforting.",16,1759668197.0,desifemfrag,6,0.95,False

more or less just need some advice. I have ibs-d, and it’s been ruining my life for years now. I’m only 22 and I feel like I don’t get to enjoy life at all.

I’ve been low fodmap since June, (measuring, weighing, following it exactly). When I stated introduction everything was working pretty good! The first week of September I went out with my partner after avoiding restaurants for over a year. I didn’t go too crazy, definitely ate FODMAPS but wasn’t too worried about it. Went right back to low fodmap right after. Since then it’s like nothing works. low fodmap doesn’t help at all, I feel like if anything it’s getting worse. 

My doctor put me on Olestry 2x daily, about two days ago. Again, I feel like it’s just made it worse, urgency is 10x more and it’s extremely painful. 

I’m so tired. I scroll this subreddit and see talk of diapers and incontinence and I’m terrified. I feel like I can never leave my house, I have zero savings because how am I supposed to work when I can’t control my bowels? I’m scared to eat, my vitamin deficiency is getting insane. And I know all of this is just making it extremely worse. But this cannot be my entire life. 

I’ve quit my dream job because of this. It’s ruining my relationship because I don’t like going out, we can’t eat together, and honestly I don’t enjoy sex because I’m too worried that something will happen. I have no friends either because I don’t feel comfortable going out for long periods of time, I can’t eat out or grab coffee. If this is my life it is a fucking sad one. I’ve missed funerals, baby showers, birthdays, and so so so much. 

I used to take immodium basically everyday until I grew tolerant to it. I need a medication that actually works. From November-June last year I tried high fibre and that also made it worse. And please I don’t want any antidepressants/anti anxiety’s. I’m only depressed/anxious because my life is nonexistent due to the concern of shitting myself. 

The fact no one knows what causes IBS and half of the solutions I see are for IBS-C, and it seems like most of the “solutions” are just bandaids pisses me off so much it’s insane. 

Has anyone had any luck with loperamide prescribed daily? or any other medication? I’m in Canada for reference. Please, I need my life back. ",1,1759667880.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

I've been on quite a journey lately, testing out different mug warmers because I was tired of my coffee getting cold while I'm working. After trying several brands and spending way too much money (so you don't have to), I thought I'd share my findings.

First off, let me tell you - not all mug warmers are created equal. I learned this the hard way after buying a cheap one that barely kept my drink lukewarm. The main differences I've noticed are in temperature control, heating technology, and build quality.

The biggest game-changer for me was discovering gravity-sensing technology in some higher-end mug warmers. These smart devices automatically turn on when you place your mug down and off when you lift it. Pretty neat, right? I found an awesome one here that's been my daily companion: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer

Now, let's talk about temperature settings. Basic models usually have just one temperature setting, which can be frustrating if you're like me and prefer different temperatures for coffee versus tea. The better ones offer adjustable temperature controls, typically ranging from 104°F to 140°F.

Material quality is another huge factor. The cheaper ones often have plastic bases that can warp over time, while premium models use aluminum or ceramic heating plates. I've found that metal plates distribute heat more evenly and last longer.

Battery life is worth considering if you're planning to use it away from an outlet. Most plug-in models are more reliable, but there are some decent cordless options out there. Just expect to pay more for that convenience.

Speaking of convenience, waterproof features are a lifesaver. Trust me, spills happen! Some brands offer water-resistant designs that protect the electronics better than others. The one I use (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) has saved me from several coffee disasters.

Safety features vary too. Look for auto-shutoff functions - they're essential if you're forgetful like me. Some brands offer 4-hour automatic shutoff, while others go up to 8 hours.

Display types range from simple LED indicators to fancy LCD screens showing exact temperatures. While nice to have, I've found that simpler displays are often more reliable long-term.

After months of testing, I've realized that spending a bit more on a quality mug warmer is worth it. The cheaper ones might save you money initially, but they often need replacing within months. Plus, they just don't perform as well.

Bottom line: pay attention to temperature control options, build quality, and safety features when choosing your mug warmer. Don't make the same mistakes I did by going for the cheapest option first. Your perfect cup of coffee deserves better!

Let me know if you have any questions about specific brands or features - I've probably tried them all at this point!",1,1759667285.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

So I packed my journaling bag and went to the nearest park. I had to change places because of the noise coming from the playground but the second spot was much better (see 3rd and 4th picture)

I started journaling purely out of need. I was going through some mental issues back during high school and I noticed later on that journaling has a therapeutic effect on my mental health.

I am temporarily disabled, and I have a red hang tag from my State MVA as a result. I don't use it every time, but having a disability has made me more sensitive to the challenges that handicapped people face.

I found a car with no HC plate nor hang tag in a handicap space at the coffee shop near my doctor's, and I was not amused.
I parked behind the car, blocking it in.
A while later, I noticed a man lingering by the door and scanning the store. I asked him if that was his car, and he asked if I would let him out. I tore him a new a**hole in front of thirty customers and staff for taking a HC space when he had no right to. I hope I left an impression.

I’ve been consistently drinking caffeine longer than that but 5 years ago marks when I got sober from alcohol so naturally caffeine became a pretty big crutch for me and my consumption escalated quickly. I probably drank about 6+ cups a day. 

I have quit cold turkey. I am not the type who can do tapering so I have just dove in head first. Day 1 and 2 were brutal. My head was in so much pain and I felt pretty emotional. Day 3 pain has subsided I’m still tired but grateful that the massive headache has gone away. 

I would love to hear about the benefits yall have had from quitting entirely. It still feels a bit scary to me to never go back. I’m on a spiritual journey and that’s one of the biggest reasons for quitting. It was getting in the way of my meditations. I also felt like my cortisol levels were through the roof. I really didn’t like feeling like I needed it to function and be okay during the day. I always had the little voice in my head telling me I needed more. Even when I felt nauseous from drinking so much caffeine. 

So yes any and all positive experiences quitting caffeine would be so greatly appreciated. I’m grateful that I found this sub 🙏🏻🩷",1,1759667094.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1nyms10,https://i.redd.it/oh5pfru6datf1.png,"From Home to Research Halls, and From Your Living Room to Leading a Remarkable Career","You Might Be in Your Room Now—But You’re Already Closer Than You Think

Here, from your own living room, your global academic journey can begin—especially if you’re exploring online PhD programs for working professionals designed to fit real life.

Maybe you’re sitting in your room right now, browsing on your phone or laptop, surrounded by familiar details: a cup of coffee, family sounds in the background, maybe a child playing nearby. It may not seem like a scene from a prestigious university or a cutting-edge research lab—but it absolutely can be.

**At** [**Vertex University**](https://vertexuniversity.edu.eu/), you don’t need long hallways, crowded classrooms, or exhausting schedules to live an authentic academic experience.  
All you need is the belief that your dream can start right where you are.

# Don’t Pause Life—Online PhD Programs for Working Professionals

One of the greatest challenges for those seeking academic advancement is balancing life and study. In traditional education models, the price of a degree can be steep: missed family moments, mental stress, high costs of travel and living, and burnout from juggling work and education.

But at [Vertex](https://vertexuniversity.edu.eu/)

, you can attend a lecture from your living room, speak with your supervisor from your work desk, and join a research seminar right after dinner with your family.  
You can be a parent, a professional, or an entrepreneur—and still, a true student experiencing global academic engagement through our online PhD programs for working professionals.

# Life Doesn’t Wait—And Now, Education Doesn’t Have To

In a world moving at lightning speed, waiting for the “right time” to pursue education is no longer realistic.  
The truth is: the right time is now. Online learning is no longer just an alternative—it’s the ideal path for both personal and professional development, especially at the postgraduate level.

At [Vertex University](https://vertexuniversity.edu.eu/), you don’t need to leave home, say goodbye to your family, or put your career on hold to earn a PhD.  
What you do need is genuine passion, a laptop, and a stable internet connection.  
The outcome? A prestigious, internationally recognized degree that opens the doors to both academic and professional worlds—perfectly suited for online PhD programs for working professionals.

# Online Education—As It Should Be

At [Vertex University](https://vertexuniversity.edu.eu/)

, online education is not limited to recorded videos or automated assignments.  
It’s a fully integrated model, designed to replicate—and even exceed—the traditional academic experience.

With live interactive lectures, virtual workshops, and open discussions with world-class faculty and global experts, you won’t feel like you’re learning from a distance.  
You’ll feel like you’re at the heart of academic life, immersed in research, and surrounded by everything you need to lead your future.

This is education that doesn’t separate you from life—it brings you deeper into it through knowledge, giving you real tools for transformation, all while staying right where you are.

# [Vertex University](https://vertexuniversity.edu.eu/): Real Flexibility, Not Just Promises

Every day, thousands of working professionals, parents, and busy students wish for a way to pursue higher education without sacrificing their responsibilities.

Vertex University doesn’t just *promise* flexibility—it was built on it.  
Here, you study at the time that suits you, from the place that supports you, and in the way that empowers you.

No traffic, no surprise classes, no choosing between your family and your future.  
Just a learning system that respects your time, understands your life, and treats you as a partner—not just a student ID number.

# Programs That Shape You into a Leader—Not Just a Learner

Why do you study?  
To hang a certificate on the wall? To enter the job market with another generic degree?  
Or is it because you want something deeper—to be someone who makes a difference?

Vertex University programs don’t just offer knowledge—they foster transformation.  
Each college is built around disciplines that align with digital change, real market needs, and the challenges of tomorrow:

* In the[ **College of Business**](https://vertexuniversity.edu.eu/en/colleges/college-of-business-administration/), you’re prepared to lead in finance and entrepreneurship—not just work in them.
* In the [**College of E-Learning**](https://vertexuniversity.edu.eu/en/colleges/college-of-e-learning/), you’ll learn to design and lead educational ecosystems that shape millions of minds.
* In the [**College of Engineering and IT**](https://vertexuniversity.edu.eu/en/colleges/college-of-engineering-and-information-technology/), you’ll harness technology to transform the world—not just perform tasks.
* In the [**College of Health and Environmental Sciences**](https://vertexuniversity.edu.eu/en/colleges/college-of-health-and-environmental-sciences/), you’ll help solve the most pressing issues in health and sustainability.

Every academic path here is an invitation to lead—and every major is a doorway to building your future, from where you are now.

# Your Professional Dreams Begin… Right From Your Living Room

Between the moment you register and the moment you graduate with an internationally accredited degree, you’ll realize something profound:  
You weren’t just studying.  
You were growing, evolving, and building your future—one milestone at a time.  
All while staying in your own space.

From your small home office… you joined global conversations.  
From your humble desk… You built a graduation project reviewed by international academics.  
From your living room… You are prepared to lead a team, a company—or even a country.

# Vertex: A University That Understands You—Because Its Vision Starts with You

At Vertex University, we don’t offer digital education just because it’s a trend.  
We do it because we believe education should be accessible, realistic, and flexible enough to fit your life as it is—not as it “should” be.

That’s why we designed an academic model that reflects your reality, supports your journey, and gives you a learning experience that goes beyond walls—one that prepares you to lead in a world that no longer waits.

1nymper,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wonsulting/comments/1nymper/why_hiring_sucks_right_now_and_how_to_actually/,Why hiring sucks right now (and how to actually win at it),"Let’s be real: hiring sucks right now… seriously.

You apply to 100+ jobs, get ghosted, then see “we went with another candidate” even though you were qualified. 

And additionally..
- Companies post jobs they aren’t even hiring for yet.
- Hiring managers can’t interview until headcount is unlocked ￼.
- Recruiters get flooded with hundreds of applications, so your resume gets skimmed for 6 seconds max ￼.
- Most applicants only use the worst tier: applying online. That’s Tier 4: the lowest success rate ￼

So how do you flip the odds?

1. Stop relying on “Apply”: Move up the tiers: connect with team members (Tier 2) or hiring managers (Tier 1) on LinkedIn. A hiring manager referral almost guarantees an interview..

2) Reach out for coffee chats: mesage people who share your background, school, or role. Keep it human, not spammy. Example: “I’d love to learn how you got into [company].” ￼

3) Leverage your interviews: Once you land one, tell other recruiters. It makes you look in-demand and can unlock faster interview cycles ..

Apply smarter > harder FTW

1nymp9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetPhilosophy/comments/1nymp9z/integrity_in_the_fire_how_i_refused_to_lose_myself/,Integrity in the Fire: How I Refused to Lose Myself,"People talk about resilience like it’s a buzzword. But resilience isn’t just a feel-good slogan — it’s the choices you make when you’re standing in the fire, when everything in your life is stacked against you, when every easy exit tempts you to abandon yourself.

I know this because I’ve lived it.

Not long ago, my life became a nightmare. Without my knowledge, my coffee was being dosed daily with methamphetamine. By the time I realized what had been happening, I was hooked. Most people can’t imagine what it feels like to wake up and realize your body is dependent on a substance you didn’t consciously choose. You don’t just “quit” something like that overnight — especially when it’s been administered secretly for weeks on end.

And yet, even in the haze of that experience, something inside me stayed awake. Call it the soul, call it spirit, call it God sitting at the kitchen table — it doesn’t matter what name you give it. There was a presence, a quiet, steady knowing that never left me. That presence reminded me of who I really am.

That’s how, instead of letting meth destroy me, I turned it into a strange kind of schooling. While others around me were slipping further into chaos, I was online at three in the morning, taking free Harvard courses, digging through declassified CIA and FBI documents about mind manipulation, teaching myself how the brain works, how the dark web works, how systems of control work. I wasn’t escaping — I was preparing. I was retraining my own mind from the inside out, even while my nervous system was hijacked.

It wasn’t clean. It wasn’t pretty. And yes, there were close calls.

One of those close calls happened the night I got pulled over. In my car: twelve grams of methamphetamine — just shy of an ounce. By every legal standard, that’s a lot of dope. Enough for a serious charge. Enough to be labeled a trafficker. Enough to bury my life for years.

I wasn’t trafficking. I wasn’t selling. It was my monthly supply. But the person riding with me had a pipe under their seat, and when the police divided up the evidence, suddenly half the dope was “his” and half was “mine,” and we were both facing charges.

Here’s where integrity costs something.

I could have taken the easy out. I could have let that person carry the weight. I could have said nothing and let the system do what it does. Instead, when we went to court, I told the judge the truth. All of it.

I told him the drugs were mine.
I told him the other person was just a passenger.
I told him how I ended up there.
I told him about being drugged.
I told him about the strange parasite in my eye.
I told him about the manipulation, the betrayal, the breakdown.

I didn’t water it down to make it sound normal. I didn’t hide the “weird” parts to make myself more palatable. I told the truth as I knew it, raw and unfiltered, because that’s what integrity is: owning what is yours, refusing what isn’t, and standing in your story even if it makes people uncomfortable.

Something happened in that courtroom. You could feel it. The atmosphere shifted. The judge sobered. The court clerk cried. And instead of a felony trafficking charge, I walked away with a simple possession charge and a $600 fine.

I don’t believe that was an accident. I believe that was the divine standing with me.

I’ve never cared how crazy people think I sound when I say this: God sits with us. God sits with me. Every time something like this happens, that presence is there. And once you’ve experienced that, you don’t need another human being’s permission or confirmation to know what’s true.

That’s why, even in the middle of chaos, I kept my moral compass. That’s why I never shifted blame, even when it would have been convenient. That’s why I kept studying, kept learning, kept rebuilding my mind. Because my integrity was the one thing I refused to lose.

As I write this now, a skunk crosses the road in front of me — black and white, a living symbol of contrast, boundaries, and respect. Skunks don’t ask for validation. They don’t need permission to exist. They just walk their path, unapologetic, carrying their power quietly until they’re forced to release it. Seeing it feels like confirmation of the very lesson I’m sharing:

You can be in the messiest situation of your life. You can be manipulated, drugged, criminalized, misunderstood. But as long as you don’t abandon your truth, as long as you keep your integrity, as long as you walk your path with respect and clarity, you are free — even before the system says you are.

That’s what’s spectacular.
That’s what’s phenomenal.
That’s what’s magnificent about being alive.

It isn’t just surviving the fire.
It’s refusing to lose yourself inside it.

⸻

Philosopher’s Note

Life will always challenge you. It will throw impossible choices, chaotic circumstances, and manipulations in your path. But your inner life — your integrity, your awareness, your commitment to truth — cannot be taken.

Freedom is not simply the absence of external control. Freedom is the mastery of your own energy, the courage to honor your moral compass, and the audacity to continue learning, growing, and loving, even when the world seems determined to pull you down.

When you embrace this, when you walk your path consciously and without compromise, every obstacle becomes a teacher, every threat becomes an opportunity, and every moment — no matter how dark — becomes a mirror of your divine potential.

In short: the fire is real, but you are more real.

Author’s Note:
I want to be clear for anyone reading this and wondering — I am completely clean of all substances now, and have been for over four years. That experience did not stop me or define me; it sharpened me. It taught me about integrity, resilience, and the power of self-reclamation. Everything I’ve written here comes from a place of sobriety, reflection, and hard-won freedom.

Am I misreading his signals?,"Three weeks ago I (25M) hit up Dan (25M, pseudonym), who I saw on and off in Feb-May 2024, after around a year and a half of pretty minimal contact. He has a boyfriend now but I am getting weird vibes from him hinting he is still attracted to me. Can’t tell if it’s in my head or real.

Context: We saw each other about a dozen times during our situationship, but we spent quite a bit of time together working out, reading the news in bed/at cafes, chilling at cafes and doing work, etc and he went up to Baltimore once to see me.

I asked if he wanted to cuddle, but he said he couldn’t bc he had a bf and they were “still figuring it out.” He insisted on drinks/coffee, which we did about three weeks ago on a Thursday. He threw out plans to hang that weekend — going to a climbing gym near me (he had 2 guest passes), estate sale (I mentioned I was looking for home decor), working out.

We spent the entire day together (10:30-5pm) that Saturday at the estate sale/gym/cafe/bookstore. It reminded me of our situationship, just without the sex. I was weirded out he got naked in front of me at the gym when he had a bf, but maybe he’s just comfortable in the locker room. I made an effort to cover up before going to the stream room. When we left for the day he suggested we grab drinks the following week to chat more about my new job.

We ended up grabbing drinks Thursday. Pretty normal, making small talk about work/weekend plans. I suggest we work out together again; he agrees and says he has stuff to do in the afternoon. But we ended up spending the day together again, chilling at a cafe to do work. 

After we workout, we hit the sauna and then I do a cold shower. I’m heaving because of the cold and he makes a quip about it. I couldn’t hear so I turn off the shower and turn around. Apparently the shower curtain was pulled back slightly, and he’s looking at me and he makes his jab.

Another awkward moment: Before we hop to another cafe we use the restroom. I get out first and wait for him outside, head buried in my phone. He comes out, slaps my ass, and I’m surprised. He laughs it off.

By now, we’ve seen each other five times in just over two weeks. He seems to constantly have plans. So I’m curious why he’s spending entire days with me. He also brings up his boyfriend in some of our conversations. 

But I am seeing blurred lines here. Most people I’ve talked to say there’s something more than “just friends” going on, though some gay guys mentioned it’s common to be friends with former flings.

I’ve been telling myself we’re just friends. Maybe he’s just super comfortable around me. He already turned down cuddling and said he had a bf, so he drew a line.

I enjoy his company and could use friends in this city and he’s familiar territory. I don’t want to ruin that. But if there’s something more going on I want to know.

Am I gaslighting myself into seeing normalcy?

TLDR: reconnected with old situationship who has a bf now. Figured we’d just be friends, but him slapping my butt and chatting with me in the showers has made me think he wants something more.

Today is the 65th anniversary of Sensei arriving in San Francisco in 1960 to launch the Kosen-rufu movement in the continental US. It’s called “SGI-USA Day.”

*MY Fantasy Life (cred: Eigenstien)*

*I am very happy that WBers informed us yesterday that Gajokai/Byakuren shifts are “a gross exploitation and a huge waste of time.” Not only exploitation but “a gross exploitation.” Not just the experience of the OP, but a categorical “huge waste of time” for ANYONE (my italics) doing them.*

*Despite the warning, we sent a carload of youth division from our group early this morning to Big City to do Gajokai/Byakuren shifts for KRG this morning. It’s even a huger waste of time for them because of the long, long drive to and from. But they were in very high spirits when they came here for a quick stop to pick up Chima. We had packed for them a couple of thermos bottles of coffee and breakfast sandwiches. And off they went to pick up N-do.*

*Chima, Veera, Emily, José, and N-do. Warding off “gross manipulation,” but till wanting to contribute to the safety and happiness of local members. We chipped in some money for gas and Buffalo wings.*

*Eulogio spoke to us for a long time last night. He is very grateful for the leaders of one of the “regions” in “New York Zone” for letting him attend their “Executive Conference” in which they learned about the initiatives for 2026.*

*There were about 40 leaders attending this region’s conference. “They all seemed very assured and happy to be there. They probably have worked together for many years. This is one of the qualities we for when teams present their ‘shark tank’ proposals to our company.”*

*A lot of the discussion was based on strengthening the districts and discussion meetings, youth developmennd building the study of the Gosho into the practice of all members.*

*We implored Eulogio to post with more information and he promised. But he has so many other things to prepare for his Managers Meeting so we will see.*

[The Miraculous Words ‘Thank You’](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/the-miraculous-words-thank-you-2/) is a spiffy article in the September 15th WT, a reprint of an essay Daisaku Ikeda wrote in 2004. The editors summarize it: “Being able to have deep appreciation for everyone around us is proof of our human revolution. Appreciation for others accelerates our inner transformation.”

Yesterday we had a 3-hour training session with the ACS caseworkers on caring for children who have been separated from their families for a variety of reasons. The mood was pretty heavy. During a break I was able to read the article and I tried to apply it throughout the day.

Daisaku Ikeda starts:

>Thank you” is a miraculous expression. It energizes us when we say it to others and encourages us when we hear it said to us. I am constantly saying “Thank you” from morning to night, every day. When I travel abroad, it is the one expression from the language of the country I am visiting that I always learn and use. Whether it is “Thank you,” “Merci,” “Danke,” “Gracias,” “Spasiba” or “Xie xie,” I put my whole heart into expressing my appreciation, looking the other person in the eye as I do so.

Hmmm. During the break, I thanked the caseworkers for the first session. They looked perplexed, like they weren’t expecting that reaction. It opened up a difficult topic and explains why they were tightly wound. 

A child, about 1 year old, was brought to the hospital because he couldn’t stand on one foot when he raised himself in his crib. It turns out there was a fraction in the foot and also a bruise. Doctors are mandated to report such events to ACS. The investigation centered on why the parents had waited three days to come to the ER; they responded that they had an appointment with their pediatrician for the following day, but decided to come to the hospital because the child was feeling discomfort. They immediately inspected the parents’ home and found a dog and feces on the floor. The parents said that they never expected to be at the ER so long and they missed walking the dog, accidents happen.

The workers told us that they decided to remove parenting rights on the spot and, after the doctor casted the baby’s foot, released him to the grandmother with the parents allowed only supervised visits.

“The parents were absolutely devastated. They stated they were targeted because they were Indigenous and this prejudiced us. ‘If this were a white family, especially middle class or above, none of this would have happened. Would we have had to wait three days to get an appointment with a doctor at the clinic? Would a family doctor report us to ACS?’” 

“We take our work very seriously and we have to make difficult choices. We have all trained for racism, classism, sexism, hidden bias. We knew there was some truth in the parents’ allegations but we still stood by our decision. All of this happened yesterday and none of us could really sleep. Hopefully the matter will be quickly resolved and if our superiors overrule us, we will gladly apologize to the parents. It weights heavily on us. But when you thanked us, for a simple training session, we felt appreciated and relieved.”

Hmmm. Who knew? 

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>When we speak or hear the words “thank you,” the armor falls from our hearts and we communicate on a deep level. “Thank you” is the essence of nonviolence. It contains respect for the other person, humility and a profound affirmation of life. It possesses a positive, upbeat optimism. It has strength. A person who can sincerely say thank you has a healthy, vital spirit; each time we say those words, our hearts sparkle and life force wells up within us.

After training, Lolita came by with Lori. Lolita told me she was so upset with herself because she had completely forgotten that she had promised the Maracles that she would watch Lori while they worked. Lolita is about the most sincere and hard-working person ever. I wanted to relieve her from the guilt. “We all make mistakes. NBD! Thank you for building such a wonderful relationship with Lori and her parents.” Again, Lolita’s entire aspect changed: face, posture, eyes.

Next thought:

>Having gratitude and appreciation for the countless people and things that support our lives—that awareness, that feeling, that joy—will invite even greater happiness. 

Yesterday Max and his crew finished the first level of the pool enclosure. It was very precise work because even a slight miscalculation at the first level would mean that the glass panels wouldn’t fit or cold air could leak through them. One full day for the first level but the rest of the entire structure will go up in a day or two. The intake/outtake pipes are installed as well. So many people to say thank you to. Max, his crew, the pool construction company, the designers of the Enclosure Company that provided such precise designs and products, the whole heat exchange HVAC industry that researched and developed heating/cooling pump technology. Thank you, thank you!

>Rather than being thankful because we are happy, being thankful itself will make us happy. Also, chanting with gratitude puts us in rhythm with the universe, turning our lives in a positive direction.

This is a big one for me. I remembered that True once told me about Mrs. Ikeda’s interview with a journalist. She was asked why she smiles so frequently. She responded that, for her, smiling is not an effect, but it’s a cause. I brought this realization to my NA meeting in the afternoon. How much gratitude I felt for my NA sponsor and the other people who come to our group! Every day is a struggle for all of us, and there are many ups and downs. But we need each other to get through another day or two. Thank you!

>When we cannot say thank you, our personal growth has stopped. When we are growing, we can see how wonderful others are too. When we stop growing, all we see are other people’s faults.

Someone posted on the sgiwhistleblowers site that irresponsible posts and comments could lead to some of the hateful shootings as we see on the news such as recent attacks on Mormons and a Manchester attack on a synagogue on Yom Kippur. The OP made an excellent point but it’s also for me. I’ve occasionally crossed lines in my criticisms of what I have read there. I can criticize ideas, but never people. I don’t have a right to be judge or executioner. I will try to be very careful from this point on.

More from Dr. Ikeda:

>At home, instead of trying to change your partner or your children to your liking, why not start with a simple “thank you”?

Exactly! Now Dr. Ikeda shares a story that I hope I can remember forever:

>There is a women’s division member who suffered from dementia in her later years, and she was unable to remember even the names of her family members. But when the doctor asked her what was the happiest moment in her life, she immediately responded: “When my daughter was born. I was so happy!” Hearing this, tears welled up in the eyes of her daughter, who was standing nearby. “Thank you,” she said. “Thank you, mother. That was all I needed to hear.”

>The daughter reflected on how she was always scolding her own son. “Yes,” she thought, “how happy I was when he was born!” Yet, over the years, driven by some mental image of an ideal child, she had tried to mold her son to fit that form, thinking only of where he didn’t measure up to the ideal and dwelling on his shortcomings in one respect or another. Still, in spite of how demanding she was, her son tried his best to live up to her expectations. He was kind to her. As these thoughts came to her, she was overcome with gratitude toward him. “Thank you. I’m just happy you are alive and well. I’m just happy you’re here beside me. Thank you.”

>She saw her son with fresh eyes, and suddenly she had so many reasons to be grateful and happy. After all, though it was hard getting her son out of bed in the mornings, he would eventually get up, even if it was sometimes at the last minute. That, in itself, was an amazing thing. He may have been a little picky about his food, and he may not have been at the top of his class, but she was just grateful he went to school and wore a bright smile each day.

>She was grateful for everything, even when nothing special happened. She was grateful for each day that passed with her family safe and well. She realized that taking so much for granted had been a symptom of a deep and pervading arrogance on her part.

It happens to be that all five of our kids are spirited. But look at their DNA: lots of local Indigenous from Dee and Eulogio, proud New Englander from Grandma Elizabeth and Afro-Mexican (!) from Uncle Miguel, Mani Greek and unbridled African American and Apache from Guy’s parents, and I’ll throw in epigenetic influence from Grandma Whoopi. With all that running in their cells, why shouldn’t the five be fire? I have to be thankful—even when I’m running around putting out their fires!

The final point for today:

>I hope that, every once in a while, you will look your partner in the eye and say thank you. Instead of eating dinner together in silence, take the time to express your appreciation. It may seem a bit embarrassing at first, but try it: you’ll see how it changes your life.

Embarrassing? Maybe even weird! I kept on thanking everyone today, especially my partners. They look at me very suspiciously. I think that will end once they read this post!

At the moment it is web/browser based and deals with the commonest 500 Latin words. But I do intend to include other word sets and make proper mobile apps. 

Please do give it a try and let me know what you think. If it’s helpful there’s even a Buy Me a Coffee link 😇

it just worries me, what if he just hasn't looked at the other photos, or just hasn't figured it out. i have literally asked 3 of my friends to look through my profile and tell me if i look the same as in the photos i put an all of them said yes, yet i'm still nervous.",5,1759666366.0,PlusSize,9,0.67,False
