1)buying something in one piece and then possibly needing to be off work to be there for the delivery people, and trying to get them to put the furniture in the correct room (they always act like I’m requesting a special favor), 
or 2)buying something that’s easily delivered to your door any time but you have to then screw together 15 pieces that don’t all fit together properly…I just can’t do it again!

And then there’s the added stress of figuring out how to get rid of the furniture being replaced most of the time. 

I’m probably being too picky but it’s really become a thing. I’ve needed a coffee table for ages but I keep envisioning scenarios similar to what I’ve experienced with getting large furniture. ",1,1742624110.0,DAE,0,1.0,False
1jh2405,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1jh2405/seeking_a_second_wife_for_my_husband/,Seeking a second wife for my husband,"Also seeking a co-wife for my husband (Sydney, Australia)

Asalamu alaikum wa rahmatulahi wa barakatuh,

First off, i wanted to thank u/cell-apprehensive23 for giving this idea of posting on this platform. The reason i am posting on this platform is because there are very limited avenues to look for people interested in polygyny. 

The reason that i am looking for a co-wife on behalf of my husband is because i feel like this may be a good way to establish trust / rapport with a potential co-wife (because a man can claim that his first wife is supportive of polygyny, but unfortunately we have heard of stories where the men have lied about this being the case, etc). If it's coming directly from a woman, i would hope that this would help put more sister's hearts at ease. 

I am looking for a co-wife for my husband. I understand we live in times where polygyny is frowned upon. I also understand we live in times where unfortunately polygyny has been associated with horror stories / conflicts / jealousy leading to bad adab (manners) from amongst co-wives.

I first want to start of with clarifying that since i embraced Islam (over 5 years ago), i started to imagine that a polygynous relationship would suit my personality. Also, i genuinely enjoy learning about the deen, and thought that with the time my husband spends with my future co-wife, i could devote that time to learning more, attending classes and increasing in good deeds for this life and the next. 

The thing is, if i were married to any other man, perhaps Allah (swt) would not have opened my heart as much to the idea of polygyny. The reason why i am supportive / encouraging him to have another wife is because i genuinely - with all my heart - want another sister to experience the ease, the love, the mercy, the compassion and the companionship my husband has given me.

We can learn alot about a man through asking their wife. My husband has never once raised his voice at me, shown his annoyance or fallen short of his responsibilities mashaAllah. If anything, he has exeeded my expectations with his gentle nature, good adab and above-average empathic personality. My husband's other strength (in addition to many) is that he is amazing with being upfront / truthful / clear with his expectations from the beginning so that no one is left guessing. In a world where people struggle to establish clear boundaries, my husband has been gifted this ability which is extremely important for a man wanting to consider polygyny. 

Knowing my husband's personality, i know that he has been gifted by Allah (swt) with the ability to take on the responsibility of having a second wife. My husband and i view having a 2nd wife as an opportunity to increase our family, increase in happiness and love for this life and the next. I pray that we can be an example of a loving and merciful family and i pray that our actions can reflect that we are people who fear Allah (swt).

Extra information about my husband (age, height, etc) can be confirmed via dm for anyone interested.

Description About My Husband (written by him):  
A healthy, active, coffee lover (barista in my free time) who is emotionally intelligent, affectionate and masculine with a solid connection to faith, family, and community.

1jh22ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1jh22ug/how_i_went_from_0_to_10k_a_month_in_savings/,How I Went from $0 to $10K a Month in Savings,"A couple of years ago, I was broke. Not just “tight on money” broke—I had no savings, no investments, and barely any idea how to manage my finances. My income was low, and my expenses felt unavoidable. But I knew I had to change. Here’s how I went from $0 to saving $10K a month.

Phase 1: Financial Wake-Up Call

At first, I didn’t even know where my money was going. So, I started tracking every dirham I spent. I used a simple spreadsheet and noted everything—food, rent, subscriptions, impulse buys. The result? I was wasting money on things I didn’t even care about.

The first major cut: eating out. I cooked at home, meal-prepped, and stopped buying coffee every morning. I canceled useless subscriptions, switched to a cheaper phone plan, and started living like I was truly broke. I wasn’t making more money yet, but by cutting unnecessary expenses, I managed to save my first $200 in the first month.

Phase 2: Increasing My Income

Saving from a low income only gets you so far. I needed to make more money.

1. Freelancing: I had some technical skills, so I started taking small gigs on Upwork and Fiverr. At first, I made $50 a week. Then $200.


2. Side Hustle: I started flipping electronics—buying used laptops, fixing them up, and reselling them for profit. This alone started making me $500 a month.


3. Job Switch: I focused on improving my tech skills and applied for better-paying jobs. After 5 months, I landed a job that paid $1,500 more per month than my old one.



At this stage, I was making $4,000/month and saving about $1,000 of it consistently.

Phase 3: Scaling My Income & Investments 

Now that I had more money coming in, I focused on saving aggressively and investing smartly.

High-Paying Clients: I took my freelancing more seriously and started working with higher-budget clients. Within months, my side income grew to $3,000/month.

Investing: I put my savings into safe but profitable investments—index funds, a few solid stocks, and even some crypto. Some months, my investments grew by $500 or more.

Automation: I set up automatic transfers—40% of my income went straight into savings and investments before I could even touch it.


By Month 18, I was earning $8,000-$10,000 a month between my job, freelancing, and investments. More importantly, I was consistently saving at least $5,000/month.

Phase 4: Hitting $10K Savings Per Month 

By now, I had built a solid financial system:
✔️ A high-paying job
✔️ A profitable freelancing business
✔️ Smart investments generating passive income
✔️ A minimalist lifestyle, avoiding lifestyle inflation

I reached a point where I was making $12K-$15K/month and comfortably saving $10K/month.

What I Learned

Tracking money is the first step. Most people are broke because they don’t know where their money goes.

Cutting expenses is great, but increasing income is key. There’s a limit to how much you can save, but no limit to how much you can earn.

Multiple income streams create financial security. A job alone wasn’t enough—I needed freelancing, investing, and side hustles.

Discipline beats motivation. I didn’t always feel like working extra hours or saving aggressively, but I did it anyway.


Now, my money works for me instead of me working for money. I don’t stress about bills, and I know I’m building real wealth.

And it all started with tracking my spending and saving my first $200.

I am slowly extinguishing this fire but you keep pulling me in and then pushing me down harder and harder every time. I am breaking down at your place while you are there with someone new in a place where I recommended. I hope you remember all of my plans for us and when you experience it with him, I hope you see my face in the crowd and ruin your day. Be original with your date plans. 

I was extremely grateful for saving me in my meltdown last night. You held me tight so that I can my feel whole again. You told me last night that you knew that you caused all of the pain that I carry now. I really do hope you finally had the conscience to admit it and be more accountable for it. 

Please don't carry the same BS attitude. Your new lover doesn't deserve your ""cool"" and nonchalant persona. For now, let me extinguish this fire. I am no longer your moon that will reflect your bright sunlight. I am no longer the warmth to your cold nights. You're just my eternal sunshine.

1jh1u2y,https://i.redd.it/wk070osrk6qe1.jpeg,An anyone help me find the author / link to read / purchase this story? My Boyfriend's Secret Match with a Fake Heiress novel,"I had assumed that my boyfriend was just busy with a family gathering, which was why he hadn’t responded to my messages on time.
Until I witnessed him peeling shrimp for another woman, smiling gently.
When I questioned their relationship, the woman let out a soft laugh.
“We're planning a wedding.”
My heart instantly turned cold, and I furiously threw a glass of wine at him.
Instead, he simply wiped his face, the corners of his mouth lifting slightly.
“You’re taking this too seriously. We were just having fun.”
My fingers curled slightly, a chill creeping into my bones.
But when I uncovered the truth, all that remained in my eyes was a mocking smirk.
They thought I was nothing more than an insignificant character?
Soon, they would realize they had messed with the wrong person.

Over Christmas, my boyfriend went back home to spend time with his parents. 

It's been three days, and I haven't heard a word from him.

Calls? Ignored.

Texts? Left on read.

He's completely vanished into thin air.

I pushed aside my unease and decided to check in myself.

As soon as I got off the plane, my bestie, Sophie, hit me up for dinner.

""Lauren, come on, please just hang out with me for a bit!""

""You don't show up in town often—at least let me treat you to dinner!""

Unable to resist her relentless nagging, I finally caved and agreed to go out with her.

But standing outside the crowded restaurant, I started to regret my decision.

As the heiress of the Rivers family, this wasn't exactly my usual scene.

With a resigned sigh, I glanced at Sophie beside me, her face glowing with excitement. 

I gave her a fond smile and followed her in.

Turning a corner, I spotted a figure that looked eerily familiar.

I shook my head. Nah, it couldn't be Brandon.

The guy had a girl clinging to his arm.

Brandon usually kept his distance from other women.

Thinking about how much care and attention he'd always shown me, I couldn't help but smile a little and brush the thought aside.

After all these years, I trusted him.

""Lauren, look how packed this place is! I told you, their food is absolutely amazing!""

Sophie, a total foodie, had ordered enough to feed a small army.

The dishes looked incredible—vibrant, flavorful, and downright mouthwatering.

We'd just started eating when a familiar voice caught my attention again.

As a waiter opened the door to a private room nearby, I got a clear view of Brandon delicately placing a peeled shrimp onto another woman's plate.

The two of them were chatting away, smiles on their faces. 

When their eyes met, her gaze practically sparkled with affection.

It felt like a bucket of ice water had been dumped over me, leaving me cold to my core.

Four years together, and Brandon had always treated me like I was his world. 

I never thought he'd betray me.

Even as I saw it with my own eyes, part of me still refused to believe it.

I sent him a quick text: What are you up to?

From across the room, I watched him glance at his phone. 

Panic flashed across his face before he flipped it over and ignored it completely.

Seeing that, I couldn't help but laugh coldly. No wonder he hadn't replied to my messages—he had someone else keeping him busy.

No one had ever dared mess with me like this before.

The word ""endure"" doesn't exist in my vocabulary. 

Fuming, I stormed toward the private room.

Sophie tried to follow, but I waved her off.

I threw open the door. Everyone inside looked at me, shocked.

Brandon froze for a moment, then his expression turned icy.

""Who told you to come here? Get out.""

""Brandon, who's this?""

The woman next to him clung to his arm and shot me a smug look.

Brandon hesitated briefly before replying in a flat tone, ""No one important. Don't worry about it. Let's just enjoy our dinner.""

The words hit me like a punch to the gut, but I forced a bitter laugh.

""No one important?""

Just a few days ago, he was calling me ""Lo."" Now I was suddenly nobody?

Fighting back the sting of betrayal, I asked again, ""Are you two on a date?""

The woman giggled and said, ""Nope. We're planning our wedding!""

I stared at Brandon, utterly incredulous.

He clenched his fists, his face turning red. 

I let out a bitter laugh, grabbed a wine glass from the table, and threw it in Brandon's face.

To my surprise, he didn't lash out.

Instead, he smirked, looking me up and down with a lazy arrogance. 

""You and I? We were just having fun. Marriage? That's for people who are… compatible.""

As he spoke, he wrapped his arm around the woman next to him.

The sight of it made my eyes sting with tears.

For the first time in my life, I'd let myself fall for someone, and this was how it ended.

I couldn't accept it. I refused to believe that four years of my life had been reduced to a joke.

""Brandon,"" I said, my voice trembling, ""you told me you wanted to marry me. You said you'd love me forever. Was that all a lie?""

I stared at him, stubbornly searching his face for even the slightest sign of hesitation.

I couldn't believe that he'd choose her—a plain-looking woman with a face full of Botox—over me.

But before Brandon could respond, the woman laughed mockingly.

Perched on her impossibly high heels, she sneered down at me. 

""It doesn't matter who he was with before. What matters is that he's going to be my husband.""

""And just so you know,"" she added with a smug smile, ""our families have a business partnership. With me as his wife, the Lane family won't have to worry about a thing.""

Hearing that, I let out a quiet sigh of relief.

So it was a business arrangement.

Looking back on Brandon's strange behavior before we parted ways, it all made sense now.

In the days leading up to his return home, he'd been unusually clingy, his eyes filled with a longing I couldn't quite understand.

I thought it was because he didn't want to leave me. 

Turns out, he had his reasons.

Arranged marriages to secure business ties weren't uncommon in our circles. 

I'd seen it plenty of times before, and I respected it.

But I never imagined it would happen to me.

The Brooks family? They were nothing compared to mine.

If I wanted, I could make sure the Brooks family didn't see another Christmas.

But I wasn't just some spoiled heiress. As the sole heir to the Rivers fortune, I had my pride.

I wasn't about to let anyone walk all over me—not even Brandon.

Still, for the sake of the love we'd shared over the past four years, I decided to give him one last chance.

""Brandon,"" I said, my voice steady, ""I know your hands are tied. But trust me, whatever you need, I can give it to you. Come with me.""

His eyes flickered with hesitation.

I waited patiently, standing there, giving him the space to decide.

But some people just love to ruin the moment.

""Who do you think you are?"" a sharp voice cut through the air.

I turned to see Mrs. Lane glaring at me with undisguised contempt.

""Do you even know where you're from? You're nothing but a gold digger from nowhere, spouting nonsense like you're someone important.""

""Even if you're capable,"" she sneered, ""you'll never measure up to the Brooks family.""

""Emily is the daughter-in-law I personally picked. She's miles ahead of you in terms of status and grace.""

Her shrill voice grated on my nerves.

The disdain in her eyes was clear as day, as though I was something beneath her notice.

It had been a long time since anyone dared to look at me like that.

As the darling of the Rivers family in New York, people usually bent over backward to please me.

This was the first time I'd ever been so openly dismissed.

Maybe I'd been too low-profile.

Back in school, I'd downplayed my background to avoid unnecessary trouble, pretending I came from an average family.

Even after dating Brandon for years, I'd never told him the truth about my family.

When we went out, he never let me pay for anything. 

We were just like any other couple—grabbing coffee, taking walks, enjoying each other's company.

Who would've thought that would make them look down on me?

Even so, I kept my gaze fixed on Brandon.

I didn't care about the others. Their opinions were irrelevant.

The only one I cared about was him.

I just wanted to know what he was thinking.

His hesitation was written all over his face, clear for everyone to see.

Sensing this, Emily leaned in and whispered something in his ear.

Whatever she said, it seemed to snap him out of it.

He looked at me like a man walking to his execution.

""Lauren Rivers, you're not good enough for me. These past few years, I was just toying with you because you were so obedient and sweet.""

""My wife? That's going to be Emily.""

""We're getting married right after the holidays. Don't bother me again.""

To make his point, he leaned over and kissed Emily on the forehead—right in front of me.

The people around us chuckled, their faces smug and full of amusement.

Me? I felt dead inside.

But as the heiress of the Rivers family, I'm not the type to cling to something that's already gone.

Sure, I took a hit this time, but I don't let people walk all over me.

As the sole heir to my family's fortune, I've never been one to forgive and forget.

If you cross me, I'll make sure you regret it.

And this time? This time, they messed with my heart.

I let out a cold laugh, pulled out my phone, and sent Sophie a quick text from the room across the hall.

I needed to figure out exactly what was going on here.

When I didn't leave right away, Emily gave me a sneering look. 

""Oh, look, a little country girl. What's the matter? Calling for backup?""

I ignored her taunt, calmly typing out instructions for what to do next.

Emily must've taken my silence as a challenge because she snatched my phone and smashed it onto the floor.

""Hey, I'm talking to you! Are you deaf?""

I raised my head, locking eyes with her.

The intensity in my gaze made her stumble back a step.

Realizing what she'd done, she turned red with anger and raised a hand to slap me.

But that slap never landed.

Instead, a tall figure stepped in front of me, shielding me from the blow.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't moved.

""Emily,"" Brandon said, his voice cautious, ""this is supposed to be a happy day.""

'My parents are here, and we shouldn't let outsiders ruin it. Let's just have her leave and get back to business.""

This was the same carefree, lively guy I used to know, now reduced to tiptoeing around another woman.

Even as I tried to keep my composure, I couldn't help the ache in my chest.

And Brandon's attempts to smooth things over only made Emily even more smug.

She clapped her hands, and a few bodyguards stepped forward, surrounding me.

""You think you can just walk away? Not so fast.""

Emily grinned at me like a cat about to pounce, then grabbed a nearby dish and threw it to the ground, shattering it at my feet.

""Get on your knees, pick up every piece, and maybe I'll let you go. Oh, and I'll throw in ten grand. How does that sound?""

Her voice dripped with arrogance, like she was addressing something beneath her notice.

This wasn't about the money; it was about trampling on my pride.

I'd done things like this to people before.

Now, being on the receiving end, I had to admit—it felt strangely ironic.

I knew that if I did as she asked, she'd probably stomp on my hands with those ridiculously high heels of hers.

Then she'd toss a credit card in my face and laugh, calling me a gold digger who dared to dream above her station.

The thought of it was almost comical.

Before I could respond, Brandon finally spoke up.

""Emily, don't forget what you promised me.""

Her expression flickered with jealousy for a split second.

I frowned. Was there something about this situation that I didn't know?

Before I could piece it together, Mrs. Lane yanked Brandon back.

""Why are you wasting time on some nobody from the middle of nowhere?"" she snapped.

""Picking up those shards will get her ten grand. She should be thrilled.""

""It's probably more than she makes in a year.""

The others at the table couldn't help chiming in with agreement.

Brandon's dad even praised Emily, calling her ""kind-hearted.""

Honestly, these parents were a piece of work.

It was impressive that Brandon had managed to grow up as a cheerful, outgoing guy.

Too bad he was also indecisive and easily manipulated.

""Ten grand isn't nothing,"" Emily sneered. 

""You probably don't even make that in a year. Why don't you get down there and start picking up the pieces?""

I shifted my gaze to Brandon.

Our eyes met, and for a moment, I saw pain and guilt in his expression.

But just as quickly, it vanished.

The next second, he yanked free of his mom's grip, strode over to me in a few quick steps, and shoved me to the ground.

""I've already told you, you're not good enough to be a part of this family. Stop clinging to me like a leech. Have some dignity, will you?""

My palms scraped against the ground, the sting making me wince.

But his words hurt far worse, and I couldn't stop the tears that welled up in my eyes.

Before I could even react, Brandon grabbed me again, roughly pulling me to my feet.

He dragged me to the door of the private room and shoved me out.

""Get lost! I don't ever want to see you again. You make me sick!""

With a loud slam, the door closed behind me, cutting me off from the laughter and voices inside.

Sophie heard the commotion and hurried over to help me up.

""Lauren, I just found out—there's more to this than we thought,"" she said, her face pale.

Looking at her expression, I could already tell that whatever she'd uncovered wasn't good news.

When I looked over the information she'd dug up, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Brandon, you idi//ot.

He'd been completely played by his own parents.

No wonder he'd been dodging his mom's calls right before Christmas.

He was trying to protect me.

Now that I understood the whole picture, things were much clearer.

I waved for the waitstaff to clear the table and had them bring out a new spread of food.

""You said this place had great food, right? Stop spacing out and dig in!""

I snapped my fingers in front of Sophie, breaking her daze.

""Oh, uh, yeah,"" she said, snapping out of it and starting to eat.

We ate our fill, and just as we were finishing, the door to the private room across the hall opened.

Everyone inside was all smiles, clearly pleased with whatever had just been discussed.

Emily was clinging to Brandon's arm, her face glowing with smug satisfaction.

But the moment she saw me, her smile vanished.

""Oh, look who's back,"" she sneered. 

""I let you off easy earlier, and now you're crawling back? Can't stay away, huh? Guess you really want to spice up my big day.""

She signaled to the bodyguards nearby, and two of them came forward to grab me.

""This time, not even God Himself could save you,"" she said with a nasty grin.

I laughed coldly, unbothered by her bravado. 

""Brandon, I know your mom and the Brooks family are using my safety to control you.""

""But trust me, if you leave with me right now, I'll handle everything.""

At first, I thought this whole situation was just about business—a marriage of convenience.

But it turned out, I was the real reason behind all of this.

Sophie had uncovered the truth: over the past two years, Brandon had repeatedly refused his parents' attempts to marry him off for the sake of their business.

But the Lane family's finances were in shambles. 

They won't last long without an infusion of cash.

So when Emily's family offered a partnership in exchange for marriage, it must've seemed like a golden opportunity.

Mrs. Lane jumped at the chance, of course.

But Brandon loved me too much to go along with it. 

He wasn't willing to marry anyone else.

Emily, desperate to win him over, and Mrs. Lane, eager for the money, joined forces and came up with the perfect plan: they threatened my life to force his hand.

Looking back, it all made sense.

The car accident that nearly hit me? 

The flowerpot that ""accidentally"" fell from above?

Brandon had been terrified, sticking to me like glue to keep me safe.

I'd thought I was just unlucky, but now I saw the truth.

They wanted me gone.

My words made Emily and Mrs. Lane's faces twist with anger.

Mrs. Lane let out a cold snort and turned to Brandon, her tone sharp and mocking.

""She's just a little girl. What could she possibly do?""

""Are you really going to risk everything for some fling?""

At that, Brandon's gaze hardened.

""You don't get it, do you?"" he snapped, his voice rising. 

""We're done. I don't love you anymore. Leave me alone!""

He practically shouted the last part.

Emily, of course, looked even more triumphant.

""Oh, you're not going anywhere,"" she said, smirking. 

""Now that you've come to me, you're staying right here.""

""The Brooks family just opened a new club. With a face like yours, I'm sure the guys there would pay handsomely for your time,"" Emily sneered.

""Take her there and get her out of my sight. That way, she won't keep coveting what isn't hers.""

At her words, Brandon shoved aside the bodyguards restraining me and gave me a hard push toward the door.

""Get out of here, or else don't blame me for what happens next…""

Before he could finish, Emily's hand whipped across his face.

""Don't think I don't know what's really going on in your head,"" she hissed.

""If you ruin my mood today, I'll make sure none of you have a good time.""

Brandon's dad stepped in, slapping him across the face as well. 

Together with his wife, they dragged him aside.

""Emily's right,"" Mr. Lane said coldly. 

""That girl doesn't know her place. She needs to be taught a lesson.""

Looking at this group of sanctimonious hypocrites, I couldn't hold back a mocking laugh.

""Well, well, Miss Brooks, such boldness!""

""Of course!"" she shot back, tilting her chin as if she were a queen.

With that, she instructed her bodyguards to drag me to the club.

But they didn't get far before someone rushed over and stopped them.

The man kicked one of the bodyguards away, his stance protective as he turned to me.

""Miss Rivers, are you all right? It's clear that Emily and her family didn't know who they were dealing with. On their behalf, I sincerely apologize.""

I raised an eyebrow, looking at him in confusion.

He immediately straightened up and explained, ""I'm James Brooks—Emily's brother.""

It was obvious from his fawning tone that he knew exactly who I was.

I knew why he was acting so subservient, even if Emily didn't.

""What are you doing, James?"" Emily snapped, glaring at him. 

""How can you take her side? She's just a homewrecker trying to steal someone else's man!""

The moment the words left her mouth, James slapped her hard across the face.

The impact was loud and brutal, leaving her cheek visibly swollen.

""James, what are you doing?!"" Emily screamed, clutching her face.

But James didn't bother responding. Instead, he turned back to me, bowing his head repeatedly in apology.

The others were still too stunned to react, but Mr. Lane, with his years of experience in corporate maneuvering, quickly regained his composure.

His expression turned serious as he addressed James, pointing at me. 

""Who… is she?""

James's face darkened as he shot him a glance. 

""She's the heiress of the Rivers family. Someone you absolutely cannot afford to mess with.""

1jh1tue,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jh1tue/im_jealous_of_my_friend_and_heartbroken_over_it/,"I'm jealous of my friend, and heartbroken over it","This ones probably going to be long and im honestly not sorry about it. I'm a 28f, and my longest friend that I have known since we were 3, also 28f, and I'm jealous of her relationships with other people. 

We grew up in the same city, didn't even go to the same school, but saw each other at least once a month if not more. Spent the night at each other's houses every other month or monthly alternating houses. And as we get older and got our own cars, hung out whenever possible with our schedules. So its safe to say that we were close growing up. 7 years ago, I moved to a city 3.5 hours way to pursue school and my now career. To commemorative our long lasting friendship and love for each other, we got a matching tattoo. Same spot on our bodies and everything. 

Since then, I have seen her in person 4 times. Our schedules just never really aligned when I would come back to visit family or when she would be coming to my area. 

Throughout all that, we still maintained contact via video and phone calls that would always last 3+ hours each time. So we haven't kept as regular contact as we used to, but that's also due to our schedules never really lining up. 

Despite all that, I helped her through the roughest break up and trauma from that. I was the first person she called when things were getting bad, the first person she told she was going to break up with him, always the first person. So despite no longer living within 15 minutes of each other, I was still her rock. 

Now I know distant is obviously an issue for being able to see her often, and I can't be the first person she thinks about when she does stuff. But I see her posting on Instagram all the time about who she's out with and what they're doing. And every time I see it, I get jealous that it's not me that's doing that with her. The last couple years our contact has slowed and we dont call or video as often as we used to when I first moved. And when we do, it's not the hours long chats it used to be. Maybe an hour at most. I know time and distance make it hard to up keep friendships, but it really stings when I see her doing all these things with other people when I can't be there to join. It's even harder when I see her posting about doing a 2 hour road trip to see another friend fairly often and she can't be bothered to drive the extra 1.5 hours to see me or make an effort to see if I'd be willing to meet halfway. I've tried to do that in reverse just to see if it would work, but never does. She's been within an hour drive of me and didn't say anything but knowing I'd be willing to drive the hour just to even have a quick coffee with her. And that's what breaks my heart. It's starting to feel more and more like a one sided friendship every time we talk. 

She recently got engaged to her bf of 3.5 years, and I was lucky enough to get the friend video call showing off the ring and was extremely happy for them. And growing up we always talked about how we would be each other MOH. And in a previous video chat about 1.5-2 years ago when they started getting serious, I had said that hey I understand what the MOH position really is and with me being so far now I understand if you don't want me to be in that position considering how difficult it would be for me to do things. And she had said that she'd still have me in her wedding party, but looking at how things are now, I'm not even sure that would happen. I wouldn't be surprised at this point if I was just  invited as a regular guest. And that also breaks my heart, even though I know it's not my day. 

I'm visiting my family in a week, and have planned to see her, so we do have plans. But I'm just not sure it's going to be the same as it was. 

I do love her, and I always will love her. And no matter what I will always be someone she can come to with anything. But I'm jealous of her more active friendships that she has, and am also so heartbroken over the loss of our friendship and what it used to be. I know she'll always be in my life, and I'll always be in hers. But not in the way I thought it would be. ",3,1742622940.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Context: So, I met this guy (28 M) online (sa gaming) around May 2024. He asked for my telegram so we could talk there because we really enjoyed each other’s company while playing online. At first, I wasn’t expecting to have a deep connection with this person but as time passed, I felt like I could really connect with him because of our common interests. 

So, one day he asked me out (July 2024) to on a coffee date. It went well, so I went out with him again a couple of other times. Around September 2024, we went out again on a date and we went to his condo after to rest. Okay naman, nagkukwentuhan kami until he started to kiss me torridly and nadala kami both and we ended up having seggs. After that night, I thought magtutuloy-tuloy. But he ghosted me after 3 days. He ghosted me for a month. 

And so I started to stalk him on social media. Iba yung name niya sa pakilala niya sa akin but nahanap ko pa rin bilang fbi ang mga babae. In his facebook, nakita ko na mag girlfriend siya for 8 years na. Medyo na-hurt ako. But more than that, I felt sorry for the girl.

One good cup and you’ll realize you’ve been drinking hot brown frozen sadness for years. After this, the regret of bad beans you “promise to drink later” will be history.

---
**2. We Don’t Hold Your Hand**  
We don't perscribe to one “coffee mantra” over another. Most of these circle jerks happen on other subreddits and they fight about stupid things that DON'T MATTER. We source elite beans. You bring a grinder and some respect. If you want to be glazed, go back to [r/pourover](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover).

---
**3. We Don’t Give AF**  
No guilt emails. No manipulative discounts. Buy what you want, when you want. We won’t chase you, we’ve got coffee to pack.

---
**4. Your Cafe Will Taste Like Regret**  
Once you’ve brewed something fresh and properly sourced from the best roasters on the planet, that \$9 oat milk pour-over down the street will taste like a warm mistake.

---
**5. We Actually Charge Fairly**  
We work with the best roasters, but we’re not here to fleece you. No outrageous markups for stickers and “aesthetic” boxes. No \$32 for a 250g bag + international shipping of coffee you can’t even taste before you buy.

---
**6. You’ll Become *That* Person**  
Suddenly you’re saying things like, “This Panama is singing,” and judging your friends’ grinders. They’ll think you’re pretentious. You’ll be right. Love the seriousness, fun playfullness, but don’t take this so serious, its okay to not give AF all at the same time.

---
**7. Too Many Good Options**  
We rotate the best of the best. If you’re the type that panics over a big menu, this might break you.

---
**8. We Make It Too Easy**  
No importing hassle. No mystery shipping timelines. Just top-tier beans, freshly roasted, delivered to your door. If you crave pain with your coffee, sorry we’re efficient. (But we’re not Amazon, so please don't email us 24 hours after purchase about your order not having a tracking over the weekend)

---
**9. Other Coffee Stops Hitting**  
After experiencing Rotation, everything else feels flat. You’ll sip a cup from your old favorite spot and think, “Did this always taste like boiled disappointment?”

---
**10. We Don’t Want Your Soul**  
No loyalty program. No “coffee points.” No sneaky upsells. Just a fair exchange of beans for money. Shocking, we know. (Although to get into the beta, you gotta prove you’re about the coffee life. I’m not packing orders till midnight for some shmuck who thinks I need his money. This is for the *obsessed*.)

---
**11. We’re Not Corporate. At All.**  
Rotation is self-funded, self-packed, self-shipped. We’ll screw up eventually, and we’ll fix it. But if you show up crying over a bent label or a delay during a snowstorm, know that we’re open to real feedback… but not to petty, fake criticism.  

I love what we’ve got going here at Rotation, but it’s *not* for everyone. So please, never buy!",3,1742621557.0,coffeerotation,0,1.0,False
1jh1hn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBAaspirants/comments/1jh1hn8/why_you_are_not_a_good_manager_take_on_your/,Why You Are Not a Good Manager:  Take on Your Managerial Mishaps,"Arre bhai, so you think you’re the next big-shot manager, ready to rule the corporate jungle? Chal, btata hu tujhee. Being a manager isn’t just about sipping coffee in a fancy cabin or barking orders like some Bollywood villain. It’s a skillset, yaar, and chances are, you’re missing a few screws in that department. Let’s break it down, with a little masala, and see why you’re probably not the “best boss ever….and what you can learn from some epic fails, like the disaster that was Blockbuster. Haan, woh wala Blockbuster jo ab history ka part hai!



1. You’re a Control Freak, **Not a Leader**

Boss, if you’re the type who micromanages every chhota-mota task—like telling your team exactly how to format an email or hovering over their shoulder while they type—newsflash: you’re not a manager, you’re a babysitter with a tie. Good managers delegate, not dictate. They trust their team to get the job done without playing Big Brother 24/7.



Example: Imagine Ravi, the guy who insists on approving every single line of code his developers write. End result? His team spends more time waiting for his ""okay"" than actually coding. Project delayed, clients pissed, and Ravi still thinks he’s the hero. Bhai, chill karo thoda!



Skill You’re Missing: Trust. Learn to let go, yaar. A good manager builds a team they can rely on, not a bunch of puppets.



2. Communication? Kya Hai Yeh?

If your idea of communication is sending vague emails like “Do the needful” or grunting “Fix it” in meetings, then congrats, you’re a walking disaster. Good managers articulate goals clearly—nahi toh team kya karega? Guess karne ka game khelega? 



Example: Take Priya, who told her sales team to “improve performance” without explaining how or why. Two months later, half the team was selling random stuff online, and the other half was just napping. Total chaos, boss!



Skill You’re Missing: Clarity. Be specific, bolo what you want, or your team will drown in confusion.



3. Emotional Intelligence? Zero Pe Zero

Arre, if you can’t tell when your team is stressed out or ready to mutiny, you’re not managing—you’re just sitting on a ticking time bomb. Good managers read the room, not just the revenue charts. If someone’s crying in the bathroom, maybe don’t yell at them for missing a deadline that day.



Example: Meet Sanjay, who thought shouting “You’re all useless!” during a bad quarter would “motivate” his team. Spoiler: Half of them quit, and the other half started a WhatsApp group called “Sanjay Sucks.” Well played, Sanjay!



Skill You’re Missing: Empathy. Thodi si insaniyat dikhao, bhai. People aren’t robots.



4. Vision? Bhai, abee yaar marvel waala nhi!!!!

A manager without a vision is like a car without a steering wheel—crash guaranteed. If you’re just reacting to problems instead of planning ahead, you’re not leading, you’re firefighting. Good managers set goals, inspire, and show the way, not just stumble around like a lost puppy.



Example: Look at Neha, who ran her startup like a daily soap opera—fixing one crisis after another, no long-term plan. Guess what? Her company shut down in two years because she had no clue where she was going. Vision nahi, toh business bhi nahi!



Skill You’re Missing: Strategic Thinking. Soch samajh ke chalna padta hai, boss.



**Epic Fail Case Study**: BLOCKBUSTER Ki kese lanka dubiii

Ab thodi si history suno. Blockbuster, the video rental giant, was once the king of entertainment. But their managers? Total bakwas decision-makers. In 2000, Netflix offered to sell itself to Blockbuster for $50 million. Blockbuster’s bosses laughed it off—Netflix? Yeh chhota startup kya karega? Fast forward, Netflix is a streaming monster worth billions, and Blockbuster is a ghost story we tell to scare bad managers.



\*What Went Wrong\*: No vision, no adaptability. Blockbuster stuck to its old-school rental model while the world moved to digital. Their managers didn’t see the future, didn’t innovate, and didn’t listen to the market. Result? Game over, bhai.



\*Lesson for You\*: Don’t be a Blockbuster. Adapt, think ahead, or get ready to shut shop.



5. You Think You’re the MaDaFaKa Star, Not the Team

Last but not least, if you’re hogging all the credit and treating your team like background dancers in your success story, you’re doomed. Good managers lift others up, not just themselves. Team ka success hi manager ka success hai, samjhe?



\*Example\*: Vikram, the “I did it all” manager. His team worked 80-hour weeks to hit a target, but at the company party, Vikram took the mic and said, “I made this happen.” Next month, his best employees jumped ship. Karma, boss!



\*Skill You’re Missing\*: Humility. Thoda sa credit baant do, yaar—team khush, tum bhi khush.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Toh bhai, if you’re missing these skills—trust, clarity, empathy, vision, and humility—don’t be shocked if your team secretly calls you “The Disaster” behind your back. Management isn’t a title; it’s a vibe. So, next time you’re tempted to micromanage or yell, yaad rakho Blockbuster ka haal. Shape up, or ship out, boss!",4,1742621524.0,MBAaspirants,4,1.0,False

When looking to elevate the style and functionality of your living space, a furniture set 5 piece can be the perfect solution. These versatile sets often include essential pieces that work harmoniously together, providing both aesthetic appeal and practical use. A well-chosen 5-piece furniture set can transform any room into a cozy retreat or a vibrant entertaining area.

A typical furniture set 5 piece may consist of a combination of a sofa, chairs, and a coffee table, all designed to complement one another in both design and color scheme. For instance, a contemporary set might feature a sleek, modern sofa paired with two stylish armchairs, along with a chic coffee table that serves as the focal point of the room. This arrangement not only maximizes seating but also enhances the overall decor, making it visually appealing.

Another advantage of opting for a furniture set 5 piece is the ease of coordination. Purchasing a complete set eliminates the hassle of mismatched pieces, ensuring a cohesive look across your living area. Furthermore, many sets come in various styles, including rustic, modern, or minimalist, catering to diverse tastes while offering flexibility to blend with existing furnishings.

Cost-effectiveness is another significant benefit of a 5-piece furniture set. Buying multiple pieces as a package typically offers considerable savings compared to purchasing individual items separately. This makes it an appealing option for those on a budget looking to furnish their home stylishly.

In summary, a furniture set 5 piece is an ideal choice for homeowners and renters alike to achieve a stylish and functional living environment. With the right selection, you can enhance your space while enjoying the convenience of coordinated furniture that reflects your personal style.

and as I will change the quantity of coffee for one cup (as compared to 3 cups)I have heard people say that the brew will be inconsistent as the best potential you can get out of your Moka pot is by filling the basket up to the brim. But if I feel it up to the brim, the quantity would be for 3 cups rather than 1.

1jh10wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadyOrNotGame/comments/1jh10wf/i_thought_i_could_handle_it/,I thought I could handle it,"... I couldn't.

Before I picked up RoN a few weeks ago, my milsim-esque gaming was limited to the likes of ArmA3, Ground Branch and the ilk. SWAT4 was the most realistic game which made me feel emotions other than rage and anger (Screw the AAF). But for the most part SWAT4 failed to incite any emotions in me except for that hospital-level... it made me feel disgust but nothing more. Maybe it's because I have grown in the past two years, maybe it's because I have been having these...pangs, for the lack of a better word, of being a father (yeah at the ripe old age of 18) or maybe it's just because I have found a friend circle which has brought me in touch with my feelings... RoN made me feel. And feel hard. While the gas station level was not particularly noteworthy, I first felt...distressed in the cryptofarm raid. Seeing one of these barely older-than-me adults clutch at his throat as blood spurted out... I felt detached but sad. Like truly sad.

As I progressed through the game, I encountered several such instances where I would feel distress... slight sickening in my stomach. Then I played Valley of the Dolls. Just the tablet description charged me up... I wanted this, I needed this OP to be successful on first try. As AI and I swept through the mansion bombarded by the erotic I felt sick...but a different. I felt rage when I saw the poolside happy 18th birthday frame. Guards fell as me and my crew tore through them like a hot knife through butter. Then we reached the climax... the photo dev studio thing... and I had to pause. As I said, I felt sick right? Well my cholera became ebola now. I damn near executed that fucking ""artist"".

Then came the Elephant. Took me two tries. The first try because well I couldnt find the bombs. But this was a very very hard level, not in terms of gameplay, I found the crypto raid and the mail raid harder...but this was hard because it was too damn familiar. Im a first-year college student and when I heared that 911 call...the barista sounded too much like a friend of mine... it was very uncomfortable. And then I saw myself standing outside Watt Community College... for some sick reason my mind flashed images of my college. We rushed through the hallways, the AI and I, stopping for no one, defusing bombs, securing students and teachers and gunning down the shooters. Then I got hit with a penalty. A hostage was executed. The gunshot came from nearby and we ran towards it and I saw something that made me stop. A girl was dead, leaning against a water cooler thingy, her face bloodied... zipties around her hands. We put her in that position. I did.

And I'm not being dramatic here...a lone, warm salty drop rolled down my fat cheek. And then rang another shot. Fuck, I thought. We tore across the hallway and dropped the final shooter in the coffee shop. Another ziptied civilian dead. Again, because of me. I froze up.

I dont know whats the point of this post...I exited the game after getting my B. I don't think I'll be playing anytime soon in the next few hours. I just needed to vent. Maybe I'll play a little FC25 now. 

Thank you for listening to my rant if you did.

He fell into a deep depression, turning to the solace of the only friend he felt he could trust: Mr. Jim Beam. It was the better part of a year before he really shook off the blues, broke himself out of the bottle that had become his prison, and got back on his feet by focusing on his studies. Determined to make a better life for himself, he worked hard, he started dating again, he had fun times, and sowed a wild oat or two along the way. He graduated with a 3.8 GPA and degree in business administration. He got a boring but fruitful job with the Harkins and Associates Consulting Firm right out of college where he excelled, and started earning a good living. He eventually met Shirley. She was a few years older, worked at the Denny's where he used to drink coffee and study well into the nights throughout his senior year. She carried herself with a worldly wit and these deep brown eyes that he could just get lost in. She was warm and caring, ready for a partner to build a life with. They eventually moved into together, and he found real love for the first time in years. She had a son named Leo from a previous relationship. Guy was out of the picture. But Leo was a good kid, bit of a scamp; desperately needed a father figure in his life. They hit it off in no time, playing ball, fishing, even taught him how to change a tire and talk to girls. One day, looking in the mirror, he realized he'd found quite the little life for himself. Even though the years had weathered him a bit, his hairline was fading back, and his once rugged and youthful jawline had rounded, yielding to the slightest second chin; he was truly happy with the man he'd become. For he wasn't that boy running to get punch for that girl at the prom anymore. That girl? What was her name again? It was such a distant and faded memory. But he felt like he should know. That was the moment the first warning sign of early onset dimensia became apparent. His memory would slip rapidly over the course of the following years, but even as a man far too young for such a grizly fate slipped away from the domain of the astute world, the deep brown eyes of his love Shirley always brought him comfort. Even when he couldn't remember her name or who she was; he could always understand the loving sadness in those eyes, and he would've given anything to make it better. But alas, just 17 days before his 47th birthday, he ultimately succumbed to the disease that robbed him slowly and mercilessly of everything he was.",1,1742619629.0,AntiJokes,0,1.0,False

After you spent a year, going to doctors appointments paying countless co-pays, getting evaluated, financially preparing and thinking about redoing your will just in case. You’ve now recovered and your DBS device is on and working. After you have spent 20 years adjusting, assimilating, and over compensating for the loss of your motor skills. It took 20 years to cope with the loss of your handwriting, with the ability to use chopsticks, do your make up, tie your shoes, hold a cup of coffee, hold a martini or a cosmopolitan. 
How to cope with being ok. One of the best things I did was start talk therapy during this process. Because it is difficult to stop worrying. It is difficult to adjust to the new reality that you are OK. That you can stop adjusting. So please take time to reflect and know that you’re amazing, you were strong, and resilient. All of these things happen so gradually we accommodate assimilate and adjust so gradually that when all said and done, and you sit down and you take inventory of everything that you have gone through, you just have to be proud of yourself.

I won't mention some characters like Disney's bambi, who i am certain will be public domain by 2038. BF and GF from Friday Night Funkin' aren't Public domain but were released through the Apache license, which is a more complicated variation of Creative Commons free use.   
""\*"" denotes a special entry that may have unique importance or clarification.  
Please let me know in the comments your thoughts on the characters we have, and the ones yet to come for the PD! i'd like to hear you guys out for the future of Public domain content.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_    

In the public domain-  

* King kong (1932, via novelization that came before the movie which had no notice. However, caution should be taken, as the character is prone to very idiotic trademark issues from its parent companies. Film version will not be available until 2029.)  
* Pinnochio (1880s italian novels and children's tales, Disney version will be available in 2035 though it had a comic adaptation and radio drama a year prior to the film's debut.)
* Cthulhu (H.P. lovecraft anthology tales from 1928 to 1957, with the 46 Lovecraft stories from ***weird tales*** having been left unrenewed of protection or notices. Later collaborated stories between Lovecraft and other authors remain under protection.)
* Conan the barbarian (1932, through two stories that never had copyright renewed. additionally, all conan-related stories E. howard published during his lifetime are in the public domain. later stories, including the more noteworthy film adaptation, are still protected until expiration.)
* Dr. Seuss's The Sneetches and The Zaks (both appeared in two instances of the Redbook Magazine in its 50s prior to Dr. Seuss publishing his tales as standalone children's books, both did not either have a copyright notice or copyright renewed.)
* Zorro (Via the first few books and films from around 1919 and Curse of Capistrano. Unlike Kong however, he may be more open to use with little risk despite having had Trademark issues in the past.)
* Sherlock Holmes (first in the 1887 novel, then all the way to the last tale from Arthur conan doyle entering PD in 2023)
* Peter Rabbit (via 1902 book for children)
* Winnie the Pooh and Friends (A.A. Milne's 1920s Novels, with the later characters like Tigger entering public domain in 2024. UK unfortunately will have to wait until 2047 to use the characters, with Disney's versions entering the public domain around the 2060s.)
* Sam Spade (from the short stories of ""The Maltese Falcon"" and The Black mask, which entered public domain 2025. Court also ruled that Sam spade was ineligible for copyright due to not meeting the requirements at the time needed for protection due to his minimal role.)
* Dumbo (Yes, THAT dumbo the flying elephant, who actually originated from a set of VERY RARE sketches for an unpublished Children's story book that DID get registered and therefore fell under 70+ years after for unpublished works on an author's death. the Surviving illustrations are all that remain from the 1939 book for anyone to use dumbo.)
* Hercule Poirot (Belgian detective character from the 1920 novel ""The Mysterious Affairs at Style"". While already PD in the US, he doesn't unfortunately enter PD for UK audiences until 2047.)
* Miss Marple (a fair detective damsel from the 1927 tale featured on the Royal Magazine. While already PD in the US, she doesn't enter PD in the UK until 2047.)
* Simon templar the Saint (from the 1928 Novel ""Meet the Tiger"", already entered PD in the US, but doesn't become PD in the UK until 2064.)
* Mary Poppins (From the 1927 iteration to 1930s stories. Later more refined incarnation will not enter public domain until 2030 for US, while UK has to wait until 2067 for both iterations.)
* Ronald Mcdonald (from the 1963 commercial, which was a sort of prototypical design in testing before we got the more recognizable look. Due to being an advertising mascot, using Ronald poses a large trademark infringement risk from the Mcdonalds corporation. Is in the public domain due to a missing copyright notice.)
* Keystone Cops (from the 1912 comedy skits)
* The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin's iconic fictional persona, first seen in 1914)
* Laurel and Hardy (from the 1927 comedy film, a British gag duo)
* \*Ro-man (Aka Robot Monster from the 1953 film, while it's said that the film was renewed for copyright, the company that owns him illegally renewed copyright for various other films they owned, meaning they would be invalid to issue Copyright strikes or court issues due to misusing copyright law. The monster appears in a game based on Manos the hands of fate without issue; otherwise, it enters public domain in 2049.)
* Peg-leg Pete (from the 1925 cartoon ""Alice solves the Puzzle"", originally was a bear before becoming a feline-based character which became PD in 2024-2025.)
* Various Rudolph-characters (from the 1964 stop-motion special, which accidentally was given an invalid copyright spelling. Rudolph himself as well as songs predating the special have yet to enter the public domain.)
* Bosko (from the 1929-1930s cartoons, the first looney tunes character. Most of his cartoon appearances around that time were not renewed. If you intend to revive the character, it is important to remove or replace any semblance of racist caricatures/blackface to be respectful to the audience.)
*  Tweety (from the looney tunes short ""A Tale of two Kitties"", though originally prototypically depicted as a pink feather-less bird named Orson with black pupils. Orson would be renamed Tweety in the 1944 cartoon ""Birdy and the beast"" and wouldn't become yellow until ""Tweetie pie"", which has yet to enter the public domain.)
* Dan Backslide and the Dover boys (most famously known in the 1942 short, which lapsed in copyright due to failure to renew protection.)
* Casper the friendly ghost (from the 1945 cartoon. The children's book he was meant to first appear in went unpublished, but the first cartoon featuring him failed to have copyright renewed. Later appearances and Characters will remain protected until then.)
* Calvin & Colonel (a cartoon animal duo that first appeared in the 1961 episode ""The television Job"", much of the TV cartoon series fell into the public domain due to failure to renew copyright.)
* Felix the cat (from the 1919 short ""feline follies"", many cartoons up to 1929 are in the public domain.)
* Oswald the lucky rabbit (UB Iwerk's iconic character from the 1927-1929 cartoons, most of which unfortunately have become lost media. His appearances from then on to 1929 have fallen into the public domain in 2023-2025.)
* Jor-L and Lora (Superman's Parents from the Superman comic strip of 1939. Despite Superman still having yet to enter the public domain in 2034, his parents as well as the planet krypton and its race inhabitants are free to use as the comic strips did not have properly placed Copyright.)
* Captain Atom (Charlton comics superhero later adopted by DC comics. While later appearances in DC media are protected, the Charlton comics are infamously known to have been abandoned and did not renew copyright.)

* Blue beetle (From the first issue of Mystery men comics, the first two identities of the hero are public domain, but the Jaime Reyes counterpart is still protected by copyright.)

He was inspired by the character Andy Hardy, from the 1928 Stage-play ***Skidding*** which also recently fell into public domain.)
* Gnorm Gnat (from the 1973 comic strips by Jim Davis, notable by hardcore Garfield fans for being a failure that led to the eventual success in Comic strip history. None of the strips nor the newspaper they appeared in had published copyright notices.)
* Garfield and Jon Arbuckle (YES, the duo that kicked off Comic strip history gold, are in the public domain thanks to the 1976-1978 ""Jon"" strips lacking copyright notices. Jon's notable acquaintances Irma, Lyman, as well as Liz are also included, with Odie originally being a pet owned by Lyman named Spot and Garfield's teddy bear Pookie being known as Huggy.

* Popeye (the iconic sailor of 1929's thimble theatre strips who entered public domain in 2025. While he originally gained his super strength from plucking the feathers of a rare exotic bird, his power to buff up from eating spinach came from a 1931 comic strip that did not have copyright renewed, meaning he can be depicted becoming powered up from eating the food.)
* \*Brutus \[AKA- Chauncey/Junior\] (the TV-counterpart and later canonical brother of Bluto in the Popeye series, first appearing in the 1960s pilot TV cartoon episode ""Barbeque for two"". The pilot did not have its copyright renewed at the time.

* Baby Shark (an unknown 20th century children's song icon, described as a juvenile shark living in a family full of other sharks. Due to its origin being largely shrouded in mystery, its moreso a folklore tale than a copyrighted idea.)
* \*MissingNo. (A glitched corrupted entity from the first two Pokémon games manifested from garbled code upon performing a special sequence to activate a glitch encounter. While Pokémon as a game still very much is protected, Missingno. is just a glitch and legally considered an AI-produced work, being legal in the US and most of the nation as a result. So long as you're not in a country that protects AI-generated works and don't associate Missingno. with the Pokémon game or brand in any way other than simply being a glitched entity, you're 100% completely fine to use it. Missingno. appeared as a cameo in the 2nd Halloween special of We Bare Bears with no complaints or issues.)

If the first case is likely, then Kermit would be Public domain by now, but because this hasn't been proven, Kermit definitively enters PD in 2061.

* The Noid (Dominos pizza's imp/gremlin-rabbit mascot used to promote their system for free-pizza replacement on accidents. It's debated that because the debut commercial was released without copyright notices and not registered, he's public domain. However, it's very possible notices were provided on printed film for broadcasters out of public view. Because of this in mind, the Noid at maximum enters the PD in 2082.)

Like the Noid, its disputed that his debut appearances had no copyright notices and are PD, but the notices were possibly given to film provided for broadcasters.

* Droopy, Wolfie, and Red (Three well noteworthy Tex Avery characters created for MGM studios. Droopy is looney tunes' melancholic talking hound, while Wolfie and Red are adulterated reimaginings of the Big bad Wolf and Red riding Hood. Droopy and Wolfie first appeared in the short ""Dumb-Hounded"" while Red first appeared in ""Red-Hot Riding Hood"" (well-known thanks to meme culture virally spreading Wolfie's exaggerated cartoonish catcalling of Red), both released in the same year of 1943.

I work for a hotel and months ago they hired this mid 50s attractive man as the head of our department. Tall, fit, full of tattoos, botox and dressing up like he is 25. We got along and he kept bantering with me. Saying flirty things, then acting jealous when x or y guest or coworker hit on me. I thought he was really interested. But things changed after an incident that his team caused at my workspace and he ended up blaming me to conceal his responsibility at HR and I got a write-up. I was hurt. Me and him stopped interacting and now he comes in after I finish my shift. 

We have a manager who is 23. They are close too. I thought it was professionally at first since they work together. Saw her touching him to stick a henna tattoo on him. Twice, he put her on speaker while i was doing paperwork in the office; Asking him if he wanted her to bring her lunch. Another time was because he said he was calling her last night to ask her if she wants him to bring coffee. We had an employee meeting and she would put her hand on his shoulder and they even made a pregnancy joke together. At this point i realized there is no way they are not fucking.

I also saw notes left by another employee on his desk, woth hearts and stuff. 

He opened up to me before, acting as if my life and his are similar and he was probably trying to manipulate me. He is probably going through a midlife crisis and has been a fuckboy. No wonder why he has changed so many workplaces. ",1,1742619138.0,Aging,4,0.57,False

Chapter 1
I loved Lothario De Luca. Desperately. Foolishly. Enough to give him my everything—my heart, my loyalty, my soul.  
And he threw me away like I was nothing.  
""She's my newly hired maid.""
A maid? I'm his maid. That’s how he sees me after six years of being in a relationship with him.
That was what he told me before walking into Alessia Ricci’s arms. She was everything I wasn’t—beautiful, sophisticated, untouchable. But most importantly, she was the supposed daughter of Alexander Anderson, the richest man in Europe. Marrying her would elevate him to a throne of unimaginable power.  
So he chose her. Over me. Over us.  
And for what? A lie.  
Because Alessia isn’t Alexander Anderson’s daughter.  
I AM.
I am Pearl Anderson, heiress to an empire he could never dream of touching. And while he was busy betraying me, I was rising from the ashes. I became a force powerful enough to crush him and his little fiancée with a single whisper.  
Now, it’s my turn to choose.  
And I choose revenge.  
When I walk into that gala, dressed in power, draped in wealth, Lothario turns pale. His lips part. His world tilts.
""Pearl?"" His voice is strained, disbelieving.  
I tilted my head, amused. ""Miss me?""
--
On the night of Lothario’s birthday, I had everything planned. I made reservations at his favorite restaurant, arranged for a private rooftop dinner, and picked out a gift I knew he’d love. Tonight, I would finally tell him my secret—I was pregnant. 
It wasn’t planned, but when I saw the two pink lines, I didn’t feel fear. I felt joy. Hope. Excitement.  
Lothario was always late, but this time, he promised. Yet as the hours ticked by—eight, nine, ten—I sat alone in my apartment, staring at my phone. No missed calls. No messages. Just silence. I exhaled sharply, forcing myself to stay calm. He must be busy. Maybe something came up at work.  
To distract myself, I scrolled through my phone, mindlessly checking the news. That’s when I saw it.  
Alessia Ricci Returns to Italy—World-Famous Supermodel Spotted at Milan Airport!  
My fingers tightened around my phone. Alessia Ricci. Lothario’s first love. The woman he once swore he couldn’t live without. A cold knot formed in my stomach as I clicked on the article. She had been overseas for years, making a name for herself in the fashion industry. Reporters had been buzzing about her return, speculating if she was back for good.  
My heart pounded. It was just a coincidence. That’s all. I told myself there was no reason to worry, but my hands moved on their own, typing her name into Instagram. Her profile popped up immediately—millions of followers, perfectly curated pictures.  
And then I saw it.  
Her latest post. A photo of a candlelit dinner at a five-star restaurant, wine glasses clinking, soft golden lights reflecting off the table. And across from her—Lothario.  
The caption made my breath catch.  
“Some things never change. Good food. Good wine. Even better company. My man.❤️”  
The comments were flooded with excitement.  
“Omg, are you and Lothario back together?”  
“Y’all were my favorite couple! This is EVERYTHING.”  
“Rekindling an old flame? 🔥👀”  
My hands trembled as I swiped through her Instagram stories. Another clip—Lothario pulling out a chair for her, his smile warm. The same smile he used to give me. A final picture. Her hand resting lightly on his, their fingers brushing.  
I felt like I was going to be sick. No. This had to be a misunderstanding. He wouldn’t do this to me. Not tonight. Not when I had something so important to tell him. 
I dialed Lothario. No answer. I called again. Voicemail. Tears blurred my vision. I bit my lip hard, forcing myself to breathe. Maybe it was just a coincidence. Maybe—
I shook my head. Who was I kidding?
I knew exactly where they were. That restaurant—it used to be Lothario and Alessia’s place. It had been their favorite long before I came into his life. Before I could think, I grabbed my coat and keys. I needed to see him. I needed to know if this was real.  
The roads were slick from the light drizzle earlier, streetlights casting a golden glow on the pavement. My hands rested on my stomach as I whispered, “We’ll find out together, okay?”  
Then—  Bright headlights. A deafening horn. Impact. Metal screeched, glass shattered, my body jolted forward as everything spun into chaos.
A ten-wheeler. Brakes failing. Cars crashing into each other like dominoes. And mine—caught in the middle of it.
Pain exploded through me. My world tilted, and darkness swallowed me whole.  
When I woke up, the first thing I noticed was the smell of antiseptic. The second was the sharp, rhythmic beeping of a machine. Hospital. My body felt heavy, my limbs weak. Something tugged at my arm—a drip, IV fluids slowly dripping into my veins.  
I blinked against the harsh fluorescent lights, my vision swimming before settling on the doctor standing beside me. His face was unreadable. Cold dread curled in my stomach.  
“Ms. Rivera…” His voice was gentle, but there was no warmth in it. “I’m sorry. We couldn’t save the baby.”  
For a moment, I couldn’t process the words. Couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. I reached for my stomach with trembling hands. Flat. Empty.  
No. No. No.  
The world blurred as a sharp, shattering pain cleaved through my chest. My baby. My child. Gone.  
Tears burned down my cheeks, and my body shaking with the weight of my grief. Still, I waited. Waited for Lothario. 
Minutes. Hours. The nurse came and went, checking my vitals, offering comforting words that meant nothing.  
Lothario never came.  
With shaking fingers, I reached for my phone. My heart pounded as I dialed his number. It rang. Once. Twice.  
Then, someone answered.  
But it wasn’t Lothario.  
A woman’s voice, smooth and familiar. Alessia.
“Lothario’s busy right now.”  
My stomach twisted into a cold knot. “Who… who is this?” I whispered, even though I already knew. I just needed to hear it.
A soft chuckle. “Alessia Ricci.” A pause. Then, she delivered the final blow. “His fiancée.”  
Fiancée? 
Then what am I to Lothario?
The call ended before I could even speak.  My fingers went numb, and my phone slipped from my grasp. I stared at the ceiling. It was a joke. A mistake. It had to be…
But deep down, I already knew. Lothario had betrayed me.  

Chapter 2
The days blurred together in a haze of grief, pain, and emptiness. I barely ate. I barely slept. The hospital walls felt suffocating, pressing in on me with every passing second.  
But the worst part? The silence. No messages. No calls. Lothario never came.  
I should have known better, but a small part of me still clung to hope. Maybe he didn’t know. Maybe he hadn’t heard about the accident. Maybe, just maybe, there was a reason for all of this.  
So the moment I found the strength to stand, I forced myself out of bed, ignoring the soreness in my limbs and the bandages wrapped around my body. I had to see him. I needed answers.  
But as I reached for my coat, memories flooded in—memories of the Lothario I once knew.  
I remembered the time I got lost in the forest. It was supposed to be a simple hike, but the sun had set too quickly, and before I knew it, I was alone, freezing, and bleeding from a cut on my leg. Lothario had found me. I could still hear his voice, thick with worry.  
“Pearl! Where are you?”  
The moment I saw him running toward me, I burst into tears. He dropped to his knees, checking my injury with shaking hands. “Come on, Pearl. Why would you go alone? What if I didn’t find you in time?”  
I tried to laugh it off. “You always find me, Lothario.”  
He scoffed, lifting me into his arms. “That’s not the point. You scared me.”  
He didn’t leave my side that night, sitting beside my hospital bed, fingers intertwined with mine. “I’m never letting you go off on your own again, understood?” he'd whispered, pressing a soft kiss to my forehead.  
I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to shake off the ache in my chest. Where was that Lothario now?  
Then, another memory surfaced—the winter we went ice skating. It had started as a perfect day, with snowflakes dancing in the air as we skated hand in hand. But I’d been careless, too excited, and ended up twisting my ankle. I remembered the way Lothario had caught me just before I hit the ice, his arms strong around me.  
“Are you okay? Does it hurt?” he had asked, his face etched with concern.  
I had tried to play it off, but the pain was too much. Without hesitation, he had carried me off the rink, his jaw clenched in frustration. “You’re so stubborn. Why didn’t you let me teach you properly?”  
“Because I wanted to be good at it already.""
He had sighed, gently massaging my ankle before carrying me to the hospital. And after? He showed up at my apartment with my favorite food, a bouquet of roses, and the biggest teddy bear he could find.  
“Since you can’t walk for a while, you’ll have to hug this instead of me,” he'd joked, ruffling my hair.  
That was Lothario. That was the man I loved.  
And yet, now? Nothing. No Lothario. No calls. No messages. No flowers. No teddy bear. Not even a simple 'Are you okay?'
I clenched my fists, swallowing back the tears that threatened to spill. Maybe I had been a fool to believe I still meant something to him.  
But I needed to hear it from him. I needed to see the truth for myself.  
So, with shaking legs and a heart that felt too heavy to carry, I walked out of the hospital.
...
Lothario’s estate was the same as always. Grand, untouchable. But something was different this time. The guards at the gate hesitated before letting me in. The maids inside lowered their gazes when they saw me. A thick silence hung in the air, as if the entire house was holding its breath.  
This was the third time I had been here. Unlike before, when we lived together in a small apartment, this mansion was newly bought by Lothario after he became a millionaire. When he asked to live alone, I agreed without question—I didn’t want to ruin our relationship. Space was supposed to be good for us.  
But now, standing in the middle of his grand estate, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was nothing more than a guest in his life.
And then I saw them. The invitations. Neatly stacked on the marble foyer table.  
Lothario De Luca & Alessia Ricci.  
Engagement Party – This Friday.  
My vision blurred. The walls of my stomach twisted painfully, and before I could stop myself, I stumbled into the nearest sink and threw up. He was mine. Wasn’t he?  
A soft, familiar voice cut through the fog in my mind.  
“Pearl?”  
I wiped my mouth, my entire body trembling as I turned. Lothario stood there, tall and perfect as ever. As if nothing had happened. His eyes ran over me, but he didn’t frown at the bruises on my skin, didn’t notice the bandages peeking out from beneath my sleeves. He just smiled.  
“I’ve been meaning to call you,” he said casually, stepping closer. “I got busy.”  
I swallowed the bitterness on my mouth. He reached out, pulling me into a warm embrace. The scent of his expensive cologne wrapped around me, familiar yet sickening. My body stiffened, but I let him hold me. No need to lash out. Not yet.  
“Come,” he murmured, pulling away. “Have dinner with me.”  
I followed him into the dining hall, my heart pounding in my chest. The long table was already set. Crystal glasses, silver cutlery, steaming plates of perfectly arranged food. He poured me a glass of wine like nothing had changed. Like we weren’t broken.  
I forced myself to stay calm, to play along, even as my hands trembled around the glass. I watched him, waiting. Finally, as he twirled his fork into his pasta, I spoke.  
“What am I to you, Lothario?”  
He didn’t even hesitate. “The woman I’m going to marry.”  
I felt my stomach drop.  
“The woman I want to have a child with,” he added. 
The words struck like a blade. A child.  
I bit my lip hard enough to taste blood. He didn’t know. He didn’t know I had been in an accident. He didn’t know I had been carrying his child. He didn’t know that I had lost everything.  
And worst of all—he didn’t care enough to ask.
Chapter 3
I stared at him, my heart pounding in my chest. Should I test him? Should I see if I still meant something—if there was even a small part of him that would choose me over Alessia?  
The words left my lips before I could stop them.  
“Lothario… I’m pregnant.”  
Silence. I held my breath, waiting for his reaction. Waiting for him to say something—anything.  
But he just sat there, twirling his fork, focused on his food like I hadn’t just dropped a bomb on him. No excitement. No anger. No concern. Just silence.  
The lump in my throat grew heavier. My hands shook as I reached for my wine glass, but in my panic, I choked. I coughed violently, struggling for air, my vision blurring with unshed tears.  
Still, nothing from him. That silence… that was my answer.  
Before I could even process the pain cutting through me, the dining hall doors swung open.  
“Babe,” a soft, melodic voice called.  
Alessia.  
I barely had time to compose myself before she walked in, looking effortlessly beautiful in a sleek red dress, her heels clicking against the floor.  
Lothario immediately stood up and went to her, his entire demeanor changing. His face softened, his eyes warm and full of something I hadn’t seen in a long time.  
Then, right in front of me, he cupped her face and kissed her.  
My heart stopped. The sound of their lips meeting felt louder than the ringing in my ears. My whole body went numb, my hands gripping the edge of the table to steady myself.  
They kissed. Right there. Like I didn’t exist at all. Like I was nothing.  
And then they started talking—about their engagement party, about the guest list, about how perfect everything had to be.  
I just stood there, frozen. Tears slipped down my cheeks, but I couldn’t even move to wipe them away. I wasn’t sure if it was from heartbreak or humiliation.  
Then, as if finally noticing me, Alessia turned to Lothario, her brows furrowing in confusion.  
“Who is she?” she asked. “Why is she crying like that? Why is she even here?”  
Lothario let out a sigh, like this was just some inconvenience he had to deal with.
“She's my newly hired maid. I'll deal with her.” 
A maid? Me? My lips tremble. Then he walked over to me, grabbed my wrist with force, and pulled me toward the door. 
“I’ll call you later tonight,” he muttered, his voice low. Then he wiped a tear from my cheek, as if that would somehow erase everything.  
Before I could say a word, he shut the door in my face.  
A loud sound.  
And just like that… I was locked out. Thrown away. Like I had never mattered at all.
I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream.  
Instead, I walked away that night with my head held high. But I wasn’t done yet. If they wanted a grand celebration, I’d give them a night they’d never forget.  

*** 
The night of the engagement party, I slipped into a sleek black dress. The kind that clung to my curves, elegant but bold. A dress that demanded attention.  
My makeup was flawless, my lips painted the deepest shade of red. If I was going to crash this party, I was going to look like I belonged there.  
I arrived at the venue without an invitation, but I didn’t need one. The moment I stepped into the grand ballroom, heads turned. Murmurs followed.  
But I didn’t care about them.  
My eyes found him immediately.  
Lothario De Luca.  
My Lothario.  
No—not mine. Not anymore.  
He stood tall, his arm wrapped around her. Alessia. The woman he had always been waiting for. The woman he had chosen.  
They looked perfect together. Like a couple out of a fairy tale.  And I?  
I was the tragedy they had left behind.  
But not tonight. Tonight, I would remind Lothario exactly what he threw away.  
The moment I stepped into the ballroom, silence spread like wildfire. Surprised sounds rippled through the crowd, whispers trailing behind me.  
I felt their eyes. Their judgment. But I didn’t stop.  I walked straight toward him.  
Lothario’s entire body stiffened when he saw me. His blue eyes locked onto mine, widening slightly before narrowing into something sharp—something cold.  
“Pearl?” His voice was laced with disbelief. With warning.  
I tilted my head, smiling sweetly. “Surprised to see me?”  
Alessia turned, her perfectly curled hair bouncing as she looked me up and down. Then, she let out a dramatic burst.  
“Oh! You’re—” She snapped her fingers, pretending to remember. “You’re the maid, right? Lothario’s personal housekeeper?”  
The room erupted into soft chuckles.  
Maid? My chest tightened, but I refused to break.  
I lifted my chin. “That’s cute, Alessia. But if I were just a maid, your fiancé wouldn’t have spent six years in my bed.”  
Her smile faltered. The guests whispered louder now, shifting uncomfortably.  
Lothario’s jaw clenched, his fingers twitching at his sides. “Leave, Pearl.”  
I ignored him. Instead, I reached into my clutch and pulled out the truth.  
One by one, I threw the papers at him.  
A pregnancy test. Ultrasound images. Hospital records.  The final one hit his chest and fluttered to the floor—the miscarriage report.  
Murmurs filled the ballroom. Someone dropped their champagne glass.  
Lothario’s face paled, his eyes flickering to the documents at his feet. His lips parted, but he said nothing. Nothing. He didn’t even try to deny it. But Alessia did.  
She let out an exaggerated laugh, crossing her arms. “This is pathetic. Truly.” She glanced at the documents before rolling her eyes. “What are you even trying to prove? That you had some fake pregnancy to trap Lothario? How desperate.”  
My nails dug into my palm. “I lost my child because of you,” I whispered. “Because of both of you!""  
Alessia scoffed. “Oh, please. Lothario wouldn’t be dumb enough to get someone like you pregnant.”  
Someone like me.  
Lothario finally moved then.  
But not toward me. He turned slightly—toward Alessia.  
I saw the hesitation in his eyes. The flicker of something unreadable. But it lasted only a second before his expression hardened.  
Then, in a voice so cold it cut through me, he said:  
“She’s lying.”  
I froze. The air around me seemed to vanish.  
Lothario’s gaze met mine, but there was nothing there. No guilt. No regret. No warmth.  
Just denial.  
“She’s a nobody,” Lothario continued, his tone emotionless. “Just a bitter ex who can’t accept reality.”  
The world spun around me.  
“Lothario…” My voice cracked.  
But he wasn’t done.  He turned to the guards standing near the entrance. “Get her out of here.”  
A sharp pain sliced through my chest.  
He—he was throwing me out? Just like that?  
Alessia smirked, stepping closer to him. “Oh, and make sure she doesn’t come near us again. If she tries, I’ll sue her for defamation. Crashing my engagement and throwing these ridiculous allegations? It’s laughable.”  
Laughter echoed around the room. Mocking. Cruel.  Tears burned the back of my eyes, but I refused to let them fall.  
I refused to break.  Instead, I reached for the nearest table and grabbed a knife.  

Chapter 4
Murmurs erupted again.  
Lothario finally reacted, his eyes widening slightly. “Pearl—”  
I didn’t stab anyone. I didn’t cause a scene.  
Instead, I dragged the blade across my palm, hissing as sharp pain cut through my skin. Then, with slow, deliberate movements, I smeared my blood across the white tablecloth.  
A stark red stain. A final mark. The last thing I would ever give him.  
“This is my last gift to you,” I whispered. My voice was calm. Steady. Dead.  
Then, I turned my back on him. And this time, when I walked away—  I never looked back.
I stormed into my apartment, my hands shaking with rage. The moment the door slammed shut behind me, I moved.  
I tore through my closet, grabbed every single one of his shirts, his jackets, the ties I carefully picked out for him when he was still mine. I yanked open the drawers, shoving everything Lothario left behind into a black trash bag—his cologne, his expensive watches, even the old, worn-out hoodie he used to let me wear when I got cold.  
I loved that hoodie once. Now, it made me sick.  
His expensive suits? In the bin. The stupid love letters he once wrote? Burned.  
I dragged the bag outside, dumped it into the trash bin, and without hesitation—I set it on fire. Flames roared to life, swallowing every trace of him.  
Good. Let them burn!
I stood there, watching the fire, feeling the heat on my skin—wishing it could burn away everything he put me through.  Then, I pulled out my phone. The one number I swore I would never call again.  
My father.  Mr. Alexander Anderson. The most influential and richest man in the Europe.
The phone barely rang twice before a deep, familiar voice filled my ear.  
""Pearl?""  
Just that. Just my name. And suddenly, I couldn’t breathe.  
I squeezed my eyes shut. My throat tightened. I had spent years proving that I didn’t need him. That I could survive without his money, his influence—his name.  
I disowned myself just to show him I could make it on my own. And I did.  
But right now, at this moment… I had nothing.  
I broke down. I sobbed so hard I could barely get the words out.  
""Dad… can I come home?""  
There was a pause. A deep breath. And then—  
""Of course, sweetheart. You never had to ask.""  
My knees buckled. Relief flooded my chest so intensely it hurt.  For the first time in years, I allowed myself to be his daughter again.  
As I packed the rest of my things, the memories hit me like a tidal wave.  
Memories of him.  
Of Lothario De Luca  
The man I fell for long before he even knew my name.  

***
I had been working part-time at a small coffee shop back then, juggling shifts to pay for my rent and college fees.  
And every morning—like clockwork—he walked in. He always ordered the same thing. Black coffee, no sugar.  
At first, he was just another customer. But then, I started noticing him. The way he ran his hands through his hair when he was stressed. The way his brows furrowed when he stared at his laptop screen. How his lips curved into a soft smile whenever I handed him his cup.  
He was beautiful. A quiet mystery that I couldn’t stop watching.  
And then, one day… he spoke to me.  
""You always look so tired,"" he had said, tilting his head. ""Do you even sleep?""  
I laughed. ""I try.""  
""Try harder,"" he said, sliding an extra tip across the counter. ""And maybe eat something too.""  
My stupid heart fluttered. I had a massive crush on him.  
But that was all he was back then—a distant fantasy. A man I admired from afar.  
Until the night I saw him fall apart.  
I still remember it. The way he sat slumped on a park bench in the pouring rain, clutching a rejection letter. His hands trembled. His eyes were hollow.  And for the first time, he looked… human. Broken. Defeated.  I didn’t know what came over me, but I sat beside him, holding out my umbrella.  
""You again?"" he muttered, looking at me with tired eyes.  
I shrugged. ""You looked like you needed company."" 
That night, he told me everything. How he had nothing left. How Alessia had just left him for her career. How he was drowning in debts and failures.  
""Then let’s start with nothing."" I whispered. ""Together.""  
And just like that, we became us.  
I worked double shifts—day and night—just to support him. I paid for our rent. Our food. Even the small investments that would eventually build his empire. He worked as a waiter, but it wasn’t enough. So I pushed myself harder. I barely slept. I barely lived. But I never gave up on him.  
And when his business finally took off—when he became the Lothario De Lothario the world admired—he had held my hands and whispered,  
""I will never love anyone but you. You are my everything, Pearl.""  
Lies. All of it.  
I gave him everything. And when he finally reached the top, he handed it all to her.  
I was still shaking when my phone rang again.  
Lothario. I stared at the screen, my heart pounding. Then, I answered.  
Before I could speak, his furious voice crashed through the speaker.  
""What the heck were you thinking?"" he growled. ""Crashing my engagement? Making a scene? Have you lost your mind?!""  
I let out a bitter laugh. “You lost that privilege the moment you betrayed me.”  
""You need to learn your lesson, Pearl,"" he snapped. ""I need Alessia for my company. Her father is Mr. Alexander Anderson! The Europe most richest man. Alessia is the lost heiress. You should’ve respected my decision and played your role!""  
I almost laughed. Alexander Anderson. ""My role?"" I repeated.
""Yes!"" His voice dropped lower, almost desperate. ""You should’ve just waited for me. Stayed quiet. You should've understood that I need her for my business, but it's you whom I love!""  
I felt sick. He expected me to sit in the shadows like some mistress while he paraded her as his wife?  
No. Never.  
I exhaled sharply. “Get lost, Lothario.” Then, I hung up and blocked his number.  
By midnight, I was at the airport. As I boarded the plane, I looked out at the city one last time.  
The place where I built my dreams. Where I built us. Where I lost everything.  
I took a deep breath. And then, I let it all go.  
Goodbye, Lothario. Goodbye, my past.  
I was going home. But this wasn’t the end.
I would rise again—stronger, smarter. And when I did, Lothario would regret ever betraying me.
Because this time, I wouldn’t just walk away.
I would destroy him.",1,1742618859.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

He sometimes sends me pics of him in bathing suits or just selfies in general, not in a thirsty way or even ""inappropriate"" necessarily, just we'll be talking about our days, and then he'll send a pic of him at the beach, that sort of thing.

 He has on several occasions said something to  the effect of ""I'd totally date you if you were gay"" and asked if I'd ever considered dating guys. These comments were months apart and among many hours of innocuous conversation. It's also important to mention that he's autistic and doesn't always think before he speaks, so it's more harmless than it might seem. Recently, he started calling our hangouts ""dates"", like ""coffee date, lunch date"" etc, He has made a few recent comments that were also on the edge a little, joking about how if the guy he was flirting with knew he was having dinner with ""another guy"" (me) he might get jealous which seems like a weird thing to say to a platonic friend. 

 He also seems to hope for on ongoing, daily text conversation and just generally has a different communication style than me. He's one of those people who is a bit intense over the phone, sends multiple messages back to every text, and usually within seconds/minutes of receiving the text, but is pretty chill in person. 

I've worked with and been friends with other people on the spectrum, and I know that clear, consistent boundaries are really important, but I also don't want to be an asshole and have boundaries where none are needed. 

I might not be giving a convincing enough account to justify my title, but we've been friends since high school (he was held back once and I was a summer birthday), so I know him really well at this point.

My father passed away due to liver cirrhosis/ cancer at 64 and I want to make sure I am taking the right steps to live longer and spend time with my family. I am 40, active, about 198 pounds, 5’ 10”, and 20% body fat. I don’t smoke, drink, use hard drugs. What can be causing this sudden spike? My eating is not the best, I consume about 50g sugar a day from coffee and other snacks / sources.  As you can see there is a drastic change in the last 12 months. I was also working out the day prior to the test. Would like to know your thoughts.

## Understanding the Different types of indoor Fire Pits

The indoor fire pit market offers a variety of options, each with its own unique characteristics and fuel source. Understanding the differences between these types is crucial to making an informed decision.

### 1. Indoor Ethanol Fireplace

Ethanol fire pits are arguably the most popular type due to their clean-burning nature and ease of use. These fire pits use bioethanol fuel, a renewable alcohol-based fuel that produces real flames without smoke, soot, or ash.

### 2. Indoor Gel Fireplace

**Pros:**

*   Easy to use: simply place the gel canister in the fire pit and light it.

* Larger flame than other types.

**Cons:**
* Propane is a dangerous fuel and requires expert install.
* Requires tanks.
* Potentially high cost.

## Safety First: Significant Considerations for Indoor Fire Pits

while indoor fire pits offer a convenient and stylish way to enjoy the warmth of a fire, it's crucial to prioritize safety. Here are some essential safety precautions:

*   **Ventilation:** Even though most indoor fire pits are ventless, it's still essential to ensure proper ventilation in the room. Open a window or door to allow fresh air to circulate.
*   **Fuel Storage:** Store fuel in a cool, dry place away from heat and open flames. Keep fuel out of reach of children and pets.
*   **Placement:** Place the fire pit on a stable,heat-resistant surface away from flammable materials such as curtains,furniture,and paper.
*   **Supervision:** never leave a burning fire pit unattended.
*   **Fire extinguisher:** Keep a fire extinguisher nearby in case of an emergency.
*   **Carbon Monoxide Detector:** Even though ethanol and gel fire pits produce minimal carbon monoxide, it's still an excellent idea to have a carbon monoxide detector in your home.
*   **Read the Instructions:** Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.* Avoid placing objects directly on any ""indoor fire pit with screen"" or other protective barrier to avoid overheating.
* Consider buying a ""safe indoor fire pit."" Look for certifications to confirm safe usage.

For apartment dwellers, it is important to always check with the landlord that an indoor fire pit is allowed within the lease. Failure to do so can create issues that can otherwise be avoided. Also, it's always an excellent idea to ensure that you have renter's insurance to deal with unforseen disasters.

[Casabrews CM5418/Baratza 485 grinder],"I recently purchased the above espresso machine and grinder, moving from a Lavazza Blue pod machine (with which I was very happy, but got tired of generating so much pod waste.) The Blue made consistently good espresso with decent creama.

The Casabrews machine is more hit and miss. I’m using Lavazza espresso beans and my grinder said to use a setting of 8. I use the same beans, the same grind, the same water, the same amount of coffee, and the pressure is always right where it should be at midline, yet my espresso varies from just good to thin and watery. I cannot figure out the variable. I’ve begun manually controlling the water volume and making super short shots. It tastes much better, but it feels like I’m using a lot of coffee to get a very little bit of espresso.
I guess I’m making ristretto shots now.

Aside from the variability of the espresso, the big problem I cannot solve is, of every pull, 2/3 of the cup is foam. Not crema, but foam. I’ve read that excess foam is a byproduct of the pressure forcing the coffee and water through the small hole in the double walled basket. My question is, is there any way to stop the foam.

And my next question, is if I’m dissatisfied enough with this machine and want to upgrade, is there a better compact machine (I have very limited space) I should consider and won’t break the bank.",1,1742617531.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

She was one of those people—a force so gentle, yet so powerful, she left an imprint on my soul that I will carry for the rest of my life.

She never demanded attention. She didn’t chase the spotlight or seek validation. She moved through the world with quiet grace, unnoticed by many, but unforgettable to those who truly saw her.

People misjudged her often. They mistook her silence for arrogance, her distance for indifference. But they were wrong. She wasn’t cold—she was cautious. She wasn’t unfeeling—she was protecting herself. Life had taught her that not everyone who smiles is a friend, so she built walls, wore her armor, and kept most people at arm’s length. But if you were lucky enough to slip past those defenses, you would see the truth—she was all heart.

She cared more than she let on. She felt deeply, even when she pretended not to. She carried burdens that weren’t hers to carry, shouldering the pain of others because she didn’t know how to let go. She always tried to do the right thing, even when it cost her something. Even when it hurt.

I remember the way she would drop everything to be there for someone she loved. It didn’t matter if she was exhausted, if she had her own problems—if you needed her, she showed up. Again and again. She never asked for anything in return. It was just who she was.

She was selfless in ways most people aren’t. When she learned about injustice, she didn’t just talk about it—she acted. I still remember how much she loved Starbucks, how it was part of her daily life, her little escape in a cup. But when she found out about the suffering in Gaza, she stopped drinking it. Just like that. No hesitation, no complaints. Because for her, doing the right thing mattered more than her own comfort.

And yet, for all her strength, she doubted herself constantly. She was afraid of making mistakes, afraid of disappointing people. She second-guessed her own worth, never realizing how extraordinary she truly was. But I saw it. I saw the way she carried herself with quiet dignity, the way she held onto her beliefs even when it was difficult. I saw the way she loved—fiercely, protectively.

She was human, but sometimes, she felt like more than that. She was proof that kindness still exists.

Of course, she wasn’t perfect. She had her quirks, little flaws that only made her more endearing. She was addicted to coffee in a way that was almost comical. No matter how many cups she had, it was never enough. I used to joke that one day she’d end up replacing her blood with caffeine. She would just roll her eyes, take another sip, and call me an idiot.

She was a foodie at heart, always excited about trying something new. It didn’t matter how small or simple the meal was—if it was good, she would light up. And seeing her happy, even over something as small as a bite of dessert, was one of those moments I wish I had cherished more.

She had this way of making the ordinary feel special. A simple text, an inside joke, the way she noticed the little things—somehow, when she was there, it all felt significant.

She was also fiery—oh, she could be terrifying when she wanted to be. Small but fierce, like a storm packed into a tiny frame. She didn’t tolerate nonsense, and she didn’t let people walk over her. I lost count of the number of times she threatened to end my life over the dumbest things. And yet, beneath that fire, there was a softness too. A warmth that made you feel safe.

And I—

I was a fool.

I didn’t realize how much she meant to me until it was too late. I didn’t realize that she had become part of my world, that seeing her, talking to her, even just knowing she was there—it had become my anchor. And when that anchor was gone, I drifted. I didn’t know how to exist in a world where she wasn’t in it.

I wish I had been better. I wish I had done things differently. I wish I had been someone worthy of standing beside her. But some wishes never come true.

I think about her more often than I’d like to admit. I wonder if she ever thinks of me, if my name ever lingers on her mind the way hers still echoes in mine. Maybe to her, I am nothing more than a shadow she has long since left behind. But to me, she is a light that never dims.

If I could speak to her now, if I could gather all the words I never said, I would tell her this:

You were the best thing I never knew how to hold.
The quiet kind of beautiful—the kind you don’t realize you need until it’s gone.

And if I lost you to my own mistakes,
then let me bear that truth.
Let me carry the silence,
the absence,
the empty spaces where your laughter used to be.

But if you ever find it in you to forgive me—
even if you never say it,
even if time has taken you too far from me—
know this:

I never stopped carrying you with me.
And I never will.

I've been roasting on a Skywalker for about a year, and just got an opportunity to move over to a 1kg Fuji Royal. It doesn't have any Artisan hook up. Just a digital temp display, a gas pressure reader, a 10-click exhaust fan setting, and is entirely analog otherwise.

I did 4 batches this morning completely blind (the guy renting it to me didn't have a scale on hand, whoops) but he said he normally charges at 120C, hits turnaround at 80C, and hits first crack around 150C with a normal total roast time of around 13min. I got a couples roasts down to under 10 this morning with more ""standard"" DE/FC temps/timings, but I have no idea what I'm doing in terms of changing the gas power.

Is there a certain kPa that is typically considered ""max""? Or is it flame height or something? What temps would you normally charge at? What about between batch protocol on these things?

I'm about to do a deep dive down the rabbit hole of gas roasters, but figured I'd cast my net here as well for any advice y'all have. Thanks in advance!",2,1742617136.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

In other words, welcome to the SEC Invitational where, no joke, 14 out of their 16 teams occupy the field. My God, its spreading to beyond Baseball and Football. Anyway, here are your victims for Round One and the First Four

St Francis PA

Nice that St Francis made it back to the tournament after 35 years of waiting (the one in a town in the middle of redneck Pennsylvania, not Brooklyn). The first game of March Madness did not disappoint. St Francis had the lead all game, but a comeback from Alabama State in the 2^(nd) half would lead to a tie. Then what followed was one of the sloppiest finishes in recent memory in the tournament. With milliseconds to spare, Alabama State would put in the game-winning Hail Mary lay-up. This was the first ever March Madness win for this HBCU school. Great performance nonetheless from Saint Francis, as they went in this game with a losing record. Where are they in Pennsylvania again?

San Diego State

UNC is somehow in. A team that only had 1 win against Quad 1 opponents. I call absolute conspiracy. Bubba Cunningham must have slipped MJ’s secret stuff into everyone’s coffees at the negotiating table. UNC is being sent out to slaughter all for Cunningham’s personal gain of at least $104,000. This bullshit has gotten to the point where the West Virginia governor is suing the NCAA because the Mountaineers are the first ones out. Like they give two shits about losing to last-place Colorado in the conference tournament. I felt Indiana was more snubbed because they actually got their shit together at the end of the season. So yeah, UNC is in this tournament, much to the dismay of literally everyone else. “I hope San Diego State fucking destroys them” they said. “They’re frauds with a capital F”. They may be frauds, but they’re still blue bloods. And when there is a sliver of leeway, UNC takes it with authority. To the tune of 61% shooting in the first half. Look on the bright side, Aztecs. At least it wasn’t UConn this time. Lamont Butler sends his regards.

You know what is actually the funniest thing about the situation? Indiana took West Virginia’s head coach! HAHAHAHAHAHA!

American

Pretty damn symbolic that American University, a college in D.C. that is currently in the Patriot League, would lose in the First Four. Make it make sense, America. Matt Rogers deserves better.

Texas

I need a little brush-up on my grammar. According to the internet, Xavier’s X is pronounced silent as its original pronunciation is from the Basque region. That’s kind of why Xavier adopted the Musketeers nickname as well. Well I say these rules have been changed. You get to keep your X, Xavier. Xavier would come back from its largest deficit all season to silence Texas. Oh yeah, Texas also has an X in its name. And because they went quiet in the 2^(nd) half, I’m gonna treat Texas’ name as such (this ONLY applies to UT-Austin). From now on, Texas will be pronounced as “Tejas”, which actually is the correct pronunciation in Spanish.

It really was the end all be all for Tejas. Head coach Rodney Terry has been told to fuck off.

Louisville

Louisville got absolutely screwed by the committee. Louisville was in the Top 10 after the ACC Tournament and yet they slid to an 8^(th) seed. And worse, they have to play at their biggest rival’s arena in Lexington. They faced an equally underrated Creighton squad who absolutely kicked the ever-loving shit out of them. I mean I know Pat Kelsey never had a tournament win so far, but I would’ve expected at least SOME competitiveness from him. Foolish of me to not take into account Creighton’s experience in the tournament. And the fact that Kalkbrenner is still on the team. Disgraceful performance. Unless Louisville does win in the tournament, I will not trust them from here on out. I expected A LOT better from you, Cards.

High Point

Welcome back everyone to the Purdue Invitational! Where we get to see up-and-coming loser programs try to take down the giant. Up first in our 2025 edition is High Point, a team that is making its tournament debut. High Point’s athletics department went out of its way to buy tickets and travel for more than 200 students. High Point lived up to the hype most of the game. It is kind of “return-to-form” for Purdue that they play down to their level. With Zach Edey gone, much of their defensive leverage is gone. But alas, the wish we grant sometimes cannot be fulfilled. Purdue holds on in the 2^(nd) half to avoid humiliation for one more year. Thanks for playing, High Point. It allowed us in the short time you’re here to ignore the fact that your city makes furniture for a living.

Montana

Wisconsin was another team that had trouble in the first half but made their getaway in the 2^(nd) half. They leave Montana in the wilderness of a first-round exit.

Southern Illinois-Edwardsville

SIUE would make their tournament debut. Their head coach Brian Broome made it possible by storing a special pair of scissors until they cut the nets when they would win the Ohio Valley Tournament. The 7-year wait would be over. If they got another pair of scissors for beating a first-round opponent, sorry to say for SIUE that that encasing might never be opened. Not with opponents like Houston whipping your asses.

Alabama State

50 miles separate Auburn and Alabama State. The same could be said for the pregame spread for this game. At least they didn’t lose by that much. Positive?

Clemson

Sometimes the way teams compete in March Madness is unexplanatory. Nothing more could be said about Clemson. How the FUCK that this team, who went 18-2 in the ACC and made it to the Elite 8 last year, would score only 13 points in the first half?! TO MCNEESE STATE?! McNeese last year was the only team I picked for an upset in the first round. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, I get an appointment to get my eyes gouged. The tragic thing was Clemson did show up in the 2^(nd) half. But their shortcomings were too far to overcome in the end. Clemson and Louisville, the two ACC teams that everyone likes, are both gone. And just like that, millions of brackets are scrapped in unison.

And NOW they’re saying that Will Wade is dipping McNeese to become the next head coach for NC State after the tournament! Clemson fans, welcome to hell.

VCU

Almost forgot that the Atlantic 10 existed. BYU knew the score immediately. Former Utah State coach Ryan Odom coaching your opponents? Murder them on live television. Fitting way to get BYU’s first tournament win in a decade.

Georgia

Shocking. An SEC team with a losing record in conference turns out to be a massive fraud despite their relative seeding. This was a 1^(st) round KO in the bluntest of ways. A 15-0 start from Gonzaga is a deficit few could recover from. Especially against the almighty Zags. Bulldogs beat Bulldawgs. And Bulldawgs beat themselves \*speeding tickets\*.

Wofford

Congrats Wofford! You’re the last team from South Carolina still in the bracket after Clemson’s agonizing upset. Your reward is getting torched by 2^(nd) seeded Tennessee. Moving on.

Kansas

From the moment this was announced, I knew this was the game to watch for the first round: Kansas vs Calipari’s Arkansas. Calipari teams have a habit of choking recently. But Kansas is living it right now. The Jayhawks were #1 preseason and yet they are a 7 seed. The game lived up to the billing with a close game throughout. But Kansas potential was lost once it coughed up 4 turnovers and 7 points in a 1:30 span. All props got to Jonas Aidoo and Johnell Davis for pulling off the upset. Arkansas beats Kansas in the tournament for the 2^(nd) time in 3 years. This also breaks a 20-year streak for Kansas. This is the first loss in the First Round for the Jayhawks since 2006. Our first blue blood is gone.

Yale

And another blue blood is gone in different terms. Yale last year shocked the world with an upset over Auburn. With Yale getting most of their guys back with a certain John Poulakidas, Yale was prepped to go after another SEC foe. Yale hung through until late in the game, but Texas A&M was too much for them. Let’s hope Yale doesn’t get its federal funding pulled, because, to be honest, the reason that the government had for UPenn to pull its funding is trivial. Ill leave it at that. Back to your studying, nerds.

Missouri

I think its easy to hate all the Drake’s in the world. Last year’s tournament, Drake denied Cream Abdul-Jabbar’s moment to shine. Also last year, another Drake just happened to get exposed in front of the whole damn music industry. But as time goes on, we all forget what made us angry at them and just accept their omnipresence. Drake just defeated a mid-SEC team in the first round. Once again, shocker.

Utah State

Utah State is on the right foot with Jerrod Calhoun putting up a 26-win season in his first year. Unfortunately, they had to face the Pacific “brick wall of the hardwood” known as UCLA. Funny. The Big Ten mediocre teams are doing well so far.

Nebraska-Omaha

Hypocritical that I picked Omaha as a longshot upset bid. But St Johns I believe is the weakest 2^(nd) seed. St Johns does do a lot of playing down to competition, but they make up for it with shutdown defensive tactics in the 2^(nd) half and three-point shooting. Omaha might have had AEW wrestlers and Jon Gruden on their side and an early lead to boot, but Pitino has been there done that. It took a long while to get going, but St Johns would win their first March Madness game in 25 years. Ohama, you’re no longer elbow-dropping trash cans; you are the trash cans. Respectfully, of course.

UC San Diego

I just keep missing on the March Madness Whack-a-Mole, do I? UC San Diego was a favorable “upset” pick over Michigan. UC San Diego went 30-4 and Big West champs. The only problem was strength of schedule, but with a commanding resume its hard to ignore them. Michigan would take control the whole game but trouble was brewing. The Tritons would take full advantage of Michigan’s turnover struggles and even managed to take the lead late. But the Triton quest of a maiden win comes to an end due to Michigan’s high-end talent saving their asses in the closing minutes. Valient game by the Tritons. They could be back, but I doubt they’d have a 30-win season again. Don’t scare us like that again, Michigan.

UNC Wilmington

Texas Tech would also have a scare in the closing moments of Day 1. UNCW was right with Texas Tech the whole game due to output from the bench, mostly from Nolan Hodge. The Seahawk’s attack was relentless, but it wasn’t enough to keep up with Texas Tech. Elijah Hawkins would check out the game with a double-double, instrumental in his own right. Sigh of relief for Texas Tech.

Mississippi State

Yet another mid SEC team with no reason to be here has gone to past. I’ll give it this, they managed to hang in till the very end. But Baylor has tournament experience and a certain Jeremy Roach who transferred from Duke. Still a very entertaining game.

Robert Morris

Oh great. Another year where Alabama stupefyingly plays down to a small school for most of the game. Robert Morris almost had it. They were leading at one point in the game. But the hot streak just ended for them. Mark Sears and Grant Nelson were just too much premium talent for the Colonials. Not much on clutch shots, but more on awareness and taking fouls. And there were a lot of questionable fouls down the stretch. Brush that shit up, Bama, cause you’re not getting to the championship with performances like this. Interesting that Nate Oats would withhold Grant Nelson until the end of the game.

Lipscomb

A university that combs lips? Never heard of it. But like what happens after combing, it is immediately ruined when there’s a strong wind. Never had a chance.

Memphis

Looks like the leading mid-major school is out early. Colorado State had tons of momentum riding on one of the longest active winning streaks. The Rams had control all 2^(nd) half. The wait will have to continue for PJ Haggerty to bloom in the tournament. Damn shame if Penny Hardaway would waste this man. The discontinuation of the Penny is gonna happen if it comes to this. At least you all have the Grizzlies.

Mount Saint Mary’s

Opponents cower. Cooper is back. Raise the black Flagg.

Vanderbilt

The other Saint Mary’s faired way better. Oh look what we have here. Yet ANOTHER mid SEC team biting the dust in the first round. Vanderbilt was one of the more likable ones to me. They had been giant killers in SEC play, yet they can’t put away the Gaels. They may have been built near a Wendy’s, but they ain’t fresh.

UNC

At least one of those SEC teams (that doesn’t have any tournament experience) did something. In fact, they did most of America a huge favor of putting out UNC. The Tar Heels now exit the tournament with a Quad 1 record of 1-13. Justice prevails today. This leaves only one ACC team remaining, the least ever for the ACC for the Second Round.

Grand Canyon

GCU came into this tournament with a tough act to follow. They must return to the uncharted territory of the second round. Instead what they got was an absolute pummeling by Maryland. Deep hole, isn’t it Lopes?

Norfolk State

The second of the HBCU’s in this tournament are extinguished. And just like Alabama State, it was to a superior SEC school. More on the entertaining side of blowout, though.

Troy

Troy was another big upset bid and why shouldn’t they? Kentucky had been the most recent running gag of the NCAA tournament. On how they’re not built for March and all that? Well, this is a new Kentucky. And thank fucking God the Wildcats actually did what they were supposed to do. And a healthy blowout. Positive signs for them, indeed.

Marquette

You weren’t fond to just losing to St John’s three times this season, but you end your season losing to New Mexico. Those Lobos have Rick Pitino’s son, Richard, as their head coach. In Godfather terms, you just lost to Michael Corleone’s team. You cannot make this shit up, can you?

Akron

I said it once before and I’ll say it again: no MACtion?

Oklahoma

This wasn’t unlike a UConn tournament game as of late. Normally, they kick the shit out of opponents and leave the carcasses for the rats. But with that drop off in talent, it would be a lot harder to put away opponents, even with Oklahoma being a mid-ass team. In fact at the half, the Sooners were in a good position. They were trailing closely but weren’t shooting well. They were due. And UConn was racking up the fouls quickly. But somehow, UConn just didn’t falter. Goes to show that even with them down, they still have the grit to carry on. Oklahoma will have to carry their Schooner back home.

Xavier

\*Cincinnati Bungle music plays\*

Congrats Xavier on getting rid of that burnt orange cancer known as Texas. Your reward is getting another burnt orange opponent; and this time, it’s a real contender. Illinois just dowsed the Musketeers with their 3-point shooting. How could anyone stop Will Riley while hot? Not them. Don’t feel bad, Cincy fans. Opening day is next week. They always got this huge festival outside Great American. Nowadays that’s the only thing Cincinnati people look forward to until football season because the Reds will ultimately disappoint yet again. In other words, Cincy, enjoy the long offseason.

Bryant

Goddamn, I didn’t know March Madness was a nickname for a UFC event. Eric Timberlake for Bryant got busted open badly after taking an elbow hit. He was fine, but safety above everything else. Bryant hung in there for a half, then it just crashed down. You just got Tom Izzo’d. \*SWAMP IZZO tag\* I DIDN’T CALL YOU SWAMP! I said TOM Izzo! Are you fucking deaf?! GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE! Ahem. As I was saying, big bad Michigan State moves on as Izzo passes Bill Self for all-time in March Madness wins (for now).

Liberty

The Conservatives are gonna get so pissed when they found out their school just lost to the state school where hard drugs are legal. Told you they’re tournament-ready.

The First Round was kind of... bland. There were upsets (10th and 12th seeds especially), but all of the Cinderella seeds are all gone. The SEC has lost half of its teams. The ACC and Big East are in even worse shape, and the Big Ten is still undefeated. And the Big 12 is still the Big 12. Will anything drastic change in Round 2?

I wanted to say this dystopian world is much different from when you and i were in middle school. Fam friends were getting into HYPSM by running a few clubs with afterschool jobs along with volunteer work. All the things we kind of consider cliche now. 


Point being, don’t get too caught up in these apps. You have one life, most likely you are close to the top 1% of this world (if you’re a us citizen). Live life and work hard together, but you aren’t defined by college admissions. 

College admissions aren’t the ticket to Goldman or Mckinsey or Jane Street or Harvard Law or Yale Med. the grind begins there. In the 1990s/2000s sure not now tho. 

Coffee chats in suits for clubs, networking endlessly, applying to many jobs and facing a lot of rejection. 

And i’d say I’m a good student taking rigorous coursework. You’ll see friends whose parents run firms getting MBB internships as freshmen. 

If you’re on that grind i respect. But know the grind doesn’t stop. 

You’ll burn out and fail if you think college apps mean the world. Because that’s only 1 part of the game. 

Going to a great school helps, but remember, the ones who will succeed in this world will hunt for success no matter the odds or outcome.
