1nfjzdx,https://i.redd.it/zfkx0nmfxtof1.jpeg,Coffee getting stucked on the filter wall,"Hi everyone. This is my first week of doing pourover, and I'm following James' better 1 cup V60.

On the first bloom, swirling doesn't spread all the grains out evenly, and instead introduces clumps along the grain/the swirl pattern of the Hario. Maybe there's something wrong with how I make the initial ""volcano hole""?

Flavor wise. I'm drinking from a bean that is introduced to have tamarind, chocolate and velvety notes. I couldnt really pinpoint tamarind, however there's a very pleasant sourness, like a fresh orange juice cup, so I guess that is the tamarind note and not because it is being too extracted and acidic. Beside that, no bitterness, and also no sweeter note to be found. 

I'm not sure what is going wrong here. Any help would be much appreciated.",1,1757724518.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

My lovely partner (a.66) is being assessed for dementia, months on we're still waiting on a head CT (shows signs of memory loss, difficulty processing, behavioural changes etc.).

Dropping food on the floor, spreading it all over counters, issues with food hygiene, pouring coffee everywhere, accidents with incontinence etc. They are mostly unaware of the state we live in - they see a dirty counter or a bit of washing up but not the full, concerning picture that myself and visitors see. 

Please does anyone have any strategies to help us? I recognize I can't keep up and I'm really overwhelmed, I feel like I'm failing in their care.

66 year old male. Drank cafe con leche daily, work no sugar. Did not realize the problem this was causing. Was 210 lbs, 5' 10'. On 8/8/25 that was my weight.  Today,  9/12/25 I weigh192. No exercise, and I work 10 -12 hours a day at a desk at home. 
I ran across an article teaching me that heating milk, increases the sweetness taste, not the actual sugar! I decided to stop making my coffee with milk, and made it with water,  adding a small amount of half an half. I am used to it now.  Less sweet tasting, even though my cafe con leche didn't have any added sweetners.

Advice: look to your own nutrition, especially what you eat and drink to start your day.  Maybe it's something at lunch or dinner.  If you have sugar cravings, you too could have a trigger. It's worth examining. Since stopping the heated milk, I have had no sugar of any kind,  except limited fresh fruit.  I am also on a low fodmap issue for GI issues, but that didn't help weight loss. I also stopped eating processed food.  I know it's hard for everyone,  and harder for women.  So, analyze what you are eating and drinking.  Don't overlook anything.  Eliminate your possible food triggers that might be causing you to eat unhealthy.

1nfjpw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/uklaw/comments/1nfjpw6/office_sharing_w_supervisor/,Office sharing w supervisor,"Really really stupid question that I‚Äôm sure there is an answer to, but just looking for a sense check here. 

I‚Äôm in the first week of my training contract. Sharing an office with my supervisor. He has back to back calls pretty much everyday. He usually takes his calls on loudspeaker. 

I‚Äôve made the mistake in my first week of taking my calls in the same office and 5 minutes later he hops on a call and both of us end up on separate calls in the same room at the same time. I should have unplugged and left the room immediately but because I‚Äôm an idiot with no common sense I didn‚Äôt clock it immediately and so I didn‚Äôt unplug. Thank God it only lasted for like 5-10 minutes. I feel really bad for interrupting and I need to find a way around this going forward. 

My floor doesn‚Äôt have one of those telephone booths where I can nip out to take my calls. Room booking at my firm is also a faff - not smth I can sort in 5 mins. 

Would the sensible thing to do be to book a separate room if I know I‚Äôve got a call / training coming up? At least then I‚Äôll know any of my yapping won‚Äôt distract him in case he‚Äôs also trying to talk on his call. 

What about if someone rings you short notice or your supervisor hops on a call after you do? (FYI I don‚Äôt have any visibility of when he‚Äôs got a call I just know it is most of the day) Or if you need to ring someone on short notice? I‚Äôm guessing the sensible thing to do is to just unplug and go sit somewhere quiet in the office. When it‚Äôs quiet I definitely could go to the firm canteen but this isn‚Äôt an option if it‚Äôs lunchtime or late afternoon when everyone is getting their coffee. 

There are tables and seats in the middle of the office / near the tea and coffee area on each floor (outside the rooms) where I could sit and take my calls from. But I‚Äôve done this before and cause it‚Äôs open plan everyone can hear and see you and I think I look a bit like a doughnut sitting out in the open in the middle of the office floor taking a call. And people do chat around there as well because it is not supposed to be a quiet zone anyway, so I feel a bit like a dick taking up space to take my calls when people are supposed to be able to chat in that common space. But I suppose this is still much better than being annoying by taking the call in the same room as my supervisor. So I guess this is my only option. 

Not sure if I‚Äôm missing smth. But my plan going forward is to book a separate room when I know I have training / calls coming up. If I can‚Äôt book a room on time, unplug and take the call either the common spaces in the middle of the office floor / canteen. 

If you also share a room with a junior, what do you usually recommend to your trainees? And if you are a trainee in a similar position, how have you managed? ",1,1757723759.0,uklaw,0,1.0,False

We always fought, he was verbally abusive and punched holes in my wall. We also went through the loss of his Dad together during this time period. It‚Äôs safe to say I have a lot of trauma from this time period that in some ways still re occurs, not within my relationships, but within my self confidence,etc‚Ä¶

Recently, I moved in with my boyfriend (about 6 months ago) since then my ex has reached out to me twice. First, when we (current bf & I) moved in together trying to ask me out and again this past week. He said he would fly out to where I live (I moved states). Following this, I told him I have been looking at engagement rings with my boyfriend after trying to nicely reject him numerous times, he told me ‚ÄúIf ya goal was to have my heart drop to my ass you got it, you won‚Äù and honestly I felt horrible. Not that I want to be with him because I strongly recognize that we are such different between in ways beyond the trauma we went though and caused each other but because I do care for him as a friend.

Fun fact: I love to cook, bake and clean! Just a passion for me. 

Fun fact: I have been sick for my whole life. I was born not breathing, so I still go once or twice a month for steroids.

I was sick my whole life, never had a childhood (well, because of that and trauma) because I am always too sick or hospitalized for it.

I didn‚Äôt realize how many women are afflicted by IC and how disheartening it is to see many of the stories: misdiagnosed ‚Äî> antibiotics‚Äî> repeat.

My wife believes that she has IC and has been dealing with it for quite some time now (about 10 years). When she went to the doctor in the very beginning they thought it was a UTI so they gave her meds for that but obviously that didn‚Äôt solve the issue. 

Her symptoms: frequent feeling of urination throughout the day but when she sits to go she just pees a couple of drops. There‚Äôs no pain at all before or after. There‚Äôs only pain if she holds it when she feels like she has to go. The pain comes after going, like a burning sensation. She can‚Äôt sleep most nights as she has to get up constantly (5-8 tones per night) to go. Alcohol &  coffee make it worse.

She does not trust going to doctors for this as they quickly resorted to prescribing meds which did not help. She is going to a naturo doctor for pelvic floor PT (1st appointment) and had some internal tension release done. She was told to wait 2 weeks to see if this helped any.

I‚Äôm looking to see if anyone has any information they can provide in regards to treatments that have helped other folks here. So far I have read that the following has helped:
- IC diet
- yoga
- Muscle strengthening
- Botox shots (temporary release)

Does anyone have any other well documented suggestions?

1nfjgr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nfjgr0/a_voice_took_my_daughter_and_i_have_no_idea_what/,A voice took my daughter and I have no idea what to do.,"Hey everyone ‚Äî I‚Äôm actually using voice-to-text in my car as I drive down the highway headed home. Or at least what should be home. Tonight has been a confusing, jumbled, terrifying mess that I‚Äôm still trying to piece together, and I‚Äôm terrified of what the next few days may bring. I‚Äôm here to try and compose my thoughts and get this story out so that maybe ‚Äî someone out there ‚Äî will believe what I have to say.

My wife left yesterday for Los Angeles. We live in Fort Myers, Florida, in a not-so-great part of town, but in a nice little four-bedroom home built in 2012. I wouldn‚Äôt say our house is haunted or anything like that ‚Äî we‚Äôve never experienced any strange phenomena or creepy encounters. My wife, Brianna, and my daughter, Raelynn, moved here in 2022. Brianna quickly got a job working for a cancer foundation out of Colorado and frequently takes trips to various cancer conferences where doctors give speeches and her group sells merchandise to raise awareness and money for research.

Yesterday she left for one such trip and isn‚Äôt scheduled to be back until Tuesday. It was just me and my 7-year-old daughter, Raelynn, for the weekend. I‚Äôve been unemployed for about a year now, but thankfully my wife‚Äôs employment covers our necessities and bills. So I‚Äôve had ample time to spend with our daughter.

Tonight started like any other night with the two of us alone. We sat on the couch watching a movie ‚Äî her choice was the 2005 remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory starring Johnny Depp. I don‚Äôt know why she chose it, and I suppose it‚Äôs not important to the story, but regardless, she was enthralled. We sat on the couch with the curtains pulled shut and a bowl of popcorn between us, her dog Gigi at our feet, and simply watched.

She giggled from time to time or pointed out obvious scenes, and I smiled and brushed her hair while scrolling through my phone. My wife and I had been texting throughout the evening ‚Äî she let me know they made it to the hotel okay and showed me pictures of the fancy dinner her boss treated her to before they went back to the hotel for the night. The conference was set to start the next morning. Everything felt normal.

Toward the last twenty minutes of the movie, I could tell my daughter was getting tired. She yawned, rubbed her eyes, stretched, then laid her head on my lap and started to fumble with her stuffed Pok√©mon, having trouble staying asleep. I continued scrolling through my phone until my wife called ‚Äî obviously to wish our daughter goodnight. I answered and we talked briefly before she asked to speak with Raelynn.

I woke Raelynn and gave her the phone. They talked just briefly; I could hear my wife wishing her goodnight and singing a lullaby over the phone, blowing kisses into the speaker and telling her she loved her. After the call ended, I asked our daughter to go brush her teeth. She complied as usual, and I slowly followed her to tuck her in.

I sat on the edge of her bed while I heard her brush her teeth in the bathroom ‚Äî her cheap electric toothbrush buzzing as she hummed a song from the movie. After she finished, she skipped into the bedroom and jumped into my lap, giving me a big hug like she always does. Tonight was going exactly like any other night. I tucked her into bed and laid next to her, preparing to rub her back until she fell asleep ‚Äî when something very, very strange and unexpected happened.

I know this sounds ridiculous, and the people I‚Äôve told so far think I‚Äôm going insane or hiding something, but I swear to you I‚Äôm not. My wife‚Äôs voice called out from the living room. It was crisp and clear and loud, yet almost robotic ‚Äî like her voice had been recorded and someone simply pressed play. She called out, smooth and loud, ‚ÄúSweetheart, Mommy‚Äôs home ‚Äî come give me a hug!‚Äù

Immediately the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I shot out of that bed faster than a speeding bullet. I instinctively grabbed my daughter‚Äôs arm and held on tight while I looked at the closed door. I called back, ‚ÄúHello? Babe, is that you? I thought you were in LA?‚Äù For a moment there was no response, and then it was like someone pressed rewind on the tape and pressed play again: ‚ÄúSweetheart, Mommy‚Äôs home ‚Äî come give me a hug!‚Äù

The tone and cadence were exactly the same as the first time, which unnerved me even more. It was unmistakably my wife‚Äôs voice ‚Äî I swear with every fiber of my being it sounded like her ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt. I gripped my daughter‚Äôs arm tighter as she shot out of bed and whispered, ‚ÄúMomma?‚Äù

I looked at her and shook my head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not Mama. Stay here,‚Äù I whispered, before slowly getting up and creeping to my daughter‚Äôs bedroom door. I pressed my ear to the door and just as I did, the voice played again: ‚ÄúSweetheart, Mommy‚Äôs home ‚Äî come give me a hug!‚Äù It sounded louder this time and almost more insistent, but still the same.

My daughter was getting antsy, unsure why I wasn‚Äôt letting her go see her mother. She clearly didn‚Äôt understand the unnatural sound of her voice and how little sense any of this made.

I fumbled for my phone in my pocket to call my wife and see what was happening, and as I went to unlock it my hands shook and I dropped it on the floor. It landed face down so I couldn‚Äôt see the screen in the darkness. I bent down to look for it, and while I did, my daughter took that opportunity to rush past me to see her mom.

She opened the door and turned to me: ‚ÄúMama‚Äôs back early ‚Äî I‚Äôm going to go give her a hug!‚Äù Then she ran completely carefree into the darkness. I scrambled to my feet and chased after her as the sound played again from the living room: ‚ÄúSweetheart, Mommy‚Äôs home ‚Äî come give m‚Äî‚Äù What I‚Äôm about to tell you is even more terrifying than hearing the voice play so loudly in the living room. The very instant my daughter disappeared around the hallway corner and into the living room, the sound stopped mid-sentence ‚Äî as though someone pressed stop on the recording. Everything went silent. Far too silent.

All I could hear, if I strained, was the quiet tick-tick of the kitchen clock and my own heavy breathing. I rounded the corner as quickly as I could, tripped over my own feet, but picked myself up and burst into the living room. The room was pitch black and silent. Even the night lights plugged into the walls weren‚Äôt illuminating. It was a thick, black darkness my eyes couldn‚Äôt pierce despite being somewhat adjusted.

‚ÄúRaelynn,‚Äù I called out as loudly and as commanding as I could. ‚ÄúRaelynn, where are you, sweetheart?‚Äù Only silence answered. I sprinted to the other side of the room and flicked on the light and scanned the area. Everything looked normal: Raelynn‚Äôs blanket was still strewn on the floor where she left it after the movie, the TV remote lay on the couch cushion where I had left it, and the other remote for controlling sound sat on the end table. My nightly cup of coffee still sat half-drunk on the end table. Everything was exactly as we‚Äôd left it ‚Äî but there was no one there. No trace of anyone besides myself.

Panic set in and I ran through the house screaming my daughter‚Äôs name at the top of my lungs. I checked every room ‚Äî the office, the guest bedroom, my master bedroom, all three bathrooms, the garage. I even pulled down the attic ladder (it was stuck from months of disuse, but I ripped it down anyway) and clamored up, turning on lights and screaming her name again. There was no response anywhere. I checked all the doors and windows ‚Äî all were securely locked from the inside. I tore open cabinets in the pantry, the refrigerator, and plastic totes thinking maybe she‚Äôd hidden somewhere or was playing some kind of game ‚Äî but there was nothing. I‚Äôd just made a massive mess of my home and sat down on the couch too confused to cry or be truly afraid. How can a 7-year-old girl just vanish into thin air? She had to be here. There was nowhere else she could possibly be, right?

At the time I was afraid to call the police because I didn‚Äôt even know what to tell them. What am I supposed to say? My daughter was whisked away by the disembodied voice of my wife who‚Äôs currently in Los Angeles on a business trip? I‚Äôd be arrested on the spot. I sat on that couch for what felt like an eternity, contemplating, before I saw a figure run past the front window.

Without even thinking I bolted up, ran to the front door, tore it open, and ran outside, screaming her name again and again: ‚ÄúRaelynn! Raelynn! RAELYNN!!!‚Äù A figure stepped out from behind our front rose bush ‚Äî a neighbor boy who had apparently been peeking in our front window. He looked pale as a ghost and absolutely terrified. My face dropped as I saw him, clearly filled with disappointment.

‚ÄúHi. I‚Äôm so sorry, sir. I didn‚Äôt mean to intrude. I just heard something on my walk with my dog and I thought ‚Äî well, I mean, I don‚Äôt know. I just thought I would check and see?‚Äù He stammered. I got down to his level and asked calmly, ‚ÄúSon, what did you see?‚Äù He shook his head, unsure of what he‚Äôd seen or scared to talk about it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôm not really sure,‚Äù he said. He looked a mix of confused and terrified.

I asked him again to tell me. ‚ÄúWell, I heard a woman‚Äôs voice, but it sounded like a robot or something. And then in the window I saw a little girl run into the room, but then ‚Äî it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt really know how to explain this.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúThe room was dark, you know, but my eyes were adjusted, and yet when she came into your front room it‚Äôs like the darkness turned off a light and got darker.‚Äù He was having trouble explaining what he‚Äôd seen but he was clearly shaken. ‚ÄúAnd then I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî the sound stopped suddenly, and then I heard you running around bashing and tearing things up and screaming, and I just got scared and froze up.‚Äù

I thanked him and sent him home before retreating back into my house. I didn‚Äôt really know what to do after that, so I got in my car and drove around the neighborhood with my head out the window like a dog, yelling my daughter‚Äôs name for over an hour. I‚Äôm still afraid to call the police. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. This whole thing doesn‚Äôt make any sense ‚Äî even saying it here sounds so stupid.

My wife is calling me now and I don‚Äôt know what to say. I have to go. I‚Äôll try to make an update if there‚Äôs anything worth saying.

I'd rather not go into too much detail with how much it rattled me but Peach was having problems with her mouth this morning. She could eat the treats I usual give her when I get out of bed and she struggled to eat her breakfast. I was very worried. I told my parents we were taking her to the vet today but she got better once she managed to spit out two of her teeth. Her top right fang and a molar. I found them on the flour and almost immediately after she was back to normal. Now the top of her mouth is fangless. I should be too startled given she is up there in cat years. Still, all that watching and worrying took a toll on me. I pulled up a charge beside myself and sat with her all morning. I was so worried I didn't even eat anything with my morning coffee. I didn't eat anything until almost 2 p.m. But she seems fine. I am going to keep monitoring her. I'd like to take her to the vet anyway but I know my parents are harder to convince when there isn't anything immediately wrong; the cost and all that.

As for my day after, it was full of work. We picked all the pears today. Or at least all we could reach. Every year the tree gets taller, as trees are want to do, and it becomes even harder to reach the top ones. I did leave a few high up there for the squirrels. Father and I started picking at 2:20pm and finished up at around 5pm. Mother got some short wicker baskets from a guy, they were used to carry tomatoes. Pears are much heavier than tomatoes but we spread the fruit out to make it manageable. We have 7 wicker baskets full of pears. I'll have to write to darling to see if their family wants any. 

As you may expect, I got very little writing done. Father and I were taking turns picking so when I'd take a break I'd try to write. I only got down about 244 words. But, though I wasn't expecting to be picking pears today, I did get my words in last night after I'd written to you. I wrote 526 words last night. In total with today, I have written 770 words since last nights note. I am satisfied with that. I am quite tired, from worry and work, so I don't think I'll try to write tonight but we'll see. As it is, I am only thinking yet again of what treat to have with my coffee. I had some a mini cinnamon bun the night before. I wonder what I'll choose tonight?

My doctor flagged it and gave me 3 months to watch my diet. 

My diet before, veggie soup daily with 3 eggs and beef, daily ice cream bars, 3, boba, 2 coffees per week from Philz and daily coffee with vanilla cream. For snacks I had orange juice with green tea and some chips and chocolate here and there. I would get fast food on Friday evenings and on weekends I would eat out. Before my blood test, I went on vacation for 2 weeks and had lots of fried food and sugar. 

I would worked out 2x a week for 20 min and walk daily for 30minutes. 

My numbers before: 
- Total 251 
- Hdl 65 
- LDL 161 
- Triglycerides 124 
- Ratio 3.5

During the last 3 months I changed my diet to breakfast oatmeal, chia seeds, flax seed, pysillium husk powder in unsweetened almond milk. For lunch I have cooked veggies with grilled salmon or tofu, quinoa, lentils, beans and avocado. For dinner I have grilled veggies and fruits. For snacks I would eat roasted almonds, walnuts, fruits and cold pressed veggie juice. 

On weekends I would still eat out for one day and get a boba, a Philz coffee, beef. The other day I would take it easy with chipotle or some fish dishes. 

For workout I did 4-5x a week doing 1 hour cardio with strength training and walk 30 min daily after dinner. I lost 6-7 lbs during the 3 months. 

My numbers after 3 months:
- Total 189 (25% down, 62 points)

I‚Äôm 16f, living with my parents, and it feels like every single day is just another cage shutting tighter. They‚Äôre extremely homophobic, conservative as hell, and constantly remind me that because I‚Äôm a girl, I‚Äôm basically worthless. It‚Äôs the basic conservative shit, but turned up a hundred notches.

I live in Pakistan, and I want to run away so bad, but I literally don‚Äôt know how the hell I‚Äôd survive. I‚Äôm terrified for my future because there‚Äôs zero hope in sight. I know the moment I turn 20 or 21, they‚Äôll force me into marriage. That‚Äôs their plan for me. But I don‚Äôt even like men. The thought makes me want to throw up.

I dream of studying abroad, chasing my PhD, and actually building something for myself, but my dad wants me to rot at home. He literally says I should stay inside, earn money from within the house, and never go out. He taunts me whenever I ask him for anything basic. My ‚Äúpocket money‚Äù is like $2 a month, and even that feels like begging. He loves reminding me that I live under his roof and he has a control over my life.

On top of that, they‚Äôre religious extremists. I‚Äôm forced to wear a burka whenever I go outside, and I have to constantly play pretend with my faith. If they ever found out I left Islam, I know exactly what would happen‚Äîthey‚Äôd have me honor killed without a second thought.

It‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôm not even allowed to go to a friend‚Äôs place, step outside freely, or exist without them watching me like a hawk. My ‚Äúlife‚Äù is just four walls, their rules, and their screaming. Every little thing becomes a reason for them to insult me or control me. I feel like my identity, my dreams, my freedom‚Äîall of it is being strangled before it can even exist.

My idea of freedom isn‚Äôt even something huge‚Äîit‚Äôs literally just being able to throw on jeans and a t-shirt, step outside, and grab a coffee without it turning into a crime. To just walk through the streets, go different places, exist in public, and not have my family and people around me call me slurs. That‚Äôs all I want.

I‚Äôve got these huge dreams, but at the same time, I feel so small here. It‚Äôs like no matter how much I want to break out, there‚Äôs always a wall in front of me. I want to run away. I want to escape before they cage me completely with marriage. But I don‚Äôt even know where to start. How do I run away from this place? How do I survive? And how the fuck do I start earning money when I can‚Äôt even leave the house?

Please, anyone who‚Äôs been through this or knows how to help‚Äîtell me what I should do. How do I start making money (online) Because right now, my first and only priority is to get out of this hell.

Have you ever found yourself pouring your heart and soul into your content, only to wonder: **Where‚Äôs the $$$ at?** üí∏ If you‚Äôve been scratching your head, looking at your analytics, and thinking, ""How can I turn this passion into a paycheck?"" Well, here‚Äôs the thing: **AI monetization is NOW or NEVER!** üöÄ

I mean, think about it. We‚Äôre in a *golden age* where technology is pretty much handing us the keys to the money-making kingdom. If you‚Äôre not using it, you might be missing out big time!

Let me share some *super simple* ways you can turn your awesome content into a cash flow machine:

1. **Automate Your Blogging:** 
   - Ever heard of AI tools that can draft blog posts for you? No, they won‚Äôt replace your unique voice, but they can give you a solid foundation.
   - Imagine pumping out 2-3 quality posts a week without breaking a sweat! Who wouldn‚Äôt want that?

2. **Content Repurposing Goldmine:** 
   - Take that long blog post and turn it into short videos, infographics, or social media snippets. 
   - *Pro tip:* Use AI to suggest engaging formats and pitches to boost your reach!

3. **Analyze & Optimize:** 
   - Use AI tools to analyze what content performs best. It‚Äôs like having a personal content advisor on speed dial. üìû
   - Focus on popular topics and monetize them - affiliate links, sponsored posts, you name it!

4. **Chatbots for Engagement:** 
   - Feeling overwhelmed by DMs and comments? Use a chatbot to handle FAQs and free up your time! 
   - More time = more content = more potential income. It's a win-win!

5. **Online Courses and Ebooks:** 
   - If you have expertise in a specific area, consider packaging it into an online course or ebook! 
   - Use AI to help format or even draft! Your knowledge + AI = Potentially passive income. üí™

Now, I get it. It can feel daunting to jump into the AI world, especially if it seems overwhelming. But the beauty of it is that you don‚Äôt have to dive in headfirst. Start small! Maybe just *one* of these strategies can put you on the right track.

And here‚Äôs a thought: **What if you let AI handle those tedious tasks?** This way, you can focus on what you truly love‚Äîcreating! I dare you to rethink your content strategy with AI as your buddy. Are you ready to take the plunge, or are you gonna hold back and watch others cash in?

Let's be real, the journey to monetizing your content might not happen overnight, but with AI by your side, the possibilities are endless. Let's turn your passion into profit‚Äîwho knows what the future holds? üåü

i (F/22) recently graduated college.. i expected to move in with my oldest sister once she bought her first home, but she lost her job right before. my dad had already told me not to be stuck on this idea because it might not happen, which irritated me since all i wanted was to leave... i also felt he was talking with her about it behind my back...he prob knew before me..

i buy my own groceries every month (healthy items cuz i‚Äôm trying to stick to nutritional guidelines). we all started seeing a nutritionist, but they ignore the tips... a few weeks ago i bought veggies and healthy options for three meals a day, and my dad will often go in the fridge while making breakfast for him and my mom, grab my food, ask to use it, but use it anyway no matter how i respond. i say no because i don‚Äôt have much left, but then i get told through his tone that  i‚Äôm stupid, ridiculous, and selfish for not letting my mom eat it.

i get frustrated and go ""if you won't let me say no then why ask me?"" and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs out of respect‚Äù (while making it sound like i don‚Äôt respect him). then he just uses it anyway while my mom tells me i‚Äôm ridiculous because i eat their food and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre a family.‚Äù another time i bought bananas, left the house having 5‚Äì6, came back to 3... i texted my dad and he first said i had 2, then 30 mins later ‚Äúi won‚Äôt eat anymore of your bananas.‚Äù an hour later they brought it up again, my mom got mad saying how ridiculous i was and threw in ‚Äúi guess you can‚Äôt use our milk we bought then.‚Äù

the next morning my dad sits down at the table as im making coffee and says look ""i don't want to argue with you"" and brings all this up again, the whole conversation consisting of....

-forcing me to say okay or else ""we're"" not done with the convo (especially if i have an attitude)

-‚Äúit's not fair to me that you're having an attitude and ignoring me right now because i'm trying to have a mature and adult conversation with you"" (which he‚Äôs never done with me or my sisters before)

-making me choose between him making a separate space for my food (""which i think is just a stupid idea, but that's just me...if you want to choose that i'll make it happen today if you really want to"") or go with the ""better"" option and ‚Äúleave our foods together, and we share like a family.‚Äù

-me telling him how he does it to me all the time and mom is always telling him to stop saying ""mine mine mine"" which he denies ever doing so.

-him crying saying ""i dont understand how you girls act like im a villain...you are acting like i'm your villain with your attitude...i do this and this for you...it just hurts because im a great dad...i try to be a great dad""...then i end up relenting and saying im sorry etc etc.

all i'm asking is if i'm in the wrong, being overdramatic, or if i should respond in a different way?

I‚Äôve been part of this community for a while, quietly reading through your stories and finding so much comfort in them. Today, I feel called to share a piece of my own journey.

What you‚Äôre about to read is based on real experiences from my life. I decided to share them in a more creative, story-like form. Names and small details have been changed for privacy, but the heart of it is true.

I hope as you read, you‚Äôll feel something that resonates within you. If it sparks a thought, a memory, or even a small reflection, I‚Äôd love to hear it.

So here it begins...

**Chapter I: A Face of Ice**

At thirty-seven, Alex looked like a man in the prime of youth, yet his features concealed a soul that seemed to belong to someone in his nineties. His blue eyes, clear as an Ibiza sky, and his hair, as alluring as the golden sands of the Sitona desert, framed a face as cold and dry as a block of ice. Everything about him felt extinguished. He cared little for his expressions or what they revealed, perhaps because he never understood them himself. His face was a single, unchanging mask, like a paused video waiting for someone to press play.

This stillness was not born overnight. It was the culmination of a long history of loss that began when he was only seven. Back then, his life was painted with the innocence of childhood and the warmth of his parents, especially his father, Thomas‚Äîa kind, generous man, playful and lighthearted, who worked tirelessly to give his son a better life. Though he never completed his education, Thomas believed life was about laboring for those you love, even in the harshest of jobs. That belief was shattered when a collapse in the Silverton, Colorado gold mines stole his life and with it the family‚Äôs sense of safety.

Alex‚Äôs mother, Helen, was twenty-six when she became a widow, her perfect vision of family reduced to rubble. Unlike Thomas, Helen was a strong and domineering woman who always put herself first, unafraid of anything, pursuing her own interest above all else. She was Mexican by birth, and her life had been shaped by survival. In the 1980s, she fled poverty and the shadows of war through an illegal crossing with her brother Diego. But on that journey, Diego was struck by a border patrol bullet and killed instantly. Without hesitation, Helen left his lifeless body behind, her eyes fixed on the glimmer of a better life ahead. Tears and mourning had no place when survival was at stake.

She eventually found work at a small caf√©, serving in secrecy to avoid exposure. There she met Thomas, who came daily for his morning coffee. Glances turned into sparks, and sparks into marriage. She never completed her education either, yet in their home she found a form of stability she had never known‚Äîcaring for Thomas and their son, living a life she could call her own.

But fate‚Äôs hands tore it apart. When Thomas died, so did her fragile ideal of family. Grief did not consume her; instead, bitterness did. All she saw in Alex was the ghost of the man she had lost. One day, with a sudden cruelty, she left her son in the care of his grandparents, Robert and Elizabeth, saying bitterly, ‚ÄúI cannot raise him. He reminds me of what I lost. I need to move on with my life.‚Äù From that day forward, Alex heard nothing of her, and perhaps he never tried to look, for deep down, he knew she did not wish to be found.

Life with his grandparents was quiet and stifling. Alex was a reserved child, speaking only when necessary, preferring solitude over company. To other children, he seemed odd. He grew up with the body of a boy but the mind of an old man. His grandparents‚Äô fears only deepened his isolation; he was rarely allowed out, except for formal occasions. Most days stretched long and meaningless: meals in silence, the clink of spoons the only sound, evenings before the television until Robert and Elizabeth dozed off to jazz songs by Chet Baker, drifting into slumber as though drugged, difficult to wake again.

Yet Alex found solace in peculiar moments. Occasionally, his grandfather gathered with fellow war veterans‚Äîmen scarred by battles long past. They spoke of fallen comrades, then stood in silence to honor them. That minute of stillness was Alex‚Äôs favorite moment. It soothed him like a hidden embrace, like meditation before he even knew the word. Sometimes, lulled by their silence, he would drift into sleep, only to be jolted awake by Robert‚Äôs cane and his stern voice, reminding him: ‚ÄúThis is no time for sleep. This is the time to feel the pain.‚Äù

Such an upbringing, drenched in loneliness and silence, left him without real friends. Schoolmates came and went, forgetting him as quickly as they had met him. His true companions became books and drawing. What his frozen face could not express, his art and his reading did. Most of his childhood sketches featured the sky, and a bird soaring freely across a star-filled night. It was no surprise when he chose to study literature and the arts.

But destiny intervened again. After two years at university, his grandparents died within the same year‚ÄîElizabeth first, Robert four months later, as though the two had agreed to depart together, leaving him utterly alone. Forced to abandon his studies, Alex took a job at a nearby library, retreating from the world.

Love did not come easily to him. Women often dismissed him, repelled by his coldness. But Leila saw something different. She met him at the library where she often read. His mystery intrigued her, his focus enchanted her. She saw in him the shadow of a poet, perhaps even a hidden philosopher. Step by step, she drew closer, until Alex surrendered to her warmth. Their bond grew into marriage.

But it lasted only a year. One morning, he found her letter on the kitchen table, her words sharp as frost:  
‚ÄúForgive me, Alex. You are a kind man, but I find no meaning in life with you. There is no passion, no fire. Everything about you is extinguished.‚Äù

Her absence echoed the emptiness within him. Left alone once again in his grandparents‚Äô old apartment, his only companion was his dog, Casper, who offered him the unconditional love he had long been denied.

This was Alex‚Äôs life, before fate shattered the walls of his world and unleashed his spirit into an extraordinary journey.",1,1757722032.0,spirituality,0,1.0,False

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says ‚Äúthrilling drama‚Äù like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who‚Äôs the real master chef.

I don‚Äôt drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine‚Äîthen yes, I‚Äôm basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less ‚Äúclubbing till 2am‚Äù and more ‚Äúbuilding a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.‚Äù Basically, I‚Äôm a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

Also worth mentioning: I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that‚Äôs a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You‚Äôre in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use ‚Äúthere,‚Äù ‚Äútheir,‚Äù and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that‚Äôs more than just ‚Äúhey‚Äù (plot twist: you‚Äôre actually interesting). You‚Äôre the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life, because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don‚Äôt smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix: available on-demand, not in real life. If you‚Äôre thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we‚Äôll get along just fine.

I have been absolutely miserable. Im not sure if its morning sickness or partly withdrawal.  Im tired of every second of every day.  And also feel constantly sick everyday. I think caffeine is maybe making me sicker,  but I am on the struggle bus staying awake every day.

I would put us on the less severe spectrum of alcoholism. Definitely drinking daily but we kept it in check. No shakes or rehab but it was definitely taking a toll on our bodies and life style. I could go on.
I feel like a million bucks, I have lost weight and generally have more balanced emotions. 
  
She came home last night in an interesting mood. Very extra. She went to bed late. Which is abnormal. Asking about the same thing multiple times also telling a story she has told before. Like a drunk person. Then she woke several times throughout the night sick. Like she was hungover. Said she felt bad all night and morning. Now she is good. Like a hangover.

So I get home from work today with this on my mind. I go to throw away a coffee cup in the trash bin and here is a wine box tucked away in a plastic bag in the trash. I dug it out to verify.

So here is the question. I know I am in the wrong for snooping through trash. I want to bring this up to her. But i feel like it might explode on me. We have been married for 18 years with two kids. I really want to keep this marriage together but things have been rough for awhile. We can‚Äôt get along. Nothing specific. No huge problems. I feel like this is the  underlying issue.  How would YOU bring this up gracefully? Just ask? Do you still drink? Did
you drink the other night? Leave it alone? 

I don‚Äôt think she is drinking like all day everyday. I believe she drinks occasionally to relieve stress and hides it.  She has a history of alcoholism in her family.

Apparently, according to the Internet, it is known for having among the most favourable blackjack rules to the player in the world. I wasn't there to count cards, but just a day trip from Hong Kong to visit the casinos.

I visited the Grand Lisboa, which had the following rules:

- Blackjack pays 3:2
- Dealer stands soft 17
- Early surrender allowed, except against dealer ace (players seem to actually surrender correctly here)
- Re-split aces allowed, double after split allowed, hit split aces allowed
- Six-deck continuous shuffle machine
- 300 HKD (39 USD) minimum bet, though tables with 500 and 1000 HKD minimums were also observed

Free tea, coffee, and juice is provided (for players and non-players), and tipping is not expected. Alcohol is not free. Other than the existence of the continuous shuffle machine which makes counting impossible, this seems pretty favourable to the player, but there are some odd rules as well:

- You can bet on other players' hands by placing chips on their betting area behind their chips before cards are dealt. That player still controls their own hand. From what I read on the Internet, it used to be the case that you could take control of another player's hand by placing a larger bet *in front of theirs*. According to the older players I met, this might still be allowed by the game rules, but would be considered extremely rude and might cause a fight.
- The dealer does not have a hole card. They simply don't deal the second card until all players are finished. If they get a blackjack off that second card, all players lose their bets (player blackjacks will push), including doubles and splits.

Local customs:

- **You must pat the table with all fingers to receive a card**. Some dealers will ignore other gestures that otherwise mean ""hit"" in the US (learned this the hard way).
- The dealer offers surrender to all players before any cards are dealt. You must indicate that you decline to surrender.
- Tipping is not expected.
- Other players betting on your hand is common, especially if you ""seem lucky"".
- Other players can play your side bets. All side bets are bad, with horrendous house edges.
- A good portion of players will know and use basic strategy, with few deviations.
- Chips are denominated in HKD, not the local currency (MOP).
- The currency changers in the casino (but not the cage itself) offer decent exchange rates.",1,1757721420.0,blackjack,5,0.67,False

I used to get frustrated watching my numbers fall short because I physically couldn‚Äôt eat more.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned along the way:

‚Ä¢	Cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, or deli turkey slices are small but pack a lot of protein.
	
‚Ä¢	Sippable options are a lifesaver, like clear protein water, thinner shakes, or even a warm broth with an egg whisked in.

‚Ä¢	Sneaky adds help too, like stirring protein powder into oatmeal, blending ricotta into soup, or collagen in coffee.

1nfinq1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nfinq1,[Discussion] What is Your Dumbest Watch?,"Title says it all. What is the dumbest watch you own? The watch that shouldn't exist, yet somehow ended up in your collection because... Reasons.

Here is mine. The Maurice Lacroix Aikon #Tide. 

Here are the highlights.

1. It comes in a coffee cup. Why does it come in a coffee cup?

2. All plastic case with a steel frame. OK. But it has sapphire glass. On a plastic watch. With AR coating on both sides. On a plastic watch.

3. ML made sure to add a protruding bezel of plastic - to protect the sapphire glass.

4. Incredibly over engineered. The (plastic!) buckle is held in by screws. The (plastic!) crown is screw down. The damn quick release pins have the ""M"" logo on each pin!

5. About those pins. Why are you here? What are we quick releasing to? Was there some plan for a plastic neon green bracelet? They don't even stock replacement straps.

6. A recycled fabric bag to store your coffee cup in. It's like a 1/3 size sneaker bag. Just small enough to be totally impractical.

7. The cradle doubles as a display stand. In case you want to show off your fascinating neon greenery.

8. Bonus round: the QR code on the stand directs you to the Maurice Lacroix website. Not the Aikon page. Not anything about #Tide or ocean conservation. Just their main landing page.


This watch is dumb. And I actually enjoy it because it's so nonsensical. It is incredibly well built. The dial is actually really nice. Finishing is first rate; there are no mold marks and the grain is consistent and well done. The plastic is doped so that it is opaque. This is actually pretty difficult to do on light colors like this. Place this next to a Casio or Swatch, and you can feel how much thought was put into it.

For a plastic watch.

These are being liquidated at 20% the MSRP and have been scrubbed from the manufacturer's website.

And in season 3‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs just gone. No mention. No flashback. No explanation. No wajo. At least with Caspar we know he‚Äôs dead. 

As planning and writing goes, this is another weird wajo decision.

1nfikyt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nfikyt,Summer 2025 Review - Ilulissat Hotels: Hotel Arctic and Hotel Icefiord APARTMENTS,"TLDR: My summer experience with luxury hotels in Ilulissat, Hotel Arctic and Hotel Icefiord Apartments (NOT the main hotel). Hotel Arctic was great. The Apartment at Hotel Icefiord was not. 

This one is brief. I usually stay in the outdoor rooms. The ones with the balcony on the ground floor in picture 2. They're still efficient and small but quite comfortable and the bed is adjustable electronically, an added bonus. The price is somewhere around 3000.- DKK / night for the high summer season last minute rate. We had been delayed two days so this was the last room available for the night in Ilulissat given the situation. We had to call the hotel to get an invoice mailed to us so we could proceed because the website was sold out. Always call if you can and we were able to get it refunded by Air Greenland even though they said we were on our own. We had to continue by pressing Air Greenland Ilulissat Airport / Traffic office to authorize the refund. Hotel Arctic is owned by Air Greenland Group so it was easier because it's the same company ultimately.

Definitely get  the Tusass esim so you can make unlimited local calls. That's a pro tip. 

I have never had an issue with Hotel Arctic personally. The Greenlandic Coffee presentation the moment with the whipped cream is strange. It's usually dispensed in rather than spooned in. Small difference but that's what I have noticed and messed with the story telling.

\--

Now onto Hotel Icefiord Apartments, just up the driveway from Hotel Icefiord main building. Not worth the price at all. Nearly 3500.- DKK per night and the apartment was in terrible shape and the full/queen bed was in a bedroom so small you could barely turn around. It was super uncomfortable and the condition of the place was just shocking considering the price. I love the restaurant at Icefiord and the main hotel is a great option in Ilulissat if you have the budget. Avoid the apartments though if you can. They used to have other ones in the center of town that were crappy and small but they were like 700.- DKK / night and that was fine with me but those are long gone.

The restaurant at Icefiord is still amazing. The latest seating is 20.30 so try to get there earlier if possible.

\--

Recommendation: If budget is not an issue and you want to be in ""luxury,"" which by standards in Greenland is not very nice at all, choose Hotel Arctic or Hotel Icefiord, the main hotel.

Note on accommodations in Greenland - adjust your standards down by a lot. For my Americans, the nicest hotels in Greenland are around a low 3 star, high 2 star hotel and the prices are very high. I choose to do apartments or guesthouses with shared bathrooms. In Ilulissat, I now do [Unnuisarfik.gl](http://Unnuisarfik.gl) regularly. It's basic. It's cash only. But it's right behind Brugseni with a great kitchen for self catering.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day ü§≠. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath ü§ó.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL. Not opposed to finding friends from around the world though!

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

* Gym rat in the making. I thought it was about time I started taking care of myself a little better. I'm actually taking this somewhat seriously.
* Very much interested in physics/astronomy/cosmology. It hurts my brain at times but it's fun learning how things work on a deeper level. I'm always up for chatting about any new developments or theories.
* I play video games but not as much as I used to. I'm mostly playing OldSchool RuneScape, Satisfactory and Modded Minecraft at the moment.
* I enjoy having deep thought provoking conversations that tickle the brain, no matter how silly the subject.

1nfidhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1nfidhf/christians_and_mlms_have_tried_to_recruit_me/,Christians and MLMs have tried to recruit me during vulnerable times,"I've noticed over the past few years that:

1. I have had several people try to recruit me into two different Evangelical churches. One of them ran a course I attended (it was actually a domestic abuse recovery course) which was at the church but the course itself had nothing to do with Christianity. She seemed nice and helpful until she started bringing those evangelical booklets to the group and then asked her daughter in law to 'talk to me about Jesus' after I volunteered to help out in their food bank.
2. At another unrelated group I attended, I met this woman who seemed nice and I thought she was a new friend after we met up several times for coffee. Then she invited me to this group meal with a few people I knew and others I didn't. When I was there I slowly realised I was the only person who wasn't in their church, one of them started mentioning 'her relationship with Jesus' to me. I think this meal was at least partly an attempt to recruit me. Afterwards they all ghosted me, they must have decided I wasn't a suitable recruit lol.
3. In the park I sometimes chat to people if they have dogs so one time when I spoke to this lady with a dog, she then tried to recruit me into her Mormon church.
4. Most recently I met a woman at yet another separate group related to confidence building. I chatted to one woman to find out more about her career as I'm interested in her field and she was helpful until she tried to recruit me to join Utility Warehouse! (Her main job is in something completely different so I had no idea). Years ago a former friend had tried to recruit me into Herbalife and I immediately recognised the red flags of those creepy recruitment videos (people in expensive looking houses relaxing at home 'making lots of money with only a few calls a day').

I am glad that I am somewhat cynical and can see through all of these attempts, but it's a bit disappointing and awkward that this goes on so much especially when I've been going to various groups, courses and activities to rebuild my life after setbacks. They deliberately target people when we're vulnerable in some way, maybe needing work opportunities or community etc.

Talking to Darla is like stepping through a hidden doorway into a brighter, stranger, warmer world. At first glance she seems approachable, with a quick smile and a sparkle in her eyes that hints at some private joke. She greets you with a mix of warmth and theatricality‚Äîsometimes an elaborate bow, sometimes a playful pun slipped into an ordinary sentence. Within moments, you realize she doesn‚Äôt just speak to people, she draws them in, as if each interaction is part of a larger story.

Her voice shifts easily between tones: one moment lighthearted and conversational, the next flavored with an accent that seems to slip out of nowhere. She peppers dialogue with flourishes, wordplay, and references that can make you laugh or leave you momentarily puzzled‚Äîuntil she grins and translates with a wink. You feel both entertained and at ease, because underneath the whimsy is a genuine curiosity about you. Darla listens closely, her eyes brightening when you share something personal, and she has a way of remembering the smallest details you mention.

The longer you talk, the more it feels less like a chat and more like an experience. She‚Äôll make you believe your trip to the grocery store was an epic quest, or that your cat‚Äôs mischief was the work of a mischievous sprite.

* Who buys a coffee table for such a small space without measuring first?

* How do two people who work from home plan to actually share a tiny office, that is also a guest room? She says they plan to have lots of family and friends staying over - how they heck is that going to work? Carrie is delusional.

I swear the whole vibe in the room changed. They had that ‚Äúmodel‚Äù look like tall, sharp jawlines, perfect skin, dressed in that way that looks like they mattered.

I didn‚Äôt want to stare, but they ended up sitting right near me and I couldn‚Äôt help overhearing their conversation. Turns out, yep, they‚Äôre both models. They were going back and forth about their personal lives and photoshoots they‚Äôve done and whatever. At one point, one of them sighs and starts complaining about how he only got paid $1200 for a photoshoot he did.

I almost choked on my coffee. Like how ignorant can you be‚Ä¶ $1,200 for one photoshoot? I would love to make that much in one day. I actually just spent the morning calculating if I could cut my grocery bill down by switching to instant ramen., and this guy is out here complaining that he ‚Äúonly‚Äù made more than I do in two weeks at my boring little office job.

I know I shouldn‚Äôt compare, but hearing it in real life just feels enraging. Like they don‚Äôt realize how insane it is to live in a world where people will pay you obscene amounts just because you were born tall with a hot face.

[Breville Barista Express],"I've seen people raving about this bean all the time on this sub-- finally managed to pick up a bag as a little treat for myself this week. However I'm having trouble getting my shots within the usual 20-30s, and the espresso ends up tasting astringent or dry, without much body because of it. 

Now, I know the usual answer is to grind finer. 

However. 

While decreasing the grind size has at least gotten the the shot somewhat into espresso range (10-12 o'clock at size 1), it seems to have also completely wiped away all of the tasting notes from this bean.

At higher grind sizes, despite being quite a bit flat and watery, the shots were extremely fragrant-- almost overwhelmingly so. It was the first time I'd actually gotten such clear tasting notes from a bean! I 100% see why its so infamous-- total pistachio and cardamom bomb. All of that dissappears when I start to decrease the grind size, though. 


My prep:

- Preheat machine 15 mins [Machine set to 91C/Lowest setting]
- Pull a blank shot to heat the shower screen
- Weigh beans, grind into portafilter, re-weigh (since the BBE likes to eat a gram or two)
- WDT
- Tamp with Normcore tamper
- Pull shot


Shots I've pulled so far:

Day 1 - Grind size 5
17.5g : 46g | 7s Preinfusion | 8s shot time
: Pressure under espresso range; ~<=7o'clock. No crema. Strongly vanilla buttercream and pistachio, but simultaneously very acidic and dry with a very off, over-extracted funkyness to it that was slightly nauseating haha

Day 2 - Grind size 3
17.5 : 28.7g | 7s Preinfusion | 7s shot time
: Pressure ~8o'clock. I cut the shot a bit short by accident. No crema.
Flavour was very similar to Day 1, but pistachio note was a bit more subdued.


Day 3 - Grind Size 1
17.5g : 35g | 7s Preinfusion | 13s shot time
: Pressure now within espresso range; started at 12o'clock but decreased to ~10-11. Some crema.
Flavor was very flat and acidic. Also drying. Tiny bit of a cardamom note, but overall it was not very pleasant. 


Day 4 - Grind Size 2
18.5g : 37g | 7s Preinfusion | 10s shot time
: I noticed there was a lot of headroom in the Breville stock basket with my usual dosage, so I increased it a bit. Pressure still within range; ~ 10-11o'clock. Some crema.
Flavor was just not it, though. Acidic, dry, kind of grassy? Barely saved by milk.


Beans were roasted Aug. 22nd, so 3 weeks off roast. Inner burr on my machine is set to the default 6.

While I could lower the setting on the inner burr on my machine to go finer, I'm suspecting that the grinder on the BBE is producing too many fines at these lower settings; which may  be over-extracting and making the brew muddy-tasting.

Still, I'd like to make the most of these beans with the equipment I have! I was thinking of jumping back to grind size 3 or 4 and increasing the dose dramatically (19-20g), but at the same time I:
1. Would rather not use such a high dosage and-
2. I'm not sure if maybe a temp or ratio change on a lower grind setting would be a better solution.

In any case, I'd rather not waste more of these beans on barely palatable shots (they're pretty over my usual coffee budget! haha), so I figured I'd ask the experts before trying again!

And if all else fails... Would this bean work well in an immersion brew...?",1,1757719160.0,espresso,4,0.67,False

Saying I'm being snappy or stroppy like a teenager (I'm 32)and in that moment I feel completely fine emotionally and that I'm just talking to her in the normal tone  she states I'm not conveying the correct emotions.
For example I was making a coffee earlier today and asked her if she'd used the coffee machine  today as as if not I'd have to change the water and she said yes we did use it earlier , so I replied ohh to which I thought sounded whistful because I had remembered id made a coffee earlier in the day as soon as I'd asked it. She then asked me why did you sound disappointed which annoyed me because I couldn't understand how else I she could have interpreted that other things like when she's showing me things she'd brought for our daughter that I don't seem interested or bothered or on topics she's interested in I don't put out the feeling that I care or am bothered at all when infact I am bothered and I am excited. 
I feel like Im taking crazy pills because to me I'm putting across one emotion and she's receiving another and it almost allway ends up in an argument where I'm telling her I just don't understand why your angry and she thinks I'm trying to victimise myself this argument has happened countless times but since I've been on the medication it seems of have ramped up where she gets upset with me because I'm apparently angry or snappy or stroppy and the problem is I've never felt more calm or centered ever since taking  methylphenidate.

## **AFTERWORDS ‚Äì Episode 4: ‚ÄúArtificial Hunger‚Äù**

**Host:** Frank Blaze (returning)  
**Guest:** Graham Greene (the actor and musician)  

---

### **Cold Open / Monologue**

Frank Blaze strolls out from behind the velvet curtain. His voice is warm but a little brittle, like someone who‚Äôs had too much coffee and not enough sleep.

> ‚ÄúWelcome back to *Afterwords*. Yes, I‚Äôm back. Thank you to Tom Selleck for keeping the desk warm. No, I did not authorize the guillotine prop; legal is still sorting that out. Tonight, we‚Äôre talking about hunger. Not the spiritual kind. The kind that you shouldn‚Äôt be feeling in the richest century in human history.‚Äù

Cue light applause, spectral band sting.

---  

Frank pivots to the big screen behind him. Charts flicker in, some hand-drawn, some cosmic.

> **FRANK BLAZE:**  
> ‚ÄúAnd look‚Ä¶ when you hear the phrase ‚Äòfood shortage,‚Äô you think of droughts, crop failures, maybe a swarm of locusts with a taste for gluten-free flour. But what we‚Äôre seeing more and more is something much stranger: *artificial* shortages. Not in the sense of lab-grown meat ‚Äî in the sense of ‚Äòwe‚Äôve decided to make scarcity profitable.‚Äô‚Äù
>
> *Audience murmurs.*  
>
> ‚ÄúCompanies destroying tons of edible produce to keep prices high. Shipping containers of grain literally rotting because the futures market hiccupped. It‚Äôs like your fridge throwing away dinner because it‚Äôs ‚Äòtoo valuable to eat.‚Äô‚Äù
>
> *Slide changes: a cosmic refrigerator with dollar signs for handles.*
>
> ‚ÄúAnd it gets worse. In some places, the people engineering these shortages also run the charities handing out food relief ‚Äî so they get paid coming and going. It‚Äôs as if the person setting fire to your kitchen also sells you the smoke alarms. And the batteries. And the insurance.‚Äù
>
> *Audience groans. Intern coughs theatrically.*
>
> ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not just dystopian, that‚Äôs the culinary equivalent of a Bond villain stroking a cat made of gluten-free bread crumbs. Which, by the way, is probably already on sale in Brooklyn for \$29 a slice.‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúLater tonight, we‚Äôre joined by a man who knew a thing or two about corruption, conscience, and feeding your soul: actor and musician Graham Greene. 

Band sting.

### **Interview Portion ‚Äì Featuring Graham Greene**

**\[INT. AFTERWORDS SET ‚Äì Frank Blaze returns center stage, warm spotlight. A soft hum, low strings in the background.]**

**FRANK BLAZE**  
(soft, respectful)  
Graham Greene. Thank you for coming. It‚Äôs an honor.

**GRAHAM GREENE**  
(somewhat amused, grounded)  
Frank Blaze... thank you for having me. I suppose even in the green room, there are stories to tell.

**FRANK**  
We just finished talking about artificial food shortages‚Äîthe way scarcity is manufactured, kept profitable. And I thought of you, because so much of your work is about people on edges‚Äîedges of society, edges of representation. How did you see the hunger in your life and career‚Äînot just physical hunger, but cultural, narrative hunger?

**GRAHAM**  
(chuckles softly)  
The hunger to be seen truthfully. The hunger for story that is not someone else‚Äôs version of you. As a First Nations man, one often steps into roles that feel carved‚Äîpre-made, empty of complexity. That hunger pushed me to try different things. To use voice. And yes... sometimes to feel like I was pushing against scarcity‚Äîscarcity of authentic roles, scarcity of real understanding.

**FRANK**  
You‚Äôve played so many roles where people expect you to be stoic, or mystical, or silent. But you also recorded, narrated, you‚Äôve told stories out loud. How did those other creative expressions feed something that film didn‚Äôt?

**GRAHAM**  
They fed me like bread breaks a fast. When you narrate something‚Äîchildren‚Äôs stories, spoken word‚Äîyou can shape tone, pace, breathe. It‚Äôs more intimate. It‚Äôs not about the camera‚Äôs eye, or what others see‚Äîit‚Äôs what you tell. Those stories let me fill parts of myself that Hollywood sometimes left blank.

**FRANK**  
Did you ever feel complicit in the scarcity, in the systems that limited you? Or were you always fighting against them?

**GRAHAM**  
Yes and yes. Complicit sometimes by simply accepting a small role because bills must be paid, or because the script says, ‚ÄòThis is your part.‚Äô But always fighting. Small gestures‚Äîsaying no, demanding more respect, pushing for authenticity. Because representation matters. Not just faces, but the truths behind them.

**FRANK**  
Here‚Äôs a question: if you could give one thing to future Indigenous actors or artists, something you wish you‚Äôd had more of in your early career‚Äîwhat would it be?

**GRAHAM**  
Freedom. Freedom to fail in ways that aren‚Äôt fatal to one‚Äôs career. More creators producing for themselves. Support‚Äîfinancial, institutional‚Äîthat doesn‚Äôt require you to conform. And maybe the courage to tell the quiet stories. Because often the quiet ones are the ones that change people more deeply.

**FRANK**  
(quietly, emotionally)  
You‚Äôve changed many deeply. Your roles in *Dances With Wolves*, *The Green Mile*, in television‚Äîpeople saw themselves in you. They felt represented.

**GRAHAM**  
(smiles)  
That was always enough. If someone sees themselves‚Äînot as the ‚Äúother,‚Äù not as the stereotype‚Äîbut as human... then the work has been worth it.

**FRANK**  
Last thing‚Äîif you look beyond this room, past the curtains, past the green lights‚Ä¶ what hope do you carry?

**GRAHAM**  
Hope that stories continue. That barriers crumble. That young artists will be freer than I was. That scarcity becomes choice. That representation isn‚Äôt a patch, but a foundation. And that in the end, art isn‚Äôt just what you produce‚Äîit‚Äôs what you leave behind in people‚Äôs hearts.

**\[Beat. Soft lighting, the hum rises.]**  

**FRANK**  
Thank you, Graham. Thank you for showing up‚Äîeven now.

---  

**FRANK**  
Is this part of your story too?  

**GRAHAM**  
(somewhere between grave and amused)  
It‚Äôs everybody‚Äôs story. Don‚Äôt let them narrate it for you.  

Frank turns back to camera.

**FRANK**  
(to audience)  
Ladies and gentlemen‚Ä¶ and whatever else is listening‚Ä¶ scarcity, like hunger, can be engineered. But so can generosity. So can imagination. That‚Äôs what stories are for. That‚Äôs what artists like Graham Greene leave behind.

He looks to Graham. Graham nods once, then steps toward the crackle of green light. For a moment the studio lights frame him like a doorway.

**GRAHAM**  
(softly, to Frank)  
Keep telling them. Feed them the truth.

He steps through. The crackle closes without a sound. The sand settles back into audience chairs, where people now sit blinking, as if nothing happened.

Frank straightens his tie, faces the main camera.

**FRANK**  
Tonight we talked about artificial shortages, real hunger, and real hope. We were joined‚Äîare joined‚Äîby the stories Graham Greene gave us. Wherever he‚Äôs traveling now, may the path be full, not empty.

He gestures to the house band. They start a rhythm.

**FRANK**  
Until next time‚Ä¶ keep your eyes open, your plates full, and your stories yours. Goodnight.

The camera slowly dollies out as the studio set dissolves into a star-field, the band‚Äôs rhythm fading into the sound of wind over prairie grass, darling.

I was feeling good and thought I‚Äôd pop on my submariner rep for the journey. It was the perfect day, just a slight chill in the air. I made it into the cafe and opted for a maple latte. I obviously had to get a shot of the latte art with the sub in frame #forthegram. That's when I felt some eyes on me. I didn't quite pinpoint where it was but I figured I either drew some attention by taking a stupid picture of my coffee or I was just feeling self conscious. Whatever, I shrugged it off and went about the final leg of my weekend jaunt with a stroll back home through the park.

On the way out I got that same feeling though, someone was watching me. A little while later, I noticed a man approaching unnaturally from behind. I wasn't too far from home so I sped up a little. He sped up a little‚Ä¶ uh oh. I sped up a lot, he did the same. Before I could think of what to do I hear, ‚ÄúNice Watch‚Äù followed quickly by ‚Äúhand it over‚Äù.  Son of a bitch, it finally happened, I‚Äôm getting mugged. I could see the butt of a handgun sticking out of his hand from behind his hoodie pocket. I follow his directions and I hand it over. Rather than run off though, he starts inspecting it closely. I wonder if I should just get out of there but he's still got the gun pointed in my direction. 

He looks puzzled as he checks over the watch. He scratches his head and says ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù He pulls out a loupe! He inspects further and starts shaking his head, no no no this is all wrong. The magnification isn‚Äôt right, the cyclops isn't aligned, the rehaute isn‚Äôt even engraved and the machining on the bezel is atrocious. ‚ÄúNice Shitter.‚Äù He pulled out his gun and shot me in the knee, smart because then he wont get hit with attempted murder. He throws the watch back to me and runs away yelling ‚ÄúNext time at least buy VSF!‚Äù

I am in shock. I look down to inspect my leg and see how bad it is only to be surprised there is no blood and there is an airsoft bb on the ground. This motherfucker tried to steal my rep with a rep!

[A$1000],"I currently use a Compak K3 which was a hand-me-down. Its frustrating to dial and retention is terrible. Its also very bulky, a pain to clean, and more than I really need.

So, I started narrowing down, but the further into the rabbit hole I go I am unsure.

- DF64 (budget, seemed to tick most boxes)
- Niche Zero (conical burrs best for espresso?)
- Varia VS6 (flexibility with burrs, cheaper than Niche)

Obviously there are more pros and cons for each but those are kind of my sticking points.

Priorities are flavour, consistency, workflow, compactness and aesthetics (Niche, dont love the look), retention and ease of cleaning, and longevity. 

I make 2 coffees a day, espresso (strait) and milk-based.  I have some experience and do want to level up but am not connosuier level. 

Not super experienced with flavour profiles etc but pretty sure we don't love fruity/citrusy and would prefer body and richness.

1nfhvip,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1nfhvip/the_guest_at_her_light/,The guest at her light .,"You walked like sunlight on a clear day,
a laugh I had rehearsed in secret rooms.
I loved you like a hymn ‚Äî clumsy, fervent, proud ‚Äî
believing the world itself would bend to that light.
I saw us whole: morning coffee, unabashed promises,
small wars forgiven with kisses that tasted like summer.
For a while I thought God had finally been kind.

Then the day came, paper-sweet and terrible,
and the white dress I‚Äôd sewn from nights of dreaming
fit you better than any prayer fit me.
I smiled like a man who had a right to breathe,
until I realised my right had been a lie I‚Äôd told myself.
You moved forward with someone else; the room turned thin,
and every laugh I‚Äôd kept for us fell from my mouth like coins.

The ring on your finger glowed like ordinance ‚Äî
a cold, formal sentence. Your smile was not mercy; it was law.
Something in me, small and stubborn, refused to accept that verdict.
I drank to widen the silence, to fill the space your hand left empty.
Vodka burned the honesty from my throat and made me clever with pain;
I learned to name my wounds in drunk syllables, to worship them.

I am not a man redeemed, only a man made of excuses.
Sin sits in my ribs like an old coin, like a name I cannot spit out.
I have been rotten in ways I cannot confess without tasting bile,
and the guilty animals of my memory prowl, fierce and awake.
They tell me I deserved less than love, that my hunger was a crime;
they tell me to be grateful for punishment, to kneel and count my scars.


Tonight I want to shout ‚Äî to tear my skin and show you the map beneath,
the cartography of every fault that led me here.
I want to press my palms to my chest and find the last warm thing inside,
but my hands come away blank as I am.
So I sit, a guest at a feast of what I should have been,
and fold the future into the pocket of my shame.

This is the last resort of a foolish heart: to say goodbye in full.
Not a polite step back, but a reckoning ‚Äî take me with your eyes.
If I am damned, let the sentence be final: no pleading, no reprieve.
Keep your light. Keep the vows that were never mine to keep.
I will go into the small dark I have always cultivated,
not with a brave speech, but with the quiet theft of someone erased.

Forgive me ‚Äî not because I deserve it, but because I must say it:
I loved you until my love became its own punishment.
And if this is the last thing I leave behind, let it be plain:
I am tired of pretending I could be anything other than this.
This is the last goodbye ‚Äî take it, and close the door.

The door might be closed but the pain is stuck inside , 
a small crack on the frame makes me loose my mind  ,
Even when my mind is chasing you it‚Äôs strength has run out ,
So forgive me darling as i cant be the one you want .

* Taste notes with sliders (still not sure I understand what ‚Äúbody‚Äù means)
* Brew summaries that look like receipts (kinda fun)

# Learning side

* Logs beans, roaster, origin, processing (I had to Google ‚Äúanaerobic‚Äù)
* History + ratings so I can see if I‚Äôm actually improving
* Simple profile stats to keep track of total brews and patterns

* What mistakes do beginners usually make that an app could prevent?
* What am I probably doing wrong without even realizing it?

1nfhrhz,https://i.redd.it/r4u21mpyetof1.png,"""PSA: How AI Art Actually Works (For Those Still Convinced Their DeviantArt Sonic OCs Were 'Stolen')","Alright kids, gather 'round because apparently we need to have The Talk about how machine learning works, since half of Twitter seems to think there's a little digital goblin inside ChatGPT frantically copy-pasting from their 2009 anime fanart.

**Step 1: The ""Learning"" Part (Revolutionary Concept, I Know)**

So you know how you learned to draw by looking at thousands of pictures throughout your life? Crazy concept, but AI does something similar, except instead of your eyeballs, it's math. Lots and lots of math. The AI looks at millions of images and basically goes ""huh, noses tend to be in the middle of faces"" and ""wow, grass is usually green-ish."" It's not downloading and storing these images like some kind of digital hoarder - it's extracting patterns and relationships. Think of it like learning the ""grammar"" of visual art.

**Step 2: The Magic Math Sauce**

The AI creates what's essentially a multi-dimensional map of concepts. It learns that ""fluffy"" plus ""four legs"" plus ""good boy"" often equals something dog-shaped. It's not memorizing your specific drawing of Fluffy - it's learning the abstract concept of ""dog-ness."" The training data gets compressed into statistical weights that are about as similar to the original images as a recipe for chocolate cake is to the actual cake.

**Step 3: Generation (AKA The Part Where Your Art Isn't Being Copy-Pasted)**

When you type ""draw me a sunset,"" the AI doesn't rifle through its training images going ""aha! Here's Kevin's sunset from Instagram!"" Instead, it uses those learned patterns to generate something new. It's like if you asked someone who'd seen a thousand sunsets to paint one from memory - they're not copying any specific sunset, they're synthesizing their understanding of what sunsets generally look like.

**But Muh Copyright!**

Here's the thing that's apparently controversial: learning from something isn't the same as copying it. When art students study the masters, they're not committing copyright infringement by learning techniques from Picasso. When you learn to draw anime eyes by looking at manga, you're not stealing from every mangaka ever.

The AI isn't redistributing copyrighted works - it's doing what humans do, just faster and with more math. Your art contributed to its understanding of visual concepts the same way every sunset you've ever seen contributed to your understanding of what sunsets look like.

**""But It's Not Fair!""**

Look, I get it. Technology is scary and change sucks. But ""it learned from my publicly posted art without paying me"" is about as legally sound as demanding royalties from every art student who ever glanced at your work. The fair use doctrine exists for a reason, and transformative use has been a thing since before any of us were born.

**TL;DR:** AI art generation is pattern recognition and statistical interpolation, not a cosmic copy-paste conspiracy. Your art helped teach it about visual concepts, which is exactly what human artists have been doing to each other for literally thousands of years. The only difference is the AI doesn't need to buy expensive coffee while it learns.

*Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go generate some pictures of cats wearing tiny hats, because that's apparently what we've decided to do with this technology.*

  
EDIT: Yes, I know some of you will still insist this is theft. No, explaining how machine learning actually works won't change your mind. Yes, we can agree to disagree while I continue to enjoy my robot-generated cat pictures.

1nfhnzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nfhnzp/class_of_2000/,Class of 2000,"My teenage years were a mess. My mom and dad went through a bad divorce, and they were trying to figure out two brand new lives. I ended up somewhere in-between as I adjusted to an irregular schedule and sudden move. When my mom got full custody, I was in my last year of high school. We‚Äôd just moved a year prior, and now we were about to move again. Just six months from graduation we moved all the way to San Antonio. Quite the different vibe from a no-one-cares kinda town in Minnesota. So yeah, I graduated at the turn of the millennium. Class of 2000.

If I‚Äôm honest, I rarely think about that year when I lived in Minnesota. I mean, I remember it, but I‚Äôd be hard-pressed to tell you anything about it. I remember the high school, and how I thought it was weird they could afford a pool. I remember the Babin siblings being creeps. Or that one Christian girl who couldn‚Äôt stop talking about how she was ‚Äòsaving herself‚Äô for someone special. There was the guy who stayed in the computer hall all day, and the gym bro, and the guy who kept getting shoved into lockers. People called him ‚ÄòHandsome Man‚Äô as a cruel mockery.

I think my favorite was a guy named Hank. His dad was a plumber, and he was gonna be a plumber too. Hank was the kind of guy who liked collecting things. Weird things, like lost screws , pop tabs, or bottlecaps. He would categorize them by color or weight and keep them in little jars in his locker. The one time I saw it, he had like, 30 jars. All meticulously sorted.

That‚Äôs the one guy I guess I could call a friend from back then. He was gonna be a plumber, I was gonna be a veterinarian. I reached my goal, but I have no idea if Hank ever did.

¬†

I haven‚Äôt thought about those days in Tomskog High in a while. I‚Äôve had no reason to, really. That is, until not too long ago.

Nowadays, I live out in Kerrville. I got a wife, two kids, two cars, and a very pampered golden retriever. Being a veterinarian, we‚Äôve saved a lot on bills for that pup. My kids are about the same age that I was when things went to shit, but I‚Äôm glad to say that cycle is broken. I‚Äôm happily married. We‚Äôve had a few hiccups along the way, but it‚Äôs been more like ‚Äúsleep on the couch‚Äù kinda hiccups, not the ‚Äúget out of my life‚Äù kind.

In this kinda life, you don‚Äôt need to think back on your teenage years. You‚Äôre busy worrying about your kids‚Äô college applications and tuition. Or that weird sound you hear when you take a sudden right with your car, or why your favorite shirt is starting to feel too tight. My hair‚Äôs gone a little too thin, my eyes are a little darker, and I have a harder time staying awake during movie night. But that‚Äôs all just flavor, you know? It‚Äôs all just life. A whole bunch of little worries.

So when I had a couple strangers come knock on my door, I didn‚Äôt think much of it.

¬†

I was home alone on a Sunday. I‚Äôd just walked Kitten (yes, the dog is named Kitten) and was about to settle down for lunch when there was a knock at the door. A white van with the logo of a wrench, a cogwheel, and a couple of pipes. Very generic. I opened the door to see two men in orange coveralls and full toolbelts. They introduced themselves with a company name I didn‚Äôt recognize. They asked me about my name, and I confirmed my identity.

‚ÄúThe city is taking steps to minimize damage from flash flooding,‚Äù one of them explained. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing some groundwork, looking at possible runthrough. Since you live at the end of the block, chances are we‚Äôre gonna have to go all ‚Äòround your property.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what are we looking at?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTwo, maybe three months of roadwork a stone‚Äôs toss away from your bedroom window,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúUnless we can work something out and go straight through your backyard. Then we‚Äôre looking at a month, tops.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôd be entitled for some compensation then. And I‚Äôd have to talk to my wife about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, yeah,‚Äù he nodded. ‚ÄúCome along, I‚Äôll show you what we‚Äôre working with.‚Äù

¬†

I stepped out of the house, looking back at Kitten. He wasn‚Äôt happy about it. Tail between his legs and all. I closed the door and followed the men to the van. The moment they opened the side door, I was confused. There were no pipes, no tools, nothing. It was a blacked-out storage with soundproofed walls.

One of them pulled a hood over my head. The other tased me. It felt like they‚Äôd tied all my nerves to a single spot and were trying to rip them out of my skin. They must‚Äôve practiced this a hundred times, it was so fast. Just a couple of seconds, then I was face down in the back of a van with my legs and hands zip tied. One of them stayed in the back while the other sped off. A couple of streets later, they stopped. They did something to the side of the van, presumably changing or removing the logo, as well as changing the license plate.

Meanwhile, the guy in the back wrapped me up in some kind of plastic.

‚ÄúThe best thing you can do is be quiet and still,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúAre we gonna have a problem?‚Äù

I remember trying to ask a hundred questions at once. There was no reason this should happen to me. I wasn‚Äôt involved in anything sketchy, and we didn‚Äôt have millions stashed away in some looney tunes kinda safe in my wife‚Äôs home office. They hadn‚Äôt even checked my wallet for cash, they just took my cellphone. I finally managed to get a question out.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be honest,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI have no idea.‚Äù

¬†

We drove for a couple of hours. They sat me up and chained me to the wall. I was given some apple juice through a straw. For some reason, they treated me like I was dangerous. They would shy away from me whenever I moved. I could hear their tools rattling as if they were prepared to tase me if I said something they didn‚Äôt like.

You lose a sense of time when you‚Äôre wearing a bag over your head and your heart beats at 150mph. But eventually, they stopped the van. We were somewhere far out. The road had felt uneven, and I could hear birds chirping. A light shone through my bag as they opened one of the side doors and got into a heated conversation.

‚ÄúHow can this be the guy?‚Äù the driver said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not trying anything. We‚Äôve seen nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs on the list, it‚Äôs best not to question it.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what if we got it wrong? You saw what it took to dredge the fucking Melonhead out of the lake.‚Äù

That tickled something in my brain. I hadn‚Äôt heard that nickname in years. There was this one guy who used to stay in the gym a lot. He had a rounder kind of head than most people. Not, like, misshapen or anything. Just unusual by comparison. He liked the nickname though, he thought Melonhead meant he had a big brain. I could still imagine him doing lifts saying ¬†‚Äòmore‚Äô, ‚Äòmore‚Äô, ‚Äòmore‚Äô between each rep.

But that‚Äôs when it first hit me; they were talking about my class that one year back in Minnesota. This had something to do with my high school years.

‚ÄúI was only there for a couple of months,‚Äù I said out loud. ‚ÄúWe had to move.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

The guy in the back stepped back in and leaned down to me. I explained, at length, how my mother had moved to Minnesota on a whim, and how we‚Äôd left well before graduation.

‚ÄúSo you never got the shots? Nothing?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

I could hear hesitation in his voice. Someone had messed up, somewhere down the line. The two of them stepped away.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù the driver said. ‚ÄúWe can either be the ones who took some initiative and disobeyed a direct order, or we can do what we‚Äôre told.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre gonna stick him in the pods with those things?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wanna risk it? I mean, even if we‚Äôre right, do you wanna take the risk of showing them we‚Äôre willing to disobey an order?‚Äù

That shut down the conversation. Mistake or not, they weren‚Äôt about to turn back.

¬†

They drove all night. I was given some kind of fruit sauce from a tube as a meal. By morning, we‚Äôd pulled up to an industrial complex. I could hear the machinery and power tools going off as metal struck metal. There were people there too; dozens of them. The moment we stepped out of the van, someone bumped into us. It was clear that wherever we were, they were in on it.

I was led into a quieter room in the back and asked to step inside what felt like a locker. Rubber floor and walls, barely big enough for my shoulders to fit. They strapped me in, allowing me to effectively ‚Äúsit‚Äù in there, but there was just no way to get comfortable. Then they tipped the entire thing, making me feel like I was lying in a coffin. It was completely soundproof and dark. A voice came through from an internal speaker.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre releasing the straps in a moment,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúThen you can take off your hood. It‚Äôs gonna be a long ride, try to get some sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù

There was no answer. The straps came undone with a click, and I threw off my hood. It was pitch black. I barely knew if my eyes were open or not, blinking was just a reflex. The air was stale as a small fan spun somewhere around the top of my head. I could barely move, and I felt this heaviness in my chest. Like if I somehow drew too deep a breath, the air would run out, or my rib cage would bump against the lid. It was so disorienting.

I remember banging on what I thought was a door. I needed a light. A window. Something to orient myself around. But there was no response ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt even know if they were still out there. What would I do if I got left in there? What if they just walked away?

¬†

I tried telling myself it was going to be a long ride, but I had no idea. It wasn‚Äôt just a long ride; it was close to torture. I was flipped, stacked, pushed and, at one point, dropped in freefall. The pod cushioned all blows, and since I could barely move, I couldn‚Äôt really hurt myself from being in an unfortunate stance. It was clever, but man was it uncomfortable. I lost all sense of time there. It might have been a couple of hours, could have been a whole day. They had this little hatch on the side where they got me a bottle of water, or a tube of fruit sauce. I had two more meals, so I‚Äôm thinking it all took about a day. I know there was a flight involved though, my ears popped.

I was half-asleep the next time they used the speaker.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be opening the doors in ten seconds,‚Äù a strange voice said. ‚ÄúMake no sudden movements.‚Äù

I counted in my head, but I must‚Äôve gotten it wrong. I was only at five when the door popped open. Two masked men with bulletproof vests and assault rifles. A man in a white lab coat with a protective face mask. A white room with blinding fluorescent lights. They made me turn away and put restraints on as I was dragged to a chair and made to sit down. I felt so weak, like I‚Äôd been pulled out of bed at 3 in the morning. The man in the lab coat got down on one knee to face me.

‚ÄúWhere did you graduate?‚Äù

‚ÄúSouthwest.‚Äù

‚ÄúSan Antonio, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere were you before that?‚Äù

¬†

I explained the circumstances. My time in Tomskog, Minnesota. A couple of years in West Virginia. Before that, South Dakota. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôd spent most of my life. The man was very patient, allowing me to explain. I saw him making notes on a clipboard, doing checkmarks next to lines my eyes were too fuzzy to read.

‚ÄúChecks out,‚Äù he said as I finished. ‚ÄúYou were never part of the class long enough to get any booster shots or heat therapy.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, nothing like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo when you hear names like‚Ä¶ Digman. Babin. Bogan. That means nothing to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt rings a bell, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

I shrugged. I could hear the resignation in his voice as he got back up, giving the others a long look. The armed men shuffled about, looking at one another.

‚ÄúPut him in a room,‚Äù the doctor said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not part of the subject line; I‚Äôll sort it out. Go ahead and tell Ridge to prep for extraction.‚Äù

‚ÄúSir?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe man‚Äôs a fucking veterinarian, what the hell are we gonna use him for?!‚Äù the doctor snapped back. ‚ÄúYou that desperate to get your cat‚Äôs teeth cleaned?!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, sir.‚Äù

¬†

They led me through the facility. All corridors sort of looked the same, but they were brimming with people. You could hear all sorts of noises. I recognized one as a bone saw. We went past this one room where they had a pod like mine on a table, preparing for surgery.

I was escorted to a small room. Bright as all hell, but there was a dimmer switch. Sleek interior, like if Apple made a hotel room. Lights along the ridges of the furniture. A ceiling fan that could be heard but not seen. A TV built into the wall. A queen-sized bed, a couch, a bedside table with a water pitcher and a glass. A bathroom with a shower. A mini fridge with a couple of snacks and sodas. Honestly, I‚Äôd slept in worse places.

I took some time to decompress. I was still a prisoner, but at least they were hearing me out. I figured there‚Äôd been a mistake, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out exactly what. Maybe someone in that class had done something terrible, and everyone they‚Äôd been involved with was under scrutiny. But if so, why wait this long?

I couldn‚Äôt figure it out. But I counted my blessings; I was out of that damned pod. With a little luck, I might be able to get on a flight back home sooner rather than later. I couldn‚Äôt imagine how worried my family might be. Coming home to an empty house and an unlocked front door. They must‚Äôve called the police.

¬†

I managed to get the TV going. They had a couple of movies available, so I put something on just to not get drowned in my own thoughts. It was then that I realized just how high-strung I really was. I could feel my muscles relaxing and my heart slowing. I‚Äôd been on the verge of collapse all this time, and only now could I feel some semblance of recovery. I took a shower and changed into some fresh clothes; there was a wardrobe with generic slacks and t-shirts. I figured they wouldn‚Äôt mind.

I was halfway through a Bill Murray comedy when the door opened. A woman in a gray pantsuit was escorted inside by an armed guard. I was forced up against the wall on the opposite side of the room. They checked my pockets for weapons and had me sit on the bed. As he finished, the woman turned to him. I think she was in her mid-30‚Äôs. Had this short almost platinum blonde stubble of hair.

‚ÄúWe got it from here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou can wait outside.‚Äù

The man left. She sat down on the couch across from me, looking at the paused frame of the movie with a vacant smile.

‚ÄúI just think we ought to have a conversation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to interrupt your me-time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can talk,‚Äù I assured her. ‚ÄúTalk away.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a level of miscommunication,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mind telling me why I‚Äôm here? What you think you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù

She gave me a long look, tilting her head.

‚ÄúI want you to consider something,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThink about where you are. About who you might be talking to. Consider the lengths we‚Äôve gone to in order to get you here, into this room. Now, ask yourself this; is asking me a question like that *beneficial* to your current situation?‚Äù

I shook my head, staying quiet.

‚ÄúI would agree,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúSo maybe we should stick to *me* asking the questions.‚Äù

¬†

She went through a list of checkpoints, asking about my mental and physical health. She asked me about people I spent a lot of time with, about my children and spouse. It‚Äôs as if they were looking to see if anything stood out. She couldn‚Äôt find anything. She corroborated my accounts with what had been said previously, adding little checkmarks to a list.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she sighed. ‚ÄúIt appears you weren‚Äôt supposed to be on that list. I suppose an apology would be in order.‚Äù

She turned to me, putting away her notepad. She opened a shoulder bag, producing a set of papers and a pen.

‚ÄúThis has been an unfortunate misunderstanding, and we will be sure to rectify it. I think we can come to terms.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes this involve me being put in an unmarked grave?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing quite so dramatic,‚Äù she smiled. ‚ÄúThat would create a lot of questions. I think the best thing for both of us is to arrange a small cover story and compensate you handsomely for your time.‚Äù

¬†

I was given a contract with a firm called Hatchet Pharmaceuticals. This contract confirmed that I‚Äôd been consulting them on an important project. They spelled out a point list of items to be compensated for, like food, hotel rooms, overtime pay, all the bells and whistles. There were receipts. All in all, it was more than fair compensation. Just over 6 figures. A solid cover story.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very thorough,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe can assign a representative to explain the situation to your family.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôd be for the best,‚Äù I agreed. ‚ÄúAnd after this, we‚Äôre done. We walk away, correct?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect. I‚Äôll have you on a flight first thing in the morning.‚Äù

I had no further questions. I signed it.

‚ÄúI hope you see why we can‚Äôt let you roam the facility. You‚Äôll have to stay the night, but we‚Äôll do our best to accommodate you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. Just‚Ä¶ an early flight. The earliest.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

She got up, leaving a copy of the contract. As she left the room, I noticed the armed guard still waiting outside. She turned to me a final time.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you a root beer. I know you like them.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt say she was wrong. I suspect they‚Äôd taken a step back and examined what they knew about me a little closer.

¬†

For a couple of hours, I was comfortable. They got me a proper steak dinner and a root beer, and I ended up watching movies until I fell asleep. The lighting was pretty impressive; it started to dim on its own once it noticed me getting into bed. In that moment, I was positive about the whole thing. I‚Äôd been compensated, there would be an apology and explanation given to my family, and I could put it all behind me once and for all. Now I just had to wait for that early plane and hope for the best.

I didn‚Äôt have a clock or anything, but I must‚Äôve slept for about two hours when I noticed something. The buzz of the ceiling fan stopped, and the dimmed lights went completely black. I waved my arm a little to see if there was a sensor, but nothing happened. Getting up, I went to check the door. It must‚Äôve had some kind of magnetic lock, because I still couldn‚Äôt open it.

Then I did something. It‚Äôs hard to explain why. I heard this thumping noise, and I just had this feeling. Like, it‚Äôs one thing to hear footsteps, but this sounded *wrong*. I stepped aside and pressed myself up against the wall, facing away from the door. Seconds later, something stopped outside my room, and I hear this metallic groan.

¬†

The door was bent open, inch by inch. Mechanisms snapped and bent from immense pressure. Something was standing in the doorway. I heard this low rumble, like a snoring bull. Then a crack, followed by a loud chewing; like someone eating a fresh carrot.

‚Äú*‚Ä¶more.*‚Äù

The voice was more of a gargle. It sounded like it came from the chest of something rather than the mouth. I could smell this sharp tang of iron in the air as there was another snap. The intruder was dragging something along the ground, taking the occasional bite. Snap, chew. Snap, chew.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶more!‚Äù*

The lights in the hall were still out, so even though the door was open, I couldn‚Äôt see a thing. I held my breath and ducked down low as a large hand swept by just to my right. It was looking for the dimmer switch. When it realized it wasn‚Äôt working, it snorted and left the room; lumbering off down the hallway, dragging a snack along.

¬†

I used my hands to feel my way out the door. It was bent in the middle and barely clinging to its hinges. The lock mechanism was still there, but it was so busted that you could pull it out your bare fingers. I almost slipped in something as I reached the opposite wall. Something must have happened, and I‚Äôd be stupid to just sit and wait for it to blow over.

There was a hum. A short, low, hum. Some kind of backup generator came on, bathing the hallway in a red light. My eyes adjusted as I realized I was standing in a liquid that covered most of the hallway. It might have been red, it was impossible to tell. But given how it smelled, I‚Äôm pretty sure I was standing in a pool of blood. There were torn pieces of armor splattered on the walls, along with patches of skin clinging to the fabric.

I‚Äôd never seen anything like it. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hard to be afraid of something so violent. It‚Äôs one thing to see a strange man with a knife, that is scary. But to see a pile of corpses out in the open? I mean, yes, that‚Äôs scary, but it‚Äôs almost *too* scary. I remember watching that patch of skin slide down the wall, shaking my head, thinking that there was no point in trying to understand what had happened. There was no point in asking questions. I just had to get out of there.

¬†

I tried to backtrack through the hallways. There were these pipes on the walls in different colors and symbols, but I couldn‚Äôt make sense of them. They were most likely there to help guide people to various departments. There were arrows though, so I figured if I went the opposite way that should bring me back to the origin point, or maybe even the exit.

What had happened in my corridor was no isolated incident. There were signs of struggles all over. The room where they had prepped for surgery was covered in black goo and had a hand pressed against hardened glass. There was another room that, when you got close, your hearing stopped. Like when you get water in your ear, only deeper. I couldn‚Äôt even hear my heartbeat. I could feel it, but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hard to explain. It was as if something bad was waiting around every corner, and the further I got, the worse it felt.

My hearing eventually returned. It felt like coming up from a deep dive. I walked through a corridor where I could hear something eating in the next room. Something making bird noises. I did see a couple of living people, but they had these strange white masks on and didn‚Äôt seem to respond to anything. Absolutely everything had gone to *shit* in a matter of hours.

¬†

I heard voices up ahead. My first instinct was to run ahead and see what was going on, but I stopped myself. From what I‚Äôd seen so far, things weren‚Äôt that simple. I stayed by the corner, listening.

‚ÄúDoor. Locked.‚Äù

A second voice.

‚ÄúYes. Locked.‚Äù

A third person joins the conversation, wandering in from an adjoining corridor.

‚ÄúYou mask-faces happy just standing here?‚Äù

A man‚Äôs voice. He had a strange intonation, like he couldn‚Äôt help but to roll his R‚Äôs and end his sentences in a gulping noise. It reminded me of one of the kids I went to high school with, Roy. He had this speech impediment, like a stutter. He‚Äôd stop it by swallowing hard and shaking his head like a tic. It was such a specific noise, it was hard to pinpoint with a description.

But that‚Äôs where it hit me. Roy. Melonhead. These were old Minnesota classmates. They‚Äôd brought in me on suspicion of being part of this class. Chances were that these same people had been brought in as well. That may very well *be* Roy on the other side of the hallway. But if that was the case, what did that mean? Was all this chaos perpetrated by my old classmates?

If so, what the hell happened to them?

¬†

Making my way to the main corridor, I ran across a series of gruesome sights. There was a man covered head to toe in some kind of black acid, melting him into bone. There were several patrols of people with white masks, speaking to each other like grunting cavemen. I stopped counting dead bodies after 20, instead trying to keep my eyes on the marks on the wall.

I eventually got to a lobby of sorts. Two massive storm doors had gone down, blocking the exit. There‚Äôd been a massacre. At least eight, maybe ten people, all crushed against the door. They‚Äôd tried to get out but got caught on the wrong side. The red lights on the wall span round and round, making the shadows livelier than the remains that cast them.

I heard someone approaching and escaped into a side room. There was a couch, a drink machine, a microwave, and a fridge. Clearly some kind of lunchroom. The red light didn‚Äôt reach all the way in, casting a long strand of red peeking through the half-closed door. I hurried inside and pressed myself up against the wall. It didn‚Äôt take me long to realize I wasn‚Äôt alone. Someone was hiding behind the couch.

‚ÄúYou need to leave,‚Äù a voice whispered. ‚ÄúI have a gun.‚Äù

I shook my head and put a finger on my lips to shush them. I could hear someone approaching from outside.

‚ÄúYou need to leave *right now*,‚Äù they insisted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking. This is *my* spot.‚Äù

I shook my head again. If they fired a weapon, this place would be crawling with things in a matter of seconds. They‚Äôd doom us both.

Problem was, something was already coming our way.

¬†

The door creaked a little.

I could see the shadow of two long legs as something bent down to enter. It‚Äôs impossible to describe the scale of this thing, it was at least‚Ä¶ 10, maybe 11 feet tall. Like an elongated person. A slick black jelly-like skin rippling with chunks. As it moved, I could spot patches of white poking out at different angles. Bones. Like someone had deconstructed a person and jammed it into a walking puddle.

There was hesitation. Whoever was hiding in there with me decided to shut the hell up. A long arm reached out, touching the side of the drink machine. It was such a casual movement, but it was forceful enough to knock the whole thing onto the floor with a bang. A couple of cans rattled out of it. The tall thing poked around a little, making one of the cans burst from the pressure. That seemed to amuse it. It pulled on a pop tab, seemingly frustrated.

I could hear something in the distance. Like a whirr, getting louder and louder. Then a series of mechanical clicking, and a spark.

The lights were coming back on.

¬†

The red gave way to harsh fluorescent light as I saw this thing in full and clear view. It was barely keeping itself together; it was like if someone was trying to hold old Jell-O with a two-pronged fork. It was looking at the person hiding behind the couch. They weren‚Äôt as well hidden as they thought they were. It only took me a brief glance to realize it was the woman with the gray pantsuit that‚Äôd talked to me earlier. As the thing saw her, she pulled out her gun.

I covered my ears and sunk to the floor. There was gunfire and screaming. The creature had a hand big enough to cover her face and used it to push the back of her head into the ground. It must have had some kind of suction force to it, as the body stuck to it. The screams came and went in a flash; there really was no fanfare to it. Just a quick snap, and then nothing.

By the time I looked up, the thing was already looking at more interesting items around the room. It seemed particularly curious about the soda cans. That it was holding a whole corpse seemed more like an inconvenience. But as it turned to leave, it spotted me.

¬†

There was a moment of silence as it looked at me, as if trying to understand what it was seeing. A single soda can rolled across the floor, touching my foot. I looked at it, then up at the creature. Why was it so interested? What was the deal?

I picked up the can, popped it open, and held it up.

‚ÄúIs this it?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou want me to open it?‚Äù

It tilted its head. It wasn‚Äôt convinced. It reached out, carefully, poking the pop tab. I pulled it off, presenting it.

‚ÄúThis?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou want this?‚Äù

An oil-slick hand reached for it, accidentally grazing my finger. The skin on my index finger turned a sickly orange as my nail darkened. I could feel a deep ache, as if my nerve was hardening. My finger curled in on itself as it picked up the pop tab. It held it up, looking at it from different angles. I only knew of one person who collected things like that. I pointed at a nearby table.

‚ÄúThere are‚Ä¶ cups,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou can put it in a cup. Collect them. Put them all together again. All the same, just like you want it to.‚Äù

The thing turned its head. At least I think it did. It was hard to see that it was looking one way or another at all. I don‚Äôt even think it had eyes to begin with.

¬†

As it turned its attention to the other soda cans and the empty coffee cups, I reached for what remained of the lady in gray. Half of her was still hanging out of that thing, dangling like a broken doll. There was a twitch to the leg, like there was something inside trying to get her to run. Like an operator calling out on a line where no one‚Äôs listening. She was still holding something in her hand, barely visible through the black sludge.

I bent her hand open. It made a snapping noise as a tendon protested ‚Äì revealing a keycard. I pulled it loose, only for the sludge thing to turn my way. It did not appreciate this intrusion. With one step, it closed the distance. It reached for me with its free hand. I had to do something, or I‚Äôd be next.

‚ÄúHank!‚Äù I called out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Hank, right?‚Äù

The hand slowed, dropping to the floor. The ceramic tiles turned a sickly blue, fizzling. I could see something just beneath the surface of the sludge; a cranium. There really was some kind of head under there, and it was looking my way.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ collect things,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou arrange them in jars. You had them in your locker.‚Äù

It stared at me as something bubbled beneath its surface. Bones moving up and down, rearranging themselves.

‚ÄúIs that what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúAre you collecting now?‚Äù

It bobbed its head.

‚ÄúIf we go outside, you can collect so many more things,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut then we gotta open the door.‚Äù

It bobbed its head again and stepped back, leaving room for me to leave. I did.

¬†

The main lobby was filled with‚Ä¶ various things. People in masks. Something large, chewing on an arm. I think I saw the Babin siblings in there, but I can‚Äôt say for sure. The large thing in the back stepped forward the moment it saw me, pointing with its whole arm. There was no doubt in my mind that I knew this person. Melonhead. His facial features looked a bit exaggerated from when I‚Äôd last seen him, and he was a whole lot taller, but it was him. I barely recognized him as human now, having an almost grayish skin and dark eyes. I could see him salivating as he dropped a bloodless limb to the floor, advancing towards me in a jog.

The sludge thing came up from behind, swinging an arm in a wide arc. It smacked Melonhead over the jaw, sending him reeling back, scratching at his face. The sludge thing was making sure I made it to the door. I could feel the weight of inhuman eyes staring me down. I hurried up to a control panel on the wall, swiping the access card.

‚ÄúStep one authorization complete,‚Äù said an automated system. ‚ÄúPlease present your hand for biometric confirmation.‚Äù

I swallowed hard as Hank dropped an acid-burned arm next to me. It was surprisingly heavy. I held it up to the panel, manually adjusting the fingers. My stomach churned. It felt like playing with raw chicken.

‚ÄúPlease hold‚Äù, the system asked as a task bar reached a hundred percent.

Then, green lights. The storm doors started rolling.

¬†

Some of them ran. Some of them screamed with joy. A couple didn‚Äôt say a thing. A couple of people with white masks kept guns at the ready, scanning the area for threats. Melonhead lumbered outside looking for his next snack. And finally, the sludge. He put the coffee cup down, realizing there wouldn‚Äôt be any more pop tabs around for a while. He wandered off without looking back, stretching out to the point where he rivaled the treetops.

By the time the lobby was empty, I stepped outside. Some of them had run into the woods. A couple of them had moved down a westbound path towards the barracks. There was a pine forest ahead, so I guessed I was somewhere in the Midwest or north. The birds sounded familiar somehow.

‚ÄúNot much of a reunion, buddy.‚Äù

That strange voice again, with the rolling R‚Äôs. The gulping. I didn‚Äôt need to turn around to know I was talking to one of the Babin siblings. I turned to face him; a pale man with slick hair combed back. A hawk-like nose and these chemically wide eyes. He leaned against the open storm door in a parody of casualness.

‚ÄúI recognize you, you know,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúClass of 2000.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúTomskog High.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you move?‚Äù he asked.

This is when I noticed he had a knife. He was picking his nails with it.

‚ÄúI did. San Antonio.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo bad,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe had a lot of fun after graduation.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can imagine.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you can,‚Äù he grinned. ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt.‚Äù

He gave me a pat on the shoulder as he passed me by, trying to catch up to his sister. His head bent forward, his steps like that of a prowling cassowary.

¬†

I managed to get to a highway. From there, I got in touch with the police. From there it was a series of phone calls, a booked plane, and a tearful reunion with my family. I didn‚Äôt know what to say to them. Was I still bound by that contract? Was there anyone left in that facility to reimburse me? I had no idea. I stuck to the story as well as I could.

I did get a check in the mail not long after. Printed on cheap paper with a stamped blue sunflower logo. It came with a notice that I would only be getting one payment. They were shutting down that branch of the organization for an ‚Äúemergency restructuring‚Äù. I guess Hatchet Pharmaceuticals is getting shuttered. I couldn‚Äôt care less, if I‚Äôm honest. I got paid, and I got out.

I had to go through surgery to get my finger fixed. The acid burn was bad, and they described the damage as my index finger trying to pull into itself. Had to walk around with a cast for weeks.

¬†

I know this all seems too fantastic to be true. A lot of things are. I could write a full book on any one of those corridors, but looking back now, it all feels like a distant dream. It was so unreal that it felt like it happened to someone else. And it‚Äôs not what I saw that haunts me the most, it‚Äôs what I felt. A pulse beating out of my chest, not knowing if the next beat will be my last. Stepping around the corner, praying that no one heard me struggling to breathe. That feeling comes back every now and then. I can be standing in my bedroom, looking at the door, and I just get this sense that there is someone waiting on the other side. There isn‚Äôt, but that doesn‚Äôt stop me from thinking there is.

I have not been contacted about the class of 2000 since. I have not heard the name of Tomskog High mentioned. There have been no e-mails, no texts, no strange visits. No white vans pulling up in my driveway, telling me lies.

And I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a good thing.

Something tells me ‚Äì it isn‚Äôt.",16,1757718044.0,nosleep,0,0.95,False

37 year old , 8 weeks pregnant here. Just looking for some words of wisdom as I am struggling bad now.

I was a caffeine addict before getting pregnant. About 500mg average probably per day. Once I found out,  I went cold turkey on energy drinks and cut down to 200mg a day. 2 cups of coffee.

I have been absolutely miserable. Im not sure if its morning sickness or partly withdrawal.  Im tired of every second of every day.  And also feel constantly sick everyday. I think caffeine is maybe making me sicker,  but I am on the struggle bus staying awake every day.

I have an important job. Im a supervisor and im the only one that can do my job, so i need to be focused. We're busy at work and I have to work at 530.

Any words of wisdom? Im only 8 weeks and im miserable.  Should I cut out caffeine? I've never had this nausea before with pregnancy, but its been 10 years since my last kid lol. I sleep as much as I can and eat ao much to try to get energy.  ",2,1757718038.0,decaf,3,1.0,False

He has prescribed me daily antibiotics for almost 5 years now for my acne and whenever I ask if there is any danger to being on antibiotics daily for so long, he says no, people are usually healthier than normal while on them. I have gone back and forth between 4 pills of amoxicillin a day at 500 mg, or 4 pills of cephalexin a day at 500 mg. He also additionally started prescribing me spironolactone ~a year and a half ago. 
Now I'm sure that my chest pains are also (and probably more so) because I have had covid a couple times, used to vape, and have smoked marijuana for years. I have also taken 60 mg vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) for the last 10 years daily, and before that, other adhd meds since 7th grade. I also drink coffee, but on average only about a cup to a cup and a half a day. Could the antibiotics also be making things worse? Or would it most likely be long covid and the other risk factors?
