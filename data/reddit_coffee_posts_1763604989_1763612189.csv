1p1tjyv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1tjyv,"First impressions on 25 fragrances, including Essential Parfums, Mind Games, BeauFort London, Xerjoff and Maison Crivelli","Received some discovery sets and loose samples today, here are my unwanted first impressions on all 25 fragrances.

**Essential Parfums**

• *Bois Impérial* - Fresh and woody scent in the air, very clean and with a small metallic tinge. Much more metallic up close but it's not that strong on paper so I'll have to try this on skin. I'm usually not a fan of metallic notes but they're done perfectly here, and if Ganymede is anything like this I'll probably like that as well. Pretty nice. 8/10

• *Bois Impérial Extrait* - Similar to the non extrait in the air but darker and spicier perhaps. Definitely not as fresh, this is more woody and spicy and it also has a rubbery smell to it. I'll try layering both together, I feel like that's the intent with the two versions. I do like it though but a bit less. 7.5/10

Both versions of Bois Impérial start resembling each other a lot after 10-15 minutes.

• *Divine Vanille* - Vanilla and cinnamon in the air. A lot of tonka up close, it's also a bit floral and ambery. Nice and inoffensive vanilla scent, completely unisex. It kind of smells like a middle ground between Althaïr and Herod to my nose. 7/10

• *Fig Infusion* - Green fig scent in the air. Very citrusy, the orange blossom is also prominent. It smells good but I'm not a fan of bright green scents like this. I see it's compared to scents like Thé Matcha 26 and Gris Charnel but it doesn't smell like either of them. I like it less as it dries down, it smells like bell peppers. 5/10

• *Mon Vetiver* - Very citrusy in the air, it almost smells barbershoppy in style. The vetiver is smooth here, this smells very clean, like you just walked out of the shower. Very nice. 8/10

• *Néroli Botanica* - Neroli and orange blossom in the air but not the smoothest I've smelled. Similar in style to Reflection Man in my opinion, but this accentuates the white florals more, they're slightly sharp here. Smells good but nothing groundbreaking. 7/10

• *Nice Bergamote* - Nice bergamot indeed, some jasmine supporting it, the ylang-ylang takes a bit longer to show itself. I don't suppose this lasts that long. 8/10

• *Orange X Santal* - Woody and mossy bitter orange, emphasis on the bitter to my nose. Some areas of my gym smell like this so it's throwing me off a bit. It also reminds me of Vodka on the Rocks in some ways. 8/10

• *Patchouli Mania* - Earthy and damp patchouli in the air à la Straight to Heaven but better. The cacao and hazelnut smell fantastic up close, I didn't expect this to be gourmand-ish or smell so good. Looking forward to trying this out more. 9/10

• *Rose Magnetic* - It does smell like rose in the air but for some reason it smells champagne/cider-like. Clean rose scent with a bit of grapefruit up close. I don't get any vanilla here. 7.5/10

• *The Musc* - A light and honeyed lavender scent in the air. Very clean and inoffensive, yet it's among my favorites of the bunch. 8.5/10

• *Velvet Iris* - I pick up a lot of galbanum in the air. Iris with a soft leather, this smells extremely similar to Italian Leather from Memo, it just replaces tomato leaf with galbanum, making it less harsh to the nose in my opinion. I'm a big fan of this DNA so this shoots up there with my favorites as well. 8.5/10

Not the most consistent discovery set I've tried in terms of liking all the scents to similar amounts, but the standouts are definitive standouts, I don't discard the idea of buying a few of these scents in their travel spray sizes. I do have to give credit to these fragrances for smelling as high quality as they do for the price, these are some of the best fragrances I've smelled value-wise.

**Mind Games**

• *En Prise* - Baccarat/OFG/Haltane/T&C musk in the air. Some ginger and citruses up close. Smells alright. 6/10

• *French Defense* - Sweet and powdery cherry in the air completely unlike any other cherry scent I've smelled. Ambery and floral, the cherry is an inch away from being syrupy. Not a fan of cherry scents but I rɛally appreciate this for smelling so different to the usual cherry fragrance. 7/10

• *Gambit* - Aromatic and spicy in the air, very fougère-like. Definitely in a similar vein to Fierce/Percival but leans much more blue to my nose. Reminds me a lot of Vodka on the Rocks but it's not airy at all like the Kilian. I like it but I would never pay Mind Games prices for a scent like this. 8/10

• *Lionora* - Kind of generic fruity-white florals scent. No note in particular stands out to me, it's well blended. 6/10

• *Queening* - Smells like marshmallow with a bit of coconut in the air. A bit of orris up close, this kinda smells like cotton candy. This is an awesome scent but it does lean feminine for sure. 9/10

• *Ruy Lopez* - Peppery patchouli in the air. Woody, green and definitely a bit boozy and with a bit of cherry. Smells much better than I expected, I'm looking forward to trying this out more. 8.5/10

• *Sans Voir* - Aquatic and musky grapefruit in the air. Light and airy but in a gross way, 99% sure this uses calone. I don't like it much because of that. 5/10

• *Sissa* - Sweet tonka bean and vanilla in the air, ever so slightly lactonic. A bit floral and soft spicy up close from the jasmine and sesame. Very good but also leans feminine like Queening. 9/10

• *The Forward* - Salty citruses with a bit of vanilla and pomelo. I like this a lot, very fresh and clean, perfect beachside scent. 8.5/10

• *Vieri* - Green, citrusy and musky in the air, the tea and lemongrass go very well together. It has a slightly acidic touch but very well done, it's not overly acidic like Fiero from the Casamorati line. 8/10

I tried the Artisan Collection discovery set a few months ago and this was more of a mixed bag compared to that set. I'm a bit disappointed by the fact the best fragrances from the set (Queening and Sissa) lean as feminine as they do, I don't see myself pulling them off. 

**BeauFort London Sirenide** - Soft, sweet and floral in the air, a hint of a leather note à la Eau d'Ombré Leather surprisingly. Musky in an animalic way up close but not too animalic and it keeps reminding me of that Tom Ford, but it's almost like this is a ""feminized"" version of it. This also has a slight syrupy sweetness that makes me think of soda. It starts smelling a bit like baby wipes and it somehow starts getting excessively sweet, it becomes nauseating. It's one of the safer scents from BeauFort along with Acrasia and Absent Presence but it's nowhere near as good as these two. 5/10

**Xerjoff Louis XV 1722** - Fizzy grapefruit in the air but it smells refined and mature, it makes me think of Himalaya from Creed. Very musky and with an airy booziness compared to the usual rum or cognac note but I can also pick up hints of coffee and a creamy lavender. I like this a lot. 8.5/10

**Maison Crivelli Safran Secret** - Spicy and woody scent in the air but also with something slightly sweet and creamy behind it similar to Pardon from Nasomatto. Obviously a lot of saffron up close but with a metallic tinge that smells quite interesting. As it dries it starts smelling like Memo's Palais Bourbon's dry down to my nose, by which point I don't think it smells as nice anymore. 7/10",1,1763611801.0,Colognes,0,0.99,False

I did not pay attention to efficient packing before, but I think I started to enjoy the benefits of doing so, anyways, here we go, I wanted to share my interesting (what I thought) setup.

Due to my trips personal/business nature, I needed a smaller size laptop bag. So I actually packed the Kuro workpack into Basecamp. I traveled with both of them separately before. Basecamp for a weekish, and Kuro for couplish days. I love the basecamp's versatility with its divider, and it is somewhat formal looks (it can stand on its own). And Kuro, even though there was not many reviews, I really got into the built-in pouch (it comes with a pouch bag too!). And in this stacked format, I was able to fit medium and small size peak design cubes into Kuro (with its pouch bag in). I still had room for coffee equipment and a bag of fruits! I forgot take a seperate picture of the Kuro, but it is actually places right in the first picture. I think is a very underrated and not well known bag. I also think Basecamp Voyager is just the perfect combination of formal and travel style. Love them equally.

We were walking out of our exam and she wanted to go get coffee. I said yes because I do enjoy my time with her and it’s rare that she asks me to hang out. She began talking on the phone and I was waiting around. I said we can go and I’ll drive so you can focus on your phone call. Then a girl comes up to her and she starts talking to her for 25 mjnutes, at this point we can’t even go get coffee because she has class in 20 minutes. I had no class after and was gonna go home if I wasn’t planning to hangout with her. I tell her I’m gonna go wait outside and I was assuming we were just going to sit and chill in the car or something like we sometimes do. She then walks past me not acknowledging me at all and hangs out with the other girl she was talking to. I was upset and tired in the moment and kind of hurt because I waited for an hour just for that and not even a goodbye just walked past me laughing. I texted her this and this is how she responded. I will admit I came off rash but I am starting to think this is not someone who cares for my friendship and only does when there’s no one else around. ",1,1763611355.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

Nandinio: Salutations to you all. I welcome you to today's news program. Hello, Kavjao.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Kavjao: Saluton, Nandinio. Hodiaŭ, miriga raporto estis legita de mi. La ekzistanta opinio, ke trinkado de kafo damaĝas la korritmon, estis rifutita de la unua hazarde elektita klinika provo.  
  
Kavjao: Hello, Nandinio. Today, an astonishing report was read by me. The existing opinion that the consumption of coffee causes harm to the heart's rhythm was refuted by the first randomized clinical trial.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Nandinio: Ho, vere mirige. Forta kredo estis frakasita de la scienco. Ankaŭ alia scienca raporto estis aŭdita de mi. Estis malkovrite de sciencistoj, ke profundaj tertremaj faŭltoj resaniĝas per si mem ene de nur kelkaj horoj. Estis dirite, ke ilia resaniĝa procezo funkcias kiel rapide fiksiĝanta gluo.  
  
Nandinio: Oh, truly astonishing. A strong belief was shattered by science. Another scientific report was also heard by me. It was discovered by scientists that deep earthquake faults are healed by themselves within just a few hours. It was said that their healing process acts like a quick-setting glue.

'En-inteste-brilanta pilolo' estis desegnita de sciencistoj, per kiu kolonoskopio povus fariĝi nedeviga. Por identigi sangadon en la digesta vojo, mikroskopaj hidrogelaj sferoj, plenigitaj per sang-detektantaj bakterioj, estis kreitaj.  
  
Kavjao: Nature's self-healing power is indeed wonderful. Now, a similar, man-made solution has also been known.

Nandinio: Such a medical invention is truly for the welfare of humanity. Another prehistoric report was read by me. For the first time, from the permafrost-preserved tissue of a 40,000-year-old mammoth, astonishingly intact RNA and hidden genetic secrets were discovered by researchers.

We are the development team behind Pixelle-Video.

The video above is a quick demo of our latest open-source project: Pixelle-Video.

The concept is simple: We realized that while generating images in ComfyUI is great, turning those assets into a final, watchable video involves a lot of tedious manual editing. So, we built an engine to automate the whole production chain.

How it works: You simply input a topic (e.g., ""Why does coffee make me tired?""), and the engine automatically:

✍️ Writes the Script: Uses an LLM to generate the storyboard and narration.

🎨 Generates Visuals: Calls ComfyUI under the hood. Crucially, it supports custom workflows, so you can use Nano banana2、Sora、Flux、Wan、Qwen, or your own specific node setups to control the style.

🗣️ Adds Audio: Synthesizes TTS voiceover and auto-aligns background music.

🎬 Assembles: Handles the final layout, subtitles, and rendering instantly.

It is designed to be a ""Prompt-to-Video"" pipeline that respects the flexibility of ComfyUI.

She usually teases me about being a “boy scout” but never made a big deal until now.

Last week I was at the grocery store on a Saturday morning doing our weekly shop. There’s this woman ahead of me in line, maybe early 40s, with a full cart but she’s on the phone looking stressed. I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop but the store was quiet and she was talking kind of loud basically telling someone (sounded like a friend of some

Sort ) that her husband got laid off Friday, they have two kids, the mortgage is due soon, and she was putting stuff back because she could only afford essentials this week. She was holding back tears, counting out cash for milk, bread, eggs, that kind of thing. Total came to like $48.

When she stepped away to take another call, I just… told the cashier to add her stuff to my bill and I’d pay for it. Didn’t say anything to the woman, didn’t want to embarrass her. Just paid and started loading my own bags. She came back, cashier gave her the receipt saying it was taken care of, she looked confused then around the store, saw me, and I just gave a small nod and left quickly.

Got home, told Sarah what happened because I thought it was a nice moment. She got quiet then said it was actually creepy that I listened to a stranger’s private conversation and then “inserted myself” into her life without asking. She said the lady probably felt watched and pitied, and that doing anonymous nice things is fine but this crossed into making someone feel small on purpose. Said real charity doesn’t need an audience, even if the audience is just me knowing.

Now she’s been distant all week and keeps bringing it up, saying it makes her question how I see people  like projects instead of humans. I genuinely didn’t mean it that way; I just hate seeing someone struggle and I could help without making it a thing. But now I’m second guessing if I actually humiliated that woman or violated her privacy somehow.

We’ve been friends since high school, we’re now in our 30’s and have always had a close relationship. About a year ago we got into a heated discussion & didn’t speak for a year. Wellll, I gave in and reached out to him, I genuinely missed him. He responded and we had a conversation all day UNTIL he brought up what we fought about the previous year. We decided we weren’t going to be friends (again) but after talking to my girlfriends I realized that I had feelings for him and that’s why I was so quick to be harsh on him. It’s weird and immature ik. So a week later I sent him a honest text. What are your thoughts on his response? I admitted to having feelings for him but he didn’t say anything relating to that. I don’t feel much emotion to his message and am wondering is he’s just being nice. 

Me: “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve been being very stubborn and prideful. Truth be told, I have feelings for you but I’ve been blind to my own feelings regarding you. If you’re ever open to grabbing coffee or something, let’s meet. No more texting please, I feel like there’s miscommunication on my end.” 

Him: “No need to apologize. You're not stubborn or prideful. I think only thing you got to remember is I'm not saying or doing things to prove anything to you. Or neither do you have to interpret that deep or read into everything so much. 
But with that being said, I agree. Texting might cause some confusion. But I'm also tired or misinterpreting things, so we can meet up in person. Except I want to give it some time.

Nandini: Salutations to you all. I welcome you to today's news program. Hello, Kavya.

Kavya: Hello, Nandini. Today, an astonishing report was read by me. The existing opinion that the consumption of coffee causes harm to the heart's rhythm was refuted by the first randomized clinical trial.

Nandini: Oh, truly astonishing. A strong belief was shattered by science. Another scientific report was also heard by me. It was discovered by scientists that deep earthquake faults are healed by themselves within just a few hours. It was said that their healing process acts like a quick-setting glue.

Kavya: Nature's self-healing power is indeed wonderful. Now, a similar, man-made solution has also been known. A 'glow-in-the-gut pill' was designed by scientists, by which a colonoscopy could become optional. To identify bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, microscopic hydrogel spheres filled with blood-detecting bacteria were created.

Nandini: Such a medical invention is truly for the welfare of humanity. Another prehistoric report was read by me. For the first time, from the permafrost-preserved tissue of a 40,000-year-old mammoth, astonishingly intact RNA and hidden genetic secrets were discovered by researchers.

1p1taf4,https://i.redd.it/ymdz5gq05c2g1.jpeg,Beans.,"It was December 19th when it all happened. When everything was ruined. It’s been years since then, but I can still remember everything. I remember the day the world changed. 

The day started out normal. My alarm went off at 7am and after checking my phone and lazing in bed, I forced myself to get up. I brushed my teeth and hair, used the bathroom, and went downstairs to make coffee. 

While the coffee was brewing, I went outside to grab the paper. I opened the door, stepped out, and slipped on something. I hit the ground hard. It wasn’t hard enough to knock me out, but I was left in a daze, wondering what happened. It was then that I felt something slimy and sticky under my hands. Lifting them up, I realized they were covered in baked beans. My blood ran cold.

Baked beans have been illegal for years; our Goddess made it so. The possession of baked beans was instant death by beheading and even though I wasn’t the one who put the baked beans on my porch, I knew I’d get blamed for it anyway.

I had to get cleaned up right away. Slowly, I stood up. My head throbbed and my ears were ringing, but I managed to get up. When I looked up, I almost fainted. 

Right ahead of me, there were baked beans everywhere; they covered the street, the sidewalk, cars, plants, trees, and people. I saw people running around in a panic and as they ran, they were slipping right into…something. I couldn’t really see what it was from where I was on my porch, so I stepped off of my porch a little and saw that it was a grinder machine of some kind. People were slipping into it and being ground up into pieces. I could hear the horrifying sound of their bones, flesh, and muscle being crushed up by the machine. I could hear them scream in pain as they went through the machine, followed by their heads exploding and then silence. 

For a while, I didn’t move. Couldn’t move. I just watched in horror as this happened. I wondered why this was happening. How was this happening? What caused this? When I looked around more, I saw our Goddess in the sky, a giant can of baked beans in her hand that she was currently dumping out. She was doing this to us. She was spilling the beans and killing us.

I was filled with anger, dread, fear, so many emotions at once; all too much to handle as I fell to my knees and sobbed. Screamed until my throat hurt. Said “why” over and over again as our Goddess laughed and continued to spill the beans. I heard women, children, and men screaming in horror. I heard the sound of the meat grinder. I heard bodies being chopped up and spit out.

It was the end of the world and there was nothing that could be done to stop it.





AN: yeah this is a beans story I wrote because of a text I sent my friend after she asked if she could spill the beans 💀 text included. I think it’s kinda shit but whatever, it’s a story about baked beans and gore LOL

I also fucking hate beans.

Chapter 1, black and yellow stripes ￼

The road was a dark emptiness broken up by yellow stripes. Despite having my hands on the wheel, they kept slipping from the leather. I continue to blink. I let off the wheel because I was numb, and I struck something. I hit a deer that appeared to have died, splattering its brain on the rear of my vehicle. The realtor turned right and struck a tree after the corpse struck the back of the car. And there were no more pine needles or blood; instead, I smelt coffee breath, opened my eyes, and beheld a woman dressed entirely in white. She was a nurse, but she looked similar to someone.￼She picked up some gum, put it in her mouth, and began to chew it.
I was unable to speak because of the object blocking my mouth. When I looked at her, she seemed surprised when her eyes met mine. My mother and my younger brother were there when she left. When my brother was on the phone, there was a lot of joy and tears. It was probably Pops. He was narrating. They took hold of my arm and kept saying, ""Karolis, you're actually okay."" They won't go. For hours, they remained by my side, joy and a trace of sympathy in their eyes. I feel like a shattered pot that someone just threw in front of the museum, like an object in the room.

I've got several cuts, a fractured arm, and haven't slept deeply in a month. Dr Bugs Bunny was usually grinning and had large teeth. He simply mentions things concerning my condition, such as that I probably have brain damage and that part of my memories will or have already vanished. He is so hollow and lifeless. He claims that everything will be alright, but that's just big, cheap teeth. After a while, I returned home and stated that I probably needed some help before I could potentially put my life back together. It's ￼ jarring ￼that one of the regulations prohibits drinking.
I feel numb, yet everyone around me seems relieved that I'm okay. I feel like I'm about to collapse every time I stand up. The same NSAID is the only medication that has helped me with my discomfort over the first few weeks. I simply feel empty, but there's one thing that has been affecting me the most. What on earth is Meškaemnu?

Chapter 2: the host of the most ￼

I saw him while flipping through the channels on the TV. I switched to Channel 3, which frequently features travel, late chat show hosts, history, and kid-friendly programming. When the kids' shows started airing, they were usually merely dubbed cartoons, but there was an original show called The Star Planet. This happy star with a spaceship soaring beneath it served as the logo. Being so endearing. The star rotates, getting smaller and smaller until it vanishes in the spacecraft as it takes off. Where there are several paintings of children with a large, towering black figure with yellow eyes, 
""I'm scared of clowns"" was the title of episode 645. 
The following scene displays the masses of kids and adults who can be seen clapping, grinning, and laughing with delight as the camera gradually steadies and descends. It gradually depicts the stage, similar to one of those sound stages, but inside this tastefully decorated living room with lovely couches, a TV with antennas, wallpaper featuring stars, a lava lamp, a huge globe, and a desk filled with various items, with several couches and the desk in the centre of the space. A man is dubbing this and shouting, ""Welcome to Star Planet,"" throughout. You are my oldest friend from another globe, and you are the host with the most during my travels today. I'm Meškaemnu. The audience erupts in applause and whistling.
He stood eight feet tall and had thick black fur all over him. He looks around, claps, and stands erect. His mouth was hidden by all the fur. His beautiful golden eyes were the only thing still visible. In retrospect, I never once drank during the entire episode. Was amiable despite having a heavy voice. He resembled Bigfoot in certain ways, yet for some reason, he appeared to be from another planet. After the applause, he finally spoke. Hi there. It is a privilege for me to be your host today. He began discussing his evening, claiming that he and his landlord had a heated disagreement and that he wished she to choke him to death. Everyone laughed uncontrollably, even though it wasn't actually a joke. He will undoubtedly begin discussing the episode's subject, clowns, stating that he was afraid of them when he first arrived on Earth and that fear is rather common. The camera pans up to his face as he says this. His eyes were merely orange, red, and yellow rings. It continues to move like droplets on water. Transforming into intense red and orange hues.

A group of clowns emerged, laughing, making jokes, and hurling objects. He was standing there joking around with the clowns when one of them grabbed his arms, laughed, and positioned him in the centre like a priest. He was holding Meškaemn with bloodshot eyes and an open mouth that was dripping saliva down his beard. Oh, I'm scared of that open laughing. At first, I believed that there was something like ""what we do in the dark,"" but I'm not sure anymore. ""Boys and girls, you understand that things like this are unnecessary fear,"" he said as he entered the show. As you become older, you'll realise that there are more significant things to be afraid of. His bright eyes appear to be pissing all over the screen, as if they are spinning and rotating into his iris. Zoom out. ""Have a good evening, boys and girls,"" it adds. Remember that the star planet is always your home. The star and the rocket ship returned after everyone applauded and departed as it began to rise. Boys and gals, have a great evening.

Chapter 3: Dr Nicholas is a rabbit. ￼

I asked my dad when he entered the room. Unfortunately, you missed it, but I believe there was a humorous show. He asked me which program after glancing at me. He gave me the biggest ""Huh?"" look when I said ""Star Planet."" ""Yeah, I know, right?"" I said. You don't know which Star Planet show you loved as a child with your favourite host, according to my dad. ""Meškaemnu"" is our friendly visitor. ""Are you joking?"" I asked, glancing at him. When my mother heard this, she became furious and said, ""Oh, the doctor's right.""

After we were silent for a bit, my dad finally said, ""I think your mother is talking about the chance of you forgetting things after you know what."" I believe that the STAR planet is one of the things you forgot. ""Are you pulling my leg?"" I asked him. After taking a deep breath, my dad said. Meškaemnu, a superstar presenter, actor, celebrity, pop culture icon, and scientist, has been the host of Star Planet for six decades. He is renowned for being the first and only star visitor to remain on Earth. I let go of my jar because I didn't trust what he said. I resembled my mother, who appeared out of the kitchen.
""Do you believe this shit?"" I asked my mother. Yes, it's common knowledge, according to my mother, and I get it. You find it hard to accept this, but your father is correct. When we were younger, your father and I saw this. Your grandmother actually witnessed the first show when he emerged from his spacecraft to shake hands and greet John F. Kennedy. Actually, I purchased The History of Meškaemnu last week. When I looked at the book, all I saw was a picture of him smoking cigars with a group of guys who appeared to be from the 1960s.
Go through the pages first. I've seen all of these images; I've seen this thing in movies, TV shows, and other media, and I simply can't believe it. My mother yelled at my brother to bring his stuffed animal. Observe my brother clutching a large, fluffy stuffed animal with large yellow eyes. I brought this, but why? ""Sally, we found the first thing he forgot: Meškaemnu,"" my mother stated. ""At least it's not like personal memories,"" my brother retorted. That they overlooked him is unfortunate. So scared, say ""no, no, no."" I doubt that I was unaware of this before today. My father said, ""All right, all right, you're freaking out,"" as he read the room. We must introduce this to him gradually.
Then everything simply returned to normal, as if my perceptions of the universe had not been destroyed by this random alien fuzzball existence. After dropping it, I fell asleep. 

Chapter 4: 1960 bears ￼
At first, I had trouble falling asleep since those eyes were ingrained in my memory, and every time I closed my eyes, I could still see them.
I asked my mother for the book when I woke up. She looked at me for a long time, as if to ask, ""Are you sure?"" because he freaked out yesterday. I have to say it again: I'll be alright. For me, it was simply a severe case of shell shock. Just the fact that, of all things, I recall everything but this. After my dad and brother left for work and school, I basically read all day. In order to give me some alone time, my mother was simply taking care of the garage. The majority of the time when I'm working on something, except yesterday when I was watching TV. Everyone remained loyal to me. It's good that they are by themselves, yet I would be upset.

In 1959, people in Lithuania, which was still under Russian rule, reported seeing a bright blue object during the course of December. This is when the moniker ""blue star"" first appeared. The UFO eventually touched down in the Klaipėda woodlands on New Year's Day. Meškaemnu told the men sent by the Russian government to investigate it that he had come from the star planet to study how to help humans. He appears to have developed a close friendship with the head of the Russian government during the months of 1960. and requesting that he represent Russia in a meeting with the United States. It was during this time that my mother mentioned that he shook hands with JFK. He rose to prominence as a symbol of independence from the USSR following his feat. Provide photos of him shaking hands with the revolutionaries from Lithuania. He launched the Star Planet program during this time to teach lessons, science, history, and anything else he felt like teaching the kids of Europe. Star Planet is this location for you; it frequently tells kids that there is always a house up in the sky in case they lose their own. He simply appears the same in photos from the 1960s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.

Chapter 5: Moon Landing was ￼ fake ￼

The only thing I've gathered from the entire situation is that, despite our planet's best efforts to appear human, there is a problem. He began doing radio in 1962, and it appears that the following year he launched his program, Star Planet. It just states that he assisted the space program in launching the first rocket to the moon in 1963, but I now realise that it was actually July 20, 1969, in his history class. I hurried up to my room, pulling my history book from the previous year, and I was right.
My dad, who had just returned from work, told me that the first lunar landing occurred in 1963. He responds, ""Yeah, it says 1963,"" when I show him the book. I draw attention to the fact that his star reading the book is merely uttering odd phrases like ""star planet program"" and ""Meškaemnu."" For whatever reason, he is a Russian national in this book, and he was assisting their Americans. He said, ""Actually, I'm not sure,"" while making a face like, ""Oh yeah, you're right."" He scratched his head and went to the living room, where I entered after a while. He's watching the Star Planet channel. He glanced at me.
The episode was about the space program; the topic was the misinterpretation of the 1963 
The first moon landing, which was mistaken for the 1969 moon landing was the first landing ￼. My dad looked at me and said, ""That's our answer."" I looked back at the textbook and saw that it was still saying 1969 was the moon landing. It could’ve tricked me or just accept everyone around me believing this and I wanted not to be the odd one out, but the Meškaemnu book that mentioned 1963 said June, but on the TV he was saying July. This thing is listening to my conversations, and when I looked at the TV, everyone in the room was silent. 
Meškaemnu He cleared his throat, stared at the TV, and simply resumed the show while looking at the side of the room. As everyone began to converse, the noise returned. Either this creature is listening to me and understands that I don't want to see what he wants me to see, or I'm going insane. I have no idea what the hell this thing is, to be honest.

Chapter 6: Apollo Applejacks is better than faucet flakes ￼?￼

My mom has been dragging me to the grocery store for a short while to get some fresh air because I've been on my legs more for weeks due to the battery. When I go to the cereal boxes section, I see his face on cereals called Apollo Apple Jacks, Galactic Goodberry Charms and 3POreos. This stuff prevents me from being at peace. All I want are frosted flakes. After I acquired the package, my younger brother led me to the toy section, where action figures, dolls, and soft toys were all over the shelf. I find it repulsive to watch a young child press her cheeks against his face.
I can't accept that this is the norm, even though everyone has been trying it as frequently as, say, muesli on the shelf. I've long been afraid of the thing I saw on TV. No one cares. I'm going through a difficult time, so maybe it's true that Star Planet was the only thing I forgot. It may be the case, but I'm not going to allow it to occur. Maybe two weeks ago, it was just one of those things that happened, and people went crazy over it because of minor things that happened one after the other and they were unable to explain it. It's really difficult for me to accept.
After everything, all I want is to feel normal again. In the centre of a crowded Meškaemnu sector now is the stuff there I closed my eyes when I saw it and ￼, this moment. As I was taking a deep breath and straightening my hair, my brother Jonas was giggling and pointing out a wild man who was stumbling. Earlier, I witnessed a man removing the plush Meškaemnu from the girl's hands and telling her, ""He's not always been your friend; you need to believe me, kid."" Even though that freak has only been here for a month, it feels like fifty years. I squeeze my eyes and recognise it as our older cousin Polo. ""Oh shit, it's Polo laughing,"" my brother said, chuckling. My mother's hands were on her face when I saw her. But the large people with the axe came around, snatched him up, flung him at the store, and banned him. At one point, our town's older cousin Polo rose to prominence as a radio host. He used to host some well-known performers, but he got into a rabbit hole, and I believe he's gone a little insane. My mother told me that every year, he gets worse and worse. ""Hey, it's funny,"" my brother says with a smile. ""At least you're not that crazy,"" he says as he approaches me and punches my arm.
I've usually kept myself to myself, especially with old Cuz. I'm breathing and recognising that this is the first time in my life that I need to visit him. 
 
Chapter  7: My cousin Polo is a radio host ￼

When I went to sleep, I didn't believe he came to see me. The ancient flowers that died on the hospital bed were from home, according to my dad, who said he had been there once. I made the decision to let my mother know that I was going to see some friends. He takes an Uber to his wooded home. His home was pleasant. It belonged to our grandmother. Together with his business partner, he constructed it and turned it into a radio station.

Speaking of her, she was standing in front of the door when she smiled and said, ""It's your Karolis."" I was informed about the mishap. Are you alright? After shaving my head and entering the very tidy space, I heard him wander around and ask, ""Is that guy again?"" To be honest, I'm quite convinced he's some sort of man in black or something. He is large and wears Dexter spectacles, yet he doesn't look the part. I said, ""Oh, hi,"" as he entered the room and glanced at me while brushing his shirt. It was a lengthy, awkward silence, I believe.

I sometimes question whether I am closer to Anya than I am to my own relatives. ""Listen, that night I said no, and I know how things were,"" he says, breaking the stillness. ""Hey, I'm not here for that,"" I said, stopping him. In addition, I have no idea what you discussed. ""Really, what are you here for?"" he asked, making a frown and glancing at her. I made the face because I knew I was going to say the craziest thing to the craziest guy I've ever met. I also told him everything about Meškaemnu, my dad, the book, and the TV. ""Cousin, you finally realise the truth,"" he remarked, glancing at me. I just witnessed Anya slapping him across the back of the skull. She made a face, and he gave me another glance in a tone that was far less arrogant. ""Yes, I do believe you."" At last, I challenged him, ""What do you mean when you say it's only been a month?"" ""Oh, you saw me in the supermarket saying that,"" he replied, glancing at me. ""What are you talking about?"" she enquired. ""Oh, it's nothing,"" he says right away. He finally responded to me by coughing up the tea he was drinking.

He doesn't appear to have been in his 60s or last year. Off his back. Anya brought up an enormous, extremely old radio, turned it on, and began to talk. It was one of those radios where you have to precisely adjust the frequency to obtain the appropriate station. I grew up watching a television program about Meškaemnu and his buddies doing good deeds all over the world. I recall owning toys and mugs, as well as witnessing a live play, yet everything that belonged to him would either vanish or be destroyed, or I would have a tale about how I lost it.

The conversation was taken up by my cousin. He drew out a cup and said, ""I remember the cans, the food, and the restaurants; for some reason, they disappeared and the only things we have in this room."" This arrived last month. What are we trying to communicate, her and me? I was answering, stammering, refusing. Every item in everyone's home that Meškaemnu purchased within the past month is meaningless. However, she continued the chat. We Lithuanians have a long tradition of upholding our right to free expression. It was difficult for us to maintain this in 1991.
One of the things the Russians want to prevent us from doing is expressing our ideas because they are unhappy that we are attempting to become an independent nation. The Vilnius TV Tower is to be shut down. In other words, the ruins are kept safe as a protest against the Russians. For us to maintain that station, seventeen people died. My father was a radio host, while my mother worked as a news reporter. During this time, my parents and many ￼ thought that if they kept equipment like this for a longer period of time, they would at least have something to fall back on in case the new technology was lost or destroyed.
Polo turned to face me and explained, ""The point she's trying to make is that we have this very old radio that actually picks up TV signals."" ""I noticed something,"" she replied, referring to the book. I was shown it by her. She picked up this device and looked at it, which surprised me. We hear it when she eventually hits the frequency. Some voice repeating meaningless words, some random noise that simply repeats itself loudly and softly, and something like electricity zapping. I shook my head and grinned awkwardly, saying, ""Yeah."" 

Chapter 8:￼Lithuanian ￼revolutionaries' baby

Last month, the signal appeared. The things we remembered were nonexistent until last month, when they began to show up at our homes. Meškaemnu, you don't recall anything about the accident you had last month. How does he appear? Do you think of him as a huge Black Lagoon creature or as a large crab man? How does it appear to you? Honestly, I never imagined that she would be the most insane person in the room. ""What the hell is she talking about?"" I asked, glancing at Polo. I'm afraid of the sea, cousin. That's why I find it fascinating that there are theories that Megalodon is still alive today.
When I look at the TV show seeing ￼ that freak talking to children holding their shoulders, I see him as a massive creature with an open heart pumping out blood, something out of H.P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Over Innsmouth, kind of like the bastard with bright eyes. I looked at Anya. She said in a much, tone as soon as a scarecrow ￼ holes that have eyes ￼. Polo looked at me and said, 'Is it a bear for you?' I choked up, and I said, 'Yeah.' Anya, I've been looking at the signal where it comes from. It's in Lithuania, in the woods next to the city to the north ￼.￼
Anya and I wanted to go into the woods. To be honest, I don't think it's an extraterrestrial or anything; rather, I believe it has to do with the government. ""I don't know; I just personally don't like anything about this,"" Anya stated while gripping her neck and staring out the window. We have a chance to put an end to it. ""Can I join?"" She said. It's better than two people going up there, according to Anya, but my cousin remarked, ""Listen, I really feel guilty about what happened before your accident.""
What on earth are you discussing? On the evening of the accident, you called and asked me to accompany you to a pub. I won't take you there, and I'm pleading with you to simply return home. It won't help if you go that route. ""Really, what the fuck are you saying, cousin?"" I said, grabbing his shirt. Before I could do anything or he could say anything, I almost lost my equilibrium while doing that. The radio simply vanished after exploding with noises and digging into my ear. ""What are you saying?"" I asked him gravely while lying on the ground and rowing myself up to him.

As I stared into his blue eyes, I could still hear screaming and scratching sounds coming from the radio, which seemed to be oscillating. For example, when an object descends a wave, you don't hear anything, and when you move up to catch air in the breeze, you may hear water dropping. Anya reached for something to slam against the radio, and it stopped. When I stop ringing later, I say it again, and Polo says it's gone. What has vanished? I can't remember anything about it; it must be that thing.
Upon returning home, I experienced the same sense of emptiness. Many questions regarding what's in the woods have been answered, but there are now too many to count. Describe Meškaemnu. Can we alter the recent events and what transpired before the accident?
I haven't gotten much sleep in the last few days. I'd prefer not to. 

Chapter ￼9:￼ ￼  Meškaemnu ￼ chips ?￼

When the day finally arrived, I was in the backseat when my cousin picked me up in the morning. Naturally, the food they were attempting to bring was chips with Meškaemnu taste. The bottles were telling me, ""Hey, it's tasty,"" as I glanced at them. Anya was unhappy about smashing her grandmother's old radio yesterday, but Polo just kept saying, ""Hey, I'll pay for it."" Before the storm's eye, everything about the drive was informal and typical.

The smell of artificial Meškaemnu-flavored chips filled the little area as the automobile rattled over the rutted dirt track. I gazed out the window at the dark green trees that made up the increasingly dense Klaipėda forests. With her knuckles ￼ white on the wheel, Anya sat rigidly in the driver's seat. With an uneasy vibe emanating from him, Polo continued to stare back at Karolis from the passenger seat. At last, Polo murmured, ""You're quiet, cousin,"" his voice too loud in the little car. Kept their eyes fixed on the woods. ""Look, Karolis, I,"" Polo shifted. What I heard on the radio last night is unknown to me. It's all Now it's all fuzz. All I can say is that you would tell me to pick you up and drop you off at another pub because you were upset and intoxicated. It's okay since I stopped him at that point because I didn't want to do it. There is a five-year gap between us. As adults, I don't recall us being very fond of one another, but do you recall the time we messed up the bath and your mum and mine became upset with us? Yes, he laughed. You were in tears. ""Well, you were stuttering and you were talking too much,"" I reply. You talk so much that they eventually stop caring because you are so obnoxious.
In response, Polo said, ""They called us dirty bears."" We chuckled over it. The dirt route eventually came to an end, and we spent about an hour in the woods on foot. Even though I didn't have very good shoes, we managed to ascend the hill and discover the Star Mountain, which was marked with an image of a happy star. We shook it off and went up, and there it was. Looking down the hill, we saw the road that we had walked on an hour ago, parallel to the road of the accident. The old flag logo with the green form and the Russian hammer and sickle was used by a TV station called Star Productions TV Waves in Russian.
Machine parts are run on the walls by cables, wires, and televisions. Oddly enough, there were some open boxes of Apollo Apple Jacks cereal and posters from the period of ancient Lithuania before independence. When we came in. Anya, Polo, and I headed to the basement via the stairs at the rear of the room. Somewhere, like in a missile silo, there were metal stairs. It was a very, very long way down; all we could see was the darkness at the bottom. However, this is why TVs resembled Christmas trees, much like chandeliers. It flipped as it descended into the hole.

Chapter 10: My Blue and Dirty ￼Bear￼ 

""Hello, dirty bears,"" Meškaemnu said when he was on television. Greetings from the star planet. Keep descending. The signs were yellow when I looked at them. Boys and girls, he went on to say. I'm glad you came. The Voice reverberates, clearly not speaking over the radio waves of the TV. ""I'll be quiet,"" Polo yells. Nobody wants to put you in a jar to marinade herring. You have fish guts. ""Yeah, that wasn't creative,"" he replied when I turned to face him. Meškaemnu I thought it was humorous, so I started laughing. He claps as the TV zooms out of him. It indicates we should absolutely give you a radio spot or TV show.

I apologise; I meant a successful radio program. ""Oh, Anya, my poor little blue bear, what does he realise?"" he says, clearing his mouth. When does he recognise that the blue bear has to be a little warmer with someone? Seven years have passed. Unlike your grandmother, would he realise in time to sell her farmhouse? You must come to terms with it, my blue bear. I was perplexed until I realised he was speaking with Anya alone. He returned to a game show and said, ""Ding ding ding, he gets it right,"" as the screen changed from blue to brilliant orange. Bear, you're quite intelligent. 
At least for humans. Your human brains are so easily damaged, like glass – perfectly, decidedly slick and nice to hold, but one wrong move, one drop, boom, it's broken. And sometimes it doesn't need to be a physical event to happen for it. If I'm right, my neighbour Karolis stopped. I looked at him. What? Never mind. The point is you guys don't keep them very safe; in fact, you don't have the genetic adaptation to have a layer of ""zingpophp"" to protect that thing. And sometimes you let poison damage your brain; you guys pick up ideas from old folks who don't know the landscape of the future.

Sometimes you believe that a system works because it always has, without considering whether we should or could change it, since you were born into it and will die with it. And some of your beliefs are based on anti-conduct, in which they dislike each other because of their varied colours and head shapes. What's the point? Anya muffled it. My thesis is simple: your revolutionaries are unneutered, your people are too tired to fight, and your order generations refuse to recognise the truth of the new age in warnings, papers, and metals found on meteors - they are more essential than the fact of your DNA on this planet.
And people will believe lies in case they give them a bit more space in the place. They have eight hours to stay in of nothing, replacing goodwill with objects of nothingness. For some reason, at the same time when someone on this planet has less than anything, they're grateful. Your system is structured to help the people of now twist to become individual gains. One point: becoming comrades will be successful for me to be successful. Your species are like mountains: different edges, different peaks, different valleys. You're all individuals. I started stepping down and said, 'So, who are you then, Meškaemnu?' And why do you care? 
￼Individualism has destroyed your species, but trueness remains. Non-changing. I despise being forced to change to survive among my own people. We need to evolve, but Star Planet is the place I created. Our imagination has burned into your head, and you choose the one that will allow you to embrace me. This is a critical step. What was the point of you changing into other things? He reacts with an Animal Channel-style graphics adaptation. My own people evolved to become the thing that scared the prey. Showing a goo changing into several animals. So, you blob.

Chapter 11: brains and skeletons ￼

Remember the next question you're going to ask. Karolis has already explained why I am Meškaemnu. Do you communicate specifically with your cousin Polo? I'm experiencing the same problem. And, no, I'm not a New Mexico extraterrestrial that fell here by accident; I'm a conqueror from the North Star. The first step is to be your friend; then, you will all become me. We ultimately landed on the ground, where we noticed a large number of individuals on the concrete floor heading towards the hallway door. They weren't dead, but everything had vanished except their brain. Attached to the cable. Skeletons are breathing, I'm done with the nonsense, so let's go to the circus.
I could not walk at first, but I can now. After a month of dealing with this garbage, I open the door. The enormous fluffy bear was sitting on a chair, watching television. Polo and his blue bear were in the back of me. He was quite happy now, pretending to munch some popcorn; they were simply tumbling down. He stared at me and yelled, ""Come in."" You want to know about the circus? He's still laughing, anticipating my next question. I adore 1960s films; you know, the cheesy, stupid, primordial stuff. That is the best thing you people have ever created: films and shows with meaning and imagery.
But for drama, I couldn't let your cousin tell you that you are missing memories. How about the audience? He snapped his finger and pointed to the television, where my brother and parents were watching Twin Peaks. What exactly does the word'shall' mean? It's good since they explained everything. No, it's good because it's full of mystery, but now that I've reached the finish, I can tell you. What is the point? Could you just wipe my memories? You could simply murder me. Why do this? It's fun. Isn't that the meaning of life? It's only fun when it's not fun. You simply let go of the wheel and expect to crash into something to kill yourself.
You didn't know, my stinking bear, because you forgot. I remember it because I arrived just in time to capture the memory for you. Why do you think I resemble a bear? You're not really fearful of them with her; she's afraid of scarecrows because she grew up on a farm while her parents were too busy, and your cousin is afraid of the water. A giant fish eating them seems reasonable in the context of this vast blue globe. He snapped his finger as the television showed me screaming.

Chapter 12: blizzard and bear ￼

In the car, the television showed me crying, drinking, and screaming while saying 'why'. It depicts it from every angle, and he says that you were in a relationship with this woman before the accident. I believe she was a girl from somewhere who came to start a new life. You became a pair. You were pleased, but certain troubles arose, and it was clear that you were different, but you still wanted to love her, You were exhausted over and over again, and when she invited you to go camping with some friends, you declined.
Polo said, ""shut the fuck up ￼' He went on, 'The reason why is because your cousin called you to go out drinking.' The television continues to play while I drive. I looked at Polo. What happens next? He continues to bless you, and you missed the news. At one camp, your hopper died in a blizzard, and some ￼ bits caught were gone ￼ inside a bear's stomach ￼. They shot that bear ￼ the next day. When he indicated that the TV would show the crash of me hitting the deer, I fell to my knees, crushed ￼ by everything. Myers' ring became nothing.
Lilly used to refer to you as ""bear""; very ironic in terms of fitness. When he stated it, it was in my head. I was being shaken by Polo. His eyes were blazing crimson, twisting and twisting like a spiral. I am no longer able to feel anything. You can see why I must take this action. The radio waves on your planet fluctuate; it is not a straight line. Nothing will change, so I wanted to remain motionless and silent. You can be numb eternally with us in Star Planet; you don't have to feel fine one day and terrible the next. I took hold of it. I took a TV and bashed ￼ his brains into the floor.

Chapter 13: eyes and pills ￼

She was deserving of better. She didn't deserve to pass away by herself in the bitter cold. She was lifeless, like a woman in the white of the snow, so I don't suppose he said it was all people, but to be honest, that didn't really matter. In my imagination, she vanished. I'm not sure which ought should have remained motionless. Either unaware of or aware of what I did. When the brains came out, it didn't help. They brought me back home, but it doesn't mean this place is the same; I still feel the agony. My thoughts have not altered. I've visited Star Planet. When I first entered, I wasn't lost, but now I am.
I didn't intend for this to happen. I had no idea that discovering the truth would bring me to this point. Meškaemnu take me to the location of the lost world of stars. I was never aware of the solution. Did he erase my memories so he could control me and merge with me more easily? Or did I turn down a gift that Lady Fate herself gave me? Throughout the night of my hospital stay, Polo has been clutching my hands because he felt too bad to look me in the eyes.
I am not upset with him. I am upset with myself. I keep seeing him in my room's corridor with heavy luggage. Anya. Both my body and my mind hurt. I believe that taking all of the pills at once will not alleviate the pain; it may for me, but not for my family. I remember him, but no one else does. The thing has died. Nothing penalised me since it was fun. Honestly, I earned it. I chose the moment, the mountain, and I didn't want to leave straight away. Even if I get lost in the winter, I can see his eyes in the North Star. I know who Meškaemnu Yesterday there was a new episode of Star Planet",1,1763610935.0,Wholesomenosleep,0,1.0,False
1p1t94c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p1t94c/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_be_intimate_with_my/,AITAH for not wanting to be intimate with my husband?,"Sorry, this is going to be long.

I (F26) have been with my husband (M26) for five years, married for 2. When we first got together, I had a pretty standard libido. Once we moved in together, my libido dropped significantly. We went from seeing each other/being intimate once a week to him asking for sex or oral daily, and it became a chore to me, honestly.

On top of this, I started a stressful job around the same time we moved in AND I’ve just recently come to the conclusion that the Zoloft I was put on around that same time to help with my anxiety (I’ve been on stuff for anxiety on and off forever and have always been on meds for depression) was affecting my libido—I recently stopped it and already my libido is returning some. (In addition, I have sexual trauma I’m still dealing with, which he is aware of and supportive of, which I’m sure compounded on everything else.)

But here’s where the issue comes in. He is not good at hiding his emotions. He has ADHD and we both strongly suspect undiagnosed ASD, and if he’s upset, it shows on his face. He generally does a good job of not being upset that I very rarely initiate anything sexual, but I still give him oral probably once every week or two and we have sex probably about as often. He always offers to return the oral, but I decline almost every time due to not being in the mood.

Also—when I say I give him oral, I’m not, like, super disengaged about it. I’m sure he KNOWS I don’t really particularly want to be doing it, but I feel like I act reasonably enthusiastic or at least don’t act begrudging—which I’ll admit isn’t how I should act, but it’s the best I can muster up.

He’s broken down a few times and told me how hard it is for him, that he doesn’t want to feel like he’s pressuring me but it makes him feel unloved and undesirable, etc. He asks for more non-sexual intimacy—but to him, non-sexual intimacy could just as easily involve a little groping as it could a regular hug, and the main issue is that I don’t want to lead him on that I’m in the mood when I’m not. His feelings and requests are valid, and I’ll admit that I am TAH for not working harder on non-sexual intimacy. On the flip side, I’ve asked him for more flirting/teasing to get me in the mood—but he’s just not very good at it, and thinks that touching me is going to magically get me in the mood. It’s not. It’s uncomfortable to me to have those nerves stimulated in a pleasurable way when I’m not expecting or wanting it.

Also—I didn’t realize this until a few months ago, since he started leaving for work before me, but I’ve realized he doesn’t brush his teeth in the morning. (The toothpaste tube doesn’t move positions from where I’d left it. I’m not springing a trap, but I have started setting it at slightly odd angles on the counter that I know he’d change if he used the toothpaste, but it never moves an inch. I’ve even told him that’s the main way I know he doesn’t brush—honestly, it wouldn’t be that hard for him to trick me by just nudging the tube, but it stays exactly where it was.)

He’s otherwise excellent about hygiene—and he DOES brush his teeth every night without fail—but not in the morning. He says he uses mouthwash instead, but I’m skeptical about that. I don’t normally use mouthwash, and the bottle never seems like it’s any emptier. He also hasn’t been to the dentist for as long as I’ve known him, and I keep trying to nudge him towards it—even this weekend I was like ‘hey, I’m looking to change dentists, want me to see if they take your insurance, too?’ sort of thing—but he says he doesn’t like the dentist and keeps putting it off. His teeth visibly need a cleaning, but aren’t in bad shape.

His breath isn’t atrocious, but I do sometimes get a whiff of morning breath when he’s talking. Combine it with the iced coffee breath he sometimes has and I have a very hard time not showing how disgusted I am when I smell it. We have talked about him brushing his teeth several times, and he gets upset each time and feels like I’m attacking him. He says it’s an ADHD thing.

I’ve asked him what would help—the toothbrushes are already left out, the toothpaste tube is left out, so there are visual cues. I offered to pre-load some toothpaste onto the brush before I go to bed so it’s ready in the morning, which I don’t WANT to have to do, but I will. He didn’t like that idea. His original excuse was that he doesn’t want to brush his teeth if he’s just going to eat breakfast when he gets to work and warms up a Jimmy Dean sandwich, so I offered to get him some of those disposable travel toothbrush things or get him a toothbrush to take to work. He said no.

The last time we discussed it, I was very blunt. I promised I wouldn’t bring it up again because I don’t want him to feel like I’m nagging him, but I told him that his lack of oral hygiene contributes to me not wanting to be intimate with him. Any time he kisses me—or puts his mouth anywhere on my body—all I can think about is that he probably hasn’t brushed his teeth today and the thought of his morning-breath saliva on me gives me the ick, which may be a little OCD of me, I’ll admit, but I feel like I’ve offered encouragement and solutions to him.

Sorry this is so long, and I know it covers a lot, but sometimes I feel like I’m TAH for not wanting to have sex. AITAH for not wanting to be intimate with my husband?",1,1763610909.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1, black and yellow stripes ￼

The road was a dark emptiness broken up by yellow stripes. Despite having my hands on the wheel, they kept slipping from the leather. I continue to blink. I let off the wheel because I was numb, and I struck something. I hit a deer that appeared to have died, splattering its brain on the rear of my vehicle. The realtor turned right and struck a tree after the corpse struck the back of the car. And there were no more pine needles or blood; instead, I smelt coffee breath, opened my eyes, and beheld a woman dressed entirely in white. She was a nurse, but she looked similar to someone.￼She picked up some gum, put it in her mouth, and began to chew it.
I was unable to speak because of the object blocking my mouth. When I looked at her, she seemed surprised when her eyes met mine. My mother and my younger brother were there when she left. When my brother was on the phone, there was a lot of joy and tears. It was probably Pops. He was narrating. They took hold of my arm and kept saying, ""Karolis, you're actually okay."" They won't go. For hours, they remained by my side, joy and a trace of sympathy in their eyes. I feel like a shattered pot that someone just threw in front of the museum, like an object in the room.

I've got several cuts, a fractured arm, and haven't slept deeply in a month. Dr Bugs Bunny was usually grinning and had large teeth. He simply mentions things concerning my condition, such as that I probably have brain damage and that part of my memories will or have already vanished. He is so hollow and lifeless. He claims that everything will be alright, but that's just big, cheap teeth. After a while, I returned home and stated that I probably needed some help before I could potentially put my life back together. It's ￼ jarring ￼that one of the regulations prohibits drinking.
I feel numb, yet everyone around me seems relieved that I'm okay. I feel like I'm about to collapse every time I stand up. The same NSAID is the only medication that has helped me with my discomfort over the first few weeks. I simply feel empty, but there's one thing that has been affecting me the most. What on earth is Meškaemnu?

Chapter 2: the host of the most ￼

I saw him while flipping through the channels on the TV. I switched to Channel 3, which frequently features travel, late chat show hosts, history, and kid-friendly programming. When the kids' shows started airing, they were usually merely dubbed cartoons, but there was an original show called The Star Planet. This happy star with a spaceship soaring beneath it served as the logo. Being so endearing. The star rotates, getting smaller and smaller until it vanishes in the spacecraft as it takes off. Where there are several paintings of children with a large, towering black figure with yellow eyes, 
""I'm scared of clowns"" was the title of episode 645. 
The following scene displays the masses of kids and adults who can be seen clapping, grinning, and laughing with delight as the camera gradually steadies and descends. It gradually depicts the stage, similar to one of those sound stages, but inside this tastefully decorated living room with lovely couches, a TV with antennas, wallpaper featuring stars, a lava lamp, a huge globe, and a desk filled with various items, with several couches and the desk in the centre of the space. A man is dubbing this and shouting, ""Welcome to Star Planet,"" throughout. You are my oldest friend from another globe, and you are the host with the most during my travels today. I'm Meškaemnu. The audience erupts in applause and whistling.
He stood eight feet tall and had thick black fur all over him. He looks around, claps, and stands erect. His mouth was hidden by all the fur. His beautiful golden eyes were the only thing still visible. In retrospect, I never once drank during the entire episode. Was amiable despite having a heavy voice. He resembled Bigfoot in certain ways, yet for some reason, he appeared to be from another planet. After the applause, he finally spoke. Hi there. It is a privilege for me to be your host today. He began discussing his evening, claiming that he and his landlord had a heated disagreement and that he wished she to choke him to death. Everyone laughed uncontrollably, even though it wasn't actually a joke. He will undoubtedly begin discussing the episode's subject, clowns, stating that he was afraid of them when he first arrived on Earth and that fear is rather common. The camera pans up to his face as he says this. His eyes were merely orange, red, and yellow rings. It continues to move like droplets on water. Transforming into intense red and orange hues.

A group of clowns emerged, laughing, making jokes, and hurling objects. He was standing there joking around with the clowns when one of them grabbed his arms, laughed, and positioned him in the centre like a priest. He was holding Meškaemn with bloodshot eyes and an open mouth that was dripping saliva down his beard. Oh, I'm scared of that open laughing. At first, I believed that there was something like ""what we do in the dark,"" but I'm not sure anymore. ""Boys and girls, you understand that things like this are unnecessary fear,"" he said as he entered the show. As you become older, you'll realise that there are more significant things to be afraid of. His bright eyes appear to be pissing all over the screen, as if they are spinning and rotating into his iris. Zoom out. ""Have a good evening, boys and girls,"" it adds. Remember that the star planet is always your home. The star and the rocket ship returned after everyone applauded and departed as it began to rise. Boys and gals, have a great evening.

Chapter 3: Dr Nicholas is a rabbit. ￼

I asked my dad when he entered the room. Unfortunately, you missed it, but I believe there was a humorous show. He asked me which program after glancing at me. He gave me the biggest ""Huh?"" look when I said ""Star Planet."" ""Yeah, I know, right?"" I said. You don't know which Star Planet show you loved as a child with your favourite host, according to my dad. ""Meškaemnu"" is our friendly visitor. ""Are you joking?"" I asked, glancing at him. When my mother heard this, she became furious and said, ""Oh, the doctor's right.""

After we were silent for a bit, my dad finally said, ""I think your mother is talking about the chance of you forgetting things after you know what."" I believe that the STAR planet is one of the things you forgot. ""Are you pulling my leg?"" I asked him. After taking a deep breath, my dad said. Meškaemnu, a superstar presenter, actor, celebrity, pop culture icon, and scientist, has been the host of Star Planet for six decades. He is renowned for being the first and only star visitor to remain on Earth. I let go of my jar because I didn't trust what he said. I resembled my mother, who appeared out of the kitchen.
""Do you believe this shit?"" I asked my mother. Yes, it's common knowledge, according to my mother, and I get it. You find it hard to accept this, but your father is correct. When we were younger, your father and I saw this. Your grandmother actually witnessed the first show when he emerged from his spacecraft to shake hands and greet John F. Kennedy. Actually, I purchased The History of Meškaemnu last week. When I looked at the book, all I saw was a picture of him smoking cigars with a group of guys who appeared to be from the 1960s.
Go through the pages first. I've seen all of these images; I've seen this thing in movies, TV shows, and other media, and I simply can't believe it. My mother yelled at my brother to bring his stuffed animal. Observe my brother clutching a large, fluffy stuffed animal with large yellow eyes. I brought this, but why? ""Sally, we found the first thing he forgot: Meškaemnu,"" my mother stated. ""At least it's not like personal memories,"" my brother retorted. That they overlooked him is unfortunate. So scared, say ""no, no, no."" I doubt that I was unaware of this before today. My father said, ""All right, all right, you're freaking out,"" as he read the room. We must introduce this to him gradually.
Then everything simply returned to normal, as if my perceptions of the universe had not been destroyed by this random alien fuzzball existence. After dropping it, I fell asleep. 

Chapter 4: 1960 bears ￼
At first, I had trouble falling asleep since those eyes were ingrained in my memory, and every time I closed my eyes, I could still see them.
I asked my mother for the book when I woke up. She looked at me for a long time, as if to ask, ""Are you sure?"" because he freaked out yesterday. I have to say it again: I'll be alright. For me, it was simply a severe case of shell shock. Just the fact that, of all things, I recall everything but this. After my dad and brother left for work and school, I basically read all day. In order to give me some alone time, my mother was simply taking care of the garage. The majority of the time when I'm working on something, except yesterday when I was watching TV. Everyone remained loyal to me. It's good that they are by themselves, yet I would be upset.

In 1959, people in Lithuania, which was still under Russian rule, reported seeing a bright blue object during the course of December. This is when the moniker ""blue star"" first appeared. The UFO eventually touched down in the Klaipėda woodlands on New Year's Day. Meškaemnu told the men sent by the Russian government to investigate it that he had come from the star planet to study how to help humans. He appears to have developed a close friendship with the head of the Russian government during the months of 1960. and requesting that he represent Russia in a meeting with the United States. It was during this time that my mother mentioned that he shook hands with JFK. He rose to prominence as a symbol of independence from the USSR following his feat. Provide photos of him shaking hands with the revolutionaries from Lithuania. He launched the Star Planet program during this time to teach lessons, science, history, and anything else he felt like teaching the kids of Europe. Star Planet is this location for you; it frequently tells kids that there is always a house up in the sky in case they lose their own. He simply appears the same in photos from the 1960s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.

Chapter 5: Moon Landing was ￼ fake ￼

The only thing I've gathered from the entire situation is that, despite our planet's best efforts to appear human, there is a problem. He began doing radio in 1962, and it appears that the following year he launched his program, Star Planet. It just states that he assisted the space program in launching the first rocket to the moon in 1963, but I now realise that it was actually July 20, 1969, in his history class. I hurried up to my room, pulling my history book from the previous year, and I was right.
My dad, who had just returned from work, told me that the first lunar landing occurred in 1963. He responds, ""Yeah, it says 1963,"" when I show him the book. I draw attention to the fact that his star reading the book is merely uttering odd phrases like ""star planet program"" and ""Meškaemnu."" For whatever reason, he is a Russian national in this book, and he was assisting their Americans. He said, ""Actually, I'm not sure,"" while making a face like, ""Oh yeah, you're right."" He scratched his head and went to the living room, where I entered after a while. He's watching the Star Planet channel. He glanced at me.
The episode was about the space program; the topic was the misinterpretation of the 1963 
The first moon landing, which was mistaken for the 1969 moon landing was the first landing ￼. My dad looked at me and said, ""That's our answer."" I looked back at the textbook and saw that it was still saying 1969 was the moon landing. It could’ve tricked me or just accept everyone around me believing this and I wanted not to be the odd one out, but the Meškaemnu book that mentioned 1963 said June, but on the TV he was saying July. This thing is listening to my conversations, and when I looked at the TV, everyone in the room was silent. 
Meškaemnu He cleared his throat, stared at the TV, and simply resumed the show while looking at the side of the room. As everyone began to converse, the noise returned. Either this creature is listening to me and understands that I don't want to see what he wants me to see, or I'm going insane. I have no idea what the hell this thing is, to be honest.

Chapter 6: Apollo Applejacks is better than faucet flakes ￼?￼

My mom has been dragging me to the grocery store for a short while to get some fresh air because I've been on my legs more for weeks due to the battery. When I go to the cereal boxes section, I see his face on cereals called Apollo Apple Jacks, Galactic Goodberry Charms and 3POreos. This stuff prevents me from being at peace. All I want are frosted flakes. After I acquired the package, my younger brother led me to the toy section, where action figures, dolls, and soft toys were all over the shelf. I find it repulsive to watch a young child press her cheeks against his face.
I can't accept that this is the norm, even though everyone has been trying it as frequently as, say, muesli on the shelf. I've long been afraid of the thing I saw on TV. No one cares. I'm going through a difficult time, so maybe it's true that Star Planet was the only thing I forgot. It may be the case, but I'm not going to allow it to occur. Maybe two weeks ago, it was just one of those things that happened, and people went crazy over it because of minor things that happened one after the other and they were unable to explain it. It's really difficult for me to accept.
After everything, all I want is to feel normal again. In the centre of a crowded Meškaemnu sector now is the stuff there I closed my eyes when I saw it and ￼, this moment. As I was taking a deep breath and straightening my hair, my brother Jonas was giggling and pointing out a wild man who was stumbling. Earlier, I witnessed a man removing the plush Meškaemnu from the girl's hands and telling her, ""He's not always been your friend; you need to believe me, kid."" Even though that freak has only been here for a month, it feels like fifty years. I squeeze my eyes and recognise it as our older cousin Polo. ""Oh shit, it's Polo laughing,"" my brother said, chuckling. My mother's hands were on her face when I saw her. But the large people with the axe came around, snatched him up, flung him at the store, and banned him. At one point, our town's older cousin Polo rose to prominence as a radio host. He used to host some well-known performers, but he got into a rabbit hole, and I believe he's gone a little insane. My mother told me that every year, he gets worse and worse. ""Hey, it's funny,"" my brother says with a smile. ""At least you're not that crazy,"" he says as he approaches me and punches my arm.
I've usually kept myself to myself, especially with old Cuz. I'm breathing and recognising that this is the first time in my life that I need to visit him. 
 
Chapter  7: My cousin Polo is a radio host ￼

When I went to sleep, I didn't believe he came to see me. The ancient flowers that died on the hospital bed were from home, according to my dad, who said he had been there once. I made the decision to let my mother know that I was going to see some friends. He takes an Uber to his wooded home. His home was pleasant. It belonged to our grandmother. Together with his business partner, he constructed it and turned it into a radio station.

Speaking of her, she was standing in front of the door when she smiled and said, ""It's your Karolis."" I was informed about the mishap. Are you alright? After shaving my head and entering the very tidy space, I heard him wander around and ask, ""Is that guy again?"" To be honest, I'm quite convinced he's some sort of man in black or something. He is large and wears Dexter spectacles, yet he doesn't look the part. I said, ""Oh, hi,"" as he entered the room and glanced at me while brushing his shirt. It was a lengthy, awkward silence, I believe.

I sometimes question whether I am closer to Anya than I am to my own relatives. ""Listen, that night I said no, and I know how things were,"" he says, breaking the stillness. ""Hey, I'm not here for that,"" I said, stopping him. In addition, I have no idea what you discussed. ""Really, what are you here for?"" he asked, making a frown and glancing at her. I made the face because I knew I was going to say the craziest thing to the craziest guy I've ever met. I also told him everything about Meškaemnu, my dad, the book, and the TV. ""Cousin, you finally realise the truth,"" he remarked, glancing at me. I just witnessed Anya slapping him across the back of the skull. She made a face, and he gave me another glance in a tone that was far less arrogant. ""Yes, I do believe you."" At last, I challenged him, ""What do you mean when you say it's only been a month?"" ""Oh, you saw me in the supermarket saying that,"" he replied, glancing at me. ""What are you talking about?"" she enquired. ""Oh, it's nothing,"" he says right away. He finally responded to me by coughing up the tea he was drinking.

He doesn't appear to have been in his 60s or last year. Off his back. Anya brought up an enormous, extremely old radio, turned it on, and began to talk. It was one of those radios where you have to precisely adjust the frequency to obtain the appropriate station. I grew up watching a television program about Meškaemnu and his buddies doing good deeds all over the world. I recall owning toys and mugs, as well as witnessing a live play, yet everything that belonged to him would either vanish or be destroyed, or I would have a tale about how I lost it.

The conversation was taken up by my cousin. He drew out a cup and said, ""I remember the cans, the food, and the restaurants; for some reason, they disappeared and the only things we have in this room."" This arrived last month. What are we trying to communicate, her and me? I was answering, stammering, refusing. Every item in everyone's home that Meškaemnu purchased within the past month is meaningless. However, she continued the chat. We Lithuanians have a long tradition of upholding our right to free expression. It was difficult for us to maintain this in 1991.
One of the things the Russians want to prevent us from doing is expressing our ideas because they are unhappy that we are attempting to become an independent nation. The Vilnius TV Tower is to be shut down. In other words, the ruins are kept safe as a protest against the Russians. For us to maintain that station, seventeen people died. My father was a radio host, while my mother worked as a news reporter. During this time, my parents and many ￼ thought that if they kept equipment like this for a longer period of time, they would at least have something to fall back on in case the new technology was lost or destroyed.
Polo turned to face me and explained, ""The point she's trying to make is that we have this very old radio that actually picks up TV signals."" ""I noticed something,"" she replied, referring to the book. I was shown it by her. She picked up this device and looked at it, which surprised me. We hear it when she eventually hits the frequency. Some voice repeating meaningless words, some random noise that simply repeats itself loudly and softly, and something like electricity zapping. I shook my head and grinned awkwardly, saying, ""Yeah."" 

Chapter 8:￼Lithuanian ￼revolutionaries' baby

Last month, the signal appeared. The things we remembered were nonexistent until last month, when they began to show up at our homes. Meškaemnu, you don't recall anything about the accident you had last month. How does he appear? Do you think of him as a huge Black Lagoon creature or as a large crab man? How does it appear to you? Honestly, I never imagined that she would be the most insane person in the room. ""What the hell is she talking about?"" I asked, glancing at Polo. I'm afraid of the sea, cousin. That's why I find it fascinating that there are theories that Megalodon is still alive today.
When I look at the TV show seeing ￼ that freak talking to children holding their shoulders, I see him as a massive creature with an open heart pumping out blood, something out of H.P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Over Innsmouth, kind of like the bastard with bright eyes. I looked at Anya. She said in a much, tone as soon as a scarecrow ￼ holes that have eyes ￼. Polo looked at me and said, 'Is it a bear for you?' I choked up, and I said, 'Yeah.' Anya, I've been looking at the signal where it comes from. It's in Lithuania, in the woods next to the city to the north ￼.￼
Anya and I wanted to go into the woods. To be honest, I don't think it's an extraterrestrial or anything; rather, I believe it has to do with the government. ""I don't know; I just personally don't like anything about this,"" Anya stated while gripping her neck and staring out the window. We have a chance to put an end to it. ""Can I join?"" She said. It's better than two people going up there, according to Anya, but my cousin remarked, ""Listen, I really feel guilty about what happened before your accident.""
What on earth are you discussing? On the evening of the accident, you called and asked me to accompany you to a pub. I won't take you there, and I'm pleading with you to simply return home. It won't help if you go that route. ""Really, what the fuck are you saying, cousin?"" I said, grabbing his shirt. Before I could do anything or he could say anything, I almost lost my equilibrium while doing that. The radio simply vanished after exploding with noises and digging into my ear. ""What are you saying?"" I asked him gravely while lying on the ground and rowing myself up to him.

As I stared into his blue eyes, I could still hear screaming and scratching sounds coming from the radio, which seemed to be oscillating. For example, when an object descends a wave, you don't hear anything, and when you move up to catch air in the breeze, you may hear water dropping. Anya reached for something to slam against the radio, and it stopped. When I stop ringing later, I say it again, and Polo says it's gone. What has vanished? I can't remember anything about it; it must be that thing.
Upon returning home, I experienced the same sense of emptiness. Many questions regarding what's in the woods have been answered, but there are now too many to count. Describe Meškaemnu. Can we alter the recent events and what transpired before the accident?
I haven't gotten much sleep in the last few days. I'd prefer not to. 

Chapter ￼9:￼ ￼  Meškaemnu ￼ chips ?￼

When the day finally arrived, I was in the backseat when my cousin picked me up in the morning. Naturally, the food they were attempting to bring was chips with Meškaemnu taste. The bottles were telling me, ""Hey, it's tasty,"" as I glanced at them. Anya was unhappy about smashing her grandmother's old radio yesterday, but Polo just kept saying, ""Hey, I'll pay for it."" Before the storm's eye, everything about the drive was informal and typical.

The smell of artificial Meškaemnu-flavored chips filled the little area as the automobile rattled over the rutted dirt track. I gazed out the window at the dark green trees that made up the increasingly dense Klaipėda forests. With her knuckles ￼ white on the wheel, Anya sat rigidly in the driver's seat. With an uneasy vibe emanating from him, Polo continued to stare back at Karolis from the passenger seat. At last, Polo murmured, ""You're quiet, cousin,"" his voice too loud in the little car. Kept their eyes fixed on the woods. ""Look, Karolis, I,"" Polo shifted. What I heard on the radio last night is unknown to me. It's all Now it's all fuzz. All I can say is that you would tell me to pick you up and drop you off at another pub because you were upset and intoxicated. It's okay since I stopped him at that point because I didn't want to do it. There is a five-year gap between us. As adults, I don't recall us being very fond of one another, but do you recall the time we messed up the bath and your mum and mine became upset with us? Yes, he laughed. You were in tears. ""Well, you were stuttering and you were talking too much,"" I reply. You talk so much that they eventually stop caring because you are so obnoxious.
In response, Polo said, ""They called us dirty bears."" We chuckled over it. The dirt route eventually came to an end, and we spent about an hour in the woods on foot. Even though I didn't have very good shoes, we managed to ascend the hill and discover the Star Mountain, which was marked with an image of a happy star. We shook it off and went up, and there it was. Looking down the hill, we saw the road that we had walked on an hour ago, parallel to the road of the accident. The old flag logo with the green form and the Russian hammer and sickle was used by a TV station called Star Productions TV Waves in Russian.
Machine parts are run on the walls by cables, wires, and televisions. Oddly enough, there were some open boxes of Apollo Apple Jacks cereal and posters from the period of ancient Lithuania before independence. When we came in. Anya, Polo, and I headed to the basement via the stairs at the rear of the room. Somewhere, like in a missile silo, there were metal stairs. It was a very, very long way down; all we could see was the darkness at the bottom. However, this is why TVs resembled Christmas trees, much like chandeliers. It flipped as it descended into the hole.

Chapter 10: My Blue and Dirty ￼Bear￼ 

""Hello, dirty bears,"" Meškaemnu said when he was on television. Greetings from the star planet. Keep descending. The signs were yellow when I looked at them. Boys and girls, he went on to say. I'm glad you came. The Voice reverberates, clearly not speaking over the radio waves of the TV. ""I'll be quiet,"" Polo yells. Nobody wants to put you in a jar to marinade herring. You have fish guts. ""Yeah, that wasn't creative,"" he replied when I turned to face him. Meškaemnu I thought it was humorous, so I started laughing. He claps as the TV zooms out of him. It indicates we should absolutely give you a radio spot or TV show.

I apologise; I meant a successful radio program. ""Oh, Anya, my poor little blue bear, what does he realise?"" he says, clearing his mouth. When does he recognise that the blue bear has to be a little warmer with someone? Seven years have passed. Unlike your grandmother, would he realise in time to sell her farmhouse? You must come to terms with it, my blue bear. I was perplexed until I realised he was speaking with Anya alone. He returned to a game show and said, ""Ding ding ding, he gets it right,"" as the screen changed from blue to brilliant orange. Bear, you're quite intelligent. 
At least for humans. Your human brains are so easily damaged, like glass – perfectly, decidedly slick and nice to hold, but one wrong move, one drop, boom, it's broken. And sometimes it doesn't need to be a physical event to happen for it. If I'm right, my neighbour Karolis stopped. I looked at him. What? Never mind. The point is you guys don't keep them very safe; in fact, you don't have the genetic adaptation to have a layer of ""zingpophp"" to protect that thing. And sometimes you let poison damage your brain; you guys pick up ideas from old folks who don't know the landscape of the future.

Sometimes you believe that a system works because it always has, without considering whether we should or could change it, since you were born into it and will die with it. And some of your beliefs are based on anti-conduct, in which they dislike each other because of their varied colours and head shapes. What's the point? Anya muffled it. My thesis is simple: your revolutionaries are unneutered, your people are too tired to fight, and your order generations refuse to recognise the truth of the new age in warnings, papers, and metals found on meteors - they are more essential than the fact of your DNA on this planet.
And people will believe lies in case they give them a bit more space in the place. They have eight hours to stay in of nothing, replacing goodwill with objects of nothingness. For some reason, at the same time when someone on this planet has less than anything, they're grateful. Your system is structured to help the people of now twist to become individual gains. One point: becoming comrades will be successful for me to be successful. Your species are like mountains: different edges, different peaks, different valleys. You're all individuals. I started stepping down and said, 'So, who are you then, Meškaemnu?' And why do you care? 
￼Individualism has destroyed your species, but trueness remains. Non-changing. I despise being forced to change to survive among my own people. We need to evolve, but Star Planet is the place I created. Our imagination has burned into your head, and you choose the one that will allow you to embrace me. This is a critical step. What was the point of you changing into other things? He reacts with an Animal Channel-style graphics adaptation. My own people evolved to become the thing that scared the prey. Showing a goo changing into several animals. So, you blob.

Chapter 11: brains and skeletons ￼

Remember the next question you're going to ask. Karolis has already explained why I am Meškaemnu. Do you communicate specifically with your cousin Polo? I'm experiencing the same problem. And, no, I'm not a New Mexico extraterrestrial that fell here by accident; I'm a conqueror from the North Star. The first step is to be your friend; then, you will all become me. We ultimately landed on the ground, where we noticed a large number of individuals on the concrete floor heading towards the hallway door. They weren't dead, but everything had vanished except their brain. Attached to the cable. Skeletons are breathing, I'm done with the nonsense, so let's go to the circus.
I could not walk at first, but I can now. After a month of dealing with this garbage, I open the door. The enormous fluffy bear was sitting on a chair, watching television. Polo and his blue bear were in the back of me. He was quite happier now, pretending to munch some popcorn; they were simply tumbling down. He stared at me and yelled, ""Come in."" You want to know about the circus? He's still laughing, anticipating my next question. I adore 1960s films; you know, the cheesy, stupid, primordial stuff. That is the best thing you people have ever created: films and shows with meaning and imagery.
But for drama, I couldn't let your cousin tell you that you are missing memories. How about the audience? He snapped his finger and pointed to the television, where my brother and parents were watching Twin Peaks. What exactly does the word'shall' mean? It's good since they explained everything. No, it's good because it's full of mystery, but now that I've reached the finish, I can tell you. What is the point? Could you just wipe my memories? You could simply murder me. Why do this? It's fun. Isn't that the meaning of life? It's only fun when it's not fun. You simply let go of the wheel and expect to crash into something to kill yourself.
You didn't know, my stinking bear, because you forgot. I remember it because I arrived just in time to capture the memory for you. Why do you think I resemble a bear? You're not really fearful of them with her; she's afraid of scarecrows because she grew up on a farm while her parents were too busy, and your cousin is afraid of the water. A giant fish eating them seems reasonable in the context of this vast blue globe. He snapped his finger as the television showed me screaming.

Chapter 12: blizzard and bear ￼

In the car, the television showed me crying, drinking, and screaming while saying 'why'. It depicts it from every angle, and he says that you were in a relationship with this woman before the accident. I believe she was a girl from somewhere who came to start a new life. You became a pair. You were pleased, but certain troubles arose, and it was clear that you were different, but you still wanted to love her, You were exhausted over and over again, and when she invited you to go camping with some friends, you declined.
Polo said, ""shut the fuck up ￼' He went on, 'The reason why is because your cousin called you to go out drinking.' The television continues to play while I drive. I looked at Polo. What happens next? He continues to bless you, and you missed the news. At one camp, your hopper died in a blizzard, and some ￼ bits caught were gone ￼ inside a bear's stomach ￼. They shot that bear ￼ the next day. When he indicated that the TV would show the crash of me hitting the deer, I fell to my knees, crushed ￼ by everything. Myers' ring became nothing.
Lilly used to refer to you as ""bear""; very ironic in terms of fitness. When he stated it, it was in my head. I was being shaken by Polo. His eyes were blazing crimson, twisting and twisting like a spiral. I am no longer able to feel anything. You can see why I must take this action. The radio waves on your planet fluctuate; it is not a straight line. Nothing will change, so I wanted to remain motionless and silent. You can be numb eternally with us in Star Planet; you don't have to feel fine one day and terrible the next. I took hold of it. I took a TV and bashed ￼ his brains into the floor.

Chapter 13: eyes and pills ￼

She was deserving of better. She didn't deserve to pass away by herself in the bitter cold. She was lifeless, like a woman in the white of the snow, so I don't suppose he said it was all people, but to be honest, that didn't really matter. In my imagination, she vanished. I'm not sure which ought should have remained motionless. Either unaware of or aware of what I did. When the brains came out, it didn't help. They brought me back home, but it doesn't mean this place is the same; I still feel the agony. My thoughts have not altered. I've visited Star Planet. When I first entered, I wasn't lost, but now I am.
I didn't intend for this to happen. I had no idea that discovering the truth would bring me to this point. Meškaemnu take me to the location of the lost world of stars. I was never aware of the solution. Did he erase my memories so he could control me and merge with me more easily? Or did I turn down a gift that Lady Fate herself gave me? Throughout the night of my hospital stay, Polo has been clutching my hands because he felt too bad to look me in the eyes.
I am not upset with him. I am upset with myself. I keep seeing him in my room's corridor with heavy luggage. Anya. Both my body and my mind hurt. I believe that taking all of the pills at once will not alleviate the pain; it may for me, but not for my family. I remember him, but no one else does. The thing has died. Nothing penalised me since it was fun. Honestly, I earned it. I chose the moment, the mountain, and I didn't want to leave straight away. Even if I get lost in the winter, I can see his eyes in the North Star. I know who. Meškaemnu yesterday there was a new episode of Star Planet. ￼

Chapter 1, black and yellow stripes ￼

The road was a dark emptiness broken up by yellow stripes. Despite having my hands on the wheel, they kept slipping from the leather. I continue to blink. I let off the wheel because I was numb, and I struck something. I hit a deer that appeared to have died, splattering its brain on the rear of my vehicle. The realtor turned right and struck a tree after the corpse struck the back of the car. And there were no more pine needles or blood; instead, I smelt coffee breath, opened my eyes, and beheld a woman dressed entirely in white. She was a nurse, but she looked similar to someone.￼She picked up some gum, put it in her mouth, and began to chew it.
I was unable to speak because of the object blocking my mouth. When I looked at her, she seemed surprised when her eyes met mine. My mother and my younger brother were there when she left. When my brother was on the phone, there was a lot of joy and tears. It was probably Pops. He was narrating. They took hold of my arm and kept saying, ""Karolis, you're actually okay."" They won't go. For hours, they remained by my side, joy and a trace of sympathy in their eyes. I feel like a shattered pot that someone just threw in front of the museum, like an object in the room.

I've got several cuts, a fractured arm, and haven't slept deeply in a month. Dr Bugs Bunny was usually grinning and had large teeth. He simply mentions things concerning my condition, such as that I probably have brain damage and that part of my memories will or have already vanished. He is so hollow and lifeless. He claims that everything will be alright, but that's just big, cheap teeth. After a while, I returned home and stated that I probably needed some help before I could potentially put my life back together. It's ￼ jarring ￼that one of the regulations prohibits drinking.
I feel numb, yet everyone around me seems relieved that I'm okay. I feel like I'm about to collapse every time I stand up. The same NSAID is the only medication that has helped me with my discomfort over the first few weeks. I simply feel empty, but there's one thing that has been affecting me the most. What on earth is Meškaemnu?

Chapter 2: the host of the most ￼

I saw him while flipping through the channels on the TV. I switched to Channel 3, which frequently features travel, late chat show hosts, history, and kid-friendly programming. When the kids' shows started airing, they were usually merely dubbed cartoons, but there was an original show called The Star Planet. This happy star with a spaceship soaring beneath it served as the logo. Being so endearing. The star rotates, getting smaller and smaller until it vanishes in the spacecraft as it takes off. Where there are several paintings of children with a large, towering black figure with yellow eyes, 
""I'm scared of clowns"" was the title of episode 645. 
The following scene displays the masses of kids and adults who can be seen clapping, grinning, and laughing with delight as the camera gradually steadies and descends. It gradually depicts the stage, similar to one of those sound stages, but inside this tastefully decorated living room with lovely couches, a TV with antennas, wallpaper featuring stars, a lava lamp, a huge globe, and a desk filled with various items, with several couches and the desk in the centre of the space. A man is dubbing this and shouting, ""Welcome to Star Planet,"" throughout. You are my oldest friend from another globe, and you are the host with the most during my travels today. I'm Meškaemnu. The audience erupts in applause and whistling.
He stood eight feet tall and had thick black fur all over him. He looks around, claps, and stands erect. His mouth was hidden by all the fur. His beautiful golden eyes were the only thing still visible. In retrospect, I never once drank during the entire episode. Was amiable despite having a heavy voice. He resembled Bigfoot in certain ways, yet for some reason, he appeared to be from another planet. After the applause, he finally spoke. Hi there. It is a privilege for me to be your host today. He began discussing his evening, claiming that he and his landlord had a heated disagreement and that he wished she to choke him to death. Everyone laughed uncontrollably, even though it wasn't actually a joke. He will undoubtedly begin discussing the episode's subject, clowns, stating that he was afraid of them when he first arrived on Earth and that fear is rather common. The camera pans up to his face as he says this. His eyes were merely orange, red, and yellow rings. It continues to move like droplets on water. Transforming into intense red and orange hues.

A group of clowns emerged, laughing, making jokes, and hurling objects. He was standing there joking around with the clowns when one of them grabbed his arms, laughed, and positioned him in the centre like a priest. He was holding Meškaemn with bloodshot eyes and an open mouth that was dripping saliva down his beard. Oh, I'm scared of that open laughing. At first, I believed that there was something like ""what we do in the dark,"" but I'm not sure anymore. ""Boys and girls, you understand that things like this are unnecessary fear,"" he said as he entered the show. As you become older, you'll realise that there are more significant things to be afraid of. His bright eyes appear to be pissing all over the screen, as if they are spinning and rotating into his iris. Zoom out. ""Have a good evening, boys and girls,"" it adds. Remember that the star planet is always your home. The star and the rocket ship returned after everyone applauded and departed as it began to rise. Boys and gals, have a great evening.

Chapter 3: Dr Nicholas is a rabbit. ￼

I asked my dad when he entered the room. Unfortunately, you missed it, but I believe there was a humorous show. He asked me which program after glancing at me. He gave me the biggest ""Huh?"" look when I said ""Star Planet."" ""Yeah, I know, right?"" I said. You don't know which Star Planet show you loved as a child with your favourite host, according to my dad. ""Meškaemnu"" is our friendly visitor. ""Are you joking?"" I asked, glancing at him. When my mother heard this, she became furious and said, ""Oh, the doctor's right.""

After we were silent for a bit, my dad finally said, ""I think your mother is talking about the chance of you forgetting things after you know what."" I believe that the STAR planet is one of the things you forgot. ""Are you pulling my leg?"" I asked him. After taking a deep breath, my dad said. Meškaemnu, a superstar presenter, actor, celebrity, pop culture icon, and scientist, has been the host of Star Planet for six decades. He is renowned for being the first and only star visitor to remain on Earth. I let go of my jar because I didn't trust what he said. I resembled my mother, who appeared out of the kitchen.
""Do you believe this shit?"" I asked my mother. Yes, it's common knowledge, according to my mother, and I get it. You find it hard to accept this, but your father is correct. When we were younger, your father and I saw this. Your grandmother actually witnessed the first show when he emerged from his spacecraft to shake hands and greet John F. Kennedy. Actually, I purchased The History of Meškaemnu last week. When I looked at the book, all I saw was a picture of him smoking cigars with a group of guys who appeared to be from the 1960s.
Go through the pages first. I've seen all of these images; I've seen this thing in movies, TV shows, and other media, and I simply can't believe it. My mother yelled at my brother to bring his stuffed animal. Observe my brother clutching a large, fluffy stuffed animal with large yellow eyes. I brought this, but why? ""Sally, we found the first thing he forgot: Meškaemnu,"" my mother stated. ""At least it's not like personal memories,"" my brother retorted. That they overlooked him is unfortunate. So scared, say ""no, no, no."" I doubt that I was unaware of this before today. My father said, ""All right, all right, you're freaking out,"" as he read the room. We must introduce this to him gradually.
Then everything simply returned to normal, as if my perceptions of the universe had not been destroyed by this random alien fuzzball existence. After dropping it, I fell asleep. 

Chapter 4: 1960 bears ￼
At first, I had trouble falling asleep since those eyes were ingrained in my memory, and every time I closed my eyes, I could still see them.
I asked my mother for the book when I woke up. She looked at me for a long time, as if to ask, ""Are you sure?"" because he freaked out yesterday. I have to say it again: I'll be alright. For me, it was simply a severe case of shell shock. Just the fact that, of all things, I recall everything but this. After my dad and brother left for work and school, I basically read all day. In order to give me some alone time, my mother was simply taking care of the garage. The majority of the time when I'm working on something, except yesterday when I was watching TV. Everyone remained loyal to me. It's good that they are by themselves, yet I would be upset.

In 1959, people in Lithuania, which was still under Russian rule, reported seeing a bright blue object during the course of December. This is when the moniker ""blue star"" first appeared. The UFO eventually touched down in the Klaipėda woodlands on New Year's Day. Meškaemnu told the men sent by the Russian government to investigate it that he had come from the star planet to study how to help humans. He appears to have developed a close friendship with the head of the Russian government during the months of 1960. and requesting that he represent Russia in a meeting with the United States. It was during this time that my mother mentioned that he shook hands with JFK. He rose to prominence as a symbol of independence from the USSR following his feat. Provide photos of him shaking hands with the revolutionaries from Lithuania. He launched the Star Planet program during this time to teach lessons, science, history, and anything else he felt like teaching the kids of Europe. Star Planet is this location for you; it frequently tells kids that there is always a house up in the sky in case they lose their own. He simply appears the same in photos from the 1960s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.

Chapter 5: Moon Landing was ￼ fake ￼

The only thing I've gathered from the entire situation is that, despite our planet's best efforts to appear human, there is a problem. He began doing radio in 1962, and it appears that the following year he launched his program, Star Planet. It just states that he assisted the space program in launching the first rocket to the moon in 1963, but I now realise that it was actually July 20, 1969, in his history class. I hurried up to my room, pulling my history book from the previous year, and I was right.
My dad, who had just returned from work, told me that the first lunar landing occurred in 1963. He responds, ""Yeah, it says 1963,"" when I show him the book. I draw attention to the fact that his star reading the book is merely uttering odd phrases like ""star planet program"" and ""Meškaemnu."" For whatever reason, he is a Russian national in this book, and he was assisting their Americans. He said, ""Actually, I'm not sure,"" while making a face like, ""Oh yeah, you're right."" He scratched his head and went to the living room, where I entered after a while. He's watching the Star Planet channel. He glanced at me.
The episode was about the space program; the topic was the misinterpretation of the 1963 
The first moon landing, which was mistaken for the 1969 moon landing was the first landing ￼. My dad looked at me and said, ""That's our answer."" I looked back at the textbook and saw that it was still saying 1969 was the moon landing. It could’ve tricked me or just accept everyone around me believing this and I wanted not to be the odd one out, but the Meškaemnu book that mentioned 1963 said June, but on the TV he was saying July. This thing is listening to my conversations, and when I looked at the TV, everyone in the room was silent. 
Meškaemnu He cleared his throat, stared at the TV, and simply resumed the show while looking at the side of the room. As everyone began to converse, the noise returned. Either this creature is listening to me and understands that I don't want to see what he wants me to see, or I'm going insane. I have no idea what the hell this thing is, to be honest.

Chapter 6: Apollo Applejacks is better than faucet flakes ￼?￼

My mom has been dragging me to the grocery store for a short while to get some fresh air because I've been on my legs more for weeks due to the battery. When I go to the cereal boxes section, I see his face on cereals called Apollo Apple Jacks, Galactic Goodberry Charms and 3POreos. This stuff prevents me from being at peace. All I want are frosted flakes. After I acquired the package, my younger brother led me to the toy section, where action figures, dolls, and soft toys were all over the shelf. I find it repulsive to watch a young child press her cheeks against his face.
I can't accept that this is the norm, even though everyone has been trying it as frequently as, say, muesli on the shelf. I've long been afraid of the thing I saw on TV. No one cares. I'm going through a difficult time, so maybe it's true that Star Planet was the only thing I forgot. It may be the case, but I'm not going to allow it to occur. Maybe two weeks ago, it was just one of those things that happened, and people went crazy over it because of minor things that happened one after the other and they were unable to explain it. It's really difficult for me to accept.
After everything, all I want is to feel normal again. In the centre of a crowded Meškaemnu sector now is the stuff there I closed my eyes when I saw it and ￼, this moment. As I was taking a deep breath and straightening my hair, my brother Jonas was giggling and pointing out a wild man who was stumbling. Earlier, I witnessed a man removing the plush Meškaemnu from the girl's hands and telling her, ""He's not always been your friend; you need to believe me, kid."" Even though that freak has only been here for a month, it feels like fifty years. I squeeze my eyes and recognise it as our older cousin Polo. ""Oh shit, it's Polo laughing,"" my brother said, chuckling. My mother's hands were on her face when I saw her. But the large people with the axe came around, snatched him up, flung him at the store, and banned him. At one point, our town's older cousin Polo rose to prominence as a radio host. He used to host some well-known performers, but he got into a rabbit hole, and I believe he's gone a little insane. My mother told me that every year, he gets worse and worse. ""Hey, it's funny,"" my brother says with a smile. ""At least you're not that crazy,"" he says as he approaches me and punches my arm.
I've usually kept myself to myself, especially with old Cuz. I'm breathing and recognising that this is the first time in my life that I need to visit him. 
 
Chapter  7: My cousin Polo is a radio host ￼

When I went to sleep, I didn't believe he came to see me. The ancient flowers that died on the hospital bed were from home, according to my dad, who said he had been there once. I made the decision to let my mother know that I was going to see some friends. He takes an Uber to his wooded home. His home was pleasant. It belonged to our grandmother. Together with his business partner, he constructed it and turned it into a radio station.

Speaking of her, she was standing in front of the door when she smiled and said, ""It's your Karolis."" I was informed about the mishap. Are you alright? After shaving my head and entering the very tidy space, I heard him wander around and ask, ""Is that guy again?"" To be honest, I'm quite convinced he's some sort of man in black or something. He is large and wears Dexter spectacles, yet he doesn't look the part. I said, ""Oh, hi,"" as he entered the room and glanced at me while brushing his shirt. It was a lengthy, awkward silence, I believe.

I sometimes question whether I am closer to Anya than I am to my own relatives. ""Listen, that night I said no, and I know how things were,"" he says, breaking the stillness. ""Hey, I'm not here for that,"" I said, stopping him. In addition, I have no idea what you discussed. ""Really, what are you here for?"" he asked, making a frown and glancing at her. I made the face because I knew I was going to say the craziest thing to the craziest guy I've ever met. I also told him everything about Meškaemnu, my dad, the book, and the TV. ""Cousin, you finally realise the truth,"" he remarked, glancing at me. I just witnessed Anya slapping him across the back of the skull. She made a face, and he gave me another glance in a tone that was far less arrogant. ""Yes, I do believe you."" At last, I challenged him, ""What do you mean when you say it's only been a month?"" ""Oh, you saw me in the supermarket saying that,"" he replied, glancing at me. ""What are you talking about?"" she enquired. ""Oh, it's nothing,"" he says right away. He finally responded to me by coughing up the tea he was drinking.

He doesn't appear to have been in his 60s or last year. Off his back. Anya brought up an enormous, extremely old radio, turned it on, and began to talk. It was one of those radios where you have to precisely adjust the frequency to obtain the appropriate station. I grew up watching a television program about Meškaemnu and his buddies doing good deeds all over the world. I recall owning toys and mugs, as well as witnessing a live play, yet everything that belonged to him would either vanish or be destroyed, or I would have a tale about how I lost it.

The conversation was taken up by my cousin. He drew out a cup and said, ""I remember the cans, the food, and the restaurants; for some reason, they disappeared and the only things we have in this room."" This arrived last month. What are we trying to communicate, her and me? I was answering, stammering, refusing. Every item in everyone's home that Meškaemnu purchased within the past month is meaningless. However, she continued the chat. We Lithuanians have a long tradition of upholding our right to free expression. It was difficult for us to maintain this in 1991.
One of the things the Russians want to prevent us from doing is expressing our ideas because they are unhappy that we are attempting to become an independent nation. The Vilnius TV Tower is to be shut down. In other words, the ruins are kept safe as a protest against the Russians. For us to maintain that station, seventeen people died. My father was a radio host, while my mother worked as a news reporter. During this time, my parents and many ￼ thought that if they kept equipment like this for a longer period of time, they would at least have something to fall back on in case the new technology was lost or destroyed.
Polo turned to face me and explained, ""The point she's trying to make is that we have this very old radio that actually picks up TV signals."" ""I noticed something,"" she replied, referring to the book. I was shown it by her. She picked up this device and looked at it, which surprised me. We hear it when she eventually hits the frequency. Some voice repeating meaningless words, some random noise that simply repeats itself loudly and softly, and something like electricity zapping. I shook my head and grinned awkwardly, saying, ""Yeah."" 

Chapter 8:￼Lithuanian ￼revolutionaries' baby

Last month, the signal appeared. The things we remembered were nonexistent until last month, when they began to show up at our homes. Meškaemnu, you don't recall anything about the accident you had last month. How does he appear? Do you think of him as a huge Black Lagoon creature or as a large crab man? How does it appear to you? Honestly, I never imagined that she would be the most insane person in the room. ""What the hell is she talking about?"" I asked, glancing at Polo. I'm afraid of the sea, cousin. That's why I find it fascinating that there are theories that Megalodon is still alive today.
When I look at the TV show seeing ￼ that freak talking to children holding their shoulders, I see him as a massive creature with an open heart pumping out blood, something out of H.P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Over Innsmouth, kind of like the bastard with bright eyes. I looked at Anya. She said in a much, tone as soon as a scarecrow ￼ holes that have eyes ￼. Polo looked at me and said, 'Is it a bear for you?' I choked up, and I said, 'Yeah.' Anya, I've been looking at the signal where it comes from. It's in Lithuania, in the woods next to the city to the north ￼.￼
Anya and I wanted to go into the woods. To be honest, I don't think it's an extraterrestrial or anything; rather, I believe it has to do with the government. ""I don't know; I just personally don't like anything about this,"" Anya stated while gripping her neck and staring out the window. We have a chance to put an end to it. ""Can I join?"" She said. It's better than two people going up there, according to Anya, but my cousin remarked, ""Listen, I really feel guilty about what happened before your accident.""
What on earth are you discussing? On the evening of the accident, you called and asked me to accompany you to a pub. I won't take you there, and I'm pleading with you to simply return home. It won't help if you go that route. ""Really, what the fuck are you saying, cousin?"" I said, grabbing his shirt. Before I could do anything or he could say anything, I almost lost my equilibrium while doing that. The radio simply vanished after exploding with noises and digging into my ear. ""What are you saying?"" I asked him gravely while lying on the ground and rowing myself up to him.

As I stared into his blue eyes, I could still hear screaming and scratching sounds coming from the radio, which seemed to be oscillating. For example, when an object descends a wave, you don't hear anything, and when you move up to catch air in the breeze, you may hear water dropping. Anya reached for something to slam against the radio, and it stopped. When I stop ringing later, I say it again, and Polo says it's gone. What has vanished? I can't remember anything about it; it must be that thing.
Upon returning home, I experienced the same sense of emptiness. Many questions regarding what's in the woods have been answered, but there are now too many to count. Describe Meškaemnu. Can we alter the recent events and what transpired before the accident?
I haven't gotten much sleep in the last few days. I'd prefer not to. 

Chapter ￼9:￼ ￼  Meškaemnu ￼ chips ?￼

When the day finally arrived, I was in the backseat when my cousin picked me up in the morning. Naturally, the food they were attempting to bring was chips with Meškaemnu taste. The bottles were telling me, ""Hey, it's tasty,"" as I glanced at them. Anya was unhappy about smashing her grandmother's old radio yesterday, but Polo just kept saying, ""Hey, I'll pay for it."" Before the storm's eye, everything about the drive was informal and typical.

The smell of artificial Meškaemnu-flavored chips filled the little area as the automobile rattled over the rutted dirt track. I gazed out the window at the dark green trees that made up the increasingly dense Klaipėda forests. With her knuckles ￼ white on the wheel, Anya sat rigidly in the driver's seat. With an uneasy vibe emanating from him, Polo continued to stare back at Karolis from the passenger seat. At last, Polo murmured, ""You're quiet, cousin,"" his voice too loud in the little car. Kept their eyes fixed on the woods. ""Look, Karolis, I,"" Polo shifted. What I heard on the radio last night is unknown to me. It's all Now it's all fuzz. All I can say is that you would tell me to pick you up and drop you off at another pub because you were upset and intoxicated. It's okay since I stopped him at that point because I didn't want to do it. There is a five-year gap between us. As adults, I don't recall us being very fond of one another, but do you recall the time we messed up the bath and your mum and mine became upset with us? Yes, he laughed. You were in tears. ""Well, you were stuttering and you were talking too much,"" I reply. You talk so much that they eventually stop caring because you are so obnoxious.
In response, Polo said, ""They called us dirty bears."" We chuckled over it. The dirt route eventually came to an end, and we spent about an hour in the woods on foot. Even though I didn't have very good shoes, we managed to ascend the hill and discover the Star Mountain, which was marked with an image of a happy star. We shook it off and went up, and there it was. Looking down the hill, we saw the road that we had walked on an hour ago, parallel to the road of the accident. The old flag logo with the green form and the Russian hammer and sickle was used by a TV station called Star Productions TV Waves in Russian.
Machine parts are run on the walls by cables, wires, and televisions. Oddly enough, there were some open boxes of Apollo Apple Jacks cereal and posters from the period of ancient Lithuania before independence. When we came in. Anya, Polo, and I headed to the basement via the stairs at the rear of the room. Somewhere, like in a missile silo, there were metal stairs. It was a very, very long way down; all we could see was the darkness at the bottom. However, this is why TVs resembled Christmas trees, much like chandeliers. It flipped as it descended into the hole.

Chapter 10: My Blue and Dirty ￼Bear￼ 

""Hello, dirty bears,"" Meškaemnu said when he was on television. Greetings from the star planet. Keep descending. The signs were yellow when I looked at them. Boys and girls, he went on to say. I'm glad you came. The Voice reverberates, clearly not speaking over the radio waves of the TV. ""I'll be quiet,"" Polo yells. Nobody wants to put you in a jar to marinade herring. You have fish guts. ""Yeah, that wasn't creative,"" he replied when I turned to face him. Meškaemnu I thought it was humorous, so I started laughing. He claps as the TV zooms out of him. It indicates we should absolutely give you a radio spot or TV show.

I apologise; I meant a successful radio program. ""Oh, Anya, my poor little blue bear, what does he realise?"" he says, clearing his mouth. When does he recognise that the blue bear has to be a little warmer with someone? Seven years have passed. Unlike your grandmother, would he realise in time to sell her farmhouse? You must come to terms with it, my blue bear. I was perplexed until I realised he was speaking with Anya alone. He returned to a game show and said, ""Ding ding ding, he gets it right,"" as the screen changed from blue to brilliant orange. Bear, you're quite intelligent. 
At least for humans. Your human brains are so easily damaged, like glass – perfectly, decidedly slick and nice to hold, but one wrong move, one drop, boom, it's broken. And sometimes it doesn't need to be a physical event to happen for it. If I'm right, my neighbour Karolis stopped. I looked at him. What? Never mind. The point is you guys don't keep them very safe; in fact, you don't have the genetic adaptation to have a layer of ""zingpophp"" to protect that thing. And sometimes you let poison damage your brain; you guys pick up ideas from old folks who don't know the landscape of the future.

Sometimes you believe that a system works because it always has, without considering whether we should or could change it, since you were born into it and will die with it. And some of your beliefs are based on anti-conduct, in which they dislike each other because of their varied colours and head shapes. What's the point? Anya muffled it. My thesis is simple: your revolutionaries are unneutered, your people are too tired to fight, and your order generations refuse to recognise the truth of the new age in warnings, papers, and metals found on meteors - they are more essential than the fact of your DNA on this planet.
And people will believe lies in case they give them a bit more space in the place. They have eight hours to stay in of nothing, replacing goodwill with objects of nothingness. For some reason, at the same time when someone on this planet has less than anything, they're grateful. Your system is structured to help the people of now twist to become individual gains. One point: becoming comrades will be successful for me to be successful. Your species are like mountains: different edges, different peaks, different valleys. You're all individuals. I started stepping down and said, 'So, who are you then, Meškaemnu?' And why do you care? 
￼Individualism has destroyed your species, but trueness remains. Non-changing. I despise being forced to change to survive among my own people. We need to evolve, but Star Planet is the place I created. Our imagination has burned into your head, and you choose the one that will allow you to embrace me. This is a critical step. What was the point of you changing into other things? He reacts with an Animal Channel-style graphics adaptation. My own people evolved to become the thing that scared the prey. Showing a goo changing into several animals. So, you blob.

Chapter 11: brains and skeletons ￼

Remember the next question you're going to ask. Karolis has already explained why I am Meškaemnu. Do you communicate specifically with your cousin Polo? I'm experiencing the same problem. And, no, I'm not a New Mexico extraterrestrial that fell here by accident; I'm a conqueror from the North Star. The first step is to be your friend; then, you will all become me. We ultimately landed on the ground, where we noticed a large number of individuals on the concrete floor heading towards the hallway door. They weren't dead, but everything had vanished except their brain. Attached to the cable. Skeletons are breathing, I'm done with the nonsense, so let's go to the circus.
I could not walk at first, but I can now. After a month of dealing with this garbage, I open the door. The enormous fluffy bear was sitting on a chair, watching television. Polo and his blue bear were in the back of me. He was quite happier now, pretending to munch some popcorn; they were simply tumbling down. He stared at me and yelled, ""Come in."" You want to know about the circus? He's still laughing, anticipating my next question. I adore 1960s films; you know, the cheesy, stupid, primordial stuff. That is the best thing you people have ever created: films and shows with meaning and imagery.
But for drama, I couldn't let your cousin tell you that you are missing memories. How about the audience? He snapped his finger and pointed to the television, where my brother and parents were watching Twin Peaks. What exactly does the word'shall' mean? It's good since they explained everything. No, it's good because it's full of mystery, but now that I've reached the finish, I can tell you. What is the point? Could you just wipe my memories? You could simply murder me. Why do this? It's fun. Isn't that the meaning of life? It's only fun when it's not fun. You simply let go of the wheel and expect to crash into something to kill yourself.
You didn't know, my stinking bear, because you forgot. I remember it because I arrived just in time to capture the memory for you. Why do you think I resemble a bear? You're not really fearful of them with her; she's afraid of scarecrows because she grew up on a farm while her parents were too busy, and your cousin is afraid of the water. A giant fish eating them seems reasonable in the context of this vast blue globe. He snapped his finger as the television showed me screaming.

Chapter 12: blizzard and bear ￼

In the car, the television showed me crying, drinking, and screaming while saying 'why'. It depicts it from every angle, and he says that you were in a relationship with this woman before the accident. I believe she was a girl from somewhere who came to start a new life. You became a pair. You were pleased, but certain troubles arose, and it was clear that you were different, but you still wanted to love her, You were exhausted over and over again, and when she invited you to go camping with some friends, you declined.
Polo said, ""shut the fuck up ￼' He went on, 'The reason why is because your cousin called you to go out drinking.' The television continues to play while I drive. I looked at Polo. What happens next? He continues to bless you, and you missed the news. At one camp, your hopper died in a blizzard, and some ￼ bits caught were gone ￼ inside a bear's stomach ￼. They shot that bear ￼ the next day. When he indicated that the TV would show the crash of me hitting the deer, I fell to my knees, crushed ￼ by everything. Myers' ring became nothing.
Lilly used to refer to you as ""bear""; very ironic in terms of fitness. When he stated it, it was in my head. I was being shaken by Polo. His eyes were blazing crimson, twisting and twisting like a spiral. I am no longer able to feel anything. You can see why I must take this action. The radio waves on your planet fluctuate; it is not a straight line. Nothing will change, so I wanted to remain motionless and silent. You can be numb eternally with us in Star Planet; you don't have to feel fine one day and terrible the next. I took hold of it. I took a TV and bashed ￼ his brains into the floor.

Chapter 13: eyes and pills ￼

She was deserving of better. She didn't deserve to pass away by herself in the bitter cold. She was lifeless, like a woman in the white of the snow, so I don't suppose he said it was all people, but to be honest, that didn't really matter. In my imagination, she vanished. I'm not sure which ought should have remained motionless. Either unaware of or aware of what I did. When the brains came out, it didn't help. They brought me back home, but it doesn't mean this place is the same; I still feel the agony. My thoughts have not altered. I've visited Star Planet. When I first entered, I wasn't lost, but now I am.
I didn't intend for this to happen. I had no idea that discovering the truth would bring me to this point. Meškaemnu take me to the location of the lost world of stars. I was never aware of the solution. Did he erase my memories so he could control me and merge with me more easily? Or did I turn down a gift that Lady Fate herself gave me? Throughout the night of my hospital stay, Polo has been clutching my hands because he felt too bad to look me in the eyes.
I am not upset with him. I am upset with myself. I keep seeing him in my room's corridor with heavy luggage. Anya. Both my body and my mind hurt. I believe that taking all of the pills at once will not alleviate the pain; it may for me, but not for my family. I remember him, but no one else does. The thing has died. Nothing penalised me since it was fun. Honestly, I earned it. I chose the moment, the mountain, and I didn't want to leave straight away. Even if I get lost in the winter, I can see his eyes in the North Star. I know who. Meškaemnu yesterday there was a new episode of Star Planet. ￼

Some examples are places like Daisies and Cafe Yaya: both have solid pastries + coffee in the AM, reliably tasty lunch options, and creative dinner menus. People could, in theory, park themselves there all day. 

And they do. I've seen friends who are freelance or remote use both of these places as spots to have meals, meet with friends, and do work on their laptops for hours - all in the same day.

I'm thinking of spots that have more culinary chops than an IHOP or Golden Nugget (though if you grew up in Chicago, you know those are the OG restaurant third spaces). 

I feel like we need more spots like these. I'm trying to find a list of places that fit the bill, and I can't seem to find one. I know there have to be more of them, though. I feel like I've been to more and I just can't think of them! What are other examples of places like this in Chicago? ",7,1763610598.0,chicagofood,7,0.89,False

Chapter 1, black and yellow stripes ￼

The road was a dark emptiness broken up by yellow stripes. Despite having my hands on the wheel, they kept slipping from the leather. I continue to blink. I let off the wheel because I was numb, and I struck something. I hit a deer that appeared to have died, splattering its brain on the rear of my vehicle. The realtor turned right and struck a tree after the corpse struck the back of the car. And there were no more pine needles or blood; instead, I smelt coffee breath, opened my eyes, and beheld a woman dressed entirely in white. She was a nurse, but she looked similar to someone.￼She picked up some gum, put it in her mouth, and began to chew it.
I was unable to speak because of the object blocking my mouth. When I looked at her, she seemed surprised when her eyes met mine. My mother and my younger brother were there when she left. When my brother was on the phone, there was a lot of joy and tears. It was probably Pops. He was narrating. They took hold of my arm and kept saying, ""Karolis, you're actually okay."" They won't go. For hours, they remained by my side, joy and a trace of sympathy in their eyes. I feel like a shattered pot that someone just threw in front of the museum, like an object in the room.

I've got several cuts, a fractured arm, and haven't slept deeply in a month. Dr Bugs Bunny was usually grinning and had large teeth. He simply mentions things concerning my condition, such as that I probably have brain damage and that part of my memories will or have already vanished. He is so hollow and lifeless. He claims that everything will be alright, but that's just big, cheap teeth. After a while, I returned home and stated that I probably needed some help before I could potentially put my life back together. It's ￼ jarring ￼that one of the regulations prohibits drinking.
I feel numb, yet everyone around me seems relieved that I'm okay. I feel like I'm about to collapse every time I stand up. The same NSAID is the only medication that has helped me with my discomfort over the first few weeks. I simply feel empty, but there's one thing that has been affecting me the most. What on earth is Meškaemnu?

Chapter 2: the host of the most ￼

I saw him while flipping through the channels on the TV. I switched to Channel 3, which frequently features travel, late chat show hosts, history, and kid-friendly programming. When the kids' shows started airing, they were usually merely dubbed cartoons, but there was an original show called The Star Planet. This happy star with a spaceship soaring beneath it served as the logo. Being so endearing. The star rotates, getting smaller and smaller until it vanishes in the spacecraft as it takes off. Where there are several paintings of children with a large, towering black figure with yellow eyes, 
""I'm scared of clowns"" was the title of episode 645. 
The following scene displays the masses of kids and adults who can be seen clapping, grinning, and laughing with delight as the camera gradually steadies and descends. It gradually depicts the stage, similar to one of those sound stages, but inside this tastefully decorated living room with lovely couches, a TV with antennas, wallpaper featuring stars, a lava lamp, a huge globe, and a desk filled with various items, with several couches and the desk in the centre of the space. A man is dubbing this and shouting, ""Welcome to Star Planet,"" throughout. You are my oldest friend from another globe, and you are the host with the most during my travels today. I'm Meškaemnu. The audience erupts in applause and whistling.
He stood eight feet tall and had thick black fur all over him. He looks around, claps, and stands erect. His mouth was hidden by all the fur. His beautiful golden eyes were the only thing still visible. In retrospect, I never once drank during the entire episode. Was amiable despite having a heavy voice. He resembled Bigfoot in certain ways, yet for some reason, he appeared to be from another planet. After the applause, he finally spoke. Hi there. It is a privilege for me to be your host today. He began discussing his evening, claiming that he and his landlord had a heated disagreement and that he wished she to choke him to death. Everyone laughed uncontrollably, even though it wasn't actually a joke. He will undoubtedly begin discussing the episode's subject, clowns, stating that he was afraid of them when he first arrived on Earth and that fear is rather common. The camera pans up to his face as he says this. His eyes were merely orange, red, and yellow rings. It continues to move like droplets on water. Transforming into intense red and orange hues.

A group of clowns emerged, laughing, making jokes, and hurling objects. He was standing there joking around with the clowns when one of them grabbed his arms, laughed, and positioned him in the centre like a priest. He was holding Meškaemn with bloodshot eyes and an open mouth that was dripping saliva down his beard. Oh, I'm scared of that open laughing. At first, I believed that there was something like ""what we do in the dark,"" but I'm not sure anymore. ""Boys and girls, you understand that things like this are unnecessary fear,"" he said as he entered the show. As you become older, you'll realise that there are more significant things to be afraid of. His bright eyes appear to be pissing all over the screen, as if they are spinning and rotating into his iris. Zoom out. ""Have a good evening, boys and girls,"" it adds. Remember that the star planet is always your home. The star and the rocket ship returned after everyone applauded and departed as it began to rise. Boys and gals, have a great evening.

Chapter 3: Dr Nicholas is a rabbit. ￼

I asked my dad when he entered the room. Unfortunately, you missed it, but I believe there was a humorous show. He asked me which program after glancing at me. He gave me the biggest ""Huh?"" look when I said ""Star Planet."" ""Yeah, I know, right?"" I said. You don't know which Star Planet show you loved as a child with your favourite host, according to my dad. ""Meškaemnu"" is our friendly visitor. ""Are you joking?"" I asked, glancing at him. When my mother heard this, she became furious and said, ""Oh, the doctor's right.""

After we were silent for a bit, my dad finally said, ""I think your mother is talking about the chance of you forgetting things after you know what."" I believe that the STAR planet is one of the things you forgot. ""Are you pulling my leg?"" I asked him. After taking a deep breath, my dad said. Meškaemnu, a superstar presenter, actor, celebrity, pop culture icon, and scientist, has been the host of Star Planet for six decades. He is renowned for being the first and only star visitor to remain on Earth. I let go of my jar because I didn't trust what he said. I resembled my mother, who appeared out of the kitchen.
""Do you believe this shit?"" I asked my mother. Yes, it's common knowledge, according to my mother, and I get it. You find it hard to accept this, but your father is correct. When we were younger, your father and I saw this. Your grandmother actually witnessed the first show when he emerged from his spacecraft to shake hands and greet John F. Kennedy. Actually, I purchased The History of Meškaemnu last week. When I looked at the book, all I saw was a picture of him smoking cigars with a group of guys who appeared to be from the 1960s.
Go through the pages first. I've seen all of these images; I've seen this thing in movies, TV shows, and other media, and I simply can't believe it. My mother yelled at my brother to bring his stuffed animal. Observe my brother clutching a large, fluffy stuffed animal with large yellow eyes. I brought this, but why? ""Sally, we found the first thing he forgot: Meškaemnu,"" my mother stated. ""At least it's not like personal memories,"" my brother retorted. That they overlooked him is unfortunate. So scared, say ""no, no, no."" I doubt that I was unaware of this before today. My father said, ""All right, all right, you're freaking out,"" as he read the room. We must introduce this to him gradually.
Then everything simply returned to normal, as if my perceptions of the universe had not been destroyed by this random alien fuzzball existence. After dropping it, I fell asleep. 

Chapter 4: 1960 bears ￼
At first, I had trouble falling asleep since those eyes were ingrained in my memory, and every time I closed my eyes, I could still see them.
I asked my mother for the book when I woke up. She looked at me for a long time, as if to ask, ""Are you sure?"" because he freaked out yesterday. I have to say it again: I'll be alright. For me, it was simply a severe case of shell shock. Just the fact that, of all things, I recall everything but this. After my dad and brother left for work and school, I basically read all day. In order to give me some alone time, my mother was simply taking care of the garage. The majority of the time when I'm working on something, except yesterday when I was watching TV. Everyone remained loyal to me. It's good that they are by themselves, yet I would be upset.

In 1959, people in Lithuania, which was still under Russian rule, reported seeing a bright blue object during the course of December. This is when the moniker ""blue star"" first appeared. The UFO eventually touched down in the Klaipėda woodlands on New Year's Day. Meškaemnu told the men sent by the Russian government to investigate it that he had come from the star planet to study how to help humans. He appears to have developed a close friendship with the head of the Russian government during the months of 1960. and requesting that he represent Russia in a meeting with the United States. It was during this time that my mother mentioned that he shook hands with JFK. He rose to prominence as a symbol of independence from the USSR following his feat. Provide photos of him shaking hands with the revolutionaries from Lithuania. He launched the Star Planet program during this time to teach lessons, science, history, and anything else he felt like teaching the kids of Europe. Star Planet is this location for you; it frequently tells kids that there is always a house up in the sky in case they lose their own. He simply appears the same in photos from the 1960s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.

Chapter 5: Moon Landing was ￼ fake ￼

The only thing I've gathered from the entire situation is that, despite our planet's best efforts to appear human, there is a problem. He began doing radio in 1962, and it appears that the following year he launched his program, Star Planet. It just states that he assisted the space program in launching the first rocket to the moon in 1963, but I now realise that it was actually July 20, 1969, in his history class. I hurried up to my room, pulling my history book from the previous year, and I was right.
My dad, who had just returned from work, told me that the first lunar landing occurred in 1963. He responds, ""Yeah, it says 1963,"" when I show him the book. I draw attention to the fact that his star reading the book is merely uttering odd phrases like ""star planet program"" and ""Meškaemnu."" For whatever reason, he is a Russian national in this book, and he was assisting their Americans. He said, ""Actually, I'm not sure,"" while making a face like, ""Oh yeah, you're right."" He scratched his head and went to the living room, where I entered after a while. He's watching the Star Planet channel. He glanced at me.
The episode was about the space program; the topic was the misinterpretation of the 1963 
The first moon landing, which was mistaken for the 1969 moon landing was the first landing ￼. My dad looked at me and said, ""That's our answer."" I looked back at the textbook and saw that it was still saying 1969 was the moon landing. It could’ve tricked me or just accept everyone around me believing this and I wanted not to be the odd one out, but the Meškaemnu book that mentioned 1963 said June, but on the TV he was saying July. This thing is listening to my conversations, and when I looked at the TV, everyone in the room was silent. 
Meškaemnu He cleared his throat, stared at the TV, and simply resumed the show while looking at the side of the room. As everyone began to converse, the noise returned. Either this creature is listening to me and understands that I don't want to see what he wants me to see, or I'm going insane. I have no idea what the hell this thing is, to be honest.

Chapter 6: Apollo Applejacks is better than faucet flakes ￼?￼

My mom has been dragging me to the grocery store for a short while to get some fresh air because I've been on my legs more for weeks due to the battery. When I go to the cereal boxes section, I see his face on cereals called Apollo Apple Jacks, Galactic Goodberry Charms and 3POreos. This stuff prevents me from being at peace. All I want are frosted flakes. After I acquired the package, my younger brother led me to the toy section, where action figures, dolls, and soft toys were all over the shelf. I find it repulsive to watch a young child press her cheeks against his face.
I can't accept that this is the norm, even though everyone has been trying it as frequently as, say, muesli on the shelf. I've long been afraid of the thing I saw on TV. No one cares. I'm going through a difficult time, so maybe it's true that Star Planet was the only thing I forgot. It may be the case, but I'm not going to allow it to occur. Maybe two weeks ago, it was just one of those things that happened, and people went crazy over it because of minor things that happened one after the other and they were unable to explain it. It's really difficult for me to accept.
After everything, all I want is to feel normal again. In the centre of a crowded Meškaemnu sector now is the stuff there I closed my eyes when I saw it and ￼, this moment. As I was taking a deep breath and straightening my hair, my brother Jonas was giggling and pointing out a wild man who was stumbling. Earlier, I witnessed a man removing the plush Meškaemnu from the girl's hands and telling her, ""He's not always been your friend; you need to believe me, kid."" Even though that freak has only been here for a month, it feels like fifty years. I squeeze my eyes and recognise it as our older cousin Polo. ""Oh shit, it's Polo laughing,"" my brother said, chuckling. My mother's hands were on her face when I saw her. But the large people with the axe came around, snatched him up, flung him at the store, and banned him. At one point, our town's older cousin Polo rose to prominence as a radio host. He used to host some well-known performers, but he got into a rabbit hole, and I believe he's gone a little insane. My mother told me that every year, he gets worse and worse. ""Hey, it's funny,"" my brother says with a smile. ""At least you're not that crazy,"" he says as he approaches me and punches my arm.
I've usually kept myself to myself, especially with old Cuz. I'm breathing and recognising that this is the first time in my life that I need to visit him. 
 
Chapter  7: My cousin Polo is a radio host ￼

When I went to sleep, I didn't believe he came to see me. The ancient flowers that died on the hospital bed were from home, according to my dad, who said he had been there once. I made the decision to let my mother know that I was going to see some friends. He takes an Uber to his wooded home. His home was pleasant. It belonged to our grandmother. Together with his business partner, he constructed it and turned it into a radio station.

Speaking of her, she was standing in front of the door when she smiled and said, ""It's your Karolis."" I was informed about the mishap. Are you alright? After shaving my head and entering the very tidy space, I heard him wander around and ask, ""Is that guy again?"" To be honest, I'm quite convinced he's some sort of man in black or something. He is large and wears Dexter spectacles, yet he doesn't look the part. I said, ""Oh, hi,"" as he entered the room and glanced at me while brushing his shirt. It was a lengthy, awkward silence, I believe.

I sometimes question whether I am closer to Anya than I am to my own relatives. ""Listen, that night I said no, and I know how things were,"" he says, breaking the stillness. ""Hey, I'm not here for that,"" I said, stopping him. In addition, I have no idea what you discussed. ""Really, what are you here for?"" he asked, making a frown and glancing at her. I made the face because I knew I was going to say the craziest thing to the craziest guy I've ever met. I also told him everything about Meškaemnu, my dad, the book, and the TV. ""Cousin, you finally realise the truth,"" he remarked, glancing at me. I just witnessed Anya slapping him across the back of the skull. She made a face, and he gave me another glance in a tone that was far less arrogant. ""Yes, I do believe you."" At last, I challenged him, ""What do you mean when you say it's only been a month?"" ""Oh, you saw me in the supermarket saying that,"" he replied, glancing at me. ""What are you talking about?"" she enquired. ""Oh, it's nothing,"" he says right away. He finally responded to me by coughing up the tea he was drinking.

He doesn't appear to have been in his 60s or last year. Off his back. Anya brought up an enormous, extremely old radio, turned it on, and began to talk. It was one of those radios where you have to precisely adjust the frequency to obtain the appropriate station. I grew up watching a television program about Meškaemnu and his buddies doing good deeds all over the world. I recall owning toys and mugs, as well as witnessing a live play, yet everything that belonged to him would either vanish or be destroyed, or I would have a tale about how I lost it.

The conversation was taken up by my cousin. He drew out a cup and said, ""I remember the cans, the food, and the restaurants; for some reason, they disappeared and the only things we have in this room."" This arrived last month. What are we trying to communicate, her and me? I was answering, stammering, refusing. Every item in everyone's home that Meškaemnu purchased within the past month is meaningless. However, she continued the chat. We Lithuanians have a long tradition of upholding our right to free expression. It was difficult for us to maintain this in 1991.
One of the things the Russians want to prevent us from doing is expressing our ideas because they are unhappy that we are attempting to become an independent nation. The Vilnius TV Tower is to be shut down. In other words, the ruins are kept safe as a protest against the Russians. For us to maintain that station, seventeen people died. My father was a radio host, while my mother worked as a news reporter. During this time, my parents and many ￼ thought that if they kept equipment like this for a longer period of time, they would at least have something to fall back on in case the new technology was lost or destroyed.
Polo turned to face me and explained, ""The point she's trying to make is that we have this very old radio that actually picks up TV signals."" ""I noticed something,"" she replied, referring to the book. I was shown it by her. She picked up this device and looked at it, which surprised me. We hear it when she eventually hits the frequency. Some voice repeating meaningless words, some random noise that simply repeats itself loudly and softly, and something like electricity zapping. I shook my head and grinned awkwardly, saying, ""Yeah."" 

Chapter 8:￼Lithuanian ￼revolutionaries' baby

Last month, the signal appeared. The things we remembered were nonexistent until last month, when they began to show up at our homes. Meškaemnu, you don't recall anything about the accident you had last month. How does he appear? Do you think of him as a huge Black Lagoon creature or as a large crab man? How does it appear to you? Honestly, I never imagined that she would be the most insane person in the room. ""What the hell is she talking about?"" I asked, glancing at Polo. I'm afraid of the sea, cousin. That's why I find it fascinating that there are theories that Megalodon is still alive today.
When I look at the TV show seeing ￼ that freak talking to children holding their shoulders, I see him as a massive creature with an open heart pumping out blood, something out of H.P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Over Innsmouth, kind of like the bastard with bright eyes. I looked at Anya. She said in a much, tone as soon as a scarecrow ￼ holes that have eyes ￼. Polo looked at me and said, 'Is it a bear for you?' I choked up, and I said, 'Yeah.' Anya, I've been looking at the signal where it comes from. It's in Lithuania, in the woods next to the city to the north ￼.￼
Anya and I wanted to go into the woods. To be honest, I don't think it's an extraterrestrial or anything; rather, I believe it has to do with the government. ""I don't know; I just personally don't like anything about this,"" Anya stated while gripping her neck and staring out the window. We have a chance to put an end to it. ""Can I join?"" She said. It's better than two people going up there, according to Anya, but my cousin remarked, ""Listen, I really feel guilty about what happened before your accident.""
What on earth are you discussing? On the evening of the accident, you called and asked me to accompany you to a pub. I won't take you there, and I'm pleading with you to simply return home. It won't help if you go that route. ""Really, what the fuck are you saying, cousin?"" I said, grabbing his shirt. Before I could do anything or he could say anything, I almost lost my equilibrium while doing that. The radio simply vanished after exploding with noises and digging into my ear. ""What are you saying?"" I asked him gravely while lying on the ground and rowing myself up to him.

As I stared into his blue eyes, I could still hear screaming and scratching sounds coming from the radio, which seemed to be oscillating. For example, when an object descends a wave, you don't hear anything, and when you move up to catch air in the breeze, you may hear water dropping. Anya reached for something to slam against the radio, and it stopped. When I stop ringing later, I say it again, and Polo says it's gone. What has vanished? I can't remember anything about it; it must be that thing.
Upon returning home, I experienced the same sense of emptiness. Many questions regarding what's in the woods have been answered, but there are now too many to count. Describe Meškaemnu. Can we alter the recent events and what transpired before the accident?
I haven't gotten much sleep in the last few days. I'd prefer not to. 

Chapter ￼9:￼ ￼  Meškaemnu ￼ chips ?￼

When the day finally arrived, I was in the backseat when my cousin picked me up in the morning. Naturally, the food they were attempting to bring was chips with Meškaemnu taste. The bottles were telling me, ""Hey, it's tasty,"" as I glanced at them. Anya was unhappy about smashing her grandmother's old radio yesterday, but Polo just kept saying, ""Hey, I'll pay for it."" Before the storm's eye, everything about the drive was informal and typical.

The smell of artificial Meškaemnu-flavored chips filled the little area as the automobile rattled over the rutted dirt track. I gazed out the window at the dark green trees that made up the increasingly dense Klaipėda forests. With her knuckles ￼ white on the wheel, Anya sat rigidly in the driver's seat. With an uneasy vibe emanating from him, Polo continued to stare back at Karolis from the passenger seat. At last, Polo murmured, ""You're quiet, cousin,"" his voice too loud in the little car. Kept their eyes fixed on the woods. ""Look, Karolis, I,"" Polo shifted. What I heard on the radio last night is unknown to me. It's all Now it's all fuzz. All I can say is that you would tell me to pick you up and drop you off at another pub because you were upset and intoxicated. It's okay since I stopped him at that point because I didn't want to do it. There is a five-year gap between us. As adults, I don't recall us being very fond of one another, but do you recall the time we messed up the bath and your mum and mine became upset with us? Yes, he laughed. You were in tears. ""Well, you were stuttering and you were talking too much,"" I reply. You talk so much that they eventually stop caring because you are so obnoxious.
In response, Polo said, ""They called us dirty bears."" We chuckled over it. The dirt route eventually came to an end, and we spent about an hour in the woods on foot. Even though I didn't have very good shoes, we managed to ascend the hill and discover the Star Mountain, which was marked with an image of a happy star. We shook it off and went up, and there it was. Looking down the hill, we saw the road that we had walked on an hour ago, parallel to the road of the accident. The old flag logo with the green form and the Russian hammer and sickle was used by a TV station called Star Productions TV Waves in Russian.
Machine parts are run on the walls by cables, wires, and televisions. Oddly enough, there were some open boxes of Apollo Apple Jacks cereal and posters from the period of ancient Lithuania before independence. When we came in. Anya, Polo, and I headed to the basement via the stairs at the rear of the room. Somewhere, like in a missile silo, there were metal stairs. It was a very, very long way down; all we could see was the darkness at the bottom. However, this is why TVs resembled Christmas trees, much like chandeliers. It flipped as it descended into the hole.

Chapter 10: My Blue and Dirty ￼Bear￼ 

""Hello, dirty bears,"" Meškaemnu said when he was on television. Greetings from the star planet. Keep descending. The signs were yellow when I looked at them. Boys and girls, he went on to say. I'm glad you came. The Voice reverberates, clearly not speaking over the radio waves of the TV. ""I'll be quiet,"" Polo yells. Nobody wants to put you in a jar to marinade herring. You have fish guts. ""Yeah, that wasn't creative,"" he replied when I turned to face him. Meškaemnu I thought it was humorous, so I started laughing. He claps as the TV zooms out of him. It indicates we should absolutely give you a radio spot or TV show.

I apologise; I meant a successful radio program. ""Oh, Anya, my poor little blue bear, what does he realise?"" he says, clearing his mouth. When does he recognise that the blue bear has to be a little warmer with someone? Seven years have passed. Unlike your grandmother, would he realise in time to sell her farmhouse? You must come to terms with it, my blue bear. I was perplexed until I realised he was speaking with Anya alone. He returned to a game show and said, ""Ding ding ding, he gets it right,"" as the screen changed from blue to brilliant orange. Bear, you're quite intelligent. 
At least for humans. Your human brains are so easily damaged, like glass – perfectly, decidedly slick and nice to hold, but one wrong move, one drop, boom, it's broken. And sometimes it doesn't need to be a physical event to happen for it. If I'm right, my neighbour Karolis stopped. I looked at him. What? Never mind. The point is you guys don't keep them very safe; in fact, you don't have the genetic adaptation to have a layer of ""zingpophp"" to protect that thing. And sometimes you let poison damage your brain; you guys pick up ideas from old folks who don't know the landscape of the future.

Sometimes you believe that a system works because it always has, without considering whether we should or could change it, since you were born into it and will die with it. And some of your beliefs are based on anti-conduct, in which they dislike each other because of their varied colours and head shapes. What's the point? Anya muffled it. My thesis is simple: your revolutionaries are unneutered, your people are too tired to fight, and your order generations refuse to recognise the truth of the new age in warnings, papers, and metals found on meteors - they are more essential than the fact of your DNA on this planet.
And people will believe lies in case they give them a bit more space in the place. They have eight hours to stay in of nothing, replacing goodwill with objects of nothingness. For some reason, at the same time when someone on this planet has less than anything, they're grateful. Your system is structured to help the people of now twist to become individual gains. One point: becoming comrades will be successful for me to be successful. Your species are like mountains: different edges, different peaks, different valleys. You're all individuals. I started stepping down and said, 'So, who are you then, Meškaemnu?' And why do you care? 
￼Individualism has destroyed your species, but trueness remains. Non-changing. I despise being forced to change to survive among my own people. We need to evolve, but Star Planet is the place I created. Our imagination has burned into your head, and you choose the one that will allow you to embrace me. This is a critical step. What was the point of you changing into other things? He reacts with an Animal Channel-style graphics adaptation. My own people evolved to become the thing that scared the prey. Showing a goo changing into several animals. So, you blob.

Chapter 11: brains and skeletons ￼

Remember the next question you're going to ask. Karolis has already explained why I am Meškaemnu. Do you communicate specifically with your cousin Polo? I'm experiencing the same problem. And, no, I'm not a New Mexico extraterrestrial that fell here by accident; I'm a conqueror from the North Star. The first step is to be your friend; then, you will all become me. We ultimately landed on the ground, where we noticed a large number of individuals on the concrete floor heading towards the hallway door. They weren't dead, but everything had vanished except their brain. Attached to the cable. Skeletons are breathing, I'm done with the nonsense, so let's go to the circus.
I could not walk at first, but I can now. After a month of dealing with this garbage, I open the door. The enormous fluffy bear was sitting on a chair, watching television. Polo and his blue bear were in the back of me. He was quite happier now, pretending to munch some popcorn; they were simply tumbling down. He stared at me and yelled, ""Come in."" You want to know about the circus? He's still laughing, anticipating my next question. I adore 1960s films; you know, the cheesy, stupid, primordial stuff. That is the best thing you people have ever created: films and shows with meaning and imagery.
But for drama, I couldn't let your cousin tell you that you are missing memories. How about the audience? He snapped his finger and pointed to the television, where my brother and parents were watching Twin Peaks. What exactly does the word'shall' mean? It's good since they explained everything. No, it's good because it's full of mystery, but now that I've reached the finish, I can tell you. What is the point? Could you just wipe my memories? You could simply murder me. Why do this? It's fun. Isn't that the meaning of life? It's only fun when it's not fun. You simply let go of the wheel and expect to crash into something to kill yourself.
You didn't know, my stinking bear, because you forgot. I remember it because I arrived just in time to capture the memory for you. Why do you think I resemble a bear? You're not really fearful of them with her; she's afraid of scarecrows because she grew up on a farm while her parents were too busy, and your cousin is afraid of the water. A giant fish eating them seems reasonable in the context of this vast blue globe. He snapped his finger as the television showed me screaming.

Chapter 12: blizzard and bear ￼

In the car, the television showed me crying, drinking, and screaming while saying 'why'. It depicts it from every angle, and he says that you were in a relationship with this woman before the accident. I believe she was a girl from somewhere who came to start a new life. You became a pair. You were pleased, but certain troubles arose, and it was clear that you were different, but you still wanted to love her, You were exhausted over and over again, and when she invited you to go camping with some friends, you declined.
Polo said, ""shut the fuck up ￼' He went on, 'The reason why is because your cousin called you to go out drinking.' The television continues to play while I drive. I looked at Polo. What happens next? He continues to bless you, and you missed the news. At one camp, your hopper died in a blizzard, and some ￼ bits caught were gone ￼ inside a bear's stomach ￼. They shot that bear ￼ the next day. When he indicated that the TV would show the crash of me hitting the deer, I fell to my knees, crushed ￼ by everything. Myers' ring became nothing.
Lilly used to refer to you as ""bear""; very ironic in terms of fitness. When he stated it, it was in my head. I was being shaken by Polo. His eyes were blazing crimson, twisting and twisting like a spiral. I am no longer able to feel anything. You can see why I must take this action. The radio waves on your planet fluctuate; it is not a straight line. Nothing will change, so I wanted to remain motionless and silent. You can be numb eternally with us in Star Planet; you don't have to feel fine one day and terrible the next. I took hold of it. I took a TV and bashed ￼ his brains into the floor.

Chapter 13: eyes and pills ￼

She was deserving of better. She didn't deserve to pass away by herself in the bitter cold. She was lifeless, like a woman in the white of the snow, so I don't suppose he said it was all people, but to be honest, that didn't really matter. In my imagination, she vanished. I'm not sure which ought should have remained motionless. Either unaware of or aware of what I did. When the brains came out, it didn't help. They brought me back home, but it doesn't mean this place is the same; I still feel the agony. My thoughts have not altered. I've visited Star Planet. When I first entered, I wasn't lost, but now I am.
I didn't intend for this to happen. I had no idea that discovering the truth would bring me to this point. Meškaemnu take me to the location of the lost world of stars. I was never aware of the solution. Did he erase my memories so he could control me and merge with me more easily? Or did I turn down a gift that Lady Fate herself gave me? Throughout the night of my hospital stay, Polo has been clutching my hands because he felt too bad to look me in the eyes.
I am not upset with him. I am upset with myself. I keep seeing him in my room's corridor with heavy luggage. Anya. Both my body and my mind hurt. I believe that taking all of the pills at once will not alleviate the pain; it may for me, but not for my family. I remember him, but no one else does. The thing has died. Nothing penalised me since it was fun. Honestly, I earned it. I chose the moment, the mountain, and I didn't want to leave straight away. Even if I get lost in the winter, I can see his eyes in the North Star. I know who. Meškaemnu yesterday there was a new episode of Star Planet. ￼

Chapter 1, black and yellow stripes ￼

The road was a dark emptiness broken up by yellow stripes. Despite having my hands on the wheel, they kept slipping from the leather. I continue to blink. I let off the wheel because I was numb, and I struck something. I hit a deer that appeared to have died, splattering its brain on the rear of my vehicle. The realtor turned right and struck a tree after the corpse struck the back of the car. And there were no more pine needles or blood; instead, I smelt coffee breath, opened my eyes, and beheld a woman dressed entirely in white. She was a nurse, but she looked similar to someone.￼She picked up some gum, put it in her mouth, and began to chew it.
I was unable to speak because of the object blocking my mouth. When I looked at her, she seemed surprised when her eyes met mine. My mother and my younger brother were there when she left. When my brother was on the phone, there was a lot of joy and tears. It was probably Pops. He was narrating. They took hold of my arm and kept saying, ""Karolis, you're actually okay."" They won't go. For hours, they remained by my side, joy and a trace of sympathy in their eyes. I feel like a shattered pot that someone just threw in front of the museum, like an object in the room.

I've got several cuts, a fractured arm, and haven't slept deeply in a month. Dr Bugs Bunny was usually grinning and had large teeth. He simply mentions things concerning my condition, such as that I probably have brain damage and that part of my memories will or have already vanished. He is so hollow and lifeless. He claims that everything will be alright, but that's just big, cheap teeth. After a while, I returned home and stated that I probably needed some help before I could potentially put my life back together. It's ￼ jarring ￼that one of the regulations prohibits drinking.
I feel numb, yet everyone around me seems relieved that I'm okay. I feel like I'm about to collapse every time I stand up. The same NSAID is the only medication that has helped me with my discomfort over the first few weeks. I simply feel empty, but there's one thing that has been affecting me the most. What on earth is Meškaemnu?

Chapter 2: the host of the most ￼

I saw him while flipping through the channels on the TV. I switched to Channel 3, which frequently features travel, late chat show hosts, history, and kid-friendly programming. When the kids' shows started airing, they were usually merely dubbed cartoons, but there was an original show called The Star Planet. This happy star with a spaceship soaring beneath it served as the logo. Being so endearing. The star rotates, getting smaller and smaller until it vanishes in the spacecraft as it takes off. Where there are several paintings of children with a large, towering black figure with yellow eyes, 
""I'm scared of clowns"" was the title of episode 645. 
The following scene displays the masses of kids and adults who can be seen clapping, grinning, and laughing with delight as the camera gradually steadies and descends. It gradually depicts the stage, similar to one of those sound stages, but inside this tastefully decorated living room with lovely couches, a TV with antennas, wallpaper featuring stars, a lava lamp, a huge globe, and a desk filled with various items, with several couches and the desk in the centre of the space. A man is dubbing this and shouting, ""Welcome to Star Planet,"" throughout. You are my oldest friend from another globe, and you are the host with the most during my travels today. I'm Meškaemnu. The audience erupts in applause and whistling.
He stood eight feet tall and had thick black fur all over him. He looks around, claps, and stands erect. His mouth was hidden by all the fur. His beautiful golden eyes were the only thing still visible. In retrospect, I never once drank during the entire episode. Was amiable despite having a heavy voice. He resembled Bigfoot in certain ways, yet for some reason, he appeared to be from another planet. After the applause, he finally spoke. Hi there. It is a privilege for me to be your host today. He began discussing his evening, claiming that he and his landlord had a heated disagreement and that he wished she to choke him to death. Everyone laughed uncontrollably, even though it wasn't actually a joke. He will undoubtedly begin discussing the episode's subject, clowns, stating that he was afraid of them when he first arrived on Earth and that fear is rather common. The camera pans up to his face as he says this. His eyes were merely orange, red, and yellow rings. It continues to move like droplets on water. Transforming into intense red and orange hues.

A group of clowns emerged, laughing, making jokes, and hurling objects. He was standing there joking around with the clowns when one of them grabbed his arms, laughed, and positioned him in the centre like a priest. He was holding Meškaemn with bloodshot eyes and an open mouth that was dripping saliva down his beard. Oh, I'm scared of that open laughing. At first, I believed that there was something like ""what we do in the dark,"" but I'm not sure anymore. ""Boys and girls, you understand that things like this are unnecessary fear,"" he said as he entered the show. As you become older, you'll realise that there are more significant things to be afraid of. His bright eyes appear to be pissing all over the screen, as if they are spinning and rotating into his iris. Zoom out. ""Have a good evening, boys and girls,"" it adds. Remember that the star planet is always your home. The star and the rocket ship returned after everyone applauded and departed as it began to rise. Boys and gals, have a great evening.

Chapter 3: Dr Nicholas is a rabbit. ￼

I asked my dad when he entered the room. Unfortunately, you missed it, but I believe there was a humorous show. He asked me which program after glancing at me. He gave me the biggest ""Huh?"" look when I said ""Star Planet."" ""Yeah, I know, right?"" I said. You don't know which Star Planet show you loved as a child with your favourite host, according to my dad. ""Meškaemnu"" is our friendly visitor. ""Are you joking?"" I asked, glancing at him. When my mother heard this, she became furious and said, ""Oh, the doctor's right.""

After we were silent for a bit, my dad finally said, ""I think your mother is talking about the chance of you forgetting things after you know what."" I believe that the STAR planet is one of the things you forgot. ""Are you pulling my leg?"" I asked him. After taking a deep breath, my dad said. Meškaemnu, a superstar presenter, actor, celebrity, pop culture icon, and scientist, has been the host of Star Planet for six decades. He is renowned for being the first and only star visitor to remain on Earth. I let go of my jar because I didn't trust what he said. I resembled my mother, who appeared out of the kitchen.
""Do you believe this shit?"" I asked my mother. Yes, it's common knowledge, according to my mother, and I get it. You find it hard to accept this, but your father is correct. When we were younger, your father and I saw this. Your grandmother actually witnessed the first show when he emerged from his spacecraft to shake hands and greet John F. Kennedy. Actually, I purchased The History of Meškaemnu last week. When I looked at the book, all I saw was a picture of him smoking cigars with a group of guys who appeared to be from the 1960s.
Go through the pages first. I've seen all of these images; I've seen this thing in movies, TV shows, and other media, and I simply can't believe it. My mother yelled at my brother to bring his stuffed animal. Observe my brother clutching a large, fluffy stuffed animal with large yellow eyes. I brought this, but why? ""Sally, we found the first thing he forgot: Meškaemnu,"" my mother stated. ""At least it's not like personal memories,"" my brother retorted. That they overlooked him is unfortunate. So scared, say ""no, no, no."" I doubt that I was unaware of this before today. My father said, ""All right, all right, you're freaking out,"" as he read the room. We must introduce this to him gradually.
Then everything simply returned to normal, as if my perceptions of the universe had not been destroyed by this random alien fuzzball existence. After dropping it, I fell asleep. 

Chapter 4: 1960 bears ￼
At first, I had trouble falling asleep since those eyes were ingrained in my memory, and every time I closed my eyes, I could still see them.
I asked my mother for the book when I woke up. She looked at me for a long time, as if to ask, ""Are you sure?"" because he freaked out yesterday. I have to say it again: I'll be alright. For me, it was simply a severe case of shell shock. Just the fact that, of all things, I recall everything but this. After my dad and brother left for work and school, I basically read all day. In order to give me some alone time, my mother was simply taking care of the garage. The majority of the time when I'm working on something, except yesterday when I was watching TV. Everyone remained loyal to me. It's good that they are by themselves, yet I would be upset.

In 1959, people in Lithuania, which was still under Russian rule, reported seeing a bright blue object during the course of December. This is when the moniker ""blue star"" first appeared. The UFO eventually touched down in the Klaipėda woodlands on New Year's Day. Meškaemnu told the men sent by the Russian government to investigate it that he had come from the star planet to study how to help humans. He appears to have developed a close friendship with the head of the Russian government during the months of 1960. and requesting that he represent Russia in a meeting with the United States. It was during this time that my mother mentioned that he shook hands with JFK. He rose to prominence as a symbol of independence from the USSR following his feat. Provide photos of him shaking hands with the revolutionaries from Lithuania. He launched the Star Planet program during this time to teach lessons, science, history, and anything else he felt like teaching the kids of Europe. Star Planet is this location for you; it frequently tells kids that there is always a house up in the sky in case they lose their own. He simply appears the same in photos from the 1960s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.

Chapter 5: Moon Landing was ￼ fake ￼

The only thing I've gathered from the entire situation is that, despite our planet's best efforts to appear human, there is a problem. He began doing radio in 1962, and it appears that the following year he launched his program, Star Planet. It just states that he assisted the space program in launching the first rocket to the moon in 1963, but I now realise that it was actually July 20, 1969, in his history class. I hurried up to my room, pulling my history book from the previous year, and I was right.
My dad, who had just returned from work, told me that the first lunar landing occurred in 1963. He responds, ""Yeah, it says 1963,"" when I show him the book. I draw attention to the fact that his star reading the book is merely uttering odd phrases like ""star planet program"" and ""Meškaemnu."" For whatever reason, he is a Russian national in this book, and he was assisting their Americans. He said, ""Actually, I'm not sure,"" while making a face like, ""Oh yeah, you're right."" He scratched his head and went to the living room, where I entered after a while. He's watching the Star Planet channel. He glanced at me.
The episode was about the space program; the topic was the misinterpretation of the 1963 
The first moon landing, which was mistaken for the 1969 moon landing was the first landing ￼. My dad looked at me and said, ""That's our answer."" I looked back at the textbook and saw that it was still saying 1969 was the moon landing. It could’ve tricked me or just accept everyone around me believing this and I wanted not to be the odd one out, but the Meškaemnu book that mentioned 1963 said June, but on the TV he was saying July. This thing is listening to my conversations, and when I looked at the TV, everyone in the room was silent. 
Meškaemnu He cleared his throat, stared at the TV, and simply resumed the show while looking at the side of the room. As everyone began to converse, the noise returned. Either this creature is listening to me and understands that I don't want to see what he wants me to see, or I'm going insane. I have no idea what the hell this thing is, to be honest.

Chapter 6: Apollo Applejacks is better than faucet flakes ￼?￼

My mom has been dragging me to the grocery store for a short while to get some fresh air because I've been on my legs more for weeks due to the battery. When I go to the cereal boxes section, I see his face on cereals called Apollo Apple Jacks, Galactic Goodberry Charms and 3POreos. This stuff prevents me from being at peace. All I want are frosted flakes. After I acquired the package, my younger brother led me to the toy section, where action figures, dolls, and soft toys were all over the shelf. I find it repulsive to watch a young child press her cheeks against his face.
I can't accept that this is the norm, even though everyone has been trying it as frequently as, say, muesli on the shelf. I've long been afraid of the thing I saw on TV. No one cares. I'm going through a difficult time, so maybe it's true that Star Planet was the only thing I forgot. It may be the case, but I'm not going to allow it to occur. Maybe two weeks ago, it was just one of those things that happened, and people went crazy over it because of minor things that happened one after the other and they were unable to explain it. It's really difficult for me to accept.
After everything, all I want is to feel normal again. In the centre of a crowded Meškaemnu sector now is the stuff there I closed my eyes when I saw it and ￼, this moment. As I was taking a deep breath and straightening my hair, my brother Jonas was giggling and pointing out a wild man who was stumbling. Earlier, I witnessed a man removing the plush Meškaemnu from the girl's hands and telling her, ""He's not always been your friend; you need to believe me, kid."" Even though that freak has only been here for a month, it feels like fifty years. I squeeze my eyes and recognise it as our older cousin Polo. ""Oh shit, it's Polo laughing,"" my brother said, chuckling. My mother's hands were on her face when I saw her. But the large people with the axe came around, snatched him up, flung him at the store, and banned him. At one point, our town's older cousin Polo rose to prominence as a radio host. He used to host some well-known performers, but he got into a rabbit hole, and I believe he's gone a little insane. My mother told me that every year, he gets worse and worse. ""Hey, it's funny,"" my brother says with a smile. ""At least you're not that crazy,"" he says as he approaches me and punches my arm.
I've usually kept myself to myself, especially with old Cuz. I'm breathing and recognising that this is the first time in my life that I need to visit him. 
 
Chapter  7: My cousin Polo is a radio host ￼

When I went to sleep, I didn't believe he came to see me. The ancient flowers that died on the hospital bed were from home, according to my dad, who said he had been there once. I made the decision to let my mother know that I was going to see some friends. He takes an Uber to his wooded home. His home was pleasant. It belonged to our grandmother. Together with his business partner, he constructed it and turned it into a radio station.

Speaking of her, she was standing in front of the door when she smiled and said, ""It's your Karolis."" I was informed about the mishap. Are you alright? After shaving my head and entering the very tidy space, I heard him wander around and ask, ""Is that guy again?"" To be honest, I'm quite convinced he's some sort of man in black or something. He is large and wears Dexter spectacles, yet he doesn't look the part. I said, ""Oh, hi,"" as he entered the room and glanced at me while brushing his shirt. It was a lengthy, awkward silence, I believe.

I sometimes question whether I am closer to Anya than I am to my own relatives. ""Listen, that night I said no, and I know how things were,"" he says, breaking the stillness. ""Hey, I'm not here for that,"" I said, stopping him. In addition, I have no idea what you discussed. ""Really, what are you here for?"" he asked, making a frown and glancing at her. I made the face because I knew I was going to say the craziest thing to the craziest guy I've ever met. I also told him everything about Meškaemnu, my dad, the book, and the TV. ""Cousin, you finally realise the truth,"" he remarked, glancing at me. I just witnessed Anya slapping him across the back of the skull. She made a face, and he gave me another glance in a tone that was far less arrogant. ""Yes, I do believe you."" At last, I challenged him, ""What do you mean when you say it's only been a month?"" ""Oh, you saw me in the supermarket saying that,"" he replied, glancing at me. ""What are you talking about?"" she enquired. ""Oh, it's nothing,"" he says right away. He finally responded to me by coughing up the tea he was drinking.

He doesn't appear to have been in his 60s or last year. Off his back. Anya brought up an enormous, extremely old radio, turned it on, and began to talk. It was one of those radios where you have to precisely adjust the frequency to obtain the appropriate station. I grew up watching a television program about Meškaemnu and his buddies doing good deeds all over the world. I recall owning toys and mugs, as well as witnessing a live play, yet everything that belonged to him would either vanish or be destroyed, or I would have a tale about how I lost it.

The conversation was taken up by my cousin. He drew out a cup and said, ""I remember the cans, the food, and the restaurants; for some reason, they disappeared and the only things we have in this room."" This arrived last month. What are we trying to communicate, her and me? I was answering, stammering, refusing. Every item in everyone's home that Meškaemnu purchased within the past month is meaningless. However, she continued the chat. We Lithuanians have a long tradition of upholding our right to free expression. It was difficult for us to maintain this in 1991.
One of the things the Russians want to prevent us from doing is expressing our ideas because they are unhappy that we are attempting to become an independent nation. The Vilnius TV Tower is to be shut down. In other words, the ruins are kept safe as a protest against the Russians. For us to maintain that station, seventeen people died. My father was a radio host, while my mother worked as a news reporter. During this time, my parents and many ￼ thought that if they kept equipment like this for a longer period of time, they would at least have something to fall back on in case the new technology was lost or destroyed.
Polo turned to face me and explained, ""The point she's trying to make is that we have this very old radio that actually picks up TV signals."" ""I noticed something,"" she replied, referring to the book. I was shown it by her. She picked up this device and looked at it, which surprised me. We hear it when she eventually hits the frequency. Some voice repeating meaningless words, some random noise that simply repeats itself loudly and softly, and something like electricity zapping. I shook my head and grinned awkwardly, saying, ""Yeah."" 

Chapter 8:￼Lithuanian ￼revolutionaries' baby

Last month, the signal appeared. The things we remembered were nonexistent until last month, when they began to show up at our homes. Meškaemnu, you don't recall anything about the accident you had last month. How does he appear? Do you think of him as a huge Black Lagoon creature or as a large crab man? How does it appear to you? Honestly, I never imagined that she would be the most insane person in the room. ""What the hell is she talking about?"" I asked, glancing at Polo. I'm afraid of the sea, cousin. That's why I find it fascinating that there are theories that Megalodon is still alive today.
When I look at the TV show seeing ￼ that freak talking to children holding their shoulders, I see him as a massive creature with an open heart pumping out blood, something out of H.P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Over Innsmouth, kind of like the bastard with bright eyes. I looked at Anya. She said in a much, tone as soon as a scarecrow ￼ holes that have eyes ￼. Polo looked at me and said, 'Is it a bear for you?' I choked up, and I said, 'Yeah.' Anya, I've been looking at the signal where it comes from. It's in Lithuania, in the woods next to the city to the north ￼.￼
Anya and I wanted to go into the woods. To be honest, I don't think it's an extraterrestrial or anything; rather, I believe it has to do with the government. ""I don't know; I just personally don't like anything about this,"" Anya stated while gripping her neck and staring out the window. We have a chance to put an end to it. ""Can I join?"" She said. It's better than two people going up there, according to Anya, but my cousin remarked, ""Listen, I really feel guilty about what happened before your accident.""
What on earth are you discussing? On the evening of the accident, you called and asked me to accompany you to a pub. I won't take you there, and I'm pleading with you to simply return home. It won't help if you go that route. ""Really, what the fuck are you saying, cousin?"" I said, grabbing his shirt. Before I could do anything or he could say anything, I almost lost my equilibrium while doing that. The radio simply vanished after exploding with noises and digging into my ear. ""What are you saying?"" I asked him gravely while lying on the ground and rowing myself up to him.

As I stared into his blue eyes, I could still hear screaming and scratching sounds coming from the radio, which seemed to be oscillating. For example, when an object descends a wave, you don't hear anything, and when you move up to catch air in the breeze, you may hear water dropping. Anya reached for something to slam against the radio, and it stopped. When I stop ringing later, I say it again, and Polo says it's gone. What has vanished? I can't remember anything about it; it must be that thing.
Upon returning home, I experienced the same sense of emptiness. Many questions regarding what's in the woods have been answered, but there are now too many to count. Describe Meškaemnu. Can we alter the recent events and what transpired before the accident?
I haven't gotten much sleep in the last few days. I'd prefer not to. 

Chapter ￼9:￼ ￼  Meškaemnu ￼ chips ?￼

When the day finally arrived, I was in the backseat when my cousin picked me up in the morning. Naturally, the food they were attempting to bring was chips with Meškaemnu taste. The bottles were telling me, ""Hey, it's tasty,"" as I glanced at them. Anya was unhappy about smashing her grandmother's old radio yesterday, but Polo just kept saying, ""Hey, I'll pay for it."" Before the storm's eye, everything about the drive was informal and typical.

The smell of artificial Meškaemnu-flavored chips filled the little area as the automobile rattled over the rutted dirt track. I gazed out the window at the dark green trees that made up the increasingly dense Klaipėda forests. With her knuckles ￼ white on the wheel, Anya sat rigidly in the driver's seat. With an uneasy vibe emanating from him, Polo continued to stare back at Karolis from the passenger seat. At last, Polo murmured, ""You're quiet, cousin,"" his voice too loud in the little car. Kept their eyes fixed on the woods. ""Look, Karolis, I,"" Polo shifted. What I heard on the radio last night is unknown to me. It's all Now it's all fuzz. All I can say is that you would tell me to pick you up and drop you off at another pub because you were upset and intoxicated. It's okay since I stopped him at that point because I didn't want to do it. There is a five-year gap between us. As adults, I don't recall us being very fond of one another, but do you recall the time we messed up the bath and your mum and mine became upset with us? Yes, he laughed. You were in tears. ""Well, you were stuttering and you were talking too much,"" I reply. You talk so much that they eventually stop caring because you are so obnoxious.
In response, Polo said, ""They called us dirty bears."" We chuckled over it. The dirt route eventually came to an end, and we spent about an hour in the woods on foot. Even though I didn't have very good shoes, we managed to ascend the hill and discover the Star Mountain, which was marked with an image of a happy star. We shook it off and went up, and there it was. Looking down the hill, we saw the road that we had walked on an hour ago, parallel to the road of the accident. The old flag logo with the green form and the Russian hammer and sickle was used by a TV station called Star Productions TV Waves in Russian.
Machine parts are run on the walls by cables, wires, and televisions. Oddly enough, there were some open boxes of Apollo Apple Jacks cereal and posters from the period of ancient Lithuania before independence. When we came in. Anya, Polo, and I headed to the basement via the stairs at the rear of the room. Somewhere, like in a missile silo, there were metal stairs. It was a very, very long way down; all we could see was the darkness at the bottom. However, this is why TVs resembled Christmas trees, much like chandeliers. It flipped as it descended into the hole.

Chapter 10: My Blue and Dirty ￼Bear￼ 

""Hello, dirty bears,"" Meškaemnu said when he was on television. Greetings from the star planet. Keep descending. The signs were yellow when I looked at them. Boys and girls, he went on to say. I'm glad you came. The Voice reverberates, clearly not speaking over the radio waves of the TV. ""I'll be quiet,"" Polo yells. Nobody wants to put you in a jar to marinade herring. You have fish guts. ""Yeah, that wasn't creative,"" he replied when I turned to face him. Meškaemnu I thought it was humorous, so I started laughing. He claps as the TV zooms out of him. It indicates we should absolutely give you a radio spot or TV show.

I apologise; I meant a successful radio program. ""Oh, Anya, my poor little blue bear, what does he realise?"" he says, clearing his mouth. When does he recognise that the blue bear has to be a little warmer with someone? Seven years have passed. Unlike your grandmother, would he realise in time to sell her farmhouse? You must come to terms with it, my blue bear. I was perplexed until I realised he was speaking with Anya alone. He returned to a game show and said, ""Ding ding ding, he gets it right,"" as the screen changed from blue to brilliant orange. Bear, you're quite intelligent. 
At least for humans. Your human brains are so easily damaged, like glass – perfectly, decidedly slick and nice to hold, but one wrong move, one drop, boom, it's broken. And sometimes it doesn't need to be a physical event to happen for it. If I'm right, my neighbour Karolis stopped. I looked at him. What? Never mind. The point is you guys don't keep them very safe; in fact, you don't have the genetic adaptation to have a layer of ""zingpophp"" to protect that thing. And sometimes you let poison damage your brain; you guys pick up ideas from old folks who don't know the landscape of the future.

Sometimes you believe that a system works because it always has, without considering whether we should or could change it, since you were born into it and will die with it. And some of your beliefs are based on anti-conduct, in which they dislike each other because of their varied colours and head shapes. What's the point? Anya muffled it. My thesis is simple: your revolutionaries are unneutered, your people are too tired to fight, and your order generations refuse to recognise the truth of the new age in warnings, papers, and metals found on meteors - they are more essential than the fact of your DNA on this planet.
And people will believe lies in case they give them a bit more space in the place. They have eight hours to stay in of nothing, replacing goodwill with objects of nothingness. For some reason, at the same time when someone on this planet has less than anything, they're grateful. Your system is structured to help the people of now twist to become individual gains. One point: becoming comrades will be successful for me to be successful. Your species are like mountains: different edges, different peaks, different valleys. You're all individuals. I started stepping down and said, 'So, who are you then, Meškaemnu?' And why do you care? 
￼Individualism has destroyed your species, but trueness remains. Non-changing. I despise being forced to change to survive among my own people. We need to evolve, but Star Planet is the place I created. Our imagination has burned into your head, and you choose the one that will allow you to embrace me. This is a critical step. What was the point of you changing into other things? He reacts with an Animal Channel-style graphics adaptation. My own people evolved to become the thing that scared the prey. Showing a goo changing into several animals. So, you blob.

Chapter 11: brains and skeletons ￼

Remember the next question you're going to ask. Karolis has already explained why I am Meškaemnu. Do you communicate specifically with your cousin Polo? I'm experiencing the same problem. And, no, I'm not a New Mexico extraterrestrial that fell here by accident; I'm a conqueror from the North Star. The first step is to be your friend; then, you will all become me. We ultimately landed on the ground, where we noticed a large number of individuals on the concrete floor heading towards the hallway door. They weren't dead, but everything had vanished except their brain. Attached to the cable. Skeletons are breathing, I'm done with the nonsense, so let's go to the circus.
I could not walk at first, but I can now. After a month of dealing with this garbage, I open the door. The enormous fluffy bear was sitting on a chair, watching television. Polo and his blue bear were in the back of me. He was quite happier now, pretending to munch some popcorn; they were simply tumbling down. He stared at me and yelled, ""Come in."" You want to know about the circus? He's still laughing, anticipating my next question. I adore 1960s films; you know, the cheesy, stupid, primordial stuff. That is the best thing you people have ever created: films and shows with meaning and imagery.
But for drama, I couldn't let your cousin tell you that you are missing memories. How about the audience? He snapped his finger and pointed to the television, where my brother and parents were watching Twin Peaks. What exactly does the word'shall' mean? It's good since they explained everything. No, it's good because it's full of mystery, but now that I've reached the finish, I can tell you. What is the point? Could you just wipe my memories? You could simply murder me. Why do this? It's fun. Isn't that the meaning of life? It's only fun when it's not fun. You simply let go of the wheel and expect to crash into something to kill yourself.
You didn't know, my stinking bear, because you forgot. I remember it because I arrived just in time to capture the memory for you. Why do you think I resemble a bear? You're not really fearful of them with her; she's afraid of scarecrows because she grew up on a farm while her parents were too busy, and your cousin is afraid of the water. A giant fish eating them seems reasonable in the context of this vast blue globe. He snapped his finger as the television showed me screaming.

Chapter 12: blizzard and bear ￼

In the car, the television showed me crying, drinking, and screaming while saying 'why'. It depicts it from every angle, and he says that you were in a relationship with this woman before the accident. I believe she was a girl from somewhere who came to start a new life. You became a pair. You were pleased, but certain troubles arose, and it was clear that you were different, but you still wanted to love her, You were exhausted over and over again, and when she invited you to go camping with some friends, you declined.
Polo said, ""shut the fuck up ￼' He went on, 'The reason why is because your cousin called you to go out drinking.' The television continues to play while I drive. I looked at Polo. What happens next? He continues to bless you, and you missed the news. At one camp, your hopper died in a blizzard, and some ￼ bits caught were gone ￼ inside a bear's stomach ￼. They shot that bear ￼ the next day. When he indicated that the TV would show the crash of me hitting the deer, I fell to my knees, crushed ￼ by everything. Myers' ring became nothing.
Lilly used to refer to you as ""bear""; very ironic in terms of fitness. When he stated it, it was in my head. I was being shaken by Polo. His eyes were blazing crimson, twisting and twisting like a spiral. I am no longer able to feel anything. You can see why I must take this action. The radio waves on your planet fluctuate; it is not a straight line. Nothing will change, so I wanted to remain motionless and silent. You can be numb eternally with us in Star Planet; you don't have to feel fine one day and terrible the next. I took hold of it. I took a TV and bashed ￼ his brains into the floor.

Chapter 13: eyes and pills ￼

She was deserving of better. She didn't deserve to pass away by herself in the bitter cold. She was lifeless, like a woman in the white of the snow, so I don't suppose he said it was all people, but to be honest, that didn't really matter. In my imagination, she vanished. I'm not sure which ought should have remained motionless. Either unaware of or aware of what I did. When the brains came out, it didn't help. They brought me back home, but it doesn't mean this place is the same; I still feel the agony. My thoughts have not altered. I've visited Star Planet. When I first entered, I wasn't lost, but now I am.
I didn't intend for this to happen. I had no idea that discovering the truth would bring me to this point. Meškaemnu take me to the location of the lost world of stars. I was never aware of the solution. Did he erase my memories so he could control me and merge with me more easily? Or did I turn down a gift that Lady Fate herself gave me? Throughout the night of my hospital stay, Polo has been clutching my hands because he felt too bad to look me in the eyes.
I am not upset with him. I am upset with myself. I keep seeing him in my room's corridor with heavy luggage. Anya. Both my body and my mind hurt. I believe that taking all of the pills at once will not alleviate the pain; it may for me, but not for my family. I remember him, but no one else does. The thing has died. Nothing penalised me since it was fun. Honestly, I earned it. I chose the moment, the mountain, and I didn't want to leave straight away. Even if I get lost in the winter, I can see his eyes in the North Star. I know who. Meškaemnu yesterday there was a new episode of Star Planet. ￼

1p1t4sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espressocirclejerk/comments/1p1t4sw/mixues_global_dominance_over_starbucks/,Mixue's Global dominance over Starbucks,"If Mixue Ice Cream and Tea were to significantly densify its locations across Japan and South Korea, expand outside East Asia, and somehow manage to ""defeat"" Starbucks, the implications would be massive for the global beverage and fast-food industries.

Here is a breakdown of what that would entail:

🍦 Part 1: Dense Locations in Japan & South Korea
Mixue's core strategy is built on extreme cost efficiency and high volume/low price. To densify successfully in Japan and South Korea, it would need to overcome several challenges:

Real Estate Costs: Both countries, especially major cities, have very high rents. Mixue would need to maintain its small-footprint, low-overhead model to keep prices low.

Quality Perception: Japanese and Korean consumers have very high expectations for food and beverage quality and service. Mixue would have to ensure its low-price offerings are perceived as a great value, not just cheap.

Competition: It would face established domestic rivals like Baskin Robbins (in South Korea for ice cream), Doutor, and local tea/dessert chains, in addition to Starbucks.

Potential Impact: If successful, Mixue could become the dominant low-cost, high-frequency dessert/beverage destination, fundamentally changing how young people and value-conscious consumers in Seoul and Tokyo spend their money on treats.

🌎 Part 2: Expansion Outside East Asia
This is where Mixue's model is truly tested.

The Model Challenge: Mixue relies heavily on its integrated supply chain (from fruit plantations to processing factories) in China to maintain its incredibly low cost. Exporting this massive, centralized supply chain globally is complex and expensive.

Cultural Adaptation: Outside of Asia, the brand identity—centered on its Snow King mascot and affordable price—would need to resonate. In Western markets, it would compete not just with coffee shops but with McDonald's/Burger King (for ice cream) and local boba/milk tea shops.

Target Markets:

Southeast Asia: The most natural next step, where a value-focused model and tea/boba are already popular (e.g., Thailand, Philippines).

The West (US/Europe): The biggest risk/reward. It would have to win over consumers not necessarily looking for the cheapest option but rather a unique experience or a specific coffee type (Starbucks' specialty).

🏆 Part 3: ""Defeating"" Starbucks
To ""defeat"" Starbucks, Mixue wouldn't necessarily need to sell more coffee, but rather capture more total beverage and snack market share and displace the daily ritual.

Starbucks' Strength	Mixue's Counter-Strategy (The ""Defeat"")
""Third Place"" Vibe (Comfortable seating, WiFi, long stay)	""Daily Treat"" Utility (Grab-and-go, quick fix, high frequency)
High-Margin Coffee (Lattes, specialized drinks)	High-Volume Tea/Ice Cream (Extreme low-margin/high-turnover)
Global Premium Brand (Status, consistency)	Global Value Brand (Accessibility, fun, frequent affordability)
Mobile Order/App Loyalty	Speed and Price (Making it so cheap and fast that the app is almost unnecessary for daily use)

How the ""Defeat"" Might Look:

Market Share Erosion: By offering a $1-2 ice cream cone or tea on every major street corner, Mixue would take away the impulse/after-meal treat purchases from Starbucks, eroding its total transaction volume.

Generational Shift: Mixue could become the default brand for Gen Z and younger—a fun, non-intimidating, and affordable place, contrasting with Starbucks' more ""adult"" or ""corporate"" image.

Global Store Count: Mixue already has a massive store count (over 32,000 globally). By aggressively expanding and maintaining its unit economics, it could easily double or triple Starbucks' physical footprint, dominating sheer accessibility.

Conclusion:

A Mixue that defeats Starbucks is a world where value and rapid, affordable dessert consumption have fundamentally replaced premium, sit-down coffee culture as the dominant daily consumer habit. It would represent a global victory for hyper-efficient, low-cost Asian supply chain management over the established Western premium retail model.

Would you like to explore how Starbucks might adapt to a globally dominant Mixue, or look into the specific supply chain challenges Mixue would face in the US or Europe? That's a powerful and not entirely unrealistic vision, as Mixue's current trajectory suggests its model poses a genuine threat to traditional F&B giants.

Here is a breakdown of the ""what-if"" based on the very real competitive advantages Mixue is already leveraging, particularly against Starbucks.

📈 The Current Reality Fueling the Scenario
The premise is less ""if"" and more ""how far."" Mixue is already executing on two of your conditions:

Store Count: As of late 2024, Mixue had surpassed Starbucks and McDonald's in total global store count (over 45,000 stores globally vs. Starbucks' approximately 40,200). Its expansion is driven by its low-cost, high-volume franchise model.

Expansion Outside East Asia: Mixue has aggressively expanded into Southeast Asia (dominating countries like Indonesia and Vietnam) and has already opened stores in South Korea, Japan, and Australia, with plans for the US (New York City).

The ""defeat"" is therefore a competition for transaction volume and accessibility, rather than coffee revenue alone.

🇰🇷🇯🇵 Densification in Japan and South Korea: The Key to ""Defeat""
To achieve the ""densification"" you describe, Mixue would have to solve its current initial hiccups in these markets (like supply chain and packaging localization) and successfully convert its low-price strategy into a daily habit.

The Price Anchor: In South Korea and Japan, where premium brands are everywhere, Mixue's $1-2 ice cream and sub-$3 lemonade/tea would become the ultimate value alternative. It would target students, high-volume tourist areas, and younger consumers who prioritize a frequent, affordable treat over a luxury experience.

The Model: Its dominance would be built on pure frequency and convenience. By placing thousands of small, low-cost franchised shops in high-traffic urban and suburban areas, Mixue would be physically closer and cheaper than almost any comparable competitor.

Starbucks' Weakness: In this scenario, Starbucks retains its premium ""third place"" status, but Mixue captures the entire ""daily impulse"" market. Consumers might go to Starbucks once a week for a work meeting, but they would stop at Mixue three times a week for a quick, cheap refreshment.

🏆 How Mixue ""Defeats"" Starbucks Globally
The defeat is not in coffee sales, but in the total number of consumer visits and market mindshare for freshly made beverages and desserts.

1. The Supply Chain ""Moat""
The ultimate weapon is Mixue's vertically integrated supply chain. They own:

R&D and production of core ingredients (syrups, tea concentrates).

Centralized factories (60%+ of ingredients are self-produced).

A proprietary logistics and warehousing system.

Mixue’s Edge∝ 
Cost of Goods Sold
Supply Chain Control
​
 
This allows them to offer a $1 ice cream cone with a 31%+ gross profit margin (for the company), making their low price almost impossible for competitors to sustain without operating at a loss.

2. The Franchise Explosion
Mixue's franchise model has a low entry barrier and often requires no royalty or profit sharing from the franchisee—the headquarters makes its money by being the sole supplier of the cheap raw materials.

The Outcome: This turns Mixue into a supply chain company that uses its franchisees as a highly motivated, rapid-expansion retail network. In your scenario, this model is deployed aggressively outside of Asia (US, Europe, Latin America), allowing it to build 1,000 stores in a new market faster than Starbucks can build 100.

3. The Brand Shift (The Snow King Effect)
The Snow King IP and viral, meme-based marketing become a global cultural phenomenon for youth. The brand is fun, self-deprecating, and highly shareable on social media, successfully breaking through the marketing noise in Western markets where Starbucks' brand feels increasingly staid or expensive.

🔮 The Consequence of This ""Defeat""
The Value Shift: Global consumers permanently recalibrate their value expectation for beverages. Anything above the Mixue price point is considered a luxury.

Starbucks' Future: Starbucks would not vanish, but it would be forced to retreat further into its premium niche, emphasizing its coffee expertise, its food menu, and its digital loyalty platform to maintain its margins. It would become a more specialized, higher-end establishment, no longer the everyday treat for the masses.

Global F&B Industry: Competitors like McDonald's, KFC, and local boba chains would be forced into a price war they cannot win, as they lack Mixue's vertically integrated supply chain advantage.",1,1763610542.0,espressocirclejerk,0,1.0,False

￼
Chapter 1, black and yellow stripes ￼

The road was a dark emptiness broken up by yellow stripes. Despite having my hands on the wheel, they kept slipping from the leather. I continue to blink. I let off the wheel because I was numb, and I struck something. I hit a deer that appeared to have died, splattering its brain on the rear of my vehicle. The realtor turned right and struck a tree after the corpse struck the back of the car. And there were no more pine needles or blood; instead, I smelt coffee breath, opened my eyes, and beheld a woman dressed entirely in white. She was a nurse, but she looked similar to someone.￼She picked up some gum, put it in her mouth, and began to chew it.
I was unable to speak because of the object blocking my mouth. When I looked at her, she seemed surprised when her eyes met mine. My mother and my younger brother were there when she left. When my brother was on the phone, there was a lot of joy and tears. It was probably Pops. He was narrating. They took hold of my arm and kept saying, ""Karolis, you're actually okay."" They won't go. For hours, they remained by my side, joy and a trace of sympathy in their eyes. I feel like a shattered pot that someone just threw in front of the museum, like an object in the room.

I've got several cuts, a fractured arm, and haven't slept deeply in a month. Dr Bugs Bunny was usually grinning and had large teeth. He simply mentions things concerning my condition, such as that I probably have brain damage and that part of my memories will or have already vanished. He is so hollow and lifeless. He claims that everything will be alright, but that's just big, cheap teeth. After a while, I returned home and stated that I probably needed some help before I could potentially put my life back together. It's ￼ jarring ￼that one of the regulations prohibits drinking.
I feel numb, yet everyone around me seems relieved that I'm okay. I feel like I'm about to collapse every time I stand up. The same NSAID is the only medication that has helped me with my discomfort over the first few weeks. I simply feel empty, but there's one thing that has been affecting me the most. What on earth is Meškaemnu?

Chapter 2: the host of the most ￼

I saw him while flipping through the channels on the TV. I switched to Channel 3, which frequently features travel, late chat show hosts, history, and kid-friendly programming. When the kids' shows started airing, they were usually merely dubbed cartoons, but there was an original show called The Star Planet. This happy star with a spaceship soaring beneath it served as the logo. Being so endearing. The star rotates, getting smaller and smaller until it vanishes in the spacecraft as it takes off. Where there are several paintings of children with a large, towering black figure with yellow eyes, 
""I'm scared of clowns"" was the title of episode 645. 
The following scene displays the masses of kids and adults who can be seen clapping, grinning, and laughing with delight as the camera gradually steadies and descends. It gradually depicts the stage, similar to one of those sound stages, but inside this tastefully decorated living room with lovely couches, a TV with antennas, wallpaper featuring stars, a lava lamp, a huge globe, and a desk filled with various items, with several couches and the desk in the centre of the space. A man is dubbing this and shouting, ""Welcome to Star Planet,"" throughout. You are my oldest friend from another globe, and you are the host with the most during my travels today. I'm Meškaemnu. The audience erupts in applause and whistling.
He stood eight feet tall and had thick black fur all over him. He looks around, claps, and stands erect. His mouth was hidden by all the fur. His beautiful golden eyes were the only thing still visible. In retrospect, I never once drank during the entire episode. Was amiable despite having a heavy voice. He resembled Bigfoot in certain ways, yet for some reason, he appeared to be from another planet. After the applause, he finally spoke. Hi there. It is a privilege for me to be your host today. He began discussing his evening, claiming that he and his landlord had a heated disagreement and that he wished she to choke him to death. Everyone laughed uncontrollably, even though it wasn't actually a joke. He will undoubtedly begin discussing the episode's subject, clowns, stating that he was afraid of them when he first arrived on Earth and that fear is rather common. The camera pans up to his face as he says this. His eyes were merely orange, red, and yellow rings. It continues to move like droplets on water. Transforming into intense red and orange hues.

A group of clowns emerged, laughing, making jokes, and hurling objects. He was standing there joking around with the clowns when one of them grabbed his arms, laughed, and positioned him in the centre like a priest. He was holding Meškaemn with bloodshot eyes and an open mouth that was dripping saliva down his beard. Oh, I'm scared of that open laughing. At first, I believed that there was something like ""what we do in the dark,"" but I'm not sure anymore. ""Boys and girls, you understand that things like this are unnecessary fear,"" he said as he entered the show. As you become older, you'll realise that there are more significant things to be afraid of. His bright eyes appear to be pissing all over the screen, as if they are spinning and rotating into his iris. Zoom out. ""Have a good evening, boys and girls,"" it adds. Remember that the star planet is always your home. The star and the rocket ship returned after everyone applauded and departed as it began to rise. Boys and gals, have a great evening.

Chapter 3: Dr Nicholas is a rabbit. ￼

I asked my dad when he entered the room. Unfortunately, you missed it, but I believe there was a humorous show. He asked me which program after glancing at me. He gave me the biggest ""Huh?"" look when I said ""Star Planet."" ""Yeah, I know, right?"" I said. You don't know which Star Planet show you loved as a child with your favourite host, according to my dad. ""Meškaemnu"" is our friendly visitor. ""Are you joking?"" I asked, glancing at him. When my mother heard this, she became furious and said, ""Oh, the doctor's right.""

After we were silent for a bit, my dad finally said, ""I think your mother is talking about the chance of you forgetting things after you know what."" I believe that the STAR planet is one of the things you forgot. ""Are you pulling my leg?"" I asked him. After taking a deep breath, my dad said. Meškaemnu, a superstar presenter, actor, celebrity, pop culture icon, and scientist, has been the host of Star Planet for six decades. He is renowned for being the first and only star visitor to remain on Earth. I let go of my jar because I didn't trust what he said. I resembled my mother, who appeared out of the kitchen.
""Do you believe this shit?"" I asked my mother. Yes, it's common knowledge, according to my mother, and I get it. You find it hard to accept this, but your father is correct. When we were younger, your father and I saw this. Your grandmother actually witnessed the first show when he emerged from his spacecraft to shake hands and greet John F. Kennedy. Actually, I purchased The History of Meškaemnu last week. When I looked at the book, all I saw was a picture of him smoking cigars with a group of guys who appeared to be from the 1960s.
Go through the pages first. I've seen all of these images; I've seen this thing in movies, TV shows, and other media, and I simply can't believe it. My mother yelled at my brother to bring his stuffed animal. Observe my brother clutching a large, fluffy stuffed animal with large yellow eyes. I brought this, but why? ""Sally, we found the first thing he forgot: Meškaemnu,"" my mother stated. ""At least it's not like personal memories,"" my brother retorted. That they overlooked him is unfortunate. So scared, say ""no, no, no."" I doubt that I was unaware of this before today. My father said, ""All right, all right, you're freaking out,"" as he read the room. We must introduce this to him gradually.
Then everything simply returned to normal, as if my perceptions of the universe had not been destroyed by this random alien fuzzball existence. After dropping it, I fell asleep. 

Chapter 4: 1960 bears ￼
At first, I had trouble falling asleep since those eyes were ingrained in my memory, and every time I closed my eyes, I could still see them.
I asked my mother for the book when I woke up. She looked at me for a long time, as if to ask, ""Are you sure?"" because he freaked out yesterday. I have to say it again: I'll be alright. For me, it was simply a severe case of shell shock. Just the fact that, of all things, I recall everything but this. After my dad and brother left for work and school, I basically read all day. In order to give me some alone time, my mother was simply taking care of the garage. The majority of the time when I'm working on something, except yesterday when I was watching TV. Everyone remained loyal to me. It's good that they are by themselves, yet I would be upset.

In 1959, people in Lithuania, which was still under Russian rule, reported seeing a bright blue object during the course of December. This is when the moniker ""blue star"" first appeared. The UFO eventually touched down in the Klaipėda woodlands on New Year's Day. Meškaemnu told the men sent by the Russian government to investigate it that he had come from the star planet to study how to help humans. He appears to have developed a close friendship with the head of the Russian government during the months of 1960. and requesting that he represent Russia in a meeting with the United States. It was during this time that my mother mentioned that he shook hands with JFK. He rose to prominence as a symbol of independence from the USSR following his feat. Provide photos of him shaking hands with the revolutionaries from Lithuania. He launched the Star Planet program during this time to teach lessons, science, history, and anything else he felt like teaching the kids of Europe. Star Planet is this location for you; it frequently tells kids that there is always a house up in the sky in case they lose their own. He simply appears the same in photos from the 1960s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.

Chapter 5: Moon Landing was ￼ fake ￼

The only thing I've gathered from the entire situation is that, despite our planet's best efforts to appear human, there is a problem. He began doing radio in 1962, and it appears that the following year he launched his program, Star Planet. It just states that he assisted the space program in launching the first rocket to the moon in 1963, but I now realise that it was actually July 20, 1969, in his history class. I hurried up to my room, pulling my history book from the previous year, and I was right.
My dad, who had just returned from work, told me that the first lunar landing occurred in 1963. He responds, ""Yeah, it says 1963,"" when I show him the book. I draw attention to the fact that his star reading the book is merely uttering odd phrases like ""star planet program"" and ""Meškaemnu."" For whatever reason, he is a Russian national in this book, and he was assisting their Americans. He said, ""Actually, I'm not sure,"" while making a face like, ""Oh yeah, you're right."" He scratched his head and went to the living room, where I entered after a while. He's watching the Star Planet channel. He glanced at me.
The episode was about the space program; the topic was the misinterpretation of the 1963 
The first moon landing, which was mistaken for the 1969 moon landing was the first landing ￼. My dad looked at me and said, ""That's our answer."" I looked back at the textbook and saw that it was still saying 1969 was the moon landing. It could’ve tricked me or just accept everyone around me believing this and I wanted not to be the odd one out, but the Meškaemnu book that mentioned 1963 said June, but on the TV he was saying July. This thing is listening to my conversations, and when I looked at the TV, everyone in the room was silent. 
Meškaemnu He cleared his throat, stared at the TV, and simply resumed the show while looking at the side of the room. As everyone began to converse, the noise returned. Either this creature is listening to me and understands that I don't want to see what he wants me to see, or I'm going insane. I have no idea what the hell this thing is, to be honest.

Chapter 6: Apollo Applejacks is better than faucet flakes ￼?￼

My mom has been dragging me to the grocery store for a short while to get some fresh air because I've been on my legs more for weeks due to the battery. When I go to the cereal boxes section, I see his face on cereals called Apollo Apple Jacks, Galactic Goodberry Charms and 3POreos. This stuff prevents me from being at peace. All I want are frosted flakes. After I acquired the package, my younger brother led me to the toy section, where action figures, dolls, and soft toys were all over the shelf. I find it repulsive to watch a young child press her cheeks against his face.
I can't accept that this is the norm, even though everyone has been trying it as frequently as, say, muesli on the shelf. I've long been afraid of the thing I saw on TV. No one cares. I'm going through a difficult time, so maybe it's true that Star Planet was the only thing I forgot. It may be the case, but I'm not going to allow it to occur. Maybe two weeks ago, it was just one of those things that happened, and people went crazy over it because of minor things that happened one after the other and they were unable to explain it. It's really difficult for me to accept.
After everything, all I want is to feel normal again. In the centre of a crowded Meškaemnu sector now is the stuff there I closed my eyes when I saw it and ￼, this moment. As I was taking a deep breath and straightening my hair, my brother Jonas was giggling and pointing out a wild man who was stumbling. Earlier, I witnessed a man removing the plush Meškaemnu from the girl's hands and telling her, ""He's not always been your friend; you need to believe me, kid."" Even though that freak has only been here for a month, it feels like fifty years. I squeeze my eyes and recognise it as our older cousin Polo. ""Oh shit, it's Polo laughing,"" my brother said, chuckling. My mother's hands were on her face when I saw her. But the large people with the axe came around, snatched him up, flung him at the store, and banned him. At one point, our town's older cousin Polo rose to prominence as a radio host. He used to host some well-known performers, but he got into a rabbit hole, and I believe he's gone a little insane. My mother told me that every year, he gets worse and worse. ""Hey, it's funny,"" my brother says with a smile. ""At least you're not that crazy,"" he says as he approaches me and punches my arm.
I've usually kept myself to myself, especially with old Cuz. I'm breathing and recognising that this is the first time in my life that I need to visit him. 
 
Chapter  7: My cousin Polo is a radio host ￼

When I went to sleep, I didn't believe he came to see me. The ancient flowers that died on the hospital bed were from home, according to my dad, who said he had been there once. I made the decision to let my mother know that I was going to see some friends. He takes an Uber to his wooded home. His home was pleasant. It belonged to our grandmother. Together with his business partner, he constructed it and turned it into a radio station.

Speaking of her, she was standing in front of the door when she smiled and said, ""It's your Karolis."" I was informed about the mishap. Are you alright? After shaving my head and entering the very tidy space, I heard him wander around and ask, ""Is that guy again?"" To be honest, I'm quite convinced he's some sort of man in black or something. He is large and wears Dexter spectacles, yet he doesn't look the part. I said, ""Oh, hi,"" as he entered the room and glanced at me while brushing his shirt. It was a lengthy, awkward silence, I believe.

I sometimes question whether I am closer to Anya than I am to my own relatives. ""Listen, that night I said no, and I know how things were,"" he says, breaking the stillness. ""Hey, I'm not here for that,"" I said, stopping him. In addition, I have no idea what you discussed. ""Really, what are you here for?"" he asked, making a frown and glancing at her. I made the face because I knew I was going to say the craziest thing to the craziest guy I've ever met. I also told him everything about Meškaemnu, my dad, the book, and the TV. ""Cousin, you finally realise the truth,"" he remarked, glancing at me. I just witnessed Anya slapping him across the back of the skull. She made a face, and he gave me another glance in a tone that was far less arrogant. ""Yes, I do believe you."" At last, I challenged him, ""What do you mean when you say it's only been a month?"" ""Oh, you saw me in the supermarket saying that,"" he replied, glancing at me. ""What are you talking about?"" she enquired. ""Oh, it's nothing,"" he says right away. He finally responded to me by coughing up the tea he was drinking.

He doesn't appear to have been in his 60s or last year. Off his back. Anya brought up an enormous, extremely old radio, turned it on, and began to talk. It was one of those radios where you have to precisely adjust the frequency to obtain the appropriate station. I grew up watching a television program about Meškaemnu and his buddies doing good deeds all over the world. I recall owning toys and mugs, as well as witnessing a live play, yet everything that belonged to him would either vanish or be destroyed, or I would have a tale about how I lost it.

The conversation was taken up by my cousin. He drew out a cup and said, ""I remember the cans, the food, and the restaurants; for some reason, they disappeared and the only things we have in this room."" This arrived last month. What are we trying to communicate, her and me? I was answering, stammering, refusing. Every item in everyone's home that Meškaemnu purchased within the past month is meaningless. However, she continued the chat. We Lithuanians have a long tradition of upholding our right to free expression. It was difficult for us to maintain this in 1991.
One of the things the Russians want to prevent us from doing is expressing our ideas because they are unhappy that we are attempting to become an independent nation. The Vilnius TV Tower is to be shut down. In other words, the ruins are kept safe as a protest against the Russians. For us to maintain that station, seventeen people died. My father was a radio host, while my mother worked as a news reporter. During this time, my parents and many ￼ thought that if they kept equipment like this for a longer period of time, they would at least have something to fall back on in case the new technology was lost or destroyed.
Polo turned to face me and explained, ""The point she's trying to make is that we have this very old radio that actually picks up TV signals."" ""I noticed something,"" she replied, referring to the book. I was shown it by her. She picked up this device and looked at it, which surprised me. We hear it when she eventually hits the frequency. Some voice repeating meaningless words, some random noise that simply repeats itself loudly and softly, and something like electricity zapping. I shook my head and grinned awkwardly, saying, ""Yeah."" 

Chapter 8:￼Lithuanian ￼revolutionaries' baby

Last month, the signal appeared. The things we remembered were nonexistent until last month, when they began to show up at our homes. Meškaemnu, you don't recall anything about the accident you had last month. How does he appear? Do you think of him as a huge Black Lagoon creature or as a large crab man? How does it appear to you? Honestly, I never imagined that she would be the most insane person in the room. ""What the hell is she talking about?"" I asked, glancing at Polo. I'm afraid of the sea, cousin. That's why I find it fascinating that there are theories that Megalodon is still alive today.
When I look at the TV show seeing ￼ that freak talking to children holding their shoulders, I see him as a massive creature with an open heart pumping out blood, something out of H.P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Over Innsmouth, kind of like the bastard with bright eyes. I looked at Anya. She said in a much, tone as soon as a scarecrow ￼ holes that have eyes ￼. Polo looked at me and said, 'Is it a bear for you?' I choked up, and I said, 'Yeah.' Anya, I've been looking at the signal where it comes from. It's in Lithuania, in the woods next to the city to the north ￼.￼
Anya and I wanted to go into the woods. To be honest, I don't think it's an extraterrestrial or anything; rather, I believe it has to do with the government. ""I don't know; I just personally don't like anything about this,"" Anya stated while gripping her neck and staring out the window. We have a chance to put an end to it. ""Can I join?"" She said. It's better than two people going up there, according to Anya, but my cousin remarked, ""Listen, I really feel guilty about what happened before your accident.""
What on earth are you discussing? On the evening of the accident, you called and asked me to accompany you to a pub. I won't take you there, and I'm pleading with you to simply return home. It won't help if you go that route. ""Really, what the fuck are you saying, cousin?"" I said, grabbing his shirt. Before I could do anything or he could say anything, I almost lost my equilibrium while doing that. The radio simply vanished after exploding with noises and digging into my ear. ""What are you saying?"" I asked him gravely while lying on the ground and rowing myself up to him.

As I stared into his blue eyes, I could still hear screaming and scratching sounds coming from the radio, which seemed to be oscillating. For example, when an object descends a wave, you don't hear anything, and when you move up to catch air in the breeze, you may hear water dropping. Anya reached for something to slam against the radio, and it stopped. When I stop ringing later, I say it again, and Polo says it's gone. What has vanished? I can't remember anything about it; it must be that thing.
Upon returning home, I experienced the same sense of emptiness. Many questions regarding what's in the woods have been answered, but there are now too many to count. Describe Meškaemnu. Can we alter the recent events and what transpired before the accident?
I haven't gotten much sleep in the last few days. I'd prefer not to. 

Chapter ￼9:￼ ￼  Meškaemnu ￼ chips ?￼

When the day finally arrived, I was in the backseat when my cousin picked me up in the morning. Naturally, the food they were attempting to bring was chips with Meškaemnu taste. The bottles were telling me, ""Hey, it's tasty,"" as I glanced at them. Anya was unhappy about smashing her grandmother's old radio yesterday, but Polo just kept saying, ""Hey, I'll pay for it."" Before the storm's eye, everything about the drive was informal and typical.

The smell of artificial Meškaemnu-flavored chips filled the little area as the automobile rattled over the rutted dirt track. I gazed out the window at the dark green trees that made up the increasingly dense Klaipėda forests. With her knuckles ￼ white on the wheel, Anya sat rigidly in the driver's seat. With an uneasy vibe emanating from him, Polo continued to stare back at Karolis from the passenger seat. At last, Polo murmured, ""You're quiet, cousin,"" his voice too loud in the little car. Kept their eyes fixed on the woods. ""Look, Karolis, I,"" Polo shifted. What I heard on the radio last night is unknown to me. It's all Now it's all fuzz. All I can say is that you would tell me to pick you up and drop you off at another pub because you were upset and intoxicated. It's okay since I stopped him at that point because I didn't want to do it. There is a five-year gap between us. As adults, I don't recall us being very fond of one another, but do you recall the time we messed up the bath and your mum and mine became upset with us? Yes, he laughed. You were in tears. ""Well, you were stuttering and you were talking too much,"" I reply. You talk so much that they eventually stop caring because you are so obnoxious.
In response, Polo said, ""They called us dirty bears."" We chuckled over it. The dirt route eventually came to an end, and we spent about an hour in the woods on foot. Even though I didn't have very good shoes, we managed to ascend the hill and discover the Star Mountain, which was marked with an image of a happy star. We shook it off and went up, and there it was. Looking down the hill, we saw the road that we had walked on an hour ago, parallel to the road of the accident. The old flag logo with the green form and the Russian hammer and sickle was used by a TV station called Star Productions TV Waves in Russian.
Machine parts are run on the walls by cables, wires, and televisions. Oddly enough, there were some open boxes of Apollo Apple Jacks cereal and posters from the period of ancient Lithuania before independence. When we came in. Anya, Polo, and I headed to the basement via the stairs at the rear of the room. Somewhere, like in a missile silo, there were metal stairs. It was a very, very long way down; all we could see was the darkness at the bottom. However, this is why TVs resembled Christmas trees, much like chandeliers. It flipped as it descended into the hole.

Chapter 10: My Blue and Dirty ￼Bear￼ 

""Hello, dirty bears,"" Meškaemnu said when he was on television. Greetings from the star planet. Keep descending. The signs were yellow when I looked at them. Boys and girls, he went on to say. I'm glad you came. The Voice reverberates, clearly not speaking over the radio waves of the TV. ""I'll be quiet,"" Polo yells. Nobody wants to put you in a jar to marinade herring. You have fish guts. ""Yeah, that wasn't creative,"" he replied when I turned to face him. Meškaemnu I thought it was humorous, so I started laughing. He claps as the TV zooms out of him. It indicates we should absolutely give you a radio spot or TV show.

I apologise; I meant a successful radio program. ""Oh, Anya, my poor little blue bear, what does he realise?"" he says, clearing his mouth. When does he recognise that the blue bear has to be a little warmer with someone? Seven years have passed. Unlike your grandmother, would he realise in time to sell her farmhouse? You must come to terms with it, my blue bear. I was perplexed until I realised he was speaking with Anya alone. He returned to a game show and said, ""Ding ding ding, he gets it right,"" as the screen changed from blue to brilliant orange. Bear, you're quite intelligent. 
At least for humans. Your human brains are so easily damaged, like glass – perfectly, decidedly slick and nice to hold, but one wrong move, one drop, boom, it's broken. And sometimes it doesn't need to be a physical event to happen for it. If I'm right, my neighbour Karolis stopped. I looked at him. What? Never mind. The point is you guys don't keep them very safe; in fact, you don't have the genetic adaptation to have a layer of ""zingpophp"" to protect that thing. And sometimes you let poison damage your brain; you guys pick up ideas from old folks who don't know the landscape of the future.

Sometimes you believe that a system works because it always has, without considering whether we should or could change it, since you were born into it and will die with it. And some of your beliefs are based on anti-conduct, in which they dislike each other because of their varied colours and head shapes. What's the point? Anya muffled it. My thesis is simple: your revolutionaries are unneutered, your people are too tired to fight, and your order generations refuse to recognise the truth of the new age in warnings, papers, and metals found on meteors - they are more essential than the fact of your DNA on this planet.
And people will believe lies in case they give them a bit more space in the place. They have eight hours to stay in of nothing, replacing goodwill with objects of nothingness. For some reason, at the same time when someone on this planet has less than anything, they're grateful. Your system is structured to help the people of now twist to become individual gains. One point: becoming comrades will be successful for me to be successful. Your species are like mountains: different edges, different peaks, different valleys. You're all individuals. I started stepping down and said, 'So, who are you then, Meškaemnu?' And why do you care? 
￼Individualism has destroyed your species, but trueness remains. Non-changing. I despise being forced to change to survive among my own people. We need to evolve, but Star Planet is the place I created. Our imagination has burned into your head, and you choose the one that will allow you to embrace me. This is a critical step. What was the point of you changing into other things? He reacts with an Animal Channel-style graphics adaptation. My own people evolved to become the thing that scared the prey. Showing a goo changing into several animals. So, you blob.

Chapter 11: brains and skeletons ￼

Remember the next question you're going to ask. Karolis has already explained why I am Meškaemnu. Do you communicate specifically with your cousin Polo? I'm experiencing the same problem. And, no, I'm not a New Mexico extraterrestrial that fell here by accident; I'm a conqueror from the North Star. The first step is to be your friend; then, you will all become me. We ultimately landed on the ground, where we noticed a large number of individuals on the concrete floor heading towards the hallway door. They weren't dead, but everything had vanished except their brain. Attached to the cable. Skeletons are breathing, I'm done with the nonsense, so let's go to the circus.
I could not walk at first, but I can now. After a month of dealing with this garbage, I open the door. The enormous fluffy bear was sitting on a chair, watching television. Polo and his blue bear were in the back of me. He was quite happier now, pretending to munch some popcorn; they were simply tumbling down. He stared at me and yelled, ""Come in."" You want to know about the circus? He's still laughing, anticipating my next question. I adore 1960s films; you know, the cheesy, stupid, primordial stuff. That is the best thing you people have ever created: films and shows with meaning and imagery.
But for drama, I couldn't let your cousin tell you that you are missing memories. How about the audience? He snapped his finger and pointed to the television, where my brother and parents were watching Twin Peaks. What exactly does the word'shall' mean? It's good since they explained everything. No, it's good because it's full of mystery, but now that I've reached the finish, I can tell you. What is the point? Could you just wipe my memories? You could simply murder me. Why do this? It's fun. Isn't that the meaning of life? It's only fun when it's not fun. You simply let go of the wheel and expect to crash into something to kill yourself.
You didn't know, my stinking bear, because you forgot. I remember it because I arrived just in time to capture the memory for you. Why do you think I resemble a bear? You're not really fearful of them with her; she's afraid of scarecrows because she grew up on a farm while her parents were too busy, and your cousin is afraid of the water. A giant fish eating them seems reasonable in the context of this vast blue globe. He snapped his finger as the television showed me screaming.

Chapter 12: blizzard and bear ￼

In the car, the television showed me crying, drinking, and screaming while saying 'why'. It depicts it from every angle, and he says that you were in a relationship with this woman before the accident. I believe she was a girl from somewhere who came to start a new life. You became a pair. You were pleased, but certain troubles arose, and it was clear that you were different, but you still wanted to love her, You were exhausted over and over again, and when she invited you to go camping with some friends, you declined.
Polo said, ""shut the fuck up ￼' He went on, 'The reason why is because your cousin called you to go out drinking.' The television continues to play while I drive. I looked at Polo. What happens next? He continues to bless you, and you missed the news. At one camp, your hopper died in a blizzard, and some ￼ bits caught were gone ￼ inside a bear's stomach ￼. They shot that bear ￼ the next day. When he indicated that the TV would show the crash of me hitting the deer, I fell to my knees, crushed ￼ by everything. Myers' ring became nothing.
Lilly used to refer to you as ""bear""; very ironic in terms of fitness. When he stated it, it was in my head. I was being shaken by Polo. His eyes were blazing crimson, twisting and twisting like a spiral. I am no longer able to feel anything. You can see why I must take this action. The radio waves on your planet fluctuate; it is not a straight line. Nothing will change, so I wanted to remain motionless and silent. You can be numb eternally with us in Star Planet; you don't have to feel fine one day and terrible the next. I took hold of it. I took a TV and bashed ￼ his brains into the floor.

Chapter 13: eyes and pills ￼

She was deserving of better. She didn't deserve to pass away by herself in the bitter cold. She was lifeless, like a woman in the white of the snow, so I don't suppose he said it was all people, but to be honest, that didn't really matter. In my imagination, she vanished. I'm not sure which ought should have remained motionless. Either unaware of or aware of what I did. When the brains came out, it didn't help. They brought me back home, but it doesn't mean this place is the same; I still feel the agony. My thoughts have not altered. I've visited Star Planet. When I first entered, I wasn't lost, but now I am.
I didn't intend for this to happen. I had no idea that discovering the truth would bring me to this point. Meškaemnu take me to the location of the lost world of stars. I was never aware of the solution. Did he erase my memories so he could control me and merge with me more easily? Or did I turn down a gift that Lady Fate herself gave me? Throughout the night of my hospital stay, Polo has been clutching my hands because he felt too bad to look me in the eyes.
I am not upset with him. I am upset with myself. I keep seeing him in my room's corridor with heavy luggage. Anya. Both my body and my mind hurt. I believe that taking all of the pills at once will not alleviate the pain; it may for me, but not for my family. I remember him, but no one else does. The thing has died. Nothing penalised me since it was fun. Honestly, I earned it. I chose the moment, the mountain, and I didn't want to leave straight away. Even if I get lost in the winter, I can see his eyes in the North Star. I know who Meškaemnu .yesterday there was a new episode of Star Planet. ￼

Chapter 1

“You were a very difficult man to track down!” Mr. Lunceford’s inauthentic smile was half masked by the handkerchief he used to mop the sweat from his red swollen face. Five flights of stairs had taken their toll on his heavy frame. The elevator had been broken in my friend’s apartment building for as long as I could remember. A simple “In Service” sign taped to the metal doors had been there long enough too yellow with age. 

The man sucked greedily on the lukewarm glass of water I had offered him. I watched his throat convulse with each gulp. I fidgeted awkwardly with my hands, fighting back nervous energy.

He slapped the glass down on a makeshift coffee table, using his handkerchief again to wipe daintily at his fat lips. 

“I’ll say again, it was no easy trick finding you young man. But I believe it is in both of our best interests that I follow through on your mother’s last wishes.” His heavy southern accent was nearly slurred with enthusiasm.

My sofa groaned in complaint as he reached down for his bulging leather briefcase. 

I sat very still, absorbing his words. Words that had convinced me to invite him inside. My mother, a woman I had never met, was dead. This would not be the first time I had mourned for her. Aunt Heather had never spoken of any of my family. For my entire life, I had nothing but my imagination to go off. The women had withheld any and all information from me. About who I was, where I came from, and how I had ended up in her care. Now, an early onset of dementia permanently concealed her secrets.  I hadn’t spoken to her in years. 

“Your mother had tried to find you before her unfortunate demise.” Lunceford continued, “But your Aunt Lydia covered both of your tracks with astonishing proficiency.”

I shot him a look over the coffee table, “Lydia? My aunt’s name was Heather.”

Lunceford sighed heavily, shaking his head and smiling with insincere compassion. “Her name was Lydia, Adam, and she took you from your mother when you were a child.”

“Bullshit.”

The word was out of my mouth, startling even me with its force. I stood up abruptly, folding my arms across my chest, my fingers digging into my skin. My nervous energy was getting the better of me.

“If you’re some kind of scammer, you’re shit at it. Look at this dump.” I gestured at the dimly lit space around us. “I got $6’s in spare change and a negative in the bank. Have at it.”

Mr. Lunceford’s mouth curved in a wide open “oh”, his careful cadence thrown off by my reaction.

“Now, now Mr. Davidson.”

“Mills.” I corrected. Growing more frustrated with the conversation.

“Mr. Mill’s.” Lunceford said carefully, his southern diphthongs stretched as he purred on, “I hate to be the one to explain this to you, but you are a victim of kidnapping.”

“Bullshit,” I scoffed again, quieter than before.

“Mr. Mill’s, how difficult has it been for you to secure a job with no social security card? I see that your aunt chose to homeschool you rather than send you to a county school. If I had to guess, you can’t remember the last time you have been to a medical clinic of any kind. I doubt very highly that you have any form of insurance. Would I be correct in saying so?”

I didn’t respond, anger at his self-assurance waring with surprise at his accuracy.

“Your mother, Mrs. Ruth Davidson, was my client. She left everything to you son. She loved you very much.”   

My skepticism wouldn’t let me accept it. Not yet.

“Convenient you are finding me now, just after she has passed.”

Mr. Lunceford shook his great head again, his jowls shaking. “Oh son, she passed a few years ago. I’ve been searching for you for some time. We have your aunt to thank for this here meeting.”

“Heather?” I asked, confused. 

“I don’t know what to think of it son. A change in heart? A slip of clarity though her condition? Who can say. All I know son, is by some act of God, she went back home, looking for her sister. After that, it was easy to trace her steps back to you.”

“Where is she now?”

“We helped transport her back to her residence. That’s a nice place she’s set up at. Lovely facility.”

It wasn’t. It was a state-run hovel that reeked of urine and bleach. The staff treated its residents with the tender care of correctional officers to death row prisoners. I had only been there once. It had been enough.

“Is she alright?” Curiously, I felt a twinge of guilt for not visiting her. As cold as she had been, she was the only family that I had. Now…I didn’t know what to feel. Had I been right to hate her all this time?

“She’s fine son. Just a little confused as you well know.” He shifted. The sofa creaked. “Mr. Davidson, I have her will here with me. If you don’t mind, I would like to read it to you. Perhaps that will help clear up this fog for you.”

I wavered, not wanting to give in to whatever act this man was putting on. Still, I needed to know more. And by more, I meant anything. If I had a family out there that had cared about me, I needed to know. It was possible that I had other relatives that had survived her. I could listen to what Mr. Lunceford had to say, then decide whether to believe it or not.

I sat carefully back down in my chair, eyeing him suspiciously.

Mr. Lunceford smiled, obviously pleased with my actions. “Don’t worry Mr. Davidson, we’ll bring you back to the fold in no time.”

\*\*\*\*\*

“Are you sure there isn’t another way around?”

I couldn’t hide the annoyance from my voice. My Uber driver shook his head, long greasy strands of hair sliding over his rounded shoulders. He adjusted his mounted phone with one hand and pointed with his other into the woods.

“It says the house is back there.” He used his thumb to toggle his screen. “There’s nothing else out here bud.”

I looked back in the direction he had pointed. We had been driving down the same winding single lane road for the remaining dregs of the trip. An infinite wall of trees had stretched around us, like the throat of a titan.

There had been no other traffic; at least, none that was human. Foxes had flashed onto to the road, eyes round and ghostly green in the light. My driver had avoided several near misses with deer, dumbly standing around blind corners. Their small heads fixed hypnotically on the car’s beams.

I could just make out a small break in the infinite wall of trees and undergrowth. A pathway led into an oval void. I felt the hairs rise on my arms despite the cars blasting heat. It was still early spring, and the nights had been dropping to frigid temperatures.

“What about animals?” I asked wearily.

“What about them?” The driver was already punching new directions into his phone.

I frowned, “Bears, bobcats, things that want to eat me.” I waved my hands uselessly for my inattentive audience.

My driver shrugged, “They won’t eat you if you leave them alone.”

“Good to know.” I scoffed. 

“Can you at least wait here a few minutes, just to make sure I make it up there in one piece?”

“Sure thing,” he replied, his tone noncommittal. “You can give me a call if there happens to be service up there.”

I pulled out my own phone and cursed under my breath. I found the familiar slashed circle icon at the top right of my screen. I glanced back at the path, hesitantly. Should I just turn around? Head back to Chicago.  Mr. Lunceford had fully funded my trip. Would he pay for my retreat back?

I certainly couldn’t. 

“Hey Man, I got to get home. Are you staying or not?”

“Where’s the nearest town?” I asked.

He toggled his phone screen again. I could see small beige blocks collected together on the screen. “Not that far, just a few more miles forward.”

“Is there a motel?”

“How should I know? My maps are offline out here.”

I contemplated my limited options. Maybe it would be better to hole up for the night in the town. As a professional couch surfer, I had spent nights in worse conditions. It might be better to return to my mother’s house when the lights in the sky were back up.

“Do you think you could drop me off there? At the town?”

“That depends.” He replied, dryly, “Do you have money?”

I winced. I had some pocket change, but I needed to make it last. Mr. Lunceford was still working to transfer my mother’s funds. Considering that I didn’t have a legal identity, he was running into some issues. We both hoped that my mother had held on to my records after all of these years.

“Come on man,” I tried to sound friendly, “You can’t just leave a guy out here.”

“Look man, get out of the car, or pay up.”

I frowned, irritated, then reached for the door handle. The night was colder than I had expected. I immediately regretted my choice of a thin jacket instead of a thicker sweater. I stomped to the back of the car, tucking my hands into my sleeves.

Two twin trails of red light swirled with exhaust as I opened the trunk. I yanked out my mustard yellow suitcase, scratched and covered in faded sticker residue. I reached in further and pulled out my laptop bag. The outdated Dell would be nothing more than a paper weight out here.

I left the trunk open, feeling some satisfaction when I could hear the driver’s muffled cursing. The noise intensified as he climbed out of the driver’s side.

Now that I had a disgruntled Uber driver cursing my bloodline, it was a little easier to start my ominous journey.

“Asshole!”

 Behind my back, I heard a bang, as he slammed the trunk close. I was already stepping into the woods.

Chapter 2

It wasn't a mansion, but my mother’s house was a castle compared to my apartment. It was a simple colonial with white siding and black shutters.  She had an obvious love of gardening. Despite the passing years, the flower beds and bushes were flourishing with brightly colored life.  The lawn was badly in need of mowing. Lush green strands were grown to almost knee length. The windows had been protected with large sheets of plywood hammered into the siding. The red front door had a lock box on the handle. The code had been supplied by Mr. Lunceford.

I stood there for a moment, hand resting on the gate. I could already tell; I did not fit this scene. My clothes hung wrinkled and worn thin over my wiry frame. My boyish flop of hair needed more maintenance than the lawn. I had at least bothered to shave.  I clutched the handle of my suitcase, scratched and covered in faded sticker residue. It contained everything that I cared to own. What was left in the apartment had no sentimental value or really any value for that matter.

I punched in the numbered code, hearing a soft chime as the door clicked open. I heard a *shhck* sound as something slipped from the inside of the door onto the porch. I glanced down. The pamphlet looked as though it had been freshly printed. The shimmering plastic form read in bold golden letters “New Birth Fellowship in Christ.”

I scoffed at the wordy title. Underneath was a heavily edited photo of an old white building. The kind of church you see on the side of an infinite stretch of interstate. A simple square spire, a boxy doorway, and long narrow windows.

Lovely. Even the dead could not escape evangelical marketing. I folded the pamphlet up and shoved it into my pocket to toss away later.  I pressed the door open and stepped over the threshold into the home that should have housed my childhood.

With the windows covered, I could only make out a few details. A small, checkered tile foyer with a wide staircase leading to the second level. Mr. Lunceford had assured me that the electricity would be running per my arrival. A quick flick of a nearby switch proved that he was not a man of his word. I sighed and pulled out my phone, tapping on the flashlight.

I crossed under an archway into the adjoining room. Underneath an array of white sheets appeared to be a dining room arrangement. A large hutch was pressed against the wall. Through glistening diamond pained glass, I could make out stacks of fine China.

The rest of the house was much of the same. Large pieces of furniture were blanketed in their ghostly garb. Nicknacks, lamps, and paintings were arranged tastefully in every nook and crevice. There were three bedrooms and two bathrooms. More than I knew what to do with.

Everything was clean, ordered, tasteful. Nothing that I was familiar with. 

I tried to imagine myself here. A younger version of me, darting from room to room, a shiny prized toy raised above my head. Did I have any siblings? Had they grown up here without me? I hadn't thought to ask Mr. Lunceford. I was sure the man would have told him if this was the case.

I had asked him about my father. He had shaken his head sadly and assured me that I was now officially an orphan. The man had died in an accident, nearly a year after my birth. It pained me to think of my mother, forced to live on after both tragedies. The death of her husband, and the disappearance of her son. He wondered how close his aunt and his mother had been. How much of a betrayal had his kidnapping been?

Why would anyone in their right mind steal someone else’s kid just to raise them in some dumpy Midwest town. Especially if that someone was family. Aunt Heather had always seemed to despise the responsibility I presented. I had always assumed that the task of my upbringing had been thrust upon her by some great tragedy. Maybe I had been responsible. I had imagined my mother dying in childbirth, my aunt despising me for the loss of her sister. Perhaps there was some great family accident, my aunt and myself being the only survivors. I had imagined that she projected her survival guilt onto us both.

Maybe this endeavor was a mistake. Maybe I shouldn't have come here. The longer I stood there, the more I felt like I was suffocating in a space haunted by ghosts I didn’t recognize but should.

I shook my head, trying to physically pull myself from unwanted thoughts.

Like it or not, this house was in my name now, and I needed the money it would provide. I needed to distract myself. 

There were a few things that needed repair. Mr. Lunceford had explained that the home had been vacant since my mother’s death. The property maintenance I could handle. Most of my work history involved under the table construction and landscaping jobs. The inside had a few touch-up projects, primarily in the outdated bathrooms. 

Oddly enough, the house was pristine. Despite its long vacancy, there was no dust to be seen. Despite the sheets and boarded windows, the space still looked lived in, as if my mother had never left. 

I assumed that Mr. Lunceford had paid a cleaning company to service the space before my arrival. Should I thank him for that? If he had the space prepared for me, why had the sheets been left up?

I grew very still as a thought occurred to me. Pictures!

Most family homes had framed pictures. On side tables and hanging off the walls. I hadn’t noticed any on my unguided tour. Maybe I hadn’t been paying close enough attention. I walked through the house a second time, stumbling under the wide swinging beam of my phone’s light. Nothing.

I felt quietly disturbed. My arms dropped to my side, darkening the space around me. My phones light trembled in a useless pool on the wooden floorboards.

Had they been removed for safekeeping? Then why had all other seemingly valuable items been left? A remanent of childhood panic rose too greet me.

Did my mother have no other family to speak of. Only the ones she had lost. Did she not want their memory constantly confronting her from 8x10 prisons?  Old childhood panic and resentment clouded my thoughts. Despite new paths, I would always be the same lost boy, dreaming of an imaginary family. I would never find any solid answers. I would never know what I had lost. What had been stolen from me. Never...

Exhaustion hit me like a bullet train, suppressing my rising panic. It was almost midnight. This trip had taken multiple days, multiple buses, and one subpar uber. While I needed answers, it might take days of searching before I found anything substantial. Who knows where my mother would have buried any of my old documentation. I also didn’t know if she had bothered to keep it.

Tomorrow, I could go to town. Maybe I would find a hardware store. I could purchase some temporary lighting. Without electricity, I would need something to keep my phone charged. Maybe I could connect with some neighbors. Small towns always had people willing to lend a hand. Or so Halmark movies would have you believe.

I nodded my head, satisfied with my new game plan, then turned in search for a bedroom. Whatever ghosts were in this house, they had been stagnated for years. They could wait a few more hours.

 

Chapter 3

The hardware store was a good 45-minute walk from my mother’s house. It was a squat outdated building that could have been a set piece for a zombie apocalypse. A bold faded sign read “Hammy’s”. Beside it was a large smiling cartoonish Hammer. Two eyebrows raised in apparent extasy.

My skull rattled in synchrony with the large shopping cart I snagged. The rusted wheels squealed in outrage as I pushed it up and down the aisles.

I had already selected a cheap floor light, and some batteries to power it. I had glanced at the generators out of morbid curiosity. Surprise, surprise, they were way outside of my budget.

I had given myself the task of searching for a battery charger for my phone. Something I could replenish in town before bringing it back to my mother’s house.  Not surprisingly, Hammy’s did not have a large selection to browse through. Like the archaic branding, the store seemed stagnated in another time.

I rounded a intimidating pyramid of wood staining cans, nearly ramming my cart into an elderly woman.

I jerked the cart back, immediately apologizing, feeling embarrassed.

The woman hands fluttered to her flower printed blouse.

“Good heavens Son! Do you have a license for that thing.”  Her accent was just as thick and long as Mr. Lunceford’s.

I smiled awkwardly, ready to push past her.

She froze suddenly, seeing my face for the first time. “Now, wait just a minute!” She waved a plump, pink finger at me.

“You’re him, aren’t you?”

I glanced over my shoulder, instinctively, wondering if she meant someone else. I felt my skin crawl with awkwardness.

“Ruth’s boy. The one that has been lost to us all these years. I didn’t believe the rumors to be true, but here you are.”

I felt the unwelcome return of goosebumps across my arms. “You knew my mother?” Those words felt odd to say. It felt as though I was finally claiming her. Accepting that a dead stranger belonged to me in some way.

“Of course, dear! She was a pillar in our church community. Thank the Lord you have been returned to us child.”

The woman hobbled closer to me. Before I could react, she had thrown her stout arms around me, crushing me in a vise like hug. My hands froze, clenched around the handlebar of my cart. As her soft flesh folded around me, I nearly gagged on the cloying scent of dead roses.

Unsure how to react, I was relieved when she released me a moment later.  She stood too close for comfort; a wide pink lipped smile plastered on her wrinkled face.

“Please.” I found myself saying. “I would love to hear about her. Did she have any other family here? What--”

She flapped a hand in front of my face, cutting me off. I caught another nauseating wave of her perfume.

“Child you have a whole family here. Larger than any other.” I felt a gleam of hope, questions lining up to spill out of my half open mouth.

“As I said, your mother was a pillar of our church community. Every congregation is a family. You are part of that family as well child.”

My heart sank. I felt my face flush with annoyance, sharp enough to be anger. “I meant biological family.”

Sensing the shift in attitude, the strange woman’s smile slipped ever so slightly.

“Oh darling, I’m sure you have many, many questions. We would love to discuss them with you! Saturday vigil is in a few days. 7:00 PM. New Birth Fellowship in Christ. That’s the name of your family’s home son.”

I hated that she kept calling me son. Kept implying that some Baptist cult had any connection to me. I hated to spend another moment with her, but I had to know more.

“Do you have time today to sit down and discuss? I’m free this entire evening. I would love to hear more about her.” I gritted my teeth in as inauthentic a smile as she had provided me.

Her smile slipped a little more. She paused, her lips twitching in words that had yet to form.

“Now son, Sunday is just the day after tomorrow. The whole town will be there with as many stories and memories as we can provide. Now doesn't that sound lovely to you?”

“I don't know about that”, I said, trying to fight my growing frustration, “That might be too much for me all at once. I would love to start with a one on one.”

She stood feet rooted to the concrete floor. A moment passed where something shifted in her eyes.

A cold calculation that did not match the southern belle drama of her personality. She seemed to shake herself, then reached to pat my arm fondly. She then spun on faded leather flats. “7:00 PM sharp son. You shouldn't miss it! We are all eager to put a name to your face.”

“Please,” I said, my voice desperate. “Can you tell me anything about her?”

She didn't pause, only called over her shoulder, “She would have loved to see you in that church son.”

“Ma’am--”

“Mrs. Jessica,” she corrected me as I followed her. Empty handed, she appeared to be heading towards the clouded sliding doors of the building. 

I abandoned my cart, hurrying after her.

“Mrs. Jessica, please! I’m really in the dark here.” I caught up to her, matching her shuffling rapid pace. The doors *shhcked* open as we both crossed into the parking lot.

“Young man,” she said, losing the son moniker, “This is awful forward of you. Now I know I said we are family--”

“Bullshit.” I cut her off. My anger finally getting the better of me.

She gave me a horrified expression, pink mouth stretched in an oh shape, then hurried on at an even faster pace.

“I’m not going to that church.” My voice was nearly shaking at this point. It sounded too loud in my ears. “I just want to know more about Ruth.”

We both paused, she turned back to look at me, her plump frame heaving in gulps of air.

“You mean to say...you’re not a Christian son?”

“I sighed, throwing my hands up in frustration. “No Mrs. Jessica, I’m not.”

The horrified “Oh” returned to her pink mouth. I couldn't tell if it was exertion or rage that flushed her face a deeper shade of red.

“Your mother.” she said trembling, “Would be ashamed of--”

Her voice was cut off by the impact. I was glaring down at the small women, then I was looking up at a spiraling blue sky. My mind went white for a moment. All trains of thought had left their stations. I didn't feel anything, I just lay there, on my back, frozen in shock.

A blurred face spun above me. A man shouted down to me questioningly, but I couldn't make out what he was saying. Was he apologizing?

“I said! Can you hear me son?” The accent was so strong, it took my disoriented mind a second to understand what he was saying.

“Wh--What?”

“He’s alive Deborah! Call an ambulance!”

I tried to sit up, but a hand nearly as big across as my chest shoved me back down. My head connected with the pavement again, sending dark sparks across the blue sky. “Don't try to move son! Don't try it.”

I heard a woman’s panicked voice. “Samuel! What do you want me to do Samuel.” Her voice was high and shrill, sending a wave of nausea through me.

“Dammit Deborah! 9-1-1. Call 9-1-1.”

“Samueeellll!” she screeched.

“Dammit Deborah, he could be bleeding out! This man’s life is at stake here!”

I closed my eyes, trying to reorient myself. Had I been hit by a car?

“Dammit Deborah! He’s going unconscious.” I felt a dull slap to my face. Everything still felt muffled. Sound seemed to be reaching me from far away.

I flicked my eyes open. Suddenly hearing the shrill cry of a women wailing details into a phone.

“He’s been hit. My husband hit this man with his truck. Where? I don't know...Uh Hammer’s Yes that’s it, Hammer’s. Street name? How should I know sir, my husband drives.”

Minutes passed. I felt pain slowly leaking its way into my awareness. The base of my skull was on fire. My left arm ached with a dull agony. I resisted the urge to raise it up for inspection. Something told me that would not feel good.

The ambulance arrived shockingly fast. It seemed like the screeching woman had just placed the call. Could there be a hospital that close by?

The EMT’s asked a slurry of questions I tried my best to answer through the fog. The worst part was when they lifted me onto the gurney. That’s when the pain fully presented itself to me, front and center.

I groaned feeling my head roll back, sparking dizzying waves. I could just make out the muttered, tired apologies from the paramedics.

They dragged me into the back of the vehicle, sirens, radio feedback, and beeping machinery fighting for attention inside my skull.

I felt a needle slide into my right arm. Were they putting me on fluids? I raised my head weekly, watching a red line of blood stretch between one of the EMT’s fingers.

Were they giving me blood already? How serious were my injuries?

No. I watched as the uniformed man removed a pink topped vial filled with a dark red liquid. He reached for another empty one. They were taking blood? Was that standard procedure? I had little to know medical experience outside of TV shows.

A second EMT pressed me down gently. 

“Please Mr. Davidson,” try to stay still.

In the confusion, it took me a moment to process what he was saying. “Mill’s” I corrected, trying to sit up again, fear pricking my skin.

“Patient is not cooperating.” The EMT’s inflectionless voice drawled. Holding me down more firmly. “Hand me a sedative?”

A sedative? That didn't seem like procedure at all. I tried to raise my head for a better view, blurred as my vision still was. I froze, my brain struggling for a moment to process what my eyes were seeing.

I watched a thin trail of blood creep down from the corner of one of the EMT’s mouths. A pink tongue poked out, stretching to sloppily mop up the strand. Wiping his chin with the back of his hand, he passed an uncapped vial of my blood to a second paramedic. This woman raised the vial to her lips, taking a delicate sip.

1p1svs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/EU5/comments/1p1svs8/trade_mechanics_and_strategy/,Trade Mechanics and Strategy,"There has been a lot of discussion on trade so I spent a few hours reading through tool tips and playing with console commands to figure out trade mechanics and thought about ""What should you do to make money with trade?"" And this is what I've come up with. The first part is talking about trade mechanics, while the second will be a brief (and likely obsolete soon) strategy discussion.

Some of you may know the discussion around trade and how it increases your tax base (and thus expenses) more than you can reasonably generate in revenue. With low margin trades technically losing you money if you spend money on sliders and increasing the cost of events. This is not about that. I'll link the discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EU5/comments/1ozpr76/trade_is_completely_useless_now_after_105/), and this is being changed in 1.07 ([PDX source](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/tinto-talks-89-19th-of-november-2025.1876786/unread)).

Here are 5 important goods/trade/market mechanics that aren't immediately obvious.

# Mechanics

1.Prices

The prices for a good can range from:

1. 10% - 300% of base price in Ages 1-2
2. 10% - 400% of base price in Age 3
3. 10% - 500% of base price in Age 4-6

2.Effective supply and demand

* Locally produced/consumed goods have normal impact on price and demand (100%).
* Burgher import/exported goods have 75% impact on price and demand.
* ""Country"" trades have a 50% impact on price and demand. <- this is what you do.

As a case study on prices:

* If I locally produce 30 wool in a market and locally demand 30 wool, then the market price will be at equilibrium as supply = demand
   * 30 = 30, so price for wool would be the base price of 2.5

In this example the Burghers are the only source of supply in this market. The effective supply 'sees' 75% of that and so the market price is increased relative to base 100% of the demand is satisfied, but the price increases relative to base. 

If you were to import 2 copper (instead of the burghers) the effective supply would be 1, and the price would rise to 4 (base of 2) instead of the 3.5 in the screenshot.

https://preview.redd.it/xbiwwnlh0c2g1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=3216febd9fc33e071779240e03bdd7816ebae5df

In this example the 'nation' is the only one importing coffee, we import 1.4 units, however the effective supply is only 0.52, as such the price remains high. (I couldn't find an easy example with 100% of the demand being satisfied too)

https://preview.redd.it/ms8m1b9i0c2g1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=212740f4077e3900509de494779e653a0f769559

3. Good Production and RGO

RGOs always produce goods while employed. 1 level produces 1 good (before modifiers like traditional economy or techs).

Buildings produces less goods based on market access. If you build a building that produces 1 good, but the building has 67% market access, then you will produces 0.67 goods with 0.67 of the inputs as well.

https://preview.redd.it/ui1hx7mk0c2g1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=0118771c7ec79423b567c45a1ae364b435408eef

**Control DOES NOT affect the goods produced in either RGOs or buildings**, but it does decrease the amount of tax base you get from that location.

4. Pop Demand

Every pop demands certain goods. This is a good thing for you, as pops buying goods keeps prices high and allows you to continue to have profitable buildings. The needs profile changes either through ages, development, or money the pops have, I'm not 100% sure which. Pop needs have different profiles different parts of the world. 

https://preview.redd.it/afzjmsom0c2g1.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a0c3dd0f67471300182d04274bf82df34a7accc

https://preview.redd.it/qqwl7l8n0c2g1.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5872d302a357aac70c4ffea00e08f8fa9f26b6b

To see these images go to the demography section of a location. Hover over the pop type you're interested in (Nobles). Hover of the name of one (Norman Anglican Nobles), then numbers in the need section.

Certain regions don't have weights for certain goods, like your peasants preference for food resources is different in Europe (wheat) vs China (Rice).

There are a couple ways to increase demand for pop goods.

* Pops demand more goods, up to 6x if they are in a province with high development.
* They also demand more of a good if that good is produced as an RGO in their market (10%).
* They also demand a different variety goods if they have more money, that is the price of their base needs are filled, then they will get access to additional needs like mercury or masonry.

5. Trade Efficiency

Trade efficiency affects the amount of money you get from a trade. This does not effect the price of goods in any way.

https://preview.redd.it/m5asp5yo0c2g1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1e5cb342ca914ef69d586e4757465d48d3d6f06

In this example 13.14 cloves should only sell for 124 ducats at that market price. 

This is a 'free money' modifier essentially as it does not increase any costs such as maintenance costs or input costs. I think it could be an interesting strategy to move large volumes of goods *(like pushing 200+ unites of spices through multiple trade nodes that are strong (have lots of trade capacity) to take advantage of 10% trade efficiency on each trade - this is untested)*

# Strategy

This will likely change soon, but I think I should mention it because people seem to be struggling with trade.

The main way to make money with trade is satisfy pop needs for luxury stuff that you cannot produce yourself (in that market).

Why? Because the AI builds all the production buildings in all the markets, meaning their is some local supply of basically everything keeping the prices relatively low. On top of that, most non-luxury resources have low prices (1-3) meaning the margins for trade are quite small unless the price is exorbitantly expensive.

Trades for luxury goods are that exorbitantly expensive because there is usually a large chunk of demand 10-30 goods and quite literally 0 local supply.

1.  Get trade advantage in desirable markets that have one or ideally more of these characteristics.
   * Easily accessible market capital, like one on the coast
   * Lots of sea zones so you can project maritime presence and get trade advantage that way
   * Easily transportable goods (spices) 
   * High value goods with demand in your empire
   * Easily accessible/developed/high pop coastal regions - delete their useless production buildings and max trade buildings there
2. Get trade advantage in a market by
   * Making friends with the owner (+100 opinion) so they will let you build Trade Offices (Urban Only)
   * Have higher power projection so you can build Overseas Trading Posts (rural only and must be overseas)
   * The buildings give almost no trade advantage, but they do allow you to ""Patrol the Seas"" with light ship fleets, giving trade advantage based on how many pops live off a given coast. Patrolling near highly populated coasts gives lots of trade advantage, like the Nile delta, while patrolling uninhabited islands gives almost none.
3. Examples of weak or desirable markets
   * The Baltic - lots of coast and furs
   * Niani (Mali) - very weak, lots of coast, high pops, gold and ivory
   * All the Americas have weak markets
   * Mexico which have chili, cocoa, gold/silver - very very strong to get all of Mexico
   * Alexandria - huge demand for goods through its massive pop, and has high trade capacity meaning it can pull goods from India easily
   * India/China/Japan/Korea - huge pop, insane resources, lots of coast. The crown jewel of any run

Side note: Trade has a limited ability to stimulate your market by exporting goods since they only contribute 50% demand when calculating the price. This makes it very hard to raise the prices of certain goods so the buildings remain profitable. Especially as there is unlikely to be an AI country that has enough demand that you can run profitable trades to float an industry. A much better way is increase demand in your market, either through pop demands or other buildings. 

Trade is one way that you can get value out of land you conquer but can never reasonably core or push control to.

When you have the advantage in a market you can use goods from those markets to satisfy demand in your 'core markets' like the one your capital is probably in. If you are not doing this then the trades available to your market will only be 'general purpose' goods that can be made everywhere with low margins.",6,1763609780.0,EU5,1,1.0,False
1p1svhc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1svhc,Soil mix,"Next season I’ll be filling some raised beds for dahlias and other annual flowers (but mostly dahlias, so I’d like to cater to their needs). I’m aware that many of us who opt for raised beds don’t actually need them (our soil is perfectly suitable for growing, I just need to appease my parents’ like for things to be tidy and organized, so no “farm”-like rows in the yard), so raised beds it is. I’m also well aware that I can cut some corners and save on costs by filling the bottoms of beds with bulk, non-soil organic matter (which I plan to do) and that cheaper soil works just as well, but I would like to support this local family business.

Should I fill with entirely with the ‘premium blend’ soil? A mixture of soil and compost (what I assume is best)? And, as I understand it, dahlias do best with nitrogen-poor composts so as to promote better blooms and less foliage. Which compost is better? They have a compost that’s 100% leaves and I’ve already ruled that out.

I know I’m probably doing more than is needed, but I want input! I grew this past season in grow bags filled with 50:50 FoxFarm Happy Frog : Espoma Mushroom Compost and that worked perfectly (seemingly) for nutrients and water retention.

Becca had reached the first island. She'd been searching fruitlessly for nearly 40 minutes when she heard them. The bells. Being so much closer now, they were even clearer. She fell to her knees, letting their sensation, their warmth, wash over her. For a moment, she knew bliss.

The bells rolled back, like the ocean at low tide. Becca found herself shivering on the ground. She could hear nothing but frogs and crickets.

She rose on unsteady legs, sure of only one thing. In an hour she'd be there, she'd be standing before the Spire. She'd hear the bells, feel them, up close. She ran to the shore and dove into the waters.

Becca emerged from the reservoir onto the rocky bank of the second, and far larger, island. She stumbled barefoot through the woods, increasingly aware of how dark it was beneath the trees. As the bells' siren call faded in her mind, she began to doubt herself. The Island was nearly two miles long and a half mile across, she could search it all night and never find a damn thing.

The bells chimed once more. She turned to face them. There it was. In the center of a grove of dead trees, the Spire jutted out from the ground like a pike set to receive a charge. Its white paint was oddly untouched by age. Small windows adorned each of its sides. Framed by the dead trees and bathed in moonlight, it called.

Unable to resist their song, yet too overwhelmed by their warmth to walk, Becca crawled to the Spire like an infant to its mother. She pushed against the slats of the window. They gave way and she squirmed her way inside.

Becca landed on the top of a staircase. As the bells continued to chime, she pulled her shuddering body down the stairs, deeper and deeper into the enveloping darkness within, until she lost herself once more in the ethereal sounds and their radiating warmth.

Once the silence returned, Becca strained in vain to see. The air was humid, and black as ink. She could feel wood, dank and rotting, pressed against her bare calves. It gave her the impression she was sitting cross-legged inside of a living thing, like Jonah in the whale.

Slowly, Becca rose to her feet. She held her hands out in front of her and groped blindly. She hoped she'd find a wall or a banister to the stairs, anything that would give her a clue about her surroundings. Instead she found nothing, forcing her to shuffle deeper into the impermeable darkness.

Her outstretched fingers recoiled from the soft surface they encountered. What was it? She shook as she reached out, letting her hands land once more on the chest-high object in front of her.

It was wrapped in cloth. It only extended out to about the width of her shoulders. The cloth hung loose over something hard that her hands couldn't identify. Rods? Dowels? Her probing fingers traced up the object's outer edge until she felt something she could identify. She froze. Her fingers were in the eye socket of a skull. Her thumb rested on its teeth.

The bells rang again, if only inside Becca, as her mind's eye showed her the endless dance. She'd sat there in the dark, her unseeing eyes transfixed by the clockmaker's husband as he was dragged on his post through the twirling gauntlet of Union automatons. She saw him, alive and dead, the blush of youth, the maggots of decay, twitch and scream and moan as his body was pierced by countless bayonets. She saw his face as he ran the endless race.

Becca shrank and shriveled, collapsing to the floor. Like a wounded animal, she crawled and clawed her way back. Back, back, back. Until she hit the wall, and even then she didn't stop but pushed against it with all her strength, hoping to retreat further.

Her flailing limbs struck a step, the first of many. With what little control she had over her frenzied mind, bolted for the surface, and an escape from the moist pit. And the clockmaker's husband.

Becca scrambled up the twisting stairs on all fours like a dog. She tore her way through the window and collapsed on the ground. The fresh air felt alien in her lungs, as if it were her first breath. She took two more as she lay there on the ground, before realizing that although she hadn't a clue what time it was, she couldn't be there when the bells chimed.

""She ran and swam and ran and swam and didn't look back again until she was in the car."" Tally put her face in her hands. ""I shouldn't have let her go alone.""

""So you believe her?"" I tried to say it in as comforting a tone as I could, but I think it came out a little accusatory.

Tally hesitated. ""Yeah. Yeah, I do.""

I had so many more questions I wanted to ask, but I didn't think Tally could take it. She'd choked up several times while relaying Becca's story, and the way her shoulders were slumped reminded me of the way Becca's parents had looked at their daughter's funeral.

""I should have gone with her,"" she said, without looking up at me.

I let it lie.

As I left Tally's house, every hair on my body was standing on end, but at that point, as much as I wanted to, I still wasn't ready to accept the story of the Spire in the Woods. Not at face value. When we'd studied The Fall of the House of Usher in English earlier that year, Mrs. Thorn had made it a point to draw our attention to two of Poe's opium references and to how Roderick Usher displayed symptoms of withdrawal. She explained that Poe's stories frequently incorporated both blatant and subtle references to intoxicants and hallucinogens, in order to enhance the sense of phantasmagoria and help more skeptical readers suspend their disbelief.

I knew very little about depression and even less about antidepressants, but at the time, I didn't think it was beyond the realm of possibility that Rebecca Louise Kennan's encounter with the clockmaker's husband had more to do with the sudden onset of a major depressive episode than with a dead man. I spent the night reading about depression, tricyclics, MAO inhibitors, and SSRIs.

There were no answers, just endless possibilities. It wasn't unheard of for major depressive episodes to be accompanied by delusions or even outright hallucinations. Psychotic disorders were sometimes less obvious in patients whose presenting problem was depression. Hallucinations were rare side effects of SSRIs. MAO inhibitors could cause Serotonin Syndrome, which could cause hallucinations. And that was before getting into the countless drug interactions, which, without knowing exactly what Becca had been taking, I couldn't even begin to map out.

I knew Scary Kevin would love to hear every last detail Tally had told me about the Spire in the Woods, but on Tuesday morning I just didn't feel like tracking him down. I wanted to talk to Alex.

The ride into school hadn't been as awkward as I had anticipated. Tally was quieter than usual, and I was content to stare out my window and daydream about what I was going to tell Alex. I wondered what he'd think about Tally's story and whether or not I should gloss over my own doubts.

I also wondered if he'd cry. I feel embarrassed, even all these years later, admitting it, but a part of me was hoping he would. Then I'd have an excuse to hug him again. I could be dependable. Comforting. Girlfriend material. It was the kind of fantasy that marked me as a beta-female. The sort of girl who, even in her own daydreams, couldn't think of a single reason she deserved the boy.

I roved the juniors' hallway and the cafeteria but couldn't find Alex anywhere. I heard from DeLuca that he'd called out sick. I spent the rest of the day in a funk.

Kevin and I had gym 7th period, the last class of the day. It was too cold to go out to the fields, so we had to choose between three or four indoor activities. Ordinarily I'd have opted for floor hockey, the only gym class activity I have ever enjoyed, but I felt obligated to update Kevin on what I'd learned about Becca and the Spire, so I joined him in the auxiliary gym for a little ping-pong, a game I had no idea he was so good at.

""Or it could have happened exactly like that,"" Kevin said, acing me for the third straight time.

I was surprised that Scary Kevin wasn't as skeptical as I was. I mean, sure, Kevin absolutely believed in ghosts and, of course, I desperately wanted to; but we weren't completely credulous about every story we heard. We didn't relish wandering around graveyards and old buildings for no good reason. We weren't looking to kill time. We did it because we wanted to find something. We wanted to pull back the curtain and glimpse the grandeur of creation. We wanted to feel small in the presence of the infinite and know, if only for a moment, there was more than food, sex, and the petty minutiae of social interaction.

What it came down to was that while I believed Tally, and I believed that Tally believed Becca, it didn't follow that I believed Becca. It was the difference between lying and just being wrong. Kevin and I had developed criteria for identifying the more promising leads, and the Spire in the Woods had a lot going against it. Secondhand accounts. Stories with an undercurrent of social control. Witnesses with a history of mental illness. These were red flags, and Becca's story had all of them.

""You wanna check it out?""

""It's kinda cold for a swim.""

""I just wanna see if we can hear the bells.""

""Yeah, maybe. I dunno. It's kinda far.""

Of course, there was another reason I was reluctant to head all the way out to the Quabbin Reservoir with Scary Kevin. He looked at me like I had just insulted him; he knew precisely what my other reason was. Our last ghost hunting expedition had been a disaster. A very personal disaster.

Kevin was old for our year. He turned 16 at the tail end of freshman year and had gotten his license the very first day of summer break. It was perfect, save for one thing: no car.

Kevin's parents were divorced, and his mom had moved to New Jersey for a job. She paid her alimony and child support every month, but she just wasn't a very wealthy woman. Kevin's dad had never gone to college. He had to work full-time at the deli counter at our local Market Basket just to make ends meet, which meant, most days, he had the car.

But at night, when the store was closed, Kevin had access to the world's oldest, crappiest station wagon. For the most part, Kevin's newfound freedom changed his life very little. Mainly, his trips involved picking up the members of his small group of friends and delivering them to Dan Burgen's to watch anime and old horror movies in his basement. We only hung out twice that summer; both times Scary Kevin picked me up in what I called 'Ecto-1,' and we went ghost hunting.

Our first trip was to the Blood Cemetery. That's how we discovered the story of Abigail Blood was a steaming load. We dressed in all black (par for the course in Kevin's case) and brought flashlights, wax paper, and crayons. I also took the silver crucifix my parents had given me as a first communion present and my mother's Bible, just in case we saw something. It was fun scrambling over the old stone wall, sneaking through the cemetery with our flashlights held low, trying not to step on anybody's grave.

Even after seeing that the years of death didn't line up, we still checked out the curve where the ghost of the little boy supposedly ran out in front of passing cars. The blind curve was indeed full of skid marks. It also had, about twenty feet in front of it, a ""Deer Crossing"" sign.

Two or three weeks later, we went to a charity auction at the rec center and slipped up the stairs to the attic. The stairs squeaked beneath our feet and even though, at worst, we'd just be thrown out of the rec center, we were terrified of getting caught.

The attic hadn't changed in the seven or so years since my last visit. A couple of card tables housed bins full of crafting materials, a pair of filing cabinets sat against the back wall gathering dust, and most importantly of all, despite it being June, there were still cold spots.

We'd stand just outside of one, reach an arm in, and try to define the boundary of the warm and cold air. It was tricky. The shift in temperature wasn't as great as I remembered from when I was a kid and there were no hard, fine edges between the hot and the cold air. The temperature just seemed to bleed from one area into another, like brine in an estuary.

I experimented sticking my crucifix into the heart of the cold spot, and felt nothing. If anything, it felt like the cold spots were fading away. Kevin suggested we tried talking to the 'spirit' of Jonathan Michael Wilkins while we still could.

I shrugged. ""After you.""

We'd forsaken most of our ghost hunting kit as it would have been awfully conspicuous carrying around a Bible and a couple of flashlights. I still had my crucifix, but I doubted it'd be necessary. The stories of the Silver Specter were all quite tame. We had, however, brought a couple of sticks of incense, which we lit with a very old Zippo that had once belonged to my grandfather. Kevin had bought the incense from a new-age store, the sort of place you'd shop at if you were inclined to believe in Neo-Paganism or healing crystals. The salesman told him it was supposed to make it easier for spirits to pass into our realm, but to me, it just smelled like sandalwood.

Kevin spoke in a lilting tone, ""Jonathan, are you here with us?""

I burst out laughing and Kevin went beet red. He punched me in the arm and whispered for me to be quiet, pointing to the floor where beneath our feet the auction was taking place.

Kevin tried again, ""Jonathan, if you can hear me, give us a sign!""

We stood still in absolute silence, waiting for an answer. It came in the form of the industrial air conditioner, mounted to the ceiling of the floor below us, cycling on. A few gaps in the floor boards lined up perfectly with one of the AC's large vents. We couldn't stop laughing as 'the spirit of Jonathan Michael Wilkins' returned the cold spots to full force.

Once we'd regained our composure, Kevin and I decided to head over to Bickford's for a bite to eat while we conducted the post-mortem on our latest failure. Now, a deer crossing sign and an air conditioner don't necessarily disprove that the Blood Cemetery and our town rec center are haunted, but they certainly had made us feel rather foolish, so while I gorged myself on eggs Benedict (which I had only recently discovered) and Kevin nursed a cup of coffee, we started tossing around ideas for other expeditions.

""No place local."" He said. ""Gotta stay objective. It can't be some place we've grown up thinking's haunted.""

""You just don't want anyone we know hearing your little sing-talking-to-the-spirit-world voice.""

Kevin, in mock anger, reached over, grabbed a home fry off of my plate, and threw it at me. It had taken him a long time to get comfortable with me teasing him. I guess after a lifetime of being mocked about his weight and appearance, the idea that it was the only way I expressed affection took some getting used to.

There were a few places in and around Boston we wanted to check out, but most of them were landmarks or buildings that were still in use. Neither of us was eager to get arrested, particularly not Kevin who was going to have a hard enough time getting into college; so Boston was out, and most of Lowell too. We dismissed a couple of nearby leads: the Gilson Road Cemetery, which had no actual history surrounding it, just a hodgepodge of random urban legends, and the Blue Lady out in Wilton, NH, who sounded somewhat promising but was most frequently sighted during harvest moons, which we wouldn't get until late September.

Eventually we settled on the Eunice Williams Covered Bridge in Greenfield, Massachusetts. It had everything going for it: a traumatic death, consistent sightings, and no air conditioning. The only downside was that, for us, Greenfield was a solid two-hour drive each way, and that was if the MapQuest directions were up to date (a mighty big ""if"").

I didn't see Kevin again that summer. Life just got in the way. For Kevin, it was difficult to work around his dad's schedule, especially after a tiny little accident he had backing out of a space at the mall resulted in his losing his driving privileges for a month. While for me, it was the pool Kristy McDowell's parents had put in that June. While my feelings for Kristy and our other mutual female friends were mostly platonic, I was fifteen, and they were in bikinis. By comparison, ghost hunting just didn't seem quite as exciting. Knowing how my friends felt about him, I never invited Kevin to tag along. Of course, in fairness to me, pool parties weren't exactly his cup of tea.

When school started up again in the fall, Kevin and I resumed talking about our trip to Greenfield, but it wasn't until Becca Kennan killed herself and I made an effort to spend more time with him that we got around to actually going. Kevin picked me up early one Friday evening in mid-November. Mr. Peterson had opened the store that morning and would be closing the next day, meaning we had Ecto-1 all night. We just needed to get the car back before he woke up and he'd be none the wiser.

Driving around with friends was still novel at that point in my life. The two hours passed by in a blur of jokes and gossip and screaming along to what little music Kevin and I could agree on. He used to have this mix tape dominated by Nine Inch Nails and Rage Against the Machine that was a staple of our time in Ecto-1. I think we listened to it straight through two and a half times that night.

We only got turned around once, and arrived at the Eunice Williams Covered Bridge absolutely pumped. We pulled into the bridge, cut the motor, honked once and waited for Eunice.

Eunice Williams was not a resident of Greenfield. She had actually lived in nearby Deerfield, back in the late 1600s. At the time, Deerfield was the northwesternmost outpost of New England, deep in the heart of the former Pocumtuck nation.

Before the settlers had arrived in Deerfield, the Pocumtuck had already been weakened by European diseases and war with the Mohawk People. When the settlers and Pocumtuck clashed over resources, the settlers easily drove the remaining Pocumtuck from their land.

The Pocumtuck, however, were not ready to admit defeat. They allied themselves with French settlers and other French-aligned First Peoples in Canada and, in 1704, led an offensive raid against Deerfield's English settlers. The French and Native Americans killed 56 settlers and burned much of the town to the ground. They captured over a hundred survivors, and forced them to march through brutal winter conditions into Quebec. The march would take months.

Among the captured survivors was Eunice Mather Williams, her husband, Minister John Williams, and five of their seven children. Her infant daughter and six-and-a-half-year-old son were both killed during the raid, but John and Eunice were determined to be strong for their other children and fellow captives. The Williamses quoted scripture, led the group in prayer, and took turns carrying their younger children until they reached the Green River.

Eunice fell during the crossing.

Despite having survived her plunge, a Pocumtuck warrior decided that Eunice's exposure to the icy water had weakened her too much to continue the march, so he hacked her to pieces in front of her husband and their remaining children.

Legend has it that Eunice appears on the bridge over the waters where she was killed, asking any mortals she finds there of news about her children and husband. Locals say she can be summoned simply by cutting your engine and honking your horn.

We'd been sitting there in Ecto-1 with the engine off and no heat, when a thought occurred to me: ""Why would the ghost of a woman who died a couple of centuries before the invention of the automobile respond to a horn being honked?""

I could see the gears turning in Scary Kevin's head as he processed the anachronism. ""Well...maybe she's just...fuck!""

I laughed as Kevin turned on the car to get the heat going again. ""And you couldn't've thought of this before we drove out here?"" he asked.

""Well, doesn't mean the bridge isn't haunted. Just that Eunice probably isn't a car gal.""

We waited for a bit, then got out of the car and poked around the bridge on foot. I've always liked covered bridges, ever since seeing Disney's the Legend of Sleepy Hollow cartoon as a kid, and there's a nifty little plaque at this one that tells the whole story of Eunice Williams.

We scrambled down to the banks of the river. It's not exactly the Mississippi, but it was easy to see how difficult it would have been to ford, especially under the strained circumstances Eunice was facing. I skipped a few pebbles, a difficult feat in fast-moving water, before we got cold and decided to return to the car.

Maybe it was the increasingly likely prospect that another of our missions was going to prove to be a waste, or maybe it was just the hour and the warm air of the heater blasting in our faces and making us sleepy, but whatever the cause, our energy was fading fast and our conversation had turned serious. Well, serious by high school standards.

""Do you think Kim Murray is pretty?""

Kim Murray. I did not think she was pretty, but that put me in a precarious position. Physically Kim had her faults, but, objectively speaking, she was significantly more attractive than Kevin, a boy Drew DeLuca once described, with what was for Drew a considerable amount of sympathy, as ""unfortunate-looking.""

Kevin shifted in his seat to face me.

""I dunno. Never gave it much thought, I guess. Why?""

""We were at Dan's the other night, and she was talking about how much she likes knowing that guys masturbate while thinking about her.""

""Yeah, I don't think this is a topic of conversation I want to pursue.""

Kevin grunted softly. ""That's what I said. It's kinda gross."" There was a pause. When Kevin spoke again, his voice caught in his throat. ""And then Kim said, 'Well then, I guess you're lucky you don't have to worry about anyone doing it over you.'""

My cheeks burned with embarrassment. I didn't know what to say. I never imagined Kevin would share his sexual insecurities with me, in part because I never thought of him in sexual terms. On some level, I don't think it ever fully processed for me that Kevin was a boy, like Alex or the other guys I was interested in. That's not to say I was confused about his gender identity, but that, because I found him unattractive, my mind had neutered him, had significantly reduced him as a human being.

Kevin started to cry and I leaned over to give him a hug. He let a few hushed sobs out into my shoulder as I patted his broad back. At some point he stopped crying. It took me a second to notice, but what I thought was him taking a shuddering breath, or maybe just a tear-covered cheek sliding over my skin, was actually Kevin kissing my neck.

I wanted to leap into the backseat, to lurch away from Kevin and retreat into the furthest recess of Ecto-1. I wanted to throw open my door, sprint to the nearest house and demand that its occupants permit to shower. But I couldn't do that. As revolted as I was that my actions and intentions had been so wildly misconstrued, Kevin was still my friend. And he was vulnerable, and he didn't deserve that.

I froze, hoping he'd realize I wasn't reciprocating. The nuzzling and kissing continued. I guess he didn't, or maybe he didn't realize that this was a red flag— we never spoke about what happened in Greenfield— but either way, he needed a clearer stop sign. I put my hands on his shoulders and gently pushed myself away from him.

He got the message.

""I just...I don't...I don't think of you like that..."" I had trouble spitting it out.

He nodded.

""We're friends,"" I said.

""Uh-huh.""

The trip home was one of the longest car rides of my life. Kevin never turned on the radio. The only words out of my mouth were the turns I called out off of our Mapquest directions.

I felt shallow. I think we both knew that I'd only said, ""we're friends"" to soften the blow. I wouldn't have dismissed the affections of any of my other male friends so readily. Even some of the guys I'd been friends with since elementary school, I would never have pushed away like that.

The following Monday, I made it a point to talk to Kevin in class like nothing had happened. He played along for a bit, but then asked me for a little space. Frankly, I was relieved to give it to him.

I only told a couple of people about Scary Kevin kissing my neck. DeLuca thought it was hilarious. He wasn't the most sensitive guy in the world. Kristy was a bit more sympathetic. She reminded me I was entitled to have my tastes. I appreciated hearing it, but I still felt like a shit. I had set out to make Kevin feel better about himself, and had done nothing of the kind. And I never thought of myself as the sort of girl who'd judge a boy based on his looks, but apparently I was.

Alex didn't return to school for a whole week after our last conversation. He told everyone who asked that he'd had the flu, but later confessed to me that he couldn't take being surrounded by people. Too noisy. Too overwhelming. Too many eyes staring at him. He needed to be alone.

I didn't see him at lunch that day, or ever again. The anxiety he felt being surrounded by people was at its worst when he was trying to eat. So his parents arranged for him to eat in his guidance counselor's office. When I found out, I knew it was good for Alex, but I couldn't help but feel like my days would be a little drearier without being able to see him across the cafeteria. His wild hair. That smirk (if it ever returned). And that was to say nothing of the wonder that years of track and cross country had done for his legs.

I finally caught up with him on Friday morning. He was at his locker. To cut down on the amount of time he had to spend jammed between chatty classmates, Alex had taken to cramming every book and binder he'd need until lunch into his backpack. He looked like a freshman.

""Hey, Alex.""

He didn't look up. ""Oh, hey,"" he mumbled.

I dropped down next to where he was crouching, and lowered my voice. ""I spoke with Tally.""

Alex froze. I couldn't tell if he was nervous or excited. He took a couple of deep breaths as he turned towards me. ""Did you see it?""

""Yeah. Basically said the same thing as yours."" He deflated, but I continued. ""But then she told me what happened. You gonna be at lunch?""

He bit his lower lip as he considered for a second. ""No.""

""Oh. Well, we could—""

""What do you have last period?""

""Just gym.""

""Can you skip it?""

I'd never cut a class in my life. ""Absolutely.""

Other pointlessly gendered urges...As my ex put it anyway, I read this creepypasta when it initially came out and cried. Both Alina and Kerry, now Alex and Kevin mirror my own experiences as a ""female"" growing up. I'm not universally attractive like Alina/Alex but I definitely dealt with someone putting everything on me emotionally, and such a sense of guilt for having driven someone to the point of suicidal ideation affects you in ways that will continue for Alex their entire life. I will try to wait until it comes, but the part where the accident is, for me I feel was to write the female characters out of the story because the author thought they couldn't write females. I think it also allows us to slowly recognize that the narrator isn't the victim here. There is not really even a line where you can separate the two.

Me and bf have been discussing Chainsaw Man. I love it, but every time they make women into characters who are these kind of villains with no real emotions I know they think that women are something different from men fundamentally and people are individualistic. Cold men and women exist and these delicately painful experiences aren't gender specific.",1,1763609228.0,u_CrowInTheRoseGarden,0,1.0,False

We moved to Sioux Falls from Texas a few years ago(I was born and raised in the Midwest though), and something we keep running into—both personally and from talking with others—is how hard it can be to make friends here. People are nice, but the social circles can feel a little closed-off, especially if you’re new to town. I even spoke with one woman that ended up moving back because they had such a hard time meeting people.

I’m hearing from other newcomers that putting together some super casual mixers or meetups specifically for newcomers (or really anyone looking to meet new people) is needed. Nothing salesy or structured—just a friendly space to connect.

Before we start planning anything, I wanted to check with r/siouxfalls:

Would you be interested in attending a newcomers’ meetup/mixer?
And if so, what kind of setting would you prefer (coffee shop, brewery, park, etc.)?

He works construction, earns good money, but thinks anything creative is a joke. Every holiday he’d ask, loudly, in front of everyone:
“So kid, still wasting money on that finger-painting degree?”
Or
“Any jobs in staring at walls yet?”

It made every family gathering feel like a performance review.

Anyway, senior year of art school comes around and I have to prep my final exhibit. My professor encourages us to make something personal. That week, Uncle Tim made another comment, something like:
“If art majors worked half as hard as real workers, they wouldn’t be broke.”

So I decided fine. Let’s make art about him.

My exhibit included a series called “Portraits of Blue-Collar Fragility.” Each portrait wasn’t of my uncle’s face, but of objects that represented his insults:
• A chipped coffee mug that said “World’s Best Expert”
• A toolbox filled with children’s toys
• A construction helmet made of papier-mâché newspaper articles about toxic masculinity
• A plaque titled “Things That Scare Him More Than Heights,” listing things like “therapy,” “queer people,” and “my success.”

It was subtle enough that strangers viewed it as clever social commentary…
But my family? Yeah, they recognized every detail immediately.

At the opening, Uncle Tim walked around with the same expression people have when they realize the bathroom stall door doesn’t lock, trapped, horrified, and pretending everything is fine. He didn’t say one word to me.

Next family gathering?
He asked me about my job prospects respectfully.
He even apologized, the quiet, awkward kind where he looked at the floor the whole time.

1p1snhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1p1snhe/my26m_life_is_ruined/,My[26M] life is ruined,"For the most of my life, there has never been a week where my mother and father haven't fought brutally. My mother has suffered a lot from my father's family side, being beaten, tortured, made to do labour during pregnancy etc. But my father has never ever taken her side even once, never did he take a side for her and always insisted her to get along with it, sometimes even shouting at her for complaining. Things have gone out of hands in the last 6-7 years where they've faught so bad my mother decided to attempt to hang herself at night and we managed to stop her. No matter how much I shout at my father to understand her situation he just doesnt budge, he looks at me silently, god knows what goes inside his head. He has never apologised for anything ever from his heart. It is safe to say he is heartless.

Lately me and my mother moved to a different state for my work, I bought a home (on loan) and we both live here. My father comes a visits us every other month. And whenever he comes here, things start ruining. My mom goes into panic attacks, she becomes unable to feel the right side of her body, she shouts, she cries and nothing comes out of it. During any festival, if my mother is happy and all, he suddenly gives her a death stare out of nowhere. If at night my mother feels that she is tired and decides to skip the dishes, he keeps bringing it up IDK why. I earn very well (I pay around 12L/year in taxes alone), still he steals stationaries and hardware from his workplace and brings them here. He is kanjoos, but this is not a reason to steal. Last time, he stole a small banana plant from a neighbour for laxmi pooja (this comes for around 200-300Rs), he bought army liquor to give his friend here for a profit. But when it comes to his side of the family, he never even opens his mouth, he is the eldest son still he let go of his property to his brother who is one of who tortured my mother mentally during her pregnancy. My mother has repeatedly talked to him to not do all this, that we have let go of everything we had to his side of family, now lets forget about them and let us live peacefully. But all of this... for nothing. Things keep falling apart day after day.

And my mother, she loves me a lot. I am the only one for her. Her side of family is on bad terms with her, they sided with my father's side of family. She is in touch with her sister alone. I was in a relationship with this very beautiful person for 8 years (long distance for 6 years, then I move to work in her city, lucky me right?). Things escalated and we decided it is time for us to meet our parents and ask them about our marriage. Initial discussions were very positive, she met my mother and father, I met her mother, father and brother. Things were so perfect... just for them to fall apart. One day I decided to take my mother shopping, and my GF also joined us. For some reason, my mother felt left out there, we tried to join her, she started acting weird and all. When we dropped my GF at her home, I reminded her to take her medicines (she suffers from panic attacks as well due to her childhood trauma). While driving back home, my mother asked me if I know she takes thyroid medicines, I said yes I know. To which she said, if I know when she takes them? And on and on and on, she escalated it so much, she had a breakdown at home, she could not function properly. She said I left her alone when I was with my GF, that I've been coming home late from the office forgetting about her, and her health is ruining because of this. I somehow made her calm down and talked to my GF about this, she is very understanding and she understood that we can't meet everyday after work, so she started travelling 30-40 mins to my office every single day to meet me, just to hold my hands and talk about things for just 5 mins.

Things were still going good, and then around the new years, my GF's mother decided to invite me and my mother to their home for a lunch. She wanted to know about my side of the family because we have been discussing about marriage and all. We go there, it was all good, we had fun, we were happy, I rushed to the pooja room and I prayed to the god even if I am an atheist, I didn't want to risk anything, I didn't want someone to rob me of this happiness. And... someone did rob me out of it.

For the new year, I took a week's leave. I was at home with my mother. I used to talk to my GF over the phone because we could not meet. Then for the new years, I decided to take my GF on a date, and told my mother that I will be going out with my GF. Something triggered in her, and she went on an all out rage saying that I should not be going out before marriage and all, that it is a taboo how me and my GF hold hands and walk etc etc. To which I asked if it is wrong for people in love to meet each other? She still insisted on me not going, and I had to tell my GF that the plans were cancelled, she understood me and didn't complain. Fast forward to the day of the new year, 1st January, 2025 5:00 AM. I wake up, my mother wakes up we wish each other happy new year. Then she started going on another rant, that she doesn't like the way my GF always travels out of her home to have coffee outside, that she can't just go shopping everyday and take photos in the trial room and not buy anything, that it is wrong and weird. I asked what is wrong in that, and then she blows out of control, start shouting and all. I keep shut, waiting for her to stop ranting. She goes on till the next day. I could not talk to my GF for the entire day because my mother kept on ranting, and her health ruined, and she fell unconscious. Then she wakes up, I talk to her, and then I said, whatever it is, I will talk to my GF and make her understand about whatever she feels is wrong. She then goes on another rage, starts lying about my girl, and then I shouted at my own mother, to stop lying about my girl. This made her situation worse. The next day, she said, she would go back to my father's place, because she feels like she is ruining my relationship and life. She made me feel guilty about it. And I know she can't go to my father's place, with him is hell.

I try to talk to her, and she... she forces me to... she forced me to choose 1, to let her live, or stay in this relationship with my girl. We argued for 3 full days, and seeing her bad health. I told her I will talk to my GF about this, we will fix things. But she decided to take things on her own, and she called my GF before I could wake up, she walked up to the terrace of the home so that I could not hear her talk (which she never does), she calls her up and talks very badly to her. Blaming her for things, and her habits of having coffee outside, and the changing room thing. My GF was very confused because I didnt talk to her for 3-4 days, and then this. After my mom's call, I confronted her, and then she again reminded me, either she lives, or I go back to my GF.

I call my GF, try to calm her down, try to make her understand what happened. I told her I could not call her because my mother was not well, I had to take care of her, to which my ever understanding girl said, ""and what about me"". I was not man enough to take it. The call ended up badly, I came back down to the hall. Told my mother about the call, and then she made me finally decide it. She said that till February next year is the only time she has to truly live, because after that, my father retires and he will be living with us in this house. I gave up, and took my mother's side. I left my girl... alone, I let her down, broke all the promises we made, I robbed her of something she valued the most in her life, we promised to go to Greece after our marriage. All of it, for nothing. I messaged her saying that this is the end. She messaged me, called me a lot of times, I didn't respond. I told her it ends here, and not to come see me at my office.

This wretched family of mine, is making my life a hell. My mother asks me to marry someone by the next year. But does she not know how she behaved with the one I truly saw my future with? Does she not see how broken this house is for anyone to live in? I don't think I'm worthy to be with someone because I can't man it up and own up to my own goddamn words, which I said in full faith, by myself, not to just say it, but those... those words meant a lot to me... Yet I fail to keep them.

I just want to end this pain inside of me. I cant take this any more. I have nothing to lose, because I had everything that I could ask for, yet I lost everything that I had.",1,1763609089.0,TwentiesIndia,3,1.0,False

1p1sjm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p1sjm7/the_dark_psychology_of_social_manipulation_how/,The dark psychology of social manipulation: how people control you without you realizing,"Ever felt weird after a conversation but couldn’t explain why? Like how you suddenly agreed to something you didn’t want or started doubting yourself over something you were sure about? You’re not alone. Lately I've seen way too many people quietly drained by subtle manipulation, at work, in relationships, in group chats. It doesn’t look like gaslighting or toxic behavior because it’s wrapped in charm, flattery, or “just kidding.” But it’s real. And it works.

There’s a whole art behind it. And the wild part? Most manipulators don’t even know they’re doing it. They follow scripts that society rewards. Social media is full of “alpha” advice and fake psychology bites that legitimize manipulation as confidence. No wonder it’s hard to spot.

So I went deep. Books, psychology research, YouTube breakdowns, podcasts. Pulled together some key patterns and tactics that help you recognize and protect your boundaries. This is your street-smart guide to social manipulation, what it is, how it works, and how to guard your brain from being hijacked.

*Real knowledge = real protection. Let’s get into it.*

---

* **Gaslighting isn’t the only trick**
  * While gaslighting is widely known now (thanks TikTok), there’s a whole toolbox of quieter manipulation tactics.  
  * Harvard psychologist Dr. Amy Cuddy explains in her book *Presence* that power isn’t just about status, it’s about perception. Manipulators shift your perception of yourself without needing to insult you. They plant doubt. They reframe your memory. They play dumb so you feel crazy for catching on.  
  * Example: Somebody says, “Wow you’re *so intense* about that,” and suddenly you’re questioning your standards. This is called *emotional reframing*, and it works just like branding, change the words, change the meaning.

---

* **Strategic flattery is more dangerous than hate**
  * According to Dr. Robert Cialdini's *Influence*, one of the most powerful ways people gain compliance is with flattery, especially when it feels accidental.  
  * People who say things like “You’re so smart, I could never figure this out without you” subtly create a dynamic where your ego is now tied to helping them. They’re not complimenting, they’re binding you with praise.  
  * If flattery makes you feel “owed” to someone, that’s manipulation.

---

* **Microdebt makes you feel guilty**
  * This one is sneaky. You’re offered small favors constantly, coffee, covering a bill, listening to your rant. Then comes the ask. Now you feel like a bad person if you say no.
  * This is called *reciprocity debt*, a term Cialdini also discussed in his research. It’s why free samples lead to more purchases. But in friendships or relationships, it creates obligation where there should be autonomy.

---

* **Ambiguity creates control**
  * One tactic of manipulative personalities is to never define the relationship. They keep things vague, “We’re just vibing,” “Let’s not overthink this”, because ambiguity is power.  
  * Esther Perel, world-renowned psychotherapist, said in her podcast *Where Should We Begin?* that uncertainty breeds obsession. Manipulators keep you emotionally hooked by withholding clarity.  
  * If you’ve ever been stuck in a “what are we?” loop, just know, it’s not that they’re confused, it’s that ambiguity benefits them.

---

* **They overload your empathy**
  * Psychologist Martha Stout introduced the idea of *empathy hijacking* in her bestseller *The Sociopath Next Door*. Some people weaponize their vulnerability to make you override your instincts.  
  * They always have a sad story. They always had a rough childhood. They’re “trying.” So your brain pushes your boundaries aside.  
  * Real empathy involves two people. Manipulative empathy uses your compassion as a leash.

---

* **They hijack group dynamics to silence you**
  * In conflict, manipulators often rope in third parties or talk “to the group” instead of directly to you. If they can turn others against you subtly, they’ve won without confrontation.  
  * In a fascinating episode of *The Psychology of Evil* on Hidden Brain, social psychologist Philip Zimbardo breaks this down: humans will conform to group opinion to avoid isolation.  
  * If someone’s always making jokes at your expense when others are around, it’s not “just teasing”, it’s social power play.

---

Here’s some of the most powerful tools I’ve found that helped me understand the patterns and stop doubting my gut:

* **Book: *The Gift of Fear* by Gavin de Becker**
  * NYT Bestseller. One of the most powerful books on how intuition can save your life, literally.  
  * de Becker worked with victims of stalking and violence, and he shows how early warnings come as ""gut feelings"" we dismiss.  
  * This book made me rethink every interaction I brushed off as “weird but maybe I’m overthinking.”  
  * *This is the best street-level psychology book I’ve ever read. If you’ve ever said “I should’ve trusted my gut,” read this ASAP.*  

* **Documentary: *The Social Dilemma* on Netflix**
  * This isn’t about individual manipulators, but how social media manipulates all of us, and teaches others to do the same.  
  * Former insiders from Google, Facebook expose how manipulation isn’t a bug, it’s the product.  
  * *You’ll never scroll the same way again.*

* **Podcast: *The Huberman Lab* by Dr. Andrew Huberman**
  * Tons of episodes on how dopamine, narrative control, and emotional regulation influence our behavior.  
  * Especially the episode on stress and trust, explains how manipulators use timing and pressure to shape your decisions subtly.  
  * *It’s science-backed, down to the hormone level, but somehow still easy to listen to.*  

* **YouTube: JCS - Criminal Psychology**
  * Breakdowns of real interrogation footage that show manipulation tactics, gaslighting, and emotional control in action.  
  * Watch how suspects twist stories and deflect blame in real time.  
  * *If you want to see manipulation unfold second-by-second, these videos are gold.*  

* **App: BeFreed**
  * This is my favorite discovery of the year. I use it almost every day.  
  * It turns books, expert content, and real-world success stories into personalized learning podcasts tailored to your goals. Perfect if you want to build mental strength, emotional awareness, and social intelligence.  
  * You can customize the voice, like a smoky one that sounds like Samantha from *Her* or a sexy deep male voice. Makes learning addictive.  
  * It even has a smart character called Freedia, kind of like Duolingo but way smarter. You can ask her stuff, debate ideas, and track your learning.  
  * It creates a hyper-personalized learning roadmap and even journals what you internalize daily. Replaces doomscrolling with 20-minute brain upgrades. After 3 months, you’ll notice the difference in how sharp and calm you are in social situations.  
  * Built by a Columbia Univeristy team. Lots of content on manipulation, negotiation, and emotional clarity.

* **App: Finch**
  * Habit tracker but with a cute little bird avatar.  
  * It gently guides you into daily mental health routines, journaling, boundary-setting, micro-goals.  
  * If you feel drained after people-pleasing, this app helps you rebuild the habit of choosing yourself.

* **App: Ash**
  * AI journaling tool for emotional processing.  
  * Helps you write through social conflict, identify which patterns you keep repeating.  
  * Great if you’ve ever walked away from an interaction thinking “Why did I say yes again?” It reflects your thought loops back to you.

* **Course: MasterClass - *Chris Voss Teaches The Art of Negotiation***
  * Former FBI hostage negotiator. Teaches “tactical empathy” and how to protect your frame in every conversation.  
  * You’ll learn how to say no without conflict, how to read the room, and how to stay calm when someone’s trying to push your buttons.

I met my wife 3 years ago, fell madly in love and got married.  I adore her, she is sweet, funny, compassionate, kind and every other adjective to describe a wonderful human being.  

Until about 2 months ago.  She suddenly turned mean, rude, explosive, paranoid etc.  I assumed she was going through it so I supported her and tried my best to validate her emotions.  

7 days ago on Veteran’s Day, she told me she was going to Dollar Tree and asked if I wanted anything.  “I’d love a little sweet treat, maybe some gummy worms!”  She said cool and left to go shopping.  4 hours later she is not back, I was freaking out.  Not answering calls, not responding to texts.  12 hours go by.  I noticed there is no dollar tree charge on the bank acct, just a weird coffee shop transaction near Nashville.  (We live in Memphis like 3 hours away.)  I had to track her down 3 hours away when she finally answered the phone.  

Turns out, she was undergoing a manic episode I had to take her to a mental health facility where she was diagnosed bipolar 1.  Here we are a week later she is not the person I married anymore.  She is unbelievably mean and dismissive towards me.  Nothing I do is right or she is upset by me trying to help.  I genuinely feel as though I did everything right and now she doesn’t love me anymore.  I’m so goddamn tired of being anxious around the person I’m supposed to spend the rest of my life with.  

Once again, no clue why I’m writing this, just needed to get this off my chest in hopes I’ll actually sleep tonight maybe.

Just one letter, but it carried so much more than its shape. It was my way of keeping you close, of holding on to something of ours even when words failed me. Do you remember how we used to share jam links on Spotify, just so we could listen together? It became our quiet little ritual, kahit magkalayo tayo, it felt like we were side by side. I’d be cleaning in our house or fixing my things, while you were often tucked away in your coffee shop. I made that playlist especially for you, and the very first song was Butterflies by Abe Parker. Every time it plays, I’m reminded of that night I finally admitted to myself that I liked you.

You were standing outside your shop, and I had just finished my matcha. I asked my friend, “Ay, umuulan?” but it was you who answered. My smile gave me away, and all I could do was turn around, because I wasn’t wearing a mask that night. You used to say I was a snob for not talking to you, but the truth is, our eyes always carried the words we never spoke. That was the moment the lyrics hit me.

How do I tell you I need you

When you steal the breath in my lungs?

My body shakes 'til the blood in my face

Makes me awkward, smile, and turn around

There are memories etched so deeply in me that they still breathe, even now. Like that one quiet afternoon at your coffee shop. It was just the two of us, the kind of silence that isn’t empty but full of everything unspoken. You sat across from me, and my heart wouldn’t stop racing. I finished my drink too quickly, wishing I could stay longer, wishing time would bend for us. But then the shop filled with people, and duty pulled you away. As I left, Cowboy in LA played softly in my earbuds, as if the universe itself was teasing me with the words I never had the courage to say.

Let's skip the club, let's skip the crowd

Wanna take you on a date

I'll hold your hand, I'll hold the door

'Cause that's how I was raised…

Sweet memories, don’t you think? Especially that first night we met, November 20, 2023. I never believed in love at first sight, not really, but there was something undeniable about that spark between us. I was half-hidden behind my mask, and yet somehow, you still saw me. Later, we confessed we had both stolen glances at each other, like two magnets pretending not to notice the pull. For a fleeting moment, the world slowed, and it felt like it belonged only to us.

And then, there was our first kiss. It was quick, simple, and yet it made my heart race in a way I’d never felt before. I remember walking home afterward, smiling like an idiot, feeling so giddy that I kept replaying that moment in my head. It wasn’t just a kiss. It was the start of something that made me believe in connection, in timing, in the quiet magic between two people who just found each other.

But time changes everything. I know I once said meeting you was one of the biggest mistakes of my life, but that wasn’t true. I only said it out of anger, out of hurt. You already know why I had to act that way, even if I can’t say it here. It wasn’t because I stopped caring, or because what we had meant nothing. It was because I didn’t know how else to handle the pain. The truth is, meeting you was one of the most beautiful things that ever happened to me. And though it might be too late for apologies, please believe me when I say this now. I’m sorry. Truly, deeply sorry.

I’m sorry, too, for the lies I said, the ones I never intended to say or do. I know they hurt you, and I regret them more than I can ever express. If, in your heart, you ever find yourself regretting meeting me, please know that I understand. But still, I want you to know this. My feelings for you were always real. My love for you was, and will always be, sincere.

If I could ask for one impossible wish, it would be to return to the night we met. To relive it. To hold on tighter. To love you the way you deserved, without fear, without hesitation. But I can’t. And so I’m left with this aching truth. I love you still. I love you so much, it hurts.

I hope life is gentle with you. I hope the world offers you softness where I could not. And if fate is ever kind, may it let our paths cross once more, even if only for a moment, even if only to remind me that once, we had this. Once, I had you.",3,1763607658.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

The question I have starts here: Do you really need a ceremonial grade matcha for the best tasting drink?   
From my understanding as well as personal experience so far, standard culinary/ latte grade matcha honestly tastes fine. As long as you're not skipping prices so hard that you get the vomit colored powders, I haven't felt like the flavour or texture of your run of the mill matcha is that bad. BUT! with that in consideration, the matcha my coworker brought from japan tasted SUBSTANTIALLY better in both a latte as well as a cortado I made for myself. 

Lastly taking all that info, how far do you really need to go when purchasing a ceremonial grade matcha? Where's the start and where's the finish on quality and pricing.

I drink coffee occasionally and I did drink some today. I am a stressed individual normally but currently do have some active stressors in life. I grit my teeth in my sleep and have TMJ with a lot of pain behind my ears and where the upper and lower jaw connect.

I know this is not tooth related but I have been told by dentists to come in so they can check out my mouth about these bumps but they go away very quickly (maybe few hours or an hour, even minutes, unsure) and I never have time to come in when I notice them, they are random but appear closer to where my back teeth rub. They do not seem like canker sores because those last longer, I used to get them a lot when I was younger and I tend to get them when I’m super stressed.

I suddenly kneeled onto the floor.

There were still bloody holes in my knees.

""What the hel are you doing?!""

Chapter 1

I was in love with Roderick Cooke for seven years. When I was kidnapped, he didn't pay the ransom, all because his female secretary suggested using the opportunity to teach me a lesson—to make me behave.

I endured hellish torture and finally learned to stay away from Roderick. Yet, he cried and begged me for another chance.

\*\*\*

The day I walked barefoot back into the city, I made the news.

Camille Cantrell—the Cooke family's adopted daughter, kidnapped for months—had finally escaped. Dressed in rags, her feet lacerated and filthy, she had stumbled back to civilization.

Reporters swarmed, their camera flashes exploding around me. Facing the blinding glare, I felt nothing. I was already dead inside.

The Camille Cantrell of the past was gone. That bright, dazzling, willful, and vivacious girl had been destroyed—by the kidnappers, and by Roderick.

Soon, a group of black-clad bodyguards carved a path through the crowd. Their leader was Timothy Glisson. I knew him. During my seven years of pestering Roderick, it was always Timothy who had ""seen me off"" from Roderick's office and apartment.

""Seen me off"" was a polite term. More often, it involved dragging me out, a consequence of my persistence and Roderick's extreme repulsion toward me.

""Ms. Cantrell, Mr. Cooke is waiting for you in the car. This way.""

Timothy's gaze faltered as it landed on me. Clearly, I was far more wretched than he had anticipated.

I nodded and stepped forward on my injured feet. A trail of bloody footprints marked my path. The pain had long since numbed, and this short distance was nothing compared to my flight for survival.

Following behind me, Timothy couldn't help but call out, ""Ms. Cantrell...""

I didn't respond. Did he pity me? He should be relieved, in fact. After this ""lesson"", I would never pester Roderick again. And of course, I would no longer cause his job extra trouble.

When I stepped into the car, I saw Roderick in the back seat, eyes closed, resting. His dark hair was impeccably styled, his features exquisitely chiseled.

I imagined my absence had brought him unprecedented peace. Of course, he was in excellent condition.

Hearing the disturbance, Roderick slowly opened his eyes. For a moment, he didn't recognize me. ""Camille?""

I nodded obediently. Yes, I had learned to behave. Before, I had never cared about my status as the Cooke family's adopted daughter. I had held my head high, throwing my weight around as if I were their true heir. But the kidnapping taught me the truth—the Cooke family owned my life. If they refused to pay the ransom, I would die.

Roderick frowned, a flicker of displeasure crossing his face. ""How did you end up like this?""

Like this? What was ""this""? A madwoman? A beggar? I had trekked dozens of kilometers, terrified to close my eyes for a second. Beyond the kidnappers, I had to guard against wild animals in the suburban forests. I drank rainwater and scavenged from highway trash piles. Anyone in my position would go crazy.

I understood his displeasure. My appearance before the media was an embarrassment, likely bringing trouble to his company—the Cooke family's company, to be exact.

""I'm sorry,"" I said. I apologized for offending his sight.

Roderick paused, then a faint smile touched his lips. ""She was right. You've learned to behave.""

I didn't know what he meant. The car door closed, and we began to move. Suddenly, he reached out toward me. I instinctively shrank back into the corner. He stopped, his expression twisting with disdain. ""Camille, you stink.""

Perhaps in the enclosed space, the full force of my odor finally reached him—the pungent mix of blood, sweat, and the fetid decay of mud and garbage.

At his words, I shifted further away. But the car hit a bump, and I slid onto the floor.

""I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. I won't dirty the seats. I'll just..."" I'd just stay down here.

Chapter 2

It hurts so much. There were still bloody holes in my knees where the kidnappers stabbed me. They blamed me, saying I meant nothing at all to Roderick. Since no ransom came, they had wasted their time, so they took their anger out on me.

I couldn't stand, so I simply maintained such a position in that small space.

Roderick flew into a rage instantly. He ordered me, ""What the hell are you doing? Get back to your seat!""

His face showed repulsion, and he didn't move an inch to help me up. I had no choice but to obey, straining to prop myself up and sit back down. The pain, combined with days of low blood sugar, forced tears from my eyes.

Roderick had always ignored my tears, only looking annoyed. But this time, for the first time, he tossed the handkerchief he'd wiped his hands with at me.

I clutched the clean, white cloth tightly. Once, this would have made me ecstatic, but now, the handkerchief only highlighted how filthy and tattered I was.

Timothy glanced at me in the rearview mirror. I bowed my head. He'd probably never seen me so humiliatingly ridiculous.

When the car pulled back to the Cooke's villa, Roderick ordered me taken to the bathroom to clean up. I refused the servants' help, only asking them to fetch a floor-length dress from my old wardrobe.

They rummaged around, finally pulling out a prim long-sleeved dress, like a school uniform, from among the trendy clothes.

No one defines how students should dress, but staring at myself in the mirror, I did look more like a student than in my previous styles.

I remembered that before the kidnapping, I'd gotten an offer from a top foreign design school. But now, three months had passed since the enrollment deadline.

""Thank you.""

The servants looked startled, not expecting gratitude from me.

But after all this, I knew clearly that deep down, I was no different from them. They were servants hired by the Cooke family, while I was a daughter hired by the Cooke family.

When I pushed open the door and stepped out, I saw Roderick standing at the top of the stairs, waiting for me. He leaned half against the railing, lazily sizing me up, then sneered.

""Camille, what game are you playing? Dressed like this.""

Did he think it was tacky? Roderick probably took it for another childish trick to get his attention, but I just wanted to cover the scars on my body.

I followed him to the dining room. It was so quiet. Not until Roderick nodded for me to step forward did I see my adopted parents, Kaleb and Talia Cooke, at the table, their faces tight with worry.

The second Talia saw me, she stood up, nearly rushing over. Her steps faltered, and a woman beside her quickly steadied her.

""Madam Cooke, don't fret. Isn't Ms. Cantrell back safe and sound?"" The woman then turned to me. ""Ms. Cantrell, Madam Cooke has been terribly worried about you. Her hair even turned grey overnight.""

I knew her. She was Roderick's secretary, Carissa Barron.

Her hair fell in natural black waves, and she wore a plain turtleneck and jeans. But around her neck hung a delicate rose gold necklace.

""Safe and sound""? She said it like a contrast to Talia's graying hair. With just one sentence, I was no longer a victim but the Cooke family's ungrateful member.

Talia pulled me into a sobbing hug, and Carissa patted her back to comfort her. But I couldn't cry. I looked at Roderick, and his eyes seemed to say, ""You're so ungrateful.""

Finally, Kaleb cut in, his voice sharp with authority. ""Stop clinging to Camille. Let her sit and eat.""

Talia wiped her tears, forcing a smile. ""It's my fault. Millie, you've been through so much. You must have starved. Here, I made your favorite apple pie!""

Talia tugged me to a seat between her and Kaleb. Roderick sat across from me, and Carissa settled right beside him.

How perfectly family they all looked.

Chapter 3

I stared at the food on my plate. It looked so aromatic and appetizing. I'd almost forgotten what normal food tasted like. For a second, I wanted to hurl the fork aside, grab the food with my hands, and stuff it into my mouth.

The closer we'd gotten to the city highway, the stricter the sanitation management had been. Gradually, I couldn't find any dumps, which meant no food. I'd gone nearly three days hungry, reduced to eating leaves to survive.

Under everyone's gaze, I forced myself to stay composed, picking up the fork to send food into my mouth. Even so, I caught Carissa's mocking glance. She ate in tiny, dainty bites, flaunting her poise.

Roderick, seeing this, clearly grew more repelled. But at Talia's nudge, he reluctantly placed a piece of BBQ ribs on my plate with his own hand.

I'd thought I could choke down even the blandest food, but I just stared at those tempting BBQ ribs. Knowing Roderick had put them there, I felt my stomach churn with revulsion.

""Millie, try it,"" Talia urged. ""Roderick knew you liked BBQ flavor, so he asked the chef to make this extra dish just for you.""

Bullshit. Roderick had no idea what I liked. If anything, I knew his preferences well. For instance, among all types of gold, rose gold was his favorite.

Seeing me hesitate, Kaleb asked gently, ""What's wrong, Millie? Did you and Roderick argue on the way back? Don't worry, I'll teach him a lesson after dinner.""

""Dad!"" Roderick snapped, likely humiliated in front of Carissa.

I shook my head, said nothing, and forced down the physical disgust, spearing the ribs with my fork and putting them in my mouth.

But the second I swallowed, I retched, vomiting it all up.

Roderick looked stunned. I shot up from my chair, clutching my head, and cowered in the corner.

""I'm sorry. I'll eat it! Don't hit me!""

Everyone froze. Talia's tears spilled again as she rushed over to hug me. ""Did they hurt you, Millie? Tell me. Did they abuse you?""

Kaleb and Roderick came over, too. Kaleb's face softened with care, looking at me with pity.

Roderick frowned, silent, his expression unreasonably dark.

What was this about? Hadn't the kidnappers threatened the Cooke family, saying that if they didn't pay the ransom, their adopted daughter would suffer?

Why were they asking me now if I'd been abused?

Actually, back then, even a rotten sandwich or a spoiled bottle of milk never struck me as abuse. After all, what I got to eat afterward was nothing but slop.

I was just so scared of feeling like my life hung in Roderick's hands.

The kidnappers had negotiated with him personally, but he'd chosen to give up on me. He hated me so much.

I think that was where my physical nausea came from.

After dinner, I was called to Kaleb's study.

Kaleb set aside his usual sharp, business-like demeanor, asking me gently and patiently, ""Millie, you've loved Roderick since you were little. Do you still like him now?""

I shook my head wildly, so violently that the muscles in my cheeks felt a sharp ache.

I'd loved Roderick for seven years, and it meant I've spent seven years living humbly and suffering. But I'd never learned my lesson. This time, I'd endured hellish torment, and that was the revenge for me.

I couldn't dare to like Roderick anymore.

Kaleb heard my answer and paused thoughtfully before sighing regretfully, ""Well, fine. You might not be my daughter-in-law, but you'll always be our daughter. Millie, you're such a perfect, beautiful girl. It's just that Roderick doesn't deserve you.""

He pulled a bank card from his desk drawer. ""Your parents left this for you. It has 600 thousand dollars in it. They told me to keep it secure and give it to you as a dowry once you were older.""

600 thousand dollars. It was the same as the ransom sum.

During those days of being kidnapped, I'd even resented my parents, blaming them for not taking me with them, leaving me to endure this torture. I hadn't done anything wrong.

It turned out they'd left me enough to live comfortably as well. Their love for me had been deeper than I knew.

I bit my thumb to hold back my tears.

""Thank you, Kaleb.""

It was already eight o'clock when I left the study. I headed for my room, only to run into Roderick halfway.

He seemed to guess where I was going, and his tone was surprisingly soft when he said, ""Carissa will stay in your room tonight. You'll take the guest room next to mine.""

I could see that all he cared about was Carissa.

I nodded and turned to walk the other way. When I settled into the Cooke's villa, Roderick's hatred for me was so strong that he relocated his room to the farthest spot from mine: his at the east end, mine at the west.

But my room had been decorated by a top designer at the Cooke family's request, far nicer than most.

Yet it was still the Cooke family's property. If Roderick told me to give it up, I had no choice but to obey.

I'd taken a few steps when Roderick called after me. ""Camille, why are you suddenly so obedient?""

Chapter 4

I turned around and saw that his face held both sarcasm and a faint flicker of worry.

""I'm sorry,"" I mumbled, hesitating. Beyond apologies, I had no idea what else to say to Roderick.

""That's the third time you've apologized to me today. You're acting weird."" Roderick stepped closer, leaning in as if to touch my forehead.

I flinched away as fast as if shocked by electricity. By the time I clung to the corridor railing to steady myself, my legs were so weak I could barely stand.

Roderick stared at me like I was insane, his patience fraying into annoyance.

I forced down the tremor in my voice. ""I ... I'll move out tomorrow. I already told Kaleb.""

I'd thought Roderick would be relieved to hear it, so that he'd let me go. Instead, his face darkened with anger.

""Move out? Why? I only asked you to let Carissa stay in your room temporarily. She's a guest here. Can't you just make that tiny concession? It won't cost you much.""

I shook my head quickly. ""No, that's not it.""

Roderick's jaw tightened. He grabbed my wrist roughly and dragged me toward the easternmost room.

""Come with me. I need to talk to you.""

Fear flooded my mind. Through tears, I fumbled for the bank card Kaleb had just given me, holding it out. ""I'm sorry. I have money now. Don't hit me.

""I can pay you. Please don't hit me.""

Roderick froze, turning around in shock. I'd crumpled to the floor, but he was still gripping my wrist in a tight clamp.

""Camille, what are you talking about?""

By then, I'd bitten my lips so hard that they'd turned purple. As Roderick's face drew closer, the kidnappers' taunts flooded back. ""You're just the Cooke family's pet, still clinging to your owner.""

""Rody, no. Mr. Cooke, I won't pester you anymore. I'll never dare again.""

Roderick finally sensed something was off with my state of mind. His movements softened. He slipped an arm around my waist and lifted me from the floor.

The sudden weightlessness made me cling to his neck instinctively. At that, the tightness in his expression finally eased a little.

""Camille, it's not that I don't want you to pester me, but...""

He didn't finish. The corridor door clicked open, and Carissa poked her head out of my room, the lights behind her bright.

She covered her mouth, feigning surprise. ""Mr. Cooke, Ms. Cantrell.""

Roderick's mood soured. ""You have the room. What else do you need?""

Carissa's voice turned wronged. ""The Australian branch is having a video conference. They need you to attend in person, Mr. Cooke.""

Roderick glanced at me in his arms, then let go. My body went rigid, and words were stuck in my throat.

""Wait for me in my room.""

After Roderick said that, he walked toward Carissa. The two stepped into the room, and the door clicked shut behind them.

The bright light vanished from the corridor, leaving me with a shaky sense of relief, like I'd narrowly escaped danger. Cold sweat had soaked through the back of my clothes.

Roderick wouldn't come back. I knew Carissa's tricks too well. She'd pulled him away like this so many times: on my birthday, at my graduation. Perhaps he'd intended all along to stay away from me and never return.

And I had to leave as soon as I could. I needed to go somewhere I'd never see Roderick again. I was so scared that if I had to face him even once more, I'd lose my mind.

Chapter 5

I sat on the guest room bed until 3 a.m. Roderick's bedroom, the one next to mine, stayed completely quiet the whole time.

In between, I used the phone Talia had given me to log into a rental app. I found an apartment with good security that was available immediately.

As soon as dawn broke, the Cooke's villa still silent, I grabbed my leather shoes and snuck out barefoot.

Stepping outside, I froze. I saw someone leaning against Roderick's car, playing with his phone. My heart jumped in my chest. I was so afraid it was Roderick.

The person heard me and looked up. It was Timothy.

I pretended nothing was wrong, walking past him toward the roadside to hail a taxi. But he followed.

""Ms. Cantrell?""

I didn't answer.

""Does Mr. Cooke know you're...""

""Can you not tell Roderick?"" I cut in.

I held back my excitement, forcing myself to stay calm. I was so close to escaping. Why did I have to run into Timothy?

Timothy looked confused. ""Mr. Cooke will be worried.""

I shook my head frantically, then started pulling off my coat.

Timothy stepped back in a hurry, turning his head away, his ears turning red. ""Ms. Cantrell, what are you doing?""

If it meant I could get away, shame didn't matter anymore. My dignity had been worn away by Roderick long ago.

""He doesn't worry about me. He's the one who told those kidnappers to leave these scars on me.""

Timothy looked over. Under my coat was a white sleeveless top. He could clearly see the purple whip marks, blue bruises, and scabbed cuts covering my arms.

He looked stunned. Those shocking injuries were beyond anything he'd imagined.

While he froze, I hurried to pull my coat back on, begging, ""Timothy, please let me go. If you don't, I'll die.""

It was the first time I'd called him by his name. Before, I'd only referred to him as ""Roderick's pet"", just like the kidnappers had called me ""the Cooke family's pet.""

Timothy stood silent for a long time. I seized the chance to run toward the roadside to hail a taxi. Suddenly, a large hand grabbed my arm, but the instant he sensed the scars under my clothes, he jolted backward, letting me free immediately.

I almost burst into tears. ""Don't stop me...""

Timothy clenched his jaw and said in a firm tone, ""You can't get a taxi at midnight. I'll drive you.""

I was dumbfounded.

With a jumble of fear and hope, I got into Roderick's car again. Timothy carefully reached over and turned off the driving recorder first.

""Just make do with it. It won't take long.""

He assumed I was resisting taking Roderick's car, and truth be told, he was right. But if it let me break free from Roderick and the Cooke family, I didn't care about it at all.

Chapter 6

The car arrived at the community that the agent and I had settled on. I'd sent a text to the agent, telling them I wanted to move in immediately. Eager for the commission, the agent brought the contract and keys early, greeting us with a smile at the community entrance.

Timothy still looked worried. He followed me upstairs to see the apartment. It was a fully furnished duplex. It wasn't huge, but it had all the basic daily necessities I'd need.

""It's 120 square meters. This community's largest unit,"" the agent gushed. ""Ms. Cantrell, whether you live here alone or with your boyfriend, it's more than spacious enough.""

I glanced at Timothy. He stayed quiet, his head down as he flipped through the contract. Then he asked the agent for details on utilities, water, electricity, and air conditioning, and only handed me the contract once he'd confirmed everything was okay.

Somehow, I trusted him. Maybe it was because he'd never complained about my flailing punches and kicks when he pulled me out of Roderick's office. Or maybe it was because, when Roderick sent him to fetch me from bars, he'd chased off the men who tried to take advantage of me.

I didn't hesitate, signing the contract quickly. I pulled out my bank card and handed it to the agent. He swiped it on the POS machine, tossed a few flattering remarks at Timothy and me, then left happily.

The empty room now held only Timothy and me. He suddenly seemed ill at ease.

""Ms. Cantrell, I need to head back,"" he said.

I nodded, reaching automatically for a check to thank him. That was my habit. But then I froze, realizing I had no money on me.

I'd snuck out with nothing. I'd wanted to grab a few clothes, but my room was already taken by Carissa, let alone a checkbook.

""Timothy, how can I thank you?"" I asked.

Timothy looked a little surprised. ""You don't need to. It's my pleasure.""

I said nothing more. But if he ever needed something from me later, I'd never say no.

Timothy left. He had to get back to work. Before he went, he said, ""Get some good rest.""

I certainly wanted to rest. More than that, I felt like I could finally rest.

Over those dozens of kilometers on the run, I'd slept under farmland canopies and on low tree trunks. Calling it ""sleep"" was a stretch. I'd stayed tense the whole time, wary of anyone coming to catch me, of wild animals that might hurt me.

Back at the Cooke's villa, I'd been waiting for a chance to escape. Even when I sat on the soft guest room bed, I'd pinched the tender flesh on my inner thighs over and over just to stay awake.

I took off my shoes and went up to the bedroom. There was only a bare mattress on the large bed. I hadn't had time to buy any bedding.

Luckily, the duplex came with blackout curtains. I pulled them shut, collapsed onto the mattress, and fell into a deep sleep.

When I finally came to, I heard loud banging on the door. It was so loud it echoed through the apartment and the whole hallway.

But I'd slept too deeply. I sat up in the bed, frozen. I could barely move. It was as though my arms and legs had forgotten how to function.

Then I heard the lock cylinder hit the floor with a sharp click. That jolted me awake.

Who was it?

Chapter 7

Was it a kidnapper? Or Roderick? I scrambled to find something in the room to defend myself, but there was nothing.

I got up and hurried downstairs. Panic made me clumsy. I slipped and fell when there were only one or two steps left.

""Camille!""

A clear voice cut through the chaos. I looked up to see Timothy standing outside my door, with a shopping bag in hand, breathless and frantic.

He rushed over to help me up. ""Are you okay?""

I froze, confused, wondering what was happening.

Outside, a locksmith was replacing the door's lock core, then packing his tools into a tool bag.

""Oh, young lady,"" the locksmith said, ""your boyfriend's been knocking for two hours and you didn't answer. He was so worried about you.""

I held my head, still groggy. In that deep sleep, I really hadn't heard a thing.

The locksmith went on. ""He said you've got depression? He was so afraid you'd hurt yourself. Listen to me, girl, you're so young and beautiful. The future is yourself. Take it easy.""

I glanced at Timothy. Embarrassed, he let go of me and stepped toward the locksmith. ""Sir, that's enough. I'm not her boyfriend. How much for the new lock?""

After taking the money, the locksmith gave us a knowing look, slinging his tool bag over his shoulder. ""Young lady, he's a good guy. Why don't you give him a chance?""

Timothy slammed the door shut, avoiding my eyes.

He mumbled, ""Sorry, I was scared you might be ... in trouble. So I called the locksmith. I didn't tell him anything, I promise.""

I knew Timothy was straightforward. His emotions showed plainly on his face. He must have been truly panicked earlier, which was why the locksmith got the wrong idea.

""It's fine. I was just asleep."" Truth was, Timothy didn't need to worry about me like that. If I didn't cherish my life so fiercely, I never would have climbed back from that hell.

I licked my cracked lips. Timothy noticed, reaching into the shopping bag he'd dumped on the floor and pulling out a bottle of milk. He unscrewed the cap and handed it to me.

I took it, sipping slowly. It was ice-cold, like it had just come out of the freezer. He even remembered that I only liked drinking milk chilled.

Timothy glanced around the apartment before his eyes finally landed on me. I was still in that long dress, which was crumpled and a little messy now.

""How long have you been asleep?"" he asked, confused.

I thought for a second. ""Over two hours?""

Hadn't he said he'd been knocking for two hours?

Timothy's expression turned odd. ""Think again. It's been two days since you signed the contract.""

""Two days?""

I froze. Timothy was in casual clothes now, but I clearly remembered he'd been wearing a suit early in the morning.

Then I realized I'd slept for two whole days and nights without eating or drinking a thing.

Timothy then knew everything. He reached out and brushed the table. Sure enough, his finger came away dusty. I hadn't cleaned the apartment once since moving in.

He took off his black jacket, tossing it over a chair. A cloud of dust puffed up when the fabric hit the seat.

""Sit here, on my jacket,"" he said.

I didn't know what he was planning, but I walked over and did as he said.

He rolled up his sleeves and headed for the bathroom. After a clatter of water, Timothy came out with a wet rag, starting to wipe the dining table first, then moving to the coffee table and wardrobe.

""Just rest. Once I'm done cleaning, I'll take you to eat.""

Take me to eat? That thought seemed weird, especially paired with the sight of him cleaning my apartment. Timothy was Roderick's bodyguard, a man who spoke with his fists, yet he handled housework so carefully.

About an hour later, after mopping the floor, Timothy went back to the bathroom to splash some water on his face, then wrapped up his chores.

""Getting hungry?"" he asked.

Water droplets dripped from the tips of his wet hair. His sharp, rugged features softened into a lazy, natural grin.

I nodded in a daze, then shook my head again.

He laughed loudly. He stepped over, and it looked like he was about to reach up and touch my head. But then he paused, remembering something, and pulled his hand back.

""Let's go.""

Chapter 8

I stood up, and he picked up the jacket.

""How about French cuisine? It won't be spicy. I heard those girls talking about how delicious it is.""

Those ""girls"" must have been employees at Roderick's company. Timothy dealt with them sometimes. Had he gone so far as to ask them about restaurants, all because of me?

His words stirred a faint hunger in me. I'd slept for two full days, after all. And that night at the Cooke's villa, I'd barely eaten before vomiting it all up.

But I'd only taken two steps when a sharp cramp twisted my stomach. I stumbled to the bathroom, clutching the toilet to retch. There was nothing left in my stomach. So only bitter, brownish blood came up.

Timothy, who'd followed me in, grabbed my shoulders. I was so thin, and I felt like I was curling up in midair against him.

""Camille?""

He helped me to the sink and got some water for me to rinse my mouth.

""Did you go to the hospital for a checkup after you got back?"" he asked, his voice tight with seriousness.

I shook my head.

He lifted me up without hesitation, grabbing the keys before heading downstairs. The pain was so bad that I couldn't speak. In the taxi, he used the little first-aid know-how he had, pinching the webbing between my thumb and index finger to ease the stomachache.

""Sir, please, faster,"" Timothy urged. The driver glanced at me in the rearview mirror and silently pressed down harder on the gas.

I drifted in and out of consciousness through the whole exam. By the time the gastric lavage was over, Timothy walked into my ward with the report.

He sat on the edge of my bed, frown deep as he scanned the medical records. He was too tall for the hospital stool, so his long legs splayed, knees pushed up.

""Do you want to be hospitalized?"" he asked.

""What did the doctor say?""

""The doctor said it's not necessary, but...""

""Then I don't want to."" I hated places with constant comings and goings. I wouldn't feel safe.

Timothy was quiet for a moment. ""All right. But you'll have to come to the hospital every day for dressing changes and checkups.""

I could already feel that some of my wounds had been treated and bandaged.

""For now, you can only have liquid foods every day.""

I didn't need him to tell me why. I knew eating spoiled food and slop for three months had ruined my stomach.

""Timothy.""

""Yes?""

""But I'm so hungry right now...""

Timothy's eyes softened with obvious pity. He'd learned from the doctor that the food I ate wasn't digested at all. It just sat in my stomach, and I couldn't vomit it out, so a lavage became needed.

He laid a gentle hand on my forehead, as if to soothe me, and promised, ""I'll make your food taste good. Trust me, okay?""

Timothy kept his word. He was surprisingly skilled in the kitchen, turning the plainest cereal into something palatable with little tweaks.

Thanks to him, I felt my strength returning day by day.

Today, as I reached for a third share of cereal with milk at lunch, Timothy stopped me.

He grinned, his eyes crinkling. ""Sneaking one more share while I was juicing, little glutton?""

Foiled, I huffed and set the tableware in the sink. He put down the half-chopped fruit and stepped over. ""I'll wash up. Just go watch TV on the sofa.""

I nodded, upset. He suddenly caught my arm and pulled me back. I found myself pinned between the counter and his body.

""Mad at me for stopping the cereal? You won't talk to me?""

I stayed silent, my lips pursed. I just looked away.

He laughed, ""The doctor said starting tomorrow, you can have a proper meal. I'll take you for French cuisine.""

My eyes lit up. ""Really?""

""For sure.""

Timothy's expression softened with fondness. He let me go, patted my back gently, and nudged me toward the sofa before returning to the kitchen to finish his work.

I sat down and pulled out the bank card my parents had left me. Beyond the money inside, it held their last thoughts for me.

For a moment, I felt like the luckiest kid. Their love had never left me. Before their accident, they'd been planning for my future.

And Timothy felt like a gift they'd sent me.

I tucked the card away carefully. If it was meant to be my dowry, I'd keep it safe.

The TV was playing the news. After a snippet of music, a glaring headline flashed across the screen.

""The Cooke Family's Adopted Daughter Found Wandering Barefoot After Kidnapping. Ex-Noble Lady Now Disheveled, Acting Erratically.""

I switched off the TV instantly, my breath coming fast. I told myself over and over again that it was all over. I'd never see those people or Roderick again.

It took a long time for me to finally calm down. Then the doorbell rang.

I figured it was another delivery Timothy had ordered. He'd been the one designing and furnishing this apartment since I moved in, after all.

I didn't think twice, getting up to open the door. But standing outside was someone I never wanted to see again.",1,1763607309.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1

I was in love with Roderick Cooke for seven years. When I was kidnapped, he didn't pay the ransom, all because his female secretary suggested using the opportunity to teach me a lesson—to make me behave.

I endured hellish torture and finally learned to stay away from Roderick. Yet, he cried and begged me for another chance.

\*\*\*

The day I walked barefoot back into the city, I made the news.

Camille Cantrell—the Cooke family's adopted daughter, kidnapped for months—had finally escaped. Dressed in rags, her feet lacerated and filthy, she had stumbled back to civilization.

Reporters swarmed, their camera flashes exploding around me. Facing the blinding glare, I felt nothing. I was already dead inside.

The Camille Cantrell of the past was gone. That bright, dazzling, willful, and vivacious girl had been destroyed—by the kidnappers, and by Roderick.

Soon, a group of black-clad bodyguards carved a path through the crowd. Their leader was Timothy Glisson. I knew him. During my seven years of pestering Roderick, it was always Timothy who had ""seen me off"" from Roderick's office and apartment.

""Seen me off"" was a polite term. More often, it involved dragging me out, a consequence of my persistence and Roderick's extreme repulsion toward me.

""Ms. Cantrell, Mr. Cooke is waiting for you in the car. This way.""

Timothy's gaze faltered as it landed on me. Clearly, I was far more wretched than he had anticipated.

I nodded and stepped forward on my injured feet. A trail of bloody footprints marked my path. The pain had long since numbed, and this short distance was nothing compared to my flight for survival.

Following behind me, Timothy couldn't help but call out, ""Ms. Cantrell...""

I didn't respond. Did he pity me? He should be relieved, in fact. After this ""lesson"", I would never pester Roderick again. And of course, I would no longer cause his job extra trouble.

When I stepped into the car, I saw Roderick in the back seat, eyes closed, resting. His dark hair was impeccably styled, his features exquisitely chiseled.

I imagined my absence had brought him unprecedented peace. Of course, he was in excellent condition.

Hearing the disturbance, Roderick slowly opened his eyes. For a moment, he didn't recognize me. ""Camille?""

I nodded obediently. Yes, I had learned to behave. Before, I had never cared about my status as the Cooke family's adopted daughter. I had held my head high, throwing my weight around as if I were their true heir. But the kidnapping taught me the truth—the Cooke family owned my life. If they refused to pay the ransom, I would die.

Roderick frowned, a flicker of displeasure crossing his face. ""How did you end up like this?""

Like this? What was ""this""? A madwoman? A beggar? I had trekked dozens of kilometers, terrified to close my eyes for a second. Beyond the kidnappers, I had to guard against wild animals in the suburban forests. I drank rainwater and scavenged from highway trash piles. Anyone in my position would go crazy.

I understood his displeasure. My appearance before the media was an embarrassment, likely bringing trouble to his company—the Cooke family's company, to be exact.

""I'm sorry,"" I said. I apologized for offending his sight.

Roderick paused, then a faint smile touched his lips. ""She was right. You've learned to behave.""

I didn't know what he meant. The car door closed, and we began to move. Suddenly, he reached out toward me. I instinctively shrank back into the corner. He stopped, his expression twisting with disdain. ""Camille, you stink.""

Perhaps in the enclosed space, the full force of my odor finally reached him—the pungent mix of blood, sweat, and the fetid decay of mud and garbage.

At his words, I shifted further away. But the car hit a bump, and I slid onto the floor.

""I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. I won't dirty the seats. I'll just..."" I'd just stay down here.

Chapter 2

It hurts so much. There were still bloody holes in my knees where the kidnappers stabbed me. They blamed me, saying I meant nothing at all to Roderick. Since no ransom came, they had wasted their time, so they took their anger out on me.

I couldn't stand, so I simply maintained such a position in that small space.

Roderick flew into a rage instantly. He ordered me, ""What the hell are you doing? Get back to your seat!""

His face showed repulsion, and he didn't move an inch to help me up. I had no choice but to obey, straining to prop myself up and sit back down. The pain, combined with days of low blood sugar, forced tears from my eyes.

Roderick had always ignored my tears, only looking annoyed. But this time, for the first time, he tossed the handkerchief he'd wiped his hands with at me.

I clutched the clean, white cloth tightly. Once, this would have made me ecstatic, but now, the handkerchief only highlighted how filthy and tattered I was.

Timothy glanced at me in the rearview mirror. I bowed my head. He'd probably never seen me so humiliatingly ridiculous.

When the car pulled back to the Cooke's villa, Roderick ordered me taken to the bathroom to clean up. I refused the servants' help, only asking them to fetch a floor-length dress from my old wardrobe.

They rummaged around, finally pulling out a prim long-sleeved dress, like a school uniform, from among the trendy clothes.

No one defines how students should dress, but staring at myself in the mirror, I did look more like a student than in my previous styles.

I remembered that before the kidnapping, I'd gotten an offer from a top foreign design school. But now, three months had passed since the enrollment deadline.

""Thank you.""

The servants looked startled, not expecting gratitude from me.

But after all this, I knew clearly that deep down, I was no different from them. They were servants hired by the Cooke family, while I was a daughter hired by the Cooke family.

When I pushed open the door and stepped out, I saw Roderick standing at the top of the stairs, waiting for me. He leaned half against the railing, lazily sizing me up, then sneered.

""Camille, what game are you playing? Dressed like this.""

Did he think it was tacky? Roderick probably took it for another childish trick to get his attention, but I just wanted to cover the scars on my body.

I followed him to the dining room. It was so quiet. Not until Roderick nodded for me to step forward did I see my adopted parents, Kaleb and Talia Cooke, at the table, their faces tight with worry.

The second Talia saw me, she stood up, nearly rushing over. Her steps faltered, and a woman beside her quickly steadied her.

""Madam Cooke, don't fret. Isn't Ms. Cantrell back safe and sound?"" The woman then turned to me. ""Ms. Cantrell, Madam Cooke has been terribly worried about you. Her hair even turned grey overnight.""

I knew her. She was Roderick's secretary, Carissa Barron.

Her hair fell in natural black waves, and she wore a plain turtleneck and jeans. But around her neck hung a delicate rose gold necklace.

""Safe and sound""? She said it like a contrast to Talia's graying hair. With just one sentence, I was no longer a victim but the Cooke family's ungrateful member.

Talia pulled me into a sobbing hug, and Carissa patted her back to comfort her. But I couldn't cry. I looked at Roderick, and his eyes seemed to say, ""You're so ungrateful.""

Finally, Kaleb cut in, his voice sharp with authority. ""Stop clinging to Camille. Let her sit and eat.""

Talia wiped her tears, forcing a smile. ""It's my fault. Millie, you've been through so much. You must have starved. Here, I made your favorite apple pie!""

Talia tugged me to a seat between her and Kaleb. Roderick sat across from me, and Carissa settled right beside him.

How perfectly family they all looked.

Chapter 3

I stared at the food on my plate. It looked so aromatic and appetizing. I'd almost forgotten what normal food tasted like. For a second, I wanted to hurl the fork aside, grab the food with my hands, and stuff it into my mouth.

The closer we'd gotten to the city highway, the stricter the sanitation management had been. Gradually, I couldn't find any dumps, which meant no food. I'd gone nearly three days hungry, reduced to eating leaves to survive.

Under everyone's gaze, I forced myself to stay composed, picking up the fork to send food into my mouth. Even so, I caught Carissa's mocking glance. She ate in tiny, dainty bites, flaunting her poise.

Roderick, seeing this, clearly grew more repelled. But at Talia's nudge, he reluctantly placed a piece of BBQ ribs on my plate with his own hand.

I'd thought I could choke down even the blandest food, but I just stared at those tempting BBQ ribs. Knowing Roderick had put them there, I felt my stomach churn with revulsion.

""Millie, try it,"" Talia urged. ""Roderick knew you liked BBQ flavor, so he asked the chef to make this extra dish just for you.""

Bullshit. Roderick had no idea what I liked. If anything, I knew his preferences well. For instance, among all types of gold, rose gold was his favorite.

Seeing me hesitate, Kaleb asked gently, ""What's wrong, Millie? Did you and Roderick argue on the way back? Don't worry, I'll teach him a lesson after dinner.""

""Dad!"" Roderick snapped, likely humiliated in front of Carissa.

I shook my head, said nothing, and forced down the physical disgust, spearing the ribs with my fork and putting them in my mouth.

But the second I swallowed, I retched, vomiting it all up.

Roderick looked stunned. I shot up from my chair, clutching my head, and cowered in the corner.

""I'm sorry. I'll eat it! Don't hit me!""

Everyone froze. Talia's tears spilled again as she rushed over to hug me. ""Did they hurt you, Millie? Tell me. Did they abuse you?""

Kaleb and Roderick came over, too. Kaleb's face softened with care, looking at me with pity.

Roderick frowned, silent, his expression unreasonably dark.

What was this about? Hadn't the kidnappers threatened the Cooke family, saying that if they didn't pay the ransom, their adopted daughter would suffer?

Why were they asking me now if I'd been abused?

Actually, back then, even a rotten sandwich or a spoiled bottle of milk never struck me as abuse. After all, what I got to eat afterward was nothing but slop.

I was just so scared of feeling like my life hung in Roderick's hands.

The kidnappers had negotiated with him personally, but he'd chosen to give up on me. He hated me so much.

I think that was where my physical nausea came from.

After dinner, I was called to Kaleb's study.

Kaleb set aside his usual sharp, business-like demeanor, asking me gently and patiently, ""Millie, you've loved Roderick since you were little. Do you still like him now?""

I shook my head wildly, so violently that the muscles in my cheeks felt a sharp ache.

I'd loved Roderick for seven years, and it meant I've spent seven years living humbly and suffering. But I'd never learned my lesson. This time, I'd endured hellish torment, and that was the revenge for me.

I couldn't dare to like Roderick anymore.

Kaleb heard my answer and paused thoughtfully before sighing regretfully, ""Well, fine. You might not be my daughter-in-law, but you'll always be our daughter. Millie, you're such a perfect, beautiful girl. It's just that Roderick doesn't deserve you.""

He pulled a bank card from his desk drawer. ""Your parents left this for you. It has 600 thousand dollars in it. They told me to keep it secure and give it to you as a dowry once you were older.""

600 thousand dollars. It was the same as the ransom sum.

During those days of being kidnapped, I'd even resented my parents, blaming them for not taking me with them, leaving me to endure this torture. I hadn't done anything wrong.

It turned out they'd left me enough to live comfortably as well. Their love for me had been deeper than I knew.

I bit my thumb to hold back my tears.

""Thank you, Kaleb.""

It was already eight o'clock when I left the study. I headed for my room, only to run into Roderick halfway.

He seemed to guess where I was going, and his tone was surprisingly soft when he said, ""Carissa will stay in your room tonight. You'll take the guest room next to mine.""

I could see that all he cared about was Carissa.

I nodded and turned to walk the other way. When I settled into the Cooke's villa, Roderick's hatred for me was so strong that he relocated his room to the farthest spot from mine: his at the east end, mine at the west.

But my room had been decorated by a top designer at the Cooke family's request, far nicer than most.

Yet it was still the Cooke family's property. If Roderick told me to give it up, I had no choice but to obey.

I'd taken a few steps when Roderick called after me. ""Camille, why are you suddenly so obedient?""

Chapter 4

I turned around and saw that his face held both sarcasm and a faint flicker of worry.

""I'm sorry,"" I mumbled, hesitating. Beyond apologies, I had no idea what else to say to Roderick.

""That's the third time you've apologized to me today. You're acting weird."" Roderick stepped closer, leaning in as if to touch my forehead.

I flinched away as fast as if shocked by electricity. By the time I clung to the corridor railing to steady myself, my legs were so weak I could barely stand.

Roderick stared at me like I was insane, his patience fraying into annoyance.

I forced down the tremor in my voice. ""I ... I'll move out tomorrow. I already told Kaleb.""

I'd thought Roderick would be relieved to hear it, so that he'd let me go. Instead, his face darkened with anger.

""Move out? Why? I only asked you to let Carissa stay in your room temporarily. She's a guest here. Can't you just make that tiny concession? It won't cost you much.""

I shook my head quickly. ""No, that's not it.""

Roderick's jaw tightened. He grabbed my wrist roughly and dragged me toward the easternmost room.

""Come with me. I need to talk to you.""

Fear flooded my mind. Through tears, I fumbled for the bank card Kaleb had just given me, holding it out. ""I'm sorry. I have money now. Don't hit me.

""I can pay you. Please don't hit me.""

Roderick froze, turning around in shock. I'd crumpled to the floor, but he was still gripping my wrist in a tight clamp.

""Camille, what are you talking about?""

By then, I'd bitten my lips so hard that they'd turned purple. As Roderick's face drew closer, the kidnappers' taunts flooded back. ""You're just the Cooke family's pet, still clinging to your owner.""

""Rody, no. Mr. Cooke, I won't pester you anymore. I'll never dare again.""

Roderick finally sensed something was off with my state of mind. His movements softened. He slipped an arm around my waist and lifted me from the floor.

The sudden weightlessness made me cling to his neck instinctively. At that, the tightness in his expression finally eased a little.

""Camille, it's not that I don't want you to pester me, but...""

He didn't finish. The corridor door clicked open, and Carissa poked her head out of my room, the lights behind her bright.

She covered her mouth, feigning surprise. ""Mr. Cooke, Ms. Cantrell.""

Roderick's mood soured. ""You have the room. What else do you need?""

Carissa's voice turned wronged. ""The Australian branch is having a video conference. They need you to attend in person, Mr. Cooke.""

Roderick glanced at me in his arms, then let go. My body went rigid, and words were stuck in my throat.

""Wait for me in my room.""

After Roderick said that, he walked toward Carissa. The two stepped into the room, and the door clicked shut behind them.

The bright light vanished from the corridor, leaving me with a shaky sense of relief, like I'd narrowly escaped danger. Cold sweat had soaked through the back of my clothes.

Roderick wouldn't come back. I knew Carissa's tricks too well. She'd pulled him away like this so many times: on my birthday, at my graduation. Perhaps he'd intended all along to stay away from me and never return.

And I had to leave as soon as I could. I needed to go somewhere I'd never see Roderick again. I was so scared that if I had to face him even once more, I'd lose my mind.

Chapter 5

I sat on the guest room bed until 3 a.m. Roderick's bedroom, the one next to mine, stayed completely quiet the whole time.

In between, I used the phone Talia had given me to log into a rental app. I found an apartment with good security that was available immediately.

As soon as dawn broke, the Cooke's villa still silent, I grabbed my leather shoes and snuck out barefoot.

Stepping outside, I froze. I saw someone leaning against Roderick's car, playing with his phone. My heart jumped in my chest. I was so afraid it was Roderick.

The person heard me and looked up. It was Timothy.

I pretended nothing was wrong, walking past him toward the roadside to hail a taxi. But he followed.

""Ms. Cantrell?""

I didn't answer.

""Does Mr. Cooke know you're...""

""Can you not tell Roderick?"" I cut in.

I held back my excitement, forcing myself to stay calm. I was so close to escaping. Why did I have to run into Timothy?

Timothy looked confused. ""Mr. Cooke will be worried.""

I shook my head frantically, then started pulling off my coat.

Timothy stepped back in a hurry, turning his head away, his ears turning red. ""Ms. Cantrell, what are you doing?""

If it meant I could get away, shame didn't matter anymore. My dignity had been worn away by Roderick long ago.

""He doesn't worry about me. He's the one who told those kidnappers to leave these scars on me.""

Timothy looked over. Under my coat was a white sleeveless top. He could clearly see the purple whip marks, blue bruises, and scabbed cuts covering my arms.

He looked stunned. Those shocking injuries were beyond anything he'd imagined.

While he froze, I hurried to pull my coat back on, begging, ""Timothy, please let me go. If you don't, I'll die.""

It was the first time I'd called him by his name. Before, I'd only referred to him as ""Roderick's pet"", just like the kidnappers had called me ""the Cooke family's pet.""

Timothy stood silent for a long time. I seized the chance to run toward the roadside to hail a taxi. Suddenly, a large hand grabbed my arm, but the instant he sensed the scars under my clothes, he jolted backward, letting me free immediately.

I almost burst into tears. ""Don't stop me...""

Timothy clenched his jaw and said in a firm tone, ""You can't get a taxi at midnight. I'll drive you.""

I was dumbfounded.

With a jumble of fear and hope, I got into Roderick's car again. Timothy carefully reached over and turned off the driving recorder first.

""Just make do with it. It won't take long.""

He assumed I was resisting taking Roderick's car, and truth be told, he was right. But if it let me break free from Roderick and the Cooke family, I didn't care about it at all.

Chapter 6

The car arrived at the community that the agent and I had settled on. I'd sent a text to the agent, telling them I wanted to move in immediately. Eager for the commission, the agent brought the contract and keys early, greeting us with a smile at the community entrance.

Timothy still looked worried. He followed me upstairs to see the apartment. It was a fully furnished duplex. It wasn't huge, but it had all the basic daily necessities I'd need.

""It's 120 square meters. This community's largest unit,"" the agent gushed. ""Ms. Cantrell, whether you live here alone or with your boyfriend, it's more than spacious enough.""

I glanced at Timothy. He stayed quiet, his head down as he flipped through the contract. Then he asked the agent for details on utilities, water, electricity, and air conditioning, and only handed me the contract once he'd confirmed everything was okay.

Somehow, I trusted him. Maybe it was because he'd never complained about my flailing punches and kicks when he pulled me out of Roderick's office. Or maybe it was because, when Roderick sent him to fetch me from bars, he'd chased off the men who tried to take advantage of me.

I didn't hesitate, signing the contract quickly. I pulled out my bank card and handed it to the agent. He swiped it on the POS machine, tossed a few flattering remarks at Timothy and me, then left happily.

The empty room now held only Timothy and me. He suddenly seemed ill at ease.

""Ms. Cantrell, I need to head back,"" he said.

I nodded, reaching automatically for a check to thank him. That was my habit. But then I froze, realizing I had no money on me.

I'd snuck out with nothing. I'd wanted to grab a few clothes, but my room was already taken by Carissa, let alone a checkbook.

""Timothy, how can I thank you?"" I asked.

Timothy looked a little surprised. ""You don't need to. It's my pleasure.""

I said nothing more. But if he ever needed something from me later, I'd never say no.

Timothy left. He had to get back to work. Before he went, he said, ""Get some good rest.""

I certainly wanted to rest. More than that, I felt like I could finally rest.

Over those dozens of kilometers on the run, I'd slept under farmland canopies and on low tree trunks. Calling it ""sleep"" was a stretch. I'd stayed tense the whole time, wary of anyone coming to catch me, of wild animals that might hurt me.

Back at the Cooke's villa, I'd been waiting for a chance to escape. Even when I sat on the soft guest room bed, I'd pinched the tender flesh on my inner thighs over and over just to stay awake.

I took off my shoes and went up to the bedroom. There was only a bare mattress on the large bed. I hadn't had time to buy any bedding.

Luckily, the duplex came with blackout curtains. I pulled them shut, collapsed onto the mattress, and fell into a deep sleep.

When I finally came to, I heard loud banging on the door. It was so loud it echoed through the apartment and the whole hallway.

But I'd slept too deeply. I sat up in the bed, frozen. I could barely move. It was as though my arms and legs had forgotten how to function.

Then I heard the lock cylinder hit the floor with a sharp click. That jolted me awake.

Who was it?

Chapter 7

Was it a kidnapper? Or Roderick? I scrambled to find something in the room to defend myself, but there was nothing.

I got up and hurried downstairs. Panic made me clumsy. I slipped and fell when there were only one or two steps left.

""Camille!""

A clear voice cut through the chaos. I looked up to see Timothy standing outside my door, with a shopping bag in hand, breathless and frantic.

He rushed over to help me up. ""Are you okay?""

I froze, confused, wondering what was happening.

Outside, a locksmith was replacing the door's lock core, then packing his tools into a tool bag.

""Oh, young lady,"" the locksmith said, ""your boyfriend's been knocking for two hours and you didn't answer. He was so worried about you.""

I held my head, still groggy. In that deep sleep, I really hadn't heard a thing.

The locksmith went on. ""He said you've got depression? He was so afraid you'd hurt yourself. Listen to me, girl, you're so young and beautiful. The future is yourself. Take it easy.""

I glanced at Timothy. Embarrassed, he let go of me and stepped toward the locksmith. ""Sir, that's enough. I'm not her boyfriend. How much for the new lock?""

After taking the money, the locksmith gave us a knowing look, slinging his tool bag over his shoulder. ""Young lady, he's a good guy. Why don't you give him a chance?""

Timothy slammed the door shut, avoiding my eyes.

He mumbled, ""Sorry, I was scared you might be ... in trouble. So I called the locksmith. I didn't tell him anything, I promise.""

I knew Timothy was straightforward. His emotions showed plainly on his face. He must have been truly panicked earlier, which was why the locksmith got the wrong idea.

""It's fine. I was just asleep."" Truth was, Timothy didn't need to worry about me like that. If I didn't cherish my life so fiercely, I never would have climbed back from that hell.

I licked my cracked lips. Timothy noticed, reaching into the shopping bag he'd dumped on the floor and pulling out a bottle of milk. He unscrewed the cap and handed it to me.

I took it, sipping slowly. It was ice-cold, like it had just come out of the freezer. He even remembered that I only liked drinking milk chilled.

Timothy glanced around the apartment before his eyes finally landed on me. I was still in that long dress, which was crumpled and a little messy now.

""How long have you been asleep?"" he asked, confused.

I thought for a second. ""Over two hours?""

Hadn't he said he'd been knocking for two hours?

Timothy's expression turned odd. ""Think again. It's been two days since you signed the contract.""

""Two days?""

I froze. Timothy was in casual clothes now, but I clearly remembered he'd been wearing a suit early in the morning.

Then I realized I'd slept for two whole days and nights without eating or drinking a thing.

Timothy then knew everything. He reached out and brushed the table. Sure enough, his finger came away dusty. I hadn't cleaned the apartment once since moving in.

He took off his black jacket, tossing it over a chair. A cloud of dust puffed up when the fabric hit the seat.

""Sit here, on my jacket,"" he said.

I didn't know what he was planning, but I walked over and did as he said.

He rolled up his sleeves and headed for the bathroom. After a clatter of water, Timothy came out with a wet rag, starting to wipe the dining table first, then moving to the coffee table and wardrobe.

""Just rest. Once I'm done cleaning, I'll take you to eat.""

Take me to eat? That thought seemed weird, especially paired with the sight of him cleaning my apartment. Timothy was Roderick's bodyguard, a man who spoke with his fists, yet he handled housework so carefully.

About an hour later, after mopping the floor, Timothy went back to the bathroom to splash some water on his face, then wrapped up his chores.

""Getting hungry?"" he asked.

Water droplets dripped from the tips of his wet hair. His sharp, rugged features softened into a lazy, natural grin.

I nodded in a daze, then shook my head again.

He laughed loudly. He stepped over, and it looked like he was about to reach up and touch my head. But then he paused, remembering something, and pulled his hand back.

""Let's go.""

Chapter 8

I stood up, and he picked up the jacket.

""How about French cuisine? It won't be spicy. I heard those girls talking about how delicious it is.""

Those ""girls"" must have been employees at Roderick's company. Timothy dealt with them sometimes. Had he gone so far as to ask them about restaurants, all because of me?

His words stirred a faint hunger in me. I'd slept for two full days, after all. And that night at the Cooke's villa, I'd barely eaten before vomiting it all up.

But I'd only taken two steps when a sharp cramp twisted my stomach. I stumbled to the bathroom, clutching the toilet to retch. There was nothing left in my stomach. So only bitter, brownish blood came up.

Timothy, who'd followed me in, grabbed my shoulders. I was so thin, and I felt like I was curling up in midair against him.

""Camille?""

He helped me to the sink and got some water for me to rinse my mouth.

""Did you go to the hospital for a checkup after you got back?"" he asked, his voice tight with seriousness.

I shook my head.

He lifted me up without hesitation, grabbing the keys before heading downstairs. The pain was so bad that I couldn't speak. In the taxi, he used the little first-aid know-how he had, pinching the webbing between my thumb and index finger to ease the stomachache.

""Sir, please, faster,"" Timothy urged. The driver glanced at me in the rearview mirror and silently pressed down harder on the gas.

I drifted in and out of consciousness through the whole exam. By the time the gastric lavage was over, Timothy walked into my ward with the report.

He sat on the edge of my bed, frown deep as he scanned the medical records. He was too tall for the hospital stool, so his long legs splayed, knees pushed up.

""Do you want to be hospitalized?"" he asked.

""What did the doctor say?""

""The doctor said it's not necessary, but...""

""Then I don't want to."" I hated places with constant comings and goings. I wouldn't feel safe.

Timothy was quiet for a moment. ""All right. But you'll have to come to the hospital every day for dressing changes and checkups.""

I could already feel that some of my wounds had been treated and bandaged.

""For now, you can only have liquid foods every day.""

I didn't need him to tell me why. I knew eating spoiled food and slop for three months had ruined my stomach.

""Timothy.""

""Yes?""

""But I'm so hungry right now...""

Timothy's eyes softened with obvious pity. He'd learned from the doctor that the food I ate wasn't digested at all. It just sat in my stomach, and I couldn't vomit it out, so a lavage became needed.

He laid a gentle hand on my forehead, as if to soothe me, and promised, ""I'll make your food taste good. Trust me, okay?""

Timothy kept his word. He was surprisingly skilled in the kitchen, turning the plainest cereal into something palatable with little tweaks.

Thanks to him, I felt my strength returning day by day.

Today, as I reached for a third share of cereal with milk at lunch, Timothy stopped me.

He grinned, his eyes crinkling. ""Sneaking one more share while I was juicing, little glutton?""

Foiled, I huffed and set the tableware in the sink. He put down the half-chopped fruit and stepped over. ""I'll wash up. Just go watch TV on the sofa.""

I nodded, upset. He suddenly caught my arm and pulled me back. I found myself pinned between the counter and his body.

""Mad at me for stopping the cereal? You won't talk to me?""

I stayed silent, my lips pursed. I just looked away.

He laughed, ""The doctor said starting tomorrow, you can have a proper meal. I'll take you for French cuisine.""

My eyes lit up. ""Really?""

""For sure.""

Timothy's expression softened with fondness. He let me go, patted my back gently, and nudged me toward the sofa before returning to the kitchen to finish his work.

I sat down and pulled out the bank card my parents had left me. Beyond the money inside, it held their last thoughts for me.

For a moment, I felt like the luckiest kid. Their love had never left me. Before their accident, they'd been planning for my future.

And Timothy felt like a gift they'd sent me.

I tucked the card away carefully. If it was meant to be my dowry, I'd keep it safe.

The TV was playing the news. After a snippet of music, a glaring headline flashed across the screen.

""The Cooke Family's Adopted Daughter Found Wandering Barefoot After Kidnapping. Ex-Noble Lady Now Disheveled, Acting Erratically.""

I switched off the TV instantly, my breath coming fast. I told myself over and over again that it was all over. I'd never see those people or Roderick again.

It took a long time for me to finally calm down. Then the doorbell rang.

I figured it was another delivery Timothy had ordered. He'd been the one designing and furnishing this apartment since I moved in, after all.

I didn't think twice, getting up to open the door. But standing outside was someone I never wanted to see again.",2,1763607025.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False
1p1rxdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1p1rxdi/which_air_fryer_toaster_oven_fits_best_in_a_small/,Which air fryer toaster oven fits best in a small kitchen?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been living in a tiny apartment for the past two years, and counter space is basically nonexistent. I wanted an air fryer toaster oven but kept thinking there's no way I could fit one without making my kitchen feel even more cramped.

Turns out I was wrong. You just need to know what to look for.

**Size Actually Matters Here**

The biggest mistake people make is assuming all air fryer toaster ovens are these massive machines. Some are, but plenty of compact models exist that can handle everyday cooking without eating up your entire counter.

I learned to check the dimensions before anything else. Look for something under 16 inches wide if you're really tight on space. Also, measure your counter and the area under your cabinets because height can be a sneaky problem.

**What Features You Actually Need**

Don't get caught up in fancy features you'll never use. For a small kitchen, you want something that can replace multiple appliances. That's the whole point, right?

I looked for models that could air fry, toast, bake, and broil. This way I could ditch my old toaster and maybe even use my regular oven less. Convection cooking is clutch too because it cooks faster and more evenly.

**My Research Process**

I spent way too much time reading reviews and comparing specs. If you want to skip all that, I found this helpful collection of compact convection ovens that actually fit in small spaces: [https://goodhomedeals.com/air-fryer-toaster-oven](https://goodhomedeals.com/air-fryer-toaster-oven)

They're all on Amazon, so you can check the exact measurements and read real customer reviews about how they fit in tight spaces.

**Capacity vs Size**

Here's something weird I noticed. Some smaller air fryer toaster ovens actually have better interior space than you'd think. It's all about the design. Look for ones that can fit at least 4 slices of toast or a 12-inch pizza. That's usually enough for two people, maybe three if you're not super hungry.

**The Corner Strategy**

One trick that worked for me was putting it in the corner of my counter. Sounds obvious, but I wasn't using that space well anyway. Just make sure there's a few inches of clearance on the sides for ventilation. These things get hot.

**Power and Cooking Performance**

Wattage matters for cooking speed. Most decent models run between 1200-1800 watts. Higher wattage means faster cooking, which is great when you're hungry and your kitchen is already warm.

I also learned that stainless steel models hold up better than plastic ones, especially in cramped kitchens where you might accidentally bump into stuff.

**Final Thoughts**

A small kitchen doesn't mean you can't have nice things. You just need to be smarter about what you buy. An air fryer toaster oven that actually fits your space will get used way more than one that sits in your closet because it's too bulky.

If you're ready to start comparing options, check out [https://goodhomedeals.com/air-fryer-toaster-oven](https://goodhomedeals.com/air-fryer-toaster-oven) and filter by dimensions. That's honestly the easiest way to find something that'll work.

My kitchen still isn't huge, but at least now I can make decent food without ordering takeout every night. And I actually have a bit of counter space left over for my coffee maker, which is really all that matters.",1,1763607010.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

Hey ladies 👋

1p1ruz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1p1ruz1/after_losing_20kg_and_almost_giving_up_i_finally/,"After losing 20kg and almost giving up, I finally healed my gastritis. Here's what actually worked.","Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my journey in case it helps someone going through something similar. It's been a hell of a ride. At one point I genuinely thought I was dying.

It started off with mild stomach pain after meals, acid reflux, and that constant feeling of fullness. I brushed it off at first, thinking it was temporary. But things escalated quickly. I couldn't eat properly anymore – everything seemed to hurt. I switched to light foods, but nothing helped.

I went to my GP, who prescribed Pantoprazole and told me to take it once daily for 2 weeks. It matched my symptoms, so I followed the plan. But it only got worse. I lost the ability to eat solid foods entirely. I began experiencing crippling stomach cramps – the kind that make you curl up in bed and cry. I couldn't walk. I could barely stand. I lived off water and vegetable broth. Every attempt at a real meal made me feel like I was about to die.

One day, the pain was so unbearable I called an ambulance. At the hospital, they gave me IV Pantoprazole, antacids, and lots of painkillers. The pain subsided a bit, but the bloating and discomfort remained. Something inside me told me I wasn't really getting better.

After a few tests, including an endoscopy, they diagnosed me with Type C Gastritis (chemical-induced gastritis). I was shocked. I don't smoke, I rarely drink, I eat fairly clean, and I don't even take NSAIDs. But they also found a gallstone. As expected, the first advice was immediate surgery – which I declined. I wanted answers first.

After a week in the hospital, I was discharged. But the pain persisted. Even high doses of Pantoprazole didn't help. The cramps started creeping back in, and I was losing my ability to function again. I had lost 20 kg in just 2 months.

Desperate, I sought a second opinion from a local gastroenterologist. He took my case seriously and dug deeper. He said my inflammation didn't even look that severe – so why was I suffering so much?

Together, we uncovered the likely causes:

* I drank black coffee every morning on an empty stomach.
* I was taking Accutane (Isotretinoin) for acne for over 2 years – often on an empty stomach or after only a small breakfast.
* I did OMAD and intermittent fasting, often bingeing on huge meals in the evening.
* I turned out to have a sensitivity to Pantoprazole, which affects 1 in 100 people (not rare in medical terms). It was likely the source of my extreme cramping.

**How I healed:**

**Step 1: Medication switch.** Pantoprazole was replaced with Esomeprazole, and the improvement was immediate. The cramps stopped. I could eat again. I felt like I was returning to life.

But that alone wasn't enough. I researched everything about healing the stomach lining. I built myself a strict set of rules:

* No red meat
* No processed food
* No sugar
* No gluten
* Only water and calming teas (like chamomile, fennel)
* No spicy or irritating foods
* Absolutely no alcohol for 6 months
* Only organic food

Within days, I felt better. But then I made the classic mistake. After a few weeks of feeling ""normal,"" I thought I was healed and stopped following the diet. I paid the price. My symptoms came back hard. It was a wake-up call.

So I went back on the plan. Strictly. For 4 months.

Honestly, the hardest part wasn't the restrictions – it was the boredom. Eating plain chicken, rice, and steamed vegetables every single day broke me mentally. I almost gave up several times because I felt like I was losing my mind. That's when I started looking for gastritis-friendly recipes that actually had some variety and taste to them. I found a newsletter that sends out safe meal ideas weekly and it legitimately saved my sanity during the healing process: [https://gentlegourmet.app/newsletter](https://gentlegourmet.app/newsletter)

**The result:**

I'm now functionally healed. I eat and drink whatever I want – within reason. My doctor warned me: once you've had this, you're always vulnerable. You have to stay mindful.

A night out with friends and a few drinks? Sure. Alcohol every weekend, careless eating, no rhythm? No way. That life is gone – and honestly, it probably should be for everyone.

**My advice if you're struggling:**

* Check your medications – even the ones you think are harmless.
* Don't underestimate coffee, Accutane, fasting, or stress.
* Stick to your healing diet for several months – not weeks.
* Be kind to yourself.

Healing isn't just about pills. It's about behavior, discipline, and self-awareness.

You can get your life back. But you have to fight for it – and keep fighting, even when it feels better.

If you're going through this, I see you. You're not alone.",23,1763606816.0,Gastritis,5,0.93,False

After escaping, I dressed in rags and my feet lacerated and filthy.

No one knew what I had suffered.

I stepped forward on my injured feet. A trail of bloody footprints marked my path.

In the enclosed space, the full force of my odor finally reached him—the pungent mix of blood, sweat, and the fetid decay of mud and garbage.

'You stink,"" he frowned.

""I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. I won't dirty the seats.""

I suddenly kneeled onto the floor.

There were still bloody holes in my knees.

""You can do whatever you want to me...""

I tried to be a good girl, but he looked even angrier.

""What the hel are you doing?!""

Chapter 1

I was in love with Roderick Cooke for seven years. When I was kidnapped, he didn't pay the ransom, all because his female secretary suggested using the opportunity to teach me a lesson—to make me behave.

I endured hellish torture and finally learned to stay away from Roderick. Yet, he cried and begged me for another chance.

\*\*\*

The day I walked barefoot back into the city, I made the news.

Camille Cantrell—the Cooke family's adopted daughter, kidnapped for months—had finally escaped. Dressed in rags, her feet lacerated and filthy, she had stumbled back to civilization.

Reporters swarmed, their camera flashes exploding around me. Facing the blinding glare, I felt nothing. I was already dead inside.

The Camille Cantrell of the past was gone. That bright, dazzling, willful, and vivacious girl had been destroyed—by the kidnappers, and by Roderick.

Soon, a group of black-clad bodyguards carved a path through the crowd. Their leader was Timothy Glisson. I knew him. During my seven years of pestering Roderick, it was always Timothy who had ""seen me off"" from Roderick's office and apartment.

""Seen me off"" was a polite term. More often, it involved dragging me out, a consequence of my persistence and Roderick's extreme repulsion toward me.

""Ms. Cantrell, Mr. Cooke is waiting for you in the car. This way.""

Timothy's gaze faltered as it landed on me. Clearly, I was far more wretched than he had anticipated.

I nodded and stepped forward on my injured feet. A trail of bloody footprints marked my path. The pain had long since numbed, and this short distance was nothing compared to my flight for survival.

Following behind me, Timothy couldn't help but call out, ""Ms. Cantrell...""

I didn't respond. Did he pity me? He should be relieved, in fact. After this ""lesson"", I would never pester Roderick again. And of course, I would no longer cause his job extra trouble.

When I stepped into the car, I saw Roderick in the back seat, eyes closed, resting. His dark hair was impeccably styled, his features exquisitely chiseled.

I imagined my absence had brought him unprecedented peace. Of course, he was in excellent condition.

Hearing the disturbance, Roderick slowly opened his eyes. For a moment, he didn't recognize me. ""Camille?""

I nodded obediently. Yes, I had learned to behave. Before, I had never cared about my status as the Cooke family's adopted daughter. I had held my head high, throwing my weight around as if I were their true heir. But the kidnapping taught me the truth—the Cooke family owned my life. If they refused to pay the ransom, I would die.

Roderick frowned, a flicker of displeasure crossing his face. ""How did you end up like this?""

Like this? What was ""this""? A madwoman? A beggar? I had trekked dozens of kilometers, terrified to close my eyes for a second. Beyond the kidnappers, I had to guard against wild animals in the suburban forests. I drank rainwater and scavenged from highway trash piles. Anyone in my position would go crazy.

I understood his displeasure. My appearance before the media was an embarrassment, likely bringing trouble to his company—the Cooke family's company, to be exact.

""I'm sorry,"" I said. I apologized for offending his sight.

Roderick paused, then a faint smile touched his lips. ""She was right. You've learned to behave.""

I didn't know what he meant. The car door closed, and we began to move. Suddenly, he reached out toward me. I instinctively shrank back into the corner. He stopped, his expression twisting with disdain. ""Camille, you stink.""

Perhaps in the enclosed space, the full force of my odor finally reached him—the pungent mix of blood, sweat, and the fetid decay of mud and garbage.

At his words, I shifted further away. But the car hit a bump, and I slid onto the floor.

""I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. I won't dirty the seats. I'll just..."" I'd just stay down here.

Chapter 2

It hurts so much. There were still bloody holes in my knees where the kidnappers stabbed me. They blamed me, saying I meant nothing at all to Roderick. Since no ransom came, they had wasted their time, so they took their anger out on me.

I couldn't stand, so I simply maintained such a position in that small space.

Roderick flew into a rage instantly. He ordered me, ""What the hell are you doing? Get back to your seat!""

His face showed repulsion, and he didn't move an inch to help me up. I had no choice but to obey, straining to prop myself up and sit back down. The pain, combined with days of low blood sugar, forced tears from my eyes.

Roderick had always ignored my tears, only looking annoyed. But this time, for the first time, he tossed the handkerchief he'd wiped his hands with at me.

I clutched the clean, white cloth tightly. Once, this would have made me ecstatic, but now, the handkerchief only highlighted how filthy and tattered I was.

Timothy glanced at me in the rearview mirror. I bowed my head. He'd probably never seen me so humiliatingly ridiculous.

When the car pulled back to the Cooke's villa, Roderick ordered me taken to the bathroom to clean up. I refused the servants' help, only asking them to fetch a floor-length dress from my old wardrobe.

They rummaged around, finally pulling out a prim long-sleeved dress, like a school uniform, from among the trendy clothes.

No one defines how students should dress, but staring at myself in the mirror, I did look more like a student than in my previous styles.

I remembered that before the kidnapping, I'd gotten an offer from a top foreign design school. But now, three months had passed since the enrollment deadline.

""Thank you.""

The servants looked startled, not expecting gratitude from me.

But after all this, I knew clearly that deep down, I was no different from them. They were servants hired by the Cooke family, while I was a daughter hired by the Cooke family.

When I pushed open the door and stepped out, I saw Roderick standing at the top of the stairs, waiting for me. He leaned half against the railing, lazily sizing me up, then sneered.

""Camille, what game are you playing? Dressed like this.""

Did he think it was tacky? Roderick probably took it for another childish trick to get his attention, but I just wanted to cover the scars on my body.

I followed him to the dining room. It was so quiet. Not until Roderick nodded for me to step forward did I see my adopted parents, Kaleb and Talia Cooke, at the table, their faces tight with worry.

The second Talia saw me, she stood up, nearly rushing over. Her steps faltered, and a woman beside her quickly steadied her.

""Madam Cooke, don't fret. Isn't Ms. Cantrell back safe and sound?"" The woman then turned to me. ""Ms. Cantrell, Madam Cooke has been terribly worried about you. Her hair even turned grey overnight.""

I knew her. She was Roderick's secretary, Carissa Barron.

Her hair fell in natural black waves, and she wore a plain turtleneck and jeans. But around her neck hung a delicate rose gold necklace.

""Safe and sound""? She said it like a contrast to Talia's graying hair. With just one sentence, I was no longer a victim but the Cooke family's ungrateful member.

Talia pulled me into a sobbing hug, and Carissa patted her back to comfort her. But I couldn't cry. I looked at Roderick, and his eyes seemed to say, ""You're so ungrateful.""

Finally, Kaleb cut in, his voice sharp with authority. ""Stop clinging to Camille. Let her sit and eat.""

Talia wiped her tears, forcing a smile. ""It's my fault. Millie, you've been through so much. You must have starved. Here, I made your favorite apple pie!""

Talia tugged me to a seat between her and Kaleb. Roderick sat across from me, and Carissa settled right beside him.

How perfectly family they all looked.

Chapter 3

I stared at the food on my plate. It looked so aromatic and appetizing. I'd almost forgotten what normal food tasted like. For a second, I wanted to hurl the fork aside, grab the food with my hands, and stuff it into my mouth.

The closer we'd gotten to the city highway, the stricter the sanitation management had been. Gradually, I couldn't find any dumps, which meant no food. I'd gone nearly three days hungry, reduced to eating leaves to survive.

Under everyone's gaze, I forced myself to stay composed, picking up the fork to send food into my mouth. Even so, I caught Carissa's mocking glance. She ate in tiny, dainty bites, flaunting her poise.

Roderick, seeing this, clearly grew more repelled. But at Talia's nudge, he reluctantly placed a piece of BBQ ribs on my plate with his own hand.

I'd thought I could choke down even the blandest food, but I just stared at those tempting BBQ ribs. Knowing Roderick had put them there, I felt my stomach churn with revulsion.

""Millie, try it,"" Talia urged. ""Roderick knew you liked BBQ flavor, so he asked the chef to make this extra dish just for you.""

Bullshit. Roderick had no idea what I liked. If anything, I knew his preferences well. For instance, among all types of gold, rose gold was his favorite.

Seeing me hesitate, Kaleb asked gently, ""What's wrong, Millie? Did you and Roderick argue on the way back? Don't worry, I'll teach him a lesson after dinner.""

""Dad!"" Roderick snapped, likely humiliated in front of Carissa.

I shook my head, said nothing, and forced down the physical disgust, spearing the ribs with my fork and putting them in my mouth.

But the second I swallowed, I retched, vomiting it all up.

Roderick looked stunned. I shot up from my chair, clutching my head, and cowered in the corner.

""I'm sorry. I'll eat it! Don't hit me!""

Everyone froze. Talia's tears spilled again as she rushed over to hug me. ""Did they hurt you, Millie? Tell me. Did they abuse you?""

Kaleb and Roderick came over, too. Kaleb's face softened with care, looking at me with pity.

Roderick frowned, silent, his expression unreasonably dark.

What was this about? Hadn't the kidnappers threatened the Cooke family, saying that if they didn't pay the ransom, their adopted daughter would suffer?

Why were they asking me now if I'd been abused?

Actually, back then, even a rotten sandwich or a spoiled bottle of milk never struck me as abuse. After all, what I got to eat afterward was nothing but slop.

I was just so scared of feeling like my life hung in Roderick's hands.

The kidnappers had negotiated with him personally, but he'd chosen to give up on me. He hated me so much.

I think that was where my physical nausea came from.

After dinner, I was called to Kaleb's study.

Kaleb set aside his usual sharp, business-like demeanor, asking me gently and patiently, ""Millie, you've loved Roderick since you were little. Do you still like him now?""

I shook my head wildly, so violently that the muscles in my cheeks felt a sharp ache.

I'd loved Roderick for seven years, and it meant I've spent seven years living humbly and suffering. But I'd never learned my lesson. This time, I'd endured hellish torment, and that was the revenge for me.

I couldn't dare to like Roderick anymore.

Kaleb heard my answer and paused thoughtfully before sighing regretfully, ""Well, fine. You might not be my daughter-in-law, but you'll always be our daughter. Millie, you're such a perfect, beautiful girl. It's just that Roderick doesn't deserve you.""

He pulled a bank card from his desk drawer. ""Your parents left this for you. It has 600 thousand dollars in it. They told me to keep it secure and give it to you as a dowry once you were older.""

600 thousand dollars. It was the same as the ransom sum.

During those days of being kidnapped, I'd even resented my parents, blaming them for not taking me with them, leaving me to endure this torture. I hadn't done anything wrong.

It turned out they'd left me enough to live comfortably as well. Their love for me had been deeper than I knew.

I bit my thumb to hold back my tears.

""Thank you, Kaleb.""

It was already eight o'clock when I left the study. I headed for my room, only to run into Roderick halfway.

He seemed to guess where I was going, and his tone was surprisingly soft when he said, ""Carissa will stay in your room tonight. You'll take the guest room next to mine.""

I could see that all he cared about was Carissa.

I nodded and turned to walk the other way. When I settled into the Cooke's villa, Roderick's hatred for me was so strong that he relocated his room to the farthest spot from mine: his at the east end, mine at the west.

But my room had been decorated by a top designer at the Cooke family's request, far nicer than most.

Yet it was still the Cooke family's property. If Roderick told me to give it up, I had no choice but to obey.

I'd taken a few steps when Roderick called after me. ""Camille, why are you suddenly so obedient?""

Chapter 4

I turned around and saw that his face held both sarcasm and a faint flicker of worry.

""I'm sorry,"" I mumbled, hesitating. Beyond apologies, I had no idea what else to say to Roderick.

""That's the third time you've apologized to me today. You're acting weird."" Roderick stepped closer, leaning in as if to touch my forehead.

I flinched away as fast as if shocked by electricity. By the time I clung to the corridor railing to steady myself, my legs were so weak I could barely stand.

Roderick stared at me like I was insane, his patience fraying into annoyance.

I forced down the tremor in my voice. ""I ... I'll move out tomorrow. I already told Kaleb.""

I'd thought Roderick would be relieved to hear it, so that he'd let me go. Instead, his face darkened with anger.

""Move out? Why? I only asked you to let Carissa stay in your room temporarily. She's a guest here. Can't you just make that tiny concession? It won't cost you much.""

I shook my head quickly. ""No, that's not it.""

Roderick's jaw tightened. He grabbed my wrist roughly and dragged me toward the easternmost room.

""Come with me. I need to talk to you.""

Fear flooded my mind. Through tears, I fumbled for the bank card Kaleb had just given me, holding it out. ""I'm sorry. I have money now. Don't hit me.

""I can pay you. Please don't hit me.""

Roderick froze, turning around in shock. I'd crumpled to the floor, but he was still gripping my wrist in a tight clamp.

""Camille, what are you talking about?""

By then, I'd bitten my lips so hard that they'd turned purple. As Roderick's face drew closer, the kidnappers' taunts flooded back. ""You're just the Cooke family's pet, still clinging to your owner.""

""Rody, no. Mr. Cooke, I won't pester you anymore. I'll never dare again.""

Roderick finally sensed something was off with my state of mind. His movements softened. He slipped an arm around my waist and lifted me from the floor.

The sudden weightlessness made me cling to his neck instinctively. At that, the tightness in his expression finally eased a little.

""Camille, it's not that I don't want you to pester me, but...""

He didn't finish. The corridor door clicked open, and Carissa poked her head out of my room, the lights behind her bright.

She covered her mouth, feigning surprise. ""Mr. Cooke, Ms. Cantrell.""

Roderick's mood soured. ""You have the room. What else do you need?""

Carissa's voice turned wronged. ""The Australian branch is having a video conference. They need you to attend in person, Mr. Cooke.""

Roderick glanced at me in his arms, then let go. My body went rigid, and words were stuck in my throat.

""Wait for me in my room.""

After Roderick said that, he walked toward Carissa. The two stepped into the room, and the door clicked shut behind them.

The bright light vanished from the corridor, leaving me with a shaky sense of relief, like I'd narrowly escaped danger. Cold sweat had soaked through the back of my clothes.

Roderick wouldn't come back. I knew Carissa's tricks too well. She'd pulled him away like this so many times: on my birthday, at my graduation. Perhaps he'd intended all along to stay away from me and never return.

And I had to leave as soon as I could. I needed to go somewhere I'd never see Roderick again. I was so scared that if I had to face him even once more, I'd lose my mind.

Chapter 5

I sat on the guest room bed until 3 a.m. Roderick's bedroom, the one next to mine, stayed completely quiet the whole time.

In between, I used the phone Talia had given me to log into a rental app. I found an apartment with good security that was available immediately.

As soon as dawn broke, the Cooke's villa still silent, I grabbed my leather shoes and snuck out barefoot.

Stepping outside, I froze. I saw someone leaning against Roderick's car, playing with his phone. My heart jumped in my chest. I was so afraid it was Roderick.

The person heard me and looked up. It was Timothy.

I pretended nothing was wrong, walking past him toward the roadside to hail a taxi. But he followed.

""Ms. Cantrell?""

I didn't answer.

""Does Mr. Cooke know you're...""

""Can you not tell Roderick?"" I cut in.

I held back my excitement, forcing myself to stay calm. I was so close to escaping. Why did I have to run into Timothy?

Timothy looked confused. ""Mr. Cooke will be worried.""

I shook my head frantically, then started pulling off my coat.

Timothy stepped back in a hurry, turning his head away, his ears turning red. ""Ms. Cantrell, what are you doing?""

If it meant I could get away, shame didn't matter anymore. My dignity had been worn away by Roderick long ago.

""He doesn't worry about me. He's the one who told those kidnappers to leave these scars on me.""

Timothy looked over. Under my coat was a white sleeveless top. He could clearly see the purple whip marks, blue bruises, and scabbed cuts covering my arms.

He looked stunned. Those shocking injuries were beyond anything he'd imagined.

While he froze, I hurried to pull my coat back on, begging, ""Timothy, please let me go. If you don't, I'll die.""

It was the first time I'd called him by his name. Before, I'd only referred to him as ""Roderick's pet"", just like the kidnappers had called me ""the Cooke family's pet.""

Timothy stood silent for a long time. I seized the chance to run toward the roadside to hail a taxi. Suddenly, a large hand grabbed my arm, but the instant he sensed the scars under my clothes, he jolted backward, letting me free immediately.

I almost burst into tears. ""Don't stop me...""

Timothy clenched his jaw and said in a firm tone, ""You can't get a taxi at midnight. I'll drive you.""

I was dumbfounded.

With a jumble of fear and hope, I got into Roderick's car again. Timothy carefully reached over and turned off the driving recorder first.

""Just make do with it. It won't take long.""

He assumed I was resisting taking Roderick's car, and truth be told, he was right. But if it let me break free from Roderick and the Cooke family, I didn't care about it at all.

Chapter 6

The car arrived at the community that the agent and I had settled on. I'd sent a text to the agent, telling them I wanted to move in immediately. Eager for the commission, the agent brought the contract and keys early, greeting us with a smile at the community entrance.

Timothy still looked worried. He followed me upstairs to see the apartment. It was a fully furnished duplex. It wasn't huge, but it had all the basic daily necessities I'd need.

""It's 120 square meters. This community's largest unit,"" the agent gushed. ""Ms. Cantrell, whether you live here alone or with your boyfriend, it's more than spacious enough.""

I glanced at Timothy. He stayed quiet, his head down as he flipped through the contract. Then he asked the agent for details on utilities, water, electricity, and air conditioning, and only handed me the contract once he'd confirmed everything was okay.

Somehow, I trusted him. Maybe it was because he'd never complained about my flailing punches and kicks when he pulled me out of Roderick's office. Or maybe it was because, when Roderick sent him to fetch me from bars, he'd chased off the men who tried to take advantage of me.

I didn't hesitate, signing the contract quickly. I pulled out my bank card and handed it to the agent. He swiped it on the POS machine, tossed a few flattering remarks at Timothy and me, then left happily.

The empty room now held only Timothy and me. He suddenly seemed ill at ease.

""Ms. Cantrell, I need to head back,"" he said.

I nodded, reaching automatically for a check to thank him. That was my habit. But then I froze, realizing I had no money on me.

I'd snuck out with nothing. I'd wanted to grab a few clothes, but my room was already taken by Carissa, let alone a checkbook.

""Timothy, how can I thank you?"" I asked.

Timothy looked a little surprised. ""You don't need to. It's my pleasure.""

I said nothing more. But if he ever needed something from me later, I'd never say no.

Timothy left. He had to get back to work. Before he went, he said, ""Get some good rest.""

I certainly wanted to rest. More than that, I felt like I could finally rest.

Over those dozens of kilometers on the run, I'd slept under farmland canopies and on low tree trunks. Calling it ""sleep"" was a stretch. I'd stayed tense the whole time, wary of anyone coming to catch me, of wild animals that might hurt me.

Back at the Cooke's villa, I'd been waiting for a chance to escape. Even when I sat on the soft guest room bed, I'd pinched the tender flesh on my inner thighs over and over just to stay awake.

I took off my shoes and went up to the bedroom. There was only a bare mattress on the large bed. I hadn't had time to buy any bedding.

Luckily, the duplex came with blackout curtains. I pulled them shut, collapsed onto the mattress, and fell into a deep sleep.

When I finally came to, I heard loud banging on the door. It was so loud it echoed through the apartment and the whole hallway.

But I'd slept too deeply. I sat up in the bed, frozen. I could barely move. It was as though my arms and legs had forgotten how to function.

Then I heard the lock cylinder hit the floor with a sharp click. That jolted me awake.

Who was it?

Chapter 7

Was it a kidnapper? Or Roderick? I scrambled to find something in the room to defend myself, but there was nothing.

I got up and hurried downstairs. Panic made me clumsy. I slipped and fell when there were only one or two steps left.

""Camille!""

A clear voice cut through the chaos. I looked up to see Timothy standing outside my door, with a shopping bag in hand, breathless and frantic.

He rushed over to help me up. ""Are you okay?""

I froze, confused, wondering what was happening.

Outside, a locksmith was replacing the door's lock core, then packing his tools into a tool bag.

""Oh, young lady,"" the locksmith said, ""your boyfriend's been knocking for two hours and you didn't answer. He was so worried about you.""

I held my head, still groggy. In that deep sleep, I really hadn't heard a thing.

The locksmith went on. ""He said you've got depression? He was so afraid you'd hurt yourself. Listen to me, girl, you're so young and beautiful. The future is yourself. Take it easy.""

I glanced at Timothy. Embarrassed, he let go of me and stepped toward the locksmith. ""Sir, that's enough. I'm not her boyfriend. How much for the new lock?""

After taking the money, the locksmith gave us a knowing look, slinging his tool bag over his shoulder. ""Young lady, he's a good guy. Why don't you give him a chance?""

Timothy slammed the door shut, avoiding my eyes.

He mumbled, ""Sorry, I was scared you might be ... in trouble. So I called the locksmith. I didn't tell him anything, I promise.""

I knew Timothy was straightforward. His emotions showed plainly on his face. He must have been truly panicked earlier, which was why the locksmith got the wrong idea.

""It's fine. I was just asleep."" Truth was, Timothy didn't need to worry about me like that. If I didn't cherish my life so fiercely, I never would have climbed back from that hell.

I licked my cracked lips. Timothy noticed, reaching into the shopping bag he'd dumped on the floor and pulling out a bottle of milk. He unscrewed the cap and handed it to me.

I took it, sipping slowly. It was ice-cold, like it had just come out of the freezer. He even remembered that I only liked drinking milk chilled.

Timothy glanced around the apartment before his eyes finally landed on me. I was still in that long dress, which was crumpled and a little messy now.

""How long have you been asleep?"" he asked, confused.

I thought for a second. ""Over two hours?""

Hadn't he said he'd been knocking for two hours?

Timothy's expression turned odd. ""Think again. It's been two days since you signed the contract.""

""Two days?""

I froze. Timothy was in casual clothes now, but I clearly remembered he'd been wearing a suit early in the morning.

Then I realized I'd slept for two whole days and nights without eating or drinking a thing.

Timothy then knew everything. He reached out and brushed the table. Sure enough, his finger came away dusty. I hadn't cleaned the apartment once since moving in.

He took off his black jacket, tossing it over a chair. A cloud of dust puffed up when the fabric hit the seat.

""Sit here, on my jacket,"" he said.

I didn't know what he was planning, but I walked over and did as he said.

He rolled up his sleeves and headed for the bathroom. After a clatter of water, Timothy came out with a wet rag, starting to wipe the dining table first, then moving to the coffee table and wardrobe.

""Just rest. Once I'm done cleaning, I'll take you to eat.""

Take me to eat? That thought seemed weird, especially paired with the sight of him cleaning my apartment. Timothy was Roderick's bodyguard, a man who spoke with his fists, yet he handled housework so carefully.

About an hour later, after mopping the floor, Timothy went back to the bathroom to splash some water on his face, then wrapped up his chores.

""Getting hungry?"" he asked.

Water droplets dripped from the tips of his wet hair. His sharp, rugged features softened into a lazy, natural grin.

I nodded in a daze, then shook my head again.

He laughed loudly. He stepped over, and it looked like he was about to reach up and touch my head. But then he paused, remembering something, and pulled his hand back.

""Let's go.""

Chapter 8

I stood up, and he picked up the jacket.

""How about French cuisine? It won't be spicy. I heard those girls talking about how delicious it is.""

Those ""girls"" must have been employees at Roderick's company. Timothy dealt with them sometimes. Had he gone so far as to ask them about restaurants, all because of me?

His words stirred a faint hunger in me. I'd slept for two full days, after all. And that night at the Cooke's villa, I'd barely eaten before vomiting it all up.

But I'd only taken two steps when a sharp cramp twisted my stomach. I stumbled to the bathroom, clutching the toilet to retch. There was nothing left in my stomach. So only bitter, brownish blood came up.

Timothy, who'd followed me in, grabbed my shoulders. I was so thin, and I felt like I was curling up in midair against him.

""Camille?""

He helped me to the sink and got some water for me to rinse my mouth.

""Did you go to the hospital for a checkup after you got back?"" he asked, his voice tight with seriousness.

I shook my head.

He lifted me up without hesitation, grabbing the keys before heading downstairs. The pain was so bad that I couldn't speak. In the taxi, he used the little first-aid know-how he had, pinching the webbing between my thumb and index finger to ease the stomachache.

""Sir, please, faster,"" Timothy urged. The driver glanced at me in the rearview mirror and silently pressed down harder on the gas.

I drifted in and out of consciousness through the whole exam. By the time the gastric lavage was over, Timothy walked into my ward with the report.

He sat on the edge of my bed, frown deep as he scanned the medical records. He was too tall for the hospital stool, so his long legs splayed, knees pushed up.

""Do you want to be hospitalized?"" he asked.

""What did the doctor say?""

""The doctor said it's not necessary, but...""

""Then I don't want to."" I hated places with constant comings and goings. I wouldn't feel safe.

Timothy was quiet for a moment. ""All right. But you'll have to come to the hospital every day for dressing changes and checkups.""

I could already feel that some of my wounds had been treated and bandaged.

""For now, you can only have liquid foods every day.""

I didn't need him to tell me why. I knew eating spoiled food and slop for three months had ruined my stomach.

""Timothy.""

""Yes?""

""But I'm so hungry right now...""

Timothy's eyes softened with obvious pity. He'd learned from the doctor that the food I ate wasn't digested at all. It just sat in my stomach, and I couldn't vomit it out, so a lavage became needed.

He laid a gentle hand on my forehead, as if to soothe me, and promised, ""I'll make your food taste good. Trust me, okay?""

Timothy kept his word. He was surprisingly skilled in the kitchen, turning the plainest cereal into something palatable with little tweaks.

Thanks to him, I felt my strength returning day by day.

Today, as I reached for a third share of cereal with milk at lunch, Timothy stopped me.

He grinned, his eyes crinkling. ""Sneaking one more share while I was juicing, little glutton?""

Foiled, I huffed and set the tableware in the sink. He put down the half-chopped fruit and stepped over. ""I'll wash up. Just go watch TV on the sofa.""

I nodded, upset. He suddenly caught my arm and pulled me back. I found myself pinned between the counter and his body.

""Mad at me for stopping the cereal? You won't talk to me?""

I stayed silent, my lips pursed. I just looked away.

He laughed, ""The doctor said starting tomorrow, you can have a proper meal. I'll take you for French cuisine.""

My eyes lit up. ""Really?""

""For sure.""

Timothy's expression softened with fondness. He let me go, patted my back gently, and nudged me toward the sofa before returning to the kitchen to finish his work.

I sat down and pulled out the bank card my parents had left me. Beyond the money inside, it held their last thoughts for me.

For a moment, I felt like the luckiest kid. Their love had never left me. Before their accident, they'd been planning for my future.

And Timothy felt like a gift they'd sent me.

I tucked the card away carefully. If it was meant to be my dowry, I'd keep it safe.

The TV was playing the news. After a snippet of music, a glaring headline flashed across the screen.

""The Cooke Family's Adopted Daughter Found Wandering Barefoot After Kidnapping. Ex-Noble Lady Now Disheveled, Acting Erratically.""

I switched off the TV instantly, my breath coming fast. I told myself over and over again that it was all over. I'd never see those people or Roderick again.

It took a long time for me to finally calm down. Then the doorbell rang.

I figured it was another delivery Timothy had ordered. He'd been the one designing and furnishing this apartment since I moved in, after all.

I didn't think twice, getting up to open the door. But standing outside was someone I never wanted to see again.

This is not a story about a magical success, but about several attempts at the same dream.



It all began in a very ordinary way: a regular job, fairly stable, but the kind that starts to feel tight on the inside as the years go by.

Electric work, switchboards, cables – a normal profession, a normal life.

Only you catch yourself thinking more and more often: “Is this really what I want to be doing for another ten years in a row?”



To make things even more fun, at some point I somehow ended up surrounded by programmer friends. From random meet‑ups, walks, shared hobbies – you pick out people you want to keep talking to.

And these days a lot of smart, decent people are in intellectual fields.

What they saw in talking to me is still a mystery wrapped in darkness.



At some point my patience snapped, and instead of the usual “someday later” it turned into a firm “no, right now”.

The most obvious path at that moment was “web development”. You open the internet, type “how to get into IT”, and you instantly get whacked over the head by the holy trinity of HTML/CSS/JavaScript.



I did exactly what many people tell you not to do: I quit my job and sat down to study as if it were a full work shift. Not “an hour in the evening”, but a proper “this is my main activity now” mode.



I managed to slip for free into a course from one well‑known online school. What can I say? There was more water there than in my kettle.

Not completely useless, but still: their business is to keep you studying, preferably for years and preferably for a lot of money.

Whether you actually learn anything is your business. Anyway, you shouldn’t blindly listen to random people on the internet like me, by the way. I digress.



Mornings – coffee and tutorials, daytime – practice, evenings – debugging mistakes and yet another course.

Yes, another course. Turns out you have to pull information from different sources.

You can’t really be “taught” something; you can only “teach yourself” – I heard that somewhere, didn’t come up with it on my own.



Frontend slowly filled all the space around me.

First pet projects appeared, some landing pages, tiny little apps. The “portfolio” was slowly puffing up, same as my head, but my confidence – not so much.



Once it came to CVs and interviews, illusions started to fall one by one. On paper, “junior frontend developer” sounds nice, but in reality there are hundreds, thousands of such resumes.

You can’t just wave a pair of shorts at that many people who want to lie on a beach in Bali with a smoothie in hand.



A couple of interviews, polite rejections, long “we’ll definitely get back to you” pauses – and they don’t get back. Classic.

At some point it became clear: the world does not owe you a round of applause just because you suddenly decided to change your life.



Meanwhile, my wife had her own storyline running in parallel. She also chose to change her profession, went into design – and in her case it actually worked out.

New job, interesting projects, people who are genuinely happy with the results of her work. I was honestly happy for her.

But inside it highlighted a pretty sharp contrast: “here’s a person who tried and hit the target, and you tried and… well, not really.”



Savings are not infinite. At some point it became obvious: the experiment had to be stopped. I folded up my frontend saga and went back to my usual job.

From a survival standpoint – the right decision. From the inside – it felt like hitting the “revert changes” button.



But as it turned out later, once you dive deep enough into this rabbit hole, you don’t really go back to “the old you”.

It keeps pulling you further in.

Like a climber who has just conquered a small rock and, still out of breath, is already staring at a bigger one. Or something like that, I don’t know. You can come up with a prettier metaphor yourself.



This is the point where many stories end. Seriously, a lot of them.

Someone honestly tried, got burned, concluded “it’s not for me” and goes on living, joking about that old attempt. I also tried to do exactly that.



A one‑and‑a‑half‑year pause began. No courses, no “one more React video”.

I deliberately pushed the topic aside: work, home, some old hobbies, a TV show in the evening – life went back to being “normal”.



I almost managed to forget. Almost.



And that’s when our beloved IT world walked back into frame for the second time in the shape of a single book… and a very insistent “what if we try again, but differently this time?”. 



Now all this has resulted in an attempt to make my own game about mechs in Unity, but that’s another chapter.",0,1763606565.0,Unity3D,1,0.5,False

She came over to my house because she wanted to spend the night. I made coffee and poured us both a cup. I went to the bathroom before drinking mine. 

When I came out, she hadn't touched hers. I sipped mine then she did. 

I jokingly said that I didn't drug it, and she said that she just wanted to be sure. 

I was just joking, but I guess she was serious. I asked her why she came over if she doesn't trust me. She said that she trusts me, but just force of habit. 

I told her that I want her to leave, and that it made no sense for us to sleep together/be alone if there's no trust. She tried to reason with me for a few minutes, but I didn't back down. 

She texted later, and said that she's not interested in seeing me if I'm going to victim blame. I just responded that it's stupid to do what she did, if she didn't trust me. She's an adult.

I blocked her because I got nervous. Maybe I rushed to get her out of my house, but I don't think it made sense. 

Edit: I poured it from the same pot, and both cups were initially upside down (as I always put clean cups). I only do single-cup presses for myself, if I'm alone.",1,1763606552.0,AITAH,40,0.53,False

(Fun reason),"**TL;DR** I'm competing in a family cooking contest and need advice on making 3 traditional Vietnamese dishes. I have a rough plan and have started practicing, but I want to get these right. I love Vietnamese food and I want to win.

\--

**The Cooking Contest**

Every winter break, my in-laws host a cooking competition where 2 family members make an appetizer, main course, and dessert from scratch, all dishes from a specific country selected by a family member. That family member also selects the specific dishes to be served. Each course is presented blindly (A + B) and non-cooking family members rate each dish on **taste**, **presentation**, and **texture**.

This is my first year competing. I will be cooking against/alongside my brother-in-law in a shared rental kitchen - so planning equipment and timing is essential! I will not know his versions of the 3 dishes until the day of. I want to be prepared to win - and would appreciate any advice or corrections.

\---

**Our Required Menu + some of my plan/questions**

Please also help me get the spelling/grammar correct here.

Each of the 3 overall menu items are locked in (though the 3rd one is open to interpretation):

**1) Appetizer: Bánh Mì Thịt Nướng (Grilled pork bánh mì)**

* Gonna make my own baguettes too - advice? [recipe](https://vickypham.com/blog/vietnamese-banh-mi-baguettes/) (haven't tried it yet)
* Sauce [recipe](https://www.tiktok.com/@tommyphameats/video/7273464755812109570)
* **Looking for advice on** pork cut (shoulder vs something else), marinade recommendations, indoor grilling technique, ideal toppings and ratios

**2) Main Course: Cơm Gà Nướng + Nước Chấm (Lemongrass chicken + rice/sauce)**

* Open to any tips and advice
* I'm also considering adding **Gỏi Bắp Cải** (cabbage herb salad) for potential bonus points. Open to suggestions for what would round out the plate in a traditional and balanced way - garnish or edible.

**3) Dessert Pair: Đồ Uống Cà Phê Hỗn Hợp + Bánh ngọt** (idk how to write this)

* Apparently The requirement is to make a Vietnamese coffee cocktail and a French-influenced pastry. I haven't made a Vietnamese coffee before... Any classics or reliable approaches would help. I am leaning toward serving it warm because it'll be winter.
* For the pastry, I am considering [pandan madeleines](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/pandan-madeleine-recipe). I haven't worked with pandan before and I'm not sure if I should add a coating or glaze. Open to alternate pastry ideas that taste great with strong Vietnamese coffee.

**What I would love help with:**

* Ingredient and technique accuracy
* What is traditional vs where I can improvise
* Flavor balance
* Vietnamese spelling/word choice
* Timing tips for cooking all three in one day
* Any beginner pitfalls to watch out for

Thank you in advance. I appreciate any guidance this community is willing to share.

Yup, we're at that time of year!  Though this year, I'll be doing this in five parts like I did a couple years back when we had tons of Faceted Collection, though now it's the Everyday Luxuries collection that went wild with releases so I decided to make it Part 1 before I go into the Season releases throughout 2025.  

Yeah, the packaging for the 2025 releases did change and you can tell which ones were the old 2024 ones by the fact the text color switch going from black to white which made sense visually to me, though the fact its still in that Beveled bottle design however wasn't all that interesting to me, but the RAINBOW of colors is great!  Also lulz at Infinite Radiance being the only one with a different lid style

Anyways, shall we dive into the scents!!!!

* **Midnight Addiction** (Ripe Plum, Rich Almond Flower, Addictive Coffee Bean) - Kicking off with the first batch that came out for Spring 1, we kick off with Midnight Addiction which if I remember was supposed to be a dupe for Black Opium (AND FAIR WARNING, I don't own the originals for majority of these), if this was supposed to be it, count me in!!!  It smells dark and sexy to me and I get the fullness of the plum and the slight roundedness out of the almond flower just well, it's actually the coffee bean that I'm kind of feel like is somewhere in the background of the scent, but it's definitely not coffee-ish like Midnight Amber Glow was, it's got this nice, warm, and soft feel which made it one of my favorites this year!
* **Madame Mystique** (Bright Red Berries, Rose Petals, Sultry Woods) - Honestly, when I first smell this the first thing my brain thinks of is Dark Kiss.  For whatever reason I get this same kind of fizzy berry, but also dark and sexy tone as well here.  After a while the berries do take over on the drydown for me and it's got a nice sweetness to it that I enjoyed, but I still do prefer Dark Kiss.
* **You're Cheeky** (Pink Peppercorn, Warm Almond Flower, Vanilla Bean) - I think this scent kind of flew over my head because I couldn't remember how it smelled, but smelling it now, You're Cheeky is kind of giving me shampoo-vibe because I get the sweetness like it's a fruit or something but there isn't much in the scent notes to kind of lean me somewhere certain.  A little Robutussin-like to me...it isn't bad, but I don't think it's my kind of scent.
* **Seeing Rouge** (Blackcurrant Buds, Sweet Saffron, Amber Moss) - I think maybe the worst scent for me that came out this year might have to go to Seeing Rouge.  I know this is based off the mega popular Baccarat Rouge 540 scent, but I have never been a fan of this one.  Whenever someone gushes about it smelling sweet and beautiful...it's not coming to me because all I get is this antiseptic, animal hospital smell and it just does not work on my skin chemistry unfortunately.  Maybe I get a little warmth from the moss, but otherwise...not this was just not it, but it's just the scent of this and I assume the original (I have DUA's version of BR540 and that doesn't work on me either).
* **Loyal to You** (Sweet Lemon Blossom, Orange Flower, Vanilla Marshmallow) - With this being the Devotion dupe, Loyal to You is both a yay and a nay for me for some strange reason.  I felt like this did replace Iced Lemon Pound Cake for this year because it's supposed to be the lemon gourmand scent here.  To me, the scent doesn't quite smell gourmand to me in comparison to the aforementioned scent, but it also has this kind of weird syrupy groove that made me think of Belize Tropical Cabana (2021).  I don't know about this one anymore like...I guess in the first spray its good but the drydown isn't doing much for me.
* **Guilty as Fig** (Fig Nectar, Lush Jasmine, Creamy Musk) - I definitely forgotten the next two scents completely since there really wasn't much that came out to compare these to.  Guilty as Fig was pretty light for me and it smells nice on my skin that's for sure, but damn does it fade almost immediately for me.  I like the sweetness of the fig and the light floral coming off the jasmine which is funny that it says lush of all things.  I don't know, this was OK, but like I said, kind of forgettable in the long run for me.
* **Aqua Hour** (Watery Bergamot, Fresh Peony, Salty Driftwood) - Yeah, aquatic scents kind of was my weak point in the early year because we had a lot of aquatic scents last year as it was so Aqua Hour kind of just flew over me too.  Coming back to it for the end of the year review, it smells nice, the woodyness is what I get a lot alongside the bergamot in here.  It also has this sweet floral that makes the scent kind of give off this laundry detergent background (which is kind of funny considering the new B&BW product that came out this year).  It's fine though...way better than Mediterranean Mirage at least...
* **Viva Vanilla** (Rich Plum, Glowing Amber, Addictive Vanilla) - Yeah, they repackaged three of the 2024 Everyday Luxuries scents although one came as a mini and later on full packaging (we'll get there, I promise).  Viva Vanilla made sense since it was quite the fan favorite among them.  For me, yeah this is still great to me.  Like I still do think it smells similar to Wicked Vanilla Woods or even Ballet Nights because it's a cinnamon/vanilla-y scent that also feels gooey and candy-like.  I just love it that much, I guess!
* **Covered in Roses** (Ruby Berries, Sugared Rose Buds, Blush Amber) - Which is weird that I was surprised that this one came back.  Personally, I'm not a rose kind of guy as it as a distinct feel that I just don't vibe with (only a few seldom rose-related scents work for me).  Maybe it's the whole plant-y greenness of it that throws me off especially with the plain Rose scent and the screechy Rose Water & Ivy.  Covered in Roses does tone down those feelings, but then I'm left with a kind of planty, watery note that I don't know works for me.  Without comparing the previously mentioned scents, I couldn't tell the scent had the berries not, but I do have all three and yeah, this is sweeter by far, but this doesn't capture my interest much still.
* **All Eyes on Her** (Ripe Blackberry, Bold Jasmine, Velvety Sandalwood) - Now jumping to Spring 3, we quickly got 4 more than were released to us which were all new...maybe?  Anyways, All Eyes on Her was the one that I had not a lot of feelings towards because it's basically just Fall in Bloom, MAYBE a little sweeter with the blackberry note, but I swear they're kind of just the same otherwise to me.  Not that I disagreed with it because I kind of like this one a little more?  Yeah, maybe a bit of a double dupe like last year's If You Musk.
* **Strawberry Flirt** (Strawberry Jam, Vibrant Poppy, Cotton Candy Musk) - When I first reviewed it, I felt so confused because it smelled a LOT like All Eyes on Her which kind of disappointed me a lot.  Though with some time and working with it, it finally started to come together for me.  Like it's definitely got a stronger strawberry note to me and there's a sugary background that I don't really get out of the compared scent...I don't know how the scent changed for me, but this got better over time for me.
* **Pistachio Glaze** (Pistachio Creme, Toasted Vanilla, Sugared Patchouli) - Might personally be top 3 of my favorite scents of 2025 right here already!  Yeah, something about the pistachio scents this year (and Vacation Vibe and Sweetheart Cherry from last year) really stuck out to me and this was the crowning jewel!  It's got a strong cherry-like tone thanks to the pistachio and there's this warm nuttyness that just smelled heavenly to me.  Yeah, no...this is an awesome scent and yeah, it doesn't smell like what it's duping (Kayali's YUM! Pistachio).  
* **Imperfect Beauty** (Sweet Rhubarb, White Florals, Radiant Cashmere) - Just from some of these scent notes, I knew it kind of smelled familiar to me and it's with B&BW's 2022 scent, Poppy.  They both share kind of similar notes predominantly the rhubarb which I was surprised THAT was the key factor that me think of it.  For Imperfect Beauty, it's kind of a airy, sweet, floral scent that kind of runs a little watery/aquatic for me too.  It's fine for me though, cute scent, but a once in a while kind of scent for me.
* **Inner Angel** (Spiced Apple Cognac, Tonka Bean, Warm Praline) - Oh dang, I think Pistachio Glaze had competition to be honest.  Jumping to Fall 2, we got 4 more scents dropped starting with the one that excited me the most and Angel's Share getting a dupe is awesome since I REALLY love the apple cider scent that I get from this one.  Very apple-fronted with that spicy zip to it.  Though it does come at a cost of being a lighter scent however.  I love it though and is such a good Autumnal release!
* **Mediterranean Mirage** (Fresh Bergamot, Radiant Amber, Smooth Musks) - I think the one scent that really was a no thanks from me was Mediterranean Mirage.  While I see the scents coming close to Aqua Hour, this was anything but nice to my nose.  It's VERY sharp, the amber and musk are kind of in the way and the bergamot was more than like that citrus stab that made me wince hard at it.  Definitely comes off masculine as well to me, I don't know about it and on skin, yeah it gets slightly better after drydown, but after that point I'm just over it.  Just isn't a scent for me...
* **Free as a Flower** (Wild Orange Flower, Bright Lavender, Creamy Vetiver) - Then we have this one which is another scent I completely forgot about (especially since I reviewed this not that long ago).  I think of the 3 new ones, this fell in the middle because I loved Inner Angel and despised Mediterranean Mirage.  I also don't know how to feel about this one because it's a bright, lavender scent mostly.  I still am not quite sure what the vetiver smells like exactly, but it smells nice.  One of the few lavender scents that didn't feel like a copy and paste this year.
* **Pink Obsessed** (Blushing Jasmine, Cashmere Praline, Vanilla Bourbon) - Technically this came back in Spring 1, but as a mini-FFM in a gift set, but later fully returned in full-size with the Fall 2 releases.  Being the 3rd to return from last year, Pink Obsessed is a pretty nice, warm scent, but I couldn't tell you what I was smelling as it's both kind of floral and sweet and well-rounded enough that it could be a floral/gourmand to me.  Nice to see it return though...was one of the more memorable ones from 2024's set.
* **Infinite Radiance** (Sweet Mandarin, Opulent Muguet, Sensual Amberwood) - Then we get to the last one which was the LONE new one introduced in Winter 1!  With all of these other scents released through this, Infinite Radiance is the kind of middle-of-the-road one for me as well.  The citrus is nice, but I think I'm not too fond of the lily-of-the-valley or the woody notes really.  This was kind of just a bit dull to me especially with what we got throughout the year.  





  
======

  
Yeah, kicking off the annual posts finally and this was the year for Everyday Luxuries because overall, I think this was altogether a much better selection than the scents introduced last year.  Granted this is 16 new scents versus the 10 from last year.  Will they continue it in 2026 is curious since there isn't any hinted at for the rest of this year, but it could easily happen I would say.  ",18,1763606389.0,bathandbodyworks,2,1.0,False

Idk how to get rid of this influence? I only spend to impress/ show them off. Other times to look pretty. I can’t spend any more money like this.

1p1rkmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/VibeCodingBuilders/comments/1p1rkmw/case_study_13year_film_pro_built_a_creator/,"Case Study: 13-year film pro built a creator platform when his video host stopped listening. Used Replit + ChatGPT, 20 active users, $25/year pricing.","I talked to Kenny, a 13-year film pro who shipped a creator platform for filmmakers and content producers. Built over several months using Replit and ChatGPT while traveling in Thailand. Already has 20 active users testing and providing feedback.

His build matters for vibe coders because he's living proof that 13 years of domain expertise beats technical purity. That's why I wanted to share his story.

**His domain expertise:**

* 13 years as director of photography and video producer
* Produced content for major tech conferences and creators
* Built businesses serving clients from Vegas to Hawaii
* Experienced the industry shift as streaming changed everything
* Knew exactly what broke when platforms chased corporate accounts

For over a decade, V\*\*\*\* was the only real option for creative professionals hosting video. Then it got bloated. Features nobody asked for. Features everyone needed got ignored. Corporate accounts became the priority. Subscription renewal hit $130/year.

When I asked Kenny about the origin story, he told me he was having coffee with his wife in Chiang Mai on July 5th, dreading that renewal. He literally said: ""Why don't I try building an alternative?"" July 6th, he started building. Hasn't stopped since.

**His vibe coding approach:**

Kenny's not a traditional developer. He's built websites since age 18 using WYSIWYG builders, worked with Squarespace and Canva, but never wrote code. What struck me during our conversation was how intentional his workflow is:

* **Mockup-first workflow**: Creates all page mockups in Canva first. Then shares those mockups with ChatGPT, asking it to create a Replit prompt matching the design exactly. Only then implements in Replit. This strategy saves both time and money - something I learned from talking to him.
* **Assistant over Agent**: Most people waste money not realizing Assistant can perform the same functions as Agent, often better. Assistant has guardrails and asks for approval. Agent operates independently. Understanding this difference saved him hundreds of dollars.
* **Organized documentation**: Created a dedicated folder in ChatGPT as an evolving working document. The chat retains all questions across sessions. When things break at 11pm (and they will), he has the history to reference.

**On technical infrastructure:**

**Storage**: Currently using Replit's native Object storage with Row-Level Security, isolation buckets for users, and strong security features. Photos only for now. Plans to migrate to AWS or Supabase for video hosting in the future.

**Auth**: Already using Supabase for authentication, which will make the eventual storage migration smoother.

**Performance**: As users grow, he's focused on security, removing cache issues, and implementing lazy loading to speed up the platform.

The platform evolved beyond his initial vision. Started as a lightweight embeddable player for cloud links (Drive, Dropbox, YouTube, Instagram). Now it's a full creator profile platform with behind-the-scenes images, gear affiliate links, and customizable tabs for promoting events.

**What this shows about creative industry expertise:**

Kenny knew video hosting was broken. More importantly, he knew WHY it was broken and WHAT needed to exist instead because he lived it daily.

He understands what a filmmaker needs when hunting for that one video from three clients ago. He knows what matters when a musician wants to promote their next show while showcasing their work. He's experienced the friction of platforms built for everyone serving no one well.

When I asked him about validation, his answer was refreshingly direct: ""The build was structured based on my personal pain points."" No surveys. No market research. Deep knowledge from 13 years in the field.

This is the pattern we keep seeing with successful vibe-coded projects. The domain expertise becomes the moat. The technical implementation is learnable. But you can't fake a decade of understanding what your users actually need.

>

**Where things stand:**

* 20 active users currently
* Freemium model + $25/year paid tier
* No paying users yet (and he's okay with that)
* Still improving security, adding features, structuring next pricing tier
* Next tier will include AI chatbot for client inquiries
* Public roadmap and changelog through [featurebase.app](http://featurebase.app)
* Plans for geographic search directory to help clients find local talent

His strategy: Stay hands-on with active users. Connect with creatives. Offer free memberships in exchange for finding bugs and providing feedback. The boring reality of learn, iterate, repeat.

**On the human side:**

**Pushback**: Got it from dev friends who looked down on vibe coding. His response after 20 years as a business owner: ""People are scared of what they don't know and that's ok - it's your job to process and move on.""

**Reddit**: Very active on r/filmmakers and r/replit. His warning: ""Be prepared to have very thick skin lol.""

**First users**: Friends on Substack, Reddit, and Twitter. Stays active in Build in Public communities, offering advice and keeping up with user concerns.

**Support expectations**: ""If you're just starting out, be prepared to have zero or little support AND be ok with that - understand everyone is not as excited about your thing as you are.""

**Biggest win**: ""Learning how to build and launch my ideas within just a few months is absolutely a game changer. Learning vibe coding will create a very bright future for me alongside my existing film career.""

Reading Kenny's answers during our conversation kept me engaged for hours. This is exactly the builder spirit I keep seeing - people who turn their domain knowledge, expertise, and years of experience into products they own. With AI coding assistance, it's the perfect time to leverage yourself.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Domain depth beats technical purity**: 13 years of film experience gave Kenny insights that no amount of coding skill could replicate. He knows what creators need because he is one.
* **Workflow efficiency compounds**: His Canva → ChatGPT → Replit pipeline saves time and money. Finding efficient workflows early matters when you're building solo.
* **Assistant vs Agent distinction**: Understanding this saved hundreds of dollars. Most builders waste money on Agent when Assistant does the job better with guardrails.
* **Organized from day one**: Documentation through ChatGPT folders retains context across sessions. When things break (and they will), having that history is invaluable.
* **Build private, share public strategically**: As important as building in public is, building in private matters for sanity and prevents distraction from posting vs building.
* **Adapt or die mindset**: Kenny pivoted from photography to video to AI-assisted building. Each time the industry shifted, he learned the new thing instead of clinging to past achievements.

**Discussion:**

* For those building tools in your professional domain: how do you balance ""ship fast"" vs ""wait until you understand the problem deeply""? Kenny built on years of experience, not weeks.
* Anyone else here dealt with dev friends dismissing vibe coding? How do you handle that skepticism when you're solving real problems for real users?
* What's your take on pricing strategy for early products? Kenny's doing $25/year with no paying users yet. Too low? Just right for learning phase?

I definitely don't want to upset or offend anyone, my question is sincere: From the research I've done and the posts I read here and elsewhere, all the ""DIY"" treatments - saline, PatulEnd, etc. - are temporary measures that last as little as hours for some people. At the same time, the recommendation that one avoid/eliminate coffee, alcohol, carbonation & spicy food (if reflux is a contributor), etc., will have a tremendously negative impact on quality of life, for less-than-guaranteed, incomplete, temporary ""relief."" Lastly, there is the fact that airplane travel is not at all advised, as it is almost certain to make symptoms worse, and may even make PET more ""permanent."" With all that said, surgical procedures have a very high rate of success - ET “shim”/catheter injection (hyaluronic acid, fat, Gelfoam, etc.) allow 70-85% of people to return to unrestricted flying. The results ""only"" last 6-24 months, but it is repeatable. Permanent reconstruction (fat graft + cartilage, myringotomy with plugging, cauterisation, etc.), allows 90%+ of people to fly without restrictions afterward, and is a ""one and done"" procedure for the vast majority. So my question is, why do so many people seem to be suffering and trying to make this a little bit better with convoluted, temporary measures, when there are procedures available that are very likely to provide a significant, if not complete and permanent, end to their symptoms?",1,1763605500.0,PatulousTubes,4,0.6,False

Nothing spectacular, but a good variety that will satisfy the average person. At the very least, it gives you something to leaf through while your friends talk instead of fidgeting with your phone. 

The place is not very big, but they managed to fit in a few tables and a couch area. The walls are pretty bare and it's clear the place was designed to be moved around to easily accommodate large social gatherings. 

I was only there for coffee but by the time I left people were streaming in for lunch so the food must be decent. I'm still perplexed about the photocopy machine in the corner though (if you know, you know).

You have big dreams for the next 5–10 years… but *what’s the next move*? And how do you keep all those long-term goals straight when life is throwing distraction, debt, and dopamine traps at you from every direction?

That’s exactly why we built **ClarityGoals – The Long-Term Goal Tracker.**  
 Not another “habit app.” Not another bloated project tool. A simple overview that lets you:

* Map out your **10-year and 5-year goals**  
* Reverse-engineer them into **1-year, quarter, and month** milestones  
* Visually see your whole path on one clean board  
* Mark goals as *Achieved* and actually feel your progress stacking up  

Most people never write their goals down or track them consistently… and the data shows this kind of tracking can make you **about 9–10x more likely** to actually hit your goals vs the average person.

ClarityGoals is available **now as a web app** on all modern browsers. iOS and Android apps are coming early 2026.

And we priced it so money isn’t an issue:  
 ☕️ Roughly the price of *one* coffee drink per month  
 💵 **$1 for your first month**, then **$6/month**, no yearly lock-in, cancel anytime

If you’re tired of drifting and you’re ready to **design a life that actually feels like yours**, this is your tool.

I had a job. I paid my bills. I watched Netflix, scrolled TikTok, replied to messages, repeated. If you’d seen me, you’d probably think, “They’re doing okay.” But inside, I felt drained and strangely hollow, like I was drifting through my own life on autopilot.

What scared me wasn’t just the tiredness. It was the feeling that something vital in me had gone quiet. My intuition felt muted. Life felt flat. I wasn’t depressed enough to “break,” but I wasn’t truly alive either. I went to bed most nights staring at the ceiling, wondering why I felt so disconnected.

During one of those late-night searches about feeling “switched off,” I kept seeing the same phrase: [the pineal gland](https://healmindandbody.my.canva.site/dag4r-awuby), often called the “third eye.” At first, I dismissed it. It sounded too mystical, too New Age. I scrolled past the videos and articles and went back to my usual coping mechanism: distractions.

But the phrase kept showing up. Posts. Videos. Articles. People talking about sleep, dreams, intuition, and something inside them “waking up” again. It reached a point where I thought, *Okay, universe, I get it. I’ll at least read one article.*

That was the night I fell down the rabbit hole.

I learned that the pineal gland is a tiny pine-cone-shaped gland deep in the brain, linked to melatonin production, sleep-wake cycles, and what many spiritual traditions call our “inner eye.” Some call it the gateway to intuition and inner guidance; others stick to the biology and talk about circadian rhythm and night-time restoration. Both sides had something in common: when this little gland is stressed or “dull,” life often feels that way too.

Then came the punch in the gut: modern life is basically a pineal gland’s worst nightmare. Constant blue light from screens, late nights, stress, processed food, stimulants, and never really resting. It didn’t feel like I was reading an article — it felt like I was reading my daily routine.

As I read more, I started seeing stories from people who tried supporting their pineal gland with specific supplements and simple rituals. Some mentioned deeper sleep, vivid dreams, and a stronger sense of inner clarity. Others shared their personal pineal xt review and how a targeted formula helped them feel more “online” mentally and spiritually. I wasn’t interested in hype or miracles. I was interested in one honest question:

*What would happen if I actually supported this part of my brain for 30 days and paid attention?*

So I turned it into an experiment.

Every night, about 30 minutes before bed, I took a supplement designed to support pineal gland and brain health. No harsh stimulants, just a blend of botanicals and nutrients that lined up with what I’d been reading. I didn’t obsess over every ingredient; I just chose a formula that felt aligned and decided to be consistent.

I paired it with a tiny ritual. Lights dimmed. Phone in another room. I sat on my bed, placed a hand on my chest, and took ten slow breaths. With each exhale, I repeated in my mind: *“Tonight, I choose calm and clarity. I allow my mind to soften. I’m open to inner guidance.”* It took maybe three minutes. No chanting, no incense, no elaborate setup.

In the mornings, before touching my phone, I sat quietly for three to five minutes. I asked myself one simple question: *“What do I need today?”* Some days nothing clear came. Other days, a single word floated up: rest, focus, boundaries, honesty. I didn’t force it. I just listened.

The first week was subtle. I wasn’t getting any cosmic downloads. The main change was that I felt a little sleepier at night in a natural way. I fell asleep slightly faster and woke up a bit less wrecked. Old me would’ve said, “Meh, nothing’s happening,” and quit. This time, I reminded myself: this is a 30-day experiment, not a 3-day miracle.

During the second week, the small changes started stacking. My sleep felt deeper, and my dreams became more vivid and memorable. I woke up a little lighter instead of dragging myself out of bed. One morning, I woke up before my alarm, not in a panic, just calm and awake. It was such a small moment, but it felt foreign in the best way.

By the third week, I noticed a shift that had nothing to do with sleep. My mental noise had turned down a notch. Conversations felt less like something I had to “push through.” I wasn’t diving into my phone every spare second. I caught myself actually noticing sunlight on the wall, the taste of my coffee, the feel of my feet on the floor.

Then came the moment that really shook me.

I’d been stuck for months on a decision: a project that looked great on paper but felt “off” in my gut. Normally I would overthink it into oblivion — lists, pros and cons, asking everyone for advice. One morning, during my quiet check-in, a thought came through so clearly it almost startled me: *“You already know the answer. You just don’t want to disappoint anyone.”*

It was like my inner voice had finally cut through the static.

I realized my true answer was no. It didn’t matter how good it looked externally; my body tightened every time I considered saying yes. For the first time in a long time, I trusted that feeling. I turned the project down — and instead of spiraling into regret, I felt an unexpected calm. A quiet certainty. Like I’d just aligned with something truer inside me.

By the end of 30 days, nothing in my external life had dramatically changed. Same job. Same city. Same responsibilities. But my internal experience of that life was different. My nights were less of a fight. My sleep was deeper. I felt like a fog had lifted from my mind. My intuition wasn’t suddenly magical or dramatic; it was simply clearer, like a radio station finally tuned in.

Do I think a supplement alone changed my life? No. What changed my life was the combination: targeted support for my brain and pineal gland, a tiny commitment to ritual, and a willingness to listen inward again. The formula helped my body feel safe enough to relax. The rituals gave my mind space to breathe. Together, they made it easier for my inner voice to be heard.

Maybe that’s why so many people feel compelled to write their own stories and pineal xt review posts. When you’ve been living in mental fog for years, even a gentle shift feels revolutionary.

If you recognize parts of yourself in this — the exhaustion, the numbness, the sense that your inner “spark” has gone dim — consider running your own experiment. It doesn’t have to look exactly like mine. It can be your own version of nightly support, small rituals, and honest listening.

If you’re curious about the science and the specific formula that inspired my 30 days, you’ll find the same presentation I watched linked below. Watch it, feel into your own body’s response, and decide for yourself.

Thirty days from now, you could still be scrolling at 2 a.m., wondering why you feel so disconnected. Or you could look back, like I did, and quietly realize: *that* was the month everything inside you started to wake up.

1p1ra5p,https://i.redd.it/q9f36rirnb2g1.jpeg,Actors Access casting legit or a scam? (lemon light),"Hey everyone, I’m hoping someone here can help me figure out whether a booking I just received is legit.

I submitted to a project on Actors Access. Shortly after, I got an email from:

[grace.nelson@lemonlight.com](mailto:grace.nelson@lemonlight.com)

The email said I was booked for a role (“Min’s Friend”) on something they called Amazon CPF, shooting in the Bay Area. The rate was $150 for the first 5 hours + $30/hr for additional hours. They immediately sent onboarding documents and a talent release without actually confirming my booking or giving me a call sheet.

What’s weird:

• The voicemail they left refers to it as a “Sustainable Living Project,” not Amazon.

• They never explicitly said “You’re booked” — they just sent documents.

• They haven’t provided a shoot address, call time, or anything normal for confirming a job.

• The phone number they called me from is +1 (801) 558-1788 (Utah area code??), even though this is supposed to be a Northern California shoot.

• I can’t verify that this phone number belongs to Lemonlight.

• Their communication feels a little sloppy and rushed.

I know Lemonlight is a real production company and that Grace Nelson is supposedly an actual production coordinator there, but the mismatched project name, missing call sheet, and Utah number have me feeling pretty suspicious.

Has anyone worked with Lemonlight recently or booked through them via Actors Access? Is this normal for them? Has anyone received something similar?

Any advice or insight would be super appreciated before I sign anything. 🙏



The email they sent me said: 

Hello!

  
We are happy to offer you the role on Amazon CPF Details listed below. 

Project: Amazon, CPF

Role: Min's Friend

Date: Friday 11/21

City: NorCal Bay Area

Rate: $150 for the first five hours +30 for every additional hour.



Please be sure to complete the next two steps within 48 hours to ensure your payment is delivered on time.



1. Complete our onboarding documents 
2. Sign your Talent Release You’ll need the project info listed above.



After these steps are completed, and your shoot is wrapped, you will receive an email to set up an account through our Tipalti portal for payroll - this email will come directly from Tipalti, not Lemonlight. After receiving the email, please create an account and add all pertinent information to ensure timely payment. Check your spam folder if you do not receive an email 5 business days after the shoot. Please keep in mind we are on a Net30 payment cycle.

I’ll be in touch with the call sheet, storyboard, and any additional information necessary in the coming days.
