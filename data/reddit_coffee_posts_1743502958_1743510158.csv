They are in the early undiagnosed stage.  I am assuming that they are in the early stages because of the overwhelming changes I am seeing in both of them,  and from input from this forum.   They refuse to go to a doctor,  so I'm using my best judgement.  

In the past we used to have favorite things to do together like going out for coffee,  visiting stores etc.  We used to do them on a regular basis.  Now,  it seems that I can't get a ""routine"" activity to stick anymore.  All the things we used to do we only do them if I  initiate it.  They no longer call me in advance to make plans for these routine activities. If we discover a new coffee place,  and everyone seems to agree we need to go again,  my dad and step mom don't ask to go again.  They are happy to go,  however,  if I arrange it.  I'm a bit sad,  because I feel that that part of our relationship has deteriorated and could possibly mean more changes to come.  Has anyone else experienced this in the early stages?

1jou5xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Correct-Mess1047/comments/1jou5xv/relationship_advise/,Relationship Advise,"I, 29 male, and my husband, 28 male. We have been together for 5 years and married for 2 years. I'm starting to have a feeling that this relationship is draining me both physically and emotionally. Please be straightforward and honest with me, if I'm being crazy or he is driving me crazy?

A little information here, I‚Äôm the main provider to our household, constantly working long hours, its almost 12 hours since the minute I woke up till the time I get home. On the other hand, he mostly works from home, 8 hours and he is done. And in the past three years, he quit his job once and got laid off twice. So, he spent a lot of time home being ‚Äúbusy‚Äù. When I get home from work, there are always dishes on the coffee table or in the sink. Since I also cook dinner for us, I have to clean the dirty pot and dishes first before I can start to cook.

The problem is when I ask him to do something around the house whether he is working or just chilling at home, he will forget 2 out of 3 things. I have to constantly chase him, ‚Äúhey remember you said you are going to do this; did you do this yet?‚Äù This created tension between us, he got annoyed and often said if it bothers you this much, why don't you get it done. Then I got frustrated, I stopped asking him to do stuff, but I built up huge resentment towards him. Keep in mind, I wasn‚Äôt asking for the moon, I asked him to put away his dishes after he ate lunch while watching TV, or please put away the Christmas tree since it‚Äôs February already. It wasn‚Äôt until mid-March he finally did it after we had a huge fight about it. Same thing with dishes, we had so many fights about it. Did it work? Yes. But the problem is in his mind, I‚Äôm the villain in every situation. He told me that every time he saw the dishes on the coffee table, he started to panic, because he knew I would be pissed if I saw that after I got home. He is constantly worried about me getting mad. I would say something like then just put away the dishes when you are done, then you don‚Äôt have to stress about it, and I don‚Äôt have to get mad about it. He would accuse me of being insensitive and wanted me to apologize to him. I feel like he is baiting me, so I would be the villain. For example, it shouldn‚Äôt take a month to put away the Christmas tree, or it shouldn‚Äôt take 3 weeks to put away the extension cord that he used and left on the dining room table. I remined him once, nothing. Twice, nothing. Three times, nothing. Until I get mad and fight him about it, he gets it done. but says to me ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you say it nicely, why you have to so mean about it.‚Äù Then he wants me to apologize for being mean or lash out. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in this dead-end circle. No matter what I do, I‚Äôm always wrong. I know people might say ‚Äúif you know you guys would fight about it, why don‚Äôt you get it done then?‚Äù I feel like I‚Äôm doing enough, I make twice as much as him, so I cover most of our joint expenses, I cook, I clean, and I do the laundry for both of us. I feel like asking him to clean up after himself isn‚Äôt too much to ask for.

And other small things like taking a 30-minute-long shower in the morning while I‚Äôm still sleeping. I told him many times, you are not just waking me up, you are keeping me up the entire time while you shower. Keep in mind that we are 3 bathrooms. He could just take a shower in the other bathroom. But no, he still does that every day until I get mad and fight him about it. He said why can‚Äôt I shower where I want? Why are you so bossy? I seriously don‚Äôt know if he just got get it or just simply baiting me.

¬†

Guys, am I crazy? I feel like I‚Äôm going to snap. I feel like his mom, and I hate that about me. But I just don‚Äôt know what to do.",1,1743509916.0,u_Correct-Mess1047,0,1.0,False

1jou4q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1jou4q5/rao_guidelines_evaluating_natural_versus_washed/,Rao Guidelines: Evaluating Natural versus Washed and Heat versus Moisture,"Hello! I fell in love with *The Coffee Roaster's Companion* by Scott Rao when I first came across it. By recommendations in this sub, I believe :)

I'm just a home roaster; after years of popcorn machines I finally graduated to the SR800. In a mix-up with the roaster I buy beans from, I wound up with a big lot of natural processed beans and had to ""jump in"" roasting them before I was ready. The coffee gods smiled up this, apparently, because I'm drinking the first of it now and it's sublime... anyway!

I have the same Rwandan varietal (same farms, same washing stations, same trading company) in two processed forms: Washed and Natural. I think the washed ferments for not longer than 36 hours, then is fully depulped and dried. Moisture content is 11%. The natural sits in the sun for 20-25 days, then is depulped, washed (no ferment) and dried. Moisture content 11.5%

I've been roasting both for more than a year, but this was my first go of the natural on the SR800. (I'd done a couple of the washed already). My roast goal is always ""city"" (end of first crack - personal taste preference).

Rao's **general** guidlines say a bean with higher moisture content can take a higher charge temperature well (and a higher charge temp = higher outer/inner delta T, conducive for better development on light roasts).

My question: experience has taught me this particular natural processed bean is MUCH better when charged at a LOWER temp than it's washed cousin. I take both to city roast, but the natural comes out best with a lower temp, longer roast. If I ""push it"" (say I roast the natural exactly the same as the washed), then all the lovely raspberries and dark chocolate notes disappear. The washed version of this bean just doesn't have those exotic flavors/aromas (although it's very good) no matter how I've permuted my roasting.

Is there a structural difference (e.g. tough cellulose matrix, density?) or something else in the natural that makes it benefit from a cooler, slower roast than it's **drier** cousin?

If you‚Äôre up for a friendly chat, let‚Äôs see where it goes. No pressure, just good vibes and interesting conversations. Drop me a message if you‚Äôre interested.

I think you get the idea. In all these instances, the ""someone"" is me. I don't know why he doesn't use the word ""you"" instead.

**Chapter Sixty Nine: One for the Isaac-Raksim Shippers**¬†

**Memory Transcription Subject: Lieutenant Isaac Yankovic**

Date \[standardized human time\]: Aprilvember 38th, 2136

An invigorating morning chill grazed my skin as I walked along the well-worn paths of Fort Devens‚Äô dormitory and barracks section. A soft breeze sent leaves fluttering and tumbling across the sidewalk. Much to me and Raksim‚Äôs amusement, several privates desperately chased after them. A squad from another platoon had gotten themselves into trouble, and their sergeant‚Äôs chosen punishment was making them do yard work first thing in the morning with their bare hands.

I took comfort in the fact that my soldiers‚Äìdespite how much they troubled me‚Äìhad never behaved in a manner warranting such severe disciplinary action. And even if they did, the pressing timeline we were on meant that I couldn‚Äôt punish them with anything other than additional training. Said time constraints would also explain why I could already hear drill sergeants shouting from inside the dormitory building.

I walked as quickly as I could toward the noise, but the coffee I held in my hand hampered me. Every time I wanted to take a sip of the stimulant, I had to halt in my tracks to do so, in accordance with army regulations.

Every time I stopped, Raksim‚Äôs feathers raised slightly‚Äìmore and more until his hackles were bristling, and he made the extremely annoying decision to speak.

‚ÄúWhy do you insist on following your military‚Äôs most asinine rules?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't want to get fired or disciplined by Rainach,‚Äù I answered.

For a few merciful moments, the krakotl was silent. Unfortunately, he chose to open his beak again. ‚ÄúWhen I was an exterminator, I simply ignored nonsensical regulations.‚Äù

A sigh escaped from deep within my being. ‚Äú*You* existed in a quasi-legal organization, with little oversight, that you were partially in charge of. *I‚Äôm* just a Lieutenant; I can‚Äôt get away with as much as you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll break into a warehouse, steal an entire platoon‚Äôs worth of weapons, and assault your own soldiers, but you won‚Äôt walk and drink at the same time?‚Äù¬†

I stopped in front of the dorm building‚Äôs doors and took an extra long, slurping sip of my coffee just to annoy him. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

I entered the dorm, not waiting for Raksim‚Äôs response. Inside, I found the usual morning chaos. Drill sergeants were relentlessly pounding on doors and screaming to rouse the soldiers on the other side from their sleep. Luckily, most of the men had already lined up in the hallway, rubbing their eyes and tiredly standing at attention.¬†

In a rare occurrence, the most sleep-deprived person wasn‚Äôt among the enlisted. Lieutenant Huang‚Äìwith a slouching posture and heavy bags under eyes‚Äìwaited just inside the entrance with Lieutenant Jackson by her side.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I said to both of them.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so fucking great about it?‚Äù Huang croaked.

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThose idiots outside are mine. They stole food from the chow hall.‚Äù

I blinked several times in astonishment. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

The coffee in my hand caught her eye. She glanced between me and the cup several times before slowly extricating it from my hand and taking it for herself. ‚ÄúTo have a party in their room. Like I said, they‚Äôre idiots,‚Äù she said sneeringly.

I shrugged and let her have the coffee. She seemed like she needed it more than me anyways.

Not a moment later, Raksim burst through the doors with his feathers raised. ‚ÄúYou are infuriating! One moment you‚Äôre ignoring regulations and the next you‚Äôre contorting yourself to follow them! Make it make sense! For my own sanity!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple, old man; I don‚Äôt like pushing my luck.‚Äù

The krakotl‚Äôs plumage didn‚Äôt get any lower. ‚ÄúBut you do! That‚Äôs why you broke into that warehouse in the first place!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt was a necessary risk to get my soldiers weapons; walking and drinking are not.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, would you two just fuck already?‚Äù Huang interjected. ‚ÄúYou two already argue like you‚Äôve been married for thirty years.‚Äù

Blood rushed to my face. Not just because of the nature of her comment, but the embarrassment of arguing with a colleague in front of my fellow officers. ‚ÄúFirst of all, I‚Äôd like to establish that the only thing I‚Äôd fuck him with is a hot poker,‚Äù I said while gesturing to my advisor.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Raksim added, ‚Äúwe have a mutual hatred of each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúSecondly, I‚Äôm not a xenophile.‚Äù

Huang smirked and raised an eyebrow alongside Jackson. ‚ÄúThou dost protest too much.‚Äù

‚Äú*Thiiigh hiiighs‚Ä¶*‚Äù Jackson whispered like he was casting an archaic spell.

I huffed and turned my attention away from them. ‚ÄúFuck both of you.‚Äù

The drill sergeants, having woken up and accounted for everyone, hurried the men outside for morning PT. I fell in with them, not paying any mind to the snickering coming from the other lieutenants.

I stood to the side while the sergeants arranged their soldiers into groups and columns based on what units they were in.

Tiel and Nedelin exited the dorms together at the very rear of the group. When the venlil noticed me, he seemed to quickly switch his gaze from the Platoon Sergeant‚Äôs face to straight ahead. Though, it was hard to tell exactly where a venlil was looking in the first place, on account of their monocular eye placement.

In my peripheral vision, I noticed Raksim regarding the pair with equal parts contempt and suspicion.

Nedelin briefly glanced at the krakotl before a mischievous smile spread across his face. He grabbed his venlil companion by the PT shirt and planted a passionate kiss on his lips. Just to add to the display‚Äôs luridness, he crept his hands down Tiel‚Äôs back until they came to rest on his butt, all while making eye contact with Raksim. When he finished, he pushed the orange-faced venlil away to find his spot for morning PT.

Raksim turned an eye to me. ‚ÄúYou cannot tell me that you didn‚Äôt see that!‚Äù

I shrugged uncaringly.

‚ÄúIs there some unseen influence that keeps you from noticing that they‚Äôre a couple?!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLooks like they‚Äôre just good friends to me.‚Äù

He looked at me in complete disbelief. ‚ÄúHas your brain fallen out of your head?‚Äù

A vision of me ripping Raksim‚Äôs heart out of his chest and crushing it between my teeth suddenly played out in my head. ‚ÄúYou know what? *Fuck you.* I don‚Äôt have to put up with this shit. As soon as possible, I‚Äôm putting in a request for your transfer to a different unit.‚Äù

The krakotl‚Äôs feathers rose. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt dare.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think I won‚Äôt?‚Äù I said with calm, calculated malice. ‚ÄúWatch me.‚Äù I turned and began walking to the administration building.¬†

At first, Raksim didn‚Äôt follow me, and I enjoyed a few lovely minutes alone. However, halfway through the walk, he swooped down next to me, landing with his claws scraping against the pavement.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking you to reconsider.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt feel like it,‚Äù I said without hesitation.

‚ÄúYou need my help to train your soldiers. No one else has the experience training the variety of species that I do.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have a point, but I‚Äôm fed up with you.‚Äù

As I drew closer to the administration building, Raksim became more desperate. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre putting a personal grudge before the needs of your men! Think about this!‚Äù

‚ÄúI already did,‚Äù I said coolly.

Raksim ceased speaking as I entered the administration building. He followed closely as we maneuvered through cubicle spaces, around personnel, and into a hallway with enclosed office rooms on either side.

I couldn‚Äôt help but find amusement in my *former* advisor‚Äôs sour expression. ‚ÄúIf you were this quiet all the time, I might have considered keeping you around,‚Äù I said snidely.

Raksim hissed and jumped into the air, kicking and slashing at me with his talons.

I guarded my face and retreated into one of the office rooms, but the krakotl relentlessly pressed on.¬†

With no other options, I fought through the flurry of claws and feathers, managing to seize him by the neck. I slammed him into the desk several times, scattering papers and office supplies everywhere.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with you?!‚Äù I growled.

He spoke despite the hand I pressed down on his throat. ‚ÄúYou are *not* transferring me to a different unit!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIs this supposed to convince me not to?‚Äù

A shrewd expression settled on Raksim‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúVery well. If I can‚Äôt convince you to keep me around for your soldiers‚Äô benefit, perhaps I can appeal to you with more *personal* benefits.‚Äù He opened his legs and positioned himself in a way that invited me closer.

My eyes briefly wandered downward before I stopped them. ‚ÄúThis is very unusual behavior for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the head trauma,‚Äù he said quickly, his eyes rolling in two different directions

‚ÄúThat makes sense.‚Äù

He hooked a claw around my collar and pulled me closer. ‚ÄúEnough talk,‚Äù he whispered, ‚Äúclose the door and *take me.*‚Äù

Date \[standardized human time\]: Aprilvember 38th, 2136

Morning PT had concluded, and Lieutenant Yankovic was still missing. The first place Alek looked for him was Captain Andrew‚Äôs office in the administration building. He found no trace of him. In fact, the Captain hadn‚Äôt seen him all morning. He called upon the other sergeants to assist with the search, but they too were unable to find him. With no other choice, Alek organized the entire platoon into pairs and dispatched them to search every conceivable place Yankovic could be hiding.

While the two-man teams spread out in every direction, I decided to be a little more clever. Vil and I went straight to the administration building‚Äìthe place where he was most likely to be in the first place. However, instead of taking the main walkway, we went down a narrow side route that provided a much more direct route to where I assumed the Captain‚Äôs office was. Unfortunately, that decision made us the ones who found him. And after hearing what was going on in that office, neither of us was going to open it ourselves.

‚ÄúAre you sure it is him?‚Äù Alek asked me.

As if on cue, Yankovic‚Äôs voice resonated into the hallway. ‚ÄúWatch the claws, you fucking maniac!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fairly confident,‚Äù I answered.

Alek turned to Captain Andrews and politely gestured for her to proceed.

She glared at him with disapproval for passing on the responsibility. Nonetheless, she sighed with exasperation and knocked on the door.

The commotion inside the room ceased immediately. A blend of profanities and struggling noises filled the air before Yankovic threw the door open, slamming it against the adjacent wall. He briskly walked out of the office, zipping up his pants as he did, and didn‚Äôt acknowledge or make eye contact with anyone.¬†

Not long after, Raksim appeared, limping but wearing a cheerful expression and a distant look in his eyes.

Alek turned to Andrews with a smirk. ‚ÄúI told you he likes aliens.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe made them wear thigh-highs. It‚Äôs not surprising,‚Äù she replied.

Yankovic suddenly reversed course, bearing down on the Captain with terrifying speed. ‚Äú*I* wasn‚Äôt the one who designed the uniforms!‚Äù He loomed over her and pointed a finger at Alek. ‚ÄúIt was him! Not me!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou still boinked an alien,‚Äù she said with a smirk.

Yankovic sighed, turned to Alek, and kneed him in the testicles.

‚ÄúDoes anybody else want to argue about this?‚Äù he said as the Platoon Sergeant rolled on the floor in pain.

Andrews held her hands up in surrender. Vil and I followed suit.¬†

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he said as he left.¬†

Everyone‚Äìexcept Alek‚Äìstood in awkward silence for a moment until curiosity overcame us. We turned slightly to look inside the office. Not a single piece of furniture was upright or unbroken. The desk, which to my eye looked to be made of an antique hardwood, was completely broken in half and had several tracks of deep claw marks in its surface.

‚ÄúI wish he‚Äôd do that to me,‚Äù Vil whispered to herself.

My head snapped to her. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

1jotwsl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jotwsl,"When 127 Javanese were sent to The World's Fair 1893 in Chicago, USA.","The Silver State. March 28 ,1893.


BOUND FOR CHICAGO.  


A Trainload of Javanese En Route for the World‚Äôs Fair.  


A special train consisting of 26 freight cars and five sleepers rolled into Winnemucca yesterday afternoon, where nearly all the people in town had been patiently waiting for some time to get a glimpse of the Javanese men and women who lately arrived in San Francisco and were due here on their way to the World‚Äôs fair.  


Dusky faces soon appeared at the windows, wondering what had caused the commotion. Framed in turbans, their oriental character was distinctly marked and dissimilar to either the Chinese or Japanese. The women as a rule were far better looking than those of either of these races, and the men wore the fiercer and more restless expression characteristic of the Malay race.  


A Silver State reporter soon found Mr. Mundt, the wealthy Java planter under whose auspices the company is journeying. He was affable and gentlemanly, and willing to impart all desired information. He complained however, that although they had passed three days in San Francisco, his people had not been allowed to leave the steamer on which they arrived, as they were anxious to do, in order to see the city. Mr. Mundt and a number of others of the party are Europeans who own plantations in Java, and he himself has over 5000 acres in tea and coffee, besides several thousand in sugar.  


He employs on his plantation 900 men and 1500 women, who are natives, and the latter are employed picking tea and coffee. These three staples and cinchona are the principle productions of the island. He informed the reporter that last year about 1,500,000 sacks of coffee were produced, of which, perhaps, the larger part came to the United States. The sugar output is about 100,000 tons. Shortly after the British government started the cultivation of the cinchona tree in India, Mr. Mundt and others planted it in Java, where it has done well.  



There are 127 persons in the party, 36 being native women and girls, and most of the rest are native men‚ÄîJavanese and Sundanese, from the island of Sunda. The reporter was informed that while in San Francisco so many persons came on board the steamer to see them that the women, not knowing the reason for the crowds, became alarmed and clung to Mr. Mundt for protection, and he had difficulty in allaying their fears.  



The cars contain altogether 1100 tons of freight belonging to them, the purpose being to set up a miniature Javanese village at the World‚Äôs fair, where the men and women will carry on their usual avocations, just as at home. Tropical plants will be sent on to them from San Francisco to help carry out the illusion, and the women will weave their cloths, nets, baskets, etc., in the space allotted to them, which is 100,000 square feet.  



The natives always carry with them their sacred birds, which are supposed to ward off sickness and all manner of evil, but out of nearly sixty birds all but two succumbed to the unusually cold weather encountered during the voyage. The natives themselves are very sensitive to the cold, and the cars in which they are traveling would have served very well for Turkish bathrooms.  



Both men and women are inveterate smokers of a peculiar cigarette, the wrapper being a strip of palm leaf. They presented a great number of these cigarettes to different ones in the crowd who asked for them.  



One of the party, learning the reporter‚Äôs mission, invited him to go to the baggage car and see an orang-outang, which they are taking with them. The Darwinian pet was found in a rather sulky mood, and refused to be interviewed. He does not (so the man said) like the motion of the cars, and has not yet recovered his temper after the teasing to which he was subjected on shipboard while at San Francisco. Finally the creature condescended to accept a couple of bananas, the first food he had taken for two days. He is a powerful-looking fellow, standing about five feet four inches high. Being only four years old, he has not yet, of course, got his growth.  


Two funny little Javanese dogs were also in the car, looking more like bear cubs than dogs.  


At 2:30 P.M. the train pulled out and will probably reach Chicago on Thursday. Mr. Mundt has with him a quantity of coffee, tea and sugar from his plantation for exhibition at the exposition.

First pitch is at 9:40 PM ET, which means by the time it‚Äôs over, most of us will be asleep, or wide awake overanalyzing a one-run loss. Either way, it‚Äôs a guaranteed next-day coffee emergency.

Now, I had a post about this game earlier, but the mods took it down. Which, honestly, makes sense. Nothing in baseball ever happens without at least one confusing call. No replay review, no explanation‚Äîjust me standing here like a Tigers baserunner who thought he was safe, only to realize the umpire had other plans.

Tonight, Casey Mize takes the mound for Detroit, which is exciting because it‚Äôs been forever since we‚Äôve seen him fully healthy. Mize was the first overall pick in 2018, so naturally, we have spent the last six years expecting him to turn into the second coming of Verlander. And now, after all the injuries, rehab, and waiting, he‚Äôs back‚Äîwhich means we will definitely judge his entire future based on what happens in the first inning.

Seattle is sending out Logan Gilbert, who is tall, throws hard, and generally makes hitters look foolish. So, you know, exactly the kind of guy we love to face. The Tigers‚Äô best hope here is that Gilbert forgets how to throw strikes for just long enough to make things interesting.

Offensively, Spencer Torkelson already homered this season, which means we now fully expect him to do that every game. Riley Greene is raking, Kerry Carpenter is heating up, and if Javier B√°ez wants to surprise us all by not swinging at a slider in the dirt, that would be a welcome plot twist.

So, here we go. Tigers vs. Mariners. A battle of young arms, a test of our ability to stay awake, and a game that will definitely give us something to irrationally overreact to by morning.",0,1743509015.0,motorcitykitties,2,0.33,False

**IC & Yivea & Rai:** OH SHIIIIIIEEEEEEEEET!

# What is up, my cute and funny lovers~ This is the r/SenseisKitchen Moderation Team. 

*I hope your brain has healed, because we‚Äôre gonna destroy it again today with my comically large hammer.*

We‚Äôre here today for a very special reason (it‚Äôs not Dorontabi-sama revival arc however, else this subreddit will become a church for him). But first, I have to roll the obligatory flashback:

You see, it has been a year since our subreddit was officially online, and it was a year that I will hardly forget‚Ä¶ mostly from the sheer amount of n-words that have been thrown in our basement. We can hardly imagine that it‚Äôll stay up for a week in this fair and unbiased place named Reddit, let alone a full 1 and a third pregnancy period. For the first time without feeling like Shinji's post-nut clarity, we decided to finally reheat the kitchen to prepare for this special occasion, hoping to cook something very special to celebrate this milestone. What we didn‚Äôt expect however, was some of the members acting a bit suspicious, causing a totally normal kitchen operation to become a month-long Among Us playthrough.¬†

[yes I know this is just a fucking screenshot but give me a break, i got an hour to edit pics with no Ps skill here üò≠üò≠](https://preview.redd.it/29mwtbkfi7se1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eadfca26364878e18111133e8a963de7c7e9974)

The Impostors successfully steal one of the unfinished recipes, then vent out of the kitchen and rebrand themselves with a brand new restaurant, hoping to win the game via framing the crewmates. Sadly, their plan didn‚Äôt turn out to be successful, as the venting was caught on camera by u/WickedAcad, and all impostors were eventually ejected. As a last ditch effort so drag our rating down, Ohansa bin Raden from DynamisOne decided 9/11 was just a bit too generous, so motherfucker tatical Reisa nuke the entire restaurant, causing all customers and the Mod Team with servere skibidi brainrot.

[Live Leak: Acad shaving Reisa's pubic hair](https://preview.redd.it/7mpyz8y1h7se1.jpg?width=995&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5ceccdb98add3def3a601f0c44945a6a04b382c)

Fresh off from the lobotomy hospital after a brain aneurysm surgery in Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs basement (he‚Äôs trying to appeal to his heart attack patients with Gen Alpha‚Äôs language), we found ourselves sharing space with very ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù and ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù patients who happened to catch a dangerous disease called ‚ÄúRetardation A.P.E‚Äù. You can imagine exactly how that went:

[I-I-uhhh-I-huhhhhh-I \*laugh\* I don‚Äôt think they like us so much \*joy\*](https://preview.redd.it/rhyzjn45l7se1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=d77a35c2573759dbbe185c5ddc51701919780b69)

That‚Äôs right ladies and gentlemen, the entire facility was just a disguise for the Backrooms, also known as Twitter, home of some unimaginable creatures such as: Trans Soy Wojak, Earth Update‚Äôs admin server, ChibiReviewer haters, and how can I forget the poor people begging money by saying lolicons are \[*Reddit* *Admins profanities*\]. Together, they formed the Four Pillars of ~~Apocalypses~~ Schizophrenia, hoping to wipe out normies from the face of the Earth and replace them with ""modern"" people who share their ideology through posting on Twitter (they burn half of their daily energy to do that, skill issue).

[Said people when I tell them literally anything logical \(They have 536GB of CP in their server to harass you\)](https://preview.redd.it/lydznbhvj7se1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa22d6239fe7f0a6360a39233435e3953a2d816e)

As a result, our survival instinct kicked in faster than Americans during a gold rush, forcing us to do our best Solid Snake impression for a 40% chance of escaping Elon Musk‚Äôs prison, all while hoping not to be captured to hear their ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù and ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù opinions. Luckily for us, with knowledge gathered from violence on movies and sex on TV, using the good old fashioned values upon which we used to rely, ~~a fucking hammer and one big N-word to every single people there, hard R of course :besitos:~~, we traverse through Ubisoft‚Äôs office as easy as @MenLover turned gay (Hi Abood :D), hacking and slashing every single \[*Reddit* *Admins profanities*\] and running through them with a four people Mustang until they handled themselves to the police for using banned method of canceling each other - CP harassment. Just like that, we were able to destroy the SCP Foundation along with all of the horror beyond human comprehension and free ourselves from the cringe training facility, before getting sucked away by fUckInG SPaCe

[Alright, I need to seek drug testing after writing this entire script, because what the fuck am I on rn \*rofl\*](https://preview.redd.it/6bm4vasvg7se1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2fb1c54f29537279e21beed7e9dc7f9e9855b5e7)

Look, all I‚Äôm trying to say is, we were in one weird episode of The Big Bang Theory when it was directed by fucking Cocomelon, but that‚Äôs okay. Sometimes you need a little brainrot to get in touch with your inner child, preferably with a generous amount of fresh cunny fluids to get the synapses up and running (I will refill them back with my condensed baby milk üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠)

Frfr though, seeing our community grow in the past year, with so many unforgettable events and memories, plenty of drama and hardship we faced along the way, meeting more and more friends along the way was an experience we‚Äôll hardly ever forget. Which is why, from the bottom of our hearts, we‚Äôd like to invite all people who have been staying with us from the very beginning, all the regulars, all the supporters and all Epic Anime RPG lovers in the subreddit to our magnificent mind-breaking, breathtaking, one-of-a-kind event to celebrate our first significant milestone of this amazing community, and hopefully more to come.

# WELCOME TO r/SENSEISKITCHEN 1ST ANNIVERSARY ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥

https://preview.redd.it/afpob15e97se1.jpg?width=1782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad363ef500c52734c688a69bd7317f597354051e

# First of all, we‚Äôll do a full recap of the community üëè

**1/Achievements and milestones we‚Äôve reached:**

***For a small community like us, we have achieved some very impressive numbers in the subreddit:***

* 4.4M total viewers, average 365.85k viewers per month
* 16.7k total unique users that have visited our subreddit on average¬†
* 7133 Masterchefs that have stayed with us up until this point
* 979 posts (1626 if counting removed) and 12,064 comments have appeared since the subreddit opened

r/SenseisKitchen Restaurant Chain has arranged **5 different Menu Selections** from a plethora of entries that have been served in \[r/SenseisKitchen IS ON FIRE\], \[LOST RECIPES\] and \[ABI-ESHIUS BLUEPRINT\]. And with votes coming from various customers and some of the most famous critics in the industry, we have selected **8 worthy \[LEGENDARY DISHES\]** from some of our best, most talented, dedicated and ~~schizophrenic~~ brilliant chefs in the industry to represent our restaurant‚Äôs dish quality ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏èüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

**3 NSFW Days have been hosted** successfully across the year without the subreddit getting raided by bratty restaurant inspectors üí¢üí¢üí¢ (Hmm? Will it continue? We‚Äôll see üòò)

We have also achieved **a partner relationship with other communities with similar views and directions**, most notably r/OkBuddyTrailblazers. In the future, we‚Äôll consider extending this list if other communities with the same philosophy and pathway offer cooperation to us.

[Data taken on March 29th, 2025](https://preview.redd.it/eqhqy369r6se1.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=be51f62535e28390aa785ee4155554569d1f77ec)

***On the Discord side, y‚Äôall are seriously outcompeting Momoi:***

https://preview.redd.it/7dofnsykr6se1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6bb7239cecdccd934ab435feebf7bf857deb63d

Of course, there was one of you who single-handedly carried a quarter of this body count üòö

The server is even smaller, only for the real ones sorry\~ yet active with lovely people ~~who want to üçáyou,~~ accumulating **over 830k messages** over the six months it existed!

And our elevator just keeps crashing on the first floor, leaving everyone with an untimely death, what a shame‚Ä¶ so far, **only 11 people** out of the hundreds who entered **our 2 Elevator Opening** managed to survive this deadly contraption!

Since the opening of the server, Plana-chan **cunnyposted 6196 times**, wonder what will happen to this child if you gooners cause a kernel panic and overflow her little stack üò≠

Anyway, I‚Äôm sure more of you want to join the server, but we don‚Äôt do building codes here so the next elevator gonna be even deadlier üòògood luck\~

~~Also, we need you to look at this light, because I want you to forget the first server‚Äôs existence üòâ~~

**2/ Situation of the Subreddit/Discord Server during the past year:**

Over our first year, we had to do a lot of learning on the job and there were some mistakes along the way, we‚Äôve learned a lot during this time. How to protect the community, how to handle situations that threaten our existence and what our members want from r/SenseisKitchen. This is a place we created to keep the tradition of cooking unhinged dishes about our lovely students alive and well, to have a place where we can enjoy our cunnies in peace.

There have been issues, or, if you want to say drama, with other places on Reddit and beyond during this time. Feel free to keep pointing out how bad the jannies are in these places, just be chill about it as we don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth getting banned over it, after all, we are here firstly for the other aforementioned reasons. Remember to have fun and enjoy yourself first, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for.

Some of us want to see more focus on long-form cooking, long posts displaying their refined culinary skills for all to enjoy. While others just come here to enjoy the fresh seafood. There is even a lot of overlap between the two, but understandably some people feel frustrated when the dishes they put a lot of time and effort into writing don‚Äôt get the attention as other, lower effort content does. We pay close attention to that and adjust posting cooldowns to better accommodate everyone, but at the end of the day, we can‚Äôt force people to interact with it and even pinning posts makes little difference; our analytics show that this is the case. Even so, we want to take the art of cooking further and further, even turning it into full-featured games, so we look forward to great things from this kitchen going forward.

**3/For the future plan going forward with both the subreddit and server:**

* Maintaining the freedom with cunnyposting and cooking in both the subreddit and server to all Senseis with less restriction than the main subreddit
* Embracing our unhinged cooking nature even more, and promoting/finding more talented cooks via cooking competition(s)
* Finding more potential trusted members ~~and make them gei~~ and invite them into the Official Server via the Elevator system as a way for us to grand our gratitude and make the community even more fun and interactive
* Stay strong with the gatekeeping, preserve what‚Äôs true and what‚Äôs beautiful about the BlueArchive Community, while keeping unwanted content, toxic communities away
* Protecting the community from raiding, reporting storms and other methods of attacking from ‚Äútourists‚Äù and/or anti-lolicon groups

# Finally, some parting words from some of our Moderation Team!

This year was really the most stressful year for me alone, both in being the Grandmaster of a community like this, and various struggles and hardships balancing being a Moderator with an already extremely stressful and busy IRL life. Work keeps on piling up endlessly, my mental state was on a downward spiral, mental breakdown was now a monthly occurrence, I haven‚Äôt bring out a new dishes for forever, getting drowned with drama after drama when I‚Äôm started modding,... it just feels like life is throwing me knockouts after knockouts. But in that darkness, seeing how everyone in the community enjoyed themselves and making friends with \[...\] makes me feel like I have finally found a place I belong to after all this time beside the r/BA while it was in the golden age. So at the bottom of my heart, *thank you*, you guys are the rare ray of light in my life, and I‚Äôll fight until the end to protect this precious place.

* *Yivea (YiveaB74)*

Starting new things is hard, keeping up at them for long is even harder. Not seeing things through until the end, living off of passing inspirations without the discipline to finish anything has always plagued me. Finding like minded friends is life changing, the struggles and hardships are still all there yet it‚Äôs much easier going through them. When the day ends I find myself looking forward to tomorrow, I‚Äôm really glad this place exists, I‚Äôm grateful to everyone involved, and to Yivea for starting it after I got banned in r/BA. Thank you so much, words aren‚Äôt enough to express this gratitude, I want to keep enjoying our time here with everyone. r/SenseisKitchen is a very special place, where many of us made friends that will be with us for a long time, maybe for life. Let‚Äôs take good care of it, you won‚Äôt find any other place like it. I‚Äôm really glad to have met everyone, I finally found what I was missing, and a very special thanks everyone, to Yivea and Rai for being such amazing friends.

* *IC (IC8086)*

You don't know you are missing something in your life until you find it...I always thought I had a clear vision of how my life would go and that I was destined to live it alone observing but never participating, my thoughts, my opinions, my ideas and all what I had to share with another soul...I finally found a place to do so and it was unpredictable but if you put your heart into something and believe fully that it's the miracle you've been unknowingly waiting for then it will change your life for good...this subreddit, this community and how it came to be...yesterday it was a dream and today it's my home just like my dreams of today with my family will become reality one day too...I will keep doing my best and even though I might not have many words to share with everyone personally, I do love and care about you all ü§ç

thank you for your continuous support

* *Rai (Shiroraii8087)*

Hello there. It‚Äôs been a whole year since the creation of Sensei‚Äôs Kitchen huh‚Ä¶ What a journey it has been. I did not expect that making that one dish would have ended me up here, making me here right now. I enjoy everyone‚Äôs company here and I do enjoy looking at the reactions you all have when ‚ÄòUUOOOHHHHHHHüò≠üò≠üò≠PLAPPY TIME üò≠üò≠üò≠ü•µü•µü•µ‚Äô.¬† Being here since the beginning, it's been quite a bizarre adventure (Yes, this is a Jojo reference), from the fun times to the hardships we had to go through‚Ä¶ I thank all of you who are here in this community. Although I haven‚Äôt cooked as much compared to previous times, I will try my best to bring more of the dishes so that you all can enjoy it. With that I mind, I also like to thank the great chefs of this fine kitchen for the dishes üî• Also, the mod team! Can‚Äôt forget to thank them as well for all of their hard worküò≠Once again, thank you all, and may the flames continue to burn bright üî• ‚Äù¬†

I wish someone would wait for me. I wish someone would take my hand and walk with me. I wish I just had a bit more time to catch my breath and keep walking. But the path remains just as cold and empty. Some things often come by, but they disappear just as quickly, for such is the transient nature of life. Ever fleeting, and never stopping for anyone. But you cannot outrun this machine that drives the sole nature of life itself. You can‚Äôt run far away. Its treads pave the way ahead for you. Something to step on even when you can‚Äôt see anything in the darkness ahead. Look back and you see sepia-toned films of memories appearing spontaneously out of nowhere. There is no reason for any of it to occur, yet those are the only legacies we can leave. Barely small scratches on the surface of a scorched earth. Yet this machine works wonders and miracles too. For it created something like this‚Ä¶

Converging our fates to this place, I have only been blessed to see people create and enjoy something to their heart‚Äôs content. I am glad to have met all these amazing people here and witness some real fine literature being composed right before our eyes in real time. This place has been an inspiration for me to pursue literature. It all started from: ‚ÄúOh, why don‚Äôt I try ‚Äòcooking‚Äô something silly.‚Äù to actually going forward to realising my potential and the prospects of writing something so cherished. I have made a lot of friends, and talked to a lot of great people. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU! THANK YOU to everyone who helped in making this place a reality. THANK YOU to everyone who contributed to making this place the sweet, bubbly abode that it now is. THANK YOU to our Chefs, who roll out the finest dishes to ever grace man‚Äôs eyes. THANK YOU to everyone in the Moderation Team, who helped in traversing through unrelentingly unfavourable situations and still keeping this boat of hopes afloat. And finally, THANK YOU to YOU! Yes You! It is all thanks to you that we are here. I am so happy that you read our stuff and it really means a lot to us‚Ä¶ Please continue supporting us in the future and wish us good luck to live long. Love you guys. You are the best\~¬†

From the moment I understood the weakness of hags, it disgusted me.

I craved the freshness and tightness of cunny,

I aspired to the purity of the blessed loli.

Your kind cling to your hags, as if they will not expire early and fall.

One day the crude sub you call a temple will wither, and you will beg the cooks to save you.

But I am already saved, for the Kitchen is immortal.

Even in banishment, I serve the SenseisKitchen.

# Some words from some of our most trusted members too

Back when I was banned from the r/BA mainsub, I thought it was over. Not in the literal sense, but in the sense that I thought that I was closing a cycle and that cooking was this fun parentheses from that summer of 24 where I had the chance to participate in this subculture. Like most things I thought it would fade away, and I intended this to be the case. Were it not for some of the people here who reached out to me so I could join this project from the start (special thanks to IC and yivea), I would have silently deleted this reddit account and moved on. While at first we intended this place to be a recreation of the culture back in the mainsub, it slowly changed, rebelled and took form as its own thing; as did my own writing with it. This last year has been a blast and from the bottom of my heart I thank those who took part, small or large, into making this place what it is now.

* *Chad/char\_67 (el\_chad\_67)*

A long time ago, in the world we call R\\\*ddit, the profession of cooking was only springing up from its seeds. Small-time cooks lived modestly, sharing their creations from time-to-time for others to admire and be inspired of. These chefs were surely passionate and loving towards their work, which others have noticed and have been given the spark to create dishes of their own.

While these cooks were able to sow the seeds of their effort, they have also experienced discrimination and alienation from their own homelands. Eventually, they were disenfranchised and ostracized,¬† with no place left to call home. These chefs then decided to build such a place they can call home--an abode for fellow cooks where they can share and admire such dishes with one another. That would become Sensei's Kitchen--where chefs from all over R\\\*ddit have found their solace.

At first, while the chefs were able to build such a place, they did not really know how to host such a tavern with other cooks from all walks of life. They had to build it from scratch, after all. There were rough patches during its early times, even threatening its very existence. Thankfully, its members were able to sort things out eventually, and this abode would enter its peaceful times.

Now, as we add a year to its lifetime, I would like to celebrate this wonderful and most jubilant place there is to be for chefs and enjoyers alike, be they from Blue Archive or whichever franchise they may hail from. Personally, so far, I do not stay very long in one online space--I have been somewhat of an online nomad in these digital spaces. Upon retrospection, I also do not often find one such place where I would hang out and stay in for a year or more. To see that I will have been here for almost a year is quite unexpected. To my surprise, it is also this place where I have met some truly genuine and amazing people whom I can exchange ideas and banter with. I have found people whom I can deem as if they were my friends in real life--friends I can share joys and sorrows; insights and delusions; and prudence and depravity with. It is quite funny to realize that I have found such people in a space united under the banner of passionately depraved literature for certain characters.

With all that, I raise a metaphorical glass towards all of you my brothers who can see this. Let us celebrate our first year together, and wish for more peaceful times to come. Happy 1st anniversary, Sensei's Kitchen.

* *Umimi*

Jubilation. I never used to have any online presence of any sort. This was a first for me. A first experience, and a positive one. I am still not used to having so many DMs to answer... Hehe, but it is a joy. I remember seeing all the chefs in r/BA in the comments. I'd never talk to them, just silently admiring their work. Now, I'm friends with all of them, and became a chef as well! I couldn't be happier. I found a little corner I could speak without worries, without fear. I could say the things I believed in, and people, even those who disagreed with me, would laugh together, and join in the fun. I can let my mind go wild and conjure the most absurd scenarios to PONDER over, and I am grateful for that. To the mod team, and to my frens, thank you.üò≠

No more talking about it, here's an actual idea.

3 letters to designate a roaster. If the roaster has 3 words in the name you post 3 capital letters, eg. Mind The Gap would be [MTG]. 2 word names get 2 letters for the first word; first letter capitalized second lowercase and second word gets a capital letter, so Proud Mary would be [PrM]. One word gets one capital, so Passenger gets [Pas]. Cases like [AMOC] where they have a 4 letter acronym already being used can just get all 4 letters, the 3 letter standard would only apply for names up to 3 words long.

For the actual variety just type it out, making acronyms for the varieties would be a pain in the balls.

Japan's adult-oriented visual novel industry makes little money these days. One seventh of what they used to make 18 years ago.

[Pias \(PC88, 1990\)](https://preview.redd.it/q7fvnw80q7se1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b81f887ce9297bb19ac6824d9a76ee36608e64b)

You may think that an visual novel company consists of a bunch of nerdy guys and girls in some Tokyo office building: Punching away codes into computers and typing funny dialogs, brainstorming over a pot of coffee. I hope some companies are indeed like that.

But most ""companies"" consist of *one* producer / programmer.

That man owns the brand name. He hires artists and scenario writers. His office is a room in his small house in some provincial town. He's been using the same game engine for 15 years. He hires cheap artists barely out of high school. He steals background images from other games (but changes them a bit, of course) His writers probably live in another city. And none of those people are on friendly terms with each other.

So nope, sex does not sell very well. Your pastor makes more money than the guy who made your favorite adult VN.

So why make porn games at all? In the late 1980s, when these games were invented, there was really no other choice.

https://preview.redd.it/6rt3e20mq7se1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b29538c22fcb8c5bd3c80d6efc66f818ffb9e7e5

In thise days new Japanese home computer cost between 1500$ (MSX2) to 2300$ (PC88) That is, if you bought a basic model, without a hard disk, without extra ram. More capable, business-oriented systems like PC98 cost a whooping 10,000$ OR MORE.

(All figures are adjusted for inflation)

Casual gamers bought consoles like Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) which cost around 450$ and provided a much better gaming experience. Computers weren't optimized for gaming back then. The visuals got all choppy when you played an action game on your computer.

But computers could display kanji, most consoles could not. And computers had high definition graphics. (640 x 480 with 65436 colors for PC98, versus 320√ó224 with 512 colors for Sega Mega Drive / Genesis)

Illustrated interactive fiction was a genre that came naturally to computers. And since most computer owners were adult men, adult visual novels became popular.

But one would expect the genre to grow out of its roots. Novels, printed ones I mean... at first they were lowbrow romance & adventure stories. ""Sir Dagobert and Queen Joan fall in love when they accidentally drink from the same love potion. Sir Dagobert bangs the queen. The king suspects and sends Dagobert on a quest to..."" They soon evolved into *Don Quixote* and *Gulliver's Travels.*

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn‚Äôt appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I‚Äôm liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn‚Äôt want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I‚Äôm looking forward to taking about what you didn‚Äôt like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I‚Äôll hit u up for next time. I‚Äôm looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don‚Äôt feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction.¬†

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens.¬†

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character.¬†Non stop.

I‚Äôm not interested in ever being friends after this. I don‚Äôt deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama).

I purchased a DF54 coffee grinder from Frekko in August 2024 and have been using it with great pleasure. However, about two months ago, the grinder suddenly jammed while grinding. I opened it up and cleaned it, but couldn't find any visible damage to the grinding burrs.

Since then, I've noticed that the coffee doesn't taste the same anymore. The grind seems less consistent, and the difference between the grind settings is much more noticeable than before. Where I used to have more variation between a too-fine grind (choking) and an espresso that's too fast, now the difference is only about 1.5 to 2 steps.

I've tried beans from five different roasters since, but the results remain the same. I'm wondering if this issue might be related to the grinder jamming, and if anyone here has had a similar experience or knows how to fix it.

Does anyone else have a large backlog where they get paralysis on what to play next? I found that after sometimes days of weighing it up I would end up always playing a big budget 60plus hour game and never get around to playing anything else.

So for example when I finish a big game, I must then play a smaller Game, and after that must play a PSVR2 game.

Usually this is no big deal as I just don't pay too much attention, but we have this one group of regular customers who come in around once a week after their tennis game, drink a couple of beers or coffees, and have the most foul, fascist sympathizing, anti-immigration, anti-lgbtq, pessimistic, defeatist, ""the world is in ruins and there is nothing to do but complain"" conversations. 

Once a week they come in and have these same conversations and once I week I have to overheard them. Without failure it ruins my mood, primarily because I am powerless to chime in. They are regulars and spend a fair amount of money with us, as well as being good friends of some VERY high paying customers (i.e. customers who've bought expensive e-bike s and have them serviced regularly) I'm an immigrant in my country, as are they (though they'd probably use the term ""ex-pat""), as are half the staff in the shop, including the boss. I mention to my manager every time they are here that they make me uncomfortable and angry, but she just tells me to close the door so that I can't hear them so today I sent a message directly to the boss. I have requested to put up an anti-fascist sign somewhere, not necessarily antifa, but something like ""no racists"" or ""no fascists"" or along those lines. 

I am not interested in having a conversation with them as one I'm sure I'm not allowed, and two, I'm busy enough I don't need to be wasting my working hours debating with fascists. What more can I do? Should I just close the door and pretend my place of work isn't standing by and allowing fascistic conversations to take place?",1,1743508030.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

[This U.S. Under Trump is Strengthening Critical Minerals Sovereignty - American Thinker](https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/04/this_u_s_under_trump_is_strengthening_critical_minerals_sovereignty.html)

https://preview.redd.it/znaeext7l7se1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffa924237f1dcb657d93be1f0b9d01a6890b4bd9

The United States is taking decisive action to reclaim sovereignty over its critical minerals supply chain. As part of a broader initiative to reduce dependence on China, President Donald Trump, invoking emergency powers under the Defense Production Act (DPA), has directed federal agencies to prioritize domestic mining and authorized the development of metals refining facilities on U.S. military installations. This bold move aims to re-establish American capability across the full value chain of critical minerals‚Äîbeginning with processing and expanding into refining and manufacturing.

We believe this is a vital and timely step toward building a secure, resilient domestic critical minerals infrastructure, although we also believe that the order can go beyond using military bases. While these bases may offer available land, secure infrastructure, and fewer permitting hurdles, they are not always situated near the resource deposits themselves. Proximity remains a critical factor in building an efficient and cost-effective supply chain. Transporting materials long distances for separation is less ideal than co-locating processing infrastructure near mining sites. Still, it‚Äôs a good start.

**The Role of the Wartime Powers Act**

The President‚Äôs invocation of the Defense Production Act is a potential game-changer for the industry. It enables the federal government to:

* Expedite permitting for critical mineral mining and processing projects.
* Provide financial incentives and loan guarantees for domestic development.
* Prioritize federal lands‚Äîincluding military bases‚Äîfor refining facilities.
* Mobilize public-private collaboration to build sustainable supply chains.

This executive order clears a pathway to accelerate permitting, unlock federal resources, and support the development of refining technologies.

**Why Processing Alone is Not Enough**

While the move to establish processing facilities on military bases is an excellent first step, it is only one piece of the larger puzzle. The critical minerals supply chain includes five major stages: resourcing (mining),¬†[beneficiation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/beneficiation), separation (processing), refining, and manufacturing. China currently dominates every stage, especially separations, refining, and finished goods production.

The U.S. currently produces roughly 15% of the world‚Äôs rare earth elements (REEs), but nearly all of it is shipped abroad‚Äîprimarily to China‚Äîfor processing, refining, and final manufacturing. If we continue to export concentrates without building out the full domestic supply chain, we will remain dependent on foreign powers, regardless of how much raw material we mine.

We must open new domestic mines, build processing and refining plants, and bring manufacturing back to U.S. soil‚Äîquickly and at scale. Without a full-spectrum approach, America‚Äôs critical minerals strategy will remain incomplete.

**Policy Must Match Industry Commitment**

It is also critical to recognize that a free-market economy alone cannot compete with China‚Äôs state-backed overcapacity. China has spent decades investing in and subsidizing its mineral sector, enabling it to overproduce, underprice, and dominate the global market. Without targeted government support, American companies will struggle to compete against these unfair practices.

To level the playing field, trade policy, international diplomacy, and global collaboration will be necessary. Environmental responsibility must also remain a pillar of this strategy. While China continues to devastate ecosystems like Inner Mongolia in pursuit of mineral dominance, the U.S. must show that sustainability and security can go hand in hand.

Critical minerals are essential to the U.S. economy and national security, serving key roles in technologies such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, and advanced defense systems. However, the supply chains for these materials are vulnerable to disruption due to global market concentration and limited domestic infrastructure. The DPA invocation enables the federal government to expedite permitting, provide financial incentives, prioritize federal lands for refining facilities, and foster public-private collaboration to build resilient supply chains.

The Pentagon‚Äôs control over vast tracts of land offers advantages for locating refining facilities, including secure infrastructure and reduced permitting challenges. However, proximity to resource deposits remains a key factor in building an efficient supply chain. Transporting materials over long distances for processing is less ideal than co-locating infrastructure near mining sites.

A comprehensive strategy is required to rebuild the domestic critical minerals industry. This includes targeted government support to counter China‚Äôs state-backed dominance in the sector, trade policy adjustments, international collaboration, and a commitment to environmental sustainability. By addressing these challenges holistically, the U.S. can secure its critical mineral supply chains while maintaining high environmental standards.

The invocation of the DPA represents a pivotal moment in advancing U.S. mineral independence, but must be accompanied by sustained efforts across all stages of the supply chain. Success will depend on continued collaboration between government and industry to ensure technological and military readiness in an increasingly competitive global landscape.

We commend the administration for taking bold steps under the Defense Production Act and call for continued momentum to ensure full-spectrum mineral sovereignty. The time for U.S. leadership in this sector is now. Together, we can help Make America Critical Mineral Independent Again.

# APRIL 1ST, 2025 ~ The Hypersonic Missile Threat the U.S. Military Never Saw Coming

[The Hypersonic Missile Threat the U.S. Military Never Saw Coming - 19FortyFive](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/03/the-hypersonic-missile-threat-the-u-s-military-never-saw-coming/)

https://preview.redd.it/hz6bw78cm7se1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc35d9a99a16d74fbd1ee430b45266f935dc8bba

**Summary and Key Points:**¬†Hypersonic weapons are no longer futuristic; they are now critical components of modern military arsenals, with Russia and China already deploying operational systems.

\-Although¬†[North Korea](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/03/north-korea-wont-change-cant-change-and-many-dont-want-it-to-change/)‚Äôs hypersonic claims remain dubious, their alliance with¬†[Russia](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/03/russias-admiral-kuznetsov-aircraft-carrier-dilemma-just-wont-end/)¬†could soon make it a reality. The U.S. has historically underfunded hypersonic programs, leaving gaps in development.

\-Despite recent increases, investments in offensive hypersonics far exceed those for defensive systems. Continued neglect of sustained funding for hypersonic and counter-hypersonic technologies could leave the U.S. vulnerable.

\-The Pentagon must prioritize long-term development and deployment to maintain strategic superiority against rapidly advancing hypersonic threats from adversaries like¬†[China](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/03/time-for-a-new-pacific-charter-to-counter-chinas-rising-threat/)¬†and Russia.

)

***What Should America Do?***¬†

This makes long-term hypersonic attack and defense crucial to U.S. strategy. The former has received far more public and Congressional support than the latter. In FY2025, the Pentagon requested nearly $7 billion for hypersonic weapons, two billion more than the previous fiscal year, and another $11 billion for long-range strike weapons that include hypersonic programs. By contrast, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) requested slightly under $200 million for hypersonic interceptor funding.

In 2023, the Congress demanded the MDA deploy an initial Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) system, the most advanced and mature U.S. counter-hypersonic, by 2029, several years earlier than anticipated. MDA has awarded a $500 million contract to accelerate deployment.

  
There is, however, a serious risk that the Pentagon and Congress miss the crucial need for sustained hypersonic and counter-hypersonic funding. As hypersonic threats increase in sophistication in the 2020s, counter-hypersonic technology developed in the 2020s will become increasingly ineffective.

The next defense budget should provide sustained support not only to offensive hypersonic deployment, but to long-term counter-hypersonic development and deployment as well.

The First Trump administration began a welcome shift in U.S. defense policy planning away from the unfocused concepts of its predecessor towards a paradigm of strategic competition. If the Second Trump administration is serious about this competition, its Defense Department must demand from the Congress sustained support for crucial technologies, most obviously hypersonics and counter-hypersonics, to ensure the United States retains a key deterrence advantage over China and its authoritarian partners.

American adversaries understand the necessity of technological competition and are playing to win. Only strong leadership from the Executive on down can ensure the U.S. emerges in a sound military position by the end of the decade.

[Using niobium tungsten oxide to allow lithium batteries to charge faster](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-03-niobium-tungsten-oxide-lithium-batteries.html)

[Anisotropic lattice change upon lithium-ion intercalation. Credit: Nature Communications \(2025\). DOI: 10.1038\/s41467-025-57576-1](https://preview.redd.it/jeuktn4fn7se1.png?width=1750&format=png&auto=webp&s=66668c6e72d349e20d5937758768f05f01355d4a)

  
A team of engineers, chemists and materials scientists in China and the U.S. has found a material that can be used to dramatically speed up charging time for lithium batteries without loss of capacity. In their study¬†[published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57576-1)¬†in the journal¬†*Nature Communications*, the group used electron microscopy and machine learning to find a material that could be used to overcome bottlenecks during charging.

One of the major goals of lithium-ion battery makers over the past several years has been speeding up battery charging, especially large batteries, such as those used in¬†[electric vehicles](https://techxplore.com/tags/electric+vehicles/). The team noted that faster battery charging requires a material that can reduce the bottlenecks posed by materials currently used in such batteries.

To find it, the researchers turned to¬†[electron microscopy](https://techxplore.com/tags/electron+microscopy/), to watch how a charge moved through niobium tungsten oxide (NbWo) crystals. They found that the structure of the crystals had a major impact on charging speeds. More specifically, they found that if the crystals arranged themselves randomly while being grown, charging would occur much faster due to a reduction in lattice distortion.

The team next turned to machine learning to help them find the specific NbWo¬†[crystals](https://techxplore.com/tags/crystals/)¬†that would provide the type of performance improvements they saw with the electron microscope. After testing 84,000 possibilities, they found rGO/Nb‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜW‚ÇÖO‚ÇÖ‚ÇÖ.

Testing of the material showed that when charged at 80¬∞C, the material allowed for charging at a rate of 116 milliamp-hours per grain in just 45 seconds. That, the team notes, is 68.5% of the believed limit of lithium-ion batteries now on the market. It was also faster than the benchmark set by the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium.

After building a prototype using the new material, the team found that it could hold 77% of the initial capacity after 500 charging cycles, while also maintaining a high energy density.

The research team acknowledges that they have a lot more work ahead of them before a battery using their material could be commercialized, such as solving the problem of electrode thickness mismatches with commercial specifications.

She went out at night when my dad was gone, so I was the one taking care of my younger siblings (5F, 12M, 16M). Yesterday, while my parents were at the store, my dad mentioned that the guy she was with had been using some kind of scanner on my car (she had told me about it), and right after that, my mom called me and asked if I told my dad. I was confused at first, but then she hung up. When they came home, she had a huge argument with me and my dad, saying our marriage was over because of me.

Later, they had a talk and decided to get a divorce (they always say that but never actually do), and she told me that she doesn‚Äôt trust me anymore because I told my dad about what happened. What really bothers me now is that she's been ignoring me, acting passive-aggressive, and only giving food to my brothers and little sister. She hasn‚Äôt asked if I‚Äôve eaten or cared at all about me. It‚Äôs just making everything feel really weird and tense.

UPDATE 1: I was eating lunch and asked if we had any coffee creamer (we were out). My dad said my mom got some, so I thanked her, and she just turned away without looking at me and gave me a thumbs up. I hate this, and I hate living here with her.

Tomorrow my dad goes back to work, and I‚Äôm scared she‚Äôs going to take all her anger out on me and just scream at me nonstop. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll get any schoolwork done with all the tension. I don‚Äôt know what to do. :(

The guy rubs his face and says, ""It all started when I found this weird book in my grandmother‚Äôs attic. It had no title or author, just plain leather. I started reading it, and everything I read started happening.""

The psychiatrist raises an eyebrow. ""What do you mean? The book predicted things?""

""Not exactly,"" the guy says. ""It was like whatever I read came true. I read about getting a flat tire, and the next thing I knew, my tire was flat. I read I‚Äôd spill coffee on my shirt, and it happened right away. At first, it was just little stuff. But then it got weird.""

The psychiatrist leans forward. ""How did it get weird?""

The guy continues, ""I read that I‚Äôd lose my job, and the very next day, I was fired. Then, I read about getting a parking ticket, and boom‚Äîthere it was. It kept getting worse. So I threw the book away, thinking I was done with it.""

The psychiatrist nods. ""And then?""

The guy shudders. ""I thought I was safe, but then I read that I‚Äôd meet a beautiful woman in a caf√©. And sure enough, there she was. We started dating, and it was going great‚Ä¶ until I read that I‚Äôd propose to her. I didn‚Äôt want to, but I couldn‚Äôt stop it‚ÄîI bought a ring and proposed.

Please be kind! :) I am F/35.

Between 2017-2021 I was in a relationship with a man who I now understand to be a narcissist; he put me down, compared me to other women (particularly exes), isolated me socially, cheated, lied to me and got drunk and aggressive with me, one time physically. I left him in August 2021 and spent a few years single, healing and processing, and slowly rebuilding my confidence through work, friends and occasional dating.

In November 2024 I met my now-boyfriend (M/36). It is worth noting that he is sober, having given up alcohol two years ago and he goes to AA. His deceased father was also an alcoholic which would've been traumatic for New Boyfriend when he was a child. I am incredibly proud and supportive of his recovery and always give him a safe space to open up about this. 

We dated November-early January, when he ended things due to feeling he had 'too much on his plate'; his very full-on job, a house renovation, his sobriety, and then of course, his relationship with me. I completely understand this, having turned to Reddit and other forums at the time; when someone enters into recovery they must prioritise their sobriety above all else and between that, our relationship, his job and his home, it makes sense that I was the only thing he could 'drop'.

We got back together in February and all has been lovely since. I have recently gone self-employed in my job and am therefore without a salary while I build up my client base/income. New Boyfriend earns well and is happy to pick up the bill for dates while I am relying on savings to pay my household bills, which is very generous of him. He is also very good at keeping his word, so when we agree to see each other/spend time at the weekends he always follows through with the plans. He is affectionate, kind and supportive, always telling me I'm going to be so successful with my work, that I'm beautiful, funny, cute, pretty, etc. We talk about the future, particularly things like living together one day and getting a dog so we can go on walks/adventures together. I feel prioritised, valued and adored. A stark contrast to The Ex.

In the last week, though, I have picked up on a few comments and I don't know whether these are red flags or whether I'm just hypervigilant due to my past relationship, and possibly in an emotionally sensitive part of my cycle?!

1) I opened up to New Boyfriend about The Ex cheating during a talk about my relationship with New Boyfriend. He initially asked why/how that relates to our current relationship, but ultimately thanked me for opening up to him and reassured me that we are secure and I'm safe with him. The question around 'why' I was telling him, though, rubbed me up the wrong way!

2) When we first got back together we both talked about having rejoined a dating app and he'd said at that time that he'd matched with a few girls and messaged them, but no dates. On Friday when we were together at his house, he said that he did in fact go on one date. When I said this was contrary to what he'd told me previously, he said he'd thought he'd told me, or at least he couldn't remember saying he hadn't gone any further than messaging with anyone. (Part of me thought 'gaslighting' at this point, but in my more sympathetic moments I'm wondering whether he was scared to tell me at the time, but now feels more comfortable as we've had so many frank and honest conversations since getting back together, whereas before we were more fun, light-hearted, surface-level dating. Like does he just feel safer with me now than he did mid-Feb?).

3) I use gradual tan, and he mentioned while we were messaging last night that he doesn't like fake tan, joking that he was 'banning' me from using it. Admittedly I used a darker tanning product in December and January that wasn't great lol but now I use a subtle gradual tanner. He commented last night via WhatsApp on how lovely my skin is and said I'm good without the tan. (I'm thinking he thinks my gradual-tanned self is the real me lol so I think that's what he's referring to when he says he likes my natural skin; I don't think he's seen me with no tan at all!) This one might seem trivial but after being controlled by The Ex for a few years, this had to make the list...

4) I'm meeting a male business connection today for a coffee, who I've never met before. On the phone this morning New Boyfriend commented, saying something like ""You're seeing your South African today aren't you!"" which again, could've been nothing but my hypervigilance is thinking ""Oh God, is he going to start getting jealous and possessive of me?!"" PS he's wasn't referring to his nationality out of any sort of racism/xenophobia, just that this was the only characteristic I have mentioned to New Boyfriend about the business contact.

So, what are your thoughts? Am I onto something here, or am I oversensitive/spiralling as a result of my past relationship? And also because I'm in my Luteal phase lol?! I've been so loved up and excited for the future for the last six weeks, but in the last few days I'm now questioning everything...

Worth noting also that he quit vaping on Saturday so he is probably a little irritable right now, in the first few days of stopping nicotine! ",1,1743504556.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Farmers cannot keep up with the demand, most likely caused by the popularity of matcha over the last few years and it establishing itself as a caf√© menu staple. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing is planning on providing subsidies to farmers to grow more tencha. 

This made me think, should I adjust my personal intake of matcha, given the current circumstances? 

I drink 1-2 cups of matcha per day, not as necessity for caffeine but because I throughly enjoy the taste - the caffeine is a welcomed bonus ofc. I think it‚Äôs very easy when drinking a coffee or matcha to forget about the labor of love behind every bean or tin. This serves as a reminder to me to be even more conscientious and grateful for being able to enjoy such luxuries. 

I think I‚Äôll use this as an opportunity to reduce my caffeine intake in general, and drink more of some other green tea varieties like Sencha or Gyokuro (which I think has the most caffeine too?). In the summer I also love to drink some iced soba cha, so maybe I‚Äôm ringing in that season as well. 

What‚Äôre your thoughts on this & are you adjusting your personal consumption/intake?

Finding legitimate and reliable sellers for abortion medication in the Philippines is rare, but I was fortunate to come across one. At first, I had doubts, but they patiently assured me, provided guidance, and gave me all the necessary advice throughout the preparation and procedures.

Discovery and Decision

On March 1,  I confirmed my pregnancy through an HCG blood test. That week, I started searching online for options and came across a seller. To assure me of their legitimacy, they added me to various group chats where I could observe feedback and results from other clients. Many of them vouched for the service, some using private or throwaway accounts. I also learned that the seller herself had used the same medication, and the founder of the service was active in the group chat, addressing everyone‚Äôs concerns.

After monitoring the group chat for a while, I decided to proceed. On March 17, I officially placed my order, filling out a form and preparing myself for the process. Since I was in Mindanao, the package was expected to arrive in seven days.

Preparation Phase

The seller provided me with a list of preparations to follow for 10-14 days to help my body be in the best condition for the process. This included:
- Regular exercise
- Drinking pineapple juice daily
- Consuming ginger tea and coffee
- Following a specific diet
- Using primrose oil to soften the cervix

However, I was already experiencing severe morning sickness, constant vomiting, and heightened sensitivity to smells. Because of this, I was unable to fully commit to the preparation steps. The only thing I managed to do was drink one can of pineapple juice since I craved it.

The Medication Arrival & Process

On March 24, my package arrived in a small, discreet accessory box. I confirmed with the seller that everything was included.

On March 25, I asked when I could start the process. Since I believed I was already around 10 weeks pregnant, I was panicking. The seller asked if I had followed the 10-14 day preparation properly. Although I had not done so, I lied and said I started on March 20. Thankfully, I had read that the preparation was not strictly necessary and decided to trust my body.

With a set date for the procedure, I spent the remaining days resting and preparing myself mentally and physically.

The Abortion Process

On March 30, I fasted the entire day, only drinking water and pineapple juice. The seller provided detailed step-by-step instructions, infographics, and guidance for the procedure.

- 5:07 PM:Took the first dose of Mifepristone and waited 30 minutes.

- 5:37 PM: Took Ibuprofen for pain management, then the remaining Mifepristone. Placed Misoprostol under my tongue and inserted additional Misoprostol vaginally while elevating my legs. ( I elevatemy legs, since I'm having a hard time inserting the tablet I'm scared it might fall)

- 6:10 PM: Swallowed the dissolved Misoprostol and continued to keep my legs elevated.

Shortly after, I began experiencing side effects:

- 7:08 PM: Itching in my hands, legs, and feet (a normal allergic reaction).

- 7:40 PM:Mild cramps started but were tolerable. I experienced chills, i wrapped myself in warm blanket.

- 9:00 - 9:49 PM: The itchiness and the chills went away however Intense cramps began, so painful that I started crying.

- 10:03 PM: Light bleeding started; I changed my napkin and laid back down.

- 11:00 PM: Heavier bleeding began. Feeling weak from fasting, I drank pineapple juice to gain some energy.

- 11:26 PM: I stand up and had a little walk in my room, just to relax my body. Passed a large clot onto my napkin, sent a photo to the seller for confirmation for sac and embryo.

The seller confirmed it was part of the process.

I went to wash myself with warm water, but as I was about to leave the bathroom, I felt another strong urge. Rushing back, I passed the placenta onto the floor.

At that moment, I experienced a mix of emotions‚Äîrelief, sadness, and exhaustion. My partner was by my side the entire time, providing me with emotional and physical support. Together, we buried the embryo, closing this chapter with respect and care.

I still experience bleeding till now but not that intense. Had to take ibuprofens since my lower back is pain as hell right now. Will expect this to last till the bleeding is gone.

Abortion is a deeply personal decision, and no one should feel ashamed for making the choice that is best for them. If you are in the Philippines and considering this option, here are some key takeaways from my experience:

1. Find a legitimate and trustworthy source ‚Äì Research well, join private groups, and check verified reviews. Scammers exist, so be cautious.

2. Listen to your body‚Äì While preparation steps may be helpful, do what you can and don‚Äôt push yourself too hard.

3. Have a support system‚Äì Whether it's a partner, a friend, or an online community, emotional and physical support is invaluable.

4. Follow the instructions carefully‚Äì Take the medications as directed and ensure you‚Äôre in a safe, private space during the process.

5. Stay strong and prioritize your well-being ‚Äì You are not alone, and many others have gone through this too. Healing, both physically and emotionally, takes time, so be kind to yourself.

If you are unsure or need guidance, consider reaching out to safe and legitimate organizations that provide reproductive health support.

To anyone reading this who may be in the same situation: You are strong. You are capable. You are not alone. Whatever decision you make, it is valid, and your well-being matters above all else.

1jos9qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1jos9qx/trip_report_addis_ababa/,Trip report Addis Ababa,"Addis Ababa is a really cool city that offers both modern comforts and buzzling, crazy and colorful streets with a hint of chaos. I only spent two days here but since I hired a guide for a whole day I got to see alot! 

First of the churches are really interesting. My advice is to go to some of the cities more famous churches early in the morning. This way you get to see the morning prayer which adds a whole other layer to the experience! 

Merkato is amazing. Its said to be the biggest outdoor market in Africa. The first thing I saw when we got here was a guy running with NINE matresses on his head! Be careful wandering to far on smaller ""side streets tho"". I did explore these since I had my guide. But he told me I definatly couldnt walk around here on my own. 

Coffee!!!! I went to Tomoca in central Addis and loved it! 

Food! I got here when a 40 day meat fast ended so meat was definetly on everyones mind. There were animal markets everywhere. Goats, cows, chickens on the streets. We went to a meat resturant and got shekla tibs - a steaming hot pot of fresh meat. Expect to pay around 5 usd and up for this. Other great options are the national dish of Ingera (like a fermented huge pancake) with various toppings inside. This goes for 2-3 usd usually. By ther way wednesdays and fridays are alway meat fasting days as well. You will probably find meat in Addis but it could be more difficult. Expect to struggle to find meat in rural areas during these days.

Money! If you want to do tours and stuff. Having USD can be good, if you are lucky this could give you a small discount on the price since USD is highly valued. Bringing a good amount of USD to exhange can also be a good idea if you dont want to withdraw cash all the time. I needed like 1500 usd for all the tours I had booked and it took me ages to find a bank that would allow me to withdraw that amont in local currency in one go. Doing this through ATM:s would be costly. All in all I would say Addis is as expensive or cheap as you would like it to be. You can spend alot or very little depening on your needs and budget. 

I also traveled to Simien national park and Lalibela in the conflict torn Amhara region. These places are truly  amazing and I will do a trip report for these places as well. Safety here is a big concern tho.

If you are interested in Abbis Ababa I have recently posted a video about it on Youtube. Its in Swedish but I have English subs.

Hey MaximizeMe community! üëã Ever felt like managing your time is like trying to juggle flaming bowling pins? üî•üé≥ Yeah, me too. I‚Äôve always been a bit of a planner, but for the longest time, it felt like my to-do lists were writing themselves and mocking me. So, I decided to dive headfirst into two wildly different techniques: *time blocking* and *energy optimization*. Here‚Äôs how it went down.

First up, **Time Blocking**! ‚è∞

- **The Concept**: Imagine your calendar‚Äôs a Tetris game, and your tasks are those quirky-shaped blocks. The goal? Fit everything in perfectly, with zero gaps. 
- **My Experience**: At first, I felt like a master strategist. Mornings were for deep work (hello, creative brain waves!), afternoons for meetings, and evenings for winding down. But then, life happened. üòÖ Ever try to focus when your brain's gone AWOL? It's like paddling a canoe with a toothpick. 
- **The Win**: Ultimately, it forced me to be *intentional* with my time. Even if I didn‚Äôt always stick to the plan, having a framework was a game-changer.

Next, I tried **Energy Optimization**! ‚ö°

- **The Concept**: Counterintuitive, right? Instead of scheduling by the clock, you schedule by your natural energy peaks and valleys. Work when you‚Äôre energized, rest when you‚Äôre not. 
- **My Experience**: Game. Changer. I experimented and learned that my creative surge hits right after my morning coffee, while the post-lunch slump is real. Who knew? ü•± 
- **The Win**: It felt more freeing and less like a straightjacket schedule. I wasn‚Äôt just *working* smarter ‚Äì I was living smarter.

So, which one saved me those precious 10 hours? Honestly, a mix of both!

- **Hybrid Approach**: I block time *loosely* for my day-to-day, but adapt based on energy levels. Think of it as a flexible blueprint that changes color when the sun hits (Yep, Hogwarts style! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
  
- **Why It Works**: It respects both the clock *and* my biology. Plus, it cuts down on the guilt trips for needing a mid-afternoon break (because who‚Äôs judging?). 

Does this combo sound like something you‚Äôve tried, or maybe wanna give a whirl? Or do you have your own super-secret time hack that could put this to shame? üöÄ

We're all crafting our own adventure here; just remember, it‚Äôs more about the journey and less about the hustle. Let me know what you think...without any pressure! üòâ",1,1743503126.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Pero it came a time na I do wonder tatanda ata akong dalaga. So I prayed to God na ipakilala saakin yung nakalaan para saakin. Sabi ng nanay ko, lahat daw ng kaldero may takip. Siguro yung saakin ginagawa palang. Kept praying and manifested a partner for life.

2mos later, I met a man in a coffee shop and we've been together ever since. Si Lord pala, pag nagbigay, siksik, liglig, umaapaw. Siyempre ayaw maniwala saakin ni jowa na NBSB ako. Well, safe to say, he eventually found out na siya ng unang driver (he likes cars kasi so forgive the references) and super happy and proud siya. He is based na dito sa Pilipinas kaya we do see each other often.

Nagpaligaw naman ako ng 1 mo tapos sinagot ko na sya. Wala nang pakipot. We were 35 and 38 that time so yung maturity namin and settling down stage, pareho. We're enjoying (ako mostly kasi tagal kong inasamsam makipagchukchakan, sa afam pa!) our journey as girlffriend and boyfriend. So shinare ko dito to serve as an inspiration sa mga katulad kong virgin at sagrado katoliko pinalaki. Dadating din pala yung taong para sayo. üòä
