1k9zf1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1k9zf1b/how_bad_did_i_just_f_up/,How bad did I just F up?,"Ok, I have been debating on getting caffeine pills for a little while now: I hate having to spend money to get coffee on days when I don't have time to make it at home (and lets be so for real right now - I never have enough time to do that unless I am diligent on setting myself up for success the night before which...let's also be for real - I sometimes drop the ball on myself). And I really hate the headache that comes with NOT drinking coffee or when I have to take an allergy pill, like I might need to today, and I feel incredibly drowsy. 

So I finally bought 100mg caffeine pills on amazon. Today just a couple of minutes ago I'm taking my daily vitamins after eating breakfast at work and I also decided now was a good time to take a caffeine pill.

IDK what possessed me to look it up AFTER THE FACT but I was reading this can increase anxiety mixing adhd meds and the caffeine pills. I take a low dosage of adderall (5mg) and have a hard time with anxiety in general so I'm a little worried now. Haha. I mainly just hate how anxiety makes me feel.. 

So how bad did I F up?",1,1745856701.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1k9zdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1k9zdue/am_i_worth_being_with_someone_of_value/,Am I Worth Being with Someone of Value?,"My self esteem has been very low. Yet, I am putting myself out into the dating world.

There is this guy. He is the most sweetest person and I‚Äôve known him for 5 years. He became a marine. I sent him letters and we stayed in touch. 

He came back to Florida where I live for a week. I‚Äôm dealing with the end of my manic/depressive episode that required a hospitalization. 

I am primarily stabilized on Lamitrogine 200 daily, Latuda 20mg daily & Seroquel 25-50mg with higher dosages as needed to prevent a full blown relapse once I start seeing indicators with lifestyle changes that will continue to increase as I continue feeling better. 

I‚Äôm also in therapy 2x a week and stopped the main culprit triggers: stopped smoking high dosages of weed and abusing multiple cups of coffee, with some micro dosing I was experimenting with prior.

The main trigger though was and still is my toxic ex. He would bombard me with hundreds of phone calls and call me the most horrific names. It was so bad & manipulative that my family even had to put a restraining order on him. It‚Äôs sad I just couldn‚Äôt let go and do the same thing until up to my 3rd episode where all three had hospital stays because my family works and couldn‚Äôt take care of me throughout the process. 

Anyways, I feel like I am wearing my heart on my sleeve with this guy that got back from the military even though we‚Äôve known each other for 5 years. 

He has one child and is getting divorced. (They live in South Africa & he moved back because he didn‚Äôt feel like it was working out) I even attempted to talk him out of leaving her because I felt bad that this woman would have to raise a child on her own that was just born. He also said it was because she was acting ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù which included lots of unwarranted jealousy, and family problems. I think he just wasn‚Äôt getting acquainted well in the lifestyle & house gold of his wife‚Äôs family as he transitioned to Africa with no true financial support aside from his savings. 

So, that is why he decided to join the marines. 

Now that he is back he invited me to stay with his family. I met him mom and he knows O have bipolar and basis it mainly on environmental factors that trigger my genetic component. 

So, he gave me a lot of hope that this doesn‚Äôt have to happen again and always knows the right thing to say to cheer me up. 

In essence, I just feel like this guy is now out of my league but we have discussed what a full future could possibly look like, even though he has to leave :( 

I have already been in a dreadful, toxic, longterm relationship for 10 years that was long distance. 

He is going to North Carolina for 4 months and then to California for a year to become a cryptic linguist for international intelligence. Then he wants to strive to be based in Japan. 

I, on the other hand lost my house, closed most of my credit cards and am in serious debt, have no current job, and coming out of an episode. I was scared to even meet him for this reason. 

But my family loves him and said I would regret if I didn‚Äôt. 

So, in going I thought it would give me some sort of hope even though it can hurt so bad in the end once he leaves. It will mainly be phone/FaceTime convos and I don‚Äôt think it would be fair for it to be exclusive to me with all the wait time as either of us could meet someone before living together. 

Also, since there is an 8 year age difference I feel more of the pressure to meet someone to experience what marriage and potentially a child would be like with the right person. Even though in a dream world he seems like he could be the one. 

The main thing I got going for me is to finish studying to pass my board exam that will allow me into a good job market and I could even potentially move to California with him once he gets fully divorced as you can live with a spouse after you get to a certain level of training. 

How should I think and prepare mentally for this. 

Am I worthy? Is he out of my league? and how should I feel about dating people knowing that this condition can be trigger by rejection or relational problems, or not wanting to put someone through the turmoil of an episode. Or even worse, them walking away while you are in one‚Ä¶",1,1745856624.0,BipolarReddit,0,1.0,False
1k9zdtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1k9zdtz/does_animalgifts_appliance_sliders_truly_elevate/,Does Animal-Gifts Appliance Sliders Truly Elevate Kitchen Efficiency? A Comprehensive Review,"**Compact and Functional Design**  
The first thing that caught my eye about the Animal-Gifts B0C287T9N7 Appliance Sliders was their simple yet functional design. At a glance, these tiny, self-adhesive rounds don't seem groundbreaking. However, their small size‚Äî0.25 by 0.25 inches‚Äîmakes them incredibly discreet. I'll admit, when I first used them, I wasn‚Äôt sure if such a compact accessory could actually support larger appliances like mixers or air fryers. Yet, they turned out to be ridiculously sturdy, all while blending seamlessly with my kitchen setup. The silver color and smooth design also fit well, making them practically invisible once applied. It doesn‚Äôt scream, ‚ÄúLook at me!‚Äù and I appreciate a gadget that performs without being obnoxious.  

**Effortless Installation Process**  
The setup was ridiculously straightforward. You simply clean the bottom of the appliance, peel off the adhesive backing, and press it into place. I placed these sliders on my blender, coffee machine, and even on a hefty pressure cooker, and it took maybe five minutes tops. What impressed me right away was how mighty that adhesive is without feeling overly sticky during application. Unlike other sliders I've tested, there‚Äôs no mess or painful struggle when putting them on.

**Ease of Appliance Movement**  
Dragging appliances across the countertop has always been annoying for me, especially with surfaces prone to scratches. These sliders, made with PTFE (Teflon), create an incredibly smooth gliding experience. Even my bulky air fryer, which previously required two hands and a gym membership to move, now slides seamlessly into the corner when I‚Äôm done using it. I also tested them on carpet flooring with a toaster oven, and surprisingly, they held up quite well. I can‚Äôt stress enough how much easier it‚Äôs made those post-cooking clean-ups.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Great for preventing countertop scratches thanks to the Teflon material.  
- Extremely lightweight at just 1.76 ounces per set, adding no extra bulk to appliances.  
- Adhesive sticks easily to a variety of appliance bases, from glass to metal.  

**Wide Range of Uses**  
As a household with multiple kitchen gadgets, I found these sliders incredibly versatile. I‚Äôve slapped them on everything: rice cookers, air fryers, coffee makers, and blenders‚Äîthey genuinely work with each. Even my toasting machine, which I awkwardly shoved around daily, now moves with ease. They‚Äôre also great on hardwood and tile surfaces, although I noticed slightly less consistent results with carpet (my blender still moved okay but felt somewhat less smooth).  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While I genuinely enjoyed how these sliders performed, they‚Äôre not without minor complaints.  
- The adhesive is exceptionally strong, so repositioning them can rip off tiny chunks of the adhesive layer.  
- Movement on carpets isn‚Äôt as effortless as it is on hard, smooth surfaces.  
- They may not fit well on appliances that have large feet or strangely shaped bases, as I discovered with my toaster oven.  

**Competing Brands**  
Having tried other appliance sliders in the past, I must say this brand offers notable advantages over most budget alternatives. One contender I‚Äôd compare these to is a magnetic-style slider I previously used. While those sliders are fancy and reusable, they lacked the flawless adhesive strength of these ones by Animal-Gifts. Additionally, other options don‚Äôt often accommodate heavier kitchen gadgets, but these held stable even with my fully packed Instant Pot. For the price comparison, I‚Äôd say these sliders give other brands stiff competition in terms of usability and durability.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
Considering you get a set of 24 small sliders, this product feels like a steal for multitasking kitchens. Other similar gadgets I‚Äôve used came in packs of six or eight for the same price range, and let‚Äôs be real, that doesn‚Äôt cover many appliances unless you‚Äôre rocking a minimalist kitchen. These sliders optimize space and movement without laying waste to your wallet. Given their utility and durability, I found the investment to be absolutely justified.

1k9zb84,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k9zb84/explore_the_yabano_espresso_machine_review_is_it/,Explore the Yabano Espresso Machine Review Is It Ideal for Home Brewing?,"Testing out the Yabano CM6816 Espresso Machine has been truly an interesting journey for me as someone who enjoys experimenting with budget-friendly coffee makers. With its affordable price tag and compact design, this little machine caught my attention while browsing for a practical addition to my morning ritual. I can say it delivered on several fronts, but there are also a few trade-offs worth mentioning. From morning espresso shots to lattes during the weekends, I‚Äôve put this gadget through its paces, and here‚Äôs what I discovered.

**User-Friendly Design**

At first glance, the machine‚Äôs compact size and sleek black metallic finish made it fit seamlessly on my counter without cramping up my limited kitchen space. I could easily move it around thanks to its relatively lightweight construction, just under 5 pounds. One of its most appealing aspects is the straightforward operation. As someone who doesn‚Äôt consider themselves a barista, the simple button controls and clear design allowed me to quickly brew my espresso without fumbling around reading overly complicated manuals.

**Key Highlights**  
- Easy to operate, making it great for beginners.  
- Small and compact design perfect for smaller kitchens or dorm rooms.  
- Lightweight and portable for easy handling.  
- Eye-catching finish that blends with a modern kitchen setup.  

**Performance and Espresso Taste**

This machine features a 3.5 bar pressure system, which is sufficient for making basic espresso and even frothing milk for cappuccinos and lattes. I brewed up to four cups at a time, which came in handy when hosting guests. While I won‚Äôt claim it replicates the taste of a professional-grade machine, the espresso it produced was good enough to start my day on the right note. 

Something worth noting is the importance of using medium-coarse coffee grounds. Over the first couple of attempts, I realized fine grounds left a bitter taste and didn‚Äôt extract quite right. Once I adjusted to the manual‚Äôs recommendation, the improvement in flavor was noticeable.

**Upsides**  
- The ability to brew up to four cups at the same time, perfect for small gatherings.  
- Decent espresso quality for the price point.  
- Adjustable steam wand for frothing milk, creating lattes, and cappuccinos.  
- Saves money compared to frequenting a caf√© for espresso drinks.  

[Grab Yabano CM6816 at the best price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c1ghhcgm/)

**Milk Frother Experience**

The built-in steam wand provided decent results, but it needed a bit of practice to get the desired milk consistency for latte art. For someone inexperienced like my younger sibling, who tried using the frother, it took a few failures before they achieved creamy foam. Also, the frothing tool feels a little less durable compared to what I‚Äôve seen in premium machines, but that‚Äôs not entirely surprising given the budget-friendly nature of the product.

**Adverse Aspects**  
- The milk frother takes practice to master for the desired texture.  
- Slightly longer time needed to steam milk compared to high-end machines.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

What I appreciated was the ease of cleaning. Parts like the portafilter, drip tray, and nozzle are removable, which makes rinsing them a matter of minutes. My partner, who absolutely hates fussy clean-up routines, expressed how grateful they were for this convenient design. However, aligning and locking the filter holder in place while refitting it did require some trial and error initially, but this became natural eventually.

**Challengers**

Comparing the Yabano machine to competitors like the De'Longhi Stilosa or Mr. Coffee Caf√© Barista, there are some trade-offs. Brands like De‚ÄôLonghi offer superior durability and typically higher bar pressures, creating richer crema and bolder espresso flavors. On the downside, they are bulkier and cost significantly more. For an entry-level option, the Yabano CM6816 holds its ground‚Äîespecially in a more affordable category. However, for devoted coffee enthusiasts who prioritize quality over budget, higher-end competitors might make more sense.

**Money's Worth**

Given its price point, this espresso maker sits in the ""worth every penny"" category for budget-conscious users. It doesn‚Äôt aim to replace professional-grade machines but provides a good balance between affordability and functionality. For students, small families, or even office breakrooms, this product deserves attention. And while it may not last forever due to its mostly plastic build, I believe careful use can extend its life significantly.

I have been grinding in the range of 37-43 clicks, I'm also using the bottomless portafilter with WDT. 

I've struggled with some of the beans, the espresso has mostly been turning out quite sour. (I initially put it down to the freshness of the beans.) 

But today I bought some new beans from Tulum - Baarbara state - medium dark roast (roasted on 22nd of April) and I pulled a shot some time back and it was extremely sour again. 

I put 15 grams in and got 32 out in under a minute with a small pre-infusion of 5 seconds. I initially ramped up the pressure to about 2/3 bars and then for the rest of the pull around 7/8 bars (in the espresso range) and gradually let the pressure drop. Grinder was set to 38 clicks. I don't think it was channeling since the flow seemed to be even. 

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here, earlier I had a similar experience with Hunkal and I put that down to freshness, since the beans were almost 50 days old. 

Can someone please help me understand what I'm doing wrong here? Should I put in more coffee in the basket? Any help would be appreciated.",1,1745856410.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

1k9z9uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1k9z9uq/32f_i_blew_my_life_up/,32F I blew my life up,"I used to be very social with a lot of friends, and would never have a dull moment. I always struggled with work, but made my social life and my side hustle/hobby/passion a priority. (Stand up comedy) 

I had literally so many friends and connections. 

And now I have zero.

A few years ago, I moved into an apartment I could not afford, and got ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù at a job I was working that was really a demotion, but they gave me a title and I had different responsibilities but the same pay. Basically I came a manager for a coffee chain but I managed the slowest and smallest store and everyone worked alone. I was paid $37k a year. And after taxes it was more like $30k.

I also had just lost my father after an estranged relationship after my little brother found child pornography on his computer. He passed from COVID. 

The entire year I lived at this apartment I was behind on rent. I also had to move to a city that was 45minutes away from my job and friends. And i basically stopped having friends that year. My closest friends did not live in the same state. So my social life happened over the phone. 

I had also been ‚Äúcanceled‚Äù in the comedy scene for saying something a few people disagreed with was ostracized from the scene.  so the combination of losing my father and not feeling welcome in the scene, and being in debt led to a very bad depression. I had a bad drinking habbit, and became suicidal. I contemplated and fantasies about killing myself for months. I‚Äôd envision myself hanging from a tree and jumping, and someone finding me.

I would take baths and submerge myself until I felt like I was drowning and try to stay under as long as I could. I‚Äôd think about taking pills. 

I would get drunk and walk around the streets late at night imaging getting picked up and murdered. (Sorry this is dark) 

And then one day, I drank bleach. And immediately regretted it. I called my best friend in CA, and she told my to throw up, and I did. 

I called another friend and just told her through sobbs ‚ÄúI did something really bad‚Äù and she told me it was time to move in with my parents.

I told my parents after fighting for a year and asking for money to help me get out of debt and get back on my feet, and they took me back in.

I‚Äôm an only child and my mom is very controlling and Christian so taking me in and trying to change me was a better solution than helping me financially. They always claim they can‚Äôt, but the whole family knows my step dad has a million dollars in his 401k. 

I lived with them for 8 months, got sober, saved some money, bough a new car and moved back to where I had been living before I moved into the expensive apartment. 

Sorry this is a long story, but I need to write the back story for context. 

present day(ish) (two years ago) I got my studio that I love for $875 a month üôà and I started going to therapy and working at a coffee shop making $500 a week, and doing tours(I live in a tourist town) I worked A LOT, and vowed to never return to comedy and wanted to get my teaching degree. I had a social life and a boyfriend and everything felt like I had finally seen the dust settle. But with having PTSD, I had some serious underlying issues, and was still so stressed. My partner and I started arguing we broke up three times. Our mutual friend was involved and I was jealous of her friendship with him and begged her to stop seeing him and talking to him. She wouldn‚Äôt. and long story short, that friendship ended. and we broke up for good.

I got booked on a show and decided to do it and absolutely destroyed. it was the best set of my life. And I had it filmed by a pro who had worked with def jam comics, and he told me I could make it.

I‚Äôm very talented. I can sing I can act, I can dance, and I‚Äôm insanely good at stand up. and I decided I need to move to a bigger city so I can pursue this. 

While this was all going on I hated my day job, resented how little money I was making and I hated my boss (she was toxic big time gossip) 

A month later I quit my job without notice without any savings, and got a new job as a server.

And I‚Äôm happy in my new job. I love my bosses, it‚Äôs so much more professional and I‚Äôm making a lot more money.

But I kind of having nothing. I‚Äôm still not doing comedy, because the comedy scene has fallen apart since Covid. I have no friends because my therapist insisted I take a break because of my PTSD. 

I am completely alone. I‚Äôve never been more alone and isolated in my life. 

And I feel so regretful. I miss my friends I miss my social life. I‚Äôm so bored. I‚Äôve just been struggling so much and I don‚Äôt know when it will end. 

I see my friends on instagram traveling, being in long term committed relationships, buying homes, having a fruitful social life, and here I am tired, broke (I haven‚Äôt recieved my first paycheck yet, I‚Äôve only been there a week. It‚Äôs a cashless building so all tips are credit card tips. And the are given to us via paycheck) 

Idk what‚Äôs next. I feel really down. I don‚Äôt feel the same without having a lot of friends. And I feel scared to reach out because I think everyone thinks I‚Äôm toxic because of all the issues I have. I also just don‚Äôt live to same life style, and I don‚Äôt feel like an equal around them, and it affects my confidence.

I just feel like I needed to share this story and get it off my chest. I just want to have stability and something to work towards. 

I want to move to LA. I‚Äôve gone through so much, I actually think I could handle it. Everything is going up from here. ",0,1745856361.0,Adulting,0,0.5,False

At the time I got blindsided by divorce it feels like the worst thing in the world.    
But now 6 months later I feel more alive and optimistic than I have in my entire life.   
To those going through the dark moments remember:  It will get better.  This too shall pass. 

I used to wake up early to have some alone time and when I heard her wake up and come to the kitchen I'd feel the tension rise in my shoulders, needing to be on duty for her.  It wasn't conscious, I wasn't aware of it until the other day when my kiddo woke up early and I felt that tension again \~ then realized she wasn't here and it was my kid waking up early :) It was such an eye opener on the tension we aren't conscious of.

Now I wake up early and have a peaceful coffee every day.   I'm sure she feels the same way LOL

Now that I'm 6 months out:  
\- My relationship with my kid is stronger than before.  Our house is peaceful and calm.  No more nagging or walking on eggshells.  
\- My friendships are stronger.  
\- I have a better job, and enjoying work more.  
\- I've taken on more responsibilities at my volunteer position.  
\- my health is better..   
\- I'm taking on new sports and hobbies.  
\- AND when I wake up in the morning I feel relaxed and excited about the day ahead.

From a romantic standpoint:  
\- I've had numerous women reach out directly to see if I was interested in dating (which in my life has never happened before).  It's a huge ego boost.  I'm not on the apps - it's just friends of friends.  
\- I reconnected with an old friend and that turned into something I didn't expect \~ which is a bit of a mind fuck when you're with someone new after 22+ years.    
\- I'm staying true to myself and leading with honesty and integrity - unlike my early 20's when I was reckless with other's hearts.

To those going through the tough shit:  it will get better.    
You are stronger and more resilient than you think.  
You've got this.

1k9z6fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1k9z6fv/investigate_if_animalgifts_appliance_sliders/,Investigate if Animal-Gifts appliance sliders really make kitchen gadget organization effortless review!,"Testing the Animal-Gifts B0C287T9N7 Appliance Sliders for Kitchen daily has been an unexpectedly practical experience in my home. These adhesive appliance sliders are such a simple concept, yet they have genuinely improved my kitchen routine. As a self-proclaimed gadget enthusiast who enjoys functional and unique tools, I was intrigued to see how these small, round gadgets could hold up in real scenarios involving heavy kitchen appliances like air fryers and coffee machines.

**Smooth Design and User-Friendly Setup**  
The design of these appliance sliders is small but effective. Shaped in a compact, circular form, they measure only 0.25 inches by 0.25 inches, making them virtually invisible underneath your appliances. To install, you simply clean the bottom of your appliance, peel the backing off the slider, and stick them where needed. It took me less than five minutes to get them onto my stand mixer, and I immediately noticed how much smoother it was to slide it on my countertop without any hesitation. Even on tile surfaces, these sliders lived up to their self-adhesive promise and didn't budge or lose their stickiness.

**Ease of Movement and Protection**  
Helping large or heavy kitchen appliances glide with a soft push, the sliders made my life easier when rearranging coffee machines, blenders, and even my toaster oven. The PTFE (Teflon) coating gives it a smooth finish, ideal for moving items, and also ensures no scratches are left behind on delicate surfaces like wood, tile, or granite. With these installed, my kitchen countertops have stayed free of scrape marks, and I don't have to struggle with lifting heavy appliances just to clean their area. Killer find for anyone with limited counter space!    

[Check Animal-Gifts B0C287T9N7 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0c287t9n7/)

**Adaptability Across Different Appliances**  
Its compatibility with an assortment of household gadgets impressed me the most. I stuck these to my air fryer, rice cooker, and even my bread maker. Each setup worked beautifully. Plus, because they handle heavy weights like a champ, I feel confident these are reliable for most medium-sized kitchen essentials. Definitely cuts back on unnecessary countertop clutter, as I can now slide machines to the corners when they're not in use.

**Advantages**  
These handy sliders pack a real punch for such a small, unassuming item! Here‚Äôs what stood out to me:  
- Made moving bulky appliances around very easy.  
- Prevented scratches and damage to kitchen surfaces.  
- Versatile compatibility with glass, wood, metal, and plastic.  
- Value-packed set, including 24 pieces, was enough for my entire appliance collection.  
- Compact and discreet, they‚Äôre practically invisible once attached.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
However, they‚Äôre not without a few quirks that might be worth considering:  
- The adhesive doesn‚Äôt hold perfectly on very uneven surfaces, like heavily textured plastic.  
- While PTFE provides a smooth sliding action, it does create an ever-so-slight squeak on certain polished countertops.  
- Not the easiest to reposition once applied.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Brands offering similar adhesive sliders include alternatives like Magic Sliders and Glide-It products. The Magic Sliders, for instance, are a worthy competitor and work similarly well but lack the minimalist, discreet design I enjoyed with these sliders. Glide-It, on the other hand, is slightly pricier but also offers felt bottoms for quieter usage. That said, Animal-Gifts sliders provide a better balance of affordability and variety, with 24 sliders in a single pack making it easy to outfit multiple appliances without spending extra. The only addition that could make them better? Perhaps some variations in slider sizes for accommodating different base types.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the pack includes 24 individual sliders, you truly get more for what you spend. I‚Äôve shelled out more money for other kitchen gadgets that turned out to be underwhelming, so finding something functional at a reasonable price point feels like a win. The fact that these prevent long-term wear and tear on both surfaces and appliances justifies their value.

This medication has **absolutely** changed my life for the better. I'm so much more balanced, I get WAY more done, I no longer hate weekends, I'm friendlier, I know my relationships are better because I'm more organized, my workouts are better, I have energy to actually prepare meals instead of ordering out every night, I got off of the SSRI I was on because I'm sure all of my anxiety and low mood was just symblomatic of untreated ADHD. The list of how treating my ADHD has benefited me is *endless*. 

However, some weird voice in the back of my head is always saying ""Why do you need to take this"", ""Stimulants can be abused"", etc. I see so much stuff online about people popping adderrall and Vyvanse etc recreationally and I just hate that this is a medication I have to take. I also worry about things like cardiovascular health. and weirdly, I hesitate to even talk to my doctor about marginally increasing the dose because I don't want to have ""problems"" if that makes sense. As they say, too much of a good thing is a bad thing. 

The only thing I notice is it only lasts me about 6-8 hours. So I usually will start my day with a coffee to wake up, and take my Vyvanse around 11-12. 

(I also have a history of OCD, not much anymore, but I feel like it could be affecting my train of thought on this as well.)

1k9z4hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1k9z4hy/abusive_when_i_was_growing_up_reminiscent_now/,"Abusive when I was growing up, reminiscent now that I‚Äôm grown but‚Ä¶","TW ‚ö†Ô∏è: Child abuse

I‚Äôm 31/F. 

My mother abused me horridly until I was 21 years old. It was then that I decided to leave home and never return. Luckily I was in college so I had some foundation but I was in straight survival mode the following five years while I finished undergrad. I fell on hard times a few times ‚Äî even attempted to stop living. Thank God I wasn‚Äôt successful because life now is unimaginable.

At any rate, mother was emotionally and physically abusive when I was growing up. She lost custody of me when I was seven and I went to stay with her sister (who also abused me horridly, both ways). As a kid, mom was more physically abusive than emotionally. Once I hit my teen years, I had to come back and live with her after my dad put me out which‚Ä¶was after my Aunt put me out. My aunt said she was tired of taking care of me (I was 16 and the only behavioral issues I ever had were after I would spend the weekend with my mom). Therapists say it was a classic case of acting out with the hopes that one would step up and thus, I would be allowed back with my preferred parent. To my aunt‚Äôs defense though: I was only supposed to be with her for six months ‚Äî not nine years. My mom just would not adhere to the guidelines the courts laid out to get my back nor was she paying child support. My aunt never had any children of her own but loved me enough to take custody of me. We were poor as hell and almost lost our home a few times. My mom? Nowhere to be found.

Back to the abuse from mom ‚Äî with the physical abuse, it was pretty bad, in my opinion. I broke my shoulder when I was five years old, after she threw me into a coffee table for hanging a kids meal toy out of the car window. I got plenty of beatings with extension chords, hangers and whatever else was close. Then, when I was 8, she beat me on the head with a block heel shoe, breaking skin and fracturing my skull (small fracture but still). During this particular instance, she also stomped on my face repeatedly and struck me on the back with a belt a few times before it ended. Once I came back to her at 16, the emotional abuse began and the physical abuse never stopped. I jammed my finger my senior year of high school after she struck me a few times with a wooden plank and I blocked two hits. She also would strike me in my face ‚Äî open-handed ‚Äî often and to my surprise. The only time I could tolerate her is when she was drinking, which is sad. I said she was an alcoholic but she says she wasn‚Äôt.

Nonetheless, my final straw came at 21. I was home for the summer working my retail job. I had to ride public transit because I didn‚Äôt have a car. Mom knew this and had a tendency to start yelling and shit before it was time for me to go to work. She would actually wake up yelling at 6am, almost everyday. She made a store run and when she came home, we got into about something. Whatever it was, she ended up striking me with her car keys and I muffed her in her face. It was enough force to knock her down. She stood up and told me to get the hell out of her house. I came back once every week or so to grab clothes but eventually I left for good.

I now have lived in a different state since 2019. I have created a wonderful, peaceful life for myself. I spent many years of my 20s in therapy to truly work up to this point yet, now ‚Äî Mom is coming around. She‚Äôs constantly reminding me that she‚Äôs never going to stop being the best mom she can be while also acknowledging some of her faults. She is excited to share life updates with me but I have no interest in them. She often asks if I can come home to visit or she can come visit me and I decline every time because I can‚Äôt just act as if trauma is not associated with the majority of our relationship, in my 31 years of living. She doesn‚Äôt understand why I don‚Äôt acknowledge her or treat her the way her friends kids treat them and I just think to myself, ‚Äúthose people have no clue who the real version of you is‚Ä¶‚Äù She often asks about grandchildren while also expressing it‚Äôs okay not to have any. She is indeed a huge reason as to why I have none and may never have children of my own. I don‚Äôt think I would be like her at all but it‚Äôs trauma. I know she will want to be around and I grapple far too much with whether I will allow her or not and, since she has a history of making me feel bad for ever standing my ground with her, I don‚Äôt want to go through that with my child. Luckily, I‚Äôve never actually wanted children but I play with the thought from time to time, now that I have achieved all of my educational goals.

All that to say, she is in her reminiscing stage full blown. She will randomly text me baby photos of me and share stories of things she remembers from my infant/toddler years. Reminding me she‚Äôs proud of me and that she‚Äôs never going to stop being the best mother she can be but it just doesn‚Äôt do anything to me. I‚Äôm so numb to it especially because she missed ages 8-16! My dad passed a couple of years ago and it definitely changed who I am. So many things that used to matter to me, don‚Äôt anymore but also I‚Äôm way more intentional about  who and what I put my energy into. I spent almost an entire decade trying to fix things with my mom and I was never good enough to stop the putrid things she would say to me or the physical abuse.

She‚Äôs trying to make things work now and it‚Äôs just not working for me‚Ä¶

This drip coffee machine, with its sleek black finish and compact dimensions, fits perfectly on my small counter, leaving plenty of space free for other appliances. As someone who treasures their morning coffee ritual, this product has made life not only simpler but much more enjoyable. From its automatic settings to the handy brewing features, I could tell it was purposefully designed for convenience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact size of this coffee maker is a game changer, especially for individuals like me living in smaller apartments. It measures just 7.1 inches deep, 9.65 inches wide, and 10.63 inches high. Despite its space-saving build, it doesn‚Äôt compromise functionality. The classic black exterior with chrome accents not only looks modern but also manages to resist fingerprints and smudges better than expected. The ergonomic carafe design, with clear ounce markings, simplifies measuring and pouring without spills.

**Ease of Use and Programming Features**  
This coffee maker excels in simplicity. The fully automatic operation coupled with programmable settings allows you to schedule your brewing ahead of time. One of my favorite features is the Brew Later option, which has saved me countless rushed mornings. Just set it up the night before and wake up to the wonderful aroma of fresh coffee. 

[Check Mr. Coffee 2191951 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b081dnwg7n/)

**Auto Pause Functionality**  
I‚Äôll admit, patience is not my strongest virtue before I‚Äôve had my coffee. Thankfully, the Mr. Coffee‚Äôs Auto Pause feature lets you pour a cup mid-brew. The brewing process resumes seamlessly afterward without losing any coffee consistency. It‚Äôs such a small yet thoughtful feature that shows the company understands real-world coffee-drinking habits.

**Advantages**  
- Compact design for space-saving in small kitchens  
- Brew Later programmable feature for added convenience  
- Ergonomically designed carafe for easy handling  
- Auto Pause lets you grab a cup mid-brewing  
- Reusable filter and built-in filtration system ensure better-tasting coffee  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The brewing process is not as quiet as I had hoped  
- It only makes up to 5 cups, which might feel limiting for larger households  
- Cleaning the reusable filter can be slightly tedious if not done immediately after brewing  

**Performance and Taste**  
I tested the machine with different coffee blends, and the brewing process remained consistent every time. Thanks to the built-in filtration system, the coffee had a clean, rich taste with no off-flavors or impurities. The reusable coffee filter not only saves money but also keeps waste to a minimum, which is a win for sustainability enthusiasts like me.

**Competing Brands**  
One alternative I‚Äôve considered before was the Keurig K-Mini, which offers single-serve brewing with pods. While its compact size rivals the Mr. Coffee, pods add to the cost over time and are less eco-friendly. Another option was the Black+Decker 5-Cup Coffeemaker. While it‚Äôs comparable in size and cost, it lacks the programmable functions that I found indispensable in the Mr. Coffee model. 

**Price Performance**  
This coffee maker strikes a commendable balance between affordability and quality. It may lack some premium features found in pricier models, but considering what it offers‚Äîprogrammability, reusable filters, and a compact design‚Äîit‚Äôs worth every penny spent. It‚Äôs an excellent choice for anyone who values practicality and decent brewing capabilities without breaking the bank.

Review!,"Testing the Baby Trend TJ75B73B Travel System, or as I like to call it, ""my new adventure buddy,"" has been an interesting journey. As someone who regularly juggles the unpredictability of parenting, finding a reliable stroller and car seat combo has been more challenging than I expected. The Pathway 35 Jogger in Optic Grey is here to tackle that challenge and, so far, it's been an impressive performer‚Äîwith a few quirks along the way. From its sleek design to its functionality-packed features, this travel system tries pretty hard to be the MVP of baby gear.

**Sleek and Functional Design**  
One of the first things to catch my eye was how modern and stylish this system looks. The minimalist aesthetic in Optic Grey feels sophisticated yet practical‚Äîno excessive bells and whistles, just the right balance of form and function. The polyester finish gives the stroller a lightweight yet sturdy feel, while the inclusion of plastic and metal components means it doesn‚Äôt compromise on durability. The parent tray instantly became my favorite feature. With two cup holders and a closed compartment, I can finally stop awkwardly juggling my coffee, car keys, and phone. My toddler, of course, is a huge fan of the snack tray that keeps his little hands busy with crackers, avoiding the usual meltdown mid-walk. 

[Check Baby Trend TJ75B73B price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b07964g4ch/)

**Performance on the Go**  
Taking it out for a test ride was fairly smooth, thanks to the combination of 12-inch front and 16-inch rear all-terrain bicycle wheels. Whether navigating uneven sidewalks or cruising through the park, the ride is stable, and the lockable front swivel wheel makes maneuvering a breeze. However, the tires require occasional attention as they‚Äôre not solid rubber; staying on top of their condition might save a headache or two later. The multi-position reclining seat offers flexibility for toddlers who prefer naps on the go. It also came in handy during a particularly long park day when my kid decided he needed a horizontal lounging session mid-walk. The five-point harness feels secure yet comfortable‚Äîexactly what I would want as a protective parent. It genuinely gives me peace of mind that my little one is snug and safe.

**Comfort for Parent and Child**  
I was pleasantly surprised by how much thought went into making this system user-friendly. The adjustable canopy with a peek-a-boo window is genius for quick check-ins without disturbing the mini passenger. Rain or shine, it's been a game-changer during daily walks. The stroller holds up to 35 pounds, which should give us a decent run before needing an upgrade. The car seat, a nice addition to the bundle, snaps seamlessly into place, converting the jogging stroller into a convenient travel system. It‚Äôs a comforting bonus that safety elements like side-impact protection and the five-point adjustable harness ensure both short and long trips are stress-free.

**Favorable Aspects**  
A solid list of positives stands out about this product:  
- Smooth all-terrain navigation with large rear wheels.  
- Multi-position reclining seat offers excellent comfort for napping toddlers.  
- Sturdy five-point harness provides solid safety without sacrificing comfort.  
- Combination child snack tray and parent console make using it during outings significantly easier.  
- Lightweight frame and compact folding functionality allow for easy storage, an absolute life-saver in my space-restricted garage.

**Areas of Concern**  
That said, there were a couple of hurdles we encountered:  
- The stroller‚Äôs folded size, while compact, might still feel bulky for smaller vehicles‚Äîbe warned compact car drivers.  
- Assembly wasn‚Äôt the most intuitive process; expect to spend at least 20-30 minutes figuring out which piece clips where.  
- Air-filled tires, while smooth, require regular checks and can be punctured over rough grounds. This had me scrambling for a backup once in my neighborhood.

**Product Contenders**  
Compared to other travel systems on the market like the Graco Modes Travel System or Britax B-Lively & B-Safe Gen2, the Baby Trend Pathway 35 Jogger offers a competitive blend of functionality and price point. Graco‚Äôs offering feels slightly more compact for folding purposes but lacks the all-terrain capabilities of the Baby Trend. On the other hand, Britax wins with its undeniably plush car seat padding but comes at a premium price. The Baby Trend system thrives with practical on-the-go features like larger storage baskets and better jogging compatibility, making it a win for value-driven buyers focused on versatility.

**Affordable Quality**  
What makes this travel system truly appealing, at least to me, is how much utility you get for a not-so-steep price. Plenty of premium brands charge upward of two or three times as much yet don‚Äôt offer the same level of functionality paired with durability. For someone like me, careful to balance spending with safety and convenience, this product checks the right boxes. It's not without its limitations, but its strengths undoubtedly outweigh them, especially for parents who enjoy an active lifestyle.

1k9yzvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1k9yzvc/might_the_waterdrop_10ua_under_sink_water_filter/,Might the Waterdrop 10UA Under Sink Water Filter Be Your Ideal Purification Solution? Review,"**Reliable Water Purification for Any Household**  
The Waterdrop 10UA Under Sink Water Filter System has become a rather interesting addition to our kitchen setup. I‚Äôve put this under-sink water filter through its paces over the past few weeks, using it for everything from drinking water to cooking and even for our pets‚Äô water bowls. The promise of removing 99.9% of chlorine and other contaminants attracted me initially‚Äîbecause, let‚Äôs face it, no one wants their coffee tasting like pool water.  

Besides its advertised performance, the system's sleek stainless steel design caught my eye. It fits snugly under the sink without taking up excessive space. Despite its simplicity in appearance, this system includes advanced UV LED technology, which eliminates mercury leakage risks common in older systems. That‚Äôs a comforting feature for any household concerned with waste or safety!  

**Ease of Use and Installation**  
Straightforward is the best way to describe installing this water filtration system. I‚Äôm definitely no expert at tinkering with plumbing, yet the instructions provided made it simple enough to set up in under an hour. There‚Äôs no cutting pipes or complex hardware involved, which made my day‚Äîand saved me some cash, not having to call a plumber over. Using the included 1/4 to 3/8 adapters, everything slotted right into place with my existing water system.  

[Check Waterdrop 10UA price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0bpm3v7z6/)  

One thing I was impressed with was the power configuration. It comes with a 3-prong plug, which adds security for power flow without any annoying flickers or resets when the water switch activates the LED purification. There wasn‚Äôt a single instance of interference with other appliances, even with my coffee maker and dishwasher running nearby.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Intelligent auto-detection system that activates the UV light during water flow and switches it off when not in use.  
- High durability with its stainless steel case, ensuring both sturdiness and longevity.  
- Mercury-free purification due to the LED UV light, a modern take that eliminates traditional safety hazards.  
- Lifespan extended to as much as 50 years on the UV light housing, which sounds almost too futuristic, but hey, I‚Äôm hopeful.  
- Simple installation process suitable for non-experts like me.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The flow rate is capped at 2 liters per minute, which is fine when filling a glass but can feel tedious when filling large pots or jars.  
- This unit isn‚Äôt quite budget-friendly, especially for households focused on entry-level water filters.  
- It lacks advanced filter monitoring indicators; users might forget when maintenance is due.  
- Some may find the LED UV activation slightly noisy when water starts flowing‚Äîit‚Äôs not a big deal, but noticeable in a quiet kitchen.  

**Performance in Daily Use**  
Testing its endurance in real-world situations gave varied results. The water quality post-filtration noticeably improved‚Äîno metallic aftertaste or faint chlorine odor persisted. I used it several times for boiling pasta, and the clarity of the water remained pristine. However, as someone who enjoys hosting get-togethers on weekends, it‚Äôs worth mentioning the reduced flow rate did cause minor delays when refilling water pitchers for guests. 

Interestingly, the UV light also activates when water isn‚Äôt immediately needed, depending more on how the detection system has been triggered. It‚Äôs a small quirk that hasn‚Äôt impacted daily use but feels slightly off for something pitched as ‚Äúintelligent.‚Äù    

**Rival Brands**  
Comparing this product to others like the iSpring RCC7 around the same price range revealed some stark contrasts. While the iSpring excels in flow rate and thorough RO (reverse osmosis) multi-stage purification, the Waterdrop 10UA doubles down with its focus on UV LED for further sterilization. If power-saving technologies or mercury elimination are priorities, Waterdrop is the better option. However, families seeking faster water access might lean towards models like Aquasana AQ-5300+. It boils down to preferences‚Äîmodern design with UV inclusion or higher throughput capacity.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
For something designed with longevity and performance in mind, the initial investment is higher than average, but the reduced maintenance and ultra-long lifespan of this water filter offset the cost in the long run. Its LED replacement takes away ongoing expenses tied to mercury replacement used in some equivalents, making it appealing for those looking to save over decades rather than months.

I understand that Odoo has Variants and Attributes, but these are meant to create variants of a product, also they have Display Type fields limited to Pills, Color, Radio, Select, Multi-checkbox (option).

I have found some Odoo eCommerce websites which seem to have something similar to what I am looking for, checking the HTML source they use something called product attributes simple!

1k9yytl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k9yytl/explore_the_wirsh_home_barista_espresso_machine/,Explore the Wirsh Home Barista Espresso Machine Review Is It Worth Buying,"The wirsh CM5418, also known as the Home Barista Espresso Machine, has been a delightful addition to my daily coffee routine. As someone who thrives on a good cup of espresso first thing in the morning, this compact and stylish appliance has truly been put to the test on my counter. Having used it extensively, I can confidently say it delivers solid performance for its price point, although it has a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The brushed stainless steel exterior gives this machine a sleek, professional appearance that fits neatly into even the most cramped kitchen. Its compact dimensions‚Äî12.2‚ÄùD x 5.5‚ÄùW x 11.9‚ÄùH‚Äîmake it ideal for small spaces. It feels sturdy, though it‚Äôs relatively lightweight, which can sometimes cause it to shift when locking the portafilter into place. The machine‚Äôs LED indicators for each function are bright and intuitive, making the operation a breeze even for semi-awake, pre-caffeine moments.

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
This espresso maker is straightforward thanks to its simple interface‚Äîjust three buttons for single shots, double shots, and steam, along with a steam dial. Navigating through these options is surprisingly hassle-free, although mastering a perfect shot will require some finesse with the grind size and tamping pressure. The included plastic tamper lacks heft and precision, so upgrading to a stainless steel one is a smart move. Over time, I‚Äôve gotten into a rhythm that ensures consistently decent coffee, but there is a bit of a learning curve for beginners.

**Efficient Brewing and Steaming**  
Armed with a 20-bar Italian pump and a 1350W instant thermo-block heating system, this machine heats up rapidly‚Äîready for espresso extraction in around 15 seconds. I‚Äôve enjoyed experimenting with both single and double shot filters, selecting my preferred strength and volume. The commercial-grade steam wand is surprisingly effective for frothing milk, and I‚Äôve managed to pull off pretty decent latte art, to the delight of a friend who visited last week. That said, the wand does emit some water before steaming, so make sure to purge it first.

[Check wirsh CM5418 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08x627458/)

**Strengths**  
- Compact and stylish stainless steel design saves counter space.  
- Quick heat-up time with an efficient thermo-block heating system.  
- Effective steam wand for frothing milk and creating a variety of coffee drinks.  
- Flexible brewing options with single and double shot filters.  

**Potential Limitations**  
- The lightweight design causes sliding when locking in the portafilter.  
- No water level indicator or auto shut-off feature.  
- Machine struggles with temperature adjustments between brewing and steaming, requiring manual intervention to cool down.  

**Other Options**  
When comparing this espresso maker to others like the Breville Bambino and DeLonghi Dedica, its simplicity and affordability stand out. While it lacks premium features such as adjustable water temperatures or pressure gauges, it holds its own for basic espresso-making needs. The Breville Bambino heats slightly faster and includes advanced steaming control, but at a higher cost. The DeLonghi Dedica matches the wirsh CM5418‚Äôs compact design but doesn‚Äôt offer the same powerful steam wand performance. For those not ready to splurge on higher-end models like the Gaggia Classic Pro, this espresso machine is a worthy competitor.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its features and design, this espresso maker offers practical cost-efficiency. While some compromises are evident‚Äîsuch as the lack of a pressure gauge and an overly simplistic tamper‚Äîthe overall performance justifies its price. Reliability in producing consistent espresso, coupled with the versatility of its steaming wand, makes this machine appealing for those diving into the home espresso-making experience.

\### Splits

| Mile | Time |

|------|------|

| 1 | I don't know who cares? I did run a 1:56 first half and 1:57 second half though so can't say I'm not consistent



\### Training

Ran Boston on the Monday and spent the next 6 days flying home, trying to recover from jetlag, getting my ankle taped after some peroneal tendonitus which had flaired up from all the downhills in Boston, popping the blisters underneath my big toenails and cramming in my second carb-load in as many weeks. 10/10 preparation if you ask me.

My toes and ankles were so bad I was 98% sure I'd have to pull out of London on Tuesday and 95% sure I'd have to pull out on Wednesday. I gave myself Thursday to rest more (apart from being immediately back at work in the office and having my annual performance review that day LOL) and by Friday I was shuffling, Saturday I was shaking out and Sunday I was on that start line. The human body is one heck of a cool thing.

For a \*little\* more context, I had a pretty good Boston build and got to THAT start line well-prepared, in good shape and was proud of my performance there.

\### Pre-race

The train to Blackheath was absolute carnage, not to mention I'd got my first coffee of the day at London Bridge and it got things moving a little earlier than I would have liked...so I had a bit of an uncomfortable walk to the yellow start area. I was grateful for the women-only portaloos which had a slightly shorter queue when I arrived. Put on some industrial strength suncream (think sport the real MVP of the day) and asked someone's mum to put some on my back cos you can trust a mum to do a good job.

It was a beautiful day, the sun was out, vibes all round. I saw my friend and we did a little warm-up and some strides outside the start area. We heard the elites get going and I saw my second human shit of the week in a place in shouldn't be. All-in-all, a mixed bag. 

\### Race

I knew I wouldn't have my legs to count on for these 26.2 miles and I'd made peace with that. Every time it hurt, I'd just tell myself ""well, you knew this was going to hurt"". This was my fifth London and the only time I've not raced it for a PB and all I wanted was all the things you miss when you're watching your splits and evaluating whether to stick or twist with your pacing or taking on fuel. I was there for a GOOD time AND a LONG time. If it took me 5+ hours, so be it, I was going to enjoy every minute. So that's what I did.

The energy I didn't have in my legs I had in my heart. I high-fived every kid, I petted every dog, I danced to every DJ, I screamed at EVERYONE to make them scream at me. It was hot, I was thirsty, I could feel my heart rate climbing. It didn't matter, I was living this race like it was my last day on earth. 

I had a few people out on the course but I was a bit sad I hadn't seen anyone for 12 miles, until lo and behold someone GRABS me on Tower Bridge and it's my friend - my first friend I'd seen in the race - it was honestly a core memory, RIGHT there in front of the photographers like it was meant to be. She sped ahead and I came off Tower Bridge absolutely buzzing, my ears ringing from the noise - was definitely one of the most electric Tower Bridge sections in all five years I've run. I looked for some familiar faces in the crowd at 13 miles and locked eyes with Gordon Ramsey who gave me a big cheer (surreal). Shortly after that I started seeing some of my speedy championship friends coming down the other side of the road so I screamed their names as they looked DEEP in the pain cave.

The section after as you go through Limehouse and Isle of Dogs is always a bit grim, its about 15-18 miles which is always the section where you feel tired but you've still got so far to go. I think this is when I started picking off the kms/miles and trying to do something fun each one, interact with a spectator, have a jelly baby, just something to get me through to mile 20 when I knew I'd be seeing my friends spectating again at various points until the finish. Coming out of Canary Wharf people looked TIRED, if someone was struggling beside me I tried to encourage them, I'd tell them we were in single-figure kms now (always helps me), offer them a sweet or some water, try to hype them up. Maybe I was that annoying person who had the energy to do that, maybe I made someone feel better, I don't know but I was sure as hell going to bring that energy home with me. I thanked EVERY volunteer I saw and seeing the JOY it brought to them honestly transformed the rest of the race for me so much so that I did it everywhere until the end of the race. Giving out all the love and gratitude made me feel like I could run forever. 

That long 5-6 mile staight from Canary Wharf to home were the best crowds I've ever seen at London. And it built and built and built. I saw a friend or group of friends every mile who'd hype me up as I went past. If you've ever been a spectator seeing your friend for 3 seconds in a race just KNOW it gives them AT LEAST 5 whole minutes of energy. I was just getting more and more hyped as I ran. At 23 miles, I pulled up to chug a free beer off some strangers who went absolutely mental as I crushed the red cup on the ground. At mile 24, I ran through a tunnel of people singing Sweet Caroline just as the BUM BUM BUM kicks in and locked eyes with these two guys and screamed SO GOOD! SO GOOD! along with the song. This was just before the Lucozade tunnel (stickiest tunnel EVER, felt like I was back at a club which did 3 for ¬£1 jaagerbombs) and then you're in, embankment, big ben, to home. I won't lie, that stretch feels LONG, but I didn't care, I was there - fully present. I am not a religious person, but I think of God (what/whomever that is) a lot when I run, especially on this straight. But maybe that's what those mad endorphins do to ya or what people mean when they say they ""saw God"". At some point I looked at my watch for the first time and thought ""oh I'm gonna run sub-4, that's cool, at least I'll get to the after-party on time"".

Ran past Big Ben and down Birdcage walk before the turn onto the Mall. It was like I was making every single person down Birdcage Walk scream for ME - they probably weren't, but I was weaving and waving like a mad person to get them to go louder and louder. 

As we dipped under the 385 yards to go sign my ONLY criticism of the day would be that that bit was SILENT. I don't think the public can access the grandstands and to be honest they were a bit dead? So I tried shouting at everyone down the mall to give them their moment, I was shouting ""You're gonna do it! You're gonna do the marathon! You're gonna make all your dreams come true!"". 

Crossing the finish line, I felt an incredible sense of peace. 10 marathons, 2 in the same week, Boston which had been my dream for many, many years and London - my born and bred home - a full circle moment from the girl who thought ONE marathon was impossible. I knew I'd be giving the marathon a rest for a little while after this, so this was the perfect end to that chapter of my running.

I ran my slowest ever London, but probably my best ever race and I still have that fuzzy, glowy feeling today of just how wonderful running really is. If you've never run a marathon for vibes before, I HIGHLY recommend it.

This summer will be fast-paced, demanding, and incredibly rewarding. Here's your go-to guide to help you succeed:

# 1. Professionalism First

* **Dress Code:** Business professional unless otherwise instructed. Always err on the side of more formal (suits, blazers, conservative dresses, polished shoes).
* **Punctuality:** Always be on time: 10 minutes early is considered on time on the Hill.
* **Communication:** Address everyone formally (Senator, Mr./Ms., Dr.) unless told otherwise. Proofread your emails carefully.

# 2. Daily Duties

You may be assigned:

* Answering phones
* Sorting mail
* Giving tours of the Capitol
* Attending hearings/briefings and writing memos
* Drafting constituent correspondence
* Research projects for staffers or legislative assistants
* General office support (copies, errands)

No task is ""beneath"" you. Treat every assignment seriously.

# 3. Building Relationships

* **Introduce yourself** to staffers across the office.
* **Be helpful**: Look for ways to anticipate needs.
* **Stay positive**: People remember attitudes, especially when stress levels rise.

Hill jobs are often filled through word-of-mouth, a good impression can lead to job offers later.

# 4. Networking Tips

* Ask for coffee meetings with staffers to learn about their career paths.
* Attend receptions (if allowed), free food and great contacts!
* Follow up with handwritten thank-you notes when someone gives you their time.

Be curious, not pushy. You are there to learn, not just to collect business cards.

# 5. Handling Sensitive Information

* **Confidentiality is critical.** Do not discuss internal matters outside the office or post them online.
* **Social media caution:** Never post photos of confidential documents, internal meetings, or behind-the-scenes activities unless explicitly authorized.

**Remember:** You're representing the office, the Senator, and yourself, act accordingly.

# 6. Capitol Tour Basics

* Learn how to give tours early! Many offices provide scripts, but practicing on your own will help.
* Focus on major highlights: Rotunda, National Statuary Hall, Old Senate Chamber.
* Be ready for questions, you don't need to know everything, but know how to find the answer.

# 7. Office Culture

* Every office is different: pay attention to norms.
* Some are formal and structured; others are casual. Adapt quickly.
* If in doubt: Ask your intern coordinator or supervisor.

# 8. Time Management

* Internships are short: make every day count.
* Prioritize tasks: urgent first, important second.
* Keep a notebook with assignments, deadlines, and questions.

**Pro Tip:** Write down one takeaway every day to track what you‚Äôre learning.

# 9. Self-Care

* The Hill is demanding. Stay hydrated, eat regular meals, and get enough sleep.
* If you feel overwhelmed, ask for help early. Good offices would rather you ask than struggle in silence.

# 10. Final Week Checklist

* Request letters of recommendation (if appropriate).
* Update your resume with specific projects/accomplishments.
* Send thank-you notes to supervisors and mentors.
* Stay in touch with contacts you've built.



**Final Advice: Work hard. Stay humble. Listen more than you speak. Always ask how you can help.**

1k9yr3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k9yr3t/explore_if_the_mr_coffee_5cup_programmable_coffee/,Explore if the Mr. Coffee 5-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker is worth it review!,"**A Real User‚Äôs Take on Mr. Coffee 2191951 5-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker**  

My mornings have seen quite the change lately, thanks to a little gadget I decided to try. The Mr. Coffee 2191951 Programmable Coffee Maker landed on my kitchen counter a few weeks ago, and let me just say, it's holding its ground impressively. From its snug, space-saving design to the thoughtful features packed into its compact frame, this coffee maker brings a lot to the table... or rather, countertop. Yet, it's not without its quirks‚Äîbecause no product's perfect, right?

**Compact and Practical**  

One of the most noticeable things about this small coffee maker is how perfectly it fits into tight spaces in my kitchen. At just 7.1"" deep and 9.65"" wide, my cluttered countertop hardly noticed its arrival. This design feels especially apt for those living in apartments, dorms, or managing limited space, like my sister's tiny city studio. With its understated black finish and decent build quality, it doesn‚Äôt scream luxury but doesn‚Äôt look cheap either.  

Something else worth mentioning: this coffee maker isn‚Äôt enormous, so it maxes out at 25 ounces, enough for two 12 oz. cups (perfect for solo drinkers like me or quiet mornings with your significant other).  

**Programmable Brewing Takes the Cake**  

Programming the brew timer? Game-changer. I‚Äôve never been a morning person, so having the option to set it up the night before to brew ahead saves me from fumbling around pre-coffee. Picture me waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee‚Äîit's an actual lifesaver. Adding to the practicality, the auto-pause function lets me sneak in a quick pour before the entire batch is ready. Let‚Äôs just say patience and I don‚Äôt get along before caffeine kicks in.  

[Check Mr. Coffee 2191951 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b081dnwg7n/)  

**Ease of Use and Ergonomics**  

Operating this machine is effortless. A couple of buttons and a reusable filter system handle the job. It doesn‚Äôt ask much from you but gives exactly what you need: a hot pot of coffee in under 10 minutes. Its ergonomic carafe includes marked ounce measurements, which keeps me from second-guessing how much water to add. My overly groggy mornings thank this simple yet thoughtful touch.  

When pouring coffee, spills are minimal, though not entirely absent if you rush it. The carafe feels solid enough in my hands, with a handle that‚Äôs easy to hold. My kid brother even managed a spill-free pour after struggling with our clunky old machine‚Äîso that‚Äôs saying something!  

**Positives**  

- Brew timer allows programming coffee ahead of time.  
- Auto-pause and auto-shutoff features increase convenience.  
- Compact, perfect for small spaces.  

**Brewing Quality**  

The end result? Decent coffee. It's not gourmet, but for a drip coffee maker under this category, it‚Äôs more than satisfactory. I didn‚Äôt encounter any off-putting bitterness, and the included filtration system delivered a clean taste that my less-discerning tastebuds are perfectly happy with. Still, do note: serious coffee enthusiasts might feel it leans basic. My coworker, who swears by pour-over or French press, claims the flavor doesn‚Äôt ""pop."" That being said, I genuinely enjoyed the consistency this machine provides over my lazy grind-and-brew setups.  

**Challenges**  

- Limited brewing size may not suit families or larger households.  
- Lacks customization for brew strength.  
- Temperature could use slight improvement (coffee cools quicker than preferred).  

**Product Rivals in Focus**  

When comparing this programmable coffee maker with similar options on the market, certain pros and cons come into play. For instance, Hamilton Beach‚Äôs compact coffee maker offers a comparable space-saving design but includes fewer programmable features. Keurig systems provide more versatility with pod options, but they‚Äôre pricier and contribute significant waste.  

This coffee maker holds its own by covering the sweet middle ground. Features like its reusable filter and programmable brew options give it legs to stand on, especially at its price point. Competitive products might outmatch it in tech-savvy features, but there‚Äôs value in simplicity, and this machine has it in spades.  

**Smart Spending**  

Considering its price range, it‚Äôs safe to say you get fair value for what this coffee maker offers. Sure, it‚Äôs not a bespoke espresso machine, but most people wouldn't expect it to be. With reliable core functions and added conveniences like automatic shutoff, it‚Äôs a hardworking gadget that justifies a spot in smaller kitchens.

Linux Foundation just announced that 2025 will mark the largest-ever global investment in open-source projects, with corporate giants like Google, Intel, and even unexpected players like Visa throwing in billions. Open-source contributions are becoming one of the hottest skills employers look for. (Hint: if you aren't already contributing to GitHub projects, maybe it's time!)

3. Quantum Computing is Moving From Theory to Reality.
IBM and Microsoft both claim their quantum research teams have hit major breakthroughs ‚Äî we're talking about solving certain problems millions of times faster than classical computers. New programming languages for quantum systems (like Q# and Qiskit) are gaining traction. If you're adventurous, learning quantum programming now could be the wildest flex of your career in a few years.

4. Fun Fact of the Day: ""Hello, World!"" Turns 50!
Can you believe it? The first recorded ""Hello, World!"" was printed back in 1974. Today, it's still the universal symbol for kicking off your journey into any new programming language. Cheers to the little phrase that started it all!

1k9ymss,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1k9ymss/swimming_boomer/,Swimming boomer,"Boomer story inspired by one I read sooner about a lifeguard in Florida dealing with a misogynistic boomer.

My story takes place on the Danube river I think around June 2021, when I used to work around river cruise ships. Average age of the passengers: 70, if not 75.

On the first evening on a cruise ship there is a little cocktail during which the passengers meet the crew and get the very important informations: here the emergency phone numbers in case of emergency, please don‚Äôt jump from the boat to the pier when there is no boarding ramp, please don‚Äôt jump from the pier to the boat when there is no boarding ramp! ( Yes, you have to spell it clearly for both ways because for them it‚Äôs not clear enough the action is dangerous, they need to understand the direction in which the action is dangerous.) They also need to be told the meeting points in case of emergency: ‚Äûduring navigation, the meeting point is on the highest bridge. When moored, the meeting point is outside the ship. If ever you hear this *whistle*, get your life jacket from your cabin and follow our instructions.‚Äú

Then always came the explanation on how to put a life jacket, with the strict command:
‚ÄûDO NOT JUMP IN THE RIVER! YOU WILL DIE! YOU WILL DIE WITHOUT LIFE JACKET ON, YOU WILL DIE WITH A LIFE JACKET ON!!!!
DO NOT JUMP IN THE WATER!‚Äú

Here comes the boomer, around 75, walking with a stick: ‚ÄûI‚Äôm a good swimmer!‚Äú

The cruise manager explains to him: ‚Äûplease don‚Äôt, you may be a good swimmer but you will die, the water is cold, damage, failure and incident happen mostly at night so we won‚Äôt be able to locate you and save you. YOU WILL DIE! The energy and time we will put into looking for you is the energy we won‚Äôt be able to put into looking after all the other passengers. YOU WILL DIE AND YOU WILL POTENTIALLY KILL OTHER PEOPLE WHILE DIYING.‚Äù

Boomer mumbles: I‚Äôm good‚Ä¶ swimmer‚Ä¶ river where I come from‚Ä¶. 1968‚Ä¶ crossed thrice‚Ä¶ big‚Ä¶ good swimmer‚Ä¶‚Äú

So because this idiot is disruptive the cruise manager introduced me to the passengers asking me to explain the danger of the river and so I abide: ‚ÄûHello, I am more than a good swimmer, I used to swim for the junior national team of my country, I am also a certified lifeguard and I have been living and working around the Danube river for the last 10 years. The Danube is not only powerful in the middle, it is also powerful on the banks and you will be flowing with the stream in no time with a bit of bouncing on the rocks and/or risk to get dragged under tree roots. The Danube is a powerful and wild river, whose stream has been canalised only in some parts: upstream from Vienna it behaves like a mountain river and is deadly, downstream from Vienna it behaves like a plain river and is extremely large, aka deadly.
In Bratislava, every year in September there is a Danube crossing in 20celsius water, 2000m3/s flow and it take healthy swimmers between 20 and 30mn to cross. I did it 4 times, the first time I almost died because I was stubborn and wanted to swim as if I was in an Olympic pool. Don‚Äôt do it, you will die! End of the conversation, if you do not agree now, we will disembark you for the safety of the crew and the safety of other passengers.‚Äú

Two weeks after when I see the cruise manager again he tells me how the boomer spent the whole cruise talking about how wrong we were and how good of a swimmer he is, trying every single occasion he could to put his feet in the Danube and commenting on the temperature, or extrapolating the power of the stream in the fairway from the power of the stream on the bank. How the simple view of a coffee machine was a good start for him to compare the flows and the temperature. A bit of honey in the morning: a good start to talk about buoyancy and fluids. Excursion start at 8:30? That‚Äôs a good occasion to tell everybody he still has time to shower because he is very fast, thanks to his habit to shower under cold water. A maneuvering thruster failed mid turn which allowed him to calculate approximately the downward stream and conclude it was still in the realm of possible for him to cross the Danube. ( remember: 75, walking with a stick)

I remember everything vividly because I had to write everything down in details: a week after the cruise manager told me everything, both him and I received a formal complaint from the company asking us to explain why we ‚Äûteamed up to humiliate a passenger in front of the whole ship, ruining his cruise and his relationship with his wife and friends.‚Äú
It took a couple weeks of exchanges with the HR before both the cruise manager and I decided to put a stop on it and say that no preventing someone from dying is not harassment, it‚Äôs not humiliating and if he feels so emasculated he should sue us and, it closed the chapter because we never got any update on the situation.

24th of July of the same year, while we were still having arguments with the HR, a 30 years old Ukrainian died on a quiet part of the Danube in Vienna. It took the police and firefighters with rescue divers and drone operated thermal cameras 15h to find the body. Irony of fate, 25th of July is the world drowning prevention day.

Safety first, pride second. Stay safe, stay alive.

I steep and filter an excessive amount of cold brew for my beloved addict. I have a local roaster so I buy fresh beans. I have a little 1cup grinder and it's creating a choke point in an otherwise therapeutic process of grind, pour, cold steep, filter, and either serving or saving for later.

I am looking for a grinder that can handle 1-5lbs of beans. Can grind to a desired size, specifically 1cup of cold brew grounds. A funnel or otherwise spout that can directly pour into a mason jar. A reciver space that can handle a 4 cup (32 fl oz) volume mason jar. 

My thinking is that I can grind the grounds directly into the Mason jar, add water and steep. This will cut out several repetitive steps, streamline the process, and make less work for me.

This is my gateway grinder. So I'm not looking for something extreme, but I'm curious and interested in all options that could accomidate my needs.

1k9yksl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceHeaters101/comments/1k9yksl/could_vornado_avh2_space_heater_review_be_your/,Could Vornado AVH2 Space Heater Review Be Your Best Winter Heating Solution?,"Testing out the **Vornado EH1-0149-06 AVH2 Advanced Whole Room Heater** felt like stepping into a warm cocoon during winter. This compact yet powerful heater has become a staple in my household, especially when temperatures take a nosedive. Featuring the brand's trusted Vortex Heat Circulation¬Æ technology, it evenly warms up small to medium-sized rooms without blasting intense, uncomfortable heat. As someone who works from home in a drafty office, having a device that creates uniform warmth is both a relief and a necessity.

Daily use revealed some interesting quirks and highlights about this heater. Its dimensions, a modest 9.2‚Äù x 11.7‚Äù x 11.9‚Äù, mean it doesn‚Äôt dominate floor space, fitting comfortably under desks or in the corner of a room. My cat immediately claimed this heater as her new throne, sitting contentedly nearby as it worked its magic. For anyone with pets or kids, the tip-over protection and cool-touch case are huge peace-of-mind features. I tested it by ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù bumping it, and sure enough, it shut itself off instantly to prevent any mishaps.

**Highlights**

- Efficiently warms rooms up to 250 square feet using Vortex Heat Circulation¬Æ.  
- Dual heat settings and additional fan-only mode offer customizable use.  
- Auto climate control adjusts dynamically to maintain your desired temperature.  
- Includes safety features like a cool-touch exterior and automatic shut-off.  

[Check Vornado EH1-0149-06 price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b08hspx7xt/)

**Ease of Use**

Operating this heater is as straightforward as pouring morning coffee. The push-button controls and digital display are intuitive, making settings easy to adjust even without looking at the manual. While the timer feature (ranging from 1 to 12 hours) initially struck me as unnecessary, it turned out to be a game-changer. I set it to shut off automatically before bedtime, and it worked flawlessly every time. For such a compact product, it‚Äôs jam-packed with thoughtful features that prove its designers had real users in mind.

For those wondering about upkeep, it‚Äôs one of the simplest heaters to deal with. A quick hand-wash of the exterior every so often keeps it looking fresh, although my experience found dust accumulation minimal, likely due to its black color camouflaging it.

**Areas for Improvement**

Despite its prowess in heating efficiency and safety, there are a few areas where this device comes up short:  

- Limited to indoor use, which may disappoint those looking for more versatile options.  
- The power cord could be longer to provide greater placement flexibility.  
- Noise level during fan operation is noticeable in extremely quiet environments.  

**Competing Brands**

When comparing this model to competing heaters like the Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater and Honeywell HeatGenius, a few crucial differences stand out. The Lasko delivers comparable heating power but lacks the auto climate control that optimizes the Vornado for energy efficiency. Honeywell‚Äôs offering, meanwhile, features a broader range of programmable settings but loses points for portability. The Vornado EH1-0149-06 excels because of its thoughtful design, safety features, and compact build that prioritizes ease of use. However, the noise level during extended fan use might make the Honeywell the better choice for those particularly sensitive to background hum.

**Bang for the Buck**

Assessing the value of this heater boils down to its feature set versus alternatives. You‚Äôre paying for more than warmth‚Äîit‚Äôs the peace of mind brought on by its safety features, the convenience of low-maintenance upkeep, and the comfort of consistent room temperatures. While other models in its category offer cheaper price points, they seldom provide the same level of reliability and intelligent features like auto climate control. I‚Äôve tested cheaper products before, and you really do get what you pay for here. If quality, durability, and energy efficiency resonate with you, this heater is worth every penny.

Waking up in a small apartment with counter space at a premium can be a challenge, and this is where the Mr. Coffee 2191951 Programmable Coffee Maker shines. Its compact footprint surprised me; it's the kind of coffee machine that snugly fits even in tiny kitchen corners or on overcrowded counters. Measuring just 7.1""D x 9.65""W x 10.63""H, it's smaller than many of those bulky coffee makers that feel overwhelming in smaller kitchens. This sleek, black design doesn‚Äôt just save space‚Äîit looks great doing it. The chrome polish details give a refined touch without being too flashy, kind of like the reserved barista in a high-end coffee shop.  

**Brew Later for Maximum Convenience**  
The ability to program the device became my favorite feature pretty quickly. Mornings can be rough; we all know the struggle of fumbling with a coffee pot half-asleep. Programming the machine the night before meant waking up to the smell of fresh coffee wafting through my apartment‚Äîa simple pleasure, but one with a huge impact on starting my day right. The 25-oz capacity was just right for two generous mugs of coffee, whether for myself or to share with a roommate.  

[Check Mr. Coffee 2191951 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b081dnwg7n/)  

**Auto Pause: Still a Lifesaver**  
This feature is one of those things you don‚Äôt realize you need until it‚Äôs part of your morning ritual. I‚Äôm someone who often can‚Äôt wait for a full pot to brew. The auto-pause functionality lets you sneak a cup mid-brew without catastrophic spills; I‚Äôve tested it multiple times and haven‚Äôt made the mess I feared. Once the coffee is poured, the brewing process resumes without skipping a beat.  

**Ergonomic Carafe and Pouring Experience**  
The carafe marks another highlight. Ergonomically designed, it has ounce measurements printed on the side‚Äîperfect for anyone obsessed with precision brewing. For me, knowing the exact amount of coffee I‚Äôm pouring has become oddly satisfying. It's also incredibly easy to pour without drips, something other machines have failed spectacularly at.  

**Energy Efficiency and Safety Features**  
Two hours after brewing a pot, the device automatically shuts off. While it sounds like a minor feature, I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve dashed out of the apartment wondering, ‚ÄúDid I leave something on?‚Äù With this feature, I haven‚Äôt once worried about forgetting to switch it off. It‚Äôs peace of mind wrapped into functionality, and I appreciated that it‚Äôs both a safety and energy-saving measure.  

**Advantages**  
- Compact, sleek design fits small spaces effortlessly.  
- Brew Later feature makes mornings hassle-free.  
- Auto-pause function prevents spills for impatient coffee enthusiasts.  
- Ergonomic carafe simplifies pouring and measuring.  
- Automatic shut-off enhances safety and energy efficiency.  

**Areas of Concern**  
While this programmable coffee maker ticks a lot of boxes, it‚Äôs not without its quirks.  

- The 25 oz. brewing capacity might feel limited for larger households.  
- If the included reusable filter isn‚Äôt cleaned thoroughly after each use, coffee grinds can sometimes seep into the pot.  
- The control buttons feel a bit basic and could benefit from a slightly more premium touch.  

**Competitive Options**  
Looking beyond this model, there are plenty of similar coffee makers out there if you're shopping for a small drip machine. The Keurig K-Mini, for example, is another space-saver that appeals to single-cup enthusiasts. But I‚Äôd argue the Mr. Coffee machine delivers a stronger value for anyone who needs more than one cup at a time without jumping into an excessive price bracket. Certain Cuisinart models, like the 4-Cup programmable variant, compete here too but lean on the pricier end. What sets this product apart, however, is its simplicity coupled with reliability‚Äîthere are no overwhelming frills, and what‚Äôs there works beautifully.  

**True Value**  
For what you‚Äôre getting, this programmable coffee maker strikes an excellent price-to-quality ratio. You‚Äôre not just paying for convenience; features like the ergonomic carafe and the automatic shut-off bring a solid blend of utility and safety. My experience with different coffee machines tells me that pricier devices don‚Äôt always deliver more functionality. This one feels like a smart investment, especially if you‚Äôre someone who appreciates fuss-free mornings.

Maybe getting this out in writing will just be therapeutic.

I'm seeing someone and we both have similar divorce histories- we were both cheated on and we both have kids. My divorce was finalized recently, her situation is a little more complicated but they haven't lived together for more than a year.

When she found out her ex was cheating, she became friends with the mistress' husband, which is totally understandable to me. They helped each other confirm things, they were going through exactly the same trauma. They were there for each other. She's said she doesn't know how she would have gotten through things without his support. And to be clear, I wasn't around at this point. We were acquaintances but not close at all.

Their friendship turned into a relationship, I'm not sure for how long but it sounded somewhat serious? They broke up, decided to remain friends, and for awhile were FwB. I'm fine with all that- no problem and everyone is entitled to their past. I totally get the connection with someone who went through trauma with you and was there for you.

Then I come along. We start dating, things are great. She disclosed all of this to me up front, and before we were exclusive she included they were FwB. That didn't last long though after we started dating. We hit it off really well and became exclusive pretty quick. We've been dating for 2-1/2 - 3 months at this point.

They have continued to maintain a friendship and I didn't have a problem with that. I don't think it's my place to tell her who to be friends with and who not to be. They'd get dinner together maybe every other week, usually on the days when our custody didn't line up because during the week we're on opposite schedules as far as custody. On one of these dates a few weeks ago he confessed he had feelings for her still. She shut him down, told me about it right away, and said there was no question in her mind that she wanted to be with me.

Alright, I'm still OK at this point with the relationship. She's been very transparent with me and told me all of this stuff immediately, constantly reassuring me. And at this point I don't have hard feelings towards the guy- he shot his shot, got turned down, we move on. At this point I tell her I'm cool with everything but that I am starting to feel some feelings about the whole thing. Mainly that I'm cool with them being friends, talking from time to time, etc., but as far as when they go out together I think my discomfort is coming from the fact that they do date-like things- 1-on-1 dinner and drinks after, going to a comedy show or something similar. I'd feel more comfortable if they did more friend-type stuff- grabbing coffee or lunch maybe?

I'm still not laying down any hard lines but just sharing my feelings because she asked and I told her I'd be honest. She's good with all of this. They go out again, and again on a night when I can't be around, so it's not like she's choosing him over me or anything. But now AGAIN he tries to win her over, confesses his feelings, all the things he'd do for her, etc. She shuts him down and tells me about it again. Now I'm kind of annoyed. Like the first time I get, but the second time it feels like someone is trying to break up our relationship. When she shuts him down he basically gives her an ultimatum- if we can't be together I don't think we can be friends, we need to take time apart. She's hurt but OK with this, tells him to do what he needs to do.

Well the time apart lasts about a week. He calls again, it's his bday soon and asks if she'll go to dinner with him. I'm not excited about this, it kind of goes against the whole ""alright, I'm cool if you see each other but I'd prefer non-date-like events"" but, to be fair, I never drew a hard line there. We talked about it, I can tell this friendship is important to her. I end up telling her, look, go get dinner. It's a special occasion, I get it, I appreciate how reassuring you're being and I respect your friendship and that it's important to you.

She has been NOTHING but reassuring to me. She told me that the moment I feel strongly about this guy or if my feelings are affecting *our* relationship, then all I need to do is say the word and she'll end it, no question asked. She says all of the right things, I really couldn't ask for more.

I just can't help but feel some kind of way about all of this. I trust her, that's not the question. I know she isn't going to ""accidentally"" get physical with him. I think what bothers me more is the potential emotional connection, the fact that spending time and talking with someone like this creates some kind of intimacy regardless, and maybe some of this is just my insecurity from being cheated on in my last relationship. It's like if something *IS* going to happen, it's going to happen with someone you started as friends with, already spend time with, already have a connection with, etc. I feel secure in the relationship right now, but I guess I think about what about a year from now, 2 years from now? What about the first time we have a big fight and she's pissed at me. It feels weird having some guy in the wings who I know has feelings for her and wants more from their relationship.

But I'm not sure what to *do* about it. And she's expressed the same feelings- she hears me, my feelings are valid, but she's not sure what I'm asking her to actually do. And I don't know how to answer that. What's fair? Their friendship predates me. It's important to her. He was there during a crucial and very difficult phase of her life that would have been much harder to get through without his friendship. I'm really torn here because to be honest I can't help but feel some feelings every time I hear about this guy or the fact that they're spending time together. It bothers me to picture them at a nice restaurant 1-on-1 without me there, but I also get that they're 1-on-1 because he lives further away so there isn't like an overlap of mutual friends- their only connection is that their spouses cheated with each other.

I do not want to be controlling. I want to be respectful. I want her to have her own life outside of our relationship and to maintain relationships that are important to her. But it feels a little weird that one of these relationships is with an ex who still has feelings for her.

I'm sorry this turned into a novel, I appreciate it if you've made it this far and I can answer questions in the comments. I'd appreciate any outside perspectives here.",2,1745854544.0,AmIOverreacting,10,1.0,False
1k9yik9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k9yik9/aitah_if_i_am_just_sick_and_tired_of_my_wifes/,AITAH if I am just sick and tired of my wife's career pivot?,"Looking for advice mostly.

I (44M)'ve been married to my wife (43F) for just around 11 years and together for 13. When my wife was on maternity leave after the birth of my first daughter, she decided she no longer wanted to be a teacher and academic, she wanted to follow in the footsteps of some of her relatives and become a lawyer.  My daughter is now almost 9 and my wife still has no firm career path, and I'm increasingly feeling totally unsympathetic and uninterested.

You can browse my post history (this is a burner account) but it has been crisis mode almost every day for *years* and I'm totally burnt out.  She did 3 years of law school (while also teaching nights) and I stepped up in a big way, cooking most nights, taking care of our 3 kids (2 very young) cooking all meals, doing all bedtimes and dishes and the usual domestic stuff at least 5 days out of 7, sometimes all 7.  Weekends often as not she'd be like 'I'm studying, can you keep the kids out of our room?' and she'd disappear for half or even the entire day, not participating (or even eating). We'd fight constantly that her work load (both her full time student course load, or her actual teaching workload) was too high and I was burning out feeling like a single parent. The fights would always devolve into her telling me I wasn't supporting her while she fulfilled her dreams which always drove me crazy as I was the one shouldering all the home stuff she no longer felt she needed to do. 

On a side note I was noticing she was so distracted by things like making clothing purchases online and then returning the entire order, either out of regret or need or no longer wanting the items.  One time after deciding she hated our dining table she bought a second one and then a THIRD one from FB Marketplace, and, while pregnant, she effectively 'snuck' both of them into our garage to be discovered by me later.  One of those is still in our garage, *since moving into our new house,* entirely unused.

She is also extremely emotional, with every poor grade or career setback (in the career she is LEAVING) putting her in days of tears.  During her period studying for the bar exam, she got pregnant, which she was convinced was a miscarriage (despite doctors and sonogram technicians telling her to wait and see), and she spent an entire month, morning noon and night, berating me for not helping her find an abortion clinic and not understanding her torment when I also suggested she wait and see.  Lo and behold the baby was totally healthy but of course we spent the next 9 months in crisis mode over every other worry she had, and she failed the bar exam.  The birth of our third child was \*not\* a magical event, as you can imagine.  It felt much more like a black cloud that only slowly lifted over years and years...

As if we weren't burnt out enough, during this period my wife took other side jobs for more money and inevitably would get fired or forced to resign after a short while and again, there would be tears and screaming.  I have to note that I make good money and we both had a lot of savings we brought into the relationship, so we are incredibly fortunate and have a mortgage on a lovely home.  We also live in a country with a full year of maternity leave and decent paternity leave support as well.  We are \*so\* lucky, but she is always in scramble mode.  

Maybe this is petty and unrelated, but she is also very controlling of finances, a friend of mine was doing our taxes at a good rate and she was so demanding of answers about every possible detail I eventually had to tell the friend it was too uncomfortable to stay with him, so now we have a new accountant who is more expensive and magically my wife has no questions for them.  Anytime I make even a 7 dollar purchase on our CC she makes a comment like 'oh, let's try and watch our purchases', while she can spend 7 dollars on coffee without batting an eye.  I get it, we keep our belts tight because of her career change, but it doesn't seem balanced at all on that front.

A couple of years ago, after the second round of bar school and bar exam (and after feeling like she did so poorly on the final exam that she phoned me and told me she didn't want to live anymore and HUNG UP and wouldn't answer me), she passed the exam.  This was of course requiring every evening studying, weekends away studying, just generally she vanished from my life while I took care of home stuff.  Then she did her internship, which again was more misery.  

Despite working at an office a 5 minute drive away and a 20 minute walk, she had problem after problem because her boss would make pointed feedback (see above about her getting fired from multiple jobs in past years, I have to say my faith in her actually doing good work is... low) she'd be in tears weekly, and despite her boss giving her regular good performance reviews, she went on a 'job hunt' again (keep in mind, this is a 6 month internship), and found another place.  To say her boss was stunned is an understatement and of course lead to more recrimination, and if I may add, while the new place she found is clearly lower stakes and nicer, she did have to work a couple of extra months because of effectively restarting her internship.

She's completed that now.  She will be sworn in at the end of next month.  She's already upset that she's interviewed in a few places for full time jobs and nobody is offering much money.  I am so incredibly not enthusiastic about it.  I feel like we both sacrificed for 8 years for basically no gain, and in a pretty rough economy to say the least.  She's going to be teaching at her old job again all summer in the evening, so I'm home alone with babies doing it all over again.  She wants me to be proud of her, in fact she's angry and again telling me how unsupportive I am (and I've overheard her tell her friends the same, about how awesome she is that she 'pulled this off' with a career and a family and a pregnancy in between, and how I'm inadequately thrilled for her), and I just do my best to fake some enthusiasm.

I just know it's not over.  The crying and criticism and feeling like we're maxed out all the time will never end. Help me... advice, or tell me I did a good job, or I suck, I dunno. I miss having anything to look forward to when my work day is over other than more chores, more bedtimes, more lunches to pack while my wife works on resumes or calls her friends to complain. I am absolutely not some misogynist who just wants his wife to live in the kitchen.  I am absolutely not some monster who wants to cage his spouse and force her to stay in a career she doesn't enjoy. I miss my partner who made my life easier, not harder.  



Note1: I have a full time job in the software business. Before 2020, I would arrive at the office late and leave early every day to make sure the kids daycare pickups were covered, and dinner was ready, etc etc. After Covid, I have been basically full time work-from-home which again is so, so lucky, because I can do dinner prep and collect the kids from the school bus and tidy up and get house things done during the day, but it is of course distracting, and I know in my heart I am not giving work my best. You better believe my career has suffered in all this. 

Note2: When my wife was pregnant and laying into me how unsupportive I was, I made a suicide attempt a couple of years ago.  I spent a harrowing night at the local mental hospital emergency room and I am committed to not getting back to such a dark place again, with therapy and some medication and regular check-ins with a doctor.  When my wife lays into me about how I have let her down, I used to dislike myself so much.  Now when she does it, I just don't like \*her\*.  ",3,1745854542.0,AITAH,16,0.71,False

Just wanted to post my progress so far and I‚Äôm honestly super proud of myself for sticking to my goals. This group has really helped me tremendously. 

I honestly had no idea how to lose weight before and was completely overwhelmed. I would go all day without eating and then binge at night and wonder why I was gaining so much weight LOL. I think I was in denial for a long time. I WFH and would only average about 2-3k steps a day. I had no energy at all and felt like shit all the time. Just taking the trash out had me out of breath. I was just stuck in a really bad rut I guess. 

I researched calorie counting, I wanted to lose weight but the right way. I had an ED in HS and in my early 20‚Äôs and I absolutely did not want to go down that road again. I found a lot of great videos on tik tok that helped me a lot lol. Used the TDEE calculator to figure out my calories and learned about how important protein is. I try to get 130grams of protein but sometimes I get less I try to keep it at least 100 though. I didn‚Äôt want to do a diet where I would gain all the weight back so my goal was to just prioritize protein and stay under my calorie budget while still eating things I like. I will still have a sweet treat at night but instead of a piece of cake I will eat a choboni yogurt flip or a barbell protein bar. Instead of my heavy cream and sugar loaded mid day iced coffee I will just use a protein shake and espresso powder for my iced coffee. 

I bought a walking pad for work and when I watch tv and made a goal of 10k steps a day. I have been hitting my goal everyday except for a few days I was sick. 

I have so much more energy now  I actually don‚Äôt feel like shit all the time anymore. I tried on some clothes yesterday and when I looked at myself in the mirror I didn‚Äôt hate myself and was able to wear a medium! 

I still have more weight to lose and I want to eventually start lifting weights. Just wanted to share my progress because it feels good to talk about it lol. I want to thank everyone who post here because your posts really do help a lot.

Hey everyone,
I run a big authorized car service station in India. We‚Äôre focused on low pricing, honest service, and a comfortable experience. We don‚Äôt sell unnecessary upsells like dealerships do . 

We even offer unlimited free samosas, chai, and coffee to all waiting customers ‚Äî but somehow, people still prefer main dealerships, even though:

‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†They charge 20‚Äì30% more for basic services.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†They aggressively upsell unnecessary extras (doubling the bill easily).

We pride ourselves on being straightforward and ethical, but sometimes I feel disappointed ‚Äî like maybe people prefer being sold ‚Äúfancy‚Äù packages instead of real value?

Where I Need Help:
- How can I improve the customer experience even more, so people feel they are getting something better than a dealership?
- What can I change in perception/branding without being sneaky or dishonest?
- How can I attract more customers and still stay profitable at honest prices?

I believe good work should win eventually but after spending more people feel more satisfied with perceived value

1k9yc9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k9yc9m/could_the_mr_coffee_programmable_5cup_coffee/,Could the Mr. Coffee Programmable 5-Cup Coffee Maker review change your mornings?,"The Mr. Coffee 2191951, officially known as the Mr. Coffee Programmable Coffee Maker, 5 Cups with Auto Pause, truly had me intrigued. I didn‚Äôt expect a coffee maker designed for smaller spaces to hold up well to daily use, especially since I drink coffee religiously every morning, but this compact dripping wonder had a few surprises in store. It does exactly what a coffee maker should do‚Äîdeliver a fresh, hot cup of coffee‚Äîwithout the unnecessary gizmos that typically complicate my bleary-eyed mornings. While it‚Äôs far from perfect, there‚Äôs a lot to like about this modest machine. Let me dive into what my experience has been over the past several weeks.  

**Design and Build**  
This coffee maker is compact, and I mean really compact. Measuring just 7.1 inches deep, 9.65 inches wide, and 10.63 inches tall, it lives up to its promise of fitting snugly into small kitchens. Since I have limited counter space, this was an immediate win for me. It features a classic design with a black and chrome exterior that looks decent, though far from luxurious. The carafe is a manageable size, designed to brew 25 ounces at once, which translates to two 12-ounce cups‚Äîa nice fit for someone who doesn‚Äôt need to chug caffeine by the gallon. The ounce markings on the carafe are surprisingly helpful for precise measurement, something I appreciated while fumbling to make my midday cup.

**Ease of Use**  
I tested its programmable features extensively, as I enjoy dorm-style laziness when it comes to morning tasks. It has a ‚Äúbrew later‚Äù function that lets you program your coffee the night before. Waking up to the smell of brewing coffee is a simple joy, and this machine nailed it every time. The auto-pause feature was another highlight; I could grab a cup mid-brew without triggering a mess‚Äîthough I would advise doing so quickly as some minor dripping still occurs. The button-based interface couldn‚Äôt have been simpler, though it did feel a bit dated in a world dominated by sleek touch controls.  

[Check Mr. Coffee 2191951 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b081dnwg7n/)  

**Advantages**  
- Compact size makes it ideal for small kitchens, dorm rooms, or even office cubicles.  
- The programmable ‚Äúbrew later‚Äù feature adds convenience for busy mornings.  
- Auto shut-off after two hours ensures safety and energy efficiency.  

**Performance**  
As a basic coffee maker, it performs well enough. The taste of the coffee exceeded my expectations, likely due to its filtration system and reusable filter. It even felt environmentally conscious not having to rely on disposable filters. Brewing took about 6-8 minutes, which is standard for drip machines in this class. The coffee stayed warm in the carafe for over an hour before beginning to lose temperature, which is honestly acceptable for a budget coffee maker like this. However, it struggles to keep the coffee piping hot compared to higher-end models with thermal carafes.  

**Downsides**  
- The included carafe feels flimsy and easy to break if handled roughly.  
- Slight dripping can occur during the pour-even-with-auto-pause mechanism.  
- Limited brewing capacity might not be ideal for households with multiple coffee drinkers.  

**Competing Products**  
Let‚Äôs talk competition because there‚Äôs plenty out there. For instance, the Black+Decker 5-Cup Coffeemaker offers a similar size and programming features but lacks the reusable filter that this model provides. Meanwhile, the Keurig K-Mini shines for single servings but doesn‚Äôt provide auto-shutoff or programmability, sacrificing convenience for speed. The Mr. Coffee model wins when it comes to offering essential features at a much friendlier price point. However, it doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to premium machines like the Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker, which offers more versatility and performance at a significantly higher price.  

**Smart Spending**  
At its current price range, this coffee machine delivers decent value without bells and whistles. For coffee enthusiasts who want something reliable without breaking the bank, it‚Äôs a reasonable choice. You won‚Äôt get the fancy brewing options or milk frothers that come with premium models, but for straightforward coffee-making, it‚Äôs worth considering if space and budget are your priorities.

1k9yaye,https://i.redd.it/kiinxygcglxe1.jpeg,[Whiskey Review #121] The Dalmore 12 Sherry Cask Select,"The Dalmore isn't the kind of brand I usually buy. Not because it's bad, because it really isn't. It simply caters to a target style and budget that I'm not included in. The Dalmore aims to be a similar version of The Macallan, with relatively high price compared to other whiskies of the same age, but with very well-designed bottles and the silver stag that really stands out in any bar.

This Sherry Cask Select version was released in 2020, intended to remain a version aged exclusively in ex-sherry casks, while the original is aged in a combination of ex-sherry and ex-bourbon. The labels are very similar, with only the color tones varying; the original ranges from burgundy to red, while this one varies from lilac to purple.

The label also mentions that it is finished in ex-Oloroso sherry casks, but after a little research I discovered that this finish is actually a combination of American and European casks from three different Andalusian cooperages (Tevasa, Vasyma, Paez), which previously contained a blend of Oloroso sherry and Pedro Xim√©nez.

Therefore, its aging takes place in ex-bourbon barrels for 10 years and is then finished for 2 years in these ex-sherry barrels and finally bottled at 43% ABV.

Made by: Dalmore Distillery  
Name of the whisky: 12 Year Old Sherry Cask Select  
Brand:  The Dalmore  
Origin: Highlands  
Age: 12 years  
Price: $90

**Nose:** Although it's finished in ex-sherry casks, that finish is two years long, so it makes sense that the nose is intense with aromas of raisins and plums, with plenty of cherries and chocolate, and softer notes of toffee and coffee beans. After a few minutes, there are also aromas of orange peel.

**Palate:** On the palate, the flavors are relatively sweet and lack the astringent note of other sherry-aged whiskeys. Honey and orange peel are the main notes, but also cherries and chocolate cake, and toward the finish, spicier notes of black pepper, cinnamon, and cloves.

**Retrohale/Finish:** Notes of coffee beans, orange peel and a balsamic hint.

**Rating:** 6 on the t8ke

**Conclusion:** While I'm not generally a fan of The Dalmore, I liked this one. The fact that it's primarily an ex-bourbon whisky aged in ex-sherry casks doesn't make it a sherry-bomb, but rather a whisky with some sherry notes. Its price isn't outrageous, but it's a whisky you might appreciate if you like The Dalmore's style. However, if you're looking for something with a greater sherry influence, there are other places (and budgets) where you can get better.

1k9yafj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Icecream101/comments/1k9yafj/black_cherry_ice_cream_recipe_dark_fruity/,Black Cherry Ice Cream Recipe (Dark & Fruity),"Crafting the Perfect Black Cherry Ice Cream Recipe: Ingredients and Techniques for a Dark &amp; Fruity Delight
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Choosing the Right Black Cherries for Rich Flavor

When aiming for that perfect dark and fruity black cherry ice cream, the first step lies in selecting the best cherries. Fresh, ripe black cherries tend to have a deep color and a rich, sweet-tart flavor profile that immensely boosts the cream‚Äôs complexity. If fresh cherries aren‚Äôt in season, frozen black cherries can be an excellent alternative, as they are often picked and frozen at peak ripeness, retaining most of their natural flavors.

For this recipe, look for cherries labeled as ‚Äúblack cherries‚Äù or ‚Äúsweet cherries,‚Äù which offer the bold fruitiness that stands up beautifully against the creamy base. Avoid sour cherries unless you prefer an intensely tart twist, as these can overpower the delicate balance of the ice cream.

### Ingredients That Make This Ice Cream Shine

Creating a dark, fruity black cherry ice cream requires thoughtful ingredient selection. Here‚Äôs a quick list to keep on hand:

- **Whole Milk and Heavy Cream:** Combining these gives the right creamy texture without overwhelming sweetness.
- **Granulated Sugar:** Sweetens the base evenly, allowing the cherry flavor to shine through.
- **Pure Vanilla Extract:** Adds subtle warmth, enhancing the natural cherry tones.
- **Fresh or Frozen Black Cherries:** The star ingredient, contributing both color and deep fruity richness.
- **Lemon Juice:** A splash brightens the cherries, balancing richness.
- **Optional Dark Chocolate Chips or Chunks:** For a layer of decadent contrast to the fruitiness.
 
These ingredients combined with simple techniques create an indulgent ice cream that‚Äôs dark in color and rich with complex fruity notes.

### Extracting Maximum Cherry Flavor with Minimal Effort

One key to crafting a standout black cherry ice cream is how you prepare the cherries before adding them to your base. Start by gently pitting and halving fresh cherries. Then, simmer them with a bit of sugar and lemon juice on low heat until they release their juices and soften. This not only intensifies their flavor but also makes sure the fruit will meld smoothly into the ice cream.

If you prefer texture, hold back some cherries and fold them in after the base is churned. This gives delightful bursts of real fruit in every bite while maintaining that deep cherry richness throughout the cream.

### Perfecting the Ice Cream Base for Creamy Texture

To complement the bold cherry notes, the ice cream‚Äôs base should be smooth and luscious with a velvety mouthfeel. Heat the milk, cream, and sugar slowly to dissolve sugar completely, stirring often. Add vanilla extract once the base is off the heat to preserve its fragrant qualities.

For those looking to add luxurious creaminess, a small amount of egg yolk can be tempered and gently cooked into the mixture to create a custard-style ice cream. This adds body and richness without masking the fruitiness of the cherries.

### Churning Tips for Ideal Consistency

Once your black cherry mixture is ready and chilled, it‚Äôs time to churn. An ice cream maker is your best friend here, ensuring air is incorporated evenly for that perfect scoopable texture. Churn according to your machine‚Äôs instructions until the mixture thickens just right.

If you‚Äôre adding chocolate chips or reserved cherries, fold them in gently after churning but before freezing solid. This keeps the pieces intact and evenly distributed, enhancing every mouthful.

### Final Touches for Serving and Storing

After churning and adding mix-ins, transfer the ice cream to a sealed container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours to allow flavors to meld and the texture to fully develop. When ready to serve, let the ice cream soften slightly at room temperature for a few minutes ‚Äî this helps release the dark, fruity aroma and makes scooping easier.

Store any leftovers tightly sealed in the freezer to maintain freshness and prevent ice crystals. Black cherry ice cream tastes even better a day or two after preparation, as time deepens the fruity intensity.

### Experimenting with Flavors and Textures

Once you‚Äôve mastered the classic black cherry ice cream, feel free to experiment with variations. Adding a splash of cherry brandy or a hint of almond extract can highlight the cherry‚Äôs natural flavors. For texture enthusiasts, swirl in a cherry compote or dark chocolate fudge for dynamic layers.

Try using different types of cherries to find your favorite taste balance or combine black cherries with other berries for a mixed fruit sensation. The dark and fruity profile of black cherry ice cream lends itself well to creative twists, turning simple ingredients into a gourmet treat.

With these ingredients and techniques, you‚Äôll craft a homemade black cherry ice cream that‚Äôs rich, indulgent, and bursting with authentic dark fruit flavor. This delightful frozen dessert is sure to impress family and friends whether served casually or for a special occasion.

</div>Creative Serving Ideas and Pairings to Elevate Your Black Cherry Ice Cream Experience
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unique Twists to Serve Black Cherry Ice Cream

Black cherry ice cream offers a rich, dark, and fruity flavor that deserves to be highlighted with creative serving ideas. When you elevate the presentation and pairings, the dessert transforms from simply tasty to unforgettable. To bring out the best characteristics of black cherry ice cream, consider serving it in ways that engage multiple senses and enhance the complex, fruity notes.

One simple yet elegant way is to serve a scoop of black cherry ice cream in chilled black cherry or dark chocolate bowls. The cold bowls keep the ice cream colder for longer while adding a subtle fruity and bitter crunch that complements the ice cream's sweetness. For an added twist, sprinkle crushed pistachios on top‚Äîthis provides a crunchy texture contrast and a slight savory edge, making every bite interesting.

### Decadent Dessert Pairings to Try

Pairing black cherry ice cream with complementary desserts can turn your treat into a gourmet experience. Here are some creative pairings that will excite your palate:

- **Warm Chocolate Brownies:** The deep cocoa notes of fudgy brownies pair perfectly with the tangy and rich flavor of black cherry ice cream. A warm brownie topped with a scoop of black cherry ice cream creates a delicious contrast between warm and cold, soft and creamy sensations.
- **Almond or Walnut Biscotti:** These crunchy, nutty cookies offer a nice texture against the smoothness of the ice cream. Dipping biscotti into a bowl of black cherry ice cream creates a delightful combination of nuttiness and fruity coolness.
- **Spiced Pound Cake:** The subtle spices, such as cinnamon or nutmeg, in pound cake enhance the fruity depth of black cherry ice cream. Layer slices of pound cake and dollops of ice cream for a stunning trifle-style dessert presentation.

### Elevate with Sauces and Toppings

Great toppings and sauces make any ice cream more exciting. With black cherry flavors, choosing the right additions can highlight its dark fruit essence while adding layers of sweetness and texture.

‚Äã Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ‚Äã  
  
**Homemade Black Cherry Sauce** is a fantastic option for drizzling over your ice cream. By simmering fresh or frozen black cherries with a touch of sugar and lemon juice, you get a luscious sauce that intensifies the cherry flavor. Pour it over your black cherry ice cream to add moisture and a slightly tart burst in every bite.

Alternatively, a rich balsamic glaze offers a surprising yet harmonious pairing. The vinegar's acidity cuts through the creamy ice cream, heightening the dark cherry‚Äôs natural sweetness.

For crunch, try these toppings:

- Toasted coconut flakes
- Dark chocolate shavings or mini chips
- Candied ginger pieces
- Chopped pecans or hazelnuts

### Creative Presentation Ideas to Impress Guests

2. **Layered Parfaits:** Layer black cherry ice cream with granola, fresh berries, and whipped cream in clear glasses. This creates a multi-textured dessert that looks as good as it tastes.
3. **Fruit Bowls:** Hollow out fresh dark cherries or even ripe plums and fill them with a small scoop of ice cream. This unique edible bowl adds surprise and elegance to your serving method.

### Pairing Drinks with Black Cherry Ice Cream

The rich and fruity profile of black cherry ice cream offers outstanding opportunities for thoughtful drink pairings. Whether serving friends or indulging on a quiet evening, these beverages complement the flavor perfectly:

- **Port Wine:** The sweetness and complexity of a tawny port echo the dark cherry‚Äôs fruity notes wonderfully. Serve a small glass alongside a bowl of ice cream for a refined taste experience.
- **Espresso or Black Coffee:** The bold bitterness of coffee contrasts nicely with the smooth, sweet ice cream. Try pouring a shot of espresso over black cherry ice cream to create an adult-style affogato.
- **Cherry-Infused Sparkling Water:** A light, refreshing choice that complements without overpowering the ice cream‚Äôs richness. Garnish with a twist of lemon or mint for extra flair.

With these ideas, you can transform a simple scoop of black cherry ice cream into a memorable dessert adventure. Whether through creative presentation, thoughtful pairings, or complementary drinks, your black cherry ice cream experience can become dark, fruity, and irresistibly sophisticated. Experiment with these suggestions and discover what combinations delight you the most!

### Conclusion

By carefully selecting quality ingredients like ripe black cherries and balancing them with creamy, natural bases, you can craft a dessert that bursts with deep, tangy flavor and silky texture.

Once you‚Äôve mastered the recipe, don‚Äôt stop there. Serving your black cherry ice cream with thoughtful pairings can transform a simple scoop into an impressive dessert experience.

A bit about me: (39) I enjoy a good book (Kurt Vonnegut is my favourite author, but I like classics as well) and a good political discussion. Any discussion really. As the username suggests, I love cycling - but I am not very fast, I prefer the slow but steady approach of cycle touring. Pre pregnancy I went out a lot and went to Techno festivals. Hands down favourite festival is fusion. 

I don't care if you are male or female and how old you are if we can have a good chat, that's awesome. I speak German, English and Russian.

The approach centres on determining K-Factor values for mineral salts for a given TDS meter (calibrated to the 442 scale) and using those values to create brew water mineral concentrates for coffee.

Regional Variants ideas I came up with are: Unovan Dachsbun based on Bagels, Unovan Sinistea based on Starbucks Coffee and a new Regional Evolution called Coffeegeist. We already got a convergent with Poltchageist and Sinistcha so it makes sense to have a regional form next for the Sinistea line.

I know we already have 156 unovan pokemon but would it be funny to have even more pokemon.

For my 3rd year of university, I was assigned to a co-op placement for winter 2025 (Jan-April).

I've been going to a bunch of networking events, countless coffee chats, cold emails etc. I did get referred for a summer 2026 internship but never heard back from recruiter. 

I have only gotten one interview since January, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I have a solid resume and everything. The problem is I can‚Äôt get an interview.

Like, yeah, there were some pre-interviews I had with the recruiter. They said it's up to the hiring manager to select who they want to interview. Never got a call back.

What even sucks is that I tried connecting with a bunch of people whose roles I want to do in the future. But they‚Äôre not accepting my LinkedIn invitation. Some people I already connected with don‚Äôt even look at their LinkedIn message. 

I have a great LinkedIn profile. My coffee chats and interview skills aren‚Äôt great. But tbh, I don't know what to do.

I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm not going to get an internship for summer 2026. More importantly idk what to do this summer. 

I‚Äôm just so pissed at recruiters and alumni not responding to my messages or emails. 

All of them are perfectly tailored to them and they don‚Äôt want to give back. Like if I was working in my dream job and a student reached out to me. I don‚Äôt mind helping them out.

By the end of the review, you‚Äôll see why this machine might be an interesting addition to your kitchen, but also where it could improve.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stood out to me was the sleek and modern appearance of this portable ice maker. With its compact dimensions of 8.66 x 12.68 x 11.3 inches and a weight of just 20.9 pounds, it fits neatly on the counter without taking up too much space. The built-in handle makes it easy to move around, and I‚Äôve found it remarkably convenient when hosting backyard barbecues. Its gray finish has a subtle elegance that blends seamlessly with most kitchen decors without screaming for attention. While the overall build feels sturdy, the ice basket and scoop, though practical, feel lightweight and slightly flimsy compared to the rest of the machine.

**Performance and Ice Production Speed**  
Impressively, the machine starts producing ice in as little as seven minutes after being turned on, as long as you‚Äôve already filled the tank with water. It churns out up to 35 pounds of chewable nugget ice daily, which has proven more than enough for most occasions. During a family game night, the ice basket filled up after just a couple of hours, and the automatic pause when the basket is full was a lifesaver. However, during particularly busy events, I did notice it struggled to keep up with constant demand, especially since the ice basket only holds 1.5 pounds at a time.

**Highlights**  
- Compact design for portability and storage ease.  
- Rapid nugget ice production‚Äîready in just 7 minutes.  
- Can produce up to 35 pounds of ice per day.  
- Automatic functions stop ice making when the basket is full or when water runs low.

**Ice Quality and Usability**  
The quality of the nugget ice cubes is where this machine truly shines. Each piece is crystal clear, chewable, and retains its solid form much longer than conventional ice cubes. Whether added to cocktails, served in soda, or simply chewed straight out of the glass (yes, I‚Äôm that person), the texture is uniformly satisfying. I did a ‚Äúfancy cocktail face-off‚Äù with friends, and we all agreed the nugget ice elevated the drinks significantly. That said, cleaning the machine regularly is essential to maintain the ice‚Äôs clear aesthetic. The self-cleaning function, activated by holding the on/off button for five seconds, simplifies maintenance‚Äîbut you still need to give it a more thorough clean occasionally for peace of mind.

**Features that Impress**  
The machine‚Äôs self-cleaning capability is a game-changer for people like me, who are easily grossed out by stagnant water in appliances. Adding water, pressing a button for five seconds, and letting the machine do its thing is wonderfully straightforward. Beyond that, I mostly appreciated the smart operation‚Äîyou get notified if the basket is full or when the water is running low. This simple mechanism avoids wasted energy and ensures a smoother user experience.

**Drawbacks**  
Some aspects of the ice maker aren‚Äôt as brilliant.  
- The ice basket's 1.5-pound capacity feels underwhelming for larger gatherings.  
- The noise level during operation is noticeable, especially in quieter environments. It's not obnoxious, but you won‚Äôt miss the hum.  
- Occasionally, the machine struggles to maintain performance during prolonged use, especially during consecutive sessions without enough cooldown time.  

**Competing Products**  
Stacking the product against competitors like pebble ice machines from GE or Frigidaire brings up a deeper conversation on pricing versus features. GE‚Äôs ice maker offers larger storage and quieter operation but comes at a steeper initial cost. Frigidaire‚Äôs models are priced similarly yet lack the same portability and rapid production time AGLUCKY provides. In terms of value, this portable machine excels with its affordability and adaptability, making it a compelling option for occasional users or anyone operating within a limited space.

**Financial Value**  
For its price range, this nugget ice maker delivers an appealing balance of convenience and performance. Comparable machines often fall short in portability or speed, whereas this device ticks those boxes quite comfortably. While I wouldn't call it a budget device, the features it offers make it a smart choice for those seeking chewable ice without breaking the bank. If compact size and self-cleaning convenience are at the top of your list, it‚Äôs a great investment.

Michi glared at them all, her cheeks puffed up as her lips quivered in guilt. Behind her back, the artifact glistened with the candles. What good she was doing, hiding it behind her back. It wasn‚Äôt like Yuri and Natsuki could see it clear as a crystal.

She sighed, sidestepping so she could regard everyone. ‚ÄúYou still don‚Äôt trust me.‚Äù Not even a question on her part. 

There were a million things MC could say to that, but before he could pipe up, Natsuki snapped. ‚ÄúDid you *think* we‚Äôd trust you after what you did?‚Äù

Yuri raised a hand, ‚ÄúNatsuki, calm down.‚Äù Despite the direction, Yuri herself couldn‚Äôt seem to regard her as trustworthy either. Her eyes couldn‚Äôt stay still. 

Now that Michi had basically cornered herself, the gang came together. MC didn‚Äôt know what good he expected. He saw her rob what was supposed to be an integral artifact that the two Chibis he actually trusted were after. There wasn‚Äôt a good interpretation of those actions, that was for sure. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSheesh, if you guys really don‚Äôt believe me I‚Äôll put the artifact back like a good chibi or whatever. It‚Äôs not like the normal console is down and we can‚Äôt stay in the Inner Code without it or anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù Sayori raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúDo I need to spell it out for you? The goodie-two-socks that all of you worshipped was after this artifact in case something like this happened. Whether she planned for it to happen herself or it was just a lucky prediction is another thing, but she tried leading you to it, Sayori, so that you‚Äôd have it just in case.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ is happening, anyway? Why is the normal console down and what makes that one different?‚Äù Natsuki asked.

Michi sighed. ‚ÄúI hate infodumps.‚Äù

‚ÄúBy all means,‚Äù Yuri said, ‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course *you* want an infodump,‚Äù Natsuki murmured.

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust kidding.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen. MC, after Sunyori chased me and led Monika astray, we found the Central Console. After inspecting it, we learned the reason ordinary consoles are acting up. The transmission medium is set to text right now. And according to the system, Ordinary Console inputs don‚Äôt register or at the very least have a hard time doing it while in this format.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù MC put his hands in his pockets. ‚ÄúBut what about that console? How is it different?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an All Purpose Console. Think of it like the properties of the Central Console with portability of the Ordinary ones.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo the tl;dr is that one works even though we‚Äôre in text format,‚Äù Natsuki finished.

‚Äú...Well if you put it that way, yeah.‚Äù She cleared her throat, ‚ÄúNow, seeing as I went to the trouble of acquiring this *after* I learned of it from Monika and the owner of this Shop, do you understand that it was not out of malice or some stupid plan to escape this world again?‚Äù

The group glanced at each other uncertainly. Michi had voiced a pretty clear case for herself. Plus, MC had a funny feeling she‚Äôd already gotten a mouthful from Sunyori about the same thing. Hell, maybe any other chibis had Monika, say, knocked on the door of that one house they liked to visit for help. It didn‚Äôt really look like the others were up for it, but‚Ä¶ if Michi wasn‚Äôt lying, this was possibly the only way to get back to the Inner Code easily. It looked like it was up to him to save the situation.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúBut you better keep your word. The minute you act out of line‚Äî‚Äù

She rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúYes, yes, I get it. You‚Äôll add me to your Collection.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äî‚Äù MC sighed, ‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôll never learn.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be helped,‚Äù Sayori said, patting his shoulder, ‚ÄúYou learned that style from me. I‚Äôll say, it‚Äôs strange the chibis are spot on with our crafts.‚Äù

‚ÄúHm‚Ä¶ now that you mention it‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo time for infodumps, let‚Äôs get out of here!‚Äù Michi fully revealed the console, punching in some inputs, and suddenly the intimate candlelit coffee shop was replaced by the bright blue forest.
~~~
DEEP INTO THEIR WALK‚Ä¶
~~~
‚ÄúSheesh, these hikes take a lot out of me,‚Äù Nat huffed, ‚ÄúHow do you find the time to do this every day, Yuri?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a comfort,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not necessarily about the walk, more than the appreciation of nature. By now, I know Akemi Forest like the back of my hand.‚Äù

Nat nodded. ‚ÄúMhm, mhm. So‚Ä¶ about how we got lost earlier‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú...It happens.‚Äù

Nat giggled. ‚ÄúHuh? But you‚Äôve like, never made mistakes ever!‚Äù

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, why are you trying to place me so high on this metaphorical pedestal?‚Äù

‚ÄúI see it,‚Äù Michi cut in.

They all came together, looking up. The wormhole was difficult to see in the forest where the trees obscured much of the view, but peeking through the trees was a bright ray of sunlight. Unmistakable who it belonged to. The silhouette of a familiar bow topped chibi was behind that light.

‚ÄúCan you teleport us there?‚Äù MC asked.

‚ÄúYeah, after eating two of those cookies, the sugarcrash has lasted a while. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can walk.‚Äù

‚ÄúHm‚Ä¶‚Äù Michi thought for a bit. ‚ÄúIt looks like it‚Äôs over the Crossroads. Hold on‚Ä¶‚Äù She punched more inputs in. In the blink of an eye, they were there.

‚ÄúEveryone! Hey!‚Äù Monika said.

They all came together. ‚ÄúI am relieved you‚Äôre alright,‚Äù Yuri said.

‚ÄúMC told me you ran off suddenly. That‚Äôs so unlike you! That‚Äôs supposed to be my thing!‚Äù Sayori said, hugging her.

‚ÄúU-um, sure‚Ä¶ I guess‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you want to attribute THAT to yourself, Sayori?‚Äù MC said. She shrugged.

‚ÄúMichi,‚Äù an unfamiliar chibi said, ‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù

‚ÄúJeez, everyone and the antagonizing lately,‚Äù she came forward, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre freaking welcome.‚Äù

The chibi‚Äôs eyes lit up, ‚ÄúYou got the All Purpose Console! Great work!‚Äù

Everyone stepped back. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this?‚Äù Nat asked. 

‚ÄúOh, this is Mocha!‚Äù Monika said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the owner of that coffee shop. Since you‚Äôre all together, I‚Äôm sure you met up there, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Yuri said. ‚ÄúWell, in this case, it looks like we‚Äôre all here. What are we waiting for?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing, I say.‚Äù An ethereal voice boomed overhead. They looked up. Sunyori was clear as day now, turning the deep gloomy backdrop of the wormhole into a bright splash of sunshine. ‚ÄúHowever, we can‚Äôt just pop ourselves in blindly. There are hordes of Sukimores everywhere there. We‚Äôll have to hang out near the entrance first, gauge our teleportation path.‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh, it's gonna be hard to stay sneaky with a group like this,‚Äù Nat said.

‚ÄúMaybe if we all had cardboard boxes to hide in,‚Äù MC joked.

‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt think that would work‚Ä¶‚Äù Monika eyed the wormhole tentatively.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll sit this one out,‚Äù Mocha said, ‚ÄúI pointed you to the artifact. That does not mean I‚Äôm well equipped to handle what‚Äôs up there.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs totally okay!‚Äù Monika said, ‚ÄúIn that case, I hope we‚Äôll see you again, Mocha!‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope so too.‚Äù And with that, she retreated into the trees.

‚ÄúWell, what are we waiting for? I‚Äôll send us up.‚Äù Michi once again jotted down some commands, and suddenly the lush green forest turned into the lush green 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs of the Inner Code. They were officially on the last leg.
~~~
ONE ROUTE ASSESSMENT LATER‚Ä¶
~~~
If Monika squinted just long enough, she could see the Central Console in the distance, and Natalie tauntingly behind it, just as massive as the Console. Strewn about were condensed packs of Sukimores or other Chibimores, all scanning the area for them. 

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she whispered, ‚ÄúDo we have a route? Who‚Äôs manning the Console?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat, you don‚Äôt trust me still?‚Äù Michi said.

‚ÄúN-not that, just‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs scary,‚Äù MC murmured.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you keep this up I‚Äôll teleport us right in the middle of that horde over there.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut it, you two,‚Äù Natsuki hissed, ‚ÄúWe should treat this seriously!‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs right. If we get spotted, we can‚Äôt rely on Sunyori‚Äôs attacks because they‚Äôll bounce off of them, and Sayori is still recovering from the sugarcrash,‚Äù Yuri reasoned.

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Sunyori said, ‚ÄúNow, do you see a spot we can safely go through?‚Äù

Michi scanned forward. There were two hordes nearby, but it looked like there was a blindspot between one of them and a more distant cluster. ‚ÄúThere,‚Äù she whispered, typing commands in and sending them to that location. Movement one went off without a hitch.

‚ÄúNice,‚Äù Natsuki said, ‚ÄúKeep at it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh goodness,‚Äù Sayori said, ‚ÄúThis sugarcrash and the inner code don‚Äôt mix well‚Ä¶ I feel like I‚Äôm about to‚Ä¶ throw up‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù Monika said, ‚ÄúAre you going to be okay? Will you be able to hold on until it‚Äôs over?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ know.‚Äù

‚ÄúSayori,‚Äù Yuri said, ‚ÄúBefore those two went away, didn‚Äôt they input a console command to get rid of your sugarcrash immediately?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù Sayori mulled it over, but came up with nothing but a sigh. ‚ÄúThey did but I don‚Äôt remember the input‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt should be something simple I‚Äôd assume,‚Äù Monika said.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Sunyori agreed. ‚ÄúMaybe we should find the command and blast our way to Natalie.‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh‚Ä¶‚Äù Sayori whined, ‚ÄúHurry up‚Ä¶ then‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSayori‚Ä¶‚Äù MC looked at her tentatively. Monika frowned. It must have been tough for him especially, seeing her go through things like this. And on top of what he told her earlier. She still couldn‚Äôt quite understand what he was getting at, but she knew it was probably unwise to pry. As much as she wanted to know, it was his battle, his alone.

Meanwhile, the rest of them were fussing with the console. ‚ÄúWe may just have to bail this plan and stick to being stealthy,‚Äù Michi said, ‚ÄúIf this takes too long‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHm‚Ä¶‚Äù Monika looked it over.

‚ÄúSomething like ‚ÄòRid Sayori‚Äôs sugarcrash,‚Äô?‚Äù Yuri offered.

‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not how we‚Äôre regarded in the files,‚Äù Monika said.

‚Äú‚ÄòUnsick sayorichr?‚Äô‚Äù Natsuki said.

‚ÄúNot our file type. Anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúGosh, what could it be?‚Äù Sunyori said.

‚ÄúWhat if‚Ä¶‚Äù Michi typed something in.

‚ÄúUh- no. Uh-uh, do not even finish that command,‚Äù Monika said, her voice too high.

‚ÄúWhat? It‚Äôll get rid of the problem!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll get rid of WAY more than the problem!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can just recover her!‚Äù

‚ÄúI refuse!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one holding the console here, you don‚Äôt get to refuse jack!‚Äù Michi yelled.

‚ÄúYou two, too loud!‚Äù Yuri said.

Suddenly the console was hoisted away, now in Sunyori‚Äôs hands. She quickly deleted the unfinished command. ‚ÄúThere, that solves the problem. Now quiet down‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIntruders! Over here!‚Äù

‚ÄúShoot,‚Äù Monika sighed. The Sukimores were going to have to be dealt with alongside Natalie, so it seemed. She looked at Sunyori. ‚ÄúJust bring us to Natalie. We‚Äôll deal with them as they come.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll deal with them fast, right?‚Äù Sayori whined. ‚ÄúGuh‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I can hold on‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a little more, Sayori,‚Äù Monika said. ‚ÄúSunyori, go on.‚Äù

Quickly, she typed in the command‚Ä¶

They said life begins at forty. I don‚Äôt know who ‚Äúthey‚Äù are, but I suspect they didn‚Äôt have a stack of unfinished manuscripts, a laptop with more coffee stains than RAM, and a heart bruised from love and rejection letters. And yet‚Ä¶ here I am. Forty.¬†*Cuatro d√©cadas*. A number that feels like a chapter title‚Äîbold, inevitable, humming with narrative weight. Not quite the climax, but far enough from the beginning that the prologue feels like someone else‚Äôs book entirely.

I started with rhyme. A boy in a small town in Mexico, scribbling verses at the kitchen table while my mother stirred something soulful on the stove. Poetry was my first rebellion‚Äîmy way of turning silence into music. Later came the fiction, the horror, the dark corners of the human psyche I couldn‚Äôt resist exploring. I never wanted to just¬†*tell*¬†stories. I wanted to¬†*bleed*¬†them. Back then, I thought being a writer was about mystery and solitude. Now I know it‚Äôs about clarity and connection.

Somewhere between those first rhymes and today, I became an insurance agent‚Äîlife‚Äôs twisty like that. But you know what? Sitting across from people, listening to their fears, hopes, and messy human details they rarely admit, turned out to be training. For empathy. For character development. For writing people who feel like people. I used to think success meant publishing a bestseller. Now I think it means writing something honest‚Äîsomething that makes someone pause mid-scroll and whisper, ‚ÄúDamn. That‚Äôs me.‚Äù

I‚Äôve wrestled with rejection, with impostor syndrome, with the bitter taste of comparison. But I‚Äôve also held my own words in my hands‚Äî*Musas Imaginarias*¬†(an unpublished collection of poems), short stories like¬†[Obsessed](https://www.amazon.com/Possessed-Short-Story-gabriel-lucatero-ebook/dp/B00Y1QQVDE?ref_=ast_author_dp), articles that trace my love for writers like King, and essays born from midnight thoughts and caf√© confessions. Some days, it feels like I‚Äôm still at square one. Other days, I remember: square one is where all the magic starts.

[The memoirs](https://gabriellucatero.com/blog/private-memoirs-s1/)¬†are still brewing‚Äîquietly, insistently. Not because I think I‚Äôm famous enough to write one, but because I believe in documenting the human condition. Especially the parts we‚Äôre not proud of. The lust, the guilt, the ache of almosts. The way a woman can walk into your life when you least expect it and turn your truths into poems. The way pain sometimes makes better sentences than peace. These memoirs won‚Äôt be clean or chronological. They‚Äôll be raw and full of detours‚Äîlike me. They‚Äôll talk about heartbreak, ghosts, and what it means to try again even when the ink runs dry.

So what does it mean to turn forty as a writer who‚Äôs still chasing the dream? It means owning the long game. It means celebrating progress that can‚Äôt always be measured in book deals or followers. It means looking back with tenderness and forward with fire. I‚Äôm not done. Not even close. If anything, I‚Äôm just now starting to understand the kind of writer I am: one who blends Spanish with sarcasm, poetry with plot, and humor with heartbreak. One who sees the world not in black and white, but in late-night bar confessions and stories overheard at gas stations. Forty is a milestone. But it‚Äôs also a mirror. And what I see in it is a man who has something to say‚Äîand the stubbornness to keep saying it.

So pour me a glass. Light the candle. Let‚Äôs write the next forty.

My uncle was supposed to come but didn‚Äôt show up. This has happened a couple of times over the years as he is a functional alcoholic. He always brings his ‚Äúfamous‚Äù potato salad. My grandma sent my parents and I over to check on him because he didn‚Äôt answer her call that morning (they have coffee on Sunday mornings) and then didn‚Äôt show up to Easter. The last time he didn‚Äôt show to a scheduled event he had tripped halfway down his steps and was passed out bleeding when my gma found him. 

We go over there and my dad pounds on his door but no answer. His truck isn‚Äôt outside like normal so my dad thinks he went somewhere as the last time we were there he didn‚Äôt have room in his garage to park the truck. We leave and go to this corner thing and my dad calls my gma. She said she had a bad feeling so we went back and she and her husband started to drive over too. When we get there my dad is a bit angry bc ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt have to babysit a fucking 65yo‚Äù. I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be a creeper and go peek in his windows‚Äù. 

The first window I look in is above the kitchen sink. I saw boiled eggs and potato chunks in a strainer in the sink and my heart and stomach instantly dropped. They were obviously old as there was a film on the potatoes and the eggs had yellow spots at the top. I turned to my parents and said ‚Äúsomething is seriously wrong, we have to get in there now!‚Äù. They ask why and I explain then go back to look into the other window. 

This window had a screen and was the living room one. It was completely dark but I could see a little of the floor and loveseat. I tried flashing my phone light but it didn‚Äôt help. My dad knocked a bunch, and eventually I figured out I could slide the screen up. I did and could see my uncle ‚Äúpassed out‚Äù in his recliner. It sorta looked like he was sleeping but his head had fallen to the side so I instantly thought he was dead but didn‚Äôt want to freak my parents out. I told them I could see him and said something like ‚Äúhe is going to have a sore neck when he wakes up‚Äù trying to hint at the severity of the situation.

My dad continued to pound on his door and I started banging on the window. He didn‚Äôt move at all. I told them and my mom said that my dad needs to break the door down. He didn‚Äôt and I tried opening the window but it was locked. There was a storm window right next the the door and my dad managed to open it. We started screaming his name. Still no movement. Now my parents are frantic as there is no way he is sleeping through our screams. My parents are in their late 50s and bigger so I volunteer to go through the window. 

I moved the vacuum as far as I could and started throwing shit anyway from under the window. Told my dad he was going to have to grab my feet and shove me in bc the window wasn‚Äôt open much. He did and luckily I moved the vacuum back more bc I tried to gently lower myself but fell. I have bruises all over my thighs and shoulder and my hip hurts soooo bad today. I get up and go unlock the door. I turn to go help my uncle and my dad grabs my arm and says ‚Äústay outside‚Äù. 

My dad goes in and we hear him yelling my uncles name at him. Dad said he picked his leg up and shook it and he was cold‚Ä¶. So we cry and hug and wait for my gma and her husband.  They come and we are crying so she says ‚Äúno please, god no‚Äù and my dad says he‚Äôs gone. Her husband and my dad went in to verify and my gma looked at her husband with the last bit of hope and he shook his head and hugged her. The cry she made was heartbreaking.

My gma calls uncles son. He comes over and I‚Äôve never seen his face like that. My cousin is a very stoic man who rarely shows emotion. Him, dad and husband go in and they come out carrying multiple guns. Apparently my uncle had a OWI that made it so he wasn‚Äôt supposed to have guns. They got all the guns out then cousin called the police. My dad called my oldest sister. I called my second oldest sister. I choked on my words when I said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs gone‚Äù. She said ‚Äúno he isn‚Äôt‚Äù. I confirmed he was. She said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fucking joking me right?‚Äù And said no. Got done with that and called my other sister. I was crying as soon as she answered so she was very concerned and I told her. She started crying as well. 

We stayed until my cousin left after all the ambulances, police, coroner, morticians, and fire department were done. My uncle was a very nice man. Well liked and funny. They said it was most likely a heart attack. 

Thank you for the vent. I needed it. ",1,1745852837.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1k9xtq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ascaso/comments/1k9xtq9/steel_duo_pid_back_to_back_shot_volumes/,Steel Duo PID back to back shot volumes,"I replaced my aging Breville Barista Touch with an Ascaso Steel Duo PID a week ago. I frequently pull 2-4 espressos one after the other for myself and family members. I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm getting different weight outputs with a larger variance between the first and second shots pretty consistently, even though the prep is the same every time. Shots 2-4 seem closer/more consistent. 

Here are some details: 
- Eureka Atom W65 grinder
- Morning shots pulled in Ascaso spouted portafilter using an IMS E&B lab nanotech 22g basket (into which I fit 23.4g grind with no issue)
- Afternoon shots pulled with bottomless portafilter using a VST 22g basket basket (same 23.4g dose and same grind settings) so that I can monitor and see if any grind adjustments are needed. 
- Puck prep is consistent and the same every time: WDT, followed by the spinning distributor tool to settled the top of the puck, followed by a tamp with a Normcore 58.5mm spring tamper with the 30 lb spring. 
- Finally, a Normcore 58.5mm/1.7mm thick puck screen.

Steel Duo settings:
- 200F with offset set to 5
- Preinfusion of 4 seconds with 5 second pause
- Coffee position 2 set to 29.8 seconds

I have the Steel Duo on a smart switch and have it turn on 15 minutes before the first shot so that everything is heated up. The portafilter and filter are hot to the touch when I start the puck prep. 

I‚Äôm aiming for approximately 1:2 or 1:2.5 ratio (so between 46.8g and 58.5g with my current dose). Medium roast, sometimes medium-dark, but currently using Verve Sermon roasted 11 days ago. 

With both the IMS and VST filters my first shot is coming out around 58g, and the second shot pulled minutes later is coming out around 38-40g. Same prep and grind settings. When I use the bottomless filter in the afternoon, I‚Äôm getting 58g on the first shot with more spray/spurts (maybe minor channeling but it‚Äôs not for the entire shot), and the second shot around 38-40g with a really great looking extraction.  Literally nothing changed in between except that a shot already ran through minutes earlier. 

Based on these weights, I‚Äôm tempted to grind slightly coarser, but then the first shot is likely going to be a spraying mess at 60+g out.

All of the pucks knock out in one piece, not muddy, no visible cracks or holes. Regardless of the shot weights being off by 10-15g, they taste great. I‚Äôm just confused why the weight varies by that much. 

Is this an issue with the volumetric somehow, since I‚Äôm only running it the programmed 29.8 seconds? Is there anything I should do differently to get more consistency?

This afternoon I‚Äôm going to try and run a shot through the empty portafilter first to heat the filter up and see if it makes the shots more consistent in weight. But I welcome any other suggestions. Thanks!",3,1745852816.0,Ascaso,6,1.0,False

In very, very rare cases, the person and the chat we have would be really interesting. My LO offered everything I could ask for and more - lots of attention, time, and effort, lots of jokes, would laugh with me when I laugh, give me motivation when I need it, would listen and discuss when I rant, would make me laugh a lot, share photos of places I like, share beautiful music links, discuss travel plans, so much more without one small creepy message. When I started getting attached and liking my LO a LOT, they asked me out, I asked them if it was meant to be a ""date"" or as ""friends"" and we realised that we want different things - long-term relationship (me) vs. ""no label""/ casual dating (for them), so I told them that we should reduce the frequency of texts and text only rarely, only if it's important (because I was starting to get really attached). After trying to make me agree that it's okay to continue things the way it was and failing, they unmatched and uninstalled the app we used to chat on, and we deleted contacts. From day 4 of not hearing from my LO, but seeing this ocean of very poor texters and terrible matches, I began missing my LO too much. I'd do stupid things like sending messages and deleting messages that were sent but never read (because they had uninstalled the app), trying to send an email to them, which probably failed, after uninstalling and reinstalling the app again and again, I sent one final, long message saying if they wanted to connect, this was my contact info, I deleted my account. Trust me, instantly, I felt both sad and peaceful. I started accepting that my LO would never come back and actually feeling like moving on. 

Now, the pain is far less, I am moving on, I am able to focus on so many other things and date others, but still, when I see those apps, when I match with and chat with people who may or may not be nice but their communication skills are nowhere near this charming LO, I really begin missing them hard. I ahve no idea whether my LO really meant that or what, but it felt like they really cared about me, they would ask so many detailed questions and remember tiny details about things I do, my plans, my likes and dislikes, etc. And these matches just be like, ""wassup"", ""howdy"", ""can we meet for coffee"", ""join me for drinks this staurday?"", and I really miss my LO -they are the best! I recently dated a nice, cool person I met on these apps, but they barely ever text. In eprson, they are nice, but they show very little interest in text, but my LO and I would text and laugh for hours everyday!

I'm sure there's some people here that are big fans of coffee. I've been wondering if I should try more herbal teas.

Personally, I like coffee a lot. I think I like coffee most for the euphoric feeling, more than any kind of alertness. Lately I've been buying roasted coffee beans and then I grind them right before using them in a drip coffee maker that has an insulated carafe (so it doesn't heat the coffee after it's made). If I was making coffee for more people I would probably switch to the pre-ground stuff, it is a bit of a hassle. I am cutting back a lot on my late-night black coffee, even though I enjoy it. I guess I was using it as a bit of a mood boost. I prefer the medium roasts to the really dark ones, but I'm still exploring things aside from what's available in my very basic usual grocery store.

I used to occasionally drink tea, but I would notice that sometimes green tea would give me this weird sort of cosmic-level anxiety. I noticed it with some brands more than others - it wasn't a debilitating thing, just made me feel a way I really didn't like. A few weeks ago I just put away all my green and black teas and I don't miss anything. I've never found tea to be calming and relaxing the way coffee is.

I like camomille-based herbal teas in the evening to get to sleep. The Dreamtime tea from President's Choice is nice. I sometimes make Rooibos tea during the day, but I wouldn't say I love it. I've drunk yerba mate regularly for at least a few months, out of a gourd and everything, but I didn't feel much from it. 

I've recently started occasionally buying a bottle of komboucha...I have some suspicion it might help me a bit with gut/general health, but I know it could just be my imagination.

Oh, and I do try to drink plain tap water regularly, I recently even bought a nice little day-pack I can sling over one shoulder that fits a bottle of water so I can take one along even if I am just going out to walk for a few hours.

So yeah, I thought it would be interesting to hear what others drink regularly - coffees, teas, energy drinks, weird plant concoctions, milk from strange animals, etc. If you want to you can include drinks that contain alcohol, though that's not really the kind of drinks I was thinking about.",5,1745852735.0,Schizoid,7,1.0,False

You're not alone! The allure of all-inclusive resorts, especially when tiny humans are involved, is undeniable. But the thought of navigating the vast options, ensuring it's truly family-friendly, and getting the best bang for your buck can feel a bit‚Ä¶daunting, couldn‚Äôt it? Well, buckle up, buttercups, because we‚Äôre about to embark on a deep dive into making that perfect all-inclusive Mexico family vacation a reality, and we‚Äôll spill the beans on everything you need to know and then some. Forget the frantic Googling; we‚Äôve got you covered from sandy toes to sunset cocktails. This isn't just a list of resorts; it's your roadmap to creating unforgettable memories without the stress! Ready to dive in? Let's go!

Why an All-Inclusive Mexico Family Trip is a No-Brainer (Especially When You're Juggling Little Ones!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs be honest, traveling with kids can be a bit of a circus, can‚Äôt it? The packing, the planning, the relentless requests for snacks‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a lot. And when you add in the cost of meals, activities, and all those little extras that pop up, a seemingly affordable trip can quickly balloon into a budget-busting nightmare. That's where the magic of an all-inclusive resort in Mexico for families truly shines. Imagine‚Ä¶ no more hunting for kid-friendly restaurants on the fly, no more tantrums over expensive sugary drinks by the pool, and no more unexpected charges adding up at checkout. It‚Äôs like having a superhero cape for your wallet and your sanity! An all-inclusive truly simplifies things, allowing you to focus on what really matters: making precious memories with your loved ones in a stunning setting.

### The Sweet Relief of Knowing It‚Äôs All Covered: Why the All-Inclusive Model Rocks for Families

Okay, let's break down the sheer brilliance of the all-inclusive concept, particularly when traveling with your mini-mes. Beyond the simple fact that your food and drinks are included, there's a deeper layer of convenience that‚Äôs a game-changer. Think about it: kids are notoriously unpredictable eaters. One minute they‚Äôre starving, the next they‚Äôre turning their noses up at everything. With an all-inclusive, you have the flexibility to hop between different restaurants, grab a quick bite at a snack bar, or even order room service without worrying about the bill adding up. This is a lifesaver when someone decides they *only* want chicken nuggets at precisely 3 PM.

Furthermore, the built-in activities at most family-friendly all-inclusive resorts are fantastic. Kids‚Äô clubs, splash pads, organized games, evening entertainment ‚Äì it‚Äôs all there, usually included in the price. This means less scrambling to find things to keep everyone entertained and more opportunities for parents to actually relax for a few minutes. Plus, knowing that tipping is often included takes away another potential point of stress. It‚Äôs about creating a frictionless vacation experience, where you can truly unwind and enjoy being with your family. You‚Äôre not constantly reaching for your wallet, which, let's face it, is a huge psychological relief on vacation.

Navigating the Mexican Coastline: Where to Find Your Family‚Äôs All-Inclusive Paradise
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Mexican coastline is vast and varied, offering a smorgasbord of options for families. From the buzzing energy of Cancun and the Riviera Maya to the more laid-back vibes of Puerto Vallarta and the Pacific coast, each destination has its own unique flavor and attractions. Choosing the right spot depends on your family's preferences and what you envision for your ideal getaway. Do you crave vibrant nightlife and easy access to theme parks? Cancun might be your jam. Looking for stunning natural beauty and a more relaxed pace? Sayulita or the Riviera Nayarit could be calling your name. Want a blend of everything with a touch of colonial charm? Puerto Vallarta is hard to beat. It‚Äôs about finding the rhythm of the place that resonates with your family, and thankfully, Mexico offers something for everyone.

### East Coast or West Coast? Deciphering the Best Fit for Your Crew

This is a classic travel conundrum, isn't it? The ""East Coast vs. West Coast"" of Mexico for an all-inclusive family trip. Let's weigh the pros and cons, keeping families top of mind.

- **The Caribbean Coast (Cancun, Riviera Maya, Playa del Carmen, Tulum):**
    
    
    - **Pros:**
        
        
        - **Gorgeous turquoise water:** Seriously, the colors are out of this world. It's postcard-perfect.
        - **Soft, white sand beaches:** Ideal for little feet to run and play.
        - **Abundance of activities:** Theme parks (Xcaret, Xel-H√°), cenotes for swimming, ancient ruins (Chichen Itza, Tulum), great snorkeling and diving. You'll never be bored.
        - **Easy accessibility:** Numerous direct flights from major North American cities.
        - **Wide range of all-inclusive resorts:** From mega-resorts with endless amenities to smaller, boutique options.
        - **Generally calm waters:** Many areas are protected by a reef, making them great for swimming.
    - **Cons:**
        
        
        - **Can be crowded:** Especially during peak season.
        - **More developed/touristy:** If you're looking for a truly authentic local experience, you might need to venture further afield.
        - **Potential for seaweed (sargassum):** This can be an issue at certain times of the year, although resorts work hard to clear it.
- **The Pacific Coast (Puerto Vallarta, Riviera Nayarit, Los Cabos):**
    
    
    - **Pros:**
        
        
        - **Stunning mountain and ocean views:** The dramatic coastline is breathtaking.
        - **Charming towns and culture:** Puerto Vallarta, for instance, has a lovely downtown with cobblestone streets and art galleries.
        - **Excellent food scene:** While all-inclusive, you can also easily explore local restaurants.
        - **Whale watching opportunities:** Especially during the winter months off the coast of Puerto Vallarta/Riviera Nayarit.
        - **More laid-back vibe in certain areas:** Riviera Nayarit offers some quieter, more bohemian towns like Sayulita.
        - **Less crowded than the Caribbean coast in many areas.**
    - **Cons:**
        
        
        - **Water can be rougher:** The Pacific can have stronger waves, so pay attention to beach conditions, especially with smaller children.
        - **Beaches are typically darker sand.**
        - **Fewer massive theme parks compared to the Caribbean side.**

Ultimately, the ""best"" coast is a matter of personal preference. If your family dreams of swimming in clear turquoise waters and exploring ancient ruins, the Caribbean is probably calling your name. If you prefer dramatic landscapes, cultural experiences, and are okay with potentially wavier ocean conditions, the Pacific might be a better fit. Many families happily return to both coasts, finding different joys in each!

Decoding the All-Inclusive Magic: What‚Äôs Actually Included? (And What Might Not Be!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so you‚Äôve zeroed in on the general idea of an all-inclusive family trip to Mexico. You picture lounging by the pool, sipping a frosty drink, and not having to worry about a single extra cost. But let‚Äôs get real for a second. While the term ‚Äúall-inclusive‚Äù conjures up images of boundless food, drink, and fun, it‚Äôs crucial to understand the nuances. Not all all-inclusives are created equal! There can be a difference between a truly comprehensive package and one that tacks on extra charges for certain amenities or activities. Doing your homework here can save you from unpleasant surprises down the line. It's kind of like ordering that fancy coffee ‚Äì you think you know what you're getting, and then *bam!* there's an extra charge for almond milk. Avoid that feeling on vacation by getting the scoop beforehand.

### Beyond the Buffet: Understanding the Scope of Your All-Inclusive Package

The core of an all-inclusive package typically includes all your meals (usually at multiple restaurants, both buffet and √† la carte), unlimited drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), and access to the resort's facilities like pools, beaches, and basic non-motorized water sports. This is the baseline. However, the ""all"" in all-inclusive can stretch or shrink depending on the resort and the specific package you book.

Here are some things to look out for and clarify before you book:

- **Restaurants:** How many are there? Are reservations required for √† la carte options? Are there limits on how many times you can eat at the specialty restaurants? Are there any restaurants that require an extra charge? (Sometimes the very high-end ones do).
- **Drinks:** Are premium liquors included, or just local brands? Is bottled water readily available (essential for staying hydrated in the heat!)? Is there a swim-up bar? (A little luxury for the adults!)
- **Activities:** What water sports are included? Is it just kayaks and paddleboards, or also things like hobie cats? Are there organized classes or activities like yoga, cooking demos, or dance lessons? Is the kids' club free and what are its hours and age range? Is evening entertainment (shows, live music) included?
- **Amenities:** Is Wi-Fi included and available throughout the resort? Is there a gym? Are there sports courts (tennis, basketball)? Is the use of beach chairs and towels included?
- **Excursions and Tours:** These are almost always an extra cost, but some resorts have tour desks that can help you book them.
- **Spa Services:** Usually an additional charge.
- **Premium Amenities:** Some resorts offer ""club level"" or ""preferred status"" packages that include extras like dedicated concierge service, access to exclusive lounges or pool areas, and upgraded room amenities. These come at a higher price point.

Don‚Äôt be shy about asking questions! A good resort will be transparent about what‚Äôs included in their all-inclusive offering. It‚Äôs better to clarify upfront than to be surprised by extra charges later. Think of it as putting on your investigative hat ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the little bit of effort to ensure a smooth and stress-free vacation.

So, you‚Äôve decided on an all-inclusive family adventure in Mexico. Fantastic! Now comes the fun (and sometimes overwhelming) part: actually picking the resort. It‚Äôs like being a kid in a candy store, but instead of sugary treats, you‚Äôre looking at infinity pools, swim-up bars, and kids' clubs. With so many options, how do you narrow it down and find the perfect fit for *your* family? It's not just about a pretty picture in a brochure; you need to consider the nitty-gritty that makes a family vacation work.

### Kid-Centric Amenities That Make All the Difference: Beyond the Basic Pool

When traveling with kids, the resort's amenities aren't just a bonus; they're a necessity. And I'm talking beyond the standard swimming pool. While a pool is great, a *family-friendly* resort goes the extra mile to keep the little ones entertained and occupied. This, in turn, allows the adults to have some much-needed downtime.

Here are some kid-centric amenities that should be on your radar:

1. **Fantastic Kids‚Äô Club:** This is often the MVP of a family resort. A good kids' club should have age-appropriate activities, engaged staff, safety protocols, and dedicated spaces for crafts, games, and possibly even nap time for the youngest guests. Look for clubs with long operating hours and flexibility.
2. **Awesome Water Features:** Beyond the main pool, look for resorts with a dedicated splash pad or water park area. Slides, dumping buckets, and shallow pools are perfect for little ones (and let's be honest, sometimes big ones too!).
3. **Multiple Pool Options:** Having adult-only pools and quieter zones is important for parents who want a break, while separate family pools keep the energy contained.
4. **Playgrounds:** A simple playground can provide hours of entertainment and a change of pace from the pool.
5. **Shallow Beach Areas:** If the resort is on the beach, look for sections where the water is calm and shallow, ideal for wading and playing in the sand.
6. **Family-Friendly Room Configurations:** Options like connecting rooms, suites with separate living areas, or rooms with bunk beds can make a big difference in comfort and space.
7. **Kid-Friendly Dining Options:** Does the resort have dedicated kids' menus? Are there casual dining spots where you can grab quick, easy meals? Is high-chair availability good? Is there access to snacks throughout the day?
8. **Babysitting Services:** While not always included, knowing that reliable babysitting is available (even for an extra fee) can be a lifesaver for a dinner date or a few hours of adult pool time.
9. **Age-Appropriate Activities:** Look for resorts that cater to different age groups. Teen clubs with activities for older kids (game rooms, social events) can be just as crucial as the facilities for younger children.
10. **Easy Navigation:** A sprawling resort with young kids can be a challenge. Consider the layout and whether there's a tram or golf cart service if it‚Äôs very large.

Choosing a resort with a strong focus on keeping the kids happy is key to a successful *all inclusive Mexico family* vacation. Happy kids usually mean happy parents!

Insider Tips and Tricks for Your All-Inclusive Mexican Family Getaway
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You‚Äôve picked your destination, you‚Äôve got a shortlist of resorts, and you‚Äôre getting excited! But before you hit ""book,"" let‚Äôs talk strategy. Planning an all-inclusive family trip isn‚Äôt just about choosing where to go; it‚Äôs about planning *how* you‚Äôll make the most of it. There are little things you can do, little nuggets of wisdom, that can elevate your trip from great to absolutely unforgettable. Think of these as the secret sauce to a stress-free and incredibly fun family vacation down in the land of tacos and sunshine.

### Making the Most of Your Stay: Practical Advice for a Smooth Trip

Alright, let‚Äôs get down to brass tacks. You‚Äôre on the ground in Mexico at your beautiful all-inclusive resort. How do you make the most of it with your family in tow? It‚Äôs all about smart planning and a little bit of local know-how.

Here are some practical tips to keep in mind:

- **Pack Smart, Not Just More:** Yes, you need swimsuits and sunblock. But think about what else will make your life easier. A small first-aid kit, insulated water bottles to keep drinks cool, sand tools for the beach, and maybe a few familiar toys or books from home can go a long way. Don‚Äôt forget a lightweight stroller or carrier if you have little ones.
- **Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate!** The Mexican sun is no joke. Even if drinks are unlimited, make a conscious effort for everyone to drink plenty of water. Many resorts have water filling stations.
- **Embrace the Kids‚Äô Club (If That's Your Vibe):** If your kids are comfortable, the kids' club can be a fantastic resource. It gives them a chance to socialize and have fun in a supervised environment, and it gives you a much-needed break. Start with short stints if your kids are hesitant.
- **Make Restaurant Reservations Early (If Possible):** √Ä la carte restaurants are popular, and booking ahead can save you waiting time or disappointment. Check the resort's policy on reservations when you arrive.
- **Consider Travel Insurance:** It's always a good idea to have travel insurance, especially when traveling internationally with family. It covers unexpected medical issues or trip disruptions.
- **Factor in Down Time:** While it's tempting to cram in every activity, remember that kids (and adults!) need downtime. Don't overschedule yourselves. Relax by the pool, read a book, or just chill in your room.
- **Explore Beyond the Resort (Safely):** While the all-inclusive bubble is comfortable, consider taking a guided tour or visiting a nearby town to experience a bit of local culture. Research reputable tour operators.
- **Learn a Few Basic Spanish Phrases:** Saying ""Hola,"" ""Gracias,"" and ""¬øC√≥mo est√°?"" can go a long way with the resort staff and locals. It shows respect and is just plain nice!
- **Be Mindful of Tipping:** While tipping is often included in all-inclusive, it's still customary and appreciated to tip staff who go above and beyond, like porters, housekeepers, and your favorite bartender. Bring small bills (USD or pesos) for this.
- **Sunscreen is Your Best Friend (and Reapply Often!):** We all know this, but it bears repeating. Get sunblock with a high SPF and make reapplying a regular habit, especially after swimming. Consider rash guards for added protection for the kids.

Following these tips can help ensure your all-inclusive family trip to Mexico is as smooth and enjoyable as possible. It‚Äôs about being prepared and then letting go and having fun!

Sensory Overload (in the Best Possible Way!): Experiencing the Flavors and Sounds of Mexico
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beyond the resort walls, Mexico is a vibrant tapestry of sights, sounds, and smells. Even within the all-inclusive bubble, many resorts strive to infuse a sense of place, offering authentic Mexican cuisine, live music, and perhaps even cultural performances. Embracing these elements, even in a contained environment, can enrich your family's experience and give everyone a taste (literally!) of the local culture. It‚Äôs about letting your senses guide you and being open to new experiences, from the smoky aroma of grilled meats to the rhythmic beats of mariachi music.

### Taste Bud Adventures: Exploring the Culinary Delights (Even at the Buffet!)

One of the absolute highlights of any trip to Mexico, and particularly an all-inclusive, is the food! While some might worry about the quality at a buffet, many all-inclusive resorts in Mexico take their culinary offerings seriously, featuring a wide variety of options that go well beyond the usual suspects. This is your chance to introduce your kids to new flavors without the pressure of a formal restaurant setting.

Here's how to make the most of the food scene at your *all inclusive Mexico family* resort:

- **Don‚Äôt Be Afraid to Try New Things:** Encourage your kids (and yourselves!) to sample a little bit of everything. Tacos al pastor, fresh ceviche, cochinita pibil, chiles rellenos ‚Äì the possibilities are endless! Even if a dish looks unfamiliar, start with a small portion.
- **Utilize the Specialty Restaurants:** While buffets are convenient, the √† la carte restaurants often offer a more refined dining experience and an opportunity to try specific regional dishes. Make reservations in advance for these.
- **Seek Out Authentic Corners:** Some buffets have dedicated stations for regional Mexican specialties. Look for these to get a true taste of the local cuisine.
- **Fresh is Best:** Load up on fresh fruits and vegetables, which are usually plentiful at resorts in Mexico. Mangoes, papayas, pineapples ‚Äì they're incredible!
- **Hydrate with Aguas Frescas:** These refreshing fruit-infused waters are a staple in Mexico and a great alternative to sugary sodas. Try flavors like jamaica (hibiscus), horchata (rice milk with cinnamon), and sand√≠a (watermelon).
- **Don‚Äôt Forget the Snacks!** All-inclusives are perfect for satisfying those mid-afternoon munchies. Nachos by the pool, fresh fruit on the beach, ice cream whenever the craving strikes ‚Äì it‚Äôs all part of the fun!
- **Talk to the Chefs:** If you have dietary restrictions or allergies, don't hesitate to speak to the resort's chefs or restaurant staff. They are often happy to accommodate yourneeds.
- **Experience a Theme Night:** Many resorts have themed dinner nights, like a Mexican Fiesta or a seafood barbecue. These can be a fun way to experience different types of cuisine and enjoy some entertainment.

Food is such an integral part of the Mexican experience. Even within the all-inclusive framework, you can embark on a delicious culinary adventure that will tantalize your taste buds and create lasting memories. Bon app√©tit, or as they say in Mexico, buen provecho!

Making Memories That Last a Lifetime: The Intangible Value of an All-Inclusive Family Trip
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of the day, the true value of an all-inclusive family trip to Mexico isn‚Äôt just about the included food and drinks or the convenient amenities. It‚Äôs about the memories you create together. It‚Äôs the sound of your kids‚Äô laughter echoing through the resort, the shared wonder of seeing colorful fish while snorkeling, the simple joy of building sandcastles on the beach, and the quiet moments of connection as you watch the sunset together. These are the things that truly matter, and an all-inclusive resort, by taking care of the logistical headaches, allows you to be present and fully immersed in these precious family moments. It‚Äôs an investment in shared experiences and the strengthening of family bonds, and that, my friends, is priceless.

### Beyond the Perfect Photo: Cherishing the Small Moments

While we all love a good vacation photo to post on Instagram, the real magic of an *all inclusive Mexico family* trip lies in the small, often un-photographed moments. It‚Äôs the look on your child‚Äôs face when they try a new fruit for the first time, the giggle shared over a silly splash in the pool, the feeling of warm sand between your toes, and the shared stories told over dinner. These are the moments that weave the fabric of family memories.

Here's how to savor those small moments:

- **Put Down the Phone:** While it‚Äôs tempting to document everything, make a conscious effort to put your phone away and just *be* with your family. Watch them play, engage in conversations, and genuinely connect.
- **Embrace Spontaneity:** While planning is important, leave room for spontaneous adventures. Maybe it‚Äôs an impromptu dance party by the pool or a late-night walk on the beach to look at the stars.
- **Encourage Exploration:** Let your kids lead the way sometimes. Let them choose which pool to swim in or which flavor of ice cream to try. Their excitement is infectious.
- **Create Family Rituals:** Maybe it‚Äôs a nightly walk on the beach to collect shells, a morning coffee on the balcony together, or a specific game you play by the pool. These small rituals can become cherished memories.
- **Reflect on the Day:** At dinner or before bed, ask everyone about their favorite part of the day. This encourages reflection and helps solidify the memories.
- **Don‚Äôt Sweat the Small Stuff:** Things won't always go perfectly. There might be a spilled drink, a minor squabble, or a hiccup with a reservation. Take a deep breath, remember you‚Äôre on vacation, and let it go.
- **Connect with Each Other:** Use the relaxed atmosphere to have meaningful conversations. Ask your kids what they‚Äôre thinking and feeling. Share stories from your own childhood.
- **Practice Gratitude:** Take a moment each day to appreciate where you are and who you're with. The simple act of acknowledging the beauty around you can make even the smallest moments feel special.

An all-inclusive vacation provides the perfect backdrop for these types of moments. With the practicalities taken care of, you‚Äôre free to focus on the joy of simply being together. It's not just a vacation; it's an opportunity to strengthen your family bonds and create a treasure trove of cherished memories.

So I (29F) went on a date recently with a guy (31M) a friend set me up with. At first, things were going great,  we had a lot in common, good conversation, lots of laughs. We grabbed coffee and pastries, the bill came out to about less than $100. When the bill arrived, I was ready to split it, no problem. But instead of splitting, he handed me the bill and said, ""Is it alright if you pay for this?"" No explanation, no offer to cover next time, just that. I was a little surprised, but okay, it wasn‚Äôt that much, so I paid.

As soon as I handed the money over and got my change, he smiled so big and said, ""Congratulations, you passed the test! You're not a gold digger."" Apparently, his ex used to expect him to pay for everything, dates, trips, etc. and he got fed up with it. So now he ""tests"" women to see if they're after his money or not. Honestly, I was so annoyed. I told him that I'm not his ex and he has no right to treat me like I'm guilty until proven innocent. I also said he‚Äôs not some prize that I need to pass tests for. Then I got up and left.

Afterward, I texted our mutual friend to let him know what happened. He apologized and said he'd talk to the guy. I told him I‚Äôm blocking him and I don‚Äôt want anything to do with him anymore.

The thing is, it's not even about the money. I have a good career, I own property, I'm very financially independent. I absolutely don‚Äôt want to be anyone‚Äôs ATM either. But I would never pull a stunt like that to ""test"" someone‚Äôs character. The way he said ""Congratulations"" like I‚Äôd won something seriously rubbed me the wrong way. It just felt so gross and weird. But now I‚Äôm wondering... was I too harsh? Should I have just let it go and chalked it up to him being burned before? AITAH?",4234,1745852544.0,AITAH,901,0.96,False

It‚Äôs like trying to herd cats, right? üê±

Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: **you can hack your brain**. Not with some obscure potion or hours of meditation, but with a simple technique called **Box Breathing**, and it's backed by science! üß†‚ú®

Imagine this: You're on the verge of panic, deadlines looming, and cortisol ‚Äì your stress hormone ‚Äì is throwing a wild partyüéâ. What if I told you that in just **2 minutes, you could hit the reset button** on all that chaos?

**Here's how Box Breathing works:**  
1. **Inhale deeply for 4 seconds** ‚Äì feel the cool air filling your lungs.  
2. **Hold your breath for 4 seconds** ‚Äì let the calm sink in. *Embrace the stillness.*  
3. **Exhale slowly for 4 seconds** ‚Äì release all the tension.  
4. **Hold again for 4 seconds** ‚Äì yep, you can do this.  

Repeat this cycle a few times until you feel like a zen master on a mountaintop. üóª

Sound too good to be true? Listen, I was skeptical too. But then, on one particularly chaotic day where my brain resembled scrambled eggs üç≥, I gave it a shot. And wow, within a minute, it was like my mental dust settled. I went from scramble to focus faster than my cat pounces on an empty box. üì¶

Here's what‚Äôs happening: **You‚Äôre regulating your nervous system**, coaxing your cortisol levels down, and giving your brain that ""Ahhhh"" it desperately wants. It‚Äôs the adult version of a time-out, but much cooler and with fewer tantrums.

**Why does this matter for you?**  
- **Instant calm:** Two minutes ‚Äì the length of a microwave popcorn session.
- **Improved focus:** Like having coffee without the jitters.
- **Portable:** Do it anywhere ‚Äì in traffic, before a meeting, during your third existential crisis today.

Now imagine introducing this technique during a stressful moment at work or when your brain refuses to cooperate during study sessions. Wouldn't it be nice to have a superpower that lets you regain control?

So, **next time you're spiraling**, give Box Breathing a whirl. It‚Äôs your quick-fix CNS* restorer ‚Äì no yoga mat needed! And hey, if it works wonders for you, maybe share your experience with a friend. Or, keep it as your little secret weapon against stress.

What do you think? Does Box Breathing sound like your new mini-sanctuary? I‚Äôd love to see how it fits into your day. üåü",1,1745852404.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

The ketogenic diet has revolutionized how people approach weight loss and nutrition, but navigating the world of low-carb beverages can feel like walking through a dietary minefield. Diet sodas have long been a controversial topic among keto enthusiasts, with passionate debates about whether these zero-calorie drinks are truly keto-friendly or secret saboteurs of your metabolic goals. As more people embrace the ketogenic lifestyle, understanding the real impact of diet sodas becomes crucial for maintaining ketosis and overall health.

Is Zero Calories Always Zero Threat?

The keto diet demands meticulous attention to every ingredient that crosses your plate - or in this case, enters your glass. Diet sodas promise a tantalizing zero-carb option that seems perfect for those committed to maintaining ketosis. But are these fizzy beverages truly the miracle solution they appear to be, or do they hide potential metabolic pitfalls that could derail your dietary efforts?

Understanding Diet Sodas and Ketosis

**What Makes a Beverage Keto-Friendly?**

When evaluating diet sodas through a keto lens, several critical factors come into play:

1. Carbohydrate Content
2. Artificial Sweetener Impact
3. Metabolic Response
4. Overall Health Considerations

Ingredient Analysis: The Hidden Truth

Artificial sweeteners populate diet sodas, creating a complex nutritional landscape for keto dieters. While most contain zero net carbs, their metabolic interactions are far more nuanced than simple carbohydrate counting. Click here to learn more for a healthier you: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com

The Metabolic Maze of Artificial Sweeteners

Several key artificial sweeteners commonly found in diet sodas include:

- Aspartame
- Sucralose
- Stevia
- Ace-K (Acesulfame Potassium)

Each sweetener interacts differently with the body's metabolic processes, potentially triggering insulin responses that could compromise ketosis.

Potential Risks of Excessive Diet Soda Consumption

**Insulin and Metabolic Responses**

Research suggests that artificial sweeteners might:

1. Trigger subtle insulin responses
2. Potentially disrupt gut microbiome
3. Create unexpected metabolic challenges
4. Influence hunger and cravings

Scientific Perspective on Diet Sodas

Numerous studies have explored the complex relationship between artificial sweeteners and metabolic health. While results remain mixed, emerging research indicates potential concerns beyond simple carbohydrate content. Click here to learn more for a healthier you: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com

Alternatives for Keto-Friendly Hydration

**Exploring Better Beverage Options**

Consider these keto-approved alternatives:

- Water with fresh lemon
- Unsweetened tea
- Black coffee
- Sparkling water with natural flavors
- Bone broth

Practical Recommendations for Diet Soda Consumption

Moderation remains key when incorporating diet sodas into a ketogenic lifestyle. Experts recommend:

- Limiting intake to 1-2 servings daily
- Prioritizing water as primary hydration
- Monitoring individual metabolic responses
- Choosing brands with minimal additional ingredients

Psychological and Craving Considerations

Diet sodas can serve as a psychological bridge for those transitioning to a ketogenic diet, providing a familiar flavor profile while eliminating sugar. However, mindful consumption is crucial to preventing potential metabolic disruptions.

**The Balanced Approach**

While diet sodas aren't inherently ""bad,"" they shouldn't become a dietary crutch. Intelligent integration, combined with comprehensive nutritional awareness, allows for occasional enjoyment without compromising your ketogenic goals.

Conclusion

Navigating the diet soda debate requires nuanced understanding and personal experimentation. While these beverages can potentially fit within a ketogenic framework, they should not be considered a nutritional free pass. Prioritize whole-food hydration sources, listen to your body's unique responses, and approach diet sodas with informed moderation.

### About Me

27, Male, 60-65 MPW

### Training
My pervious PR of 2:57 was achieved at the Columbus Marathon back in 2023. My training only peaked at 55 miles per week, and was based loosely around the Pfitz 18/55 plan, minus the mid-week long runs.

For some background, I've been running casually since highschool and Glass City was my 5th serious attempt at a marathon. My progression has been: 3:00, 3:00, 2:57, 2:59, 2:51. 4 marathons in a row within 3 minutes of each other certainly isn't what I would call a progression, however, it was a symptom of doing the same thing and expecting different results.

If you've read race reports on here before, you're probably already thinking ""this guy increased his mileage"". And you would be right.

For this block, I dovetailed my training with a half marathon training block from the fall where I ran a 1:21. My training included 55+ miles for 12 weeks with plenty of speed work sprinkled throughout. I took it easy for the last two weeks of December before cranking it back up to 60 miles a week, with 3 65 mile peak weeks in March. I also did 4 20 milers with speed work incorporated. Honestly, I've never felt fast than I do right now (minus the post-race fatigue, of course.) my HR at 7:15 pace has been around 136ish, which told me that I was ready to go faster than my previous 4 races.

For this race, I decided to use the ""manual lap"" mode on my watch and switch the ""total distance"" tracker to ""lap distance"". I did this so I would be racing the mile I'm in, and so I would be more cognizant of how well I was racing the tangents.

I also made a Spotify playlist with song suggestions from friends and family that had a duration of 2:55. I figured I would know about how much more I had left based on the song.

Originally, I signed up for Glass City. My wife and I booked a trip to Hawaii that was going to be leaving on Monday, so running on Sunday would work out great.

### The Issue

Due to scheduling conflicts and a flight change, we were now looking at departing from Detroit at about 1pm on Sunday. My wife and I were both concerned with how close we would be cutting it, so I decided to sign up for Carmel to prevent having to sprint to the Airport.

### Carmel
lol. Lmao, even. Drove 3 hours from Columbus, Got a hotel room, family came down to watch, and at 5:50 on race morning I get an email that says ""CANCELLED: Carmel Marathon"". 

Despite my frustration, I understood why they did it. The Carmel race director and team did a fantastic job following up about the cancellation and their rationale. They sent pictures of the finish line structure that was damaged beyond repair from the storm, and all of the gates scattered around the road. 

I drove home full of energy, and ripped out a 13 mile run at 6:50/mile. During that run, I made the decision to run Glass City, and devise a plan to get to the airport on time.

The schedule was as follows:

4:30am - Wake up
5:30am - Get to start line
6:30am - Start race
9:25am - finish racing and get snacks

Leave for airport by 10:30 after a shower and a meal.

Get to airport by 11:30

Board airplane at 12:20

### Race
Race day was perfect. I could not have asked for better weather, and the city of Toledo did a great job organizing the event. Met a few people who were also going to run Carmel as well.

Miles 1-4: 
Simple loop around the block. Several churches had clergy members flinging holy water at us, which was funny. I was hitting my splits, and felt relaxed heading up to university hills.

Mile 5-12:
First chunk of the race was through Ottawa hills, which has some big houses, and plenty of crowd support. There was a water/gatorade stop around every corner here.

Mile 13-20:
Wildwood metropark and the first stint down the bike trail were simple with minimal turns. Was it scenic? Not really, but was it fast? You bet. It felt like I was on a Sunday long run in the best way. 

Mile 20-Finish:
6 miles of straight bike trail. If I had bonked, this would have been hell on earth. But I trained well and had a maurten 100 every 4 miles, so it almost felt like I was on a treadmill.

### Post-race
Finished in 2:51, power walked straight to the car to see my family, got home, 5 minute shower, inhaled a massive sub and coffee, and got the airport with a few minutes to spare.

11 hours of flying after a race isn't as bad as I thought it would be. Sure, I was sore. But I had an aisle seat, and had plenty of of food.

All-in-all, I recommend the Glass City Marathon. Happy with this race and training block.

I was thinking about this the other day... dating apps are so normal now, yet some people still act weird about admitting they use them.

1k9xhgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BBQGrill/comments/1k9xhgj/investigate_if_the_vankey_kamado_cast_iron_cap/,Investigate if the Vankey Kamado Cast Iron Cap lives up to its review!,"Having frequently used barbecue grills over the years, I jumped at the chance to try out the Vankey B08F54PJB2 Umbrella Cast Iron Cap for Kamado Joe Classic and Big Joe Series. This grill cap is designed as a replacement for the Kamado Joe dual-function metal chimney top, and with my Kamado Joe setup, I was curious to see how it would perform. As someone who grills practically every weekend, I gave it a thorough run to evaluate its features, upsides, and downfalls. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
There is something immediately satisfying about the robust build of this umbrella-shaped cast iron cap. The sturdy cast aluminum material gives it a lightweight feel, yet it doesn‚Äôt compromise on durability. My Kamado Joe grill had been overdue for an upgrade, and this cap, with its non-rusting properties, was exactly what I needed. The bright red color gives it a visually striking appearance, matching the vivid personality of my grill. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the split-design structure works like magic when you‚Äôre trying to clean or adjust airflow‚Äîflexibility that genuinely enhances the user experience.

[Check Vankey B08F54PJB2 price on Amazon.](https://thebbqgrill.com/p/b08f54pjb2/)

**Weatherproof Capabilities**  
One major selling point for me was its weather-resistant features. I live in an area where unexpected rains are frequent, and nothing ruins a barbecue like water sneaking into the grill. The umbrella design kept my charcoal dry despite some heavy drizzle one evening. Between rain and snow (yes, I experiment with winter BBQ), it creates an effective shield that prevents water from entering the oven. I no longer have to panic and reach for a tarp to cover my grill mid-cook.

**Temperature Control**  
Precise cooking often makes or breaks a grilling experience, and this cast iron cap didn‚Äôt disappoint. With its five-speed smoke exhaust adjustment, I was able to tinker with the airflow just enough to keep a steady temperature, whether for low and slow ribs or a quick char on steaks. The adjustable vents on the surface allowed for nuanced control, and I could feel the difference in the way the grill retained heat compared to the standard daisy wheel on my older setup. It‚Äôs a small tweak, but it has a big impact on cooking outcomes. 

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
Though the product does require some assembly, it wasn‚Äôt a challenge‚Äîit took me about 10 minutes while sipping my coffee. The manufacturer provided clear instructions, which made it hassle-free to install on my Kamado Joe. The split-type design was especially handy; when the airflow wasn‚Äôt strong enough, popping off the cover to circulate more air was a breeze. Having this level of control gave me confidence when experimenting with different recipes, from smoked brisket to charred pineapple skewers. 

**Upsides**  
‚Ä¢ Durable and lightweight cast aluminum material ensures longevity.  
‚Ä¢ Weather-resistant design keeps rain out and grilling consistent during any season.  
‚Ä¢ Five-speed smoke vent adjustment enhances precision in cooking temperatures.  
‚Ä¢ Umbrella-style cap offers better functionality than traditional daisy wheels.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
As much as I appreciated its strengths, there were a couple of things that could be refined.  
‚Ä¢ Despite being lightweight, the cap can feel slightly loose during windy conditions. I had to double-check that I placed it securely to avoid any wobble.  
‚Ä¢ Its bold red color, although attractive, might not suit those looking for neutral tones to blend into their grill setups.  

**Competing Products**  
In the world of Kamado-style grills, there are several options when upgrading grill caps. For instance, the OEM daisy wheels provided with Kamado Joe grills work decently for basic temperature control. However, they often fall short in weatherproofing and rust resistance. The Smokeware vent cap, which is another alternative, comes with stainless steel construction that rivals the durability of this umbrella cast iron cap. That said, I found the Smokeware cap lacking in the level of temperature adjustment flexibility the Vankey product provides. Additionally, this cast iron cap‚Äôs split design made cleaning considerably easier than other choices on the market. While it‚Äôs not the runaway winner against every competitor, its adaptability and premium build make it stand out in key areas.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Evaluating its financial value, I feel the product justifies its price tag with its host of smart features, especially for grill enthusiasts who care deeply about precise temperature control and durability. The robust cast aluminum material alone adds significant value as it completely eliminates the worry of rust damage. Considering its performance compared to others at a similar price point, it delivers more bang for the buck in terms of convenience and longevity.

1k9xhf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k9xhf0/does_the_aglucky_nugget_ice_maker_deliver_perfect/,Does the AGLUCKY Nugget Ice Maker Deliver Perfect Pebble Ice? Review Inside!,"The **AGLUCKY AL-FBM-15NH-GREY** ice maker became a game-changer in my kitchen routine over the past few weeks. Testing new appliances can always go one of two ways: you fall in love with added convenience, or you end up regretting the purchase. Luckily, this compact ice machine landed firmly in the former group for me‚Äîalthough not entirely without its quirks. This review is an honest breakdown of my daily experience with it, including the strengths and weaknesses I discovered along the way.

**Sleek and Portable Design Perfect for Any Space**  
At first glance, I couldn‚Äôt help but admire how compact this little marvel actually is. The dimensions, 11.3 x 8.66 x 12.68 inches, allowed me to seamlessly integrate it into my already cluttered countertop setup without sacrificing any major space. Weighing just over 20 pounds and featuring a sturdy carrying handle, repositioning it was truly effortless. Moving it between the kitchen and patio for drinks during backyard gatherings became a breeze. That portability felt like a small luxury.  

[Check AGLUCKY AL-FBM-15NH-GREY price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0cybxcgmw/)

**Rapid and Reliable Ice Production**  
This machine churns out chewable nugget ice cubes at impressive speed‚Äîjust seven minutes for the first batch, which is ridiculously convenient when hosting guests or if you're like me and forget to pre-plan an ice situation. With a daily production capacity of up to 35 pounds, I genuinely never ran out during any event or while topping off my iced coffees throughout the day. The removable basket held more ice than I originally expected, accommodating about 1.5 pounds at once.  

**Exceptional Ice Quality for Chewable Fans**  
Chewable ice was never something I gave much thought to before, but this machine turned me into a convert. The cubes were crunchy yet soft enough on the teeth‚Äîideal for munching if you‚Äôre someone who enjoys iced drinks as much for the snackable ice as the beverage. Unlike the hard conventional ice from refrigerators, these melted slower, preserving beverages longer while also being very satisfying to chew on post-drink. Whiskey enthusiasts and summer cocktail aficionados would particularly appreciate the texture and longevity of this ice.  

**Convenient Automated Features and Smart Alerts**  
User-friendly features made operating this ice maker easy even when I wasn‚Äôt paying full attention. It stops producing ice when the basket reaches full capacity, and clever indicator lights remind you when it‚Äôs time to add more water. My favorite function, though, was the advanced self-cleaning mode. A simple five-second press of the power button activates it; you fill the tank with water and let the machine clean itself. Regular maintenance like this ensured consistent performance and a longer life span for the appliance.

**Small Downsides That Might Annoy Some People**  
Of course, no product is without its flaws.  

- Fan noise during operation might be a dealbreaker for noise-sensitive households. While not overly loud, it‚Äôs noticeable in quiet settings.
- Due to the compact design, the water tank capacity is limited, which means more frequent refills compared to larger models.
- The price point felt higher than some comparable machines, though the features somewhat justify it.

**Rival Brands Worth Considering**  
Ice makers are pretty saturated in the market, but the pebble ice niche is less crowded. Compared to traditional ice makers like the GE Profile Opal, the AGLUCKY AL-FBM-15NH-GREY scores major points for affordability and size. The Opal is flashier and fancier with a higher price tag, while this one is straightforward and gets the job done without extra frills. The AGLUCKY beats out budget-friendly options like Euhomy or Igloo in terms of ice quality and design sophistication, though its noise levels slightly edge out higher-end competition. Ultimately, if you‚Äôre after unbeatable portability and chewable ice, this one holds its ground surprisingly well.  

**Quality for Price Balance**  
Considering the range of features‚Äîautomated settings, a portable form factor, and chewable ice capabilities‚Äîthe value for money feels fair but might not be a slam-dunk depending on how much you prioritize premium performance. If you're as obsessive about countertop real estate as I am, this perfectly compact design feels worth every penny, though those seeking whisper-quiet operation may not reach the same conclusion.

The tree stood where it always did, surrounded by brown grass and dirt. It stood straight as an arrow, wide as a school bus. If you looked for the top of it, it would seem as if it never stopped‚Äîperhaps it didn‚Äôt.

There sat the boy. Scuffed-up sneakers and oversized, stain-filled rags covered his body. His legs were pretzeled together as he leaned against the tree, digging his hands into the dirt. The coldness of the earth made him feel comfy. He felt the wiggling of worms between his fingers‚Äîslimy little noodles thrashing around in his hands. It made him laugh. And hungry.

He toyed with the Velcro straps on his shoes, feeling the warm air gently tussle his hair and shirt. The breeze brought the smell of rotten eggs, dog poop, and the stinging sensation of a skunk. Typical.

He opened up his pack and pulled out some broken crayons and an old notebook. Flipping to an empty page, he began to draw. As he created, his tummy growled: a picnic table full of grapes and sandwiches, potato chips, and chocolate milk to wash it all down. For dessert, he drew a cherry pie with his bright red crayon.

As he finished coloring in the pie, his mouth started to water and his stomach twisted and stretched inside him. He laid back against the tree and closed his eyes. Tears began to form, and his arm wiped them away just as quickly as they sprouted. He took a deep breath and‚Ä¶ something strange happened. A smell entered his nose‚Äîa good one.

He sat up and looked around. Nothing. Yet the scent remained: fresh-baked cherry pie. The smell grew stronger, and his stomach grew angrier. He stood up and looked around. Who would have a picnic here? He must be going crazy‚Äîhis teacher always did say his daydreaming was out of control.

He looked back at his drawing and shook his head. They‚Äôll be looking for me soon, he thought. Maybe I want them to find me this time. He was hungry, after all.

He stood, wiping the dirt from his shorts with the dirt on his hands. As he started walking back, he looped around the tree and, for the first time, realized how wide it truly was. It felt like forever to walk around it. When he reached the other side, he saw a hole at the bottom of the tree. It was just about his size sitting down, arched like a round door. The bark on the inside was bright red‚Äîalmost cherry-colored.

He peeked his head inside and looked around. Everything was red, and the bark seemed soft‚Äîsquishy, almost. He poked it with a dirty finger. Solid. What did he expect? A tree made of cherry filling? That‚Äôs what Ms. Harper had warned him about.

Still, the tree made him smile. He sat on his butt, back to the tree, and scooted himself backward into the hollow, pretending it was a spaceship. He closed his eyes and thrashed around in the hollow, fighting aliens, using thrusters and boosts to escape laser beams. He laughed and shouted, plummeting through space.

His eyes opened instantly when the scent hit him again‚Äîfainter, but still strong enough to make him question reality. He decided to crawl out of the tree and leave. His belly couldn‚Äôt handle this torture anymore.

As he stood, he almost screamed. His heart raced when he looked down and saw bright green grass engulfing his sneakers. All around him was green and white‚Äîdandelions and grass stretched out forever. He was surprised by his own imagination. If I close my eyes tight enough and open them again, he thought, this will all be gone. So, he didn‚Äôt close them.

He looped around the big tree that somehow felt even larger this time. As he walked, he scanned the rest of the area‚Äîonly grass. No other trees, no houses, no animals. That struck him as odd. There were no birds chirping, no buzzing bugs‚Äîjust the breeze and the rustling of leaves.

As he rounded the tree, his heart nearly stopped.

A huge lake sprawled out before him, stretching as far as he could see. The water was completely still. When he walked closer, he couldn‚Äôt see through it. It was like a mirror. In it, he saw clouds, the sun‚Äîand his own reflection. But something was different.

His reflection smiled back at him, wearing clean clothes and a big grin.

Startled, he stumbled backward and hit a root, landing hard on the grass. He dug his hands into the earth. No worms, no dirt‚Äîjust more grass. He pulled and pulled until his fingers were green and his nails packed with grass. His breathing sped up, sweat forming on his brow.

Enough, he thought, and shut his eyes tightly. He waited. Then opened them.

The lake was in front of him still, the torn-up grass was all over his shoes. His eyes started to water. He wiped away the tears and decided it must be the hollow. He popped up, brushed himself off, and before he could turn around, he heard it.

The voice that made his heart plop into his stomach.

‚ÄúOh, there you are.‚Äù

He turned around slowly, unsure of what to do. He could run. But where? He could scream. Who would hear it? The first thing he saw was an unlaced tie and a white dress shirt. Black pants and freshly polished black shoes. The boy moved his eyes up to the man‚Äôs face. He had green eyes and dark hair, a freshly shaved face with a friendly smile on his lips.

The boy said, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

There was a pause. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been looking for you all over. My wife‚Äîshe was worried we wouldn‚Äôt be able to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you know me?‚Äù

A pause.

The man chuckled and said, ‚ÄúWell, we figured if we left this pie out long enough, you‚Äôd be coming over looking for a slice. Would you like one?‚Äù

The boy wanted to run at first. It didn‚Äôt matter where‚Äîhe just knew he should be afraid. But he wasn‚Äôt. There was a sense of warmth filling his body, and he couldn‚Äôt help but want a slice.

He hesitated and said, ‚ÄúWhere do you live?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight around the tree! But I‚Äôm sure you know not to go into strangers‚Äô houses‚Äîyou look like a smart boy. I‚Äôll go grab the pie and my wife. She can‚Äôt wait to see you. You can have some fruit in the meantime.‚Äù

The man walked behind the tree, and the boy watched until the man was gone.
A few moments passed, and he mustered up the courage to move. He figured he would find the hollow and go back home. As he was making his way around the tree, he could smell the pie again. It was stronger this time. His stomach started gurgling and twisting.

When he got to the other side, he couldn‚Äôt believe it.

The man wasn‚Äôt lying.

Right in front of the hollow lay a checkered blanket with a big pitcher of lemonade and a picnic basket filled with apples and grapes. A plate of bread sat there, and it filled his nose with the scent of fresh baking.

Out of instinct, he ran over to the blanket, plopped down, and was about to grab a piece of bread when he hesitated.

What if it‚Äôs poisoned? What if it‚Äôs not real? What if none of this is real?

That made his eyes water again. Before he could wipe them, he heard a soft voice. A woman‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúOh, there he is! You look so handsome today!‚Äù

She wore a white dress with blue flowers on it. She was barefoot and had shoulder-length light brown hair and red lipstick. Her smile was warm and inviting, and in her hands was the pie.

‚ÄúI know you must be starving. Have some fruit and bread. Then after, you can have as many slices as you want. I know that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here.‚Äù She gave an assuring smile just as the man came back with a duffle bag. He put it down next to the blanket and sat. He grabbed a piece of bread, cut it in half, and buttered it up.

The man noticed that the boy wouldn‚Äôt take his eyes off the bag, so he said, ‚ÄúOh, that? It‚Äôs for after lunch. I have a surprise for you.‚Äù

He thought nothing tasted better than the bread‚Ä¶ until he had the fruit. The grapes were fat, green, and exploded with flavor every time he bit into one. If this wasn‚Äôt real, then he didn‚Äôt want to live in the real world. He wanted this‚Äîalways.

The boy was still hesitant of the adults, and he mostly kept quiet during lunch. Every now and then he would lock eyes with the lady. She would smile, and he would look away.

When the time came for the lady to cut into the pie, he realized he must‚Äôve eaten too much, because he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to take a bite. This was all he wanted a moment ago. Now the smell of it made him want to barf.

The woman didn‚Äôt get upset or tell him he had to eat it. She just smiled gently and said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to eat it now. We can always save it for later. I think he‚Äôs ready for you now.‚Äù

The boy looked over to where the man had been sitting‚Äîbut he wasn‚Äôt there. The bag was gone too.

Then he heard a whistle.

He looked over, and the man was standing there with two baseball mitts and a ball.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how good your arm is, bud!‚Äù the man said with pure joy in his eyes.

The boy looked to the lady and put his head down.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? You don‚Äôt like baseball?‚Äù Her voice was soft and low, as if she could feel what he was feeling.

Before he could respond, she added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. He‚Äôll teach you. Go have fun.‚Äù

She started to clean up the picnic area, and the boy nervously walked over toward the man.

The glove was a perfect fit. He had to be shown how to put it on, how to throw the ball, and how to catch it with the glove. But it all came easily to him. Within minutes, he was catching the ball and smiling.

The man never got angry, never cursed when the boy dropped the ball. He just told him to try again and gave him tips on what to do. They were making jokes and laughing. The boy felt like he could do this forever.

As the sun began to set, the man looked down at his wrist and said, ‚ÄúOh, we better get inside soon. She should have supper ready by now.‚Äù

Supper? Didn‚Äôt we just have lunch? the boy thought. But his stomach was grumbling again at the mention of more food.

‚ÄúWhere do you live?‚Äù he asked.

The man chuckled. ‚ÄúRight behind you, silly. You haven‚Äôt noticed our home yet?‚Äù

The boy turned around.

Right where the picnic blanket had been, now stood a big white house with a green door. There was a garden in the front yard, filled with bright-colored flowers of all kinds.

As they walked up the porch steps, the man looked down and said, ‚ÄúOh. Your shoes‚Äîyou should take those off here. They‚Äôve got grass all over them. And they‚Äôre in bad shape. I have a pair for you.‚Äù

The boy took his shoes off and followed the man into the house.

He sat on the couch in the living room, waiting. The smell of supper filled the air and made his mouth water. The man returned, sitting at the coffee table with a shoebox on his lap. He opened it.

‚ÄúHere, these are your size.‚Äù

The boy looked inside. White shoes with red trim. Brand new.

He looked down.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wear these‚Ä¶ they have laces.‚Äù

The man looked confused. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt? Hmm. We‚Äôll have to see about that.‚Äù

He put one of the shoes on the boy‚Äôs foot and said, ‚ÄúWatch closely.‚Äù He began to tie the laces slowly, explaining each step so the boy could follow. Then he put the other shoe on and handed the laces to him.

‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs your turn,‚Äù he said, smiling.

The boy‚Äôs heart started to thump again. He couldn‚Äôt do it. He just knew he couldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúI believe in you, buddy,‚Äù the man said, as if reading his thoughts.

The boy tried.

Then he tried again.

And then‚Äîhe did it. He really did it. He tied his own shoe!

‚ÄúLook at that. You did that all on your own. I‚Äôm really proud of you, bud.‚Äù

Something was happening inside him. He started to breathe heavy, and his eyes began to water‚Äîbut he wasn‚Äôt sad. He looked up at the man. Before he could say anything, the man smiled and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go eat. You can tell her what you just did.‚Äù
Supper was fantastic. Every bite was better than the last, and to top it off‚Äîthere was still pie left. This time, he couldn‚Äôt stop eating it. He must have had at least three slices.

The woman laughed and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really building up an appetite. I‚Äôm glad.‚Äù

That night, she tucked him into bed.

He had a room here. His own room.

There were superhero posters on the walls, a box full of toys, and a shelf loaded with picture books and comics. He picked one before bed and flipped through the pages, studying the images as his eyelids grew heavy.

She sat next to him for a moment and watched. He noticed tears on her face, and his chest tightened.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù he asked.

She smiled and wiped her face. ‚ÄúNothing. Nothing at all. I‚Äôm just glad I get to see you today. Tell me about the story you‚Äôre reading.‚Äù

He looked back at the pages and said, ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs superheroes, and they‚Äôre fighting, but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what it says.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Maybe I can help.‚Äù

She laid next to him and began teaching him some of the words.

He fell asleep quickly. The feel of freshly cleaned sheets, the quiet neatness of the room‚Äîit was cozy. Safe.

But when he woke the next morning, something felt different.

The sheets didn‚Äôt feel the same. There was an odd smell. He heard the ruckus of kids and adults downstairs.

When he opened his eyes, he saw the bottom of a second bunk above him. He dug his face into the pillow.

This time, he couldn‚Äôt wipe the tears away.

After school, he ran to the tree.

His thoughts were running wild as he saw it in the distance.

What if I can‚Äôt find them?

What if they don‚Äôt want me anymore?

What if they‚Äôre not real?

He shook his head hard as he ran, as if to knock the thoughts loose. When he reached the tree, he saw the hole he had made yesterday. The brown grass. The smell of rotten eggs.

That was real.

He walked around the tree and saw the hollow. Something seemed different. It looked smaller. He was almost afraid he wouldn‚Äôt fit.

The inside wasn‚Äôt red anymore. It matched the rest of the tree‚Äîdark brown.

He sat on his butt, back facing the tree, and scooted inside the hollow. He could feel the bark scraping his arms, and he had to duck his head to fit. He closed his eyes.

When he opened them, he saw the brown grass.

He tried again. And again.

He screamed and thrashed inside the hollow. The bark scratched his arm, and he saw blood. He crawled out and cried.

He knew it was too good. He knew it wasn‚Äôt real‚Äîbut he had fought to believe. He really did believe.

That‚Äôs what hurt the most.

He sat under the tree for a long time. His shirt was soaked from wiping his face. His head hurt. His eyes burned.

Finally, he stood, took a deep breath, and began to leave.

Then he froze.

A whistle.

He turned around‚Äîbut saw nothing.

He slowly walked toward the tree. To his surprise, the hollow was gone. As if it had never been there.

Lying in front of the tree, in the same spot where the picnic blanket had been, was a duffle bag.

He ran over to it and unzipped it.

Inside was a ball and glove. And a new pair of sneakers with untied laces.

His eyes filled with tears again.

He let them fall.

He sat down, slipped on the shoes, and tried to tie them.",1,1745851915.0,DestructiveReaders,1,0.99,False

DIGESTION. MIRALAX. Slow recovery. 

I posted recently on here and got some helpful responses, so thought I‚Äôd go again! I‚Äôm just past three weeks out of a TFMR at 14 weeks. I am 43. My digestion still seems slow and it‚Äôs tough to eat enough food, because my tummy gets full and tight quickly. I am currently taking:

-one dose of miralax at night and a 1 unisom, because it helps me sleep. This is week 5 of miralax and unisom(I started taking them at 12 weeks pregnant, when digestion became an issue and since that carried over after the TFMR, kept the routine). 

-I poop once in the morning, before I even have coffee, so I have to assume it‚Äôs the Miralax(it‚Äôs always soft and less formed than normal pre-pregnancy movements). After the morning I am unable to go later in the day. It always feels like I have not completely emptied. If I do happen to go AT ALL after the AM, it‚Äôs always very, very small and pathetic amounts. They are not particularly hard stools, so I don‚Äôt really understand why I can‚Äôt just easily go, if it‚Äôs not hardü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Is it possible this is all hormonal? The past week I have also been getting big waves of emotion/crying. Had NO CLUE this body stuff would go on this long. It is very challenging!

I had some bleeding the first two days after the procedure, then minimal spotting for just a few days. Now I just have some brown discharge when I wipe, but no need for pads/tampons. Cramping was minimal. My doc says this sounds like normal healing, so I‚Äôm at least looking good on that front!

Did anyone else follow a similar recovery pattern? Maybe it will improve after my first period? I‚Äôm really hung up about still using Miralax, but my doc says not to worry about it, if it‚Äôs helping. She also prescribed me a topical compound called Diltaziem. She thinks it may help some of my rectal muscles relax. It‚Äôs mostly used for healing anal fissures, but she thinks it may help. I‚Äôm scared to use it, because I‚Äôm worried it may burn/itch(I‚Äôve read this is fairly common) and my bandwidth is so small these days that I‚Äôm worried it will be such a horrible distraction among all the other discomfort. But also‚Ä¶it may help?  

ANYWAY‚Ä¶would love to hear from even more women who can relate! Did this just take time? Maybe it‚Äôs my age? Perhaps also being 14 weeks pregnant at the time of termination means things will take longer? Blah blah blah‚Ä¶looking for relatability and comfort!

Sending love to you all! Sorry we are here. We will heal‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π",4,1745851791.0,tfmr_support,2,1.0,False

I've finally had enough. Besides it costing too much money, I am worried about my health. Nothing has happened so far, but I've lost tons of sleep and have a lot of anxiety.

Apparently I've been ingesting close to 1g of caffeine per day by the looks of it.

For example, today I've already had two venti Starbucks coffees, and here is their info on their website about it's caffeine content:

390 mg - 490 mg\*\*

Today I took the plunge and bought a 28-day product to help me wean off of caffeine slowly but surely. It starts off at 550 mg and every 3 days decreases until you eventually hit zero.

Most people heading to the Philippines immediately think of Palawan or Boracay, but if you want a mix of surfing, caf√© hopping, and chill beach vibes without needing to take a flight, La Union (or ""Elyu"" to locals) is such a hidden gem. üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

üìç Location: Just about a 4-5 hour drive north of Manila (you can rent a van, car, or ride a bus).

üåä Why Go:
Surfing Capital: San Juan Beach is perfect for both beginners and seasoned surfers.
Sunsets: The sunsets here are unreal ‚Äî fiery orange skies over the ocean!
Caf√© Culture: Tons of beachfront cafes and creative spots ‚Äî try El Union Coffee, Clean Beach, and Kabsat.
Laidback Nightlife: Chill bars with live music, not the crazy party scene but still lively.
Arts and Culture: Surf towns meet art communities; there are small galleries and mural art around.

üõèÔ∏è Where to Stay:
Budget: Circle Hostel (perfect for solo travelers!)
Midrange: Aureo La Union or Flotsam and Jetsam (popular artsy boutique stay)
Luxury: Thunderbird Resorts (Greek-style hotel with full amenities).

üç¥ Food Tip: Try the local bagnet (crispy pork belly) and halo-halo for dessert after a long surf day.

üóìÔ∏è Best Time to Visit:
November to March = surf season
April to June = hot summer beach season
(July‚ÄìOctober is typhoon season, so best to avoid if you don't like rain.)
Highly recommend La Union if you want a relaxed beach town experience without having to hop on a plane. üå¥

Every time I set up the wirsh CM5418 Espresso Machine in my kitchen, it feels like I'm blending caf√© vibes with sleek modernity. This machine's stainless-steel body not only screams durability but also adds a polished touch to my countertop without gobbling too much space. Its compact dimensions of 12.2""D x 5.5""W x 11.9""H make it perfect for smaller kitchens, especially if you're like me and don't want appliances bumping elbows. The indicator lights are a small yet handy feature that keeps me aware of its functions‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm pulling an espresso shot or steaming milk.  

[Time to see wirsh CM5418 cost on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08x627458/)  

**Brew Like a Barista**  

What truly makes this espresso maker stand out is its ability to cater to both the professional and the amateur. I‚Äôve spent countless mornings experimenting with its 20-bar Italian pump system, and the results have been consistently satisfying‚Äîit extracts rich and flavorful espresso shots that rival those in my favorite coffee shop. The two-in-one portafilter allows me to switch effortlessly between single and double shots, which is great because my roommate and I each have our unique coffee strength preferences. Interestingly, even the steam wand feels like a commercial-grade tool! Frothing milk for a latte felt intuitive, and it's capable enough for impressive artful attempts. Pro tip: using a small stainless-steel jug helps.  

**User-Friendly Features**  

Simplicity goes a long way, and this machine excels at it. With just a few buttons and dials, there's no complicated learning curve. My aunt loved it when she visited, as she could brew her cup without fumbling with a confusing interface. The 42 oz removable water tank is another spot-on detail‚Äîrefilling and cleaning it is incredibly easy. However, I did notice its lightweight design caused it to slide around occasionally when locking the portafilter in place. You‚Äôll want to stabilize it with one hand while attaching since it lacks the heft of pricier models.  

**Advantages**  

- Compact and stylish stainless-steel design.  
- User-friendly with straightforward controls.  
- Rich espresso extraction with a 20-bar pump.  
- Versatile steam wand for milk frothing.   
- Large water tank ensures fewer refills during use.  

**Negatives**  

- Lightweight body can slide on counters.  
- No adjustable water temperature settings.  
- Limited space for taller mugs or cups.  

**Performance Under Pressure**  

With its 1350W instant thermo-block heating system, I‚Äôve found the wirsh espresso machine preheats impressively fast‚Äîaround 15 seconds or so. This is a lifesaver when I‚Äôm rushing during weekday mornings. However, there‚Äôs one small caveat to bear in mind. Once you use the steam wand, the cooling process for returning to espresso-making mode can take a bit of time. Luckily, there‚Äôs a workaround: ejecting hot water from the wand helps speed up the process. It wastes some water, but if you‚Äôre impatient like me, this trick comes in clutch.  

**Other Options**  

While testing this machine, I couldn‚Äôt help but compare it to some heavyweights in the market, like the Breville Bambino or the popular De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica. Those models often pack additional features, such as auto-shutoff or more precise temperature controls. However, they also come with a heftier price tag. For its cost, the wirsh CM5418 holds up incredibly well, delivering quality espresso without the bells and whistles of premium competitors. That said, the lightweight design and lack of advanced features might leave experienced users craving more.  

**Money‚Äôs Worth**  

This espresso machine strikes a fine balance between affordability and performance. Its stainless-steel design, functional steam wand, and reliable espresso shots prove it's a solid investment for coffee enthusiasts who don‚Äôt want to splurge on high-end devices. I‚Äôd say beginners or casual users will find it incredibly satisfying for its price, while seasoned baristas might consider it more of a backup.

1k9xakl,https://i.redd.it/8hlu6a7v8lxe1.jpeg,Should I upgrade my ender 3 v3 se to ke or k1c? Or just mod it?,"Started 3d printing 10 days ago with an original 3 v3 se. What I modded
- dual 5015 fan blower
- maglev 4020 fan for hot end
- removed original screen
- raspberry pi 4b and klipper
- Logitech c920 for time lapse
- some 3d printed parts
Want to do next:
- gantry 
- ceramic hotend
- x-axis rail
But at this point I wonder should I keep modding or buy a new machine (budget $500)? I only print PETG (gridfinity, coffee machine gadget) and PLA (small figure for my little kids, they love painting them). I haven't purchased new machine mainly because I love klipper so much and want to use my own webcam to record printing time lapse, I'll add some other webcam to watch in multiple angles. I did some research and  I think that k1c, v3 ke don't have enough power for 2,3 cameras.  I want to print with faster speed, maybe better quality, I don't want multiple colors or different filaments. Please help me on what to do next?

The morning sun filtered through the half-drawn curtains, casting long, golden lines across the hardwood floor. Outside, a gentle breeze swayed the branches of the maple tree, leaves rustling softly like whispers of an old secret. Inside, the house was quiet except for the occasional creak of settling wood and the rhythmic ticking of the antique clock on the mantel. In the kitchen, the faint smell of coffee lingered in the air, mingling with the scent of fresh bread cooling on the counter.

She sat at the table, her hands wrapped around a warm mug, eyes unfocused as she stared through the window. The world felt slower here‚Äîless urgent. A small bird hopped along the edge of the porch, tilting its head curiously before fluttering away. There was a peace in the mundane details of the day, a comfort in the predictable rhythm of morning rituals.

Books lay scattered across the table, some open, some closed, their spines worn with use. A notebook sat nearby, its pages filled with scribbled thoughts, unfinished stories, and occasional doodles in the margins. She turned to a clean page and tapped her pen against it thoughtfully, then began to write.

Words came slowly at first, like drops from a leaky faucet, but soon they gathered momentum, flowing steadily. She didn‚Äôt know exactly what the story would be about‚Äîonly that it started with a journey, a small boat on a wide river, and a sky that promised both rain and sunlight.

Outside, a distant rumble of thunder broke the silence, and the clouds began to gather. She smiled, not minding the storm. Some days were meant for rain and quiet creation.

I had a thread of UTIs last year, four total, and I just had another this year. They seem to be caused by a mix of things, typically alcohol and intercourse. Now that I got one I am worried I will get more so I am looking into things I can change in my lifestyle to prevent them. So far I have cut out most sugar, I switched to mainly tea instead of coffee, I take probiotics and a uti supplement every day, d-mannose after intercourse, and I only wear cotton undies.

What I want to ask is primarily:

-What do you guys workout in? I only have tight leggings, if those get sweaty is that risky?

-I cut back drinking, but if I were to drink alcohol, what is ""safest""? Or even any diets that you recommend, I heard keto helps.

-Lastly, any teas or even herbal remedies recommendations? I love tea and have heard green tea and dandelion tea are good for UTI prevention. 

Let me know any tips you have found work, I quite literally cannot handle another UTI, they are so debilitating and cause me to miss work. ü•≤üíï",2,1745851474.0,utis,0,1.0,False

I started researching nurse mental health during my graduate semester back in 2019. Then COVID hit and I worked frontlines in a downtown CA hospital. Got totally wrecked and changed from ICU/ER to other genres and even CNO. 
This whole time I‚Äôve still been continuing my research into nursing mental health. It‚Äôs a main theme in my doctorate project right now actually. 
I started an educational platform back in 2021 and did everything from friendly ACLS/BLS and Code training to CEUs etc. When stuff got really busy with work and graduate school I stopped doing that as much but always wanted to do a podcast. 

I started the podcast in January and it‚Äôs been amazing and something I  love doing. It‚Äôs a short form podcast all about nursing mental health and resilience but with actually helpful topics and skills. I even have some meditations up. I did it this way because I loved podcasts especially while commuting to work but they were so long I always had to stop at weird points and then couldn‚Äôt get back into it a lot of times.  It‚Äôs irreverent and sassy and has some holistic vibes to it as well. Basically the whole point is putting nurses first and protecting OUR peace. NOT teaching nurses how to withstand more abuse from a broken healthcare system. I‚Äôm basically teaching nurses all the skills (DBT Based, trauma informed care) that I wish to god someone had given me before I started in the ICU a decade and a half ago. 

I‚Äôm not a health coach or anything. I‚Äôm not affiliated with anything. I‚Äôm trying to get more of my stuff affiliated with the state board but that‚Äôs a different thing. Everything is based on my research over the last five years. 

I‚Äôd really love feedback. I just started a TikTok for it and have no idea what I‚Äôm doing on it. I feel like new grad lmao. My whole goal is to help nurses who suffered like I did or are currently feeling like I did, heal and develop the skills to protect their peace for THEIR benefit not the healthcare systems. Nursing is massive and we should be wherever we thrive not being crushed by hospitals that see us as supplies. If bedside is where our passion is then at least we have the skills to protect ourselves! 
The podcast is called The Ritual Nurse. I‚Äôm on all platforms for free. Warning it can be sassy and dark humor sometimes LOL and I do have a segment called Coffee, Crystals, and Divination. But I‚Äôm always science first and foremost. ",0,1745851390.0,nursing,0,0.5,False

Hit the comments and I‚Äôll send it fast!

After being given a second chance at life, the first thing I did was divorce the celebrated actor, Dean Mills, and instead chose to marry his supposedly aloof younger uncle, Bryan Mills.

In my previous life, during the five years of my secret marriage to Dean, I once dared to mention wanting a child. His response was to call me shameless and then unceremoniously assign me as an assistant to Anais Parker, his brother's widow. Caught meeting Anais late at night, Dean pressured me into testifying that it was merely a promotional event for a new film. Even when they were seen signing autographs at a gala or kissing on set, they simply brushed it off as part of their professional collaboration.

I had my suspicions, but my love for him ran so deep that I chose to trust him. It wasn't until I stumbled upon the backside of a secretly-taken wedding photo of Dean and Anais, scribbled with his heartfelt confessions to her, that I realized they had long been in love.

In this life, as a special guest on a reality show, when the host challenged me to kiss someone I found intriguing for ten seconds, I stood on my toes and kissed Bryan's cheek. Dean's expression immediately soured.

‚Ä¶

A few seconds of silence followed, only to be broken by a wave of cheers across the recording set. Dean's eyes were dark with anger. If it weren't for the cameras still rolling, he might have confronted me right then and there.

The host was surprised by my move and inquired why I chose to kiss Bryan. I returned to my seat, speaking casually.

""The rules were clear. If you lose, you have to kiss any male guest present, and I simply picked at random.""

Bryan glanced at me without commenting, but Dean‚Äôs expression darkened further, prompting him to abruptly call for a break.

During the intermission, Dean reclined on the sofa with his eyes closed, his voice cold and composed.

""Laura, don't forget you're a married woman. If it weren't for the producers' respect for you, a social media writer of questionable reputation, you wouldn't even be here. Know your place, understand? Don‚Äôt test my patience with stunts like this.""

I calmly looked at the friend request notification on my phone, my face serene.

""You insisted on keeping our marriage a secret. Among all the male guests here, you're the only ones I know. If I kissed you, who knows how many people would criticize me tonight. Why would I choose such a thankless task?""

He furrowed his brows and gave me a few scrutinizing glances, then let out a derisive snort.

""At least you know your limits.""

He then habitually reached for his insulated mug, only to frown deeply when he opened it.

""Where's the coffee? You know my throat's been sore these past few days.""

I absentmindedly fiddled with my phone, unconcerned.

""I forgot.""

For years, whenever Dean worked, I'd prepare various herbal remedies to soothe him when he felt weary. In my past life, doing these things became second nature, never feeling like a burden. Now, it seemed unnecessary.

His brows knitted tighter at my words, and just as he was about to inquire further, there was a knock at the door, and Anais entered with a small spiced honey cake, smiling brightly.

""Knowing you were tired, I had my agent get you some dessert. There are a few hours left of recording, so quickly replenish your energy.""

Dean's face broke into a smile upon seeing her. He stood up, took the cake, and immediately dug in.

""This is delicious, Anais. Would you like some too?""

Anais playfully tapped his nose.

""Still not calling me sister-in-law, you really have no manners.""

As if she only just noticed me in the corner, Anais uttered an exaggerated ""oh.""

""Sorry, Laura, I forgot you were here today. Otherwise, I would have bought you one too.""

Dean, still eating his cake, didn‚Äôt pause or miss a beat in his mocking tone.

""She's only here because of my influence. Why bother about her? The director said today's focus is our new film.""

Anais chuckled and sat close to Dean. The two of them chatted intimately, making it impossible for anyone to tell Anais was Dean's sister-in-law. After marrying Dean's brother, Anais entered showbiz shortly after her husband's untimely death from illness.

Back then, Dean was already fairly well-known and, despite his status, invited her to several shoots, significantly boosting her career. In my previous life, I merely thought he was looking out for family. Now I see, the depth of their feelings was never truly hidden.

After a while, Anais brought up a concern with a slight frown.

""What to do, Dean? My assistant is sick lately, and I've got no one to help me. I even have to brew my own coffee, it's such a hassle.""

Dean‚Äôs brow creased.

""That won't do, you have such a delicate constitution, you need someone to take care of you.""

After pondering for a bit, he turned his attention to me.

""Laura, why don't you help Anais out as her assistant? You're at home with nothing better to do anyway; you might as well help Anais.""

Anais's voice held a trace of reluctance.

""This doesn‚Äôt seem right; she's your wife, after all.""

""So what? We're family, it's only right to help out. Besides, she‚Äôs got no objections, or she‚Äôd just be freeloading.""

His commanding tone mirrored echoes of my past life. Back then, the reason was even more absurd. Merely because I mentioned wanting a child, he loudly cursed me for being shameless and forced me to become Anais‚Äôs assistant.

But now, naturally, I was unwilling.

Just as I was about to refuse, Dean suddenly looked towards the door and stood up abruptly.

During my last manic episode I did a lot of horrible things. However, the one I‚Äôm grappling with the hardest is being obsessed with a woman I was cheating with. What‚Äôs very odd to me is this would never be my type of person when non-manic. 

My therapist explained to me that each of his BP patients who‚Äôve been manic have had manic obsessions. He assured me, if it wasn‚Äôt this girl, it would be someone or something else. And looking back, it is often seemingly random or strange. 

Additionally, this person seemingly must have been obsessed with me as well and I‚Äôm wondering if she‚Äôs also BP. I have a letter she wrote me after only three days of talking that was about us being in love and how this was God‚Äôs perfecting timing and his plan. This was also fire to my manic fuel, as I was hearing the voice of God and even believed I saw a demon at one point. Now, with medication and no longer being manic, I feel basically nothing for this person. But if I drink a bit too much coffee or feel a little bit hypo at times, I get a wave of feeling for her again. It‚Äôs freaking me out if I‚Äôm being honest. 

I hate feeling ashamed and horrified by the fact I cheated on my wife due to hypersexuality combined with a manic obsession. What makes it worse is, as my medication hasn‚Äôt fully kicked in yet, I get waves of going back to that mental place.

Taking it out on a morning walk with my niece was genuinely a pleasure. The high landscape design was one of my favorite features, as it kept her elevated and away from vehicle emissions. It‚Äôs also ideal for giving curious little ones a better view of the world around them. That extra height brought peace of mind in busy areas and made me feel like she was in a safer space.

**Performance and Maneuverability**  
Handling this stroller is an enjoyable experience. The four EVA wheels paired with the spring suspension system passed my ‚Äúuneven neighborhood sidewalks‚Äù test with flying colors. The ability to lock the rear wheels with a single step felt incredibly practical, especially when making quick stops by a coffee cart or loading groceries.  

Adjustable features include a backrest that tilts between 105¬∞ to 145¬∞ and a pedal adjustable to three positions, ensuring comfort as your baby naps or remains upright to engage with the surroundings. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the zipper canopy with a peekaboo window‚ÄîI had way too much fun checking on my little passenger through that adorable gap!  

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Sturdy alloy steel frame for durability.  
- High landscape design protects from car exhaust levels.  
- Smooth wheel suspension makes it adaptable to bumpy surfaces.  
- Slim foldable design is great for storing in compact spaces.  
- Adjustable backrest and canopy cater to sleeping or alert babies.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The stroller could benefit from a car seat compatibility option for seamless transitions.  
- Storage basket is spacious, but accessing it when fully reclined is a minor challenge.  
- Folding it with one hand isn‚Äôt always as intuitive as it seems in descriptions.  

**Comfort for Baby and Caregiver**  
Safety and comfort were clearly in mind here, with core highlights like the 5-point safety harness securing a little one firmly without being restrictive. On cold days, the detachable footmuff shielded from the bitter wind, though it‚Äôs easily removable during hotter days. The cushioning in the seat felt luxurious yet breathable‚Äîa win-win considering how sweaty babies can get during long stroller rides during summer!  

For me, pushing this stroller was a breeze. The leather handrail adds a soft, ergonomic touch, so I didn‚Äôt feel sore wrists after extended use. Extra nifty for parents or caregivers is the storage bag behind the backseat; great for stashing keys, wipes, or small toys at arm‚Äôs reach.  

**Product Rivals**  
Compared to other strollers like the UPPAbaby MINU and Chicco Bravo, this one seems to excel on sturdiness without being bulky. Some premium strollers can feel heavy or overly complicated when folding, but the balance here between lightweight design and durability impressed me. That said, I would give a nod to Chicco for its slightly easier one-hand folding mechanism, while UPPAbaby caters to parents wanting car seat integration. What‚Äôs key about the BABY JOY 754A though, is its affordability while still nailing the multi-adjustable features and overall quality.  

**Value for Money**  
For a product that delivers comfort, maneuverability, and durability, the price point is reasonable in my eyes. More budget-friendly than several upscale brands, it still checks many of the same boxes, from adjustable backrests to stylish aesthetics. Whether you‚Äôre strolling through a park or tackling shopping errands in the city, it makes sense to invest in a product like this that blends cost-effectiveness with essential features so seamlessly.

Yesterday, my kid (I'll call them K) went to use the restroom. They use the family bathroom because it is for any gender. Looking at K, if you dont know them, they look like a 14 - 16 year old boy.

As they got to the bathroom, an older man (65 ish) came out of the men's room. He walked right up behind K. K ran into the family bathroom, pushed the door closed, and locked it. Not a moment later this guy tried to open the door.

Now K is texting me but I'm with a customer so I dont see it. After the customer walks away I check my phone because K has been gone about 5 mins and Im like ???

I see the texts but the guy is a few feet away from the bathroom so at first I thought they were over reacting. As I'm watching however,  he goes over and asks an employee to open the door, then tries the handle again and *pounds* on the door  full force.

I throw my apron off and run over. I call through the door that it's me. I maneuvered to block him from seeing K and K comes out. 

""He's been in there 15 minutes""
Me: he ain't been gone no 15 minutes
""The fuck he hasnt""
Me: well pounding on the door really helped didnt it??

The guy watches us walk back to the caf√© and then goes into the bathroom.

Keep in mind he had just left the men's room, and that he watched K go in and then immediately tried the door. When he came out we have supervisors with us so he knew we told them. He walked around the store and then stared at K the whole time he was cashing out. I was *ready* but he didnt come over.

Yes, we reported everything. K was given the option to press charges but didnt really want the guy provoked any further. However if he returns to the store security will be watching. 

Edit: thank you for the support/concern. K is okay. They clocked out early last night and cried a good long while. They're working today but their fiance (a big ole cis man) went with them and will attend if K uses the rest room. They're gonna use the employee bathroom from now on (we usually dont because it is further away, and usually busy because it's 1 toilet for like 100 people) to avoid any more customers. 

We are thinking the guy wanted to assault K because he tried to open the door quietly at first but got angry when it was locked. As he'd just come out the men's room he obviously didn't have to pee. He saw what he thought was a young boy alone and went for it. ",510,1745851097.0,TwoXChromosomes,42,0.93,False

If you‚Äôve ever struggled with dropped VoIP calls, poor audio quality, or strange connectivity issues, you‚Äôve probably encountered the invisible villain of VoIP:¬†**SIP ALG**. This mysterious setting, lurking in many routers, is responsible for sabotaging countless VoIP systems. But what exactly is SIP ALG, and why does it cause so much trouble?

Let‚Äôs break it down, explain why we despise it, and most importantly, what you can do to stop it from ruining your VoIP experience.

¬†

# What is SIP ALG?

SIP ALG stands for¬†**Session Initiation Protocol Application Layer Gateway**. It‚Äôs a feature built into many routers, designed with good intentions but often causing more harm than good. To understand SIP ALG, let‚Äôs first look at¬†**SIP** itself.

SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is the signaling protocol VoIP systems use to set up, manage, and tear down voice or video calls. Think of SIP as the¬†**call coordinator**‚Äîit ensures that your phone knows when to ring, where to send the audio, and how to end the call.

SIP ALG is supposed to help VoIP traffic pass through firewalls and Network Address Translation (NAT) by modifying SIP packets as they travel between your device and your VoIP provider. The goal is to resolve compatibility issues caused by firewalls or NAT.

Sounds helpful, right? Not so fast. SIP ALG is the classic case of good intentions gone wrong.

¬†

# Why Do We Hate SIP ALG?

To put it simply, SIP ALG often makes things worse. Instead of smoothing the path for VoIP traffic, it mangles the SIP packets, creating problems like:

# 1. Dropped Calls

Imagine SIP ALG as a well-meaning but clumsy waiter delivering your coffee. Instead of carrying it smoothly to your table, they spill half of it on the floor. Similarly, SIP ALG interferes with SIP packets, often causing calls to drop mid-conversation.

# 2. One-Way Audio

Ever been on a VoIP call where you can hear the other person, but they can‚Äôt hear you (or vice versa)? That‚Äôs SIP ALG working its ""magic."" By modifying SIP packets incorrectly, it can block parts of the voice data (RTP packets), leading to one-way audio issues.

# 3. Registration Failures

VoIP phones and systems need to register with the VoIP server to make and receive calls. SIP ALG sometimes modifies the SIP headers incorrectly, causing registration to fail. In other words, your VoIP device might not even connect to the service properly.

# 4. Endless Troubleshooting

Perhaps the most frustrating part about SIP ALG is that it makes diagnosing VoIP issues harder. You might think the problem is with your internet connection, your VoIP provider, or even your hardware, when in reality, SIP ALG is quietly wreaking havoc in the background.

¬†

# Why Does SIP ALG Exist?

You might wonder, if SIP ALG is so bad, why do routers even have it? SIP ALG was created to address real challenges with VoIP traffic, particularly with NAT (Network Address Translation). NAT allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address, which can sometimes make it difficult for VoIP traffic to find its way back to the correct device.

In theory, SIP ALG should fix these problems by inspecting and rewriting SIP packets to ensure they pass through NAT correctly. In practice, it often gets things wrong, leading to the issues we‚Äôve described.

¬†

# How to Check if SIP ALG is Causing Problems

If you suspect SIP ALG is to blame for your VoIP troubles, here are a few telltale signs:

* Frequent¬†**dropped calls** or call disconnections.
* **One-way audio** where one party can‚Äôt hear the other.
* VoIP devices failing to¬†**register** with the server.
* Difficulty making or receiving calls, even when your internet connection is stable.

To confirm that SIP ALG is the culprit, try disabling it (we‚Äôll explain how below) and see if your VoIP issues improve.

¬†

# How to Disable SIP ALG

Disabling SIP ALG is usually the best way to resolve the problems it causes. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1: Log Into Your Router**

1. Open a web browser and type your router‚Äôs IP address into the address bar (e.g.,¬†192.168.1.1 or¬†192.168.0.1).
2. Enter your router‚Äôs username and password. If you haven‚Äôt changed these, the default credentials are often printed on the router itself.

**Step 2: Locate the SIP ALG Setting**

1. Navigate to the¬†**Advanced Settings** or¬†**Firewall/NAT** section.
2. Look for a setting labeled¬†**SIP ALG** or¬†**SIP Helper**. It might be under ""VoIP Settings"" on some routers.

**Step 3: Disable SIP ALG**

1. Toggle the SIP ALG setting to ""Off"" or ""Disabled.""
2. Save your changes and restart the router to ensure the new settings take effect.

**Step 4: Test Your VoIP System**  
Make a few test calls to see if the issues are resolved. If calls no longer drop or experience audio issues, congratulations‚Äîyou‚Äôve tamed the SIP ALG beast!

¬†

# How to Disable SIP ALG on Popular Routers

If SIP ALG is wreaking havoc on your VoIP system, the good news is that disabling it is usually straightforward. Many routers have SIP ALG enabled by default, but here‚Äôs how to turn it off on three of the most common router brands.

¬†

# 1. Netgear Routers

Netgear routers often come with SIP ALG turned on, which can interfere with your VoIP traffic.

**Steps to Disable SIP ALG on a Netgear Router**:

1. **Log In to the Router**:
   * Open a web browser and go to your router‚Äôs IP address (e.g.,¬†192.168.1.1 or¬†192.168.0.1).
   * Enter your admin username and password. If you haven‚Äôt changed these, check the default credentials on your router label.
2. **Access Advanced Settings**:
   * Navigate to¬†**Advanced** \>¬†**Setup** \>¬†**WAN Setup**.
3. **Disable SIP ALG**:
   * Locate the option labeled¬†**SIP ALG** or¬†**Disable SIP ALG**.
   * Check the box or toggle the setting to turn SIP ALG off.
4. **Save Settings**:
   * Click¬†**Apply** to save your changes.
5. **Restart the Router**:
   * Reboot your router to apply the new settings.

# 2. ASUS Routers

ASUS routers label SIP ALG as¬†**SIP Passthrough**, and it‚Äôs commonly enabled by default.

**Steps to Disable SIP ALG on an ASUS Router**:

1. **Log In to the Router**:
   * In a web browser, type¬†[192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) and log in using your admin credentials (default is often¬†admin/admin).
2. **Go to Advanced Settings**:
   * Navigate to¬†**Advanced Settings** \>¬†**WAN** \>¬†**NAT Passthrough**.
3. **Disable SIP ALG**:
   * Find the option labeled¬†**SIP Passthrough**.
   * Set it to¬†**Disabled**.
4. **Save Changes**:
   * Click¬†**Apply** to save the configuration.
5. **Reboot the Router**:
   * Restart the router for the changes to take effect.

# 3. TP-Link Routers

TP-Link routers, especially older models, also have SIP ALG enabled by default.

**Steps to Disable SIP ALG on a TP-Link Router**:

1. **Log In to the Router**:
   * Open a browser and type¬†192.168.0.1 or¬†192.168.1.1 in the address bar.
   * Use your admin username and password (commonly¬†admin/admin).
2. **Access NAT Settings**:
   * Go to¬†**Advanced** \>¬†**NAT Forwarding** or¬†**Firewall Settings** (this may vary by model).
3. **Disable SIP ALG**:
   * Find the¬†**SIP ALG** option and uncheck it or toggle it off.
4. **Save and Reboot**:
   * Save your changes and restart the router to ensure SIP ALG is fully disabled.

¬†

# What If Disabling SIP ALG Doesn‚Äôt Help?

Disabling SIP ALG resolves most VoIP-related issues, but if you‚Äôre still experiencing problems, here are additional steps:

* **Port Forwarding**: Configure your router to forward SIP (port 5060) and RTP (ports 10000‚Äì20000) traffic to your VoIP devices.
* **Upgrade Your Router**: Older routers may struggle with VoIP traffic even with SIP ALG disabled. Consider investing in a router optimized for VoIP.
* **Contact Your VoIP Provider**: They can guide you through further troubleshooting or recommend specific settings for your system.

¬†

# Why Disabling SIP ALG Makes All the Difference

Once you‚Äôve turned off SIP ALG, you‚Äôll likely notice an immediate improvement in your VoIP system‚Äôs performance. No more dropped calls, one-way audio, or registration failures‚Äîjust smooth, reliable communication. While SIP ALG was intended to help VoIP traffic, it often does more harm than good, which is why disabling it is one of the first steps to troubleshooting VoIP issues.

¬†

# What If Disabling SIP ALG Doesn‚Äôt Help?

If disabling SIP ALG doesn‚Äôt solve the problem, there may be other factors at play. Here are a few additional steps to try:

* **Configure Port Forwarding**: Open the SIP and RTP ports (e.g., 5060 for SIP, 10000-20000 for RTP) in your router‚Äôs firewall settings to allow VoIP traffic through.
* **Use a VoIP-Optimized Router**: Some routers are better suited for VoIP traffic and can handle NAT traversal without relying on SIP ALG.
* **Check with Your VoIP Provider**: They may have specific recommendations for your setup or troubleshooting tools to help identify the issue.

# Conclusion: SIP ALG‚ÄîA Well-Intentioned Villain

SIP ALG was designed to help VoIP systems, but more often than not, it causes frustration instead. From dropped calls to one-way audio and registration failures, its unintended consequences can derail your VoIP experience.

The good news is that disabling SIP ALG is usually a straightforward fix that resolves most related issues. By taking this simple step, you can enjoy smoother, more reliable VoIP communication without the headaches caused by SIP ALG.

So, the next time your VoIP system acts up, don‚Äôt forget to check for SIP ALG. Once you‚Äôve banished this meddlesome setting, you‚Äôll wonder how you ever put up with it in the first place.",1,1745850960.0,Official_1Voice,0,1.0,False

I woke early‚Äîtoo early‚Äîbut the tight pull in my chest and restlessness of my being had been building all night. Sleep never really took. It had felt like my body had already been launched upwards, even if I hadn‚Äôt left the bed yet. There was no hesitation. No second thoughts. Just motion. I was up. Dressed. Focused. And alive.

Breakfast never crossed my mind. I was wired with something stronger than hunger or even the strongest coffee‚Äîsomething deeper. The kind of energy that comes when you know you‚Äôre standing on the edge of everything.

I threw my duffel over one shoulder‚Äîregulation-issue, olive drab, worn soft from three years of hard use. It wasn‚Äôt heavy. Most of what I own could fit inside. It was most of what I‚Äôd¬†*ever*¬†owned, in all honesty.

The uniform was new, though. Fresh, clean and well-tailored.

Smart grey, high-collared, shoulders padded just enough to suggest structure‚Äînot armour. The lines were sharp, confident, but not aggressive. Something made for peacekeepers who might still be called to war.

Stitched to the uniform‚Äôs chest on the left side, shining in starlight. The Helion Vanguard crest was elegant‚Äîan atomic nucleus at its centre, its orbital rings traced by tiny stars, each marking the founding worlds. The nucleus glowed faintly silver under the light, stitched with Graviton curves that hinted at Fold resonance. It wasn‚Äôt just a symbol. It was the equation that changed history‚Äîworn like a vow. It caught the morning light when I shifted, fracturing into star points‚Äîsubtle, but unmistakable. I‚Äôd stared at it the night before, tracing the border with my thumb.

Not for vanity. For proof. That I had made it this far.

\---

The sun had just crested the hills when I stepped out into the stillness of campus. The air was brisk, touched with the salt of San Francisco Bay. I paused at the top of the stairs outside my now old dormitory and looked out across the expansive grounds‚Äîwide, trimmed, and gold-lit in the slanting light. A garden framed the old redwood quad: green, fragrant, organized in clean spirals of native plants and imported blooms from distant sectors.

I had never really stopped to take it all in before. I never really gave it the time.

Groundskeepers were already at work, moving slow and steady through the beds. One of them‚Äîan older man with grey in his beard and dirt on his knees‚Äîlooked up and gave me a nod. I returned it silently, unsure why the gesture hit me so hard. Maybe it was the calm in his face, the kindness in his eyes. Or the way he didn‚Äôt ask where I was going. As if he already knew. Either way, it filled me with saudade‚Äîa quiet nostalgia for what I was leaving behind, and a yearning for what lay ahead. I felt the push of my past and the tug of my future, sharpening my sense of resolve. Earth had shaped me in ways I continually tried to forget‚Äîbut couldn‚Äôt. It was the place I had survived, and now, the place I was finally ready to leave behind.

I walked slower than I meant to at first. Letting my boots crunch over the gravel path listening to the sound. I would miss it in some ways, and I want to remember some of the smaller details. Letting the scent of early roses and sun-warmed pine rise into me. Letting myself¬†*feel*¬†it.

This place¬†*had*¬†been home, even if I hadn‚Äôt called it that. Not out loud.

And now I was leaving it.

\---

The Solari Academy had always been pristine. Designed to impress, to inspire all who visited. Tall white marble structures stood in perfect symmetry, all polished stone and sharp corners. A testament to human ability and precision with a hand and chisel. The walkways were quiet, the air was clean. Statues lined the courtyards: explorers, scientists, officers whose names were etched into metal and marble like prayers. Some were human, some were not. That was not a distinction made here, we all stood in unity. But for humanity, at the centre stood the most prominent:

**Dr. Professor Elia Voss.**

The nuclear physicist who uncovered the¬†**Architect Schematic**‚Äîthe equation and blueprint for building machines capable of generating gravitational wells. Bending spacetime.

A way to create and harness the power of gravity.  
And eventually, the means to bend the fabric of reality itself.

It was written into the bones of all matter and scattered across the universe like starlight. A calling card‚Äîa literal encoded signal inside the heart of every atom. Some called it an echo‚Äîa death's rattle across dimensions. Sent by something older, greater. A higher species pulling on the threads of the lesser, just to say:

**If you can see this. We were here.**  
**And we existed.**

The discovery of the Architects Schematic, a 'morse-code' of data hidden inside every atom in the universe, was the existential suicide of all Earth‚Äôs religions. The undoing of millennia of human philosophy. For theologians, it was a death knell. For philosophers, a rebirth. The new universal constant was in its own, a genesis.

It gave the instructions to create a new technology. Blueprints to build a machine.

Humanity stopped‚Äîevery eye fixed on the headlines in 2043 coming out of CERN in Geneva, as we learned to see it for the first time. We screamed in horror when the prototype machine‚ÄîAlcubierre Alpha‚Äîfirst bent spacetime in 2046, rotating a scar the size of Manhattan deep into the Earth crust‚Äîkilling five hundred of the world‚Äôs leading scientists, including Voss. We watched the sky in esoteric awe as the first ship,¬†*Honoring Voss*, launched in 2051. It was set and crewed for a fifteen-month voyage. It Folded to Jupiter in thirty-seven hours. It came back in six seconds. We travelled to our nearest wormhole‚ÄîGaia BH1 (The Reach)‚Äî1,560 light-years away and a thirty-six-hour journey‚Äîholding our collective breath in 2089 when another,¬†*Genesis VI*, Folded into the blackened beast's heart of churning spacetime and vanished.

And in 2090, seven-thousand years of silence falling upon humanity finally broke.

The cosmos had spoken once again. We were not alone.

On the other side there were twenty other species‚Äîentire civilizations we‚Äôd only dreamed of‚Äîthere, waiting for us to come. Entire worlds, terraformed sectors and interconnected societies with an unfathomable level of technological advancement: the cure of cancer‚Äîways to reverse human-induced climate change on Earth‚Äîthe blueprints for a starship. They welcomed us into the Common Celestial Highway‚Äîan interconnected network of wormholes across galaxies‚Äînot with weapons, but with open hands, claws, and wings, inviting us not just into their systems‚Ä¶ but into their collective arms.

Fermi‚Äôs Paradox was the right question‚Äîjust waiting for the right answer.

No god had spoken to humanity. But the Universe did. The scientific articles of a new revelation redefined everything. A purpose. An identity. And in the silence between us that followed‚Äîwhere uncertainty once lived‚Äîhumanity found something else: unity.

World peace didn‚Äôt come from treaties. It came from the Earth and the Sky.

An encoded signal, buried in the fundamental particles of all matter. A repeating binary code of irrational numbers folded into every atom; crying out to anyone who could hear it‚Äîagain and again, and again‚Äîsince the Big Bang and into eternity. A message you could only see and hear if you knew¬†***how***¬†to look. When your planet, your species, were ready. Not a 'prime directive', but a simple test.

The discovery of the¬†**Architect Schematic**¬†and the graviton particle was only the beginning. Harnessing it into a Faster-Than-Light engine‚Äîthe¬†**Alcubierre Array**‚Äîsoon followed. Impulse Fold technology and the antiquation of fossil fuels. Artificial gravity. Unlimited clean energy. This was a gateway‚Äîfor any species capable of listening. A message from the cosmos written by a higher being in the universal language for all species‚Äîmathematics. A gift to the developed, the worthy. And the discovery of the¬†**Helion Commonwealth**‚Äîfor all species throughout the universe who were star born‚Äîand had the ability to listen and see what was sitting in plain sight all along.

Humanity didn‚Äôt invent gravity.

We just found out how to Fold it.

And the Universe came to us.

\---

Her likeness was captured like folded silk with precise detail into shining brass‚Äîone hand lifted mid-gesture, the other cradling a single piece of paper, frozen in the moment everything changed. Her gaze was cast upward, toward the stars she never lived to see.

The plaque at her feet read:

**‚ÄúFor the First who knew how to listen.¬†When the Universe spoke to us.‚Äù**

I used to pass it every day.

I never stopped. Not really. Not until now.

Because for me, the Academy never felt like it was built¬†*for*¬†me. I walked these paths like a ghost‚Äîhalf-seen, never quite welcome. First an outsider. Unworthy to be, even in the shadow of Voss. I wasn‚Äôt a cadet with clean boots and a father‚Äôs legacy on the honors list. I didn‚Äôt grow up in embassies or prep schools or a caring home. I came from nowhere. A destroyed childhood. A dead mother. A name I‚Äôd had to earn for myself, piece by piece.

I didn‚Äôt rise through the ranks of this Academy. I clawed my way up them‚Äîburied, bloodied, and breathless. And I got good at it. Real good.

But even now, with the stars in my reach, the voice inside still whispered the same thing:¬†*You don‚Äôt belong.*

And maybe that‚Äôs why I kept walking all those times. Not to admire the statues, not to honor the past‚ÄîBut to run from the part of me that still felt like I was trespassing on someone else‚Äôs future.

And still‚Äîthis morning, for the first time‚ÄîI let myself lift my head up high to her.

The moment I set up this sleek and portable countertop nugget ice maker in my kitchen, it was hard not to be impressed. It's compact, stylish, and surprisingly lightweight for an ice maker of its capacity. I‚Äôve admittedly been spoiled by how efficiently and quickly this little gadget churns out the coveted chewable ice everyone seems obsessed with these days. While I‚Äôve been more than satisfied overall, there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**A Stylish Fit for Any Countertop**

Its modern, minimalist design had me sold from the start. With dimensions of 11.3 x 8.66 x 12.68 inches and a weight of just 20.9 pounds, this machine doesn't scream for attention. It integrates seamlessly into my kitchen, and thanks to its neutral grey finish, it doesn‚Äôt stick out like a sore thumb. The built-in handle comes in handy when moving it between the kitchen counter and outdoor patio, which I did often during my recent BBQ party. This portability makes it ideal not just for home use but also for an RV, office, or even the break room at work.

**Rapid Ice Production**

It claims to produce ice in just 7 minutes, and from my testing, this claim holds up pretty well. I timed it repeatedly‚Äîyes, with a stopwatch‚Äîand it consistently delivered fresh nugget ice within the promised timeframe. Over the span of a day, it can churn out up to 35 lbs of pebble ice, more than enough to keep up with a family of avid iced coffee drinkers or cocktail enthusiasts during gatherings. While that‚Äôs impressive, the catch lies in the small basket‚Äîit can only hold 1.5 pounds of ice at a time. That‚Äôs fine for quick usage, but it means emptying the basket frequently if you‚Äôre hosting a crowd.

**Incredible Chewable Ice**

The texture of the ice is where this machine truly shines. Whether you‚Äôre sipping whiskey, enjoying a soda, or blending a smoothie, the AGLUCKY‚Äôs nugget ice is crunchy, soft, and melts slower compared to traditional ice cubes. This means it preserves the flavor of your beverages for much longer. My kids, who love munching on ice for some odd reason, couldn't get enough of it. Having a clear window on the machine that lets you watch the ice-making process is also a nice visual bonus. My friends‚Äîand their kids‚Äîfound this oddly satisfying during a recent party.

**Highlights**

- Produces up to 35 lbs of ice per day, perfect for families or small gatherings.  
- Smooth and chewable ice that melts slowly, preserving drink flavors.  
- Compact design with a handle for easy portability.  
- Quick, 7-minute operation, so ice is always on demand.  
- Energy-efficient with R600A refrigerant for eco-conscious buyers.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- Ice basket holds only 1.5 pounds, requiring frequent emptying during heavy usage.  
- The machine is slightly noisier than I'd hoped when it‚Äôs actively making ice.  
- Requires regular cleaning to prevent water spots or mineral buildup.  

**Self-Cleaning Function**

The self-cleaning feature is undoubtedly one of its best perks. All I had to do was fill the water tank and press the power button for five seconds, and the machine took care of the rest. I did this about every three days, as instructed, and it certainly made maintenance a breeze. Regular cleaning isn‚Äôt just for aesthetics‚Äîit genuinely extends the life of your machine, especially if you‚Äôre in an area with hard water. I‚Äôll admit I skipped cleaning a couple of times and noticed the ice wasn‚Äôt as clear afterward.

**Competing Brands**

Naturally, I had to see how it stacks up against competitors like GE Profile Nugget Ice Maker and Frigidaire EFIC235. While the GE Profile offers more capacity and quieter operation, it‚Äôs significantly more expensive‚Äîeasily costing nearly double. The Frigidaire counterpart closely matches AGLUCKY in terms of price, but I found its ice production slower and less consistent during trials. The AGLUCKY holds a sweet spot for those who want pebble ice without breaking the bank. However, if noise is a dealbreaker for you, GE Profile might be worth the investment.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Given its features and performance, this gadget offers excellent value for money. It checks most of the boxes for what a countertop ice maker should deliver‚Äîportability, ease of use, and consistent ice production. You could shell out more for pricier brands with added bells and whistles, but it‚Äôs hard to argue against the functionality this AGLUCKY model offers at its price point. It‚Äôs one of those kitchen gadgets you didn‚Äôt know you needed until you have it.

The barista takes my order and says, ""I see you're a creature of habit. What would you do if I switched your latte for a cappuccino?"" 

Still in my morning haze, I grinned and replied, ""Well, I guess I‚Äôd have to switch my morning grumble to a cheeky smile, wouldn‚Äôt I?""

He chuckled and said, ""Deal. Next time, it‚Äôs a cappuccino on the house if you promise me that smile.""

1k9wxos,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k9wxos/will_the_wirsh_cm5418_espresso_machine_satisfy/,Will the Wirsh CM5418 espresso machine satisfy coffee enthusiasts? A detailed review,"Using the wirsh CM5418 ""Home Barista"" espresso machine for the past few weeks has been a mix of excitement and discovery. The appeal of creating barista-quality espresso from my own kitchen sounded thrilling, and with plenty of coffee enthusiasts raving about this product, I had to give it a try. This compact yet versatile espresso maker promises a lot, especially for its price range, but does it deliver?

**Design and Build Quality**

This espresso machine certainly earned some style points the moment I unboxed it. Sleek, compact, and with a brushed stainless steel exterior, it feels more high-end than its price suggests. At just 12.2‚ÄùD x 5.5‚ÄùW x 11.9‚ÄùH, it fits snugly in my small kitchen without any hassle. The lightweight design made relocating it a breeze, although I did notice it occasionally shifted on the counter when applying extra force to fit the portafilter. The removable 42oz water tank is a thoughtful addition, ensuring easy refills without any spills.

**Features That Stand Out**

Every time I powered up the machine, the 20-bar original Italian pump and 1350W thermo-block heating system impressed me by reaching the ideal 9-bar pressure quickly. It pulls shots of espresso consistently and without delay after the brief preheating period. The included portafilter offers flexibility with its single and double shot options. Whether I want a quick espresso or a more indulgent latte, the machine caters well to my caffeine whims. 

The stainless-steel commercial-grade steam wand was especially fun to work with, though initially, my latte art looked disastrous. Once I got the hang of it, however, I was frothing milk like a pro. That wand is surprisingly efficient at both texturizing milk and heating it.

**Ease of Use**

Beginner-friendly is the best way to describe this machine. There are only three buttons‚Äîsingle, double, and steam‚Äîpaired with a dial for the frother. Even as someone not formally trained in espresso-making, I found it intuitive. Yet, for optimal results, I recommend spending some time learning about grind consistency, tamping pressure, and extraction timing. This may not be the kind of device to dump pre-ground coffee into and expect amazing results; preparation makes all the difference.

One small gripe I had was how tight the portafilter felt when new. It initially required some force and even a bit of wrestling to lock into place, though this loosened with frequent use. Another slight quirk was the lack of an adjustable temperature option‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt realized I cared for until having to time functions like switching between steaming and brewing.

**Highlighting The Perks**

- Compact and space-saving design.
- Impressive heating system that‚Äôs ready in seconds.
- Built-in steam wand for ultimate flexibility.
- BPA-free, ensuring a safer brewing experience.
- Supports single and double-shot espresso options.

**Critiques That Came Up**

- Portafilter was stiff at first and took getting used to.
- Lightweight build caused some movement during use.
- No water level indicator to signal refills.
- Temperature adjustments are unavailable.
- Steaming wand expels water before pure steam.

**Competing Products**

In today‚Äôs crowded espresso market, the wirsh CM5418 holds its ground well. I briefly compared it to other favorites like the Breville Bambino Plus and the De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica. While Breville offers higher flexibility in temperature options, its bigger price tag makes it less approachable for casual users. De‚ÄôLonghi‚Äôs design is suitable for compact spaces similar to the wirsh, but I personally felt the wirsh provided better milk frothing for lattes. Where wirsh slightly stumbles is its lightweight nature and absence of an auto-shutoff‚Äîa feature standard in many premium competitors.

**Bang for the Buck**

Considering the features packed into this small machine, its affordability stands out. There are espresso devices three times the price that deliver practically the same results, highlighting the wirsh CM5418 as an incredible bang-for-your-buck choice. Of course, investing in extras like a proper stainless steel tamper and possibly a burr grinder would enhance your experience further. If you want an entry-level espresso maker tailored to both beginners and intermediate coffee enthusiasts, this model is worth considering.

1k9wx7a,https://i.redd.it/ar6vo1116lxe1.png,Paying with Bitcoin in Warsaw,"As cryptocurrency continues to gain global acceptance, more travelers are discovering the convenience of using Bitcoin as a form of payment while abroad. Warsaw, the vibrant capital of Poland, is no exception. With a growing number of businesses, services, and financial platforms embracing Bitcoin, it's becoming easier than ever to spend your digital currency in this exciting city.

# Bitcoin-Friendly Businesses in Warsaw

Although Bitcoin is not yet universally accepted, Warsaw is seeing an increasing number of businesses that welcome it as a payment method. These businesses are often found in tech-savvy, creative areas like¬†**Praga**¬†and¬†**≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie**, where local entrepreneurs and establishments are more open to cryptocurrency payments.

Here‚Äôs a glimpse of where you can use Bitcoin in Warsaw:

* **Caf√©s and Restaurants**: Some independent caf√©s and eateries in trendy neighborhoods accept Bitcoin. Whether you‚Äôre grabbing a coffee or dining out, look for the Bitcoin symbol on the menu or payment counter to see if the business accepts it.
* **Accommodation**: Several boutique hotels, hostels, and guesthouses catering to a younger, tech-savvy crowd now accept Bitcoin for bookings and payments. It‚Äôs always a good idea to double-check with the accommodation beforehand, as not all hotels are crypto-friendly.
* **Tech and E-commerce Services**: Many local tech companies and online service providers, from freelance developers to marketing agencies, are happy to accept Bitcoin for their services. If you're visiting Warsaw for work, it's worth inquiring about crypto payments for professional services.
* **Shops and Online Stores**: A handful of local shops and online retailers now accept Bitcoin, especially those catering to niche markets or tech enthusiasts.

While Bitcoin adoption in Warsaw is still growing, these early adopters make it possible to integrate Bitcoin into your travel plans without having to worry too much about conversion to traditional currencies.

# Things to Consider

While Bitcoin is legal in Poland, it is treated as property for tax purposes, which means you may be subject to capital gains tax on your crypto transactions.

If you're unsure about the tax implications of using Bitcoin in Warsaw, it's always a good idea to consult with a local financial expert.

1k9wwet,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1k9wwet/you_call_that_a_stealth_mission/,You call that a Stealth Mission!,"Linnev had been staring at the same static telemetry grid for nearly four hours when the console finally beeped. Not the urgent warble of a fleet alert, nor the bored chirp of a routine update. This was the offbeat tone the system reserved for anomalous activity. The kind that usually meant sensor ghosts, pirate spam, or a derelict freighter leaking karaoke transmissions into open space.

She leaned forward. ‚ÄúBrannis,‚Äù she called across the cramped control cabin. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got something bouncing through Relay 9-Beta. Unencrypted. Localized in Esshar territory.‚Äù

Tech Officer Brannis, who had been in the middle of recalibrating a snack dispenser, let out a sigh. ‚ÄúAnother pirate mixtape?‚Äù

‚ÄúWorse,‚Äù Linnev muttered, turning up the gain. ‚ÄúHumans.‚Äù

That got his attention. He dropped the wrench and jogged over. Onscreen, a waveform blipped to life, crude, unshielded, and broadcasting wide-spectrum. As soon as Linnev tapped ‚Äòplayback,‚Äô they were greeted by the unmistakable sound of a human humming poorly the Mission: Impossible theme.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt be real,‚Äù Brannis whispered.

A voice crackled through the channel. Male, slightly raspy, enthusiastic in the way of someone with too much adrenaline and not enough supervision.

*‚ÄúShadow Unit Omega-Foxtrot-Kilo, Callsign: Snacktime, initiating Phase Sneaky-Sneaky. Jenkins, you‚Äôre up.‚Äù*

There was a pause. A metallic clatter. Someone swore in the background.

*‚ÄúSensor grid's‚Ä¶ kind of active. Hold on. I think this is the right wire. If it sparks, that means it‚Äôs working, right?‚Äù*

There was a spark. Then a very human yelp.

*‚ÄúGood hustle, Jenkins. Classic misdirection-by-electrocution. Mark it down as intentional.‚Äù*

Linnev blinked. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre narrating their own infiltration mission.‚Äù

Brannis was already opening a line to Commander Feskal.

By the time Feskal stormed in, shoulder pads crooked, still fastening his uniform collar, the humans had progressed to what appeared to be a hallway traversal segment, complete with whispered footstep sounds and what Linnev could only assume was someone dragging a broom along the floor for ambiance.

‚ÄúWhat in the Frozen Spiral am I listening to?‚Äù Feskal growled.

‚ÄúUnsecured human signal,‚Äù Linnev said calmly. ‚ÄúLive commentary from an infiltration op. Probably parody. They‚Äôre calling themselves ‚ÄòShadow Unit Omega-Foxtrot-Kilo.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúCallsign ‚ÄòSnacktime,‚Äô‚Äù Brannis added, as if this detail somehow helped.

Feskal stared at the screen. At that moment, a new voice chimed in. Female, dry, impatient.

*‚ÄúWhy are we carrying actual boxes?‚Äù

‚ÄúImmersion,‚Äù the first voice replied. ‚ÄúThis is what tactical commitment looks like.‚Äù

Then came footsteps, a hiss, and a hurried whisper.

‚ÄúEnemy patrol at twelve o'clock.‚Äù*

There was a sudden burst of accordion music.

*‚ÄúOkay. Time for Protocol Wedding Party Alpha.‚Äù*

A voice began to sing terribly in what Linnev recognized as badly pronounced Esshar dialect. The lyrics involved love, recycled oxygen, and a promise of eternal togetherness. The background comms flickered, revealing the confused mutterings of an enemy squad withdrawing.

Feskal sat down slowly. ‚ÄúThat just worked.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it gets better,‚Äù Brannis said. ‚ÄúRewinding five minutes. Listen to this part.‚Äù

Another segment played. The humans were trying to access a secured server room.

*‚ÄúWe knock and say we‚Äôre here to clean the vents?‚Äù

‚ÄúI brought thermite. I also brought donuts. Both have proven effective.‚Äù*

There was an explosion. Then the sound of someone humming a triumphant orchestral fanfare.

Feskal‚Äôs mandibles twitched. ‚ÄúThey think this is‚Ä¶ stealth.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey think this is how you do stealth,‚Äù Linnev said, not without admiration.

For a moment, all three of them listened in silence. The humans were casually discussing extraction options. Jenkins was arguing about whether ‚ÄúPhase Skedaddle‚Äù should include rappelling or just running really fast.

Feskal stood up again, rubbing his face. ‚ÄúForward the feed to Fleet Intelligence. Priority‚Ä¶ medium. No, make it high. Just in case.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn case of what?‚Äù Brannis asked.

‚ÄúIn case these idiots actually pull it off.‚Äù

Ten minutes later, the human voices crackled again.

*‚ÄúShadow Unit Omega-Foxtrot-Kilo, Callsign Snacktime, exfiltrating via sewer maintenance tunnel. Debrief at base. Jenkins only set two fires this time.

Also, someone bring beer.‚Äù*

The transmission cut.

No alarm bells rang from the Esshar side. No ships were scrambled. No intercept protocols initiated. The entire enemy force had apparently heard the whole thing and dismissed it as absurdist theater.

Feskal crossed his arms and stared at the now-empty signal screen.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to redefine ‚Äòstealth,‚Äô aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù

Brannis nodded. ‚ÄúOr outlaw humans again.‚Äù

Linnev just sat back in her chair, replaying the transmission for the fourth time. ‚ÄúSnacktime,‚Äù she said, shaking her head. ‚ÄúStars help us. They even branded themselves.‚Äù

---

The transport to Fleet Command was silent, save for the hum of the stabilizers and the occasional involuntary sigh from Brannis. Linnev hadn‚Äôt spoken since they‚Äôd left Listening Post 3-Zeta. The moment they had forwarded the Snacktime transmission up the chain, everything had gone sideways. Someone in Central had listened to five minutes of the audio, flagged it for ‚Äúpossible security incident,‚Äù and ordered an immediate personnel recall.

Now they were en route to Sector Command HQ, being treated like they‚Äôd discovered an enemy superweapon instead of what Linnev still insisted was a group of humans narrating their own idiocy live.

Fleet Command Headquarters loomed into view. The structure was brutalist and symmetrical, like someone had weaponized a filing cabinet and called it architecture. Once docked, they were escorted to Briefing Room C-7, a space designed to make even admirals feel small. It smelled faintly of burned synth-coffee and panic.

Inside, three ranking officers waited. Commander Feskal was there, already seated, his mandibles twitching like they always did when he had been awake too long. Beside him sat Admiral Teyven, whose ceremonial armor bore more medals than practical plating, and across from them was Intelligence Director Seltri, who looked like she hadn‚Äôt blinked in several minutes.

The room‚Äôs primary display lit up. Someone had already queued the human transmission. The playback began, and for the next fifty-six minutes, no one spoke. Linnev watched as the expressions on the senior officers shifted gradually from amusement, to confusion, to deep, troubled silence.

When the broadcast ended, the room remained quiet for a long moment.

Then Admiral Teyven spoke.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he said slowly, ‚Äúlet me summarize. A team of humans infiltrated an Esshar intelligence facility, recovered forty-two terabytes of data, destroyed two minor infrastructure nodes, and exited the system undetected.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù Brannis said. He looked like he wanted to disappear into his uniform.

‚ÄúAnd they did this while broadcasting the entire operation over open comms. Using no encryption. With running commentary. With theme music.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù Linnev said. ‚ÄúThey hummed most of it themselves.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey posed as a wedding party,‚Äù Feskal added quietly.

Director Seltri turned to the center of the table, where a data pad was already displaying the transcript of the transmission. She tapped it once.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve traced the voices to a recognized auxiliary human recon unit. Shadow Unit Omega-Foxtrot-Kilo. Their official designation was decommissioned two cycles ago. Technically, they no longer exist. Which may explain why no one was monitoring their current activity.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey are listed under informal callsign ‚ÄòSnacktime,‚Äô‚Äù she added.

‚ÄúOf course they are,‚Äù Teyven muttered.

Feskal leaned forward. ‚ÄúCan I just point out that everything they did should have failed? Every standard doctrine says noise is detection. Commentary is compromise. Pretending to be caterers at a military installation is not in any of our infiltration training.‚Äù

Seltri ignored him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve initiated post-mission interviews with the human personnel involved. I‚Äôve reviewed the preliminary transcripts.‚Äù

She activated a side screen. A human male appeared, mid-thirties, dark hair, cheerful demeanor. His uniform was rumpled and he was clearly speaking from a mess hall. He waved at the camera like it was a family holocall.

‚ÄúOh, yeah, the op went great,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMorale was high. Jenkins only dropped the blowtorch once.‚Äù

Someone off-camera asked him if he believed the mission had been stealthy.

‚ÄúAbsolutely,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúStealth is a mindset. Confidence is camouflage. We moved with such purpose no one would ever doubt we belonged there.‚Äù

Seltri tapped the pad again, skipping ahead. Another human appeared, this one younger, with a tactical headset slung around his neck.

‚ÄúYou were broadcasting live,‚Äù the interviewer said.

‚ÄúWell, yeah,‚Äù the human replied. ‚ÄúWe were doing unit branding. You know, building the Snacktime following.‚Äù

Linnev blinked. ‚ÄúThey have fans?‚Äù

‚ÄúApparently several thousand,‚Äù Seltri said. ‚ÄúMostly on human entertainment platforms. Their operation was livestreamed to an encrypted fan page that our systems still cannot access due to‚Ä¶ formatting incompatibility.‚Äù

Teyven exhaled and stood. ‚ÄúThis is idiotic.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù Seltri agreed. ‚ÄúBut it worked.‚Äù

Feskal looked around the room. ‚ÄúSo what do we do with this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat,‚Äù Teyven said, ‚Äúis the problem. If we reprimand them, we look ungrateful. If we promote them, we encourage this.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey succeeded,‚Äù Seltri said. ‚ÄúClean op. No casualties. Mission objectives exceeded. Enemy unaware.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey also sang a cover of an Esshar drinking song while planting explosives,‚Äù Feskal said.

‚ÄúI am aware,‚Äù Seltri replied. ‚ÄúIt was oddly catchy.‚Äù

Brannis finally spoke. ‚ÄúWhat about the Esshar? Why didn‚Äôt they respond?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey released a security advisory yesterday,‚Äù Seltri said. ‚ÄúThey assumed the broadcast was a psychological operation designed to mock them. They have not connected it to the facility breach.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo the humans were so obvious,‚Äù Linnev said slowly, ‚Äúthat the enemy decided they couldn‚Äôt possibly be real.‚Äù

‚ÄúPrecisely,‚Äù Seltri said.

Teyven returned to his seat. ‚ÄúFine. Final recommendation?‚Äù

Seltri consulted her tablet.

‚ÄúOperationally effective. Strategically indecipherable.‚Äù

Teyven stared at her. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a report category?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is now.‚Äù

As the meeting adjourned, Linnev and Brannis filed out behind the senior officers. Feskal stopped them at the door.

‚ÄúNext time you pick up something that sounds like it came from a low-budget comedy broadcast,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúflag it sooner.‚Äù

Linnev nodded. ‚ÄúSir. But to be fair, it did start with someone humming music into a microphone.‚Äù

Feskal grunted and walked away.

Outside the meeting room, Brannis pulled out his data tablet.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútheir channel‚Äôs public now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not subscribing to Snacktime,‚Äù Linnev said without looking.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying. Might be useful. For‚Ä¶ research.‚Äù

Linnev sighed. ‚ÄúStars help us all.‚Äù

And somewhere in deep space, another unencrypted signal flickered to life.

‚ÄúWelcome back, friends and followers. Shadow Unit Snacktime here. Phase Naptime has been canceled. We are now moving into Phase Ultra-Sneak. Jenkins, cue the mood music.‚Äù

Linnev didn‚Äôt hear it, of course.

I met a girl who, after some time talking, told me she had autism. Our conversations were often one-sided, with me trying to keep them going. We planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she had injured her leg.

She told me I was treating her differently after she shared that she had autism. She also revealed that her ex had abandoned her and that she had recently been seeing someone who replaced her. One day, after I was mugged and almost lost her contact, I found it odd that she didn't seem to care much about what happened and was indifferent, saying she wouldn‚Äôt message me if I didn‚Äôt message her first.

She got upset when her cousin mentioned that she used to drink with her ex. Later, I invited her to the movies because she often said we never went out. At first, she said she wouldn‚Äôt go because she was embarrassed, but after I insisted, she agreed. However, the next day, she suggested, ‚ÄúWouldn't it be better if we were just friends?‚Äù

We ended up going to the movies. We met there, bought candy, kissed during the film, and spent the afternoon together, acting like a couple. I noticed she was very reserved ‚Äî she wouldn‚Äôt let me see her phone and refused to give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

We went to the mall once, and she gave me chocolate. Later, we went to the park again, spent time together, and when she was about to go home, I insisted on walking her back. It became clear that she didn‚Äôt want me to meet her family. I dropped her off and left.

Her sister came to drop her off at my place, and I ended up saying, in front of them, that we didn‚Äôt go out because she was ‚Äúbeing difficult.‚Äù She got really mad. Later, we played a game together, but when I criticized it, she got upset and stopped playing. Despite this, she brought me chocolate another day. We spent some time together, but then she started talking about breaking up.

She invited me to a party, but became unsure whether she would even go. I asked if she wanted me to go, and she gave vague answers. I decided to go anyway and asked if I could arrive earlier, but she made it clear she wanted me to arrive at 6 PM. I ended up getting there earlier, and her sister saw me on the street and called me up. We then went to a friend‚Äôs party, where she introduced me as her boyfriend. Suddenly, she said, ‚ÄúShould we download an app to find you a hot girl?‚Äù

Afterward, we went back to her house, and she wanted me to stay the night, but I ended up going home. With all these things piling up, I decided to call her and end things. She cried and blocked me, later saying that I had ""sent her to CAPS"" (mental health services) and ‚Äútaken away her happiness.‚Äù A few days later, she messaged me, saying she missed me more than she thought she would.

We started talking again, but while chatting, I found her on a dating app. I confronted her, and she claimed she was looking for a friend's ex. In the end, I told her I loved her, and she replied that it would ""pass"" and said she went to a place where she wished I had been with her.

Later, she called me and invited me to her mother‚Äôs birthday party, but I didn‚Äôt go. Her mother even called me asking if I loved her and invited me to coffee. We resumed talking, but she later told me her father was furious with me. I felt bad and vented online, and she saw it. She got really angry, accused me of deceiving and using her, said her insecurities were tied to her autism, and that she prayed for me every day ‚Äî and then she blocked me and disappeared from my life.

I‚Äôm a 3rd-year finance co-op student from Toronto, and I can‚Äôt find an internship.

I failed to get my first summer internship during my first year, and I ended up spending 4 months doing nothing but going back to school.

I got a summer internship in my 2nd year, but when I asked to return this summer, it was a no. Since the department is not participating in the trainee program. It‚Äôs not their fault, but I think they‚Äôre downsizing.

For my 3rd year of university, I was assigned to a co-op placement for winter 2025 (Jan-April). Despite trying to find one, I failed. Since September 2024 I've been applying for Summer 2025 internship, and yet nothing. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

I've been going to a bunch of networking events, countless coffee chats, cold emails etc. I did get referred for a summer 2026 internship but never heard back from recruiter. 

I have only gotten one interview since January, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I have a solid resume and everything. The problem is I can‚Äôt get an interview.

Like, yeah, there were some pre-interviews I had with the recruiter. They said it's up to the hiring manager to select who they want to interview. Never got a call back.

What even sucks is that I tried connecting with a bunch of people whose roles I want to do in the future. But they‚Äôre not accepting my LinkedIn invitation. Some people I already connected with don‚Äôt even look at their LinkedIn message. 

I have a great LinkedIn profile. My coffee chats and interview skills aren‚Äôt great. But tbh, I don't know what to do.

I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm not going to get an internship for summer 2026. More importantly idk what to do this summer. 

I‚Äôm just so pissed at recruiters and alumni not responding to my messages or emails. 

All of them are perfectly tailored to them and they don‚Äôt want to give back. Like if I was working in my dream job and a student reached out to me. I don‚Äôt mind helping them out.

Chapter 5: A Wistful Memory 



Around that same day, somewhere in the wealthy residential areas in Hollywood Hills. At a large mansion that was being guarded regularly by multiple wolf keidran personnel walking around armed with their assault rifles and sub-machine guns. 



Sen. Clovis is seen in his personal office, sitting on his chair with his legs resting over the desk while speaking to someone on the phone. Standing beside him is his trusted bodyguard Brutus who looked so happy and cheerful whenever he's around with his boss.



Clovis hasn't been acting like his usual self since the previous day when he saw the news report after the event took place. One of the witnesses who spoke out in the news interview had mentioned a short-haired female wolf keidran only identified as 'Natani', who were among the four brave bystanders that fought back against the perpetrators. Clovis was beyond frustrated upon discovering that his former gun-for-hire is still alive and currently on the run after she and her brother escaped his mansion a year ago during a gunfight with one of his henchmen. 



""Look here, Captain Roan. I need you to do me a favor, send your whole crew to search the entire city this instant! No one is allowed to slack off until those traitorous scums have been tracked down. Do I make myself clear?""



His captain replied loud and clear, ""Don't worry much about it, Boss. Everything has been prepped up and is set for the job."" 



""Good. Don't call me back until one of your guys have manage to capture those bastards. Now, adios."" 



After hanging up the phone, Clovis let out a long sigh upon feeling stressed out. He decided to open up a bottle of bourbon on his desk and poured it into his glass. Shortly after taking a shot of his bourbon, he turned to his right and looked up where he saw Brutus staring at him with a big smile on his face. There was a long silence around them for a little while. 



Knowing that Brutus is his closest friend and a trusted bodyguard, who is often loyal to him, Clovis thought of pouring him a bottle of his bourbon into another glass.



""Bourbon?""



""Don't mind If I do, Boss!"" 



As Clovis went to offer him a glass of bourbon, Brutus carefully took it with his hand and proceeds taking a shot of the drink. Clovis smiled at him upon seeing the wolf bodyguard being all happy and cheerful around him. 



""Say, what's gotten you all worked up lately, Boss?"" Brutus asked. 



Clovis responded to him, ""It's that short-haired, cocksucking, double-crossing bitch Natani. I just found out from the news that she's still alive somewhere in the city along with her brother Zen."" He added shortly after taking a drink, ""I figured this would be a perfect opportunity to order my men and have them find those two for disappointing me on that botched assassination.""



""Ooohh, I remember her! She's just as tough as nails!"" Brutus recalled. 



He chuckled, ""Once I finally have the bitch and her brother tied up and gagged here in my office, I'll personally send them my regards before they'll get to sleep peacefully with the fishes.""



After taking another shot of bourbon, Clovis looked at Brutus with a smirk on his face, shortly before letting out a sinister cackle. He ensures that one of his henchmen will be able to track down Natani and Zen sooner or later. 



\[March 6, 1993\]



Four days after the incident took place. It was a beautiful Saturday morning at Trace's apartment. Both Trace and Flora were seen having their breakfast at the kitchen area. Trace took his coffee before he proceeds to eat up the pancakes that Flora had made earlier. Flora on the other hand seems to enjoy solving a crossword puzzle on a newspaper that Trace handed to her earlier. 



""So, Trace? How are the pancakes I made?"" Flora asked. ""I made them specially just for you!""



""Wow, I never imagined they turned out quite this good."" Trace responded. ""I'd usually burn them in the process. I'm not much of a good cook.""



""Awww, I'm glad you liked 'em!"" 



As Trace ate thoroughly for a while, Flora has just remembered asking him about the young woman named Saria a few days ago. As she felt curious, she decided to break the silence, and asked Trace to know more about her. 



""So, about that girl in that photo, could you tell me more about her?""



Trace stopped eating once Flora asked him. He looked at her for a brief moment, taking a long pause. Shortly afterwards, he began to spill out the truth that he has been keeping as a secret since the day Flora curiously asked him about it. 



""The girl on the photo you're asking me about is my late wife - Saria.."" He answered. 



She replied, expressing sadness. ""Oh my, I-I.. I'm sorry for your loss, Trace... Is it okay for you to tell me whatever happened to her?"" 



""Saria was my beloved wife, Flora.."" He continued as he tried to explain, ""She and I used to live happily like every other couple. Until that fateful night.."" Trace added as tears slowly dripped down his face, ""She was sadly murdered on that fateful night. I was there walking along with her after watching a movie. We were heading back to the car at the parking lot when this wolf keidran showed up to rob us at gunpoint. I tried to fight back and protect her from that wolf, but it did not end well... Saria ended up being shot fatally, and I was shortly knocked unconscious with his gun..""



Flora watched as he was about to cry. She heavily felt Trace's sadness and grief from the tragic loss of his wife. Devastated and heartbroken as Trace felt upon mentioning the fateful event, he soon began to cry abruptly as he deeply misses Saria to this very day. 



""Oh.. Trace... I-I'm so sorry.. Are you okay..? Do you need company?"" Flora asked, worried about him. 



He replied back, wiping off his tears. ""I'm fine, Flora. It's just.. I could've wished I did everything to protect her against that monster..!""



Feeling concerned, Flora stood up and walked closer to Trace. She leaned in to give him a comfortable hug, hoping that he'll soon stop crying. Trace managed to held back his tears, then wrapped his arms around her in response to her support. They hugged each other for a while, which gave Trace enough time to calm himself down. 



""I'm terribly sorry to hear about what happened to her, Trace.. Would you like a glass of water?""  



Trace answered and nodded, ""Sure thing.."" 



After quite a while, Flora went to grab him a glass of water by the kitchen sink. Once she fills up the glass with water, she then walked back to him.



""Here you go, I hope you'll feel better soon.""



Trace picked up the glass of water as he proceeds to drink it entirely until the last drop.



""Thank you very kindly, Flora.."" Trace said, putting the empty glass aside over the table.



""Anything for my lovely Trace."" Said Flora, she added and asked, ""Hey - since today's Saturday, what are you up to this weekend?""



He responded, ""Usually, I'd do a little cleaning around my apartment, then go out to pay off some bills. I also have an appointment from my therapist that I must attend today by afternoon.""



""Oh, okay."" Flora said. ""So what's your therapist like if I'm wondering?"" She asked. 



""Her name is Dr. Nora, and I'd describe her as professional and compassionate,"" Trace added, ""She's my therapist who operates a clinic not far away from here.""



""That's quite interesting.. How long have you been seeing her?"" She asked.



Trace answered, ""I've been attending her therapy sessions for the last couple of  years. Ever since then, I'd always thanked her for offering me some of her important advices on how to cope with grief and loss, then find better ways to move on and leave the past behind.""



""Oh, Trace.."" Flora began wrapping her arms around him as she felt emotional. ""I'm just glad that you were able to find someone who can help.."" 



""I know.. Thank you for standing by my side, Flora.."" Said Trace while hugging her gently.

1k9wth0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k9wth0/aita_for_ending_things_with_her_after_she_accused/,AITA for Ending Things With Her After She Accused Me of Using Her and Made Me Question My Sanity?I'm thinking about giving up on life,"
I met a girl who, after some time talking, told me she had autism. Our conversations were mostly one-sided ‚Äî I would talk, but often felt like I was the only one trying to keep the conversation going. We had planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she had injured her leg.

She said that I was treating her differently after she told me about her autism. She also revealed that her ex had abandoned her and that recently she had been seeing a guy who ended up replacing her. One day, after I was mugged and almost lost her contact, I found it strange that she didn't seem to care much and acted quite indifferent, saying she wouldn‚Äôt message me if I didn't message her first.

There was an incident where she got really upset when her cousin mentioned that she used to drink with her ex. After some time, I invited her to go to the movies because she often said we never went out. At first, she said she wouldn't go because she was embarrassed, but after I insisted, she agreed. However, the next day she suggested, ""Wouldn't it be better if we were just friends?""

Even so, we went to the movies. We met there, bought some candy, kissed during the film, and spent the afternoon acting like a couple. I noticed she was very reserved ‚Äî she wouldn‚Äôt let me see her phone and refused to give me her Instagram, only sharing it after we broke up.

On another occasion, we went to the mall, and she gave me a chocolate. Later, we went back to the park, spent some romantic time together, and when she was about to go home, I insisted on walking her back. It was clear she didn't want me to meet her family. I dropped her off and left.

In another episode, her sister came to drop her off at my place, and I ended up saying, in front of them, that we didn‚Äôt go out because she was ‚Äúbeing difficult.‚Äù She got very mad at me. Later, we played a game together, but when I criticized the game, she got upset and stopped playing. Still, she brought me chocolate another day. We spent some time together, but soon after, she started talking about breaking up.

She invited me to a party with her but then became unsure if she would even go. I asked if she really wanted me to come, and her answer was vague. I decided to go anyway and asked if I could arrive earlier, but she made it clear she wanted me to show up only at 6 PM. I ended up arriving a bit earlier, and her sister saw me on the street and called me up. Later, we went to a friend‚Äôs party, where she introduced me as her boyfriend. Out of nowhere, she joked, ‚ÄúShould we download an app to find you a hot girl?‚Äù

After that, we went back to her house. She wanted me to stay the night, but I ended up going home. With all these issues piling up, I decided to call her and end things. She cried and blocked me, later saying that I had ""sent her to CAPS"" (mental health services) and ""took away her happiness."" A few days later, she messaged me, saying she missed me more than she thought she would.

We started talking again, but while we were chatting, I found her on a dating app. I confronted her, and she claimed she was searching for a friend's ex. In the end, I confessed that I loved her, and she replied that it would ‚Äúpass‚Äù and told me she had gone somewhere wishing I had been there.

Later, she called me, inviting me to her mother's birthday party, but I didn‚Äôt go. Her mother even called me asking if I loved her and invited me over for coffee. We resumed talking, but she later told me her father was furious with me. Feeling bad, I vented online, and she found out. She got very angry, accused me of using and deceiving her, said that her insecurities were tied to her autism, that she had prayed for me every day ‚Äî and finally, she blocked me and disappeared from my life.

The project has changed the lives of many thousands of community members.

A Kendu (can-do) attitude has made countless people get up off the couch, out of retirement, and out on the streets building under the brand umbrella.

The Kendu community has built:

\- A Kendu Games Studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs  
\- Kendu beers  
\- A Kendu board game  
\- Kendu energy drinks  
\- Kendu events company in India  
\- Kendu events presence USA  
\- Kendu sports brand (You Kendu It)  
\- Kendu eSports team  
\- Kendu coffee brand  
\- Kendu sweets, chocolates, and spirits  
\- Much more in the works

Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Imagine a permissionless brand behemoth that anyone can build under, immediately tapping into a scaling CaaS (Community-as-a-service), where the treasury is voluntarily, not contractually, is replenished by those building businesses under Kendu, and that treasury is transparently used for grants for products, businesses, or initiatives the community wants to build with Kendu. Almost akin to an L1.

And of course kendu is still a memecoin so everything relates back to the Kendu dog on the coin for those wondering. I believe Kendu will become the industry standard, forcing future coins to start innovating rather than trying the same structure of the typical coin we see today: create some bland narrative, start getting KOLs to call it (mad apes, pow etc... people who only want supply) and then proceed to run the coin for a week before leaving it.

You can Kendufy anything. And everything will be Kendufied.

1k9wnmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k9wnmr/investigate_if_the_wirsh_home_barista_espresso/,Investigate if the Wirsh Home Barista Espresso Machine delivers premium coffee quality review,"Testing out the Wirsh CM5418, I dove straight into the world of homemade espresso. I‚Äôll admit it, I was skeptical at first. Can a machine with such a compact profile and straightforward design really pull off caf√©-quality espresso drinks? But after a few weeks of brewing, I must say, it‚Äôs been a surprisingly rewarding experience. I‚Äôve used dozens of coffee machines over the years, but this one managed to both impress and reveal areas it could improve. Let‚Äôs dissect my experience.

**DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY**  
The Wirsh CM5418 is a sleek piece of equipment. Its brushed stainless-steel body is not just visually appealing but also lends a durable and sturdy feel. Measuring 12.2 inches deep, 5.5 inches wide, and 11.9 inches high, it saves a ton of counter space‚Äîperfect for those of us with kitchens already packed with a blender, toaster, and countless spice jars. The machine's lightweight nature makes it easy to move around, though this can be a double-edged sword; I noticed it slid a bit while locking the portafilter in place. It‚Äôs nothing a rubber mat couldn‚Äôt solve, but worth keeping in mind. I also appreciated the LED indicator lights; they‚Äôre bright and unambiguous, reducing any guesswork about machine functions.

**BREW PERFORMANCE AND STEAMING WAND**  
Armed with a 20-bar Italian pump and 1350W thermo-block heating system, I initially doubted whether it could deliver consistent espresso results. All doubts faded after brewing my first few shots. The crema was rich, the espresso was aromatic, and, paired with fresh beans and a decent burr grinder, the flavor was on point. My mornings have probably never been this caffeinated, to be honest.  

The built-in steam wand, constructed from stainless steel, surprised me. Frothing milk for cappuccinos or creating silky microfoam for lattes was a breeze. It wasn‚Äôt overly complicated, which is a blessing if you‚Äôre not a barista-level steam artist. Cleaning the wand was equally easy, which made it less daunting to whip up a few extra drinks for my partner or guests.

[**Discover Wirsh CM5418 deals on Amazon now.**](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08x627458/)

**EASE OF USE**  
This espresso machine is delightfully simple. It doesn‚Äôt bombard its user with unnecessary bells and whistles. Equipped with just three buttons (single shot, double shot, and steam), and a basic dial for controlling the steam wand, the setup is intuitive even for newcomers to espresso making. One small hiccup I noticed was the tight fit of the portafilter when the machine was brand new; it required a little extra force to secure. Thankfully, it loosened up with repeated use. My advice? Don‚Äôt be discouraged during your first attempt.

**POSITIVES**  
- Compact, stylish design fits tight kitchen spaces.  
- Delivers excellent espresso results with rich crema.  
- Easy-to-use steaming wand for milk frothing and microfoam.  
- Bright, user-friendly LED indicators simplify operations.  

**FLAWS**  
- Lightweight design makes it prone to sliding during portafilter insertion.  
- No adjustable water temperature control.  
- Steam wand emits excess water before starting, requiring a quick purge.  
- Lacks an alert system for low water levels in the reservoir.

**ADDITIONAL FEATURES**  
The 42-ounce removable water tank is a fantastic addition‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to refill and offers enough capacity to brew multiple shots between fill-ups. The portafilter‚Äôs two-in-one design with single and double filters is another highlight. With the press of a button, I could brew either single or double shots depending on my caffeine demands for the day. However, users should note that this isn‚Äôt a programmable machine‚Äîtemperature and pressure settings are fixed, which will occasionally leave perfectionists longing for more control.

**MARKET RIVALS**  
Exploring competitors such as the Breville Bambino Plus and the De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica, it‚Äôs clear where the Wirsh CM5418 holds its ground. Its affordability and compact size make it an appealing alternative. The Bambino boasts faster heat-up times and temperature adjustability but comes at a steeper price. Meanwhile, the Dedica rivals the Wirsh in space-saving design, though it has a slightly weaker steam wand. If you‚Äôre shopping on a budget or just starting in the home espresso world, this machine strikes the right balance without frustrating compromises.

**QUALITY FOR PRICE**  
When it comes to delivering a quality espresso experience without excessively draining your wallet, the Wirsh CM5418 truly excels. Machines in a similar price range often fall short on build quality or brewing performance, but this espresso maker punches above its weight. While it doesn‚Äôt boast the advanced features of pricier machines, its straightforward design and reliability make it a strong contender for coffee enthusiasts on a budget.

1k9wnfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/1k9wnfx/how_to_help_a_small_mourning_flock/,How to help a (small) mourning flock,"I have a small free range backyard flock of four Rhode Island Red hens that I raised from chicks. We live on acreage in the woods and the wildlife activity has picked up with the warmer weather. 

Yesterday, while I was away from the house and while my family was occupied, we believe it was a hawk that finally got to one of our hens. In the past, we had successfully chased them away and our dogs have managed to scare them away, but the hawk was clever and got to one of our darling hens. The remaining three are obviously shaken and are mourning. They‚Äôre very quiet and haven‚Äôt eaten as much as they usually do, they‚Äôre missing their sister and I hear them call out to her. 

My family and I are giving them extra attention and their favorite treats, and I know it will take time for them to work through the shock and trauma of watching their sister be attacked and killed, but what would you suggest I do to make them feel safer? I‚Äôve left my kitchen door open so they can come in and out of the house (as they love to do), and I‚Äôve left our dogs (one is a LGD) outside to help monitor the foxes and hawks, and to hopefully make them feel safe-ish. We have also spent more time with them, sitting outside for our morning coffee and talking to them. Any experience with this kind of loss in a smaller flock that you can share with me?

(26F, sapphic)","Going all the way to Melrose for Boycott or Stacy's doesn't really feel like the move, it's too far away and at this point I have too many exes that go to both. Brick Road Coffee in tempe is nice if not unfortunately for the same ex issue.

I've been to Level One on Main and having a gamer bar nearby is nice, but I prefer hanging out with other people in their mid/late 20s/30s/40s. LO tends to have wayy too many college students and I don't really feel comfy around people who aren't over 25. I'm also sober, so a coffeeshop would be better. Chill tabletop games with other LGBTQIA+ older ppl would be actual paradise. Thank u for the help sry for being picky lol

edit: if it helps, i am annoyingly obsessed with ancient sitcoms and every Fallout game",0,1745849816.0,mesaaz,10,0.5,False

1k9wlsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1k9wlsz/my_colonoscopy_experience_us28f/,my colonoscopy experience! (US/28/f),"hi gang! reading everyone‚Äôs stories really helped me feel less nervous for the procedure, so i thought i‚Äôd share mine! bit of background: i‚Äôve had intermittent bright red blood on the TP on and off for awhile (honestly probably since 2021, but i really only started paying attention in 2022 when i realized it wasn‚Äôt normal). i knew i had a residual hemorrhoidal skin tag, and my GP figured the bleeding was just hemorrhoids. i started to notice narrowing in my stools at the end of 2024, so that combined with the blood and the fact that i‚Äôm brca1+ made my GP refer me to a GI, who recommended a colonoscopy. and here we are. 

monday: 7 days before procedure day. i started a low fiber diet. this felt kind of excessive but worked out well. i‚Äôm vegetarian so this was a weird week of eating for me. ate a lot of pasta, canned fruit, applesauce, cooked mushrooms, eggs, etc. 

sunday: prep day (boo). had a liquid diet all day. made some really gross jello with apple juice and agar agar. had a few sips of bouillon broth but mostly sat around in despair. i used suprep and took the first dose at 4pm. first sip was okay and it got progressively worse from there. i can‚Äôt believe they haven‚Äôt figured out a less disgusting way to do this. mixed it with chilled water, sipped it with a straw while plugging my nose, chased each gulp with a sip of apple juice. TMI but first BM was actually completely normal. the floodgates opened a little under an hour after i started drinking the prep. i hung out in the bathroom with my water bottle and criminal minds; it took about 45 minutes for my output to be basically clear, and another 15 minutes for me to feel comfortable leaving the bathroom. my husband had set up our heated blanket for me which i HIGHLY recommend once you‚Äôre in a place to leave the bathroom. i also think the longer term low fiber diet helped the process be so speedy. had a couple more bathroom trips but by the time i went to bed i was all clear. 

monday (procedure day): woke up at 2:30 am to take prep at 3:00 am for my 9:00 am procedure. the second dose was somehow worse and i was really worried i was going to throw it up. thankfully i did not and that process started pretty much as soon as i was done drinking, 30 minutes after starting. was in the bathroom maybe an hour ish, then came back out and slept a bit more before going to the hospital. actual procedure was really fast; i was called back around 7:50 and when i woke up they told me it was 8:37. my husband said i was only under anesthesia for 7 minutes. they said they found hemorrhoids (shock) and a 2mm polyp that they suspect is benign but i should know for sure later this week on the off chance it‚Äôs precancerous. just got home, had some coffee and a snack and my husband is out getting us a meal because all i want is taco bell. 

good luck anyone going through this!! the prep sucks but is totally manageable. the worst part for me was not being able to eat solids.",5,1745849727.0,colonoscopy,0,0.86,False
