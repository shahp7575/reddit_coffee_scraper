This will sound made, but please at least give it a go. An ice lolly. 

I dunno what it is, I think maybe it's the coldness affecting the part of the brain that's misreading whatever signals the RLS are, but it takes the sensation away almost immediately. Sadly it only lasts as long as the ice lolly but when you've had it for over an hour those few minutes respite are precious.

I've also had some real success with cutting out caffeine in the past few months. I had seen a neurologist through the NHS years and years ago who advised it but I dismissed it as I don't drink tea coffee etc. Went private in November last year and was advised the same but this time they mentioned fizzy drinks (my only vice) as a large source of caffeine. So I switched my irn-bru to irn-bru 1901 and started drinking only fanta, vimto, sprite etc.

I take Tramadol before bed to get a sleep, and like other people have said about other medications, it's very hit and miss.

I don't place orders here super often, but I was studying for my midterm before class and trying to save myself some time. 

I was so looking forward to my ""treat"" coffee, and so it was the first thing I looked for once my order was delivered. As soon as I picked it up, I noticed there was coffee dripping down the side. I unscrewed the cap, and it was completely missing the foil seal. I'm sure since it was early in the morning, my shopper opened and sipped it. 

I drove to Target in my pj's, found the same product, and sure enough- they all had the foil seal. 

I got a refund for the item, and asked not to get that shopper again. But I'm still so unsettled by this experience. I used to shop for instacart myself, and I'm well aware that it's not the most rewarding job. But she could have bought herself a coffee with the tip alone. And I do add to the tip if my shopper does a particularly good job, or if they had to carry anything large or heavy up the stairs. 

I'm just so disappointed. I'd hate to think that this is common, or that any of my other items have ever been opened or tampered with and I just didn't notice. ",2,1742956750.0,instacart,8,0.75,False

Pastor Ellis stood on the other side, bright-eyed and crisp in his pressed shirt and tie. The look of pleasant surprise on his face quickly morphed into concern.



“Is everything alright, son?”



“Yeah, yeah, s’all good,” I nodded jerkily. His gaze dropped to the bat in my hand. “Ah,” I said, setting it aside. “Sorry about that.”



I wiped my palms off on my sweatpants, then shoved them in my hoodie pockets to keep from fidgeting. I couldn’t help glancing over the Pastor’s shoulder into the yard. 



Nothing there. Good.



“No worries,” he responded uncertainly, eyebrows drawn.



“What’d ya need?”



“I was wonderin’ if I could come in? Talk for a bit?”



“Of course. *Of course,*” I laughed, slow to process, opening the door wider and waving him in. “Sorry, don’t mind the mess. Wasn’t expectin’ guests.”



Mail was scattered across the dining room table, empty beer bottles by the couch, laundry draped over the back of a chair. I almost kicked one of Jack’s toys aside with my foot, then thought better of it and set it on top of the table.



“Had the day off work,” I explained unprompted, as though I had to justify my appearance to him. “Thought I might as well let me and Jack sleep in.”



“Oh, well, I’m sorry to have woken ya.”



“No, no, don’t apologize. Here sit,” I said, gesturing to an armchair in the living room. “Can I get ya anything? Coffee?”



“That sounds great. Thanks.”



“‘Course.”



I grabbed two mugs from the kitchen, pouring a shot of hair-of-the-dog into mine, and sat down across from him on the couch, setting the coffee on the small table between us.



“So,” I smiled, taking a long drink and trying to force myself into a personable mindset. “What di’ja wanna talk about?”



“Elijah?” interrupted a voice. “What’s goin’ on?”



We turned to see Jack standing in the hall in his pajamas, wiping the sleep from his eyes.



“Pastor Ellis’ here for a visit.”



“Oh.”



“Go on, Jackalope, say hi.”



“Hi.”



“Good morning,” the Pastor grinned lopsidedly over at him. “Good Lord, you’ve grown so much! Last time I saw ya, you were only yay high. Soon yer gonna be taller than me!”



“That’s not very tall,” Jack considered with a frown.



“Jack!” I scolded. “Don’t be rude.”



The Pastor only laughed. “Oh, don’t worry, I don’t take any offense. Out of the mouths of babes, eh? Hey, Jack, ya like animals, right?”



“Yeah,” Jack shrugged.



“I got something for ya.”



He dug around in his pocket and Jack stepped apprehensively closer. Whatever it was, I had the sudden impulse to refuse the offer. I didn’t like the idea of taking anything from him.



“I thought it looked neat. Bought it for one of my boys, but he didn’t want it. Thought I should give it to someone who would,” the Pastor explained. He pulled out a small lanky stuffed frog and held it out.



“Woah,” Jack breathed, suddenly interested. He snatched it eagerly, turning it over in his hands. “Thanks!”



“Hey, that’s a cool frog,” I commented. “Whatcha gonna name it?”



“S’not s’posed to be a frog,” Jack shook his head. “It’s a fowler’s toad, I think. Ya know they don't actually cause warts, and they’re less poisonous than the American toads. But it’s really the-”



“-the pickerels ya got to watch out for,” the Pastor finished.



Jack froze, suddenly shy again. He leaned his head toward me and attempted to whisper, “I think he can read my mind.”



The Pastor, who had heard him clearly, only raised an amused eyebrow.



Jack tensed. “*See?*” he hissed.



I sighed, dipping my head a bit to his eye level, and grabbed his shoulder. “Jackalope, ain’t nobody can read minds. And even if they could, seein’ someone’s unique perception of reality would be so incomprehensible, so maddening, that it’d be more like a-” I waved a hand, “a sorta psychotic breakdown, than any kind of mental wiretappin’.”



“Huh?”



“Listen, why don’tcha get dressed and go play out back while the grown ups talk?” I asked, patting his shoulder and gently shoving him away.



Jack side-eyed me, then stared down the Pastor, clutching the toy toad tighter in his hand, before reluctantly trudging off to his room. A few seconds later the screen of the sliding back door screeched open and shut.



“Sorry for ‘im,” I said to the Pastor, rubbing the back of my neck.



“Oh, don’t start, he’s a kid. You should hear the things mine say. No filter on any of ‘em.”



“Is that what ya came to talk about?” I joked. “Parentin’?”



“Well, sorta,” the Pastor frowned. His demeanor shifted, the tone turning heavy. I took another drink to hide my discomfort. “Ya see, after I saw ya yesterday, I went home and talked it over with my wife. And, well,” he sighed, obviously struggling to put whatever it was gently. “We want to take in Jack.”



I laughed at that. The Pastor watched me humorlessly. My smile vanished in an instant. 



“Yer serious.”



“Yes.”



“Ya wanna, what? Adopt ‘im?”



“Yes.”



“No.”



“Elijah-”



“No,” I said firmly. “I don’t care. That’s not happenin’.”



“We don’t mean anything by it, I promise,” the Pastor rushed to say. “It’s just- yer what now? Twenty something?”



“Nineteen,” I admitted.



“Christ sake, son. What kind of nineteen-year-old should be raisin’ a seven-year-old?”



I could feel myself grow tense with insult. I wanted to ask what kind of preacher takes the Lord’s name in vain. But instead I said, “He’s eight.”



“Son, listen- you should be goin’ to college-” I scoffed, but he ignored me. “-seein’ the world, makin’ mistakes, figurin’ yerself out. It’s gonna be a decade before Jack’s grown. Do ya wanna spend yer whole twenties helpin’ ‘im with homework, disciplinin’ him, workin’ all day to feed ‘im? Really, think about it-”



“I think ya should go,” I said lowly, anger crackling through my veins like live wires.



“We have a whole community to take care of ‘im. You wouldn’t have to live with the worry, the burden of it, anymore. We have the space and the money-”



“I don’t give a fuck how rich you are!” I shouted suddenly.



The Pastor blinked in shock, but didn’t raise his voice back. I inhaled shakily, surprised by myself. It wasn’t like me to lose my temper. I was always polite and dismissive - usually to a fault. 



But the way he was talking about Jack had pushed a button inside me I didn’t know existed, and the shame still fresh in my mind wasn’t helping. It filled me with dread every time it crept into my thoughts, compounding on top of everything else, and keeping me up the whole night through. I just couldn’t shake the memory of almost hitting Jack.



*Almost*, though. That was the key word. I wasn’t my grandfather.



I could control myself.



I traced the calluses of a palm with my other thumb, trying to calm down, and said, “I’m not yer ‘son’, alright? And yer not takin’ my brother. I’m his guardian. I’m his family. He’s not a goddamn burden to me.”



“That’s not at all what I meant,” the Pastor insisted, putting a hand on his bony chest. “I’m just tryin’ to be honest with ya. I know what it means to sacrifice for yer kids. Yer still a kid yerself. Ya shouldn’t have to do that.”



“But I do, and that’s the end of it.”



The Pastor huffed a breath, smiling softly. He shifted in the chair, redirecting. I could see the gears turning in his head. I considered standing up and just forcing him out, but something about his sharp gaze kept me in place.



“Elijah, do ya know the story of the man yer named after?”



“My great-grandfather?” I joked. The Pastor shot me a look. “Yeah, yeah. So, what? This a Bible study now?” I mocked.



“Humor me, please.”



“He was a prophet,” I shrugged impatiently.



“Not just any prophet. One of the greatest. One of only two men to ever be taken straight to heaven by God, never knowin’ death. He performed miracles, fought tyrants, even raised a boy from the dead. But, he was also very human. When Queen Jezebel vowed to kill Elijah, he feared for his life, he forgot God’s power. He ran into the wilderness and begged the Lord for death. He travelled to Horeb, ya know what that is don’tcha?”



“The mountain of God,” I muttered.



“Yes. And there, the Lord said He would appear before ‘im. There was a wind that tore through the mountain, shatterin’ the rocks like glass. But God was not in the wind. Then an earthquake shook the ground out from under Elijah’s feet, but He was not in the earthquake. Then a great fire singed the very sky, but He was not in the fire. And after the fire-”



“A still small voice.”



“And God was in the whisper,” the Pastor nodded.



“Yeah, I know the story. What’s yer point?”



“Yer a good man, Elijah. You feel ya have a sense of duty to yer brother, and that’s honorable. But often we try to be for others the person we needed when we had to go it on our own, regardless of if that’s what they need from us now. I know yer life hasn’t been easy. And in troubled times, it’s all too easy to become fond of the chaos. You forget how to sit with the quiet. But the quiet’s where God is. That’s where you’ll find the peace yer lookin’ for.”



I grit my teeth and looked down at the floor.



The Pastor leaned closer to me from his seat, his hands folded between his knees. “These mountains?” he said, gesturing around us. “They’re yer Horeb. Don’t go lookin’ for God in the wrong places.”



“Look,” I sighed. “I know what yer gettin’ at. I’m sorry I yelled. It’s kind of ya to offer, really. But this is where Jack belongs-”



A loud crash came from the dining room. Me and the Pastor exchanged startled glances. I stood up in an instant, rounding the corner. The window facing the back yard was cracked in the center. Droplets of blood dripped from a spider web of fractures.



I shoved open the screen door and stumbled outside, horrified at the thought of Jack bleeding out on the ground. Instead, a large crumpled crow laid twitching in the grass beneath the window. Its neck had snapped, head lolled awfully to the side. By the time the Pastor appeared beside me, it had gone still.



“*Phew*,” he whistled. “Bad luck, huh?”



Jack came running over to the commotion, stopping a few feet from the dead bird in shock. Once he realized what had happened, he rushed over to it.



“Stop,” I said quickly. “Don’t touch it. It could have all sorts of diseases.”



“But it’s hurt.” Jack looked over at me, almost offended. “We should take it to the vet.”



I shook my head, hiding the wince the movement caused. I could feel a migraine coming on already. I wished I hadn’t left my mug inside.



“It’s dead.”



“Ya don’t know that. I’ll grab a shoebox to put it in. We need to drive it over real quick.”



“There’s no use, Jack. It’s gone.”



“We have to try!” he said frantically. I was surprised by how worked up he was getting.



“Hey,” I said, kneeling down. “C’mere.”



Jack didn’t move, refusing to leave the battered crow’s side.



“We can bury it in the yard, alright?” I offered. “Pay our respects. And ya can keep some of the feathers. That sound good?”



“No! It just needs a hospital!”



“Look at it. It’s nature. Ain’t nothin’ we can do about it.”



“That’s not true!”



“I’m not drivin’ to the vet, Jack.”



He sucked in a breath at that, eyebrows drawn like I’d betrayed him. Then he looked back down at the crow. Brittle body contorted, oil slick tinted feathers wet with blood, a sliver of sky reflected in one glassy unseeing eye. I couldn’t see Jack’s face, but I watched his shoulders fall. He hung his head slightly, almost in reverence, all the fight leaving him at once. When he turned back around, my breath caught a bit. There was a numbness to his expression that didn’t suit a child. I saw my own pain in him, and it terrified me.



Gently, Jack pushed past the Pastor and went back inside the house. I was about to call after him, when the Pastor put his hand on my shoulder. “Let ‘im go.”



I shrugged off his hand resentfully.



“Granny always fed the crows,” I said, more to myself than him. “I think that’s what’s got ‘im so upset…”



Sometimes I thought I still saw her out of the corner of my eye. Standing outside in her sundress, sprinkling walnuts and grain in front of the porch. They’d leave her things in return. Rocks, screws, earrings, coins, and buttons left scattered across the steps.



“That’s the thing about crows,” she told me once, voice lowered, like it was a secret. “People’ll act like they’re monsters, but they’re not. They’re just tryin’ to tell ya something, if yer not too scared to listen. And if yer kind to ‘em, you’ll get as good as ya give.”



What was this message then? A warning? A sign to get our windows replaced? A good old fashioned suicide?



“Well,” I sighed. “I’ll take care of this. You should prob’ly get goin’.”



“Of course,” the Pastor said graciously. “Do keep in mind what I said. You can take us up on it anytime. And, if there’s ever anything ya need, I’m here for ya. Yer not alone in this.”



“You’ve made that very clear,” I said, not gracious at all.



The Pastor just smiled that smug, understanding smile. Somehow backhanded and sincere all at once. For all his pretty words, I never found his presence any less unnerving. “You have a good day now, alright?” he said, nodding goodbye before making his way around the side of the house toward the driveway.



Once he had left, I grabbed a shovel from the garage. I scooped up the crow with it (it was lighter than I had expected, given it was almost as big as a young possum) and placed it a few steps into the woods, on a patch of moss. I picked a few wildflowers and laid them on it, then sprinkled walnuts beside the body. A small ceremony I hoped would free me of any of Granny’s superstitions.



I heard cawing from above, and looked up to see a few crows in the branches nearby, some swooping through the sky. There was a rustle off to the distance behind me, twigs cracking, but I didn’t look. All the same, I felt the sudden inexplicable urge to walk deeper into the forest. The same feeling I’d had when the Pastor was at the door. Like it would be rude and paranoid of me not to answer the call.



I caught myself taking a step forward, and froze. Then I looked back and blinked in disbelief. I was already a few yards away from where I’d left the crow, in a patch of woods far away from any trail or footpath. I’d been walking without even realizing it, breathing hard with the effort it took not to continue on.



Forcibly, like tearing myself free of someone’s grip, I turned around. I swallowed down my panic and bolted for the yard. The moment I broke into a run, the danger became real. My boots tripped over the weeds and roots as I stumbled and flew my way between the trees. It only took a few seconds for me to break out from the tree line. I whipped around to see if anything was following me, but only the crows were there.



I caught my breath, clutching my chest, watching them gather in the branches, feeling foolish. I was driving myself insane, wasn’t I? Assigning meaning where there wasn’t any. Just a dead crow. Yeah, just a dead fucking bird.



I washed the blood from the window as quickly as possible, desperate to get back inside, wringing out the rust colored water into a bucket with shaking hands. I’d have to call someone to come replace the glass pane, but that was a problem for another day. I went inside grateful to finally get some sleep. If Jack wanted breakfast, he’d have to fend for himself today.



A while later I was woken up by Jack again, but he was just crawling quietly into bed beside me, so I didn’t take any issue with it. I cracked open my eyes to see what time it was. By the golden light filtering into the empty bedroom, illuminating swirls of dust motes, I guessed it was late afternoon.



There was something magical about that time of day. The wooden walls seemed a warmer brown, everything the sun touched was gilded, the air felt fresh and calming. I felt much better than before, content and drowsy, my headache gone. So I watched the dust stir around peacefully for a while, eyes half open. There wasn’t much else to look at. I hadn’t done anything to really make the room mine. Just my jacket hung by the door, next to the gloves from when I used to box. Piles of work clothes discarded in the corner. Some old books on my nightstand I hadn’t touched, beside a few family photos and a bottle opener. If I ever wanted to move away, I could put pretty much everything I owned in a backpack, and there would be no trace of me left in the house but my childhood heights marked into a doorpost.



Jack stared at the ceiling for a long time, as I faded in and out of consciousness, before I heard him whisper, “Elijah?”



“Yeah?” My voice came out scratchy with sleep.



“Do you still believe in heaven?”



“‘Course,” I lied. The question instantly snapped me awake, though I tried to sound casual. Jack had picked a poor time, but this conversation was bound to happen eventually. I needed to be careful how I answered. I pushed myself up a bit with my back against the headboard.



“What do ya think it’s like?” Jack asked up toward the ceiling. He held up the stuffed toad the Pastor had given him, swinging it back and forth in the air above him. “Is it like fallin’ asleep and wakin’ up there? Or does an angel come get ya?”



I wondered how Mom would have responded to that. She was always making up wild stories instead of admitting when she didn’t know the answer. The sky was blue, because that was the only color paint God had left on his pallet by the time he got to it. The sun rose in the east so people in the west had time to sleep in. Rabbits burrowed underground, because that’s where carrots grew. Dad was never around, because he was an astronaut exploring the night sky, or a cowboy travelling the deserts in search of gold.



“Well,” I said, carrying on her legacy, “Ya know about the black train?”



“No?”



“It’s this massive steam engine,” I went on with a sweeping gesture, trying to pull him into the story. “Coated in coal dust so thick, no one knows what color it really is underneath. It travels like a shadow, doesn’t even need tracks.” Admittedly, I was plagiarizing the Carter Family song a bit by this point. I decided to add some stuff of my own. “The grim reaper’s the conductor, but he’s really just a friendly young guy with a Creole accent and a great big mustache. And the angels of death are the firemen and ticket inspectors, with holes cut in their uniforms for their wings. When ya die, ya hear its whistle in the distance, its pistons firin’, its wheels chuggin’. It pulls up wherever you are, and when ya step into the compartment, all yer family and friends who’ve passed on are waitin’ for ya there. Ya take yer seat and travel with ‘em right up to heaven. There’s live music playin’ and ever’body’s happy to see ya again. You can even watch the sky pass by through the windows, until the train pulls right up to the gates of heaven.”



“Ya really believe all that?”



“‘Course I do.”



“Do the animals get on it too?”



“I imagine they have little trains of their own.”



“Is that where the crow is now?”



“Crows don’t need trains. They get to fly up to God on their wings.”



“And Papaw?”



I smiled. “Aw, he’s bound to be at heaven by now. Playin’ guitar, crackin’ jokes, and sittin’ out on the porch of his mansion with Granny.”



“When will I hear the train?” he asked brightly, almost eager.



“Not for a long time yet, Jackalope. Ya got plenty to do beforehand. But it’ll be there for ya when it’s time.”



Jack hummed, disappointed. He crawled over to me, partly in my lap, and put his head on my shoulder. “Can ya sing the song? The one Mama used to?”



One of my earliest memories was sitting out with our mom on the steps as a toddler. Back when she was healthy and vibrant and my entire world condensed into a person. She’d brush her long hair over a shoulder and sing me songs while I danced clumsily around her. And she’d clap her hands to the rhythm or help guide my steps.



I wished Jack had got to have that too. All he had was the lullabies I’d passed on to him.



I didn’t have a good singing voice. Too deep and rough and offkey, without any of the charm Papaw’s had managed. But Jack didn’t seem to mind.



“The other night, dear, as I lay sleepin’, I dreamed I held you in my arms. But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken. So I hung my head and cried,” I sang softly, brushing his hair. “You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away.”



It overwhelmed me, the melancholic lyrics, my voice solitary in the silence, my childhood memories crashing into the image of Jack dozing off in my arms. So, I didn’t notice that another voice, soft as a whisper, had joined mine, until my voice broke.



“-you'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please-” I choked, swallowing down the rising itch in my throat.



“-don't take my sunshine away,” finished the echo.



It was so distant, I almost thought I’d imagined it.



“Jack?” I asked hesitantly.



He was heavy with sleep in my arms, chest rising and falling evenly. I pulled him gently off my lap and back onto the bed. He grumbled, curling onto his side with the toad hugged to his face.



I walked down the hall, in the direction I’d heard the voice, just to make sure I was only hearing things. Nothing was out of place, except my grandparents’ door, which was slightly ajar. I could’ve sworn I’d left it shut. I went to close it, figuring the wind had blown it open, when I noticed something missing from the bedside.



Papaw’s guitar was gone.



I hadn’t moved it from where he’d left it, in its spot against the wall by their nightstand. I went into the room and looked to see if it had fallen over or been misplaced, but it was nowhere to be found. I checked Jack’s room next, to see if he had taken it, but it wasn’t there either.



Across the house, I heard a slow rhythmic *thud, thud, thud* of wood against wood.



Suddenly on alert again, my mind raced to remember where I’d left the baseball bat. A new wave of dread hit me as I remembered. By the front door, where the sound was coming from.



I looked around Jack’s room for anything I could use, and grabbed his hunting knife from the top of the dresser. My pulse quickened as soon as it was in my hand. There was something viscerally damning about holding a knife, when there was only one possible use for it.



I crept toward the corner of the hall and carefully glanced around.



The front door was wide open. The wind was pushing it against the adjacent wall, again and again, like breathing. *Thud, thud thud*. But the bat was still there, as was the TV in the living room. Obviously no one had broken in. If they had, why hadn't they stolen a weapon or anything of value?



I relaxed a bit, my grip on the knife looser, and walked over to shut the door. As I got closer, I noticed a bit of broken wood outside on the porch, partly blocked from view by the doorframe. I stepped out to investigate and stopped dead.



At the foot of Papaw’s chair, was the guitar.



It had been smashed beyond repair, the neck snapped clean in half like a broken spine, the body crushed into splinters. Barely recognizable, except for the mangled strings sticking out in frayed steel coils. Something fell and clattered against the floorboards, making me flinch back a step. It was a tuning peg.



I looked up at the porch roof, and saw parts of the guitar up in the rafters, as though they’d been blown there by an explosion. “*The hell?*” I mouthed, barely a whisper. I couldn’t think of a single explanation for it. The guitar had been wrecked so thoroughly, it was almost inhuman. And the whole time, we hadn’t heard any noise at all.



*There are things in the mountains*, I realized, recalling what I’d thought to myself after walking in the woods with Jack. *And they don’t like music.*



I stumbled backwards, throwing the front door shut and locking it. It didn’t make any sense. It didn’t make any sense. It didn’t make any-



Jack screamed from my bedroom, a high blood-curdling shriek of panic. I threw myself down the hall without thinking and was at the door in a second.



He was sitting up in my bed, the blankets pulled to his chest for protection, staring at the window with wide eyes. He saw me and immediately tumbled from the bed and raced to my side, hiding behind my leg with his hands fisted into my shirt.



A crow was standing outside the window, its talons buried into the sill. It slowly reared back its head and slammed its beak into the glass, cracking the same spot over and over again, like it was trying to break through. Its neck was at a ninety degree angle, so that its head was turned fully sideways, limp as it flung back and forth. Mangled bone jutted out from its side and crumpled wildflowers were tangled up in the feathers of its wing.



Behind it, crows filled the yard. They descended from the treetops unhurriedly, pecking at the ground and hopping back and forth, seemingly uninterested in us. But there were far too many, easily over a hundred, scattered around like writhing ticks on a deer.



The crow at the window slammed its battered head into the glass again, its beak breaking through and sending small glass shards across the floor. It didn’t react, hitting the same spot again, even as it cut its face open on the sharp edges. Bright blood stained the glass in dark droplets and orange-tinted smears.



Wordlessly, I gathered Jack into my arms, careful not to cut him on the knife still clutched in my hand. And, never taking my eyes off the crow, I snatched my car keys from the night stand.  
  


“Bury yer head in my shoulder and close yer eyes,” I whispered firmly. “No matter what ya hear, no matter how curious ya are, don’t open them again until I tell ya to. Do ya understand?”



I felt Jack nod.



“Say it.”



“I won’t open my eyes,” he whimpered.



“Promise me.”



“I promise.”



“Alright. I’m gonna get us out of here safe, okay? Everything’s gonna be fine.”



It took everything in me not to break into a run the second I turned away from the window. But as casually as possible, breathing steadily, I walked Jack down the hall and out the front door. The walk from the porch steps to my truck felt endless. I focused on the ground, trying to ignore the curious caws and flutters of the birds around us. They filled my peripheral vision, steadily closing the distance to the driveway, like a pack of coyotes circling closer.



I unlocked the driver’s side door and helped Jack across the console into the passenger seat. He kept his eyes screwed shut, throwing his hands over them the second he could. There was a blur of motion by his window, as a crow beat its wings against the truck, talons screeching across the glass. Jack screamed again, curling in on himself with his head beneath the dashboard.



I scrambled inside after him and slammed the door closed. A crow narrowly missed diving right inside with us and crashed into the window beside my head. I jumped violently, forcing myself to keep moving and put the key in the ignition. Around us, frenzied thunks came from the hood, ceiling, and bed of the truck, hard enough to shake the frame on its suspension. The cawing reached a deafening fever pitch.



The truck’s engine roared to life and I stared hard at the steering wheel to keep from looking out the windshield. I pulled around in a jerk of motion. Something smacked into the fender. The wheels rolled over a sudden bump, followed by a sickening crunch. Then another and another. Neither Jack or I had our seatbelts on, and we were thrown around as I floored the truck in the direction of the road, refusing to look out at the yard, even in the rear view mirror.



In my mind, a whole murder of them was chasing after us, diving toward the car. But as soon as we passed the property line, the cawing died down and fell into the background. As though they had hunted us to the road, and then simply given up. Still, I waited until I was certain the house was fully out of sight, before telling Jack it was safe to look, and drove us straight to the motel in town to spend the night.



The neon red glow of the vacancy sign cut through the smoggy dusk and lit our way into the lot. The motel was a one-story row of rooms - all dry rot exteriors, scummy carpets, whirring AC units, and industrial laundry detergent. I twisted our room key into the flimsy lock and led Jack inside, barricading the door with a nightstand. From the room next to ours came the muffled shouting of some domestic spat. Shadows flit past the thin curtains of the only window. I still felt terribly exposed, with only this cardboard box separating us from the distant slam of doors, churn of tires over gravel, and the vast expanse of forest beyond the road.



I kept catching myself smiling and laughing senselessly under my breath from the nerves, and I forced myself to stop. I didn’t want to freak out Jack further.



But even with cable playing on the boxy CRT TV to drown out the sound, I couldn’t sleep. And if Jack heard it, he never mentioned it. It kept me up, never tuning out into white noise, a fresh hell drilling its way into my brain every second. Like grating voices chanting back and forth in an overlapping choir. A swarming siren that grew in intensity until I started to think it was coming from inside my head, echoing through the walls of my skull, drowning out any rational thought.



The crows shouted their messages, their enraged pleas and urgent threats, until their calls sounded hoarse and bloody, for hours until dawn.",1,1742956577.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1jk1mwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BendyAndTheInkMachine/comments/1jk1mwy/ive_reposted_my_story_bendy_and_the_lost_ones_and/,I’ve reposted my story: “BENDY AND THE LOST ONES” and changed some parts. I will continually change the story when I make new characters.,"**PROLOGUE:**

our story begins when audrey, (now with control over the cycle) went to get some coffee from downstairs. But when she returned, she realised the book controlling the cycle disappeared! She realised someone stole it, and took it for themself. in the cycle, we pan to a lost one named Michelle. Michelle is in Charge of searching for supplies to keep the lost ones safe & healthy, but when she exits, she notices a stairwell she didn’t notice before. She goes through it and ends up on another floor of the studio: Level M. She searches for any life, but comes across a GENT Pipe. This seems to have been upgraded by someone… and she then is ambushed by the butcher gang. they knock her out, but before She blacks out, a mysterious figure takes out all the butcher gang.

**CHAPTER 1: “IN A DARK PLACE”**

Michelle then wakes up to find herself inside some sort of bedroom, and then she exits the room and finds herself inside some sort of safehouse. She then meets a searcher-lost one-mix whose name is Allen. allen agrees to help Michelle find out the secrets of the lost Levels. Allen gives Michelle a key and she leaves. Michelle comes across a door, and it could only be opened by a switch in a nearby storage room. The storage room is gated of though, and Allen seeps under the gate. She then flicks the lever and leaves Michelle to fight for herself. After entering the door, we see a small figure scurrying away. Michelle corners the figure, and it’s revealed to be a small fellow named “Benny.” Benny is small, scared, and has a mechanical arm that can access executive-access doors. they both briefly encounter a version of The Ink Demon. This is a minion of the much more big And powerful Ink Demon. Michelle and Benny both get in a little miracle station, and the demon leaves them alone. They both press on and enter a small storage room. After getting swarmed by searchers, they continue into a large storage warehouse. here, Michelle finds a GENT Pipe upgrade. a syringe for getting rid of searchers easier. They come across a flooded staircase that they need to drain. they find a valve and they insert it into a pipe. But when michelle turned the valve, the ink started groaning… the ink was calling to her… a big glowing spiral appeared on her left hand and torso… She could now **BANISH.** The stairwell drains And They eventually make it to Level 8. They both see another Ink Demon Minion, this time being battled by a lost one. This time wearing suspenders and welding a wrench, and an axe. the Ink Demon Minion runs from her and disappeared into a wall. It is revealed her name is Carla, and she trusts Michelle because she took care of Benny for her. They both wander into a safehouse of sorts where there is a bunch of friendly lost ones and a pile of bacon soup cans. Carla explains how the Ink Demons Michelle has met were mere clones of a much larger, more powerful ink demon. Located in a large cavern containing a gigantic “REEL INK MACHINE.” and the only way to defeat the REEL Ink Demon, he Has to first be vulnerable. And you do this by turning off the REEL INK MACHINE.

**”CHAPTER 2: OLD FAMILY RECIPE”**

They all exit the safehouse, and get attacked by more searchers, but this time, Michelle has an upgraded GENT Pipe. She easily takes them out. They find a large room With giant vats of Bacon Soup. AKA: The Bacon Soup Production Plant. After turning on the Bacon Soup Machines, the next room is unlocked, but an Ink Demon Minion lurks nearby. After staying quiet and hiding behind the Bacon Soup Vats, the Ink Demon Minion walks away. they gang find an elevator that has 3 buttons. One to Level M, Level 8, and Level D. They all go to level D, and get out of the Elevator. they wander down a corridor and see Sammy walking down the end of it. He notices The gang and quickly hides behind a door, which he locks. The gang wander around and enter a room where there’s another section of the Bacon Soup Production plant. This time, there are winding corridors and offices, and there are lost ones wandering all around. after The gang navigates the offices they end up at a large bendy statue in front of a giant vat of bacon soup. the door that sammy went through required a key. And that key was somewhere in the area… behind the bendy statue, there were the studios “Visual Design Offices.” But now these halls lurk with Lost ones with machines for their heads… they all welded different weapons and all were roaming the halls of the offices. after the gang followed arrows drawn on walls while being undetected by “THE LOST MACHINES” they found a large two story office. In this office there was a man who Michelle had heard on tapes. He was the head of the Visual Design Offices and he had the keys to all the doors in the cycle. His name was Richard. he called the  LOST MACHINES to his office and they had a big fight. After a long battle with tons of LOST MACHINES, they got up to Richard‘s desk And banished Richard And took his keys. But when Michelle **BANISHED** Richard, the ink called again. the Spiral on her torso stretched to her right hand… she could now summon sculptures of ink With **EASE.** After they unlocked the room Sammy entered, Sammy ambushed them, resulting in a boss fight. after the gang defeated Sammy, they got to a part where three levers must be flicked at the same time. After the gang does so, there are bashing and clanging sounds coming from Benny‘s location. Carla runs to investigate and a door shuts behind Michelle. Leaving Michelle alone. She finds a long corridor with a door at the end of it. She walks up to it and enters the room. It’s a control room with a pedestal in the center. There’s a big window and two doors left and right. Suddenly, the wall where the window is is broken open, revealing a giant ink demon standing in-front. The REEL INK DEMON. Michelle must navigate through caves all around the large cavern while trying to find three objects and place them in three control rooms. She does so and pulls a switch in a main control room. after that, it turns off the REEL INK MACHINE. this opens a door to her right. behind it is a stairwell, and at the bottom is a tram. She enters the tram and it goes through a door. a door closes behind the tram and another one opens in-front. the tram goes through a long, inky pipe.

**”CHAPTER 3: INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCT”**

another door closes behind the tram and one opens Infront revealing a tram station. she navigates through some mysterious corridors and even Enters a recreation of the foyer of chapter one of Bendy And The Ink Machine. She tries going To where the exit door was, but there is a gate in the way. She must open it. She goes to where henrys desk would be, but she finds a room full of jail cells. One with Tom and Allison, one with Sammy, one with The Projectionist, and one with Henry. She talks to Allison and Tom, and they tell her that to make things go back to normal, she needs to find a film reel labelled “THE END.” And Allison tells Michelle that the ink demon Used an ink machine thing to make himself one with the end reel. trapping it inside him. After that Michelle enters a hole in a wall in the tram Station, and it lead to a room that has three pedestals… it looks like there are three more that used to be there, but are now not. She exits out a door and finds a large room with a shelf with large Ink pipes above, and a large ink tank to the side. Infront of it is a power switch. But the switch does nothing. She finds the three missing objects in the BATIM chapter 1 recreation and puts Them on the three pedestals. She pulls the switch That did nothing, and it did something. The door that lead to the exit in the chapter 1 recreation opened. But behind the gate was an elevator. She goes up and there is two big tubes. She enters through An open door in one of the tubes, and she gets sucked through inky pipes through the REEL INK MACHINE. She come out as a cartoonish-human. more of a silhouette, but human. She was made of ink But wasn’t dripping everywhere? but then… the ink called again. the spiral than connected to her legs. She could now go into certain puddles, and climb out of other ones. She entered a puddle, and came out in another train station. she got on a tram, and it led to an area where she found a dock where she found a boat. She went through a door and behind it was ladder. This lead to a long hallway and at the end she was met with another control room. She met up with Carla and Benny who were in the control room. Carla commented on Michelle’s human appearance and brushed it off. the Ink demon was still a threat though. So they had to act quickly. carla went to a control panel and operated a giant crane and helped Michelle to defeat the ink demon. Michelle found A drill and used it to attack the giant ink demon. When Carla hit the demon and had it knocked over, michelle travelled To the ink demon through the ink and hacked the demon to pieces. and when it was weak enough, Michelle dove Into the demon through a hole on his back. Michelle traversed tunnels inside of the ink demon and found a film reel in his chest labelled “The End.” Michelle took this item and escaped the demon. When she got out, she went to the crane control room and a Door has opened. She walks through and finds a pipe in the ground. Michelle Jumped into the pipe, and ended up in a room with a projector in the centre. She placed the “THE END” Reel on it, but was ambushed by a group of searchers, lost ones, LOST MACHINES, and butcher gang members. but then, the gang came back together and fought them all off. Everyone was there, including Allen! After a battle, Michelle placed the film reel on the projector, and turned it on…

**“EPILOGUE”**

Michelle woke up in joeys abandoned apartment as a human in normal clothes. She looked around The abandoned apartment and found a door. She opened the door, and got to the lost ones’ safe house. Back at the beginning, but with her powers…

I have a private fb group and private subreddit group call the underground we are an underground resistance movement, we are a community of chaotic good, more on that later.

I have a friend who has created a civics and political awareness booklet, think of it like a modern day Common Sense or The Federalist Papers, meant to inform people about constitutional rights, voting, and the policies shaping our future, including the Constitution, Project 2025, Russia, etc. This is incredible, well thought out and easy to read for the everyday American.  
These booklets aren't online- they're completely physical copies meant to be passed around, left in public spaces and shared anonymously. So far, friends in five states have been discreetly leaving them in coffee shops, libraries, and other random places. We just need more people to help get them out to a wider audience. She's wanting to stay anonymous, I have personally vetted her and she's legit, she requests privacy and I respect that. She is personally mailing people 20 booklets, or will email you the booklet with instructions on how to print it. Issue 1 went out 2 weeks ago and Issue 2 goes out April 1st.  
If you'd like to get in on this comment or DM- I will get your mailing address or e-mail to her this could disrupt everything, she's brilliant

We are also getting simple, ""All American"" flyers out explaining the impacts of federal cuts and what's happening with the TrumpMusk admin.

According to some estimates, the annual cost of feeding a family in Sweden has gone up by as much as 30,000 kronor (£2,290) since January 2022. A packet of coffee is soon expected to reach the symbolic threshold of 100 kronor (£7.64). That’s an increase of more than a quarter since early last year, according to the government agency Statistics Sweden.

Last week, after the biggest rise in food prices for two years in February, thousands of people across Sweden decided to vote with their feet, boycotting the country’s biggest supermarkets for seven days from last Monday.

Helped by viral posts on TikTok and Instagram, the campaign has become a national topic of conversation and a political flashpoint.

Protesters blame the rise in prices on an “oligopoly” of supermarkets and big producers prioritising their profits over customers, and a lack of competition between companies. But supermarkets blame far-ranging factors including war, geopolitics, commodity prices, harvests and the climate emergency.

It is one of several cost-of-living protests that have unfolded across [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news) in recent weeks. Shoppers in Bulgaria boycotted big retail chains and supermarkets last month in protest at rising food prices, reportedly leading to a drop in turnover of almost 30%. In January, a boycott in Croatia spread to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.

The minister of rural affairs, Peter Kullgren, said price rises had been caused by largely international factors such as higher commodity prices due to crop failures, but said that competition in trade needed improving.

On Friday, the government also presented a new food strategy that included measures to increase Swedish food production. Kullgren said he wants to see better competition in the food industry, including the launch of new grocery stores to encourage competition throughout the country.",1,1742955356.0,europes,0,1.0,False

Currently 39M 5'11"" @ 188 LBS and I know I need to be leaner.

I intermediate fast 7 days a week and don't eat until 11am-12pm when my son has his lunch. I go out to eat with my wife for 2 meals a week, typically on the weekends for dinner. I mainly drink water with lemon juice or black coffee. No soft drinks or juices. However...I definitely drink alcohol (mainly beer) and I know that this is the main cause of my excess weight. Drinking leads to poor eating, bad sleep and mediocre workouts. When I cut back on the booze, the results appear. 

From a workout perspective, I do PPL 3X a week. In the past, I have done PPL 6X a week but that was prior to the kiddo and its just a lot to do. The 4 other days in the week, I get between 7k-12k of steps in depending on the weather.

With all that being said, I wanted to get feedback based on the info from the [TDEE Calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/). For the ""cutting"" macro's, the recommendation is to have 227g of protein.

Below is a breakdown of my 5 current meals based on Calories (c), Protein (p) and Fiber (f). I haven't tracked carbs or fat yet but I can find that information out and input the data if desired --

* Calories (c) = \~1,800 
* Protein (p) = \~187 
* Fiber (f) = \~37

1. Hard Boiled Egg 140c / 12g / 0f
2. Veggie Omelette 520c / 33p / 16f
3. Fruit/Veggie Smoothie 370c / 47p / 10f
4. Air Fried Chicken + Veggie 380c / 34p / 5f
5. Fruit Greek Yogurt 390c / 61p / 6f

Based on the TDEE calculator, I am roughly 40g short of protein per day. Any thoughts on my nutrition and how I can improve it? I am open to any thoughts in general, thanks!

She asked the janitor if she could call me before she got kicked out and he said no. 
I'm not sure if this is child endangerment so if anyone has any advice on how I could maybe get her unbanned or maybe reason with the pool about this cause after work we went back and staff at the front desk said she couldn't come back and I could in fact NOT get a refund on the pass. It was a two dollar cup. This is insane

I'm working on a project that helps expose government waste and abuse, and I'm trying to get the word out specifically to government employees—at all levels (federal, state, local). These are the folks who are most likely to *see* things on the inside and have stories worth sharing.

I'm not looking to spam anyone or do anything shady—just want to raise awareness that this platform exists and encourage honest people to speak up if they want to.

Does anyone have good ideas for how to reach government workers? Any forums, newsletters, unions, conferences, coffee shops near agencies, subreddits, etc. that I should know about?

Totally open to guerrilla-style ideas too. Appreciate any suggestions!

1jk12z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/lesbiangang/comments/1jk12z8/i_have_the_biggest_crush_of_my_life_and_the_mixed/,I have the biggest crush of my life… and the mixed signals are tormenting me,"Hey y’all. I’m not publicly out to nearly anyone in my life so I have no one to turn to for advice or opinions. So here I am. If you’re not up for a novel, feel free to skip, I am long winded. 😅

I’m experiencing the most insane crush for one of the first times in my life and I’m in my mid 20s. But I cannot tell how she feels or if she likes me. I don’t even know if she’s queer. (Yes I know I could ask her straight out but I wanted to come here before ever going that route)

First off, she lives in Europe and I’m in the states.  I’ve known her for almost 3 years now- we meet in person about twice a year in Europe for work related events (we’re both writers/in film). She’s 29 and has never really dated. A lot of her friends are gay men and she’s very liberal and open minded. She has the biggest heart and will treat anyone like her best friend, so sometimes things are hard to read. We were all drunk once and she and our female friend started making out for fun, stumbling in the street. It was all in fun and she quickly grabbed my hand, laughing, and we all ran off like juveniles. 

We’ve always texted over the years on and off but this last summer I ran into her unexpectedly at a festival. Like literally ran into her. Although she was there staying with other friends we spent most all our free time together— picnics and lunch, clubbing, drinks, she bought us pastries for the beach and we swam and watched the sun rise after an all nighter on the town. (She later texted me saying she wish she would’ve taken pictures of me on the beach because it would’ve been “perfect with the light”) We sat on the asphalt cross legged like children and shared gelato. She called me in a panic one night asking if I had gotten home safe… our goodbye this last time was different (to me at least) - she loves hugs, as do I, so we hugged a lot. I saw her off on a bus and we waved until we couldn’t see each other. Then texted immediately. (Though she’s fluent, English isn’t her first language- she speaks about 6- so she says things in such an adorable way to me sometimes.) she said she missed me a lot already and would “even miss me when her brain rewired” - we were running on no sleep for a week. 

After that she would send hearts out of the blue, we would share music, send voice messages where she’d giggle and say she’s sending me kisses (oh, my heart) and send voices updating each other on day to day life. Then after a few months, radio silence. It lasted through the holidays and I decided not to push it- I had sent the last message and the last thing I want to do is annoy her. (If they wanted to, they would, right?) 

Then one January day I receive two videos, about 5 minutes total. In them, she apologizes and talks about how she’s known for being bad at responding to texts, but never this bad. She had some personal things going on, a very sick family member she had to take care of, loss of a secure job and whatnot. She said it’s been bothering her we haven’t talked but she didn’t know how to approach me so she just pressed record and started talking. She babbles for awhile sheepishly and ends the first video. The second starts with her taking a deep breath and saying what she was trying to say is that she misses me. Genuinely. And laughed at herself for rambling on for minutes just to tell me she missed me. She goes on to say she thinks I’m an amazing person and she’s “so so so” happy we reconnected this past summer and is sending me love. 

Well. I replied with a video of my own, and my pet was in it. She replied saying we “are both precious.” We texted more consistently, and began video calls every other week or so. We have to work around time zones, but make it work. She’s always the one to initiate the calls. They are always 1-2 hours long, or more. We have such good conversations outside of updating each other, but about goals and creative work, travel, religion, politics… it flows so lovely and we only focus on each other for those hours. It’s my absolute favorite. 

She always likes or comments my stories on social media. Recently she’s made comments during our calls here and there like that my eyes looked pretty, my outfit looked nice, that I can come stay with her whenever and she’d love to cook for me. I’ve been burnt out lately and expressed this, she said she’d “wrap me in a blanket, make me a tea and massage my hands until I slept” … I said I’d cry if anyone ever treated me like that. She just smiled. 

Now this all sounds great, going good for me and all, except she really is an awful texter. It’s at least a day in between responses, sometimes close to a week. Then she’ll be good for awhile, and back to poor again. She’s stated she’s bad at texting before, but I just have such a hard time believing she would like me if she takes so long to respond. She texts me and my heart leaps at the notification and I just want to stop what I’m doing and reply. I do think there’s a lot of truth to the “if they wanted to they would” idea, but the signals I’m getting are such polar opposites sometimes I am just so confused.

Is she just a flirty European? I will say I haven’t reciprocated much flirting (if that’s what it is) because I’m unsure, I freeze up and get very shy. But I blush and I believe she can tell over video. But I can’t imagine her having feelings, and then seeing my text for 5 days and just not taking a bit of time to respond. But maybe she wants to give a proper response- I can be bad at replying to friends and family. But a crush is … different. 

I can’t believe how enamored with her I am. She’s so intelligent and kind and soft and stunning. She is so funny and isn’t afraid to be dorky or silly in front of others— she’s unapologetically herself. I have a hard time even believing she would find an interest in me friend-wise let alone romantically. She is perfect to me. I want to cook with her and cuddle on the couch after our shifts. I want to wake up alongside her and make her coffee in the mornings the way she likes it and travel with her, teach her how to drive my car. Have someone to finally watch sunsets with…

I’m the first to be an advocate for finding yourself and learning how to be independent while single, etc etc. But I’ve backpacked over 50 countries, stayed in hostels, slept on floors, worked in dozens of countries and met and befriended people from all walks of life. And out of all the souls I’ve met on my adventures, hers is the most radiant to me. I also think I’d finally like to know what sharing is like. 

Anyways. If you made it this far I commend you, thank you. I’ll take any opinions, advice, critiques, whatnot and otherwise. I’m sure there’s things I’ve missed but I just needed to get this out of my system, so even if I’m talking to the void, I’m still grateful.

1jk0y0q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jk0y0q,My moka pot cheat code,"I had been making coffee with my cheap electric grinder (non burr) for a while now, but I wanted to improve my brew so I got myself a Timemore C3 ESP grinder. I've tried 1.0 and 0.9, and more settings but for some reason after using it I kept getting sour (and a bit more watery?) coffee. I've also played with the water temperature, amount of water to coffee ratio, tapping the gasket, etc. but I just couldn't get the brew I wanted.

I went to a different city, brought my grinder, got different beans, used a french press, and set my grind settings to 2.4. French press coffee was good! I went back home and used my moka pot, but I forgot to change my grind setting so I had to grind twice. 2.4 and then 0.9. I loved the coffee!

The next few days after that I had the same problem as before (watery, sour coffee), then I realized that I really liked the coffee I made when I ground them twice. I started grinding twice and I keep loving the results! With other coffee beans I play around with the second grind setting, but the first one is always 2.4. It's also much easier for my hands, grinding straight to 0.9 was just so hard and was not a pleasant experience in the morning 😂

I think grinding twice makes better extraction and it's an important step I do now.

1jk0xxl,https://i.redd.it/h1h8mpstuxqe1.jpeg,How I design magic systems- A guide.,"Do you want to design a magic system for your world?

When I design a magic system, the first thing I think of is something I find interesting. Remember, you don't need something comprehensive. You don't need something perfect. You need something you would love to write about.

I always liked the idea of density manipulation. I would like to write about it, especially if said manipulation could increase one's strength as well.

After this broad concept, I like to think of the source. The source could be something that is everywhere, or it could be more exclusive. Write what you love, but I think exclusive resources contribute a lot to your worldbuilding, but it does mean a richer mage will have a greater advantage. I often have multiple magic systems in my world to negate this being a big problem.

For the example system of density manipulation, let's say there is a rare creature that has mana. You can eat the creature, or perhaps send coffee beans through it's digestive system (🤮) to get mana out of it. We will call these creatures gorillas. They are being over hunted, which may be important to the plot. If gorillas go extinct, so does an entire magic system.

You may also consider who can use it. Is it genetic? Is it divine? It it for the educated only? Can anyone use it? Can animals?

For the example system, let's say humans and gorillas can use it. However, someone practicing a different magic cannot use it.

Next I develop what the system actually does, and its limits.

In our example of the gorilla eating density manipulators, we can further expand the density manipulation. You can add weight to things, and recall that weight, with a range of touch. Skilled users can change the direction of the weight relative to the gravity you experience, meaning very skilled users can increase structural integrity, decrease weight, or increase the strength of blows. There is a slow rate of decay which increases as things you affect are further. You could use this power on people too- even kill them, but it is still limited by touch.

One optional thing to add is a catalyst- something either required to channel the magic, or something that assists it. The difference between a source and a catalyst is that a catalyst isn't expended.

In our example, I think it would be interesting if some material, perhaps pure enough iron (not steel) could channel the power, increasing the range of touch. A wrought iron staff is now a quite viable weapon for a mage, and looks pretty cool in my opinion.",0,1742954482.0,magicbuilding,0,0.4,False

I set up a packet sniffer on my laptop at a local coffee shop and monitored traffic for 24 hours - 12 hours without VPN and 12 hours with ProtonVPN enabled.

Results were... scary? Here's what I found:

WITHOUT VPN (12 hours):

* Could see unencrypted website requests from \~40% of users
* Captured 27 unencrypted login attempts (!!!)
* Identified devices, OS versions, and browsing patterns for most users
* Was able to inject harmless (but scary) JavaScript into 12 browsing sessions
* Identified 6 devices with serious vulnerabilities

WITH VPN (12 hours):

* Zero visibility into browsing activities
* Could only see encrypted VPN traffic
* Unable to identify anything beyond basic connection data
* Injection attempts completely failed
* Still could see device types connecting, but nothing beyond that

*I didn't actually do anything malicious or save any personal data* \- this was purely to understand the risks. But it was shocking how easy it would be for someone with bad intentions.

Most surprising finding: in 2025, there are STILL major websites that don't use HTTPS by default. I was able to see full traffic to several news sites, forums, and even some online stores.

The test confirmed what security experts have been saying - public WiFi without protection is basically broadcasting your digital life to anyone who cares to look. And while a VPN isn't perfect protection against everything, it absolutely does shield your browsing from local network snooping.

There’s one piece I ordered and it never showed up, if it does, and I can get it installed, I’ll take another picture. So… I did a lot of scratchbuilding on this, and added some misc. detail. I’ll try to remember it all!

Paint is all Tamiya except for the black craft paint I used on the grille. The cab is TS-11 Maroon, the chassis and body are gloss and semi-gloss black. Interior is TS -90 Brown with the maroon dash. The engine is a custom mix. Grille, wheels and mirrors are TS-26 Pure white, the mirror reflectors are BMF.

The biggest scratch build was the body. I used styrene, basswood and coffee stirrers. The wood was stained with Brown panel liner. I made the reflectors and bed clearance lights from aluminum tubing and red and amber sprue. The trailer hitch is styrene with a plastic headed pin. The hay bales came from HL, and the milk cans from Etsy. I made the creamery and can number decals.

For the interior I added a scratch built turn signal using styrene, craft wire and CA glue.

The engine bay got plug wires, fuel line and heater hose using painted and unpainted solder. The dipstick was made with craft wire.

I drilled the spare wheel before I realized you really couldn’t see it with the hanger on it. All wheels got valves stems made of solder.

I know someone on reddit told me to be ready bc they take a lot more than you think and they were right. My left calf looks deformed, but I’ll take that to cancer any day. 

The surgery itself was easy. The IV in my hand was a little painful, but more gross to look at. Once I got into the operating room, I felt like I was in a sci-fi movie about to get operated on by aliens. And a handsome doctor that looked about my age def saw my butt when I got on the table 😂 embarrassing. Once the drugs were in the next thing I knew I was in the recovery room getting woken up to a nurse asking how I liked my coffee! After about an hour hanging in recovery I was pretty sore so the nurse gave me an oxy before I left the hospital for pain management (thank god- I don’t think is standard). 

NO-ONE WARNED ME ABOUT —- TW: pain / needles 

What no one told me though is HOW FREAKING PAINFUL the injection of the radio tracer for my lymphoscintigraphy would be. I mean - I feel like I should have been out for that or at least had lidocaine? The doctor doing it said it would hurt, but was different for everyone. So I thought okay — Dr saying it will hurt means it’s gunna really effing hurt, but surely I will be the person that is different and doesn’t feel a thing. The first shot wasn’t terrible - it was fine for the first 2 seconds then felt like I was being stabbed with a burning knife for the remaing 5 seconds of the injection… I immediately started silently crying and nearly hyperventilating out of shock… I knew I had 3 more to go. The second was the same and I tried to breathe through it but couldn’t breathe at all. The needle went in, I was fine for a few seconds then it was all of the sudden a burning stabbing knife to my shin bone again. The third one was the absolute worst, I couldn’t breathe, was paralyzed w pain, and tried my best not to scream through my clenched jaw - it was 5 - 10 seconds of the worse pain I’ve experience. I continued to sobbed mute while they did the 4th shot - which weirdly didn’t hurt as bad. 
Did anyone else experience this? I honestly hope I never have to do that again. I will definitely be having nightmares about this fluorescent green liquid. ",3,1742953725.0,Melanoma,5,1.0,False

(My testimony)","Wanted to share something deeply personal. A year ago, I was let go from my job. Today, I thought I was about to be rejected from a role I desperately wanted. What happened next stunned me.

I shared this on r/Christianity as well. It's a major testimony for me and I want to encourage many and give God praise!

I was let go from my job exactly 365 days ago.  
Tossed into a whirlwind of uncertainty. Searching for the next right move.

All was not lost, but things were not going according to plan.  
For context—I’d just had my first child 9 months earlier. Things were supposed to be better. More stable. But in a strange way, I guess they *were* headed in the right direction... I just couldn’t see it yet.

The next three to six months were filled with intentional effort to generate income through my business.  
And I believe there are *tiers of desperation.* Just below an ""urgent"" need lies the first level of desperation. Mine wasn’t quiet or loud—it was *focused.* A desperation with mildly intense execution.

I was meeting people, networking, feverishly pursuing relationships I thought would lead to income. And honestly? It worked. Not fast enough to stay in the city I loved, but I was gaining traction. I drilled down on my vision for my business.

My message was becoming clear: I was a corporate trainer helping organizations foster healthy and productive work environments.  
It resonated. It was *needed.*  
But I didn’t yet have a product to sell.

Now, looking back, I realize: my business *will* work—I just need a well-defined product and process. What I *did* generate this year was a new appreciation for how long it takes to build something meaningful.

Fast forward to **today**: March 25.  
I’ve been in the interview process for a training and development role at a university. It’s been a challenge, full of long silences, uncertainty, and *waiting.*

I’ve been here before—applying for roles, getting ghosted, or receiving that dreaded email:

>

Each one stings. Just when the scab is healing, rejection rips through my confidence and exposes old wounds of inadequacy.

Then I got an email from someone in leadership:  
She wanted to set up a call.  
My gut churned. I *knew* what was coming. A polite call ending my candidacy.

I gave my availability anyway.  
Then spent the next 24 hours with cortisol coursing through my body.

I pulled up ChatGPT and drafted some scripts. If I was going to get rejected, I at least wanted to *represent myself well.*

I went back and forth.

>

Back and forth.  
Fear and faith.  
Hope and preparation.

And then I remembered the *miracles* God had already done:

* My wife’s job, which opened the door for our move
* Our apartment just down the street from family
* The divine timing of every open door

Surely God didn’t go *before* me—only to close this one?

Everything felt perfect. A job in HR. A path into I/O Psychology. Tuition benefits. Health coverage. A future.  
Surely, not now.

And yet, I prepared to be disappointed. I’ve been ""Mr. Entry Level"" most of my career—always waiting to climb a ladder I couldn’t even find.

I went to bed... surprisingly peaceful. I felt like God whispered, *“The news will be good.”* But I still woke up wrestling.

And then something happened.

I looked at the date. **March 25th.**  
My wife and I *joked* a week ago about possibly getting an offer letter on the 25th.

Wait... was I really about to be *rejected* exactly one year to the day after getting laid off?

That’s wild.  
Too wild.  
Surely not.

I walked into a campus coffee shop, laptop in hand. I resolved to swing by the chapel after the call—just to sit with God in the sadness if the news was bad. I’d grieve it, and find peace before finding resilience.

The phone rang.  
I took a deep breath.  
Pulled up my script.  
Airpods in.  
It was time.

A few professional courtesies. Then she said:

>

I was *stunned.*

They weren’t rejecting me. They were **repositioning me for a better fit.**  
They wanted me to give a final presentation—the last step in the process.

No signs of hesitation.  
No polite dismissal.  
They were inviting me to operate in my *biggest strength.*

I finally found my words. I was present again. Fully engaged.  
Asking thoughtful questions. Showing up like a professional.  
Walking in humility... because this last year has broken me in the best ways.

We wrapped the call.  
And I closed with one of my go-to questions:

>

She answered—and I could *feel* the vision.  
All I had to do was walk it out.

When the call ended, I just sat there.  
Relief. Joy. Gratitude.  
Slightly ashamed at my little faith.

God didn’t forget me.  
He didn’t abandon me.  
He’s still *on the throne.*

On the *exact day* I was laid off last year...  
I moved forward in the process for a role perfectly aligned with my calling.

Not rejected.  
*Repositioned.*

To the day, He came through.  
To the day, I saw His kindness.  
To the day, He reminded me I was seen.  
To the day, He gave me purpose.  
To the day, He answered prayers.  
To the day... He was still faithful.

If you’ve read this far, thank you.  
If you’re in your own season of waiting—I see you.  
You’re not forgotten. You’re not done. And you’re not alone.

Hey everyone! I need some advice about a guy I’ve been talking to on a dating app. We’ve been chatting for 2-3 days, and everything was going fine until recently, when his communication suddenly dropped off. We haven’t met yet, but he superliked me and he was already making plans to meet up on day one. I’m wondering if something I did may have made him think I’m catfishing him. 
So, I use a nickname on my profile instead of my full name for privacy reasons— I work in government, and my name is unique enough that people can find me online easily. I’ve had bad experiences with guys adding me on LinkedIn after things ended, so I started using a nickname to avoid that. The guy I’m talking to is a doctor, for some context.
We were talking on the app for a day, and then he suggested we meet for coffee when he’s nearby my town. He asked for my number or Instagram, so I gave him my number. We texted the next day, and the conversation was pretty engaging. Then, I asked him about his hobbies, and after that, I didn’t hear from him again. It’s been 3 days of silence.
I didn’t mention I was using a nickname, but after giving him my number, I searched for him on Facebook using a work account with my legal name and same profile photo on the apps. A couple of days later, his profile popped up in my “People You May Know” section, which makes me think he either saw that I searched for him or found my account and real name after sharing my number.
Now I’m worried he might’ve thought I was hiding something or being deceptive, and I feel kind of guilty about it. I would’ve told him my real name eventually, but it felt a bit too soon, especially since we hadn’t met yet. He has his full name on the app. I have no social media or any online presence with the exception of linkedin (which is private) and the fb account which has nothing in it except 1 profile photo that matches the one on bumble, so aside from the fb account, there wouldnt have been anything else about me online even with my real name.

We had a mutual dislike for a particular person in our grade level, and I fought with him. She never knew that I fought him because of what he did to her (combined with my complete hatred for him). Decades passed, I slid into her DM on a site, and we ended up dating. I ended up telling her about what I did for her in her honor and she kissed me  
  
 She wanted to meet me for lunch two months after we broke up. So, under my best judgment, I said okay and met her.  We had coffee, chatted, etc. As we walked back to my car, she asked me if I could walk her to her car. I tested her and stepped in to kiss her, and she said, ""No.""  I looked at her, took a second thought, and let her walk before me. As soon as she started walking, I doubled back to my car and heard her in the background, calling my name loudly in the parking lot as I drove away. Why walk her back if she wasn't going to be my gf?

She dated a HS friend of mine a few years after we ended it. That didn't last, and I couldn't help but find out from others who still spoke with her that the new guy she dated after the ""friend"" was similar to me. I couldn't help but laugh.

About 12 years passed, and I heard from our similar social circle,"" She misses you. She does have intentions here to be with you romantically, although she seems to accept any form of relationship you could have together, receiving attention from you. Something about how you made her feel that she misses in her life.""

Yes, I still love her very much. I ensured she wasn't the ""what if"" that got away. But we're both in our late 40s, and she's got a kid or two.   I don't have kids and hope to have at least one.

AITAH if I say no to her because she can't give me kids anymore and I refuse to settle?

1jk0hvk,https://i.redd.it/492l4gokuxqe1.jpeg,Worm compost results!,"I just got through sifting my worm compost and thought it would be fun to post the results and some history about this bin.  This is my first time keeping worms.  

I received 750 red wiggler worms on 1/24/24 from Uncle Jim’s.  I placed them inside a large tote in my basement.  I had wet cardboard as the base along with a little soil from my yard to give them some grit.  

I added food scraps over the last 14 months.  Just a little at first but now I do it weekly and they have been keeping up.  Weekly food scraps they get are:  The week’s used coffee grounds and filters - usually we have a pot of coffee per day.  All the banana peels and strawberry tops that we toss out which is normally three or four banana peels and the tops from a pint of strawberries.  I usually add one egg carton with the egg shells left in it too.  Avocado skins and pits and if any produce spoils I drop that in too.  The majority of our food scraps still go into our compost bin and not to the worms.

I sifted today, 3/25/25, and got about 2.5 gallons of nice fine worm castings.  I also got another 2 to 3 gallons that I did not sift and just dumped on my garden compost pile.  This was the worm castings left in the last 6 inches at the bottom of the tote.  I keep my worm tote inside another plastic tote to hold any water that leaks from the first tote so these worm castings were just a little too damp to sift.  Not many worms in this layer to sift out since it was finished castings.  They did not seem to be too active in this layer anymore.  

As for the worms that I sifted out I had about 7 gallons of compost material that was not all the way broken down and all the worms that were mixed in with them. No estimate on how many worms but a lot :).  I was very happy with the amount of worms.  Had all sizes down to teeny tiny and had some casings as well.  I put this 7 or so gallons of material and worms back into my tote to use as the base for future composting.  I put this week’s new food scraps on top.  

Everything went pretty well.  I kept it too wet and added too many food scraps at first.  Some smell but I reduced the amount of scraps, added cardboard more than food scraps and it fixed itself over time.  I have some tiny mites that like the banana peels and the avocado scraps but they aren’t too bad.  I get tiny little centipedes as well.  Mostly worms though.  One time slim mold sprouted through the air holes and covered the top but I cleaned it up and that has not happened again.  While I was sifting I found lots of the large half egg shells left over.  These were stuffed full of worm compost with a cluster of worms in each.  Seems like they liked the egg shells to stay in.  Kind of like a bunch of worm condos.  :)

I had fun doing it and will continue to do so.  Hope you enjoyed hearing about my worms.  Good luck everyone.",11,1742953150.0,Vermiculture,0,1.0,False

Weather: I went in March. It only rained for a few minutes on one day. The rest of the time was sunny. However, I believe it rained everyday the previous week. 

Check-in: Staff is waiting at airport with leis and an escort via boat to the hotel. At the reception, they give juice and tiare scented cold towels. For my lowly gold status, I was upgraded from a lagoon view bungalow to an island view bungalow (I think they are prioritizing cash paying customers for the mountain view bungalows). I came in the morning and my room was available. 

Location: The hotel’s location is gorgeous. They do need to rehabilitate their coral. I believe they are still doing construction on some of the villas, but I didn’t personally notice any construction work/noise outright. 

Room: My bungalow ended up being on the end where I had both mountain and island views. Mountain views are better for sunsets and island views are better for sunrises. If I was choosing a bungalow, I would actually choose an island view, because I prefer watching the sunrise in my room over the sunset. Also, the terraces on the bungalows only provide visual privacy from your nearest neighbors. There were a couple of couples who gathered at a bungalow at sunset to drink. They were loud and ruined any chance of relaxing on the terrace at sunset. It was always quiet in the morning on the terrace. The coffee in the room needs improvement especially as compared to the coffee they serve at breakfast (fresh milk as compared to powdered). The only other complaint about the room is the bathtub. I’m a bath girlie and the bath is not comfortable. Also, oddly, while the shower had plentiful hot water, I could only fill the bathtub 1/2 up without ending up with lukewarm water. I am still confused about that. Overall, I was happy with the room/facilities in the room. 

Food: The food is hit or miss (I appreciate a wide variety of foods/flavors, but can be critical if they’re not executed well). The breakfast buffet (you can also order a la carte) has some excellent items (poisson cru, mango, chocolate croissants, polynesian rice, polynesian poe (banana pudding soaked in coconut milk)), but the pancakes and crepes were dense/gummy and inedible. Overall, a lot of the traditional american/french items are poorly executed (ie the eggs benedict’s hollandaise was made from a powder and the bread was too soggy). For lunch/dinner, the grilled moon fish was great, but the steamed vegetables (taro, plantains, et c) were terrible (dry and flavorless). I was actually surprised as the polynesian items were the best at breakfast, but this side was not good. The shrimp roll was enjoyable. Maere should’ve been a skip for me. There were excellent dishes (tuna tartar and the desserts), but the majority were subpar. One dish was awful and should’ve never been on the menu.


Service: Overall, I think most of the service workers are trying their best and want the guests happy, however one of the male french waiters literally scoffed at me when I didn’t want to order alcohol at dinner. (The resort promotes alcohol (pool bar, frozen drinks, complimentary champagne bottle in your room, extensive drink menus, and tastings) so something to keep in mind if you abstain from alcohol.) He was also the only waiter who offered water as sparkling or still and tried to omit offering tap (is he paid a commission on charging for $10 bottles of water?) I cringed when I got him a second night as a waiter. Housekeeping kept my room clean. No 
items were stolen. Overall, the polynesian staff were friendlier and more welcoming than the french staff. 

Transport to the main island: This was the most disappointing aspect of the property. The shuttle boat is a noticeable step down from the boat that picks guests up from the airport. They don’t drop you off in town or offer a complimentary shuttle like other resorts in the area. Your options are a $60-70 taxi or $100+ rental. They charge for dinner pick ups to discourage dining away from the resort. I do not agree with this strategy especially when you’re already charging a $500 resort fee. Improve your food so your restaurants are desirable, arrange a complimentary shuttle to the main town for guests who don’t want to drive, or negotiate a better dock drop off for your guests (ie main town or public beaches). Realistically, people want to rent a car one day, but would like to be dropped off for a few hours at the popular spots during the course of their stay.  It was shocking having stayed at hotels like hotel 1 hanalei bay where they offer complimentary audis to accommodate guests or four seasons lanai offers free charter flights and shuttles to this setup.

Spa: I did get a massage at the spa and the only complaint I can lodge is the fragrances in the steam room. They serve you a delicious hibiscus tea with another tiare scented hand towel while you pick out your massage oil. Then you can use the spa facilities while you wait for appointment. I went in the morning and had the facility to myself. The massage was excellent. They offer you a chocolate after your massage. They didn’t hard sell the spa products, which I appreciated. After your massage, you can utilize the facilities for the entire day. 

Activities: The rum tasting was the most worthwhile activity and I actually purchased a bottle at duty-free on the way home. They don’t offer the rums for sale, which I think is a missed opportunity. The wine tasting had some terrible french wines on the day I went (I generally enjoy french wines so I do not know what was up with that). I was disappointed they didn’t have any tahitian wines at the tasting. The yoga classes were weird vs being typical yoga classes. The exercise classes were not consistently scheduled. I missed most of the cultural activities so I can’t comment on those. The paddle boards and kayaks are on the lower quality side, but easily accessible. The bikes were clearly rehabilitated and need additional maintenance (handles missing and I came across a few broken bikes). They need to purchase more to accommodate all the guests. The view from the pool is gorgeous. Pool was well stocked with sunscreen and towels. The cabanas are comfortable. 

Final thoughts: Throughout my review, I highlighted several spots for improvements, but my overall impression was it was a beautiful resort. I honestly think the hotel should position itself as a wellness destination similar to hotel 1 hanalei vs another honeymoon destination. I don’t think they’re outcompeting the other resorts in the area and do think they need to differentiate themselves. I think there’s a lot of promise for this property, but there’s a lot they still need to tweak a few things to get me to spend cash or points vs booking at the neighboring properties. 

TLDR: If you can score a good redemption, I’d book it. However, if you’re paying cash, I’d book elsewhere.

My friend Adriana (35f) is an intelligent, gorgeous Puerto Rican woman who worked her butt off to develop an app that she was able to sell a few years ago and made a ton of money. She bought an apartment in a brand-new luxury building where she was one of the first tenants. Moving in on the same day was Susan (45f). She lived two apartments over, worked in tech, and was single as well. The two hit it off and became friends.

During a visit, Adriana’s older brother, Angel, met Susan and fell madly in love with her. Susan luckily felt the love too and Angel moved to the city so they could live together, they bought a little weekend cabin in the mountains, and they eventually got engaged.

During the wedding planning, Susan’s idiosyncrasies came out and while she was not bridezilla like we see on this subreddit, she was a bit of a challenge to deal with. But hey, weddings are stressful. Adriana, our friend Trisha, and I would offer to help and did a lot of work and planning.

Here is where things start to get weird... Adriana would ask if they had a location picked yet as they wanted something in the mountains and there are not a lot of hotels in some of those towns. We needed to make sure we had enough room for people to stay as her family is coming from Wisconsin and his from Puerto Rico.  Susan kept dodging the question.  It wasn’t until the wedding invitation boxes came in (for Adriana and me to address and mail out BTW) that we saw the location. Adriana did a Google search and found the town had one hotel and so called them up to get a block of rooms. Susan had already called the hotel and had already reserved the whole thing including already assigning the rooms out.

Adriana and I were skeptical. Invites hadn’t even been sent yet so how can she have assigned the rooms. We walked over to her apartment to talk to her, and she admitted that she did have the WHOLE hotel booked... for her family. She wanted to make sure they had a place so took every room. When asked where Angel’s family is supposed to stay, she recommended we start looking at Airbnbs!

After a bunch of research, we found a few but between the cost to travel, the transportation to the mountains from the city, and then the Airbnbs (which were about 25 minutes from the venue), the other members of Angel and Adriana’s family decided they didn’t want to come. So it ended up just being Adriana, her mom, her aunt, Trish and myself (although I then had to drop out, but did still pay my part as I felt so bad for them).  Just to give you a headcount... Angel gets 5 people for his side (4 after I had to bow out) and Susan got 246 people!

I should also point out that Angel did not get any groomsmen, but Susan had 10 bridesmaids!

The rest of the wedding prep went okay so I’m going to jump to the rehearsal dinner: Susan’s family treated it like a family reunion with different types of party games, a bunch of speeches, and throughout it all, they wouldn’t let Adriana, her family, or Trisha participate. They let Angel participate some but if Adrianna tried to do a game, join the conversation, or even GET FOOD, they were like “Oh, you know this is a family thing right?”.  Finally, Trisha got the car, and they went back to the Airbnb and the four of them ordered some DoorDash.

Day of the Wedding: Adriana woke up to, no joke, 20 missed calls and just under 50 text messages from Susan. She was freaking out because Adriana didn’t arrive at the venue at 6am to get things setup. No one asked Adriana to do any setup and definitely didn’t mention anything about 6am! When she called Susan to ask what she meant, Susan said “Well, when you are the help, you should know better” !!!!

Trisha was kind enough to head over to the venue and deal with the crazed Susan so she went giving Adriana and her mom had time to get properly ready for the wedding. At the venue, Trisha says she was treated horribly. Her exact words were “like a slave.” She said the way these white people bossed her around and then demeaned her when it wasn’t perfect, was ridiculous. About two hours in, one of them even said “Susan should have had a plantation wedding with the family she is marrying into!” (NOTE: Trisha is a Black woman).  Trisha literally said, “Fuck you” and left. She went back to the Airbnb and told the rest.

It was an hour before the wedding and Trisha had said she was not going anymore. She made a DoorDash order for a lot of alcohol instead, and I’m in full agreement with her! Adriana’s mom and aunt really wanted to go so Adriana agreed to go and the three drove over.

The ceremony itself was fine. But at the reception... they were assigned a CARD TABLE in the back of the room right in front of the door to the kitchen! This was a VERY nice venue with nice tables, no one else had a small four-person card table. It was also discussed that Angel and Adriana’s mom would do a toast/speech since he didn’t have a best man. However, at the start of the reception, one of the bridesmaids told them that there would be no speeches. BUT THEN... the maid of honor and father of the groom gave a speech. When Adriana got up to ask about her mom’s speech, Susan was like “Oh, the schedule says it is dancing time, so we don’t have time for that.” They couldn’t believe what was happening and anytime they tried to get to Angel, he would disappear, and they couldn’t find him. Finally, they just left, and on the way back to the Airbnb her mom was quietly crying in the backseat.

The next day, Adriana text her brother asking WTF happened and he said that the wedding day is about the bride, and they need to respect Susan’s wishes. Adriana said she understood the bride is the center of attention, but the treatment of their mom was crazy. Until he apologized, they would not be talking to him. He just replied, “Susan says have a good life” WTH!!!!!!

Well... for the last two weeks it has been awkward for sure at the apartment building. I mean, they live two doors down. Every time Adriana sees her brother in the hall or elevator she just says, “You need to apologize to mom” and nothing else. And if Susan is in the hall or elevator, she just stares at her hard but saying nothing.

Today: Adriana saw her brother in the elevator after getting a coffee and said her usual “You need to apologize to mom” and he lost it and started yelling at Adriana that SHE was the racist one because she didn’t understand Susan’s culture. (Like it just seems flat out racist so don’t blame Wisconsin culture for that!) He then said, “it is unfair you are treating us like we did something wrong. We just wanted to make sure the other guests were comfortable.”  Adriana threw her coffee on him (like the queen she is!) and got off the elevator, went into her apartment and slammed the door HARD.

I have hung out with Susan plenty of times and never really cause racist type vibes from her at all, so I’m sure she was doing that because of her family, but it doesn’t make it right. And I can only imagine Angel is going along with this because Susan has a lot of money, and he has grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle. I just hope one day he apologizes to his mom (and his sister, and his aunt, and Trisha), but even if he does, I still think I’m going to throw a coffee on him if I see him in her building!",9,1742952780.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

Tossed into a whirlwind of uncertainty. Searching for the next right move.

All was not lost, but things were not going according to plan.  
For context, I’d just had my first child 9 months earlier. Things were supposed to be better. More stable. But in a strange way, I guess they *were* headed in the right direction... I just couldn’t see it yet.

The next three to six months were filled with intentional effort to generate income through my business.  
And I believe there are *tiers of desperation.* Just below an ""urgent"" need lies the first level of desperation. Mine wasn’t quiet or loud—it was *focused.* A desperation with mildly intense execution.

I was meeting people, networking, feverishly pursuing relationships I thought would lead to income. And honestly? It worked. Not fast enough to stay in the city I loved, but I was gaining traction. I drilled down on my vision for my business.

My message was becoming clear: I was a corporate trainer helping organizations foster healthy and productive work environments.  
It resonated. It was *needed.*  
But I didn’t yet have a product to sell.

Now, looking back, I realize: my business *will* work—I just need a well-defined product and process. What I *did* generate this year was a new appreciation for how long it takes to build something meaningful.

Fast forward to **today**: March 25.  
I’ve been in the interview process for a training and development role at a university. It’s been a challenge, full of long silences, uncertainty, and *waiting.*

I’ve been here before—applying for roles, getting ghosted, or receiving that dreaded email:

>

Each one stings. Just when the scab is healing, rejection rips through my confidence and exposes old wounds of inadequacy.

Then I got an email from someone in leadership:  
She wanted to set up a call.  
My gut churned. I *knew* what was coming. A polite call ending my candidacy.

I gave my availability anyway.  
Then spent the next 24 hours with cortisol coursing through my body.

I pulled up ChatGPT and drafted some scripts. If I was going to get rejected, I at least wanted to *represent myself well.*

I went back and forth.

>

Back and forth.  
Fear and faith.  
Hope and preparation.

And then I remembered the *miracles* God had already done:

* My wife’s job, which opened the door for our move
* Our apartment just down the street from family
* The divine timing of every open door

Surely God didn’t go *before* me—only to close this one?

Everything felt perfect. A job in HR. A path into I/O Psychology. Tuition benefits. Health coverage. A future.  
Surely, not now.

And yet, I prepared to be disappointed. I’ve been ""Mr. Entry Level"" most of my career—always waiting to climb a ladder I couldn’t even find.

I went to bed... surprisingly peaceful. I felt like God whispered, *“The news will be good.”* But I still woke up wrestling.

And then something happened.

I looked at the date. **March 25th.**  
My wife and I *joked* a week ago about possibly getting an offer letter on the 25th.

Wait... was I really about to be *rejected* exactly one year to the day after getting laid off?

That’s wild.  
Too wild.  
Surely not.

I walked into a campus coffee shop, laptop in hand. I resolved to swing by the chapel after the call—just to sit with God in the sadness if the news was bad. I’d grieve it, and find peace before finding resilience.

The phone rang.  
I took a deep breath.  
Pulled up my script.  
Airpods in.  
It was time.

A few professional courtesies. Then she said:

>

I was *stunned.*

They weren’t rejecting me. They were **repositioning me for a better fit.**  
They wanted me to give a final presentation—the last step in the process.

No signs of hesitation.  
No polite dismissal.  
They were inviting me to operate in my *biggest strength.*

I finally found my words. I was present again. Fully engaged.  
Asking thoughtful questions. Showing up like a professional.  
Walking in humility... because this last year has broken me in the best ways.

We wrapped the call.  
And I closed with one of my go-to questions:

>

She answered—and I could *feel* the vision.  
All I had to do was walk it out.

When the call ended, I just sat there.  
Relief. Joy. Gratitude.  
Slightly ashamed at my little faith.

God didn’t forget me.  
He didn’t abandon me.  
He’s still *on the throne.*

On the *exact day* I was laid off last year...  
I moved forward in the process for a role perfectly aligned with my calling.

Not rejected.  
*Repositioned.*

To the day, He came through.  
To the day, I saw His kindness.  
To the day, He reminded me I was seen.  
To the day, He gave me purpose.  
To the day, He answered prayers.  
To the day... He was still faithful.

If you’ve read this far, thank you.  
If you’re in your own season of waiting—I see you.  
You’re not forgotten. You’re not done. And you’re not alone.

**Kathy Evenson, Very Exhausted Professional**

*Somewhere outside the Badlands, in the Seventh World*

""Nevin!"" Kells cried. ""Dunnes!""

Kathy floated up, levitating in order to get a better view. She rose above the remaining trees and scanned around, letting her eyes slip into a spectrum that could see the faint, sparkling trails of magic left by the activity in the canyon.

She peered around for a long moment, but saw nothing except the destruction wrought by her supercharged Ma Deuce. If there were any blood trails or tracks to be seen, they were gone now. The magic sparkling added nothing to the tale, most of it obscured behind the glittering trails still remaining from the enchanted gunfire.

She lowered herself to the ground as Willis began to mutter to himself, making focusing gestures with both hands.

Kathy watched, the nerdy part of her mind intrigued by the display of local magic. It reminded her a bit of what she'd always imagined a wizard in Dungeons & Dragons looked like. Willis contorted his fingers into a series of poses, very similar to American Sign Language, though her limited understanding of it did not make any sense of the shapes. At the same time, he swept both hands up and down, almost as if guiding smoke from an incense bundle, though there was no smoke for him to work with.

His mutterings had the familiar, slippery and jangly feeling of verbal focii. They seemed to slip into her ears and then go sliding out before her brain could fully process them. By the time he spoke each syllable, she could not have told you what the last syllable had been.

Kathy knew of some wizards who used them, though she had never had any particular need for them, herself. For her, merely visualizing the shape of the energies was enough. But, she knew, for many who were not demigods, they needed an aid to work with denser energies. By imbuing trace amounts of magic into the words themselves, they could use them to shape more powerful energies.

""What's he doing?"" she asked Kells as the lanky man walked up to stand next to her.

""Each o' us has a grain o' rice we got from 'im,"" Kells explained. ""Cut open the backsa our arms and stuck 'em in, used a bit o' magic t'heal the scar. He can work some spell that'll let 'im get a bearin' an' distance on Nevin an' Dunnes' grains.""

Kathy nodded. She was already working out how that magic might look. Jerry and her had discussed something similar for the gang, but never seriously. The simple fact was that all of them knew each other well enough and were distinct enough from the rest of humanity as to not need any enchanted aids in using any tracking magic. And tracking magic had a limited range, in any event. What with all the gallivanting around the planet and across the very planes of existence they did, no amount of magical rice would make tracking each other possible, most of the time.

She watched him go for a few moments before he finally went quiet, then slowly raised one arm, fingers tight together and pointed out in a classic knife-hand. He turned slowly, keeping his eyes closed, until he finally seemed satisfied.

""Six thousand yards,"" he said, seemingly out of breath.

""Sheeit,"" Kells cursed. Kathy turned to follow the direction Willis was gesturing in, only to realize that he was pointing behind them. A little mental math converted his answer.

""Three and a half miles back that way puts them back in the badlands,"" she said.

""Ayup,"" Kells agreed.

Fluffs turned from helping Jors bandage his arm. ""We gotta go back?""

""Unless yer plannin' on abandonin' Dunnes an' Nevin,"" Kells said defeatedly.

""Not Dunnes,"" Jors opined. ""*Maybe* Nevin.""

""Definitely Nevin,"" Brellin agreed. The two shared a smirk. Kathy made a point of not allowing any expression to cross her face. Nevin had rubbed her the wrong way, early on. His doubts about her stories had irked her. And he'd been standoff-ish since they had begun their journey, as well. But Kells had always treated the man just like the others, so she had held her tongue.

""Ye two are far too optimistic on yer own,"" Kells snapped at them. ""Ye'd find yerselves dead from trustin' some trollop or broke from buyin' bridges off itinerant salesmen without Nevin around t'keep ye honest.""

""You'd definitely die to the trollop,"" Jors told Brellin, who seemed ready to argue, then struck a pensive expression for a second before issuing a resigned shrug.

""I don't wanna go back there,"" Fluffs said. ""But if we gotta, I wanna go now and get it over with.""

""Aye, big man,"" Kells agreed. He heaved a deep sigh and took a look around at the carnage surrounding them.

""Let's get a move on.""

**Ava ""Nightingale"", Former Avatar, Goddess, Freedom Fighter, Current Librarian**

It had taken a bit to figure out who Carl really was. The English or Scandinavian name was her first clue. The presence of his wife, an insanely beautiful trans woman, had been the next. 

Unfortunately, Ava did not have all of Sarisa's memories, nor all of her power (the whispers she sometimes heard were unpredictable, a mere echo of what had been a full divinity), so while those clues has rested uneasy in her mind, they had not been enough. No, what had finally cinched it was what Carl began to do when she finally relented and let him have a look at Godslayer.

He began to duplicate it. That had narrowed the possibilities down to one. One she was about to test, as she walked into the small workshop, located in the back of an artificery downtown. She put down one of the three coffees in the cup carrier next to where Carl was currently hunched over a small down feather, carefully drawing runes on it with a tiny paintrbrush he periodically dipped into what appeared to be clear water. It took a moment for the smell to break his focus.

He glanced up, then smiled warmly at Ava. ""Thank you very much, dear,"" he said, popping the lid off the cup and taking an experimental sip.

""This is good!"" he marveled, the same way he'd done with every single variant of coffee she'd brought him over the past few days.

""So when did you stop calling yourself Krall?"" Ava asked, conversationally.

""Who's Krall?"" Carl asked without missing a beat. He turned back to his work, dipping his brush back in the water and tracing more tiny sigils into the feather. His reaction was a perfect mask of innocence, but she could hear a hint of divine magic in that moment, whispering in her ear.

*He's lying.*

""Oh, just someone I used to know,"" Ava drawled, taking a small chair from the corner and plopping it down where she could watch him work.

Carl chuckled. ""I'm pretty sure you didn't know me before we met in the club,"" he said. ""And I've always been Carl.""

*He's telling the truth... Technically.* An image of Ashley appeared along with the voice, then changed to become Anah, speaking to a reporter. ""I've always been Anah,"" she said. ""I just didn't know it until I was seven.""

""I believe that. But you used to be Krall,"" Ava insisted.

""You knew this Krall, huh?"" Carl put his brush down and lifted up the feather, turning it and examining it in the light. Nodding in satisfaction at his work, he placed the feather into a small dish and then lit a match from a box of them and dropped it in.

The feather ignited, burning with rainbow-colored flames. The licks of fire were tiny, sharp, almost as if he had lit a bonfire in miniature. Ava watched the smoke from the burning feather float up, coalescing into a small ball.

""Sort of,"" she said. ""What are you doing?""

""Collecting some of the energies I'm going to need,"" he said. ""The magic of this artifact is... Well, it's probably in the top five most complicated enchantments in the history of magic. I have to work magic to work the magic I need to work the magic to *make* the enchantment on the blade.""

""It's like a spell-ception,"" Ava deadpanned. Carl chuckled, only confirming her knowledge. That was a reference to an old movie from the Seventeenth world. The world where Krall and Asritee had lived as humans for millennia, rather than slumbering with the other gods.

""It's very complicated, yeah..."" Carl said. He waved a hand over the globe of smoke and it began to shrink and thicken, until after a few seconds, a small ball fell out of the air and bounced on the table. Carl slapped a hand down on it.

""And that's actually the last bit of prep work,"" he announced. He turned, grabbing his coffee and favoring Ava with another patronly smile before taking a long drink and heaving a satisfied sigh.

""So you're ready to put it together?"" Ava asked, surprised. She realized that she shouldn't be. She could tell that Carl was no longer a god, but he would have had tens of thousands of years of experience and still be a demigod of his old domains. If anyone could reproduce Jerry's work, it would be him.

""What are those?"" Ava asked. 

""I need a sword, obviously. Preferably, it should be hand-made by either a god, a demigod, or the servant of a living god.""

Ava nodded. This was not surprising. ""It'll need to be a masterpiece,"" she said. Carl nodded back. ""Yes, absolutely.""

""And what's the other thing you need?""

""Well,"" Carl drew out the word. His eyes darted around the room once, then returned to meet Ava's. She could sense a change in his demeanor. He was more serious now. His eyes betrayed skepticism, worry and doubt.

""What is it?"" Ava asked, growing a knot of concern of her own.

""Well, I need..."" Carl sighed. He closed his eyes for a moment, then met her gaze again.

""I need the soul of a god.""

Ava blinked in surprise.

As we with Parkinson’s know. Results may vary. At times I couldn’t feel the difference, but other times I felt down right normal!  This would last a few hours, then it would wear off.. quickly. He warned me I would be peeing orange but failed to mention other side effects.
Well, it’s taken a while, but I started feeling pain in my middle finger knuckle in my right hand.  Later came pain in my left shoulder and elbow. I wasn’t sure if this was some new symptom or what. At this point, however, the pain was interfering with my exercising. I couldn’t lift the weight I used to. I couldn’t hold a coffee cup.
On a hunch, I looked up side effects of Entacapone. Joint pain was listed, so I stopped taking it and seem to be improving.
This, of course, puts me back to where I was before seeing the Dr. my first prescription was Carbidopa 25/Levodopa 100 (I think) 3 times daily, so it’s gone up over time. Apparently, he’s hesitant to increase the dosage. How high a dose have you all seen before it stopped working?
It seems we need to keep track of changes in our routines in case that difference is causing some ill effect. In this case, it was a medication, but I suppose it could easily have been a change of diet or sleeping habit.

I am not novice to gym, diet and everything but from 6 months I started to take care of myself for the first time without a coach/personal trainer/nutrition expert.

I am a male, 70 kg (154 lbs) x 162cm (5.3' ft).

I am probably a skinny fat since my body fat is 25% ish.

I am following a calorie deficit of 500 calories ish.

I eat 1460 kcal on rest days and 2140 kcal on gym days.

I give myself an off diet day once a week where I can eat max 2100kcal of whatever I want, always trying to reach my protein intake (150gr of protein).

On my rest days my macros are 115 carbs / 160 prot / 40 fat  /// Gym days 195 / 210 / 58

I do take isolate whey protein and creatine everyday, both mostly after workout also, coffee and one banana pre-work out.

I work out every other day (so one week 3 times, other week 4 times).

My split is the following:

1st day - Chest / Triceps / Abs / 200kcal calories cardio at 150/160 bpm

2ndst day - Back / Biceps / Abs / 200kcal calories cardio at 150/160 bpm

3rd day - Legs / Shoulders and biceps\* / Abs / 200kcal calories cardio at 150/160 bpm

\*I train biceps more because it is my favorite muscle.

During this split I train each big muscle with 14 sets ish, “secondary” muscles (such as biceps/triceps/shoulders) with 8-9 sets.

I train mostly to failure (RPE 8) with rest time between 60 and 90 seconds.

My expenditure per workout is on an average of 450kcal (1h30m of workout) + 200kcal of cardio.

The next months I will try to take my weekly trainings from 3 to 4.

Am I doing everything okay? Am I on a good path?

At the beginning I was 73kg ish, for sure I lost fat but now it seems I am stuck on 70kg, I see more muscle though and weights are increasing every 2 weeks.

I would like to lose more fat.

Any thoughts? Thanks to everyone :)",0,1742951425.0,CICO,0,0.5,False

Our family live in my city so at Christmas time, my sister and her husband usually alternate and will spend one Christmas with his family where they live now, and the next year they will come down here. 

My husband and I own a three bedroom house with no kids. The house is like a small cottage style home, one bathroom, one living area, so it isn’t overly big. We also have two 100lb dogs that live inside. They cannot sleep outside because they will bark and wake up the neighbours so they sleep inside. 

Last time my sister came down for Christmas (in 2023) I let her stay with me. At the time, she had a 1.5 year old toddler and my husband and I were quite disappointed with how much he trashed our house. He was sitting on our brand new lounge and peed through his nappy and left a big urine stain, he scratched our handmade timber slab coffee table all over to the point we had to sand it back and restain it, and he crushed up the bars of soap in the bathroom and left it all over the bathroom floor for us to clean after they left. Needless to say we were quite upset. My sister was just like oh well that’s what toddlers do. I found it extremely disrespectful to come into somebody else’s home and damage their property and act like it’s normal and to be expected. We also had to pay for our lounge to be professionally cleaned. 

So this year my sister is due to come home again for Christmas. I am currently pregnant with our first child that is due in October. My sister has also since had another kid so come Christmas her kids will be 3.5 and 1.5. She asked if she could come stay with us and I said no because our house is only 3 bedroom, we will have a newborn and there isn’t enough room for 2 adults and 2 toddlers to come stay here. I explained there isn’t enough room and she said they can put a blow up bed in the loungeroom and then take the one spare bed so they would have two queen beds with one adult and one kid in each. I told her my dogs sleep in the loungeroom and that it probably isn’t safe to have a small kid sleeping next to them. They are 100lb boerboels bred for guarding and should their kid crawl out of bed in the middle of the night and touch one of them, the dog would be startled and their instincts would be to jump up quickly and bark with the intention to intimidate. As a responsible large dog owner it would not be safe to put the child nor my dogs in that situation. My sister said to just put the dogs outside, which as I mentioned earlier I cannot do because they will bark and keep the neighbours awake. Not to mention it would keep us awake while we are already sleep deprived in the newborn trenches. Plus the idea of having her two toddlers come into our house and trash it like the older one did last time is just stressing me out. My sister thinks I’m being unreasonable.

1jjztun,https://www.reddit.com/r/ebf/comments/1jjztun/is_the_ebf_canon_confusing_me/,Is the EBF canon confusing me?,"Well, I like this game, but I have to admit that there are some things that are not clear to me in the EBF canon, and I guess Matt did it on purpose because the truth is that the EBF story does not take itself too seriously. But my first question is if Bullet Heaven 2 and Brawl Royale are canon? Braw Royal is not very consistent with the continuity of EBF to be a prequel, but it does have details to say that they are, the most obvious is that Roku has the wound that Matt gave him in Brawl Royale, in fact it looks much worse than in Brawl Royale and about Bullet Heaven 2 it seems to be the one that has continuity with the main games although I'm not sure about that, in that case they were not canon, EBF by itself works and the same would happen with the videos that Matt has on YouTube, but there is another thing that would be considered a plot error (I think). Like the claim that Godcat created Akron to destroy humanity, though ironically Akron forgot his purpose as implied. How is Akron supposed to be a gift to humanity if he allegedly existed long before humanity ever existed? I mean, I don't know if what I'm saying is a misinterpretation on my part, but did Godcat already know that cats were going to let humans take over the world or not? When she was thinking of creating them, did she already have that distrust towards them that she decided to create Akron just in case? And if she knew, couldn't she have avoided it? She hasn't shown that she is omniscient or that she sees the future or that she has control of destiny, so that possibility doesn't seem likely to me. I don't know, it's something I don't understand, but I guess it can be explained thanks to the fact that ""The Devourer"", thanks to his claim of having restarted the simulation 5 times, could have changed Akron's origin story. And now talking about the most discussed here, is Godcat or The Devourer stronger? thanks to the fact that she didn't die but showed mercy and surrendered and The Devourer although technically didn't die (and I don't think he could in a conventional way), lost much more than Godcat, here I don't have much to say, I think that the Devourer is stronger than Godcat and that the incarnation of the playable characters are stronger than those in previous games, and that we the player also gave them the necessary power to defeat him. And finally, since it's a game that breaks the fourth wall a lot, nobody knows if it's canon or not, I don't think everything they say is really canon, I mean, they claim they can talk without the need for text boxes and that coffee can apparently revive people if it's strong enough and that the cats that we thought were just an art style to represent cats, turned out to canonically not have legs, that as an example, so we could say that RPG style fights aren't really like that although I would be speculating more than anything, so we could say that many of the mechanics are canon and others are not, and it doesn't necessarily apply to their entire world, text boxes for example are more for us than for them.",3,1742951180.0,ebf,1,0.81,False

I might be inclined to agree with that.

Something I have a peripheral awareness of is the idea of ""Making a claim"".

You know what I mean - coffee cups have a warning on them ""Caution - Hot Contents"". 

Apparently this was not always the case. Someone scalded themselves, and made claim.

Whether they were feigning ignorance or not - maybe they had a point.

The term ""Miscarriage of justice"" encapsulates the idea - but it's a bit of a loaded term.

If the term was ""Natural consequence of a less-than-perfect attempt at justice"" then such outcomes would be expected.

But that isn't what the term is. 

There's plenty of annoying cunts making content where they ""police the police"". 

I suppose that's all well and good - but when a real emergency arrives, I won't be calling a ""sovereign citizen"" to my aid. 

There's lots of reason why I wouldn't. For a start - I don't know their phone number.

Someone, somewhere - is obligated to answer the call when you are genuinely fucked.

In the UK we have Osman warnings - a friendly heads up from the powers that be that your life is in danger. Isn't that nice?

As I write, I hear an echo from one of my highschool teachers - ""Keep it simple, stupid - KISS"".

Point taken - what am I actually trying to say?

I guess what I'm trying to say is that many of the institutions that exist to ""serve"" were founded with that intention in mind. Genuinely - that's why they exist in the first place.  
  
Government, universities, tax collectors, law enforcement, healthcare, educators - you name it.

I was born in the information age. That's something that was impressed upon me - not something I decided for myself.

Something that I did decide for myself, was taking notice of the fact that these institutions seem to be directed - in general - by people born in the fucking stone age.

Look at the UK - and look at the United States.

Ironically the US constitution separates church and sate - but when was the last time a president shied away from saying ""God bless America"".

On the other hand, in the UK, if a prospective candidate declared that they believed in God - they would likely get laughed out of the polls.

And yet, in the UK, the house of lords has 26 seats reserved especially for bishops and archbishops.

And the house of lords is not made up of elected officials - their seats are reserved and appointed.

A question of great wisdom springs to mind:

Who the fuck is paying for this?

If, like me, you live the UK - **you are**.

If you don't live the UK (or if indeed, like me, you evade tax) - maybe you aren't contributing to it directly.

What you see around you on a daily basis - [is democracy manifest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFgcqB8-AxE). 

When Oxford was built - we didn't have the internet. But it exists today.

Before capitalism - there were no roads. But roads exist today.  
  
When you see some dinosaur or another standing in the houses of parliament - gleefully referencing ""tech bros"" as if they have a fucking clue of the cultural landscape - surely you question ""**What are you for?**"".

All they plan to do - all they ever plan to do - is to introduce austerity. Laughing all the way to the bank. while they do it. Invariably.

We still vote with paper and pencil - in the motherfucking information age. What a fucking joke. 

What are the consequences of being complicit? Shite. What are the consequences of not being complicit? equally shite. 

It's a double bind. It's a lack of choice. It's the complete opposite of freedom. 

I have literally nothing to offer you in the way of alternatives - but I will say this:

I am not an imposter. I don't want your vote - I don't need your money.

Any cunt that stands on a pulpit claiming that they are fit to lead you - is a fucking liar. They want your compliance as much as they need your money.

Those who represent us on a daily basis - worldwide - are the grand imposters. (Zelenskyy and the like notwithstanding). 

Political disenchantment is the default. Your vote doesn't matter - and nothing changes.

I eventually found a friend in HS because she was also in a rough situation and facing tuerncy. So I showed up at her door every morning and drug her to school, eventually she grew to like me and now we are the closest thing to family each other have had. Time passed, I did a shit ton of therapy, moved states and learned how to function as a productive member of society. But I still can't make friends. I've lived here 3yrs and still have no one I can go get coffee with or just text even. I enrolled in trade school and thought things would change for me since I was now for the first time surrounded by potential friends (I had tried with various co-workers but actual friendship never came). I've tried with practically everyone to have casual conversations and try to create some frequency in engaging, hoping it'll lead to them wanting to talk to me first but I'm always the first one to engage conversation. I go out of my way to complement my classmates work (I'm in Cosmo so by out of my way I just mean wade through the maze of students/clients and stations to tell them I love the color they did or that cut was well executed). Recently while talking to a friend group I've been trying to join one of them said ""we know you like your personal time, but we all think you're really cool. You should sit with us more"". I was confused and obviously agreed to sit with them more especially for lunch, but I am really confused why they have that impression. Has everyone had this impression my whole life?

In a way I’m embarassed that it took me so long to figure out caffeine was destroying my life but it’s also amazing that I found out.
BEFORE CUTTING CAFFEINE:
Constant random pains and muscle twitches
Dissociation and heavy derealization 
Terrible sleep
Constant depression
Extreme “free floating” anxiety
Foggy vision
Extreme irritability
Worse brain fog then before AND a lot more
Intense cravings

Natural excitement
Not impulsive
