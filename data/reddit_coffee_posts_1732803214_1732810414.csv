No pertinent history

Take lexapro 10mg daily and Zyrtec daily

For the past (at least) 3 months I have had a headache that lasts at least 3 hours nearly daily. Tylenol/advil do help them but not always. The headaches are sometimes paired with feeling like my eyes can’t focus on my screen. 

I do have bad posture, and sometimes get tension headaches, but these feel different. These headaches originate from the front of my head, and feel most intense around my eyebrows and between my eyes. 

I have a history of generalized anxiety disorder and OCD, but have been in therapy for years and manage my stress levels very well, so it’s not like I’m more stressed or anxious than usual. 

I don’t drink too much coffee and I drink plenty of water. 

I have been putting off going to the doctor and just concluding that I’ve developed migraines. My doctor has a tendency to chalk everything up to my having anxiety, but this is not that. I just haven’t felt like dealing with being brushed off. 

If a patient came to you with these complaints, would anxiety be your first thought? What else could be going on here? ",1,1732810132.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1h1z9cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SummerOk4391/comments/1h1z9cr/im_getting_pushed_out_of_a_group_project_from_a/,I’m getting pushed out of a group project from a guy I rejected last year. What do I do?,"Hello everyone, first time posting, also English is not my first language so I’m sorry for any mistakes. Names are fake but I will be giving you details about what happened so you have the full picture. 

So I’m studying computer science right now at a college, I’m in my second year and we have to do group project. We need to create an application as a group, this means we need to have an original idea, program it using whatever computer language we want, and do a report on the process and then present everything. Last year,before he hit on me, we had a similar project, and in the team we assembled there were 4 of us, two guys, two girls. The guy who is the problem will be guy A, and the other one will be guy B. Me and the other girl were cooperating fully doing our part, guy B barely helped, didn’t even help present the project, and the guy A completely took over everything like we were simply there because the teacher ordered us to be there and we had no value to add. Never mind that his ideas for the group project were all from chat gpt, they were completely shitty ideas, and my idea was the one the team voted for (not relevant but blood sugar tracking app for diabetic people, and we added, with my connections, general instructions from actual doctors for each type of diabetes). Anyways my problem with the first project is that only he made the code for the project, allowing only the other girl to help with the gui stuff and some code, I did all the writing and getting info from academic sites and actual doctors, the guy B did nothing. After the year ended and we had written our final exams, the team decided to go for some coffee, unfortunately the other the girl did nothing join us but I still went with the other two guys. After the coffee the guy B had to go to work, so the A guy asked me to show him around the city(the college is online for the out of town students and he lives three hours away) and we also went for some dinner some drinks and bowling. After that he started texting me and we talked for a few days before he started being creepy. By creepy I mean completely disgusting, first thing in the morning he would text my actual pornographic material, or gorey(idk how to spell that sorry) videos with animals eating one another. I asked him immediately to not sent me again anything like this. But guess what he did? He continues to text me stuff like that, including links to porn videos, for a few more days. I stop responding, leavjng him on read, or not opening his texts, unless it’s something about school. Time passes and the next year starts and now I’m in a group with guy A and the other girl from the same group(granted I did ask both of them do be in a group all together again, leaving guy B out since he had another group). And the same stuff as the first project is happening, except this time he doesn’t even speak to me, he only refers to the other girl. When we were talking about ideas for the project, his were once again from chat gpt, and they weren’t even ideas they were features to add to an app, so we once again went with my idea(app for hotels to better manage their guests, with notes, calendars and different hotel locations). Now when I presented this idea we all agreed to go with it, and then guy A started asking SPECIFICALLY the other girl what she thought about my idea. He literally was in the group chat texting things like “Hey …….(blank for privacy reasons) what do you really thinks about her(he refers to me by name here) idea?”. She never specifically answers what he wants her to, cause she is a nice person and has figured him out and instead supports me, so he stops asking things like that. Some time goes by, it’s mid November now, and it’s time for the team to get organized and start making the program cause we need to deliver it by the start of January. So I text the group chat asking, how do we wanna divide the work, guy A answers saying he already started the code, I say ok great, and then I ask, referring to both of them, “Are we doing this like last year, where only you and the other girl wrote the code, or since we are only three people this year can I also help?” And he leaves my on fucking read. The other girl still hasn’t answered or seen the texts, which is fine cause she made it clear at the start of the project that she has a shitty work schedule. So i just don’t know what to do from this point. I understand that it’s definitely my fault for asking to team up with that guy again since his attitude towards me, before he was rejected, was not very nice by any means, and I should have known it would only get worse this year, but I though like “Hey I’ve been professional towards him on all things about the school so maybe he will do the same, since I know he at least pulls his weight in the project I can ask him.” 
So yea definitely my fault there, but I don’t feel good just doing nothing of importance to the project again and just getting the grade that he earns with his code. Should I talk to the teacher? Should I try talking with him? Or with the whole team? Or should I just do nothing and do whatever he tells me to?(which also doesn’t seem like a great solution for me). Any help is appreciated. Also I’m sorry this was so long but I felt I had to give every detail so I could receive appropriate advice. Thank you everyone and have a good day!!",1,1732810114.0,u_SummerOk4391,0,1.0,False

Hey y’all - 

I have a question for all baristas!
Mods- if this isn’t allowed please remove! Ty 


I am a very light coffee drinker who likes essentially coffee flavored milk.

My fave is the iced caramel brûlée latte with one espresso shot and oatmilk topped with sweet vanilla cold foam. 

I usually order it by saying “ hi can I please get a Venti iced caramel Brulé latte with just one espresso shot?” And it’s usually around $10.

Why is it that the prices stay the same if I’m getting just one espresso shot?

So to try to bring the price down I started ordering one espresso shot with crème brûlée syrups filled with oat milk in a Venti cup. Then I noticed that the barista only splashed oatmeal on top and filled it with a crazy amount of ice. 

Exact alternative/cheaper order was: iced single shot of espresso with 5 pumps of caramel brûlée syrup, top it off with oatmilk then vanilla sweet cold foam 

Sometimes depending on the location and the Bariasta they will be kind and just top it off all the way with oat milk, some don’t and tell me they’re not allowed to do it. Today I asked if they can just charge me extra for the extra oatmeal to top it off with. She said no that’s not possible and there isn’t an option to give you any more oat milk. She said if I wanted more oat milk then I would have to just order a latte for $10 even though I’m only getting one espresso shot. 

So why is it that I’m getting less coffee and more oatmilk but I’m paying the same price?? She said I have to pay if I want my drinks to be all the way filled regardless if it’s with 4 shots of espresso or more oatmilk. I just ended up paying for $10 drink as there was a line forming.

I just feel like I can’t go to Starbucks to get my sugary milky coffee drinks as I’m perceived as a weirdo or childish. It was a humiliating experience as I felt pretty judged. 

Please advise on how I can order better, should I bring my own oatmilk (lol) or should I just stop ordering all together :(?

Me and my family have chickens, so plenty of our “scraps” are given to them as treats and filler to stretch out their feed pellets.

However some things they can’t have, and I tend to overshoot when brewing coffee. Sometimes we drink it all, sometimes there is some leftover in the pot.

Other than things that come to mind for me like iced coffee/shakes, ice cream, composting, and red eye gravy, I am sure there can be other uses for it I am unaware of. 

Any tips and suggestions would be greatly appreciated, since as a coffee lover, it pains me pouring the leftover down the sink! 🤣

I don’t even know if she’s interested.,"I met this girl on Hinge, and we've only gone on two dates so far. We're both recent college graduates from out of state who moved to the same city for work. On our first date, we connected well at a new bakery as we shared ethnicity (which was rare in the city we’re at), we both work in corporate, and both having the same breed of dog back at our families’ homes. After the date, she texted me first to thank me for treating her to coffee and pastries, and mentioned that she had a great time. I responded that I enjoyed it too and suggested we do something again, which she said she gladly be open to.
My concern is that I'm not sure if she’s really interested in me, as sometimes she responds late, especially during weekdays, which I totally understand because we both work in demanding corporate jobs. Her job is a lot more demanding than me as her industry usually requires entry levels to work at least 60 hours a week.

But her texts are never dry, though—she responds enthusiastically and in multiple texts, and she only responds promptly in weekend or soon before/after our dates.

She even casually suggested future plans we could do, but we didn't make solid plans for our next meetup since we were both were flying to visit our families for Thanksgiving and we wouldn’t see each other for almost 2 weeks.
After the date, I walked her to her car, she told me she had a lot of fun and we hugged goodbye. I texted her that I had a great time and wished her a fun Thanksgiving.

A week later, I sent her some pictures of my dog, and she replied saying he was adorable and mentioned that she was visiting her cousin at the moment and will send pictures of her dog later in the week when she visited her parents.

Now, it’s been a couple of days since then, and I’m feeling anxious that she may not follow up with the pictures, especially since I assume she’s traveling to her parents.

1h1z1pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1h1z1pd/is_a_blood_test_a_good_idea/,Is a blood test a good idea?,"My husband (47 cis M) is an alcoholic, and has been for the past 25 yrs, with his drinking escalating predictably over time. He's taken supplements for years - taurine, D, K2, magnesium, niacin, milk thistle, and daily Claritin.

His usual intake is a pint of whiskey on weeknights, at least most of a fifth on Saturday, and whatever's left over from the fifth plus another pint on Sunday.

This week I noticed that he's acting much more drunk after a pint than he used to. Idk if it was gradual and I'm just now noticing, but it's a significant change. He used to be pretty functional after a pint. Just a little less precise in his motor skills and more forgetful. A fifth makes him very wobbly, stumbling, passing out, stereotypical drunk. He's acting fifth drunk after a pint.

I know the most logical reason is that he's drinking more than a pint, or using other substances. I truly believe this isn't happening. Receipts and bottles match, and he isn't pulling cash. He isn't left alone in the house. He doesn't go out. Bc we have an agreement that he won't hide his drinking, he tells me even if he has a tasting sip at the liquor store. I use edibles medicinally, and the only ones missing are the ones I'm using. (He doesn't care for them, but I keep track anyway.)

He isn't jaundiced and we haven't noticed easier bruising. He drinks a lot of water, tea, coffee and soda, easily 4 liters a day. Of course he urinates a lot, usually a 3-4 on [this](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/beattheheat/Pages/urine-colour-chart.aspx) color chart during the day, but downright orange in the mornings. And he often has diarrhea that comes on suddenly. His finger joints are red and swollen, but he has a family history of arthritis (his dad, who was also an alcoholic but is now sober).

Is there enough reason for concern to warrant having blood/urine tests for organ function? If so, what should our first priority be? We're on a tight budget and he refuses to see a family Dr, but is open to taking LabCorp tests.

The smiles and the fist bumps started at first at the gym , which slowly turned to us talking there and then we exchanged numbers and the talks went beyond the gym . And after a month or so of taking he asked me out in the most gentlemanly way possible . Not that I was looking for that but it surely felt well . And I did say yes . We went out for dinner in a nice quiet place . Spent hours laughing and having the best possible vibe I’ve had in the last two decades . And then out of no where i asked him to come in the house when he was dropping me off . Maybe I was being devious . But I did that . It was around 11 pm and he obliged . I made coffee for us and then we got cozy on the  couch and this was after i took my leave to get changed up and I slid into my satin  purple coloured night gown and that getting cozy on the couch led to a night which made me feel like I was in paradise .

1h1yx5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_curatedwellness/comments/1h1yx5s/do_you_know_which_everyday_foods_might_be_quietly/,Do you know which everyday foods might be quietly damaging your gut?,"For anyone who wants to take care of their gut, we should stay away from a few items that lead to the growth of “bad bacteria."" To assist you, we've put together a list of the eight worst foods for gut health.

# 1. Processed Foods

Processed foods are those items that are not in their original or whole form. We can classify processed food into two categories: lightly processed food and highly processed food.  
  
A good example of lightly processed vegetables is pre-cut vegetables. They are still healthy foods and don’t do a lot of damage. However, highly processed food contains high levels of preservatives, leading to harmful bacteria growth.  
  
Preservatives in heavily processed foods help maintain their shelf life in grocery stores, but they might not be so suitable for your gut health. In fact, they may put you at risk for various other gastrointestinal issues. Another fact about these processed foods is that they lack fiber, which’s crucial for your gut and digestion.

# 2. Refined Sugar

Refined sugar has earned its negative reputation over time, and justifiably so. Sugar users harm not only their immune systems, but also their dental and gut health.  
  
Researchers have found that it negatively affects the balance of your gut microbiota.

# 3. Sugar Substitutes

Refined sugar isn't the sole sweetener you should keep off your list.  
  
Be cautious with artificial sweeteners, too. You might find them attractive because they cut calories. But note that it’s a scam! They are basically sorbitol and aspartame, silently impacting your gut biome.  
  
[**Studies**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9029443/) indicate that these sweeteners can:

* Change the makeup of your gut microbes.
* Sugar weakens your body's ability to handle it.
* Raise your chances of developing metabolic disorders.

# 4. Animal Protein

For anyone worried about their gastrointestinal condition, a vegan or vegetarian diet would be appropriate. Eating plenty of protein was never the better option. It can throw off the count of intestinal microorganisms.  
  
Animals use nearly half of the antibiotics sold in the US.  
  
Therefore, consuming their meat may potentially expose you to antibiotics. Your gut bacteria may change, increasing your risk of inflammatory bowel disease.  
  
Various types of animal protein have been linked to gut issues.

* Red meat
* Chicken and other poultry
* Farm-raised fish
* Eggs

# 5. Dairy Items

For some people, lactose can be difficult to digest. As a result, doctors recommend avoiding diary items such as milk and cheese.  
  
So for those consuming too much dairy, it can be another reason your gut isn’t healthy. Expect more stomach problems and inflammation.

# 6. Gluten

Gluten is a type of protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It causes issues for those with gluten sensitivity. It's in many foods, such as:

* Bread
* Bagels
* Pasta
* Pizza
* Cereals
* Cookies
* Cakes
* Donuts

# 7. Alcohol

Drinking alcohol has now become a big part of our lives. It’s so common to have a cold beer on any good or sad occasion. However, no one realizes its impact until they see some red alerts.  
  
Here are some ways alcohol can negatively affect your gut:

* It can increase inflammation.
* It can alter your gut microbiota's balance.
* It can cause harmful gut bacteria to grow too much.
* It can make your gut more permeable. It means more harmful pathogens get into your bloodstream.

Given these impacts, it’s wise to drink alcohol in moderation. Cutting it out completely would be even more beneficial for your gut health.

# 8. Fried Appetizers

The urge to munch on our favorite fried food is undeniable.  
  
Note that although they taste great, they can be tough on your gut. This can lead to numerous gastric problems for those who consume them.  
  
Fried foods could lead to stomach cramps, gas, or diarrhea. Furthermore, the heavy fat in these foods may upset the gut flora balance, allowing dangerous germs to influence your immune system.

# 9. Coffee

There are numerous ways caffeine affects the usual workings of your gut. It produces stomach acid, which is a major influence. It usually happens when you drink caffeine on an empty stomach or have too much.  
  
Here are a few impacts of too much stomach acid: Acid Reflux

* Stomach walls are impacted.
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease
* Heartburn
* Gastritis
* Irritated esophagus

We usually recommend moderate amounts of caffeine. In some cases, it's even beneficial for your gut bacteria. Too much of it can cause imbalance. Medical terminology refers to it as dysbiosis.",1,1732809186.0,u_curatedwellness,0,1.0,False

I want to preface this by saying the SD is very emotionally capable and socially aware and advanced (not on the spectrum or emotionally immature which could be an excuse).

Seeking advice please: I’m beside myself 😭

I gave my flat over to my 19F SD so that she could go to uni and have a better future. We moved out to a bigger house in the countryside cos I’m Pregnant. We arranged for family to cover all stepdaughter’s bills (there’s also an extreme housing crisis in our city so she was very lucky to get a whole flat to herself). She abused our kindness, stole money, used my credit card behind my back, & trashed the place. Dropped out of all classes and then went home to her mother when we tried to make her accountable. Didn’t say goodbye , thanks or sorry. She hasn’t communicated with me or her dad since. 

I haven’t said anything to her about anything at all and I’m biting my tongue:
Mainly I’m just so confused and I don’t know what to do. This is all so new to me.

I (37F) have been with my SO (38M) for 4 years. We live in Berlin as expats. He is Scandinavian and left his home country 10 years ago when his relationship with the BM (38F) broke down. Truth be told they were only together since the had a kid together when they were 18. So my SD is 19F and lives with BM.

BM has never really had a real job and lives of an extreme and unlimited $$$ cashflow from my husband’s mother. SD also gets a very generous allowance every month but it turns out that’s not enough since she also ended up stealing from us and using my credit card. 

SD, BM and I have had a very lovely, kind and caring friendship and relationship since I came into the picture 4 years ago . BM and SD came and stayed in our tiny apartment for a week last year and we all had a great time. My husband is pretty cautious with BM and not as close due to history together. 

I have been honestly the model of a perfect stepmother even if I do say so myself. I’ve only been around for 4 years and I have done so much to include her and improve her life, including taking her on overseas holidays with my side of the family, helping with her uni and future, being emotionally there and her friend and all of that. Most recently giving her my flat with all my antique furniture and also arranging an internship for her at my company which she just destroyed. 

To be honest I have taken on my role as SM to really be a friend and support and reinforce the  and BF parenting decisions or just be a confidant for things SD hasn’t felt comfortable to tell her parents. I really take a backseat and just try to give her opportunities and positivity. 

She always had a little spoilt edge to her or a little entitled but I just let it go.

She told me about 12 months ago she wants to study in Berlin so I made it happen. My husband and I moved out of our city flat, left it as is with all the bills paid and full of antique expensive furniture, we ourselves moved to a countryside house since I’m now pregnant anyway, and it’s empty so we are filling it up with furniture. All with huge expense and financial support from my parents and husbands parents. I got her an internship at my company. We bought her a load of new stuff for the flat to her liking. 

Husband and BM are quite permissive and allow her to drink and smoke and have her gf sleep over etc. 

So here’s the problem. She was here for 3 weeks before she decided she wants to pack it all in , drop out of all her classes and go home to her mother. That leaves us in a bad financial position due to the extra cost and outlay of this second residential property full of furniture. She absolutely refused to even try to make it past Xmas. Husband talked to her about her choices and it became clear she just isn’t ready to grow up: she has no plan for the future and “doesnt owe anyone an explanation or a plan”. She wants to “live day by day”. She literally had no plan.

After that announcement She waited two weeks to go home since she had already booked for her ex to come and stay with her (with stolen money from me and my husband it turned out in the end). Here is what happened next. She left on Sunday with no goodbye , thank you or sorry.

On Tuesday , I just had my 22 week baby scan and came to the flat to turn off the heating since it’s empty now. It’s completely trashed with rotten piles of food under the bed, in the lounge room and piles of trash everywhere. Rotting meat etc. I started cleaning and counted 8 bags so far. I’m also supposed to work but needed to take the day off. It wasn’t just dirty it was trashed on a level that requires physical effort. It’s like rock stars trashing a hotel room: it was deliberate : the only other thing she could have done is spray painted “fck you” on the wall. I just don’t know where this came from or how to deal with it. 
I took a pic of the trash bags, the spat out chewing tobacco next to the bed, the huge stains on the freshly painted walls that looks like someone threw coffees against the wall in every room.

I was about to text my stepdaughter (we haven’t spoken since she left , I have not said a single word of disapproval so far), something like “I just got back from my baby scan and all is great. It wasn’t great to clean the flat” and send her pics of the trash bags I collected so far. I also can’t clean with the hard chemicals required to disinfect the place due to the pregnancy. But it stinks rotten in here.

But I stopped myself. I don’t know what to do. 

I decided to think it through. I spoke with my husband. 

My husband’s plan is just to call his mother and explain everything directly and tell her to cut off all the money. Problem with my husband is I just don’t know what he will say but I know he will downplay it. For example he still hasn’t mentioned the credit card use.  He said I can do anything I want in addition to that. He doesn’t want to communicate with his ex or send photos and stuff cos he thinks it’s petty 

I just want the trashed house to be addressed somehow. I can’t speak to my husband about it anymore because he is overloaded with the topic and we have been fighting about the SD daily. The main issue being that he can’t handle the stress of not having the answer  and just starts freaking out at me.

With the BM, I tried gently broaching the topic framed as “it must be nice having stepdaughter with you back home. Btw do you think she’s ok? I am a little concerned with her wellbeing and not sure she’s attending school so I’m glad you can keep an eye on her” (aka she has completely dropped out of every class). BM shut it down immediately saying everything is fine. She doesn’t want to know and made it clear I shouldn’t talk about it.

I’m having the baby and i know that in the future the SD will want to come and visit. Additionally I feel like I need some sort of resolution on this topic so I can close rhe chapter and move on. It’s not realistic to cut her out of my life and I want my husband to have a relationship with her.

What do I do? I’m beside myself: is there anyone more experienced than me who can help? I don’t want to be the bad guy and I also don’t want to allow bad behaviour. I also need to not be stressed cos of the pregnancy .

my boyfriend recently cut back on caffeine, saying he wants to let his body ""tell him how tired he is"" so he can have a better time respecting where he's at & not over exerting himself. he doesn't have EDS/chronic fatigue though, which i feel is important to note. but he's cool and insightful :) 

given my history with overexerting due to caffeine use, i loved this idea for myself. i recently cut back to half an espresso shot a day. i feel more in tune with the constant fatigue, which seems to be both a blessing and a curse. i'm not pushing myself too hard, but i'm also not functioning as ""efficiently"" given that im not running on that extra energy, and i'm always kinda freaking tired lol. though i was always freaking tired before, it just feels... different. like im not super mentally wired and then super physically tired, i get a little boost and then roll through the day at the same level of tired on both ends.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

After entering the store I asked for my groceries and then the store owner asked me where I live. Well at first I thought he was just trying to make conversations maybe he got bored at work. After telling him I'm a local he kept pestering me to know my exact location. Kept asking me to tell him what building and area I'm from even though it was super clear I wasn't interested in divulging all those information to a store that I stepped on for the first time. Anyways after a while, he started asking me the price of the items I wanted to purchase. Like aren't you suppose to know them as the shop owner?

1h1yf1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyInLaws/comments/1h1yf1y/sil_actually_causing_me_to_feel_ill/,SIL actually causing me to feel ill. ,"My SIL is staying with us, she’s been here since November 21st and will be here until December 4th.

Since she’s arrived my energy has been slowly depleted. I also feel like I’ve been gaslit and low key emotionally abused by her. She is a full grown adult, 27 years old.

It’s just always something with her, first of all she’s an extremely picky eater but to an insane level. We took an overnight trip in a city in our state, and she wouldn’t eat anything! She doesn’t like ANY food that’s not French fries, tortillas, (sometimes beans), doesn’t like really anything remotely healthy. Which is fine, but every single time we’d go out she’d say “there’s nothing for me to eat here”, we’d have to go like I kid you not 4-5 different places until she found something. She nitpicks what/how I eat constantly, claiming it’s “not enough, or not enough protein” when all she eats is carbs. I have PCOS and on medication which has made me lose weight, and another medication I take makes me very full and not eat as much as I used to. She makes sure to point out how “unhealthy” this is during every single meal. Even though from what I can see her main food group is chips and sugary coffee drinks. But I’ve held my tongue. She thought this was normal. 
Then, she was very rude to me up until I finally broke down crying, and now I feel like she’s being nice but passive aggressive nice. She stays up until 3-4am and then wakes up late.


Yesterday we wanted to get some Thanksgiving cooking done and she insisted on beginning her cooking at 12am, she said this was tradition. However we were up until 3am finishing the cooking. I woke up and now feel sick & exhausted. Also, I know I had a choice to go to sleep and I did but she was clinking and clanking and blending and all of my kitchen lights on until 3am (we live in an apartment) so it kept me awake. I told her that quiet hours are at 10pm, and that our kitchen is right above my neighbors room so to try and be quiet. And she told me they needed to “deal with it” because it’s Thanksgiving and people are going to cook. I told her not everyone celebrates Thanksgiving and that they are pretty strict about quiet hours, especially if somebody is blending or using he vacuum in the kitchen past 2am. She said that the neighbors live in apartments so should not only expect noise, but need to “deal with it” because it’s Thanksgiving.


I just don’t know, I feel like she does things her way or the highway. She gets angry at me for not agreeing with her that we have to go to a billion different restaurants just for her to end up ordering french fries or not liking what she ordered. Her bedtime is so late, and she doesn’t respect that I don’t sleep that late. She took over and controlled cooking everything for Thanksgiving and hovered over me as I made my ONE potato dish. It’s been in my family for years and she kept hovering over me as I made it asking “hmm is that enough of this? Or this?” Or made comments like “that’s not enough seasoning” 

Another example, is I have an online class right now and haven’t worked on anything because I’ve been spending time with her and my husband and haven’t wanted to be rude. But I have stuff due today, and told her yesterday I needed to work on it so I wouldn’t be stuck doing it today. She threw a huge fit and claimed I was ruining the “holiday vibes”. So I ended up not doing it yesterday, as by the time I finally sat down at my laptop it was so late. I felt so uncomfortable by her adult tantrum due to me needing to work on school during the “holiday week” But now, Thanksgiving is today and I’m going to be stuck doing it. I just feel so frustrated like I’m dealing with a small child. On top of all this, she’s barely paid for any of her food or meals during her stay. I’ve let this go. But it’s been pretty annoying as even I help my husband with a lot of stuff we split things most of the time. So the fact that she has put my husband and I in this position, by bringing no money with her has been really annoying. 


I’m just so beyond annoyed. I don’t know how to get along with her. I’ve tried but I just feel like I genuinely do not get along with her. I find her to be completely unreasonable, self-centered, inconsiderate, and to be honest kind of bitchy. I don’t know how to get along with her. ",2,1732807782.0,ShittyInLaws,0,1.0,False

”*Mark my words - when your children return from the sea, withered and bloodless, may my divination sing softly in your ears until the last, labored breath escapes your lungs.”*

*""Leave - or die.”* 

Prophecies, clairvoyance, soothsaying - no matter how you choose to label it, humanity certainly has an obsessive fascination with the concept of fortune-telling. As an example, review the plotlines of your favorite pieces of media - how many of those stories rely on a “foretold prophecy” to propel their chain of events? I would predict a majority of them do. Even if there isn’t a literal prophecy, how many of those narratives utilize foreshadowing to give the story dramatic resonance once the plot is revealed in full? From *Oedipus* to *Narnia*, the concept of prophecies has always enchanted and captivated us, especially when said prophecy is weaponized against a particular individual or a group of individuals. In other words, a curse- something very much akin to the example listed above, which will serve as the focal point for the narrative I intend to spin.  

The way I see it, this fascination with “the gift of the second sight” is deep-seated within our shared nature. It speaks to us, enthralling our imagination in a way very few other concepts do - but why is that? I believe we treasure the idea of prophecies because their existence implies the presence of a broader narrative playing itself out behind the scenes of our lives, even if we cannot always appreciate it. If the future can be predicted, or even manipulated, then the world may not be as sadistically random and chaotic as it often appears. Prophecies can serve to calm our existential dread by indirectly minimizing our fears regarding the cold entropy of the universe.  

But therein lies the problem - that cultural reverence for prophecies can make even the most rational person susceptible to unfounded, illogical thought. Combine that irrationality with grief and a dash of impulsivity, and the whole thing can become a powder keg waiting to blow.

 A phenomenon that Yuri Thompson can attest to firsthand.  

“I just wasn’t thinking straight” Yuri somberly recounted to me from the inside of Halawa Correctional Facility.  

“In the moment, it connected all the dots - made my son’s death ‘make sense’, so to speak. It felt entirely too cruel to be random. Of course, it wasn’t *actually* random. I mean, there was an explanation to how it happened. Certainly wasn’t a damn curse, though.” The forty-five-year-old was feverishly tapping his index finger against the steel table as he detailed the tragic circumstances, betraying a lingering frustration in his actions that I imagine may persist for the rest of his sentence, if not for the rest of his life. 

Yuri has another three years to serve. He is more than halfway through his stint for manslaughter, but I’m sure that benchmark is only a meager solace to the bereaved father.  

Halfway through our interview, the familiarity of Yuri’s perceptions and mistakes made a figurative lightning bolt glide down my spine. The whole story reminded me of one of my absolute favorite historical anecdotes - the legend of Spain’s bleeding bread. 

Bear with me through this tangent - I promise the connections will become clear as Yuri’s story unfolds.  

In 1480, the Spanish Inquisition had just started revving its proverbial engines. To briefly review, the aim of the government-ordained inquest was to identify individuals who had publicly converted to Catholicism, but who were also still practicing their previous, now outlawed, religions in secret. On the island of Mallorca, the largest of Spain’s water-locked territories, a local soothsayer would inflame the underlying religious tensions that drove the inquisition to the point of deadly hysteria. Ferrand de Valeria’s prophecy would turn a revving engine into a runaway vehicle.  

At the time, Mallorca was suffering through a small famine. In the grand scheme of things, the famine was mild and manageable, but the lack of resources still resulted in significant anguish. Consumed by zealotry, Ferrand theorized that the ongoing practice of Judaism behind closed doors was the root cause of the famine - divine punishment from the almighty for not driving out the heretics. To that end, he repeatedly warned the townspeople to be vigilant for signs of covertly Jewish individuals taking a barbarous pleasure in “tormenting the body of Christ”. In other words, Ferrand believed that these heretics could be identified if they were caught red-handed with “bleeding bread” (In Catholicism, communion is the belief that bread was/is the body of Christ, so from his prospective, torturing it could cause literal bleeding). He then prophesied the following: if the island ignored the infestation of heretics and the “bleeding bread”, the famine would worsen to the point of their extinction.  

An insane, albeit darkly comedic, proposition - at least by modern standards. However, as it often does, comedy sadly evolved into tragedy given enough time. One of the island’s clergymen was visiting a family of four’s small home. When offered a slice of bread by the mother of the family, he gladly accepted. Despite the ongoing famine, the mother felt that it was critical to still practice Christ-like generosity. Unfortunately, this generosity would only be met with bloodshed, in more ways than one - as she cut into the loaf, the clergyman noticed what appeared to him as a “latent bloodstain”, present on the interior of the bread. He quickly rushed out of the house with Ferrand’s words echoing in his mind. A frenzied, moral panic ensued once the remainder of the island heard about what the clergyman witnessed. Once the panic hit a boiling point, the generous mother, along with her entire family, were wiped out, even though the Inquisition’s subsequent investigation found no evidence of them practicing any religion apart from Catholicism - excluding the bleeding bread, of course. The famine did not abate after their death, and I would imagine it’s no shock to reveal at this point that the bread in the tale did not actually bleed.  

Let that half-complete anecdote simmer in your mind as we review Yuri’s story.  

Yuri Thompson moved to the humble coastal town of Ala’hu in the Spring of 2025, with his son Lee (six years old) and his wife Charlotte (forty-eight years old) in tow. With the earnings from a successful tech startup flooding his back account, Yuri had settled into an early retirement, content with living the rest of his days in a serene, tropical contentment. 

“Our home had been newly developed”, Yuri recalled.  

“We were initially worried about how we’d be received on the island. I mean, Charlotte and I were wealthy tech magnates moving into an estate complex that was otherwise surrounded by more modest costal homes, ones that had been built by the ancestors of the people who lived there, likely with their own hands, upwards of a century ago. But honestly, we were welcomed with open arms, for the most part.” 

With that last sentence, Yuri’s expression darkened - blackened like storm clouds crawling over the horizon.  

He was alluding to Koa Hekekia, the fifty-six-year-old women who had proclaimed the troublesome warning presented at the beginning of the article: 

*”Mark my words - when your children return from the sea, withered and bloodless, may my divination sing softly in your ears until the last, labored breath escapes your lungs. Leave - or die.”*

Koa was the town’s resident Kahuna. In other words, a priestess who made a living through supplying the more superstitious inhabitants of Ala’hu with alternative medicine and religious guidance. Behind closed doors, she would also provide blessings, fortunes, and curses - for the right price, of course.  

“The first time I met Koa, that so-called curse was practically the only thing she said to me” Yuri reflected, with a certain quiet indifference.  

“After the full moon had fallen, the sea would ‘swallow my children, bones and all’. As far she knew, I didn’t have any kids - but she did know that I had moved into one of those estates. I think she viewed us as a threat to her business, like our presence would snuff out the town’s superstition. She was trying to scare us away, or at least make us uncomfortable. I asked my next-door neighbor what he thought of her, and he told me not to worry - that she had threatened him and his two kids when they moved in half a year ago. Many full moons had passed, and they were still happy and healthy.” 

Yuri paused here, breaking eye contact with me. His frenetic tapping had stopped as well.  

“So, I guess I wasn’t worried. At least I didn't let worry show on the outside. I had grown up with a lot of superstitions about hexes and the like from my grandfather and some of my aunts, so internally, it did nag at me a bit. But what was I going to do - move my family back to California because of the ravings from some unhinged loon?” 

“A month after we arrived, Charlotte, Lee and I were spending a day at a local beach. Lee and I were boogie boarding, which he absolutely adored.”

Another pause, longer this time. The air in the room became heavy with emotion, thick and difficult to breathe. After about two minutes passed, Yuri began to speak again: 

“We were catching a wave together, when I noticed blood on my hand. I turned Lee towards me and asked if he was okay. His nose was bleeding, and he looked like he was going to pass out. I tucked him into my chest and swam as quickly as I could to shore” 

By the time EMS arrived, Lee’s heart had stopped - he had seemingly gone into spontaneous cardiac arrest. Despite an hour of CPR, medical professionals were unable to bring Lee back.  

“I don’t think I ever said to myself, in my head or out-loud, that I thought ‘the curse had come true’. Maybe if I did, that would have been enough of a red flag to slow me down - to make me realize I wasn’t thinking clearly. It was more subconscious than that, though. My son died while in the ocean, I vaguely recalled seeing a full moon in the previous few nights, and I had witnessed Lee bleed, which was all in line with what Koa prophesied. The neighbor, the one that had reassured me, also lost a daughter that day. Same thing: cardiac arrest out of the blue while in the ocean. Our collective grief played off each other. When he mentioned he knew where Koa’s shop was, I didn’t have to say anything else. He didn’t have to, either.” 

Our interview ended there. I knew the full story coming into this, so Yuri did not need to rehash the details of that night to me. My understanding of the events was this: after a very brief interrogation, Yuri choked Koa until she lost consciousness, and then proceeded to toss her down a flight of stairs into the shop’s cellar. The trauma of the fall had broken Koa’s neck, killing her in the blink of an eye.  

A total of five people had perished that fateful afternoon - three children and two female adults, all in a manner identical to Lee’s death. When Yuri mentioned that this could have been avoided if he slowed down, I think he may have been right. This wasn’t a pattern of behavior for him - he had no criminal record, and the last proper fight he had been a part of was, per him, in middle school. Not only that, but he had a wildly successful tech career - clearly indicating that he had a rational head on his shoulders. If he had evaluated all the facts, he may have noticed that the circumstances didn’t completely align with Koa’s prophecy. 

The most blaring inconsistency was this: the majority of the people who died did not live in the estates. The two adults and the third child were all born on the island. If they died as a result of said curse, this hex was more like a shotgun than a rife - firing broadly and catching island natives in the crossfire. Not only that, but it had been nine days since the last full moon, not the day directly after a full moon like Koa had detailed.  

Lee’s death, however, made Yuri vulnerable to disregarding inconvenient inconsistencies. The event felt so inherently heinous, and so exceptional in its cruelty, that it needed an answer more narratively satisfactory than dispassionate chance - more powerful than simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Uncaring randomness didn’t carry an equal dramatic weight when compared to the diabolical byproduct of an evil hex.  

Koa, to her detriment, had provided that explanation in advance. But in reality, Lee’s death was simply a result of entropy - an unpredictable consequence of being in the wrong place at the time.  

So, where does the prophecy of the bleeding bread tie into all of this? I’ll let Dr. Tiffany Hall, senior marine biologist out of the University of Miami, clarify the connection:  

“I’ve always loved that story” Dr. Hall said, with a wry, playful smile that quickly morphed into an expression of embarrassment when she realized the potential, out of context implications of that statement. 

“I mean I don’t love what happened - that part is horrific. But it is a wonderful example of a supernatural phenomenon becoming biologically explainable, given enough time” 

“*Serratia marcescens* is a species of bacteria that doesn’t intersect with humanity that frequently. It can cause an infection, but only if a person’s immune system is completely non-functional. That being said, it’s pretty abundant in our environment - growing wherever there is available moisture. Hydration is a requirement for the fermentation that allows yeast to become bread, and that moisture allows these bacteria to grow on bread too, almost like a mold. And as it would happen, it expresses a protein called “prodigiosin”, something that gives it a unique quality among other, similar bacteria” 

With a wink, Dr. Hall delivered the punchline: 

“It’s a red pigment - can almost look like a splotch of spilled blood if there is enough bacterial growth.” 

In the end, Mallorca’s famine was simply that - an untimely lack of resources. It wasn’t a punishment inflicted on the island due to the furtive practice of non-catholic religions, nor did the “bleeding bread” have a divine explanation. Ferrand’s prophecy and the subsequent growth of *Serrtia* on that family’s bread was purely a case of unfavorable synchrony. 

Nothing more, nothing less.  

After a brief coffee break, Dr. Hall continued:  

“I heard about the deaths out of Ala’hu right after they happened - the spontaneous cardiac arrests of a few individuals swimming in the same area. I had immediate suspicions about the culprit. When I heard that every person who died was either a child or a smaller-sized adult, my theory was effectively confirmed.” 

“*Carybdea alata* \- more commonly referred to as the Hawaiian Box Jellyfish, was eventually proven to be the killer.” 

Before I had researched this story, I had no idea what in the hell a “box jellyfish” was. But it was an excellent remainder of how unabashedly bizarre and terrifying nature can be when it puts its mind to it.  

No bigger than two inches in size, these tiny devils are known to inhabit the waters in tropical and subtropical regions - most notoriously Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii. Their reproductive form is where they acquired their inappropriately cute nickname: the squishy nervous system above its tentacles has a cuboid shape, looking like a bell or a box. Despite being no bigger than the size of a quarter, when injected through the skin from their tentacles, their poison has the potential to end a person’s life in three minutes or less. 

 “We have no idea why these tiny things are so deadly - I mean we know *how* they are deadly. Their venom can cause an incredibly rapid influx of potassium into someone’s bloodstream, which can very easily make their heart stop - but what I’m trying to say is we don’t know *why* they have evolved to host this uber-potent venom. They certainly don’t have the stomach size to eat what they kill” Dr. Hall chortled endearingly.  

Not only that, but box jellyfish tend to be the most concentrated in coastal waters seven to ten days after a full moon, in-line with their reproductive cycle as well as with the tragic deaths, being nine days after the most recent full moon. Additionally, it is likely that many other people got stung on the day Lee and the other four died - but the more body mass you have, the more the toxin is diluted, which can make the effects less severe and non-life threatening. The children and the two smaller adults likely succumbed to the venom due to their smaller body size. 

“I’ve watched the documentary surrounding Koa’s murder.” 

With this statement, Dr. Hall’s playfulness seemed to ominously evaporate, portending the description of an observation that very noticeably made her uneasy: 

“They showed clips of Yuri’s and Lionel’s (the neighbor who also lost a child) testimonies. What’s so strange is they were both with their kids right before they died, and they both witnessed their kids have a nosebleed directly prior to their cardiac arrest. That’s certainly not an effect of the jellyfish’s venom. It’s probably just a coincidence, I suppose, but it makes me think back to what Koa said - about them ending up bloodless, I mean.” 

I wasn’t sure how to respond to the implication, and I think Dr. Hall could tell.  

“Look at it this way - to my understanding, the media covered the case to no end. All the way from start to finish. If that media spectacle results in less waspy outsiders moving to the Hawaiian Islands out of concern for the potential dangers, then, in a sense, Koa’s prophecy had its intended effect….” she trialed off. I suspect she had more in her head, but she decided against divulging it.  

A forced smile slowly returned to Dr. Hall’s face: 

“I’m sure I’m just seeing connections where they aren’t. It does make you wonder though.” 

Truthfully, I hope she’s right - that she is seeing connections where they aren’t. Most days, I feel confidently that she is. That there was no real connective tissue between Koa and the children's deaths. Some days, however, I could be convinced otherwise. And that small but volatile part of myself - it scares me.

”*Mark my words - when your children return from the sea, withered and bloodless, may my divination sing softly in your ears until the last, labored breath escapes your lungs.”*

*""Leave - or die.”* 

Prophecies, clairvoyance, soothsaying - no matter how you choose to label it, humanity certainly has an obsessive fascination with the concept of fortune-telling. As an example, review the plotlines of your favorite pieces of media - how many of those stories rely on a “foretold prophecy” to propel their chain of events? I would predict a majority of them do. Even if there isn’t a literal prophecy, how many of those narratives utilize foreshadowing to give the story dramatic resonance once the plot is revealed in full? From *Oedipus* to *Narnia*, the concept of prophecies has always enchanted and captivated us, especially when said prophecy is weaponized against a particular individual or a group of individuals. In other words, a curse- something very much akin to the example listed above, which will serve as the focal point for the narrative I intend to spin.  

The way I see it, this fascination with “the gift of the second sight” is deep-seated within our shared nature. It speaks to us, enthralling our imagination in a way very few other concepts do - but why is that? I believe we treasure the idea of prophecies because their existence implies the presence of a broader narrative playing itself out behind the scenes of our lives, even if we cannot always appreciate it. If the future can be predicted, or even manipulated, then the world may not be as sadistically random and chaotic as it often appears. Prophecies can serve to calm our existential dread by indirectly minimizing our fears regarding the cold entropy of the universe.  

But therein lies the problem - that cultural reverence for prophecies can make even the most rational person susceptible to unfounded, illogical thought. Combine that irrationality with grief and a dash of impulsivity, and the whole thing can become a powder keg waiting to blow.

 A phenomenon that Yuri Thompson can attest to firsthand.  

“I just wasn’t thinking straight” Yuri somberly recounted to me from the inside of Halawa Correctional Facility.  

“In the moment, it connected all the dots - made my son’s death ‘make sense’, so to speak. It felt entirely too cruel to be random. Of course, it wasn’t *actually* random. I mean, there was an explanation to how it happened. Certainly wasn’t a damn curse, though.” The forty-five-year-old was feverishly tapping his index finger against the steel table as he detailed the tragic circumstances, betraying a lingering frustration in his actions that I imagine may persist for the rest of his sentence, if not for the rest of his life. 

Yuri has another three years to serve. He is more than halfway through his stint for manslaughter, but I’m sure that benchmark is only a meager solace to the bereaved father.  

Halfway through our interview, the familiarity of Yuri’s perceptions and mistakes made a figurative lightning bolt glide down my spine. The whole story reminded me of one of my absolute favorite historical anecdotes - the legend of Spain’s bleeding bread. 

Bear with me through this tangent - I promise the connections will become clear as Yuri’s story unfolds.  

In 1480, the Spanish Inquisition had just started revving its proverbial engines. To briefly review, the aim of the government-ordained inquest was to identify individuals who had publicly converted to Catholicism, but who were also still practicing their previous, now outlawed, religions in secret. On the island of Mallorca, the largest of Spain’s water-locked territories, a local soothsayer would inflame the underlying religious tensions that drove the inquisition to the point of deadly hysteria. Ferrand de Valeria’s prophecy would turn a revving engine into a runaway vehicle.  

At the time, Mallorca was suffering through a small famine. In the grand scheme of things, the famine was mild and manageable, but the lack of resources still resulted in significant anguish. Consumed by zealotry, Ferrand theorized that the ongoing practice of Judaism behind closed doors was the root cause of the famine - divine punishment from the almighty for not driving out the heretics. To that end, he repeatedly warned the townspeople to be vigilant for signs of covertly Jewish individuals taking a barbarous pleasure in “tormenting the body of Christ”. In other words, Ferrand believed that these heretics could be identified if they were caught red-handed with “bleeding bread” (In Catholicism, communion is the belief that bread was/is the body of Christ, so from his prospective, torturing it could cause literal bleeding). He then prophesied the following: if the island ignored the infestation of heretics and the “bleeding bread”, the famine would worsen to the point of their extinction.  

An insane, albeit darkly comedic, proposition - at least by modern standards. However, as it often does, comedy sadly evolved into tragedy given enough time. One of the island’s clergymen was visiting a family of four’s small home. When offered a slice of bread by the mother of the family, he gladly accepted. Despite the ongoing famine, the mother felt that it was critical to still practice Christ-like generosity. Unfortunately, this generosity would only be met with bloodshed, in more ways than one - as she cut into the loaf, the clergyman noticed what appeared to him as a “latent bloodstain”, present on the interior of the bread. He quickly rushed out of the house with Ferrand’s words echoing in his mind. A frenzied, moral panic ensued once the remainder of the island heard about what the clergyman witnessed. Once the panic hit a boiling point, the generous mother, along with her entire family, were wiped out, even though the Inquisition’s subsequent investigation found no evidence of them practicing any religion apart from Catholicism - excluding the bleeding bread, of course. The famine did not abate after their death, and I would imagine it’s no shock to reveal at this point that the bread in the tale did not actually bleed.  

Let that half-complete anecdote simmer in your mind as we review Yuri’s story.  

Yuri Thompson moved to the humble coastal town of Ala’hu in the Spring of 2025, with his son Lee (six years old) and his wife Charlotte (forty-eight years old) in tow. With the earnings from a successful tech startup flooding his back account, Yuri had settled into an early retirement, content with living the rest of his days in a serene, tropical contentment. 

“Our home had been newly developed”, Yuri recalled.  

“We were initially worried about how we’d be received on the island. I mean, Charlotte and I were wealthy tech magnates moving into an estate complex that was otherwise surrounded by more modest costal homes, ones that had been built by the ancestors of the people who lived there, likely with their own hands, upwards of a century ago. But honestly, we were welcomed with open arms, for the most part.” 

With that last sentence, Yuri’s expression darkened - blackened like storm clouds crawling over the horizon.  

He was alluding to Koa Hekekia, the fifty-six-year-old women who had proclaimed the troublesome warning presented at the beginning of the article: 

*”Mark my words - when your children return from the sea, withered and bloodless, may my divination sing softly in your ears until the last, labored breath escapes your lungs. Leave - or die.”*

Koa was the town’s resident Kahuna. In other words, a priestess who made a living through supplying the more superstitious inhabitants of Ala’hu with alternative medicine and religious guidance. Behind closed doors, she would also provide blessings, fortunes, and curses - for the right price, of course.  

“The first time I met Koa, that so-called curse was practically the only thing she said to me” Yuri reflected, with a certain quiet indifference.  

“After the full moon had fallen, the sea would ‘swallow my children, bones and all’. As far she knew, I didn’t have any kids - but she did know that I had moved into one of those estates. I think she viewed us as a threat to her business, like our presence would snuff out the town’s superstition. She was trying to scare us away, or at least make us uncomfortable. I asked my next-door neighbor what he thought of her, and he told me not to worry - that she had threatened him and his two kids when they moved in half a year ago. Many full moons had passed, and they were still happy and healthy.” 

Yuri paused here, breaking eye contact with me. His frenetic tapping had stopped as well.  

“So, I guess I wasn’t worried. At least I didn't let worry show on the outside. I had grown up with a lot of superstitions about hexes and the like from my grandfather and some of my aunts, so internally, it did nag at me a bit. But what was I going to do - move my family back to California because of the ravings from some unhinged loon?” 

“A month after we arrived, Charlotte, Lee and I were spending a day at a local beach. Lee and I were boogie boarding, which he absolutely adored.”

Another pause, longer this time. The air in the room became heavy with emotion, thick and difficult to breathe. After about two minutes passed, Yuri began to speak again: 

“We were catching a wave together, when I noticed blood on my hand. I turned Lee towards me and asked if he was okay. His nose was bleeding, and he looked like he was going to pass out. I tucked him into my chest and swam as quickly as I could to shore” 

By the time EMS arrived, Lee’s heart had stopped - he had seemingly gone into spontaneous cardiac arrest. Despite an hour of CPR, medical professionals were unable to bring Lee back.  

“I don’t think I ever said to myself, in my head or out-loud, that I thought ‘the curse had come true’. Maybe if I did, that would have been enough of a red flag to slow me down - to make me realize I wasn’t thinking clearly. It was more subconscious than that, though. My son died while in the ocean, I vaguely recalled seeing a full moon in the previous few nights, and I had witnessed Lee bleed, which was all in line with what Koa prophesied. The neighbor, the one that had reassured me, also lost a daughter that day. Same thing: cardiac arrest out of the blue while in the ocean. Our collective grief played off each other. When he mentioned he knew where Koa’s shop was, I didn’t have to say anything else. He didn’t have to, either.” 

Our interview ended there. I knew the full story coming into this, so Yuri did not need to rehash the details of that night to me. My understanding of the events was this: after a very brief interrogation, Yuri choked Koa until she lost consciousness, and then proceeded to toss her down a flight of stairs into the shop’s cellar. The trauma of the fall had broken Koa’s neck, killing her in the blink of an eye.  

A total of five people had perished that fateful afternoon - three children and two female adults, all in a manner identical to Lee’s death. When Yuri mentioned that this could have been avoided if he slowed down, I think he may have been right. This wasn’t a pattern of behavior for him - he had no criminal record, and the last proper fight he had been a part of was, per him, in middle school. Not only that, but he had a wildly successful tech career - clearly indicating that he had a rational head on his shoulders. If he had evaluated all the facts, he may have noticed that the circumstances didn’t completely align with Koa’s prophecy. 

The most blaring inconsistency was this: the majority of the people who died did not live in the estates. The two adults and the third child were all born on the island. If they died as a result of said curse, this hex was more like a shotgun than a rife - firing broadly and catching island natives in the crossfire. Not only that, but it had been nine days since the last full moon, not the day directly after a full moon like Koa had detailed.  

Lee’s death, however, made Yuri vulnerable to disregarding inconvenient inconsistencies. The event felt so inherently heinous, and so exceptional in its cruelty, that it needed an answer more narratively satisfactory than dispassionate chance - more powerful than simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Uncaring randomness didn’t carry an equal dramatic weight when compared to the diabolical byproduct of an evil hex.  

Koa, to her detriment, had provided that explanation in advance. But in reality, Lee’s death was simply a result of entropy - an unpredictable consequence of being in the wrong place at the time.  

So, where does the prophecy of the bleeding bread tie into all of this? I’ll let Dr. Tiffany Hall, senior marine biologist out of the University of Miami, clarify the connection:  

“I’ve always loved that story” Dr. Hall said, with a wry, playful smile that quickly morphed into an expression of embarrassment when she realized the potential, out of context implications of that statement. 

“I mean I don’t love what happened - that part is horrific. But it is a wonderful example of a supernatural phenomenon becoming biologically explainable, given enough time” 

“*Serratia marcescens* is a species of bacteria that doesn’t intersect with humanity that frequently. It can cause an infection, but only if a person’s immune system is completely non-functional. That being said, it’s pretty abundant in our environment - growing wherever there is available moisture. Hydration is a requirement for the fermentation that allows yeast to become bread, and that moisture allows these bacteria to grow on bread too, almost like a mold. And as it would happen, it expresses a protein called “prodigiosin”, something that gives it a unique quality among other, similar bacteria” 

With a wink, Dr. Hall delivered the punchline: 

“It’s a red pigment - can almost look like a splotch of spilled blood if there is enough bacterial growth.” 

In the end, Mallorca’s famine was simply that - an untimely lack of resources. It wasn’t a punishment inflicted on the island due to the furtive practice of non-catholic religions, nor did the “bleeding bread” have a divine explanation. Ferrand’s prophecy and the subsequent growth of *Serrtia* on that family’s bread was purely a case of unfavorable synchrony. 

Nothing more, nothing less.  

After a brief coffee break, Dr. Hall continued:  

“I heard about the deaths out of Ala’hu right after they happened - the spontaneous cardiac arrests of a few individuals swimming in the same area. I had immediate suspicions about the culprit. When I heard that every person who died was either a child or a smaller-sized adult, my theory was effectively confirmed.” 

“*Carybdea alata* \- more commonly referred to as the Hawaiian Box Jellyfish, was eventually proven to be the killer.” 

Before I had researched this story, I had no idea what in the hell a “box jellyfish” was. But it was an excellent remainder of how unabashedly bizarre and terrifying nature can be when it puts its mind to it.  

No bigger than two inches in size, these tiny devils are known to inhabit the waters in tropical and subtropical regions - most notoriously Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii. Their reproductive form is where they acquired their inappropriately cute nickname: the squishy nervous system above its tentacles has a cuboid shape, looking like a bell or a box. Despite being no bigger than the size of a quarter, when injected through the skin from their tentacles, their poison has the potential to end a person’s life in three minutes or less. 

 “We have no idea why these tiny things are so deadly - I mean we know *how* they are deadly. Their venom can cause an incredibly rapid influx of potassium into someone’s bloodstream, which can very easily make their heart stop - but what I’m trying to say is we don’t know *why* they have evolved to host this uber-potent venom. They certainly don’t have the stomach size to eat what they kill” Dr. Hall chortled endearingly.  

Not only that, but box jellyfish tend to be the most concentrated in coastal waters seven to ten days after a full moon, in-line with their reproductive cycle as well as with the tragic deaths, being nine days after the most recent full moon. Additionally, it is likely that many other people got stung on the day Lee and the other four died - but the more body mass you have, the more the toxin is diluted, which can make the effects less severe and non-life threatening. The children and the two smaller adults likely succumbed to the venom due to their smaller body size. 

“I’ve watched the documentary surrounding Koa’s murder.” 

With this statement, Dr. Hall’s playfulness seemed to ominously evaporate, portending the description of an observation that very noticeably made her uneasy: 

“They showed clips of Yuri’s and Lionel’s (the neighbor who also lost a child) testimonies. What’s so strange is they were both with their kids right before they died, and they both witnessed their kids have a nosebleed directly prior to their cardiac arrest. That’s certainly not an effect of the jellyfish’s venom. It’s probably just a coincidence, I suppose, but it makes me think back to what Koa said - about them ending up bloodless, I mean.” 

I wasn’t sure how to respond to the implication, and I think Dr. Hall could tell.  

“Look at it this way - to my understanding, the media covered the case to no end. All the way from start to finish. If that media spectacle results in less waspy outsiders moving to the Hawaiian Islands out of concern for the potential dangers, then, in a sense, Koa’s prophecy had its intended effect….” she trialed off. I suspect she had more in her head, but she decided against divulging it.  

A forced smile slowly returned to Dr. Hall’s face: 

“I’m sure I’m just seeing connections where they aren’t. It does make you wonder though.” 

Truthfully, I hope she’s right - that she is seeing connections where they aren’t. Most days, I feel confidently that she is. That there was no real connective tissue between Koa and the children's deaths. Some days, however, I could be convinced otherwise. And that small but volatile part of myself - it scares me.

Lee’s death, however, made Yuri vulnerable to disregarding inconvenient inconsistencies. The event felt so inherently heinous, and so exceptional in its cruelty, that it needed an answer more narratively satisfactory than dispassionate chance - more powerful than simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Uncaring randomness didn’t carry an equal dramatic weight when compared to the diabolical byproduct of an evil hex.  

Koa, to her detriment, had provided that explanation in advance. But in reality, Lee’s death was simply a result of entropy - an unpredictable consequence of being in the wrong place at the time.  

So, where does the prophecy of the bleeding bread tie into all of this? I’ll let Dr. Tiffany Hall, senior marine biologist out of the University of Miami, clarify the connection:  

“I’ve always loved that story” Dr. Hall said, with a wry, playful smile that quickly morphed into an expression of embarrassment when she realized the potential, out of context implications of that statement. 

“I mean I don’t love what happened - that part is horrific. But it is a wonderful example of a supernatural phenomenon becoming biologically explainable, given enough time” 

“*Serratia marcescens* is a species of bacteria that doesn’t intersect with humanity that frequently. It can cause an infection, but only if a person’s immune system is completely non-functional. That being said, it’s pretty abundant in our environment - growing wherever there is available moisture. Hydration is a requirement for the fermentation that allows yeast to become bread, and that moisture allows these bacteria to grow on bread too, almost like a mold. And as it would happen, it expresses a protein called “prodigiosin”, something that gives it a unique quality among other, similar bacteria” 

With a wink, Dr. Hall delivered the punchline: 

“It’s a red pigment - can almost look like a splotch of spilled blood if there is enough bacterial growth.” 

In the end, Mallorca’s famine was simply that - an untimely lack of resources. It wasn’t a punishment inflicted on the island due to the furtive practice of non-catholic religions, nor did the “bleeding bread” have a divine explanation. Ferrand’s prophecy and the subsequent growth of *Serrtia* on that family’s bread was purely a case of unfavorable synchrony. 

Nothing more, nothing less.  

After a brief coffee break, Dr. Hall continued:  

“I heard about the deaths out of Ala’hu right after they happened - the spontaneous cardiac arrests of a few individuals swimming in the same area. I had immediate suspicions about the culprit. When I heard that every person who died was either a child or a smaller-sized adult, my theory was effectively confirmed.” 

“*Carybdea alata* \- more commonly referred to as the Hawaiian Box Jellyfish, was eventually proven to be the killer.” 

Before I had researched this story, I had no idea what in the hell a “box jellyfish” was. But it was an excellent remainder of how unabashedly bizarre and terrifying nature can be when it puts its mind to it.  

No bigger than two inches in size, these tiny devils are known to inhabit the waters in tropical and subtropical regions - most notoriously Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii. Their reproductive form is where they acquired their inappropriately cute nickname: the squishy nervous system above its tentacles has a cuboid shape, looking like a bell or a box. Despite being no bigger than the size of a quarter, when injected through the skin from their tentacles, their poison has the potential to end a person’s life in three minutes or less. 

 “We have no idea why these tiny things are so deadly - I mean we know *how* they are deadly. Their venom can cause an incredibly rapid influx of potassium into someone’s bloodstream, which can very easily make their heart stop - but what I’m trying to say is we don’t know *why* they have evolved to host this uber-potent venom. They certainly don’t have the stomach size to eat what they kill” Dr. Hall chortled endearingly.  

Not only that, but box jellyfish tend to be the most concentrated in coastal waters seven to ten days after a full moon, in-line with their reproductive cycle as well as with the tragic deaths, being nine days after the most recent full moon. Additionally, it is likely that many other people got stung on the day Lee and the other four died - but the more body mass you have, the more the toxin is diluted, which can make the effects less severe and non-life threatening. The children and the two smaller adults likely succumbed to the venom due to their smaller body size. 

“I’ve watched the documentary surrounding Koa’s murder.” 

With this statement, Dr. Hall’s playfulness seemed to ominously evaporate, portending the description of an observation that very noticeably made her uneasy: 

“They showed clips of Yuri’s and Lionel’s (the neighbor who also lost a child) testimonies. What’s so strange is they were both with their kids right before they died, and they both witnessed their kids have a nosebleed directly prior to their cardiac arrest. That’s certainly not an effect of the jellyfish’s venom. It’s probably just a coincidence, I suppose, but it makes me think back to what Koa said - about them ending up bloodless, I mean.” 

I wasn’t sure how to respond to the implication, and I think Dr. Hall could tell.  

“Look at it this way - to my understanding, the media covered the case to no end. All the way from start to finish. If that media spectacle results in less waspy outsiders moving to the Hawaiian Islands out of concern for the potential dangers, then, in a sense, Koa’s prophecy had its intended effect….” she trialed off. I suspect she had more in her head, but she decided against divulging it.  

A forced smile slowly returned to Dr. Hall’s face: 

“I’m sure I’m just seeing connections where they aren’t. It does make you wonder though.” 

Truthfully, I hope she’s right - that she is seeing connections where they aren’t. Most days, I feel confidently that she is. That there was no real connective tissue between Koa and the children's deaths. Some days, however, I could be convinced otherwise. And that small but volatile part of myself - it scares me.

1h1y9mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI__Stories/comments/1h1y9mo/a_sweet_resolution/,A Sweet Resolution,"Gumby adjusted his hat as he stepped out of the store into the bustling streets of the inner city. The candy-covered storefront behind him sparkled unnaturally against the soot-streaked buildings and the gray sky above. Hansel had been kind, as always, but there was something about the exchange that weighed on Gumby’s mind.

He tucked the pack of cigarettes into his coat pocket and walked aimlessly. His original errands seemed trivial now. Thoughts of Pokey’s absence filled his mind like a heavy fog. His loyal friend had been more than just a companion; Pokey had been his anchor. Without him, the world felt untethered, chaotic, and unbearably lonely.

As he wandered deeper into the city, Gumby found himself in a neighborhood he didn’t recognize. The streets narrowed, and the buildings leaned closer together as if whispering secrets to one another. The cobblestones underfoot glistened with a faint sugary sheen. He glanced down and saw his footprints in what appeared to be powdered sugar.

He rounded a corner and came face-to-face with a peculiar sight: a stall made entirely of gingerbread, manned by an older woman with sharp, calculating eyes. The scent of cinnamon and warm frosting wafted toward him.

“Lost, are we?” she asked, her voice dripping with honeyed sarcasm.

“Just passing through,” Gumby replied cautiously. He’d heard stories about the inner city’s more unusual inhabitants.

The woman smirked, her crooked teeth looking almost caramelized. “Passing through won’t fill that hole in your heart.”

Gumby froze. How could she know? “I—I don’t know what you mean.”

“Oh, but I think you do,” she said, motioning to the cigarettes poking out of his pocket. “Trying to fill the void with smoke, eh? A poor substitute for friendship, if you ask me.”

Gumby’s defenses rose. “It’s not your business,” he said, though his voice wavered.

The woman shrugged and leaned forward on the gingerbread counter. “Suit yourself. But I’ll let you in on a secret. Those who cling to the past forget to live in the present.”

Her words lingered as Gumby walked away, her cackling laughter trailing him like an unwanted shadow. He turned the corner and was relieved to see the familiar sight of Hansel’s store in the distance. Somehow, his wandering had led him back.

Hansel was outside sweeping the front step, the broom’s bristles dusting away sprinkles and gumdrops. He looked up and waved as Gumby approached.

“Back so soon?” Hansel said, raising an eyebrow.

Gumby hesitated. “I guess I just needed to talk.”

Hansel leaned the broom against the wall and crossed his arms. “About Pokey?”

Gumby nodded, his eyes fixed on the ground. “It’s just… he was always the one who kept me grounded. Without him, I feel like I’m falling apart. The cigarettes, they’re the only thing that makes it bearable.”

Hansel sighed, his expression softening. “I get it. Losing someone close can shake you to your core. But do you really think Pokey would want you to cope this way?”

Gumby didn’t answer. Instead, he pulled the pack of cigarettes from his pocket and stared at it. The bright packaging seemed garish in the candy-coated light of the store.

“You know,” Hansel said, “when Gretel convinced me to quit, it wasn’t because she nagged me or guilted me. It was because she reminded me of the things I loved—her, the bakery, the simple joy of waking up without feeling like I was choking. She gave me something to hold on to.”

Gumby looked up, his expression a mix of sadness and longing. “I don’t have anyone like that anymore.”

“That’s not true,” Hansel said. “You’ve got me. And Gretel. And plenty of others who care about you more than you realize. But you have to want it, Gumby. No one can make you quit unless you decide it’s time.”

For a moment, the two stood in silence. The air smelled faintly of peppermint and caramel, a sweet contrast to the bitter taste in Gumby’s mouth.

Finally, Gumby handed the pack of cigarettes to Hansel. “Maybe it’s time I tried,” he said quietly.

Hansel took the pack but didn’t say anything. He simply placed a hand on Gumby’s shoulder and gave it a reassuring squeeze.

The next morning, Gumby stood outside his small house on the outskirts of town. The fields stretched out before him, golden and calm, a stark contrast to the chaos of the city. In his hand was a steaming cup of coffee. The craving for a cigarette was there, gnawing at the edges of his resolve, but he pushed it aside.

He glanced at the sky, where a bird soared freely, its path unbound by sorrow or habit. A faint smile crossed Gumby’s face. For the first time in a long while, he felt a glimmer of hope.

”*Mark my words - when your children return from the sea, withered and bloodless, may my divination sing softly in your ears until the last, labored breath escapes your lungs.”*

*""Leave - or die.”* 

Prophecies, clairvoyance, soothsaying - no matter how you choose to label it, humanity certainly has an obsessive fascination with the concept of fortune-telling. As an example, review the plotlines of your favorite pieces of media - how many of those stories rely on a “foretold prophecy” to propel their chain of events? I would predict a majority of them do. Even if there isn’t a literal prophecy, how many of those narratives utilize foreshadowing to give the story dramatic resonance once the plot is revealed in full? From *Oedipus* to *Narnia*, the concept of prophecies has always enchanted and captivated us, especially when said prophecy is weaponized against a particular individual or a group of individuals. In other words, a curse- something very much akin to the example listed above, which will serve as the focal point for the narrative I intend to spin.  

The way I see it, this fascination with “the gift of the second sight” is deep-seated within our shared nature. It speaks to us, enthralling our imagination in a way very few other concepts do - but why is that? I believe we treasure the idea of prophecies because their existence implies the presence of a broader narrative playing itself out behind the scenes of our lives, even if we cannot always appreciate it. If the future can be predicted, or even manipulated, then the world may not be as sadistically random and chaotic as it often appears. Prophecies can serve to calm our existential dread by indirectly minimizing our fears regarding the cold entropy of the universe.  

But therein lies the problem - that cultural reverence for prophecies can make even the most rational person susceptible to unfounded, illogical thought. Combine that irrationality with grief and a dash of impulsivity, and the whole thing can become a powder keg waiting to blow.

 A phenomenon that Yuri Thompson can attest to firsthand.  

“I just wasn’t thinking straight” Yuri somberly recounted to me from the inside of Halawa Correctional Facility.  

“In the moment, it connected all the dots - made my son’s death ‘make sense’, so to speak. It felt entirely too cruel to be random. Of course, it wasn’t *actually* random. I mean, there was an explanation to how it happened. Certainly wasn’t a damn curse, though.” The forty-five-year-old was feverishly tapping his index finger against the steel table as he detailed the tragic circumstances, betraying a lingering frustration in his actions that I imagine may persist for the rest of his sentence, if not for the rest of his life. 

Yuri has another three years to serve. He is more than halfway through his stint for manslaughter, but I’m sure that benchmark is only a meager solace to the bereaved father.  

Halfway through our interview, the familiarity of Yuri’s perceptions and mistakes made a figurative lightning bolt glide down my spine. The whole story reminded me of one of my absolute favorite historical anecdotes - the legend of Spain’s bleeding bread. 

Bear with me through this tangent - I promise the connections will become clear as Yuri’s story unfolds.  

In 1480, the Spanish Inquisition had just started revving its proverbial engines. To briefly review, the aim of the government-ordained inquest was to identify individuals who had publicly converted to Catholicism, but who were also still practicing their previous, now outlawed, religions in secret. On the island of Mallorca, the largest of Spain’s water-locked territories, a local soothsayer would inflame the underlying religious tensions that drove the inquisition to the point of deadly hysteria. Ferrand de Valeria’s prophecy would turn a revving engine into a runaway vehicle.  

At the time, Mallorca was suffering through a small famine. In the grand scheme of things, the famine was mild and manageable, but the lack of resources still resulted in significant anguish. Consumed by zealotry, Ferrand theorized that the ongoing practice of Judaism behind closed doors was the root cause of the famine - divine punishment from the almighty for not driving out the heretics. To that end, he repeatedly warned the townspeople to be vigilant for signs of covertly Jewish individuals taking a barbarous pleasure in “tormenting the body of Christ”. In other words, Ferrand believed that these heretics could be identified if they were caught red-handed with “bleeding bread” (In Catholicism, communion is the belief that bread was/is the body of Christ, so from his prospective, torturing it could cause literal bleeding). He then prophesied the following: if the island ignored the infestation of heretics and the “bleeding bread”, the famine would worsen to the point of their extinction.  

An insane, albeit darkly comedic, proposition - at least by modern standards. However, as it often does, comedy sadly evolved into tragedy given enough time. One of the island’s clergymen was visiting a family of four’s small home. When offered a slice of bread by the mother of the family, he gladly accepted. Despite the ongoing famine, the mother felt that it was critical to still practice Christ-like generosity. Unfortunately, this generosity would only be met with bloodshed, in more ways than one - as she cut into the loaf, the clergyman noticed what appeared to him as a “latent bloodstain”, present on the interior of the bread. He quickly rushed out of the house with Ferrand’s words echoing in his mind. A frenzied, moral panic ensued once the remainder of the island heard about what the clergyman witnessed. Once the panic hit a boiling point, the generous mother, along with her entire family, were wiped out, even though the Inquisition’s subsequent investigation found no evidence of them practicing any religion apart from Catholicism - excluding the bleeding bread, of course. The famine did not abate after their death, and I would imagine it’s no shock to reveal at this point that the bread in the tale did not actually bleed.  

Let that half-complete anecdote simmer in your mind as we review Yuri’s story.  

Yuri Thompson moved to the humble coastal town of Ala’hu in the Spring of 2025, with his son Lee (six years old) and his wife Charlotte (forty-eight years old) in tow. With the earnings from a successful tech startup flooding his back account, Yuri had settled into an early retirement, content with living the rest of his days in a serene, tropical contentment. 

“Our home had been newly developed”, Yuri recalled.  

“We were initially worried about how we’d be received on the island. I mean, Charlotte and I were wealthy tech magnates moving into an estate complex that was otherwise surrounded by more modest costal homes, ones that had been built by the ancestors of the people who lived there, likely with their own hands, upwards of a century ago. But honestly, we were welcomed with open arms, for the most part.” 

With that last sentence, Yuri’s expression darkened - blackened like storm clouds crawling over the horizon.  

He was alluding to Koa Hekekia, the fifty-six-year-old women who had proclaimed the troublesome warning presented at the beginning of the article: 

*”Mark my words - when your children return from the sea, withered and bloodless, may my divination sing softly in your ears until the last, labored breath escapes your lungs. Leave - or die.”*

Koa was the town’s resident Kahuna. In other words, a priestess who made a living through supplying the more superstitious inhabitants of Ala’hu with alternative medicine and religious guidance. Behind closed doors, she would also provide blessings, fortunes, and curses - for the right price, of course.  

“The first time I met Koa, that so-called curse was practically the only thing she said to me” Yuri reflected, with a certain quiet indifference.  

“After the full moon had fallen, the sea would ‘swallow my children, bones and all’. As far she knew, I didn’t have any kids - but she did know that I had moved into one of those estates. I think she viewed us as a threat to her business, like our presence would snuff out the town’s superstition. She was trying to scare us away, or at least make us uncomfortable. I asked my next-door neighbor what he thought of her, and he told me not to worry - that she had threatened him and his two kids when they moved in half a year ago. Many full moons had passed, and they were still happy and healthy.” 

Yuri paused here, breaking eye contact with me. His frenetic tapping had stopped as well.  

“So, I guess I wasn’t worried. At least I didn't let worry show on the outside. I had grown up with a lot of superstitions about hexes and the like from my grandfather and some of my aunts, so internally, it did nag at me a bit. But what was I going to do - move my family back to California because of the ravings from some unhinged loon?” 

“A month after we arrived, Charlotte, Lee and I were spending a day at a local beach. Lee and I were boogie boarding, which he absolutely adored.”

Another pause, longer this time. The air in the room became heavy with emotion, thick and difficult to breathe. After about two minutes passed, Yuri began to speak again: 

“We were catching a wave together, when I noticed blood on my hand. I turned Lee towards me and asked if he was okay. His nose was bleeding, and he looked like he was going to pass out. I tucked him into my chest and swam as quickly as I could to shore” 

By the time EMS arrived, Lee’s heart had stopped - he had seemingly gone into spontaneous cardiac arrest. Despite an hour of CPR, medical professionals were unable to bring Lee back.  

“I don’t think I ever said to myself, in my head or out-loud, that I thought ‘the curse had come true’. Maybe if I did, that would have been enough of a red flag to slow me down - to make me realize I wasn’t thinking clearly. It was more subconscious than that, though. My son died while in the ocean, I vaguely recalled seeing a full moon in the previous few nights, and I had witnessed Lee bleed, which was all in line with what Koa prophesied. The neighbor, the one that had reassured me, also lost a daughter that day. Same thing: cardiac arrest out of the blue while in the ocean. Our collective grief played off each other. When he mentioned he knew where Koa’s shop was, I didn’t have to say anything else. He didn’t have to, either.” 

Our interview ended there. I knew the full story coming into this, so Yuri did not need to rehash the details of that night to me. My understanding of the events was this: after a very brief interrogation, Yuri choked Koa until she lost consciousness, and then proceeded to toss her down a flight of stairs into the shop’s cellar. The trauma of the fall had broken Koa’s neck, killing her in the blink of an eye.  

A total of five people had perished that fateful afternoon - three children and two female adults, all in a manner identical to Lee’s death. When Yuri mentioned that this could have been avoided if he slowed down, I think he may have been right. This wasn’t a pattern of behavior for him - he had no criminal record, and the last proper fight he had been a part of was, per him, in middle school. Not only that, but he had a wildly successful tech career - clearly indicating that he had a rational head on his shoulders. If he had evaluated all the facts, he may have noticed that the circumstances didn’t completely align with Koa’s prophecy. 

The most blaring inconsistency was this: the majority of the people who died did not live in the estates. The two adults and the third child were all born on the island. If they died as a result of said curse, this hex was more like a shotgun than a rife - firing broadly and catching island natives in the crossfire. Not only that, but it had been nine days since the last full moon, not the day directly after a full moon like Koa had detailed.  

Lee’s death, however, made Yuri vulnerable to disregarding inconvenient inconsistencies. The event felt so inherently heinous, and so exceptional in its cruelty, that it needed an answer more narratively satisfactory than dispassionate chance - more powerful than simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Uncaring randomness didn’t carry an equal dramatic weight when compared to the diabolical byproduct of an evil hex.  

Koa, to her detriment, had provided that explanation in advance. But in reality, Lee’s death was simply a result of entropy - an unpredictable consequence of being in the wrong place at the time.  

So, where does the prophecy of the bleeding bread tie into all of this? I’ll let Dr. Tiffany Hall, senior marine biologist out of the University of Miami, clarify the connection:  

“I’ve always loved that story” Dr. Hall said, with a wry, playful smile that quickly morphed into an expression of embarrassment when she realized the potential, out of context implications of that statement.

As an example, review the plotlines of your favorite pieces of media - how many of those stories rely on a “foretold prophecy” to propel their chain of events? I would predict a majority of them do. Even if there isn’t a literal prophecy, how many of those narratives utilize foreshadowing to give the story dramatic resonance once the plot is revealed in full? From *Oedipus* to *Narnia*, the concept of prophecies has always enchanted and captivated us, especially when said prophecy is weaponized against a particular individual or a group of individuals. In other words, a curse- something very much akin to the example listed above, which will serve as the focal point for the narrative I intend to spin.  

The way I see it, this fascination with “the gift of the second sight” is deep-seated within our shared nature. It speaks to us, enthralling our imagination in a way very few other concepts do - but why is that? I believe we treasure the idea of prophecies because their existence implies the presence of a broader narrative playing itself out behind the scenes of our lives, even if we cannot always appreciate it. If the future can be predicted, or even manipulated, then the world may not be as sadistically random and chaotic as it often appears. Prophecies can serve to calm our existential dread by indirectly minimizing our fears regarding the cold entropy of the universe.  

But therein lies the problem - that cultural reverence for prophecies can make even the most rational person susceptible to unfounded, illogical thought. Combine that irrationality with grief and a dash of impulsivity, and the whole thing can become a powder keg waiting to blow.

 A phenomenon that Yuri Thompson can attest to firsthand.  

“I just wasn’t thinking straight” Yuri somberly recounted to me from the inside of Halawa Correctional Facility.  

“In the moment, it connected all the dots - made my son’s death ‘make sense’, so to speak. It felt entirely too cruel to be random. Of course, it wasn’t *actually* random. I mean, there was an explanation to how it happened. Certainly wasn’t a damn curse, though.” The forty-five-year-old was feverishly tapping his index finger against the steel table as he detailed the tragic circumstances, betraying a lingering frustration in his actions that I imagine may persist for the rest of his sentence, if not for the rest of his life. 

Yuri has another three years to serve. He is more than halfway through his stint for manslaughter, but I’m sure that benchmark is only a meager solace to the bereaved father.  

Halfway through our interview, the familiarity of Yuri’s perceptions and mistakes made a figurative lightning bolt glide down my spine. The whole story reminded me of one of my absolute favorite historical anecdotes - the legend of Spain’s bleeding bread. 

Bear with me through this tangent - I promise the connections will become clear as Yuri’s story unfolds.  

In 1480, the Spanish Inquisition had just started revving its proverbial engines. To briefly review, the aim of the government-ordained inquest was to identify individuals who had publicly converted to Catholicism, but who were also still practicing their previous, now outlawed, religions in secret. On the island of Mallorca, the largest of Spain’s water-locked territories, a local soothsayer would inflame the underlying religious tensions that drove the inquisition to the point of deadly hysteria. Ferrand de Valeria’s prophecy would turn a revving engine into a runaway vehicle.  

At the time, Mallorca was suffering through a small famine. In the grand scheme of things, the famine was mild and manageable, but the lack of resources still resulted in significant anguish. Consumed by zealotry, Ferrand theorized that the ongoing practice of Judaism behind closed doors was the root cause of the famine - divine punishment from the almighty for not driving out the heretics. To that end, he repeatedly warned the townspeople to be vigilant for signs of covertly Jewish individuals taking a barbarous pleasure in “tormenting the body of Christ”. In other words, Ferrand believed that these heretics could be identified if they were caught red-handed with “bleeding bread” (In Catholicism, communion is the belief that bread was/is the body of Christ, so from his prospective, torturing it could cause literal bleeding). He then prophesied the following: if the island ignored the infestation of heretics and the “bleeding bread”, the famine would worsen to the point of their extinction.  

An insane, albeit darkly comedic, proposition - at least by modern standards. However, as it often does, comedy sadly evolved into tragedy given enough time. One of the island’s clergymen was visiting a family of four’s small home. When offered a slice of bread by the mother of the family, he gladly accepted. Despite the ongoing famine, the mother felt that it was critical to still practice Christ-like generosity. Unfortunately, this generosity would only be met with bloodshed, in more ways than one - as she cut into the loaf, the clergyman noticed what appeared to him as a “latent bloodstain”, present on the interior of the bread. He quickly rushed out of the house with Ferrand’s words echoing in his mind. A frenzied, moral panic ensued once the remainder of the island heard about what the clergyman witnessed. Once the panic hit a boiling point, the generous mother, along with her entire family, were wiped out, even though the Inquisition’s subsequent investigation found no evidence of them practicing any religion apart from Catholicism - excluding the bleeding bread, of course. The famine did not abate after their death, and I would imagine it’s no shock to reveal at this point that the bread in the tale did not actually bleed.  

Let that half-complete anecdote simmer in your mind as we review Yuri’s story.  

Yuri Thompson moved to the humble coastal town of Ala’hu in the Spring of 2025, with his son Lee (six years old) and his wife Charlotte (forty-eight years old) in tow. With the earnings from a successful tech startup flooding his back account, Yuri had settled into an early retirement, content with living the rest of his days in a serene, tropical contentment. 

“Our home had been newly developed”, Yuri recalled.  

“We were initially worried about how we’d be received on the island. I mean, Charlotte and I were wealthy tech magnates moving into an estate complex that was otherwise surrounded by more modest costal homes, ones that had been built by the ancestors of the people who lived there, likely with their own hands, upwards of a century ago. But honestly, we were welcomed with open arms, for the most part.” 

With that last sentence, Yuri’s expression darkened - blackened like storm clouds crawling over the horizon.  

He was alluding to Koa Hekekia, the fifty-six-year-old women who had proclaimed the troublesome warning presented at the beginning of the article: 

*”Mark my words - when your children return from the sea, withered and bloodless, may my divination sing softly in your ears until the last, labored breath escapes your lungs. Leave - or die.”*

Koa was the town’s resident Kahuna. In other words, a priestess who made a living through supplying the more superstitious inhabitants of Ala’hu with alternative medicine and religious guidance. Behind closed doors, she would also provide blessings, fortunes, and curses - for the right price, of course.  

“The first time I met Koa, that so-called curse was practically the only thing she said to me” Yuri reflected, with a certain quiet indifference.  

“After the full moon had fallen, the sea would ‘swallow my children, bones and all’. As far she knew, I didn’t have any kids - but she did know that I had moved into one of those estates. I think she viewed us as a threat to her business, like our presence would snuff out the town’s superstition. She was trying to scare us away, or at least make us uncomfortable. I asked my next-door neighbor what he thought of her, and he told me not to worry - that she had threatened him and his two kids when they moved in half a year ago. Many full moons had passed, and they were still happy and healthy.” 

Yuri paused here, breaking eye contact with me. His frenetic tapping had stopped as well.  

“So, I guess I wasn’t worried. At least I didn't let worry show on the outside. I had grown up with a lot of superstitions about hexes and the like from my grandfather and some of my aunts, so internally, it did nag at me a bit. But what was I going to do - move my family back to California because of the ravings from some unhinged loon?” 

“A month after we arrived, Charlotte, Lee and I were spending a day at a local beach. Lee and I were boogie boarding, which he absolutely adored.”

Another pause, longer this time. The air in the room became heavy with emotion, thick and difficult to breathe. After about two minutes passed, Yuri began to speak again: 

“We were catching a wave together, when I noticed blood on my hand. I turned Lee towards me and asked if he was okay. His nose was bleeding, and he looked like he was going to pass out. I tucked him into my chest and swam as quickly as I could to shore” 

By the time EMS arrived, Lee’s heart had stopped - he had seemingly gone into spontaneous cardiac arrest. Despite an hour of CPR, medical professionals were unable to bring Lee back.  

“I don’t think I ever said to myself, in my head or out-loud, that I thought ‘the curse had come true’. Maybe if I did, that would have been enough of a red flag to slow me down - to make me realize I wasn’t thinking clearly. It was more subconscious than that, though. My son died while in the ocean, I vaguely recalled seeing a full moon in the previous few nights, and I had witnessed Lee bleed, which was all in line with what Koa prophesied. The neighbor, the one that had reassured me, also lost a daughter that day. Same thing: cardiac arrest out of the blue while in the ocean. Our collective grief played off each other. When he mentioned he knew where Koa’s shop was, I didn’t have to say anything else. He didn’t have to, either.” 

Our interview ended there. I knew the full story coming into this, so Yuri did not need to rehash the details of that night to me. My understanding of the events was this: after a very brief interrogation, Yuri choked Koa until she lost consciousness, and then proceeded to toss her down a flight of stairs into the shop’s cellar. The trauma of the fall had broken Koa’s neck, killing her in the blink of an eye.  

A total of five people had perished that fateful afternoon - three children and two female adults, all in a manner identical to Lee’s death. When Yuri mentioned that this could have been avoided if he slowed down, I think he may have been right. This wasn’t a pattern of behavior for him - he had no criminal record, and the last proper fight he had been a part of was, per him, in middle school. Not only that, but he had a wildly successful tech career - clearly indicating that he had a rational head on his shoulders. If he had evaluated all the facts, he may have noticed that the circumstances didn’t completely align with Koa’s prophecy. 

The most blaring inconsistency was this: the majority of the people who died did not live in the estates. The two adults and the third child were all born on the island. If they died as a result of said curse, this hex was more like a shotgun than a rife - firing broadly and catching island natives in the crossfire. Not only that, but it had been nine days since the last full moon, not the day directly after a full moon like Koa had detailed.  

Lee’s death, however, made Yuri vulnerable to disregarding inconvenient inconsistencies. The event felt so inherently heinous, and so exceptional in its cruelty, that it needed an answer more narratively satisfactory than dispassionate chance - more powerful than simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Uncaring randomness didn’t carry an equal dramatic weight when compared to the diabolical byproduct of an evil hex.  

Koa, to her detriment, had provided that explanation in advance. But in reality, Lee’s death was simply a result of entropy - an unpredictable consequence of being in the wrong place at the time.  

So, where does the prophecy of the bleeding bread tie into all of this? I’ll let Dr. Tiffany Hall, senior marine biologist out of the University of Miami, clarify the connection:  

“I’ve always loved that story” Dr. Hall said, with a wry, playful smile that quickly morphed into an expression of embarrassment when she realized the potential, out of context implications of that statement. 

“I mean I don’t love what happened - that part is horrific. But it is a wonderful example of a supernatural phenomenon becoming biologically explainable, given enough time” 

“*Serratia marcescens* is a species of bacteria that doesn’t intersect with humanity that frequently. It can cause an infection, but only if a person’s immune system is completely non-functional. That being said, it’s pretty abundant in our environment - growing wherever there is available moisture. Hydration is a requirement for the fermentation that allows yeast to become bread, and that moisture allows these bacteria to grow on bread too, almost like a mold. And as it would happen, it expresses a protein called “prodigiosin”, something that gives it a unique quality among other, similar bacteria” 

With a wink, Dr. Hall delivered the punchline: 

“It’s a red pigment - can almost look like a splotch of spilled blood if there is enough bacterial growth.” 

In the end, Mallorca’s famine was simply that - an untimely lack of resources. It wasn’t a punishment inflicted on the island due to the furtive practice of non-catholic religions, nor did the “bleeding bread” have a divine explanation. Ferrand’s prophecy and the subsequent growth of *Serrtia* on that family’s bread was purely a case of unfavorable synchrony. 

Nothing more, nothing less.  

After a brief coffee break, Dr. Hall continued:  

“I heard about the deaths out of Ala’hu right after they happened - the spontaneous cardiac arrests of a few individuals swimming in the same area. I had immediate suspicions about the culprit. When I heard that every person who died was either a child or a smaller-sized adult, my theory was effectively confirmed.” 

“*Carybdea alata* \- more commonly referred to as the Hawaiian Box Jellyfish, was eventually proven to be the killer.” 

Before I had researched this story, I had no idea what in the hell a “box jellyfish” was. But it was an excellent remainder of how unabashedly bizarre and terrifying nature can be when it puts its mind to it.  

No bigger than two inches in size, these tiny devils are known to inhabit the waters in tropical and subtropical regions - most notoriously Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii. Their reproductive form is where they acquired their inappropriately cute nickname: the squishy nervous system above its tentacles has a cuboid shape, looking like a bell or a box. Despite being no bigger than the size of a quarter, when injected through the skin from their tentacles, their poison has the potential to end a person’s life in three minutes or less. 

 “We have no idea why these tiny things are so deadly - I mean we know *how* they are deadly. Their venom can cause an incredibly rapid influx of potassium into someone’s bloodstream, which can very easily make their heart stop - but what I’m trying to say is we don’t know *why* they have evolved to host this uber-potent venom. They certainly don’t have the stomach size to eat what they kill” Dr. Hall chortled endearingly.  

Not only that, but box jellyfish tend to be the most concentrated in coastal waters seven to ten days after a full moon, in-line with their reproductive cycle as well as with the tragic deaths, being nine days after the most recent full moon. Additionally, it is likely that many other people got stung on the day Lee and the other four died - but the more body mass you have, the more the toxin is diluted, which can make the effects less severe and non-life threatening. The children and the two smaller adults likely succumbed to the venom due to their smaller body size. 

“I’ve watched the documentary surrounding Koa’s murder.” 

With this statement, Dr. Hall’s playfulness seemed to ominously evaporate, portending the description of an observation that very noticeably made her uneasy: 

“They showed clips of Yuri’s and Lionel’s (the neighbor who also lost a child) testimonies. What’s so strange is they were both with their kids right before they died, and they both witnessed their kids have a nosebleed directly prior to their cardiac arrest. That’s certainly not an effect of the jellyfish’s venom. It’s probably just a coincidence, I suppose, but it makes me think back to what Koa said - about them ending up bloodless, I mean.” 

I wasn’t sure how to respond to the implication, and I think Dr. Hall could tell.  

“Look at it this way - to my understanding, the media covered the case to no end. All the way from start to finish. If that media spectacle results in less waspy outsiders moving to the Hawaiian Islands out of concern for the potential dangers, then, in a sense, Koa’s prophecy had its intended effect….” she trialed off. I suspect she had more in her head, but she decided against divulging it.  

A forced smile slowly returned to Dr. Hall’s face: 

“I’m sure I’m just seeing connections where they aren’t. It does make you wonder though.” 

Truthfully, I hope she’s right - that she is seeing connections where they aren’t. Most days, I feel confidently that she is. That there was no real connective tissue between Koa and the children's deaths. Some days, however, I could be convinced otherwise. And that small but volatile part of myself - it scares me.

The event felt so inherently heinous, and so exceptional in its cruelty, that it needed an answer more narratively satisfactory than dispassionate chance - more powerful than simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Uncaring randomness didn’t carry an equal dramatic weight when compared to the diabolical byproduct of an evil hex.  

Koa, to her detriment, had provided that explanation in advance. But in reality, Lee’s death was simply a result of entropy - an unpredictable consequence of being in the wrong place at the time.  

So, where does the prophecy of the bleeding bread tie into all of this? I’ll let Dr. Tiffany Hall, senior marine biologist out of the University of Miami, clarify the connection:  

“I’ve always loved that story” Dr. Hall said, with a wry, playful smile that quickly morphed into an expression of embarrassment when she realized the potential, out of context implications of that statement. 

“I mean I don’t love what happened - that part is horrific. But it is a wonderful example of a supernatural phenomenon becoming biologically explainable, given enough time” 

“*Serratia marcescens* is a species of bacteria that doesn’t intersect with humanity that frequently. It can cause an infection, but only if a person’s immune system is completely non-functional. That being said, it’s pretty abundant in our environment - growing wherever there is available moisture. Hydration is a requirement for the fermentation that allows yeast to become bread, and that moisture allows these bacteria to grow on bread too, almost like a mold. And as it would happen, it expresses a protein called “prodigiosin”, something that gives it a unique quality among other, similar bacteria” 

With a wink, Dr. Hall delivered the punchline: 

“It’s a red pigment - can almost look like a splotch of spilled blood if there is enough bacterial growth.” 

In the end, Mallorca’s famine was simply that - an untimely lack of resources. It wasn’t a punishment inflicted on the island due to the furtive practice of non-catholic religions, nor did the “bleeding bread” have a divine explanation. Ferrand’s prophecy and the subsequent growth of *Serrtia* on that family’s bread was purely a case of unfavorable synchrony. 

Nothing more, nothing less.  

After a brief coffee break, Dr. Hall continued:  

“I heard about the deaths out of Ala’hu right after they happened - the spontaneous cardiac arrests of a few individuals swimming in the same area. I had immediate suspicions about the culprit. When I heard that every person who died was either a child or a smaller-sized adult, my theory was effectively confirmed.” 

“*Carybdea alata* \- more commonly referred to as the Hawaiian Box Jellyfish, was eventually proven to be the killer.” 

Before I had researched this story, I had no idea what in the hell a “box jellyfish” was. But it was an excellent remainder of how unabashedly bizarre and terrifying nature can be when it puts its mind to it.  

No bigger than two inches in size, these tiny devils are known to inhabit the waters in tropical and subtropical regions - most notoriously Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii. Their reproductive form is where they acquired their inappropriately cute nickname: the squishy nervous system above its tentacles has a cuboid shape, looking like a bell or a box. Despite being no bigger than the size of a quarter, when injected through the skin from their tentacles, their poison has the potential to end a person’s life in three minutes or less. 

 “We have no idea why these tiny things are so deadly - I mean we know *how* they are deadly. Their venom can cause an incredibly rapid influx of potassium into someone’s bloodstream, which can very easily make their heart stop - but what I’m trying to say is we don’t know *why* they have evolved to host this uber-potent venom. They certainly don’t have the stomach size to eat what they kill” Dr. Hall chortled endearingly.  

Not only that, but box jellyfish tend to be the most concentrated in coastal waters seven to ten days after a full moon, in-line with their reproductive cycle as well as with the tragic deaths, being nine days after the most recent full moon. Additionally, it is likely that many other people got stung on the day Lee and the other four died - but the more body mass you have, the more the toxin is diluted, which can make the effects less severe and non-life threatening. The children and the two smaller adults likely succumbed to the venom due to their smaller body size. 

“I’ve watched the documentary surrounding Koa’s murder.” 

With this statement, Dr. Hall’s playfulness seemed to ominously evaporate, portending the description of an observation that very noticeably made her uneasy: 

“They showed clips of Yuri’s and Lionel’s (the neighbor who also lost a child) testimonies. What’s so strange is they were both with their kids right before they died, and they both witnessed their kids have a nosebleed directly prior to their cardiac arrest. That’s certainly not an effect of the jellyfish’s venom. It’s probably just a coincidence, I suppose, but it makes me think back to what Koa said - about them ending up bloodless, I mean.” 

I wasn’t sure how to respond to the implication, and I think Dr. Hall could tell.  

“Look at it this way - to my understanding, the media covered the case to no end. All the way from start to finish. If that media spectacle results in less waspy outsiders moving to the Hawaiian Islands out of concern for the potential dangers, then, in a sense, Koa’s prophecy had its intended effect….” she trialed off. I suspect she had more in her head, but she decided against divulging it.  

A forced smile slowly returned to Dr. Hall’s face: 

“I’m sure I’m just seeing connections where they aren’t. It does make you wonder though.” 

Truthfully, I hope she’s right - that she is seeing connections where they aren’t. Most days, I feel confidently that she is. That there was no real connective tissue between Koa and the children's deaths. Some days, however, I could be convinced otherwise. And that small but volatile part of myself - it scares me.

Hi, 
I opened a coffee shop (real Café, not the brokkoli coffee shop ;-) ) including a roastery for years ago. I had a vision and out a lot of dedicated work into that. Now, four years later the roastery and coffee shop are well known in town, plus there is a really good brand awareness towards the brand of the roastery. 
I'm making 100.000€ turnover per month. But the monthly profit of the whole thing is -10.000€/month. 
Biggest cost factor is salaries. We are paying fair salary and fair prices to the coffee producers and don't want to change that, no matter what. 

I've tried to reduce staff, made the prices of our products higher, looking for new customers (we are selling our product also to hotels and similar) in every free minute. I had a big investor investing in the company for a part of it, so I'm able to carry the monthly loss for some month more, but than it's game over. 
I'm not an very experienced entrepreneur, I'm overwhelmed with the situation (feeling I have to watch for myself to not go into personal burnout) and I'm not sure where to go from this point on or where to look for new ideas. 
Is there general advice for my situation or maybe some insights from other entrepreneur who have been in a similar situation?",1,1732806944.0,Entrepreneur,9,1.0,False

Bruh the game Stalker is hell. The second u peek around a wall, door, or window, these NPCs are cross-mapping u with an SMG or shotgun while bum rushing u like maniacs with no sense of self-preservation. The game feels like it’s actively sabotaging u. Ur aim is shakier than a drunk at last call, and ur guy can’t hold his breath longer than a YouTube ad. Stealth is pointless. U could be hiding in a bush at night, 500 feet away, and they’ll still spot u instantly, laying down suppressive fire and chucking grenades like Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl. And if u somehow manage to stealth kill someone, the whole map feels a disturbance in the Force and immediately knows u did it and exactly where u are.

Ur armor and weapons are basically made of wet tissue paper and cost more to fix than a down payment on a used car. The barter system is a joke. It’s like walking into Pawn Stars with a diamond necklace, and Rick lowballs u with, “Best I can do is five bucks and a coffee mug.” Meanwhile, ur character is as strong as a noodle left soaking for an hour, breaks a sweat just picking up a spoon, and can’t carry more than a pocketful of loot before collapsing. And on top of it all, ur getting relentlessly bullied by mutants who teleport behind u like they’ve got admin privileges and a personal vendetta.

TLDR: This game is brutal. NPCs have near perfect accuracy, stealth doesn’t work, and enemies always know where u are. Ur gear breaks easily and costs too much to fix, the barter system gives u nothing, ur character is weak, and enemies constantly spawn behind u.",3,1732806885.0,stalker,19,0.59,False

Last Sunday, I had a disappointing experience at Muji.

I showed them the receipt and email confirmation from Seabank that verified the transaction was successful. After waiting for 20 minutes, they still insisted they needed that text confirmation. Considering how large of a company you are, don’t you have any alternative methods to verify that a transaction was successful instead of relying on a message from an outdated, malfunctioning phone from the 2000s? We had planned to watch a movie that day, so you can imagine the stress we were experiencing. Not wanting to waste any more time, we decided to get coffee first. When we returned to Muji, the cashier was nowhere to be found, and we had to ask someone to summon her. After nearly an hour, they informed me that they still hadn’t received any messages. I think the cashier noticed my frustration, so she simply took a picture of the email and receipt and allowed me to leave. She even apologized, but I didn’t respond and just looked at her without any expression.

It went great and it wasn’t anything super crazy just met up for coffee for an hour. With the holidays this week and with her work schedule i couldn’t take her on a 2nd date but I’ll see if next week works. So anyways since that first date we’ve been texting back and forth however I feel like I’m doing a little too much with texting. It’s just whenever the convo would seem like it’s ending I would to continue it since I have this fear of being boring to her. Her recent replies have been less so I’ll obviously take it easy on the texting. I’m just pissed that I might’ve been too much and ruined my shot. ,1,1732805939.0,dating,2,0.99,False

The only cardio I do is walking back and forth at work, to the store and gym while I'm at work.

I RARELY can eat three. I consume nicotine which I suppose is not helping and I either stay skinny or get skinnier. This seems like it's more people's wish but I feel less sexy to men when I'm skinny, less sexually desirable and people gawk at skinny people saying we got too skinny and need to eat more when we're eating g a lot it's very stressful. Does anyone have a diet that's helped with this. I feel it has to be more structured rather than me trying g to add as much calories as possible this way when I don't feel like eating due to depression it's just a routine I need to follow. I drink a lot of sweetened coffee and try to get calories through protein, protein shakes, protein bars, smoothies. The only time I ever was able to gain healthy weight are times I COMPLETELY cut cardio, wasn't working like during quarantine and a time I was on FMLA leave. Stress also doesn't help at all. I'm not happy in life AT ALL and that makes it really hard to keep healthy weight on. People are VERY mean to me when I'm thinner.

1h1xnwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h1xnwp/ny_driver_makes_a_strange_deal_with_a_businessman/, NY Driver Makes a Strange Deal With a Businessman (Part1) ,"Luke sucks at soccer. I have to admit it. I know as a dad that is a terrible thing to say. But it is the truth.

My eight year old son is much better at math than running about dribbling the ball on the pitch. But he has the time of his life every time he steps on the soccer field. His enthusiasm, often rubbing off on his teammates and, many times, even the coach.

Whether it is a practice session during the weekdays or a game on the weekends, Luke gives it his all, even if the end result is not to his liking.

And today would be a good example of that.

His team the Trailblazers got their behinds razed in typical lawn mower fashion with a 0-7 drubbing.

While Luke secretly likes to address himself and his teammates as ‘Messi’s Boys’, the game today was messy alright, just like it had been all year round. The kids are yet to open their account this season.

But I honestly didn’t mind. I was just happy to see my son pursue something with passion.

While he did sit and brood at the end of each game, it never dampened the zest he had for life. And the losses only made him more determined.

  So, it has become customary for me to treat a sulking Luke to an ice cream at his favorite joint after every Sunday game, where he would sit and go over the game specifics, in the hopes that a change of tactics would somehow lead to a change of outcome in the next.

His attention however changed midway when he suddenly spotted a large limousine stop at a construction site nearby.

“Dad, do you drive one of those?” he asked, his gaze fixed on the car while he slowly licked his ice cream.  

I wasn’t surprised at the question since I worked as a driver for a car rental agency. But we no longer had those stretch limousines at our shop anymore. Its popularity had waned over the years, and a lot of travelling businessmen now find them tacky to use in the New York financial circles at least.

“No buddy. But your grandpa did. In fact, he used to pick me up from school in that car often, and we used to go on long drives.” I said.

“I would like to travel in that too someday”, Luke replied back, his eyes still fixed on the car.

“Well, maybe you can take your date to prom in that thing in a few years. Hopefully you will learn to kiss a girl before that,” I said teasingly, while Luke shrivelled his nose in mock disgust.

The sight of the limousine however stirred up mixed feelings in me. My dad, Henry Pritchard walked out of my life when I was 10 years old. I remember it vividly even today. He approached me one day and announced that he was traveling abroad for a little while. He emphasized that I was to be the man of the house until his return, and instructed me to take good care of Mom in his absence.

When he picked up his suitcase and left the apartment, I ran to my room to look through the window that overlooked the driveway. There, I saw a large red-colored limousine parked out in front.

Dad approached the car and then turned around to look at me. He knew I would be watching him from behind the curtains. He simply raised his hands and waved at me one last time before entering the car. I never saw or heard from him again.

 My thoughts were suddenly interrupted when I felt my phone ring in my pocket, it was from my Boss Gary Mehicus.

“Hey Matt, we got a new booking today. Big fish by the looks of it. He’s booked us for the whole month. Insisted on you being the wheelman, said you came highly recommended. You think you can handle it for the entire time?” he asked me.

 “Sure Boss. Just tell me when and where,” I responded.

“Great. Take good care of him Matt. He might just tip you a sack of gold” Gary said laughing. ”Oh, and take Roy out for a spin” he added, before ending the call.

Roy, a custom-ordered Rolls Royce Phantom, is our best car at the rental agency. He is reserved exclusively for our top clients.

Gary and I visited the manufacturers and spent a few of days meticulously selecting every detail for Roy, from Arctic white leather seats to discreet bullet-proofing, wood veneers to upholstery, and every other amenity to achieve the best blend luxury and security.

Gary and I go back a long way. In fact, he was best friends with my dad, and they both used to work for the same rental agency. Gary is also my godfather, and when my dad went missing, he went the extra mile to fill the void in my life.

I developed a rebellious streak in my early teens, angry that dad had abandoned me and mom as a family.

For the first few months after his disappearance, I made it a point to peek at the window every day, sometimes for hours, hoping he would eventually turn up—a habit that never stopped and still continues subconsciously to this day, although I know better now.

However, back then, it eventually turned to anger, and Mom had a difficult time controlling me as a kid.

My grades started falling, I would randomly pick fights with children in school, and I even tried my luck being an errand boy for drug peddlers in my neighborhood. Gary had to intervene and introduced me to his love for baseball and driving.

He took me on long drives once every month for an entire year, and showed me around the countryside. It felt like a soothing balm for the wounded soul.

But my happiest moment came when I was in attendance at the stadium with Gary, and Tino Martinez’s grand slam of '98 unfolded right in front of my eyes. We all went delirious with joy in the stadium, as I found myself hugging and celebrating with random strangers. That experience changed my life and I emerged transformed as a person.

Gary also obtained a signed jersey and cap from the players during his time chauffeuring them on tours, presenting it to me as a birthday gift. It remains my most prized possession.

So when he started his own rental agency, I decided to join him as soon as I was finished with school, and have been working for him ever since.

My own childhood experiences motivated me to be the best dad I could be to my son. Since his mother was no longer with us, I always went the extra mile to ensure he had a supportive and loving environment.

I also tried to inculcate in Luke my love for driving and baseball, but the kid gravitated towards soccer. Fortunately, we still do share a common love for cars, and he always looks forward to long drives on weekends.

My mind got diverted again when I heard my phone beep, Gary had just sent me the details about the next client.

I dropped Luke at home and went to the office garage to take Roy out for a spin.

 A couple of hours later, I arrived at the address I had received on my phone. Situated a little bit on the outskirts of the city, I got there half an hour ahead of time.

I parked my car near a diner and noticed a large man standing by the entrance.

Dressed in a perfectly tailored pinstripe suit, he appeared to be in his early fifties, around 6’4"" in height, with broad shoulders and a heavy set build. His salt-and-pepper hair was slicked back, and his beard was neatly trimmed. He casually smoked a cigar while holding a walking stick in his other hand, adorned with a prominent goat-shaped carving at the top.

""Mr. Thomas Devlin?"" I inquired as I stepped out of the car. He nodded, extending his hand while clenching the cigar in his mouth.

""And you must be Matt?"" he declared, with a booming baritone voice. I could see a couple of gold teeth glint in the dark as he flashed a warm smile.

""Yes Sir. I'm Matt Prichard, your chauffeur for the evening. I hope I haven't kept you waiting?"" I inquired, feeling a tinge of embarrassment, despite being ahead of schedule.

“No young man. I usually like to stretch my legs and enjoy a cigar after a fine meal’” he said pointing to the diner behind him. Mr. Devlin looked a peculiar sight in this neighborhood, especially with the diner in the backdrop. 

Everything about him screamed money, so it did make me wonder why someone of his affluence would choose to visit this place, at this hour. But I could also sense an undeniable toughness in him, the kind of man who probably started from the bottom and had to work his way up the ladder.

A few minutes later, Mr. Devlin suggested we hit the road, and I promptly opened the car door, allowing him to ease into the backseat.

When I took my position behind the wheel, he handed me a gold card, which was the size of a normal government ID but much thicker.

It had a Trident symbol embossed on both ends. As I looked at it confused, he told me to simply place it on the GPS screen. I did as I was told, and the navigation system immediately sprang to life, displaying a new set of coordinates.

Mr Devlin realized my lingering confusion as I continued to stare at the card that was stuck to the screen.

“Probably a hidden chip embedded in that thing,” he joked from the backseat, his teeth glinting as I looked in the rear view mirror.

I quickly nodded in acknowledgment and began driving.

As we navigated through the city, Mr. Devlin shared that he was based out of Chicago and was currently in the city for a new business venture. He was not much of a conversationalist but instead showed more interest in my life, inquiring about my job and family.

It struck me as somewhat unusual for a businessman of his stature to delve into a chauffeur's experiences. He particularly relished the humorous stories I recounted revolving Luke, often breaking into a smile.

While chauffeurs typically have anecdotes ready on hand for bored clients, Mr. Devlin appeared genuinely intrigued by my life, almost as if, he was using it as an opportunity to evaluate me.

The navigation system then finally beeped to signal the arrival of the location, and a newly opened grand hotel loomed just a few feet away.

“Sir your card,” I said, as I retrieved the gold card from the screen and turned around in my seat to hand it to him.

Mr. Devlin said, “Keep it, Matt; it's your tip for the evening.”

“Don’t worry, it's genuine,” he chuckled as he noticed me glancing at the gold card a little longer than necessary. “And consider it a ticket, not a card,” he clarified.

Mr. Devlin then fell silent for a moment, remaining seated in contemplation as he gazed in my direction before resuming to speak again.

“Matt, I have a proposition for you? Would you be interested in hearing me out?” he suddenly asked me.

“Sure Mr Devlin, what do you have in mind?” I responded.

“I am looking for a driver I can rely on. Your name came recommended from a former client of yours whose judgment I trust. I was told that you are good at your job, professional, always on time, know your way around the city, and that you are discreet about the clients you chauffeur. Would you accept that as an accurate assessment of yourself?” he asked.

“Yes Sir. That would be correct” I replied back.

“Good. So here is what I have in mind. I need you to chauffeur my clients for the next 30 days. The details of the pick-up will be texted to your phone every day at 7:00 PM sharp. All you have to do is pick them up and drop them at the coordinates provided to you. That is all. Nothing more. Similar to how it happened between us today. A gold ticket will be given to you at the start of each drop, and that would be your payment for services rendered.""

“I hope I have been clear thus far?” he stopped midway to ask me. I simply nodded back.

“Excellent. Now, I have 3 conditions you need to religiously adhere to. One, if you agree to take on this job, you cannot walk out midway. You need to see it through.”

“Two, under no circumstances are you to participate or involve yourself in whatever activity the passengers may be engaged in. Your job is to solely chauffeur them, and once you have dropped them at the designated location, you are to return back. There is no need for you to wait to pick them up again. “

“Three, you have to be discreet about this job, which means nobody else can know about it. That would include your boss or any other colleagues in your agency.”

“These are the only three rules you need to follow. Furthermore, payment to your company has already been settled in full for the proposed deal's duration, covering fuel costs and exclusively booking your services as a driver. So, you do not have to worry about other commitments either. I need you to concentrate solely on the job at hand. Are we clear?” he asked, pausing again to await my response.

I nodded in understanding, although I was beginning to get wary about what was on offer. The more the man spoke, the more I began to wonder if I would be getting into some kind of trouble.

“Sir, I need to ask. Does this job involve any dealings with the grey areas of the law?” I inquired delicately. 

My Devlin paused for a moment before speaking. “Maybe, maybe not. But I can assure you this. You will not get into any kind of legal trouble. I trust you have been a chauffeur long enough to know when to look the other way. Treat this job like any other, and you'll be just fine,"" he said in a matter of fact manner.

I still felt a sense of unease over the entire thing and started slowly shaking my head when Mr Devlin said, “Look, Matt, there's no need to rush your decision. If your answer is no, just keep it to yourself for now and you can simply text me your decision tomorrow. My suggestion to you is to take the night to mull things over. It's good easy money you can make in a month. You can probably use it to buy something nice for your kid.  However, there is no pressure from my side. Your employer will not receive bad feedback from me, if you choose to reject this offer. So, I’ll leave it entirely up to you.” he added, reassuringly.

I nodded back at him smiling, grateful that he was open and direct with me.

“Alright then. I guess it’s time to get back on my feet” he said, as he prepared to exit from the car. I quickly got out of the vehicle to open the door for him.

Mr Devlin shook hands with me and started his walk to the hotel. I saw him slowly climb up those stairs and enter through the doors of the newly built Trident Regency hotel.

The following day, just like I was told, I received a text on my phone at 7:00 PM sharp. It gave the location of the pick-up, and also reminded me to be on time.

I sat down and looked at the gold ticket that was lying on my bedside table. Picking it up, I examined it closely, feeling its weight in my hand as I patted it on my palm. It’s certainly worth a considerable chunk of money, especially if I was to come in possession of another 30 of them.

Plus, the elegantly embossed ruby encrusted trident on both sides of the card was only going to add to its value.

On one hand, I had a bad feeling about this, knowing full well the client from last night could be involved in a questionable line of work. But I also saw this as an opportunity to make some quick money.

It was only a month-long gig, requiring a few hours of driving each day.  I could easily be making 2-3 times my annual salary within that time frame. Maybe even more, once I get to know exactly how much these cards are worth.

‘I mean how bad could it really get?’, I asked myself, when I really thought about it. 

I might probably be required to drive people to an illegal gambling joint, or take a VIP client to visit his favorite hooker in the middle of the night. Nobody is going to hire a premium car service to indulge in petty crime, I reasoned.

My eyes then shifted toward my son Luke, who was immersed in his studies. He was busy tackling a new math problem, and that made me break into a smile. He was probably the only kid in the world who liked the idea of homework. Give him a few books that pique his interest and he needs to be constantly reminded to eat.

‘Maybe I could sell the tickets and deposit the proceeds in a bank. Leave it untouched for a few years, letting it slowly collect interest over time. And when Luke gets older, the money could come in handy to pay for college,’ I thought

The more I contemplated, the more I wanted to take on this job. So I replied back saying that I would be there. I got ready and dressed, and was out the door in twenty minutes.

Before leaving, I reached out to my regular babysitter, Jennifer, who lives with her family on the same floor in the apartment just next to ours. She is very fond of Luke and agrees to keep an eye on him whenever I am away for work

I got into my car and instructed little Roy to be on his best behaviour for the night. Starting the car, I rolled out of my apartment building toward my pick-up point.

Upon reaching the venue, my attention was immediately drawn to a man dressed in a clown outfit with a duffle bag slung across his shoulder. When our eyes met, I realized that he was my fare for the night, the designated passenger I was meant to pick up.

The clown opened the door and sat in the back seat. He reached into his jacket and handed me his ticket. I could see his knuckles were bruised, giving me the impression he was involved in some kind of brawl recently.

‘Great start Matt!!’, I thought to myself.

I received the ticket from him and placed it on the GPS screen and it immediately started relaying a new set of coordinates. The odd thing with this arrangement is that it doesn’t reveal the destination beforehand.

Instead all you get are directions for the next 50 meters ahead of you. The blue line on the screen updates only as much as the movement your car makes while driving.

I thought the whole thing was a little bizarre, but the ticket was doing its magic, dangling itself like a carrot in front of me every time I tried to wrestle with reason.

 I quickly glanced at the rear view mirror to take a look at my passenger.

He looked tired and worn out, and was resting his head on the headrest, trying to grab a quick shut eye.  Despite the heavy makeup, his face bore visible wounds.

Even by clown standards, I thought his outfit was unusual and odd. Instead of the rainbow coloured wig, he was wearing a wavy white one, reminiscent of those Barristers in British courts. There was also a white neck band jutting out of his outfit that people usually associate with lawyers.

‘What is this guy upto?’ I quietly asked myself, as the clown simply rested in the back seat of the car, whistling softly while tapping his finger rhythmically on his duffle bag, like he was getting ready to put on a show.

A couple of minutes later, the system beeped abruptly to signal the arrival of a certain Roza pharmacy, which was located on the opposite side of the road.

The clown thanked me for the ride and stepped out of the car. He stretched himself for a second and then opened his duffle bag to remove a bugle. He dug his right hand into his pocket to retrieve a knuckle buster and put it on.

The oncoming traffic suddenly came to a standstill, to make way for the clown as he crossed the road playing his bugle and twirling his arm raised in the air. The commuters cursed him as they passed by, but he remained unfazed and continued moving forward.

The clown then rolled his hand into a fist, and pointed it at the guy working behind the counter in the pharmacy, to signal him of his imminent arrival.

The employee just stared back from the storefront window, his face had gone white and he immediately bent down to probably reach for a gun, but the clown was prepared and suddenly took off into a sprint.

He threw away the bugle and rushed into the pharmacy, catching the customers inside by surprise. The employee by this time had retrieved a shotgun but only just barely, as the clown caught him by the collar of his shirt and banged his head against the counter. He then dragged the hapless employee to his side of the shop and yanked the shotgun away from his grasp.

The clown aimed the shotgun in the air and fired it once, suggesting to the customers that they would be wise to flee.

He then aimed the weapon directly at the employee’s face as he waited for the people to scram.

I could see him speaking something animatedly to the employee but I was too far away to pick up any of it. Once the people had cleared out, he emptied the shotgun and threw it behind the counter.

The clown then picked the employee off the ground and started raining punches on the poor guy. I watched in both horror and amazement as he caught hold of the guy’s shirt and started pushing him forcefully.

They both rammed themselves into the storefront window, shattering it and spilling onto the pavement.

The clown swiftly rose to his feet and began pummelling the employee again who lay sprawled on the sidewalk.

Each time he raised his knuckle-buster-fitted hand in the air, he looked skyward, as if inquiring with the Gods above, ' ‘Are you happy? Is this enough?’ before delivering another crushing blow.

And he kept repeating it again and again.

 The cars on the road just sped past him, momentarily blocking my view of the event from unfolding, reminiscent of a flickering tubelight illuminating a dark space in momentary bursts.

And when the clown’s fist did make contact, it was like a streak of lightning determinedly hitting its intended target. I watched the whole thing completely transfixed, unable to move mind or muscle.

I jolted back to my senses only when a large vehicle suddenly parked itself in front of the pharmacy, completely blocking my view. Up until then, it felt as if I had been in a trance. I immediately started my car and sped off.

As I continued driving, my mind struggled to even recollect if the vehicle on scene was a patrol car or an ambulance or simply, another taxi.

The surreal nature of the encounter left me unsettled, questioning the motives and actions of the unpredictable clown.

Despite driving in circles for the next twenty minutes, I eventually found myself back at the exact spot where I had left Mr. Devlin the previous night.

I brought the car to a stop but kept the engine running while I continued to stare at the newly built Trident Regency hotel, located a mere 20 metres away from me.

‘Maybe I should head up those stairs and meet Mr Devlin, and communicate to him in person that I am not interested in this job anymore. Or I could just ask my boss Gary to cancel the order. He would definitely understand if I said the gig was risky and wouldn’t probe me for details.’

Every instinct in me warned that I should pack my bags and lay low for a while. On any given day, I would have done just that. But I felt something awaken in me when I saw that clown in the pharmacy, and I couldn’t understand what it was.

I hadn’t felt this alive in years and I struggled to shake it off.

At the same time, I could also sense an overwhelming cacophony of contradictory voices in my head simultaneously coming to life - each fighting the other to gain the upper hand on who gets to dictate my future course of action.

 

*‘So what are you waiting for Matt? You saw the clown at work, how he went to town and made the world his own circus. How much more of a warning do you need?’*

 *‘But you have a deal to honor here ,Matt, and you have a duty to see it through. You didn’t hurt anybody. You did nothing wrong here. The clown would have gone through with his plan anyway, even if you hadn’t taken up this job.’*

*‘Oh, so this is how we're going to rationalize the events of this evening, are we? Would you consider taking a job knowing you'd be driving for smugglers dealing in stolen body parts? Or offering your services to a group that kidnaps kids as they return home from school?*

 *‘These are extreme examples Matt, and are being dished out to screw with your head. Don’t overthink this. The world isn’t a fair place. We all know that. Sometimes we got to make the best use of the opportunities that come our way. Remember, you have a kid you need to take care of. You have seen how smart Luke is. He could be a doctor  or an engineer someday. How else are you going to arrange the money for his college tuition? You swore to yourself the day you held Luke in your arms for the first time, you would be present in his life and not abandon him, like your father did to you.’*

*‘Wooow. This is low even for you ,Matt, to drag your father and kid in a mess of your own making. Did you ever stop to consider that you can land in prison over this? If day 1 could be this dramatic, what do you think will follow in the days to come? Are you planning on becoming the best father of the year from behind bars, while your kid grows up in foster care? Do you think the little bookworm can survive the bullying from kids twice his size? Why don’t you just admit it Matt, that you liked what you saw back there, and that somewhere deep within you, there is a flaw in your moral character…’*

I shut down the car and closed my eyes, resting my forehead on the steering wheel, trying to desperately filter out all the noise. I took deep long breaths as I tried to steady my mind. A little while later, I leaned back in my seat, and attempted to think things through again from scratch.

‘One night. Just one more night,’ I decided finally. ‘And if things don’t change for the better, we are calling it quits no matter what’, I said to myself a few minutes later.

I started the car again and raced home to get ready for the next day.

When the clock struck 7 the next day, I was already sitting in my car and started the vehicle immediately to get to the location.

While approaching the pick-up point, I spotted a solitary, tall figure near a bus stand in the distance.  Upon getting closer, I discovered that my passenger for the night was none other than Batman.

As I stopped my car and looked across the window, I saw the man’s cape fluttering gracefully in the wind, casting a dramatic silhouette against the backdrop of the city’s skyline. Batman then opened the door and sat in the backseat of my car.

“Gotham city?” I asked, looking into the rear view mirror offering half a smile.

I knew my feeble attempt at humor was not going to cut it with him, but I needed to assess the new customer, if I was to somehow try and prevent a repeat of last night.

“Somebody is getting real comfortable,” Batman growled back with a scowl, while handing me the golden ticket he held in his hand.

He then leaned back and looked at the road ahead in silence.

I placed the card on the navigation system and started driving, deciding to remain quiet for the remainder of the journey.

As the minutes passed, the man masquerading as Batman slowly began to exude a certain kind of warmth, almost reluctant to admit he was having a decent time.

A wry smile even appeared on his face as he relaxed to the rhythm of New York’s evening traffic, silently observing people go about their daily lives.

From friends laughing at each other’s jokes in the side-lines to people enjoying a quiet meal at a bistro to commuters getting involved in heated disputes with one another to lovers simply sitting on a bench holding hands - he soaked it all in, with a quiet sense of detachment.

I inwardly heaved a huge sigh of relief.

Hopefully, Batman won’t just suddenly barge out of the car, mid traffic, chasing after gangsters in a deserted alley. I also turned on the radio to play some music to further soothe the atmosphere.

And in a matter of minutes, both Batman and I were bobbing our heads, slowly jiving to the beat of a soaring jazz number. Though I had no idea about who the artist was, I could somehow feel the lingering edge from last night slowly wearing off, when suddenly, I was distracted by a beep from my navigation system.

I figured we had finally reached our destination and I gently slowed down the car to a halt.

But my heart began to race again, when I realized I had stopped the vehicle just outside a police station.

Before I could utter another word, Batman was already out the door.

“Keep the engine running,” he said, without looking back as he crossed the road to get to the police station.

I saw two police officers standing outside the precinct, drinking coffee and looking engrossed in conversation.

Their attention quickly turned towards the caped crusader, as he gently bowed his head while walking past them, offering also a quick two finger salute that caused both officers to break into a grin.

One of the policemen then looked in my direction, winking and smiling at me, as if signalling to mention the arrival of this week’s ‘weirdo’ amongst our midst.

‘SHIT…….SHIT ……..SHIT’ I cursed to myself, kicking my feet around in the car while pretending to smile back at the officer.

A policeman had spotted me, and the last thing I needed right now was to spend a night in a jail cell.

And I can say with certainty that this version of Batman is not looking to pay a courtesy visit to his ‘old pal’ Gordon.

I kept the engine running, with my hands tightly gripping the steering wheel, wondering if I should just quietly drive away. But my body had already frozen and a part of me actually wanted to wait and see what was going to happen, and that scared me even the more.

I scanned the surrounding buildings looking for cameras and to my dismay, I found them everywhere. It felt like they had been specifically installed just to keep an eye on me.

Then when I looked across the road to steal a glance at the precinct again, I found the same officer staring at me while his buddy was busy answering a phone call.

He had a curious look on his face, as if he was trying to connect the dots to a possible problem.

I suddenly felt a pit form in my stomach, when I heard loud noises emanate from the police building behind him. The screams of people echoed through the air, as unknown objects crashed and shattered to the floor.

The officer briefly glanced back before fixing his gaze on my panic-stricken face. Finally connecting the dots, he pointed his hand at me, looked me in the eye, and sternly yelled, “STAY!”

Soon after, gunshots also echoed from within the precinct. Both officers swiftly drew their weapons and charged toward the police building, guns pointed forward.

And everything began to unfold in slow motion from that very moment before my own eyes.

As they reached for the door, a colossal ball of fire erupted from the building, obliterating everything in its path. The explosion sent shockwaves, tearing the two mens' bodies to shreds.

One officer's head soared 20 metres in the air, landing on the bonnet of my car before bouncing off to hit the lamppost adjacent to me, and finally settling in the dead space between my car and the vehicle in front.

It belonged to the policeman who had smiled at me only a minute earlier and now his haunting lifeless gaze sent me into a panicked frenzy.  I quickly put the gear in reverse, only to hit the car parked behind me, setting off its siren.

My senses suddenly snapped back to real time. It was as if the clock had been sped up, and I finally started to experience the full chaotic atmosphere around me. The branches of the trees around the precinct had caught fire, the sirens of multiple cars blared in unison while the people nearby were scared shitless and ducking helplessly for cover.

I quickly tried to compose myself before turning on the ignition again and tried to swerve to the right as much as possible, to avoid the car from running over the severed head in front. But I wound up chipping it from the side causing the head to roll over inwards and catch the full impact of my rear wheel. Wincing in disgust, I struggled to steady my trembling hands while gripping the steering wheel.

“FUCK!!” I yelled out loud, once I had cleared a couple of blocks and when the nerves began to finally settle.

 I could already see visions of the police breaking into my home and cuffing my hands in front of my kid.

‘What is going to happen to my son? He’s got no one else in this world’, I thought to myself, my mind fraught with worry. 

I drove around the city aimlessly for the next 20 minutes, contemplating the increasing likelihood of my own incarceration.

Going to the police on my own accord made no sense, they wouldn’t believe my story anyway. I’d probably be tagged as an accomplice to the crime and, honestly, that wouldn’t surprise me. The cops can be ruthless when their own safety is under threat.

Then there was Mr Devilin himself and that wretched deal of his that I also needed to sit and worry about. Surely, I am not going to go through with the rest of it now, and he is not going to be pleased over it either.

So I thought it would best to probably lay low for a while until this all blew over.  I ditched my cell and stopped at a convenience store along the way to get a new burner phone.

When I reached my apartment at last, I immediately stuffed some clothes in a bag. Gently, I woke Luke up and helped him get dressed quickly. Together, we sat in the car and headed for Philly, where I planned to crash at a friend’s place for a couple of days before considering my next move. Eric Gunther, an old high school buddy, had moved to Philadelphia for work a few years back, so reaching out to him seemed like a good idea.

By the time I reached Eric’s home, it was already 4 in the morning. He was surprised to see me at his doorstep, with Luke sound asleep and resting on my shoulder, and immediately knew I was in some kind of trouble. He ushered me in and cleared the spare room for the two of us.

Eric and I agreed to get some rest first, and talk things over in the morning.

After gently laying Luke down on the bed without waking him, I settled into a rocking chair nearby.  As I leaned back, the exhaustion washed over me, and I immediately drifted to sleep.

When I woke up, it took me a moment to realize I was still at Eric’s place. I checked my watch, it was already 8:00 AM. I then glanced at the bed next to me, and realized Luke was already up.

‘He’s probably hungry or Eric’s already made something for him.’ I thought.  I could anyway hear the TV playing from living room

I slowly got up from the chair and walked toward the hall still groggy from last night. My legs suddenly buckled, and I hit the floor hard.

Eric’s severed head lay skewered on a pitch fork erected in the middle of the living room. I tried to get up, but my legs buckled again.

I crawled all the way to his room like a dog, and tried to open the door with my outstretched hand.

I had to grab onto the nearby wall to pull myself up and stand straight. That's when I saw my old friend's headless body lying on the bed. I puked my guts out right there.

 As I lay crouched on my knees, with my head still spinning, I suddenly remembered Luke. He was nowhere in sight.

I got up and searched every nook and cranny of the apartment. The bathrooms, the kitchen, the cupboards, under the bed, the attic, everywhere. He was nowhere to be found, and he is not the sort of kid to run off on his own.

I then went and started to check the other apartments in the building including the terrace and still found no trace of him. Finally I remembered the basement where I had parked the car and I immediately rushed to look for him there.

As I reached the entrance to the basement, I saw droplets of blood in the parking area and it led all the way to the trunk of my car.

My heart thudded in my chest as I walked slowly, my legs heavy like lead, refusing to move as I inched forward, terrified of what I would find.

When I finally reached the car, with trembling hands I opened the trunk and slowly peered in.

There, dead center, lay my burner phone, the same one I had purchased the previous night.

 As soon as I picked it up, it vibrated in my hand, revealing a new set of coordinates — coordinates pointing…. to my own home address.

Like getting the paperwork for an LLC, balancing the books and etc. My biggest problem is finding the connections and where to start. My lack of knowledge in the field I want to jump into. I lack much experience and a lot of other things. And I just want a little guidance on where I should start to search. 

This is the idea of mine that I've been thinking about quite a bit. The idea is a coffee-like energy drink like monster mocha or Starbucks triple shot. I want to produce a similar like product. Now I know the market's pretty saturated but I I want to give it a shot. My problem is I don't even know where to start with that. I know a lot of coffee energy drinks and cans are produced third party and really the only thing is distribution that is done by the actual label on the can. But of course the manufacturer doesn't put their label on the can. As again, it's a private label. 

So I guess my question is where would I go to find these manufacturers? And how do I figure out a formula that they can produce to make these coffee energy drinks?",0,1732805550.0,smallbusiness,1,0.5,False

Company D: $250 cheque. Nagulat ako first time ko and malaki na sobra sakin to. Ang generous lang haha. + Lunch out sa isang fine dining restau. Nice!

Company E: Isang box ng chocolates (yung mga tig $10 sa grocery) + party pero potluck, di sagot ng company

So far he's just been Demon of Mildly Annoying.

The concept of ""spite"" is a pretty specific thing, it's a very pointed and reactionary kind of maliciousness. When Lucanis asks your favorite kind of coffee, a *Spite* demon should spit in it. It should be something that revels in harming in deeply personal ways.

Like, this is something that should very purposefully make it harder to achieve your team's goals. When Davrin questions wheyher or not Lucanis is a good idea to keep on the team, I want that to be true! A Spite demon would be sabotaging things, on purpose, to be malicious. When Lucanis misses the attack on Ghilan'nain and the reason is ""he was distracted"", wouldn't it make more sense that it was the demon of Spite inside of him that deliberately threw the shot?

They kind of hand-wave his possession with him having some kind of supernatural level of self control, which feels so lazy, but even then I just haven't observed anything that would read to me as spiteful. Spite mostly just comments on how things smell and makes Lucanis sleepwalk. Demon of Not Too Inconvenient to the Plot.

It's a lot of missed opportunities. Especially with the romance. I would have expected romancing someone possessed by a Spite demon to be messy and complicated and a bit toxic, but I think anything less than idyllic is a bit too scary for Bioware at this point.",30,1732805426.0,dragonage,16,0.92,False

*sips coffee*☕️

So... I am looking at the charts and see that shib is in an oversold zone. 

STOCHASTIC RSI is tipping up off near bottom. The indicator lines have crossed upside which is usually a bullish signal. We should see saw up from here for a couple days. Don't know how high... but it should push up with healthy profit taking along the way.

MACD is rounding the bottom. It could be the deepest red candle yesterday and we start making lighter red candles as it works its way back up to rounding the top. Fingers crossed.

We been holding up quite well actually considering BTC fell from its 99k ... dipped and inched back up again.

All in all... things looking bullish for a few days.

This is not financial advice. Just my interpretation of what I see in the indicators based on their history and current positions.

Good luck!

P.s. I had some xrp... sold it at 1.49... If anyone is in xrp I think it's going to make a correction that is uncoupled from btc. I bought doge with my xrp now but may go back to xrp after it corrects.

Genre: Visual Novel, science fiction

Estimated year of release: just a guess but mid 2010s to june 2023 (when i watched a playthrough)

Graphics/art style: 2d, characters were drawn digitally in a realistic but stylized way, backgrounds were well done, and sometimes gorgeous. There were a few shots that really stuck out to me. The inside of the office building is a pale green, I believe, there are potted plants. Another frame, I think near the end of the game, has the main character on a bridge, looking out over a city, that looked purple and gold. There was also a scene in a dream with vibrant green grass and a glittering sky, and I believe a lake. There's a scene in a music club with vibrant lights, a campfire scene with four friends. 

Notable characters: Player character is a woman applying for a job at a virtual therapy company, who was previously a critical programmer to the project which developed the ai. There is also a blonde woman who formerly worked on the project but left and now makes music, and the current head of the company, a black haired man who is trying to entice the player to return to the team. There's also a data scientist you can get coffee with who admires your work greatly, and a semi washed up graying(I think?) man with a thing for your character and a dream of a breakthrough in dream stimulation technology. There are also a few notable clients, a man who at first seems really unstable, and angry, and looks like he hasn't been sleeping but later on in the game he comes back and expressed remorse for how he acted and how much you helped. There was also an old woman who didn't seem to need therapy so much as a friend to talk to.

Notable gameplay mechanics: When acting as a Proxy for the ai therapist, your character will be presented with the choice to follow the script given, or deviate from it, to try to give real, human help to the clients who show up. you can access the main characters phone for a number of functions including a mini game or two of I remember correctly, possibly sudoku. You could also use your phone to access the private information of some of your clients, to inform your decisions. 

Other details: Sorry for the occasional vaugeness and lots of uncertainty about specific things, I watched a playthrough of the game over a year ago. Did my best to be detailed and specific about as much as I could. Thanks for reading this!",0,1732803971.0,tipofmyjoystick,1,0.5,False

a colleague inviting me to walk out of the office for a few minutes. i accompany them to drive around; they accompany me to grab coffee.

it's there when *kuya* asks if i have any takeout, and i don't, so i go to a restaurant and order something so i can pretend i do.

it's when dad asks me to accompany him to the doctor because two chickens somehow make one brave chicken.

it's there when i was happy and content to be singing in the car in the middle of nighttime EDSA traffic, when i felt like i could be most myself in the company of people who barely know me.

it's there in random messages. *have dinner with me later.* or *when you have extra time, let's just go out to party and dance—no, we're not celebrating anything. we are destressing.*

it's there whenever i decide to play We're Not Really Strangers and get to know people in ways i never expected.

i felt love when somebody told me, *you are like a breath of fresh air. talking to you is an escape from the every day* when all those years i thought i was seen as an object. love was there when i felt human.

While it shares some architectural similarities with the 7th generation Kaby Lake, the introduction of quad-core CPUs in the U-series and other improvements make it distinctly part of the 8th generation.

As a child he would come take me out for the day from time to time and he was extremely emotionally manipulative. He is very passive aggressive and I avoid having any alone time with him because he just wants to do endless narc ranting at me. He has no sense of boundaries when he's around me and at family functions he will try and follow me around to get me alone and try and guilt trip or shame me about me keeping my distance from him. 

He has been texting me every few weeks inviting me for a coffee and I've ignored it. I am okay to see him around other family for very limited times but even then he will try and lean in close to me to whisper his narcisstic ramblings.. with a smile on his face. 


A few years ago I did have to send him a lengthy message explaining that I hate the way he treats everyone and I don't want to spend time with him and he perceived this as a starting point to us mending the relationship. So I fear if I remind him again I don't want to be alone with him he will just react by harrassing me further. Today I received this text: 

*Hey I have an advent calendar for you and I know everyone is busy so could we maybe grab a 'christmas' lunch one day next week? What days best and do you fancy trying somewhere not town <suggests two locations which require a long drive instead> maybe?*

I am sent into a panic every time he does this because I don't know what to say. I usually say I'm busy but I want to establish it's not happening. I cannot explain how much this mans presence makes my skin crawl. I have absolutely no love for him. I am just worried about his reaction. He is so highly emotional and aggressive. He also gives his sob story to my aunts about how he just doesn't understand why I am the way that I am to him.

Note, this is coming from daily brewing with a Ditting 804 for several years with the Lab Sweet and SSP 80mm HU mostly.

The grind is pretty coarse, but looks pretty uniform. No retention -  my Pietro lost none on first reading but then the scale showed a .1g loss but it was fluctuating.

I used 7.5 setting on a 23g dose. Based on the appearance of the finished grind, I would guess it was around 900 to 1000 microns. It was around my 804, which is calibrated at 50 microns off touch, at a 9 setting, maybe even coarser.

The coffee had a café tone to it, although both cafes I visit grind pretty coarse, one uses a Malhkonig Guatemala at its highest setting, for pour-over. The Pietro coffee was clean and thin, and not as fruity nor acidic-bright as the same coffee had been when ground with my 804 - likely from the coarseness as I was grinding around 700 microns for it on my 804. This coffee had a peppery aftertaste pretty strong on the Pietro. I had that taste occasionally with the same coffee in my 804 but much milder.

Basically, the 7.5 Pietro coffee was similar (thin, no body, but easy to sip - not a negative as it was very similar to cafe pour over) to coffees when I would occasionally do a 9 setting on my 804 which was rare as I mostly grind in the 6 to 7.5 range on it but would sometimes try 8+ when a coffee seemed over extracted or not pleasant at the normal range. I can fully understand Hoon's review of it when he said the Pietro compared to his EK43 was like a very good meat and potato dinner compared to a steak well seasoned.  That might sound negative, but the Pietro coffee is very good, and much like cafe's - grinding finer should add more flavor but I am not sure how hard it will be to grind finer as the every few revolution hiccups is what made grinding hard on it at a 7.5.",3,1732803503.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
