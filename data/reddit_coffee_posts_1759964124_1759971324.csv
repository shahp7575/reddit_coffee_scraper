1o1sfmc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o1sfmc,Online purchasing experience,"I just purchased my first JLC Reverso duo face small seconds for my wedding! I had a few options to purchase it before the price increase on the 15th ($800 increase). I have a local AD who was offering the same price as the JLC website, and they were throwing in a free strap as a gift to sweeten the deal. Knowing this, I took a chance and emailed JLC concierge team about my interest in purchasing the watch for my wedding, and a possibility for them to make it a special occasion compared to going through the local AD. 

Within a few hours, I had received a call from Caroline from the concierge team and helped me finalize the purchase. She was kind enough to offer some options as a gift for me to select from (2 different types of large watch cases, a single watch case, a coffee table book, & playing cards). They did have a limit on selecting just one gift option. I had also requested the team to swap out the standard blue leather strap with the black alligator strap, which they did complimentary. Caroline unfortunately mention that they would not be able to offer a free strap like the AD. But with that being said, I was surprised to see that they had thrown in the blue leather strap complimentary when I opened the box! She also added in a perfume sample which is surprisingly really good, and a cleaning cloth. Overall the entire process was smooth, especially since Caroline was available via text and was super quick on responding to any questions or request. I received my entire package in 3 different boxes and only took 2 days to arrive from a warehouse in Texas. The gifts are handled by a separate department, so it got ordered and shipped separately. 

Now comes the hard part of keeping the watch in the corner of my room for the next 6 months till the big day when I finally get to wear it for the first time! 

Side note: I later learned that all three straps are made/lined with calf skin leather, and I plan to replace them with vegan/cactus leather straps as I am a Hindu.

He is in his early 40s, well educated and has great parents who l got to talk to over the phone. 
As we've been spending time together in different places,  l noticed some strange behaviors like:

1. When we went to a coffee shop,  he started arranging chairs on the table next to ours because he didn't think they had been pushed in correctly. 

2. He started collecting cups on our table at the coffee shop to put them in the trash even though my other friend was still drinking coffee. 

3. At the supermarket,  he started arranging the ice-cream section because some ice-creams weren't properly placed in the correctly section of the refrigerator. 

4. Whenever we've met my friends,  he talks none stop and very fast and doesn't realize when people are tired of him talking. 

5. He's very rigid in what he likes, he likes amusement parks and basketball.  Yesterday we went to a cultural festival and 5 minutes later, he left and went to play basketball outside.  

6. He bites his nails a lot and farts when he feels like it. I asked him why he does that and he said because he feels comfortable around me. 

I wouldn't deliberately fart infront of anyone unless l really can't hold it. I try to avoid accumulating gas in my stomach and l did show him some methods of gas release techniques in the mornings.  

He's a smart guy and very loving and l enjoy spending time with him but l don't want to introduce him to my friends anymore because of his behavior. 
I asked him about some of the things he did and he said it's because he's OCD. I wish he had told me prior so l would have researched more about the condition. I'm sensitive towards people's struggles and don't want to cause him stress by telling him why l don't want to introduce him to my friends anymore.

1o1s7ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o1s7ie/i_30f_think_im_going_to_leave_my_husband_35m/,I (30F) think I‚Äôm going to leave my husband (35M),"Throwaway just in case.

Hi Reddit,

I (30F) have been married to my husband (35M) for about six years. After meeting in graduate school, we became good friends and started a relationship. He‚Äôs an immigrant from Asia, so we married within our first year together because his visa was due to expire. I agreed not only because he was so up front about it‚Äîlike, first date up front‚Äîbut because I truly believed in us and wanted to build a life together. Since he couldn‚Äôt work while he waited for his green card, I supported him both financially and emotionally, something he has always said he is grateful for.

Over time, though, our relationship has become‚Ä¶ well, exhausting. It‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs done a complete 180‚Äîhe‚Äôs still affectionate (with both me and our cat), says he loves me, and contributes to our household both physically (via housework) and financially with his job. We laugh and talk and have more inside jokes than I can count. But the rest of the time, I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells.

A few examples include the following:

* He‚Äôs very critical of me, often under the guise of ‚Äúhelping‚Äù or ‚Äúbeing honest.‚Äù He loves working out, so many of these comments are about my body or overall appearance. I have a bit of a tummy (I always have), and he‚Äôs outright said he considers it a ‚Äúproblem.‚Äù Never mind the fact that I work out myself and have a relatively healthy diet (especially since marrying him), it‚Äôs still not enough. He‚Äôs also commented a lot on my fashion choices. If I wear shorter shorts, he can see the hair on my thighs. If I wear longer ones, they‚Äôre ‚Äúunflattering‚Äù and make me ‚Äúlook like a mom.‚Äù During our last big discussion (the same one where he mentioned my tummy), he even said I don‚Äôt fit the image of the partner he imagined having. I‚Äôve repeatedly told him how much this bothers me, but he still does it.
* This also ties in to my diet and eating habits. I have a bit of a sweet tooth, and he appears to be very judgmental about that. He makes a comment whenever I get dessert without him, and even once told me he didn‚Äôt want me buying fruit popsicles this past summer‚Äînot because he didn‚Äôt like them or they were expensive, but because *he didn‚Äôt want me eating them.* I‚Äôve struggled with body image issues my entire life, some of which bled over to my eating habits, and this is only making them worse.
* He doesn‚Äôt like me taking necessary medication. I take meds for anxiety and depression, and recently started something for an autoimmune disease I have‚Äîand he still thinks it‚Äôs too much. He often comments on my habits or choices as if he knows what‚Äôs best for me, and has said before that because of my past (my parents are divorced, and my mother was very overbearing), he doesn‚Äôt think I can take care of myself ‚Äî but the way he says it feels more controlling than caring.
* He‚Äôs also gotten moody and frustrated with me over small things‚Äîlike closing a door too loudly, spilling coffee on the counter, or getting directions wrong while we were on vacation. Because of this, almost every trip we‚Äôve ever taken together has been dampened in some way, even if just for a short time. He also got angry with me while we were moving a piece of heavy furniture. I kept having visible difficulties, but instead of expressing empathy or kindness, he got angry. When he acts like this, he‚Äôs previously asked me to give him space and not take it personally‚Äîbut I find that impossible when his anger shifts the entire atmosphere of the house.

After these episodes, he always apologizes and promises to do better‚Äîand for a while, he does. But after a while, it happens again, and I‚Äôm left questioning our entire relationship. We‚Äôve both been in therapy (individual and couples), and I can see that he‚Äôs trying on some level. But even then, it can‚Äôt erase the damage, and I feel like I‚Äôm living in constant anticipation of the next time I‚Äôll disappoint him.

At this point, I feel small, drained, and like nothing I do is ever good enough. I still love my husband, and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs an evil person, but I‚Äôm starting to believe that love isn‚Äôt enough anymore. I‚Äôve even looked into renting a room somewhere just to get some space and think clearly. Part of me feels guilty for that, but another part of me thinks it‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôll ever breathe again.

**TL;DR:** Married my husband earlier than usual so he could stay in the country and supported him while he got his green card. Years later, he‚Äôs become overly critical, controlling, and moody. He says he loves me and wants the best for me, but I constantly feel small and not good enough. I think it's time for me to leave.",1,1759970339.0,relationships,5,0.56,False

Hi all. I have CPTSD, Sleep apnea, and ADHD. I also strongly suspect being on the ASD spectrum.

I just got out of a 10 year long marriage and one of the main things we fought about was food and money. I grew up in poverty and developed a love of food and cooking as a hobby and coping skill. I would take what little we had and turn it into a lot or something tasty. I cooked for my siblings. And I snacked for stimulation. I also experienced a lot of food insecurity as a child; one particularly bad summer, my mother was so broke she could not feed any of us (4 kids) for four straight days. It was terrible.

I dont consider my eating to be problematic; I don't binge (I never eat a large amount of food in one sitting; in fact, I usually eat less than what other people at the table do). I don't have any restricting behaviors and I'm not excessively picky. However, my ex-husband and now my current partner of two years have both had serious concerns about my eating habits and my weight. Both have stated that they feel I indulge too much (especially coffee, sweets, and other kinds of junk/fast food) and that it's not so much how \*much\* i'm eating, but that what I eat is often very calorically dense. At home, I eat very healthy, with veggies/homecooked meals.

I would say that I probably eat fast food 1-2x a week; maybe have dinner out somewhere 1-2x per week; have maybe one bag of chips throughout the week (not even every week); a coffee most/every day (sometimes at home, sometimes bought); and dessert honestly probably every day.

While my ex-husband was incredibly critical of my food habits and said they were expensive and that he was worried about my health, my current partner has taken a much kinder and more honest approach and has told me that it hurts him to see me eat so much sugar and that he feels the way I act with sugar is like an addiction. I thought about this a lot and I think it has a lot to do with my ADHD. I know that seeking stimulation is a common thing with ADHD. I've since tried to significantly if not completely cut out sugar until I feel like I'm in control of my diet, not the other way around. It's been INCREDIBLY hard. The cravings are strong. I just wanted to share this and ask for others experiences if this is something you've gone through. As mentioned, what I'm experiencing doesn't really seem to be an eating disorder in either direction. It feels more like an ADHD, impulsivity and self-soothing thing. I'm trying to figure it out, but would appreciate hearing other people's thoughts and journeys.",1,1759970186.0,EmotionalEating,0,1.0,False

The difference to me is in all these instances they are at me with this strange look like they are brewing something up in their mind.

There are moments where it‚Äôs small things like at different coffee shops they will get your order wrong and stare at you in a strange way like they are planning something. Then proceed to stare at you as you. If you go up to fix your item they will look at you like they got caught and have this tail between their legs look.


Then are bigger situations like I went to the pharmacy and this woman charged me $50 for an item that‚Äôs usually $15. I go to fix it with another person and when I ask why it was charged like that they can‚Äôt even answer because it‚Äôs so strange and makes no sense. There was another time I got completely the wrong medication at a pharmacy and when I went back to get the right one the person who messed it up was in the back staring at me the whole time like they knew they got caught. There was another time I bought a dress and the store person scanned it multiple times so that my bill was more expensive. I noticed it wasn‚Äôt right so I went back in to fix it and the person who did it wrong was freaking out walking around me pacing then grabbing every employee around her to say she didn‚Äôt know what happened like she didn‚Äôt do that on purpose then literally ran away saying she had to go take her lunch break. 

There are moments also where I‚Äôll go to the doctors and they‚Äôll have other people in the room doing stuff for me or have the door wide open just no privacy and just be overall disrespectful.

1o1rxns,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o1rxns/they_called_that_place_the_colony_and_i_was_the/,"They called that place ""The Colony."" And I was the entertainment.","I don't know where to start. My name is Gabriel, or at least it was. If anyone from my past is reading this, they probably think I'm dead. Maybe I am. After what I lived through, the line between being alive and being a monster is very thin.

It all started with a scream in the dark. A high-pitched scream that cut through the night and then... silence. I woke up with a taste of iron in my mouth, like I'd bitten my tongue, but worse. It was dark, damp. The sound of dripping water was my only company, besides the chains on my wrists. The cell was tiny, the size of a shipping container. The kind of place where you can scream until your lungs give out, and no one will hear you.

But¬†*someone*¬†was watching me. I could feel it.

In the first ""days"" (if you could even call them that), I realized I wasn't alone. There were others. Murmurs in the corridors, insane laughter that sounded like it was from a horror movie, and the smell... my God, the smell of raw and rotten meat. Someone was eating something they shouldn't.

I met a guy, Andr√©. He whispered through a crack in the wall. He said we were lab rats. ""They take people no one will look for,"" he said. ""The homeless, illegal immigrants, addicts... They test how long it takes for us to turn into animals."" He laughed, a laugh with no joy, just pure desperation. Hours later, I heard his teeth tearing into something they threw into his cell. He cried while he ate.

I learned quickly that trust was a death sentence. There was a traitor among us. Marina tried to organize an escape. I almost joined her, but something held me back. Three days later, she came back. But it wasn't Marina anymore. Her eyes were empty, like a doll's. She walked like the guards. Some of us had already become¬†*theirs*.

When they took me to the Room, I thought it was the end. Two guards with gas masks, the old-fashioned kind that make a noise when they breathe. They strapped me to a chair. There were scalpels, saws... but they didn't touch me. Instead, they turned on a projector.

And then I saw my mother. In our kitchen, drinking coffee. So normal... until she turned her head. Her eyes were black holes, leaking something that wasn't tears. Her mouth opened in an impossible way and she screamed. A voice from a loudspeaker said, ""You abandoned her. You knew she was sick. You ran away.""

It was a lie. It had to be. But after hours of that, with the chains forcing me to watch everyone I ever loved being tortured and blaming me... part of me started to believe it.

Time lost all meaning. I wasted away to bone. My hair fell out. I started talking to myself. One night, I woke up with a piece of warm meat in my hand. I don't know where it came from. I don't know what it was. I ate it. And I cried while I ate. I wished for more.

That's when the man in the next cell made me an offer. ""I can get you out of here,"" he said. In exchange for information. In exchange for betraying the others. I felt disgusted. But also... tempted.

Until I discovered the truth. A tiny camera, hidden in the mold. There were several. They weren't just watching us. They were¬†*filming*¬†us. This was entertainment. A snuff show for rich people. I wasn't a prisoner. I was an actor.

The chance to escape came when a guard left the door open for three seconds. I grabbed his head and smashed it against the wall. I felt pleasure. That scared me, but I was beyond fear.

I led a revolt. Dozens of us, skeletal and bloodied, massacred the guards. It was brutal. Inhuman. Until we reached the final door.

It was a huge room, with a giant mirror covering the wall.

And we saw.

Monsters. Mutilated faces, destroyed bodies, humanity erased. Someone started screaming. Marina (or what was left of her) cut her own throat. Others followed. A mass suicide. Seeing themselves was the final torture.

I stood still, looking at my reflection. Was that still me in there?

That's when the guards came back. And they took off their masks.

It was Andr√©. Marina. The man with the offer. All of them. Prisoners who had become executioners to survive.

""Sorry,"" Andr√© whispered, as he handcuffed me again. ""It's you or me.""

I didn't fight back. I just laughed.

And then the lights came on. Behind the ""mirror""‚Äîwhich was just one-way glass‚Äîwas the audience. Men in suits, women in dresses, champagne... applauding. As if it were a play.

When the scalpel finally cut, I thanked them. Because it was over.

Or maybe it wasn't.

1. **Derek Chauvin/George Floyd incident in 2020**, ever since the Derek Chauvin/George Floyd Incident of 2020, the number of applicants for law enforcement related positions has been on a decline. Higher accountability, tighter restrictions on what is allowed and isn't allowed, fear of being fired, sued and/or being arrested, body worn cameras, and the anti-police rhetoric from the public, have all played a part in the declining numbers.

2. **COVID-19-** During the pandemic, everyone became lazy, because most jobs offered telework and everyone got use to working from home. Let's face it, who wouldn't want to work from home? Would you rather have to hit your alarm clock in the morning, fight traffic getting to work, deal with your crappy coworkers and pretend to be interested in what they did over the weekend and have to do deal with the snitch that sits next to your cubicle, oh and fight traffic on the way home. And then you get to do it all over again for the next four days out of the week. Or behind door #2, you get to roll out of bed in your pj's, take your time drinking your coffee and eating your bagel with smoked salmon cream cheese on top and then hop on your computer and do whatever it is that needs to be done. And you get to run some errands during the day, which you could only do on the weekends, if you had to go into work. It's your choice.

3. **SOCIAL MEDIA MILLIONAIRES-** Social Media has created more millionaires and sub-millionaires in our lifetime than in any other lifetime. Unfortunately, this is a small percentage of people, but has created delusions of grandeur in some people. Hell, I don't blame them. Why work a real job, when you can make stupid TikTok videos and make a 100 grand a year. 

4. **GENERATION Z-** I was always taught by my parents to get a job that offered a pension. Obviously those jobs are few and far between now, because it's just too expensive for towns, cities, counties or states to uphold in the long run. I was also always taught to stay in the particular job for 25 or more years. Nowadays the new generation are easily bored and in my opinion its due to social media and quick dopamine hits with scrolling. With that being said, this new generation doesn't stay in jobs for very long. They jump from job to do job to job. I see it in the Police Department. the younger generation gets bored and leave after a couple of years. ",1,1759969085.0,DONT_BE_A_COP,0,1.0,False

(Some of us coffee peons like to  throw around scientific jargon and tech-no babble to sound uber smart. What I meanI is that it is slippery as vaseline on a skateboard :-)

I tried brewing direct to a Fellow travel mug and it was minor disaster. The brewer slipped off and I got 200¬∞+ water on my  chest and the counter. I ran cold water over the burns for 15 minutes or so, and had no discomfort the next day.

Can't blame it entirely on the brewer. I was using the Switch with the same travel mug a couple of months ago, and had a worse experience.

 I knocked the 03 brewer off with the kettle spout and got 1st and 2nd degree burns over most of my  left chest. The burns took several weeks to heal and they were definitely uncomfortable

I'm using a Mason jar as a carafe for the moment,  so would appreciate recommendations for a server that will work securely with the little single cup SWD brewer - preferably one I can order from Amazon.

As usual, thanks for the help.

1o1rozf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1o1rozf/remove_charred_flavor_from_dark_roast/,remove charred flavor from dark roast?,"Is there any trick to minimizing the charred flavors that come out of burnt dark roasted beans?  Assuming there are too many to just pick out the bad ones.  Any filtration tactics that help, like with the bed?  Any additions, like baking soda or salt?  I'm still dialing grinds, going towards coarser at the moment.

Yes, the logical answer would be to avoid buying any dark roast that has lots of charred beans to begin with.  However I'm still going through all the grocery store coffees available in my area, to determine basic competence.  If I only had a charred bean here and there, I know I could pick them out.  But there are so many, I figure it's hopeless.  Either I come up with an extraction process that minimizes the charred flavor, or I throw the coffee away.

To name and shame, the current offender is a bag of Peet's Major Dickason's Blend, purchased at Walmart.  Best by date of April 2, 2026.  According to their website, their roasting date is 270 days prior, so early September 2025.  A little over a month old, if they're to be believed.  In addition to being charred, the beans are fairly boring and unaromatic.  I will never buy this again, but I'm working with it for now.

The previous offender was Charleston Coffee Roasters, a regional outfit that has given me 3 bad bags of coffee, including one dark roast with the burned marks.  In fairness, the Peet's is much worse, but that one was still bad.  My notes say that even doing cold brew, I got a metallic aftertaste from the charred parts.  I was brewing with glass then, with a plastic cap, so no metal source in my equipment.  Some have questioned whether my water is the issue, but I haven't figured that out.  Just drinking the water does not taste metallic at all.

Why am I bothering with dark roasts at all?  I have stomach issues with coffee acid, most likely with chlorogenic acid.  Dark roast is a strategy for reducing acid, as is cold brew.  It sacrifices flavor, but I was at the point of perhaps having to give up coffee entirely.  So I'm working on how to get something worthwhile out of dark roasts, and how to avoid the flavors from the charred beans that keep popping up.

The grocery store part of it is food stamp driven.  If I completely run out of options, then I'll finally start spending cash for my coffee.  Until then, I work with what I can get, and I try to improve my technique.

I had some Kicking Horse Kick Ass dark roasted beans, because they were on sale at the time.  They were not burnt.  However, they were boring.  I doubt they were exceptionally fresh, as that's often why things go on sale.  I know that some of their other bags on the shelf were very much expired, aside from the one I got.  They're a Canadian outfit and I'm in the USA, so tariff problems are imminent for them.  In fact they started a movement in Canada to rename the Americano to the Canadiano.  I admire their pluck, I wish they could rename the POTUS while they're at it!  But I've tried 'em 3 times and got 1 good bag, 1 bad bag, and 1 boring bag.  I think my local grocery store supply chain kinda sucks.

**Huckleberry Roasters (Sunnyside neighborhood):**  Next, I headed here for a mocha and some pastries. Vintage with exposed brick and neon accents, and the drinks are excellent. Perfect spot to relax for a bit.

**Corvus Coffee Roasters (Downtown):** I ended my crawl here, a modern caf√© with really smooth lattes and a nice selection of seasonal drinks. The interior is stylish but still comfortable, and they roast their beans locally, which I loved coffee purists are going to love it too.

I tried all of this in a single day, and even though I was basically about to walk on the walls from all the caffeine, I was super happy haha. I love coffee and going to caf√©s even more.

If you‚Äôre in Denver and want to enjoy some great coffee while exploring the city, I definitely recommend these spots. Have you been to any of these, or do you have other favorite coffee spots in Denver? I‚Äôd love to hear your suggestions!",1,1759968227.0,BeautifulTravelPlaces,0,1.0,False

1o1rg4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1o1rg4x/a_morning_of_writing_nothing/,A Morning of Writing Nothing,"I stare at the ceiling in my bedroom, and wonder what day it is.

**8am**:

I wake up, my body still reminded of the time when I'd have a routine or a schedule. I stare at my ceiling, conflicted, trying to decide if I'm going to sleep in or let the retired corporate clock win again. I feel the urge to get up due to reasons, but I try to fight it and convince myself that it's not urgent. I glance over at my phone; 1 minute has passed, and I'm still having a debate about whether I should or shouldn't get up today.  
  
I think to myself, maybe I can prolong getting out of bed as my final act of rebellion by going on my phone, either by opening a social media app like Instagram or by playing a game like Pok√©mon Masters EX. I convince myself that as long as I don't get out of bed, I've won, especially this early. This method works in the sense that I end up not getting out of bed for another hour or so due to doom-scrolling or silly gaming, as my eyes try to adjust to the new day. 

**9am**:

My doom-scrolling or gaming session has been interrupted by an alarm clock. Not my alarm clock, but my lovely partner's alarm clock. He hits snooze, tosses and turns, then falls back asleep within second. He's a champion at this sleeping sport, really. I go back to my phone, lurking on Reddit now, to see if there is a new thread about Love Is Blind Season 9 (which... YIKES) or about how the games I play are more pay-to-win rather than free-to-play. I ignore that and continue on into the endless abyss of numbing threads.  
  
As I settle into my new comfort, I'm jolted back into existence due to my partner's alarm going off again. He hits snooze and goes back to sleep effortlessly. This dance will continue until about 10:30 a.m. when he officially wakes up to start his day. Fortunately for me, I decide to get out of bed after the second alarm and ""start"" my day. Think of the normal stuff in the morning; I do them. Sometimes my beard will be a mess or my bald head will be looking like a chia pet, so I'll add shaving in the shower to the itinerary for the day. Moisturize after because looking pretty at 30 comes with some effort. Thanks, Elemis, for having my back.

**10am**:

I continue to hear the alarm clock periodically from the bedroom, even though the door is closed. I laugh to myself on the couch as I look at my tiny screen for an answer to what to do today. Will I walk? Will I write? Will I binge Game of Thrones like that one year in college? Who knows what the day will bring for me, as I open another app and scroll into oblivion. It's not like there's ever really anything interesting on there, but it's a nice dopamine kick. Soon my stomach starts to do its thing and ask for food, so my mind pulls up a few tabs of what I could eat.  
  
A great distraction from doing anything else. Yes, I like this plan. What should I eat? Let's see, there's Starbucks. I have stars left over from the last time, so maybe I should get a sandwich, or a cold brew with the seasonal cold foam on top, or both. How exciting! Maybe I should be a good partner and surprise the boo with a drink too. Why not?! I pull up the app and place my order. 5 to 7 minutes until it's ready for pickup. Oh, what fun. I get dressed and invite the sleepy boyfriend on the walk, to which he politely declines as he hits snooze again. I grab my keys, wallet, phone (all important!), and walk out the door. As I wait for the elevator, I get a push notification saying that my order is ready. How thoughtful of them to let me know. What a kind capitalist.

I walk outside and am immediately charmed by how nice the day is. The city is awake at 10 a.m., and it's nice to be out and about before I crawl back into my apartment like the coffee goblin I am, but in this moment, I like it. I get to Starbucks, the usuals are there, I grab my stuff and go. Making my way back to the apartment, I start to get this plausible sensation that this trip to Starbucks and picking up my coffee order was a tiring task, and that if I choose to do nothing the rest of the day, I at least did something.

**11am**:

The cold brew brings me the caffeine-induced paranoia needed to pull me into my loosely scheduled professional career spiral. Have no fear, I tell myself, for there are plenty of hours left in the day to accomplish something, and even still, I was able to go outside and get coffee, right? I laugh to myself, thinking that scheduling my own coffee run makes me an assistant to myself. But after the assistant (me) does the job, when do I actually do the thing? When do I actually start to write or even ideate? Sigh... I turn on the TV.  
  
Technology has grown so much since I was little; what a great way to pass the time and appreciate the growth of society. Let's look at TV, for instance. I was almost conditioned to love cable networks and commercial jingles. Luckily, streaming platforms came out and helped me develop a TV disorder. Watching anything with more than a 30-second commercial irritates me now, and at the same time, I can play a whole series without interruptions and forget literally all of it in a second. And when interest in that particular show kicks off the dust in my brain, it's canceled by some mega-corp spewing things like ""profits"" or whatever. I just want Sense8 back, okay? Geez.  
  
I sit here and think about how addicted I am to binge-watching content that I really do classify this as a disorder. Right on schedule, going from panic spiral to psychologist, woo - I'm busy today! Imagine if we only felt loved for longer than a 30-second commercial, where might we be? Okay, philosophical therapist... chill... it's too early. My subconscious takes control, back to streaming. I hear there's a super cringey season of a problematic dating show; let's watch it, then fight with our significant other! My assistant (me) comes in and squeezes in a small argument about nothing important around dinner time, marking the other party as optional.  
  
The reality dating show plays in the background, and I immediately pull out my phone. I told you I'm busy. I look to see if my email has an update from my job search (no) or if there is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that reads ""We want you to be the next writer on our hit show!"" - which would be hilarious and iconic even though I haven't written anything. It'll be like fate, like the universe knew and chose me! I look at my inbox and see a 50% promotional email, the same one that was sent at 6 a.m., now arriving again. Silly marketers, I'm waiting for my big break here, move along.

**12pm**:

My boyfriend comes out of his work meeting to ask if we should heat up leftovers from the night before for lunch or order something. I sit there with severe brain-fog like I've been hit with the hardest question known to man, and say ""up to you!"", we eat the leftovers. Damn, I really wanted a Thai food, why didn't he know that? Maybe I can use this in the small argument later, how efficient of me. So proactive of me for coming up with things to fight about, ahead of schedule I might add.   
  
He goes back to work and I sit on the couch finishing up lunch, feeling better from the morning spirals. The thought of writing enters my mind again, and I actually entertain it. I start to think about what I should write today, but then, like clockwork, immediately feel pigeonholed with the thought of only writing one thing, and force myself to think about all the other things I could write today too! I could write a page or 10 for a book idea that I've had, and even work through the backstories of characters and places for that world, and even another blog post. The thoughts around all of this are all so exciting, and I start to feel like I can conquer the world!   
  
I open my laptop, and with this sudden rush of adrenaline, open up my drafts and start editing any work that I've done previously. Rewriting endlessly until a sentence or paragraph makes sense. I take a mental break and check my phone for any updates. A reply from unemployment to submit my benefits for the week, whoops, let me do that real quick! I'll get back to writing after, I tell myself. It starts to feel like things are getting better as I enter the afternoon.   
  
I get a push notification from the apple news app with a bold & gloomy headline. Another one, and another one, and another one. I stop writing. I stop what I'm doing. I resume streaming, binging as much content as I can to drown out the noise. How fun today has been!

I can't get too off schedule here though, I have an argument later!",1,1759968170.0,writers,3,0.67,False
1o1rg1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o1rg1u/i_think_i_might_be_going_insane_part_one/,I Think I Might Be Going Insane. [part one],"¬†I don't know what to think. A month or so ago I started talking to this girl. Things were going relatively well for a while, that‚Äôs a bit of an understatement. We hit it off from the get go, everything was moving quickly; before it happened. About four weeks after we started talking she told me she was going on a trip for a bit and asked me for a favor, she wanted me to house sit. Jane, well that‚Äôs at least what I called her, her full name was Janie; admitted that she never thought our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù would make it this far, she had planned to be out of communication with me by the time her trip date was here. We found each other on a dating app and met one night for dinner. It was blatantly obvious that the both of us were only interested in a hookup, and that‚Äôs how it started.¬†



After some drunken encouragement from Jane, I spontaneously decided to spend the night at her place. I awoke to a face, her face, hovering inches above mine; a soft but focused look etched into her expression. I jumped a bit, confused by my surroundings before remembering the events of the previous night. I opened my mouth to speak but before I could get a word in I felt the weight at the end of the bed shift. The blankets and top sheet pulling taut against my feet. Jane didn‚Äôt react for a moment, her gaze still locked onto mine. My attention, however, moved to the disturbance. I was met with the sight of a frail looking long haired cat. Its gray fur was slicked into plumes around its neck; they looked like little garlic cloves. I didn‚Äôt know she had a cat. I have no memory of seeing one last night, though, I didn't have many memories of last night anyway. She turned and looked over her shoulder before perking up and leaning back.¬†



‚ÄúCaspurr!‚Äù¬†

She cooed out, scooping the cat into her arms and holding it against her chest. I was never a big cat person, not a big pet person in general. I didn‚Äôt have any growing up so I never really got the hype. She looked back at me and smiled, opening her mouth to speak.¬†

""Someone's hungry.‚Äù

She said, standing up as Caspurr leapt out of her arms and trotted out the door, down the hall to the kitchen.



¬†I stood and followed, grabbing my sweatpants off the floor and stepping into them. As I made my way into the kitchen a bright warm light flooded my vision, making me wince. As my eyes adjusted to the light I could see her, standing over the stove in a t-shirt and sleep shorts. She was preparing a pan for something. I made my way to her, passing Caspurr as he lapped up the mushy pile of wet food in his ceramic dish. The kitchen was large and brightly lit, the walls lined with white stone counter tops. I could tell from our first date that she was more well off than I was. Though this was the first night I spent over at her house the surroundings felt comfortable and welcoming, I didn‚Äôt feel out of place. Maybe my belongings being strewn about the rooms helped fuel that feeling. I heard the sound of oil crackling and my attention shifted to Jane as she lifted an egg out of a carton adjacent to her and tapped it on the counter top before cracking it into the pan. She did this two more times before I approached her from behind and leaned my head down, holding it above the crook of her neck.¬†

‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre not picky, it‚Äôs going to avocado toast today for breakfast.‚Äù¬†

She said.¬†

‚ÄúFine by me.‚Äù¬†

I replied quietly, raising a hand and cautiously placing it on her waist. She reciprocated the gesture, leaning into my touch and giggling softly. I stepped back and gave her space as the edge of the eggs began to crisp up. I knew she would need to flip them soon and didn‚Äôt want to crowd her. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I had a home cooked meal.



¬†I made my way to the sink and began to wash the glasses we had used last night, some of them still had remnants of mixed drink left in the bottom. There were four glasses, two of them had a deep purplish red lipstick stain on the rim. The ones that didn‚Äôt must have been mine. I lifted one of the cups without the lipstick stains to rinse it and noticed a black grainy residue at the bottom of the glass. Back then i didn‚Äôt think much of it, now i wished i would have just given it a second thought. I turned the tap on and filled the glass up with water, diluting the remaining contents and dumping it out. It took only about five minutes to hand wash the few glasses. By that time Jane was already setting plates down at the kitchen island and taking a seat on one of the bar stools. I followed her actions and sat across from her, reaching out to the plates in the middle of the counter top. Before I could grab one Jane swiftly and casually snatched the plate away, pulling it over to her and smiling. Now there was only one plate left, I slid it towards me and looked down at it. The food was nearly identical to what was on her plate. I figured maybe she just added a different seasoning to hers and didn‚Äôt want me to have that one. I must have had a look or something on my face because she quickly broke the silence.¬†



‚ÄúI have celiac disease.‚Äù

She said, pointing down to the toast.

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

I replied, feeling relieved for some reason.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep that in mind when it‚Äôs my turn to cook.‚Äù

I laughed and she followed, leaning over the counter and bracing herself against it. The laughter faded and was replaced by the sound of fork scratching against ceramic dishes. We ate mostly in silence, momentarily breaking out into small talk every now and then. When she was nearly done with her food she spoke.¬†

‚ÄúCan I ask you a favor?‚Äù

She asked.   
‚ÄúYeah, go for it.‚Äù

I replied through a mouthful of food.

‚ÄúWell, I'm leaving town for a few days tomorrow and was wondering if you would be interested in taking care of things around my house for a bit while I'm away.‚Äù

She mentioned previously how she was taking a trip out of the state for a week while she visited family across the country.¬†

I paused and thought for a moment. I was only scheduled to work three consecutive days this week, not to mention her house was only a 20 or so minute drive away from mine.¬†

‚ÄúI just need someone to water my plants and feed Caspurr while I'm gone.‚Äù

She added, putting her fork down and looking up at me. I felt a bit of pressure, but I did like her a lot. More than I planned to.   
‚ÄúYeah, sure. I can do that‚Äù

I replied. Her eyes lit up and she smiled at me.

‚ÄúThank you! I owe you one, seriously.‚Äù

Her voice took on a relieved tone.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it.‚Äù¬†

I smiled before finishing my food and stacking my dishes. I went to stand up and grab hers as well, as she had also finished eating. Before I could she nearly jumped out of her seat, her chair scraping against the tile floor and echoing throughout the large kitchen. She hurried over to me carrying her plate and snatched up the dishes I had sitting on the counter.

‚ÄúSit.‚Äù¬†

She said, something about her expression and tone made it feel like more of a demand than like she was doing me a favor.

‚ÄúAllow me.‚Äù

Her tone completely changed, taking on something more playful. I watched as she took our plates over to the sink and began washing them. I was going to say something to her but before I could my vision blurred for a second and I felt the sensation of a splitting headache. I winced and pressed my hand against my face, trying to block out the light. I think she looked back at me because the sound of her movement stopped. I couldn‚Äôt see her but the only sound I could hear now was running water. The sound of footsteps replaced the silence and I could hear them getting closer to me.¬†

‚ÄúWhats wrong?‚Äù

She said quietly, sounding concerned. She leaned over me, blocking out some of the light from the window and gently placing her hand to the side of my face.¬†

‚ÄúMy head, it‚Äôs pounding‚Äù

I groaned out, leaning into her. She carefully wrapped her arms around me and whispered.

‚ÄúVodka Cranberry, fun til it isn't huh?. Let me get you some water and tylenol. Why don‚Äôt you go lay down?‚Äù



I nodded and leaned away from her before steadying myself enough to stand. Once I'm successfully upright Jane walked off and opened a cabinet and began rummaging around inside. I turned away and walked past the staircase into the living room. My shoes and jacket are strewn around the floor making more obstacles to navigate around. Once I made my way to the couch I carefully laid down. I could feel my heart thumping in my head, this was the most serious migraine I have had in a while. I wasn‚Äôt thinking about it long before Jane hurried into the living room, crouching down and setting two pills in my hand. She assisted me with sitting up and I popped them into my mouth, taking the glass of water from her and chugging nearly the whole thing. I laid back down and felt a wave of nausea, in an attempt to relieve it I rolled over on my left side. It subsided enough for me to feel somewhat comfortable. So comfortable that at some point I must have fallen asleep. By the time I had woken up the sun had begun to set.¬† My headache had faded but was definitely still there, just less aggressively. I groaned and flopped onto my back, preparing myself to stand. I heard Jane walking down the stairs and she nearly walked past me before realizing that I was awake. She stopped and came over.¬†

‚ÄúDaniel?‚Äù

Her voice was very hushed when she spoke. I opened my eyes carefully, not wanting to anger the headache. I was met with her sympathetic expression. It contrasted the now cold living room. Without the sunlight things got pretty cold at night, it was mid October after all.

‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù

She asked.



‚ÄúAlright, it‚Äôs cold though.‚Äù

My voice was stiff and breaky, not to mention how dry my mouth was. I licked my lips but this only made me realize how thirsty I was.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get a fire going, doesn‚Äôt that sound nice?‚Äù

She leaned down and whispered.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs spend some quality time together before I go.‚Äù

I smiled and let out a quiet chuckle before sitting up.

‚ÄúSounds lovely.‚Äù



I felt like shit but her sweet talking had made things just a little better. She stood up and turned away to the fireplace, grabbing a starter log and tossing it in. As I wobbled to my feet and walked out I could hear the flick of a lighter. I made my way to the kitchen and opened the same cabinet I saw her grab the other cups from. I grabbed one out and brought it to the sink, filling it up and lifting my head to look out the window. It was nearly dark outside now, I thought how could I have been asleep for that long? I was feeling completely fine before that. I stood in the kitchen finishing my water. From the living room I could hear the fire crackling. It motivated me to put the glass down and go enjoy the warmth. Caspurr must have realized there was a fire going because he stepped away from his food bowl and trotted out the kitchen. I followed and sure enough, we ended up in the living room together. There, I saw Jane, sitting down on the carpet in front of the fireplace across from the couch with Caspurr curled up in her lap. She looked perfect. Her face was warmly lit by the fire and her hair was draped across her neck and shoulders, partially skewing the view of her face. She looked up at me and spoke in a hushed tone.¬†

‚ÄúCome, sit.‚Äù

She patted the ground next to her and I walked over before sitting down and wrapping my arm around her. The house was quiet aside from the sound of Caspurr purring and the fire crackling.¬†

‚ÄúThis is nice.‚Äù

I said softly. After a couple minutes of enjoying the fire she leaned over and rested her head on my shoulder, craning her neck up and bringing her face to my ear.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go upstairs.‚Äù

She said.¬†



One thing led to another and the next thing I remember was waking up in the middle of the night in her bed, I could feel her laying next to me, against me. That‚Äôs not all though. I was laying on my side with my back facing her and I could also feel pressure on the side of my neck. It was her hand, it felt kind of like she was trying to check my pulse. As I was mustering up the courage to say something I felt her hand pull away as she laid back down. I tried to brush it off and closed my eyes, not long after I ended up falling asleep again.¬†

When I woke up in the morning I could hear Jane shuffling around in the room. I sat up and stretched, looking towards the end of the bed. I saw her, kneeling on the ground sorting through piles of clothes. Next to her was an opened suitcase, the only thing in it was a pair of shoes and a zip up bag. I could hear her muttering to herself intermittently. Once she realized I was awake she smiled brightly.¬†



‚ÄúGood morning!‚Äù¬†

She said excitedly before holding up two dresses.

‚ÄúWhich one.‚Äù

I paused and thought for a moment before pointing to the dress on my right. A long blue and black flowy one. She turned the dress over and gave it another look before folding it and placing it in her suitcase. I yawned and stood up.

‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù

I asked curiously.¬†

‚ÄúAlmost eleven, why?‚Äù

She replied.

‚ÄúOh shit! Shit‚Ä¶‚Äù

I quickly threw on my clothes and began to grab up all of my belongings.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

She asked, a bit nervously.

‚ÄúI have work at eleven thirty!‚Äù

I sputtered out, stepping into my shoes and hurrying out the door.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I heard her shout from behind me.¬†

Reluctantly I paused and turned to her.¬†

‚ÄúIm leaving at five to catch my flight. I‚Äôll leave a key for you under the mat. Caspurr‚Äôs food is in the cabinet under the sink and there's a watering can on the patio.‚Äù

She listed off a bit of information and I nodded with each statement, making an effort to remember what she had said. I turned my back to her and stepped forward, she grabbed my arm. I was more annoyed this time but that quickly dissipated as she grabbed my face, turned it towards her, and kissed me. It was genuine and passionate. She pulled away and spoke softly.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you soon.‚Äù



I nodded and echoed her statement before smiling and making my way through the hall and down the stairs. I grabbed my coat off the hook and opened the front door, stepping out and walking over to my car. I got in and tossed my phone on the dash. As I was pulling out of the driveway I could hear it vibrate and the screen lit up. In the reflection of the windshield I could see the name displayed on my phone. ‚ÄúNatalie‚Äù my girlfriend. But I couldn‚Äôt see what the text said. I know, I'm a piece of shit and a liar, anything you have to say about me is warranted. I have no excuse or justification, people fuck up. Trust me, it‚Äôs now my biggest regret.¬†



Once I arrived at work I pulled out my phone and responded to her ‚Äúwhere have you been, I miss you.‚Äù text. I replied with something along the lines of, ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôve just been busy lately.‚Äù¬†



My shift was nearly over now, it was now almost six. Things were pretty slow so I decided to check my phone, not like anyone was around to tell me not to. I had gotten a text that I missed the notification for, It was Jane. The text read, ‚ÄúJust boarded the plane, send me lots of Caspurr pictures!!! :)‚Äù I chuckled and responded. ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam lol‚Äù¬†



A couple minutes later my shift was over. I clocked out, went home, and packed an overnight bag for Jane‚Äôs place. Her house was actually eight minutes closer to where I worked than my house, so I figured I might as well just stay at her place. Besides, there's nothing waiting for me back at home and I was kind of avoiding my girlfriend, if you couldn‚Äôt tell. She didn‚Äôt live far from where I did. I threw my bag in the backseat of my car and drove over to Jane‚Äôs.¬†



Once I got there I walked up to the door and bent down to grab the key under the doormat, thankfully it was there. I picked it up, unlocked the door, and stepped inside, locking the door behind me. The house was completely silent and cold. It felt kind of weird being here without her, but as Caspurr trotted up to me and rubbed his head against my pant leg I felt just a bit more comfortable. I crouched down to pet him and he bumped his face into my palm, demanding more attention. I caved, picking him up and holding his thin body in my arms. He‚Äôs an older cat, despite that he was still spunky and playful; I have to admit I was growing quite fond of the little guy.



I passed by the couch on the way to the living room and set him down before walking over to the fireplace and getting a fire started. I know I could tolerate the cold but I wanted to make sure Caspurr felt comfortable. Once the fire began to crackle he hopped off the couch and laid down on the carpet. I smiled down at him before pulling out my phone and taking a picture. Immediately I sent it to Jane. She replied with a simple ‚Äú<3‚Äù Followed with ‚ÄúCheck the fridge ;)‚Äù I went to the kitchen and pulled the fridge open. Sitting on the shelf in front of me was a plate of spaghetti wrapped in cling film, on it was a note that read ‚ÄúDinner for one.‚Äù

I chuckled and grabbed the plate before setting it down on the counter. I pulled the cling film off and walked it over to the microwave. I put it in for a minute, once it was done the timer beeped loudly, breaking the near dead silence. It was a little unsettling being alone in a house that wasn‚Äôt mine. It took a minute of me searching for the silverware drawer before I was actually¬† able to eat, I didn't remember where Jane had gotten them from earlier.



¬†Looking back on it I should have realized how spotty my memory was at the time. I did end up finding what I was looking for and was able to eat. I set my food down on the kitchen island and was about to start eating when I caught a glimpse of Caspurr‚Äôs bowl, it was empty. I did remember where Jane told me his food was, I walked over to the sink, bent down, and reached for the stack of cans. I grabbed one, shut the cabinet, and Caspurr came trotting in; his tail held high. He definitely recognized the sound as meaning that he was about to get fed. He waited impatiently by his bowl, not meowing, just staring at me. He wasn't very vocal, I actually haven‚Äôt heard him meow once. I opened the can and dumped its contents into the dish. He ducked his head down and immediately began eating. I smiled and walked over to the kitchen island, sitting down at the seat across from the window and looking out. My food was still warm enough to enjoy. Not only that but the beautiful view out the window made things feel serene, the solar lights out in the garden illuminated the plants in a mystical way. It outlined the various types of flora, Jane mentioned previously how passionate she was about gardening. The yard was full of flowers and herbs, the most notable were these beautiful white trumpet shaped flowers that grew up and around the fencing to her yard.



The spaghetti was delicious, I finished the plate pretty quickly. I thought it must have been loaded with pepper though, there were these grainy black specks in the sauce, but it didn‚Äôt taste very peppery.¬†

A couple minutes passed of me scrolling on my phone through social media before I decided to get up and wash my plate.¬†



As I stood I felt the strangest sensation. I was stationary, leaning against the counter, but it felt as if I had taken a step away from my body. My vision pulsed and swelled with light, everything seemed so much brighter. I felt myself falling and suddenly I was on my knees. I thought I saw Caspurr walk past me, but when I focused my vision I didn‚Äôt see him. I walked into the living room, despite the fire the temperature was the exact same as what it was in the kitchen. I made my way over to the couch and I could have sworn I bumped into something stationary and solid, but when I checked my surroundings there was nothing there. I threw myself down onto the couch, it hurt. It felt solid and cold, not like how it was before. As my eyes shut I thought I had heard the sound of distant meowing, a twinge of worry swelled in me as I began thinking that Caspurr could have gotten into something and needed help. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to stand, something in me demanded not to.¬†



At some point I must have passed out, I don‚Äôt remember being tired. When I awoke I was met with the sight of bright light and white tiles. I was laying on the kitchen floor, huddled underneath the island. At the time I knew for a fact that I had gotten up and went into the living room, I was so sure of it. Looking back I recall the sensation of how hard and uncomfortable the couch felt, and how cold everything was; I don‚Äôt think I actually ever left the kitchen. My body felt stiff and rigid as I sat up. After taking a moment to think and rationalize what could have happened I figured that what I was experiencing were withdrawal symptoms. At the beginning of October I had stopped abusing prescription medication completely, cold turkey. It was really hard at first, I wanted nothing more than to fall back into the cycle. There were a few slip ups now and then but nothing monumental, I was always told healing isn‚Äôt linear.¬†

This felt different though. I chalked it up to the fact that I hadn't used since the day before Jane and I started talking, maybe my body was just getting everything out of its system.¬†



Slowly and carefully I rose to my feet, using the island to balance myself. I could hear my heart beat thumping in my aching head. Fortunately the headache was only minor this time and quickly subsided. I looked down, seeing that my plate was still on the island, but it was not where I left it. My chair was pulled out and my plate now sat on the opposite side of the counter, far from where I was sitting when I ate. I thought that was odd but I must have moved it, there was no one else in the house but me after all.¬†



I washed my plate, put it in the dish rack, and glanced over at the clock display on the oven. It was past midnight. I was out for nearly five hours, it only felt like a blink of time though.¬†



‚ÄúJesus‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered to myself. I had work again tomorrow at eleven thirty, I should definitely call it a night. With that I made my way upstairs, carrying my overnight bag with me. There was a spare bedroom across the hall. I figured it would probably be best to sleep there rather than in Jane‚Äôs bed; that just seemed weird. I threw my bag down on the floor next to the bed, leaving the door open so Caspurr could come cuddle with me if he felt like it; figured the little fella might get lonely since his owner was away. The fire in the living room had long died down, so I figured it didn't need to be tended to anymore. As I laid down on the bed I pulled my phone out and checked for notifications. I had one from Jane and three from my girlfriend. The one from Jane read, ‚ÄúHope things are going well! I‚Äôll be home before you know it \^\_\^‚Äù¬†



I smiled and began to type up a response. ‚ÄúAll is well, can‚Äôt wait to see you again. Goodnight.‚Äù

My phone buzzed and another text from Natalie popped up. ‚ÄúWhere have you been, you seem so distant lately.‚Äù The other three from her were similar. All something along the lines of. ‚ÄúI'm free this weekend.‚Äù or¬† ‚ÄúWe should make plans.‚Äù We have been dating for almost a year now, and didn't live together but before I met Jane I was spending almost every night over at her house. Before I could type up a response my phone began to ring, it was Natalie. I answered and heard her voice on the other end.¬†



‚ÄúHey.‚Äù She said flatly.

‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù I responded

‚ÄúI miss you.‚Äù She spoke again after a short break of silence.¬†

‚ÄúI miss you too, sorry about not making time to spend with you.‚Äù It was true, I really did feel guilty.

‚ÄúNah it‚Äôs alright, I get it. But hey, I'm free this Friday; we should go grab dinner.‚Äù Her voice was soft and poignant.

‚ÄúThat would be great. I‚Äôll find a nice spot and send you the address, let‚Äôs meet there.‚Äù That was the plan I had come up with, I couldn‚Äôt avoid her forever.¬†

‚ÄúAwesome, sounds like a plan‚Ä¶I love you.‚Äù She spoke again, this time more gingerly.¬†

‚ÄúI love you too, see you friday.‚Äù My voice lowered as our conversation ended, she hung up and I tossed my phone on the nightstand. Friday was a ways away, today was only monday. Technically now Tuesday since it was past midnight.¬†



A pit of guilt and remorse began to form deep in my chest the longer I thought about what I was doing. How I was sleeping at Jane‚Äôs while my girlfriend was missing me more and more. I know I should have prioritized her, I really wished I would have. None of this would have happened if I just remained faithful to Natalie.¬†



Eventually I was able to drift off to sleep, the first night alone at Jane‚Äôs was relatively uneventful. I slept through the whole night, only waking up once early in the morning as a result of Caspurr cuddling up to my face. The both of us fell asleep and didn‚Äôt wake again until my alarm went off at ten AM. Caspurr was no longer in the bed with me, I wasn't surprised. He was probably in the kitchen waiting for breakfast. However, as I stood up I noticed that the bedroom door was now shut. It gave me a weird feeling but I figured it must have been Caspurr‚Äôs doing. I opened the door and began my path to the kitchen, through the hall, then down the stairs, and through the living room. Eventually I ended up in the kitchen where I was met with the sight of Caspurr sitting by his bowl. I couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle at the sight. Before making myself coffee I grabbed his food from under the sink and emptied the can into his bowl. He looked up at me and wiggled his tail, I think it was a sign of gratitude.¬†



It took a good five minutes of me digging through the cabinets until I found the coffee Jane mentioned I was welcomed to. And then another five figuring out how to work the fancy coffee pot, eventually it was ready. I stood staring out the window sipping my coffee for what only felt like a couple minutes. I ended up glancing over at the time on the oven clock and it read ten fifty five.¬†

‚ÄúDamn!‚Äù¬†

How could that much time have passed? I didn‚Äôt think that was possible until I looked down at Caspurr‚Äôs bowl and saw that it was completely empty, my mug was as well. It felt like I had just started drinking it. At the time I just disregarded all that and focused on the fact that I had to get to work or else I was going to be late. I rushed out the door, hurriedly locking it behind me; putting the key in my back pocket. I sped out the driveway and rushed to work. It was a fifteen minute drive but I got there faster than I thought I would. Once I made my way into the building I clocked in and took a seat at my desk. As I sat the chair squeaked, it sounded eerily similar to a meow.¬†



Hours passed and before I knew it my shift was over. It was now five thirty five. It took me a bit longer to get my things together today but I did end up making my way over to Jane‚Äôs house. I was feeling hesitant about staying the night there but I at least wanted to go over and check up on Caspurr. So I did. I pulled up into the driveway and made my way to the front door, reached into my back pocket for the key and-... It wasn‚Äôt there. I panicked for a bit and began quickly checking my other pockets. I did find it. But it was in my front left pocket. I distinctly recall putting it in my back pocket, why would my brain have made that up?¬†



After I entered the house I realized that it was freezing cold inside, nearly the same temperature it was outside. I rushed over to the fireplace and got a fire going, next I began searching for Caspurr; I wanted to make sure he was alright, I did eventually find him curled up under a blanket in Jane‚Äôs bed. He stretched and followed me out to the kitchen, I would feed him and then leave after that. After cleaning and refilling his food and water dishes I noticed my mug from this morning was sitting in the dish drain, clean. I did not wash it before I left for work. At least, I didn‚Äôt remember washing it.

¬†It honestly freaked me out. I did more research online, trying to verify what I thought in my head; and some of the weird things I had been experiencing were consistent with the symptoms of withdrawal. I didn‚Äôt want my paranoia to get the best of me so I just decided to ride it out.¬†

¬†I wish I hadn‚Äôt.¬†



I licked my lips and realized that my mouth was extremely dry. I remember Jane offering me sweet tea the first night we spent at her house; at the time I denied her offer but now it sounded tempting. I figured it was still in the fridge. I checked and low and behold, there it was. Full and sitting on the bottom shelf. I poured myself a full glass and sat at the kitchen island, sipping it and scrolling on my phone. Caspurr finished his food and trotted out of the kitchen, making his way towards the warmth emanating from the living room. I began to follow him, but I heard something, a meow. It wasn‚Äôt coming from the living room though, it came from outside the window. It sounded muffled, like it was coming from a bit of a distance. My head turned towards the window but my body didn‚Äôt move.

¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a stray cat.‚Äù I told myself, trying to rationalize. I tried to ignore it and walked into the living room and joined Caspurr- who was sitting on the rug in front of a fireplace. I sat next to him and reached up to the end table and switched the tv on to a random channel. A sitcom was playing and I immediately changed it, the laugh tracks always creeped me out. I ended up deciding on some nature channel. After an hour or so of watching tv I decided to order takeout, the only thing open at this time was a Chinese restaurant. I scrolled through the menu and placed my order.



About fifteen minutes later I heard a knock at the door, I opened it and my food was there‚Ä¶just sitting on the front doorstep tied up in a grocery bag. I peeked my head out and looked around but there was no one in sight. I shrugged it off and picked up the food, brought it inside, and sat down on the couch to eat.¬†



I finished and decided it was time to head out, the fire had been going long enough to keep things adequately warm for Caspurr to be comfortable for the night. I didn't want to leave any of the space heaters running while I wasn't here. As I stood up to snuff out the fire I heard a knock at the door. I jumped, I wasn't expecting anyone at this time. I was hesitant to open it so I peeked out the window to see who it was, it was the delivery man. I felt my heat sink into my stomach and an overwhelming sense of dread flooded my system. My stomach turned over with nausea and anxiety. Reluctantly, I opened the door and was greeted by the person on the other side. After that it felt as if everything had happened so quickly.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I think there's been a mix up. My food was already delivered.‚Äù¬†

The delivery guy looked confused.

‚ÄúThis is 357 Oakwood?‚Äù He asked.

I nodded slowly and reached my hand out, grabbing the food that was being handed to me. I nervously thanked him and closed the door behind me as I walked into the living room. What I saw made my blood run cold. The now empty to-go boxes I was eating out of that were sitting on the coffee table were gone. My hand opened and locked up, causing the food I was holding to hit the ground. My breath quickened as I sprinted to the kitchen and nearly ripped off the lid of the trashcan to check inside. The only thing in the bag were empty cat food cans. The kitchen lights now seemed violently bright and my head felt as if it were being split in half. I groaned and clamped my palm over my eyes, trying to shield them from the light. I could hear the tv playing loudly, a deafening laugh track echoing throughout the whole house. I tried to step back but stumbled, tripping over my own feet. I felt my back hit the tile, hard, it knocked the wind out of me. I don‚Äôt fully remember what I was thinking at the time, I just recall trying to shout for help, but no words were coming from my mouth, just gasps. I could hear Caspurr meowing repeatedly from behind me, it sounded like he was on top of my head. I threw an arm out, trying to reach for him, but I couldn't feel anything; just tile.¬†



I passed out again, this time when I woke up the sun was just starting to rise. I didn‚Äôt wake up in the kitchen though, I awoke in a cold sweat on the living room floor. I didn‚Äôt even bother trying to sit up, I just laid there on the ground for a moment, trying to make sense of what was happening to me. Eventually I did get up, noticing that the fire was no longer burning. I assumed that it just fizzled out, probably for the best anyway if I wasn't there to tend to it. I inspected my surroundings further and realized that the tv was still on, playing a nature channel. I felt a chill run down my spine. I swallowed hard, turned the tv off, went to the kitchen to feed Caspurr, and rushed out the house. I locked the door behind me and got in my car, gripping the steering wheel tightly. I sat there in silence for a while as the sun rose.¬†



After a while I decided to call Natalie. It was seven AM but I thought maybe she would still pick up‚Ä¶she didn‚Äôt. I sat alone in my car for a few more minutes before pulling out of the driveway and heading home. It was about a twenty minute drive from my house to Jane‚Äôs. Once I made it to my apartment and basically threw myself through the door, slamming it behind me. My body ached, probably because I had ended up sleeping, or rather passing out, on the floor so many times. I checked my phone again, there was a notification; it was from Jane. It read, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget to water my plants please!‚Äù¬†

Shit, I had completely forgotten. I took a seat on the couch and replied with something along the lines of, ‚ÄúYep, thanks for the reminder.‚Äù There was no way in hell I was going back to that house at that moment, I'd just do it after work.



Eventually it was time for me to head out, eleven fifteen, and I made my way to work. Another pretty uneventful day, things went smoothly and the shift rolled by at a regular pace. I thought the stress of detox and house sitting was just starting to weigh on me, spending some time at my own place really helped relieve some of the anxiety I had building up. I clocked out, got in my car, and drove over to Jane‚Äôs. About half way there I decided to smoke a cigarette, I hadn't done that in a while, I was trying to ween off it a bit; just another drop of vice in my ocean of bad habits. I didn‚Äôt realize until I began to smoke it that the paper of the cigarette was crinkled, not to mention the tobacco was loosely packed in there compared to the others. It gave me an uneasy feeling. As I was pulling up to the stoplight I decided to snuff it out after a couple puffs. When I looked up again I almost began to cry. I was now sitting in Jane‚Äôs driveway.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck‚Ä¶. WHAT THE FUCK!‚Äù¬†

I could feel myself trembling uncontrollably and my voice sounded distant. I have absolutely no recollection of the rest of the drive there. I just blinked and suddenly‚Ä¶ I was at Jane‚Äôs house. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, how does someone even begin to handle a situation like that. After a bout of panic and hyperventilating eventually I stepped out of my car, knees feeling weak and atrophied. Each step I took towards the garden felt like it took years to complete.¬†

‚ÄúWater plants, feed Caspurr, turn on the heater, go home.‚Äù

I repeated this phrase out loud to myself over and over as I carefully stepped around potted plants and raised garden beds. Next thing I knew I was standing on her patio, looking down at two watering cans. Deciding which one to use felt like such a heavy decision for me to make, they were both nearly identical, one looking slightly more used than the other. I bent down, aiming to grab the older looking one. When I wrapped my fingers around the handle I felt my skin brush against itself, I focused on what I was doing and realized that I was making a fist; empty handed.¬†

‚ÄúWha-‚Äù¬†

The word was shallow and breathy, echoing throughout my head. I winced and looked up at the sky, the sun was beginning to set now. Before looking down again I repeated the phase I tried to burn into my memory.¬†

‚ÄúWater plants, feed Caspurr, turn on the heater, go home.‚Äù

When I looked down again I felt another fit rising inside me. There was only one watering can. Because of the position I was in when I attempted to stand I fell flat on my ass. It took a bit of me scrambling around on the concrete but eventually I was able to make it to my feet, but when I stood up again and blinked I was now laying on the ground. I didn‚Äôt remember falling down again. Not only that, but my whole body screamed with aches. It felt as if I had just run a marathon. Upon further inspection my arms and legs were full of bruises. The more my senses came to the more I realized that something was very very wrong. It wasn‚Äôt light outside anymore, the only thing illuminating the space around me was a flood light mounted above the back door. There was a chill in the air, I shivered and realized that I was wet, my pants were wet; as if I had sat in a puddle. I opened my mouth to say something but couldn‚Äôt. My mouth was bone dry. I brought a hand up to my lips and realized that there was crusted drool streaking down the side of my face.I must have been laying there for hours, I didn‚Äôt know what time it was, all I knew was that it was dark; and cold. It‚Äôs hard to recall exactly what I did at that moment but I do remember crying and grasping at the ground, making some attempt to hold onto the reality that was slipping away from me.



I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I couldn‚Äôt call my girlfriend and ask her to come pick me up from my mistress's house because I was experiencing some psychological break. So I called Kevin instead. He is one of my very few friends, I met him back in college before I dropped out. He knew I was cheating on Natalie with Jane and made it blatantly clear that he did not approve. But I was there for him during his hard times, so I assumed he would be there for me. I gave him a call and thanked god whenever he picked up the phone and I heard his voice on the other end.

‚ÄúYo, Daniel, I haven't heard from you in a minute. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI need some help man. I need you to come get me‚Äù My voice was hoarse and shaky.

I could hear him smack his lips and sigh.

‚ÄúYou at that girl‚Äôs house huh?‚Äù He sounded like a disappointed parent.¬†

‚ÄúY-Yeah‚Ä¶ I think I need to go to the hospital.‚Äù

His tone quickly shifted¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the address, I'm heading over now.‚Äù

‚Äú357 Oakwood.‚Äù

We said our goodbyes and hung up. I didn‚Äôt know how far away his house was from Jane‚Äôs but it felt like he got there pretty quickly. I could see him pull up in the driveway from behind the house and I walked over to his car, getting in the passenger seat. As I closed the door I could see his face scrunch up, like he smelled something sour. He looked at me, down at my lap, and then back up to my face.¬†

‚ÄúYou alright man?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything to him. I just shook my head no. His expression changed to concerned and sympathetic.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I might be going insane.‚Äù

My voice broke as I spoke to him, trying not to break down crying.¬†

He didn‚Äôt say anything in regards to that but I felt his hand squeeze my shoulder.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get you to the hospital.‚Äù

I nodded and leaned my head back against the headrest, closing my eyes. I figured he didn't question me much because he knew about my past struggle with addiction and the detox I was going through.¬†

For most of my life I struggled with codependency and stayed in draining friendships because I didn‚Äôt know how to set boundaries. Over the last couple of years I‚Äôve been doing the hard work: therapy, CoDA meetings, and learning to hold healthier limits. Part of that meant pulling back from my parents; our relationship has always been difficult, and for my own peace I now keep contact minimal.

A year ago, I stepped away from the friends I had because those relationships weren‚Äôt healthy either. I truly believed that once I created space, the right people would come in. Since then I‚Äôve thrown myself into new things: salsa dancing, tennis lessons, scuba diving, volunteering, different Meetup groups, church communities, and fitness classes. I didn‚Äôt just sample them: I stuck with many of these for close to or more than a year. I keep showing up, but I still come home to an empty phone, with no one to call for a simple coffee or a walk.

The deal was that if we read the Book of Mormon and listened to some podcasts then her and my dad would pay for a year of our car insurance. That is a fuck ton of money for me right now. 

She said that they were doing this because they thought it would help straighten our testimonies. Now my dudes, I have been out of the church for over a year now and I have been debating when I should tell them. but I was scared that they would push back. And I‚Äôm not in a place where I can take arguing with them over such heavy stuff. Especially with my deconstruction so new and raw. 

But in that moment I thought it was now or never. So over a plate of spaghetti I told my Molly Mormon mother that I was leaving the church. This is more or less how it went:

‚Äúyeah we should probably talk about that‚Ä¶‚Äù by now my hands are shaking and I‚Äôm trying to hide behind my fork. ‚ÄúSo you know how we are not supposed to go to any sources that aren‚Äôt the church? Well I did, and I learned some things that caused me to lose my faith.‚Äù

My mom gives me a reassuring smile 

‚Äúyeah I figured‚Äù

‚ÄúWha?‚Äù I asked dumbly. 

‚ÄúBased on a lot of things you said and the fact that you are drinking coffee and alcohol I guessed‚Äù

We talk for a while about my reasons for leaving but I don‚Äôt give any specifics because that‚Äôs a lot of information to dump on someone at 11pm on a Tuesday. 

But what really surprised me is that she is open to looking at my sources and having discussions with me. She said that she is solid in her testimony and she doesn‚Äôt think it can be shaken by learning what I know. 

That‚Äôs what everybody says then they end up on r/exmormon lol. 

She also told me that if I do read the Book of Mormon and listen to her favorite podcasts then no matter if I chose to stay in the church or not they will still give me the money. She wanted to make it clear that she wasn‚Äôt bribing me to stay in the church, she was bribing me to give it one last shot. Then if I still want to leave then she will respect my decision and never bring it up again. 

By now I am physically relieved. I was expecting to be interrogated Criminal Minds style and sit through hours of them bearing their testimony and guilt tripping me into thinking that I‚Äôm ruining my life. 

But instead she told me ‚Äúno matter what you decide I will always love you. And even without the church you are still a good person that doesn‚Äôt change‚Äù

At that Ladies and Gentleman, i couldn‚Äôt hold it in anymore. Tears were welling in my eyes and I couldn‚Äôt speak through the lump in my throat. 

My mom notices and whispers ‚Äúoh honey‚Äù she gets up to give me a hug and I broke down. Full on sobbing into her shoulder as she holds me and tells me that I‚Äôm a good person, that she loves me, and no matter what happens I will always be her daughter. 

I‚Äôm crying just typing this out. 

While she held me, I told her about how much guilt I was carrying. And how even though I don‚Äôt believe in it anymore, I felt like I was breaking up their eternal family. 

She said that she believes that God has a plan and even if I leave the church, we will still be sealed as a family and be together forever. 

Which is good for her, and good for me, because I don‚Äôt have to feel like I‚Äôm making them mourn the death of my soul. 

So yeah, I call that a success. I think I‚Äôm going to accept her challenge. A year of free car insurance is too good to pass up. I have read the Book of Mormon all the way through like 10 times growing up so I‚Äôm not sure what she thinks will happen the 11th time, but whatever. 

I‚Äôm glad that I finally told her it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I don‚Äôt think it could have gone any better than it did. Besides having my dad there probably. I‚Äôm sure my mom has already told him but I‚Äôm planning on having a face to face conversation with him when he gets back. 

TLDR: I told my mom that I was leaving the church.  She said that she will always love me no matter what, and I cried like a baby in her arms.

I am dealing with a work situation and am in need of some advice before going to a lawyer. I started a great job a month and a half ago and was really enjoying it until a fateful day where multiple ridiculous things occurred. A much older male coworker asked me if I was wearing a bra under my suit and tried to look down my top in front of another employee so both of us reported it to my supervisor. My supervisor said he would deal with it but after he spoke to the coworker that asked about my bra, he walked back over to me and told me that the reason why he asked me that was because I was too comfortable talking with him and that he left to cool off after being angered. That was supposed to be him ‚Äúsolving‚Äù it and I was obviously not happy so I went to his superior and told him what happened and went back to the desk to get my bag crying. My supervisor freaked out seeing me crying and saying I was leaving for the day because the higher ups said I could go. He physically gets between me and the doorway and says I can‚Äôt go until I hear him explain himself and I tell him why I‚Äôm upset. I‚Äôm sobbing at this point and telling him I just want to leave and don‚Äôt want to explain but he doesn‚Äôt let me go until I tell him. Then he opens the front door and asks if I want an uber and I say no and walk as fast as I can away from the building. 

I then emailed the full situation from the bra comment to the being held against my will issue to the higher ups I spoke to. No response for three days and I send in my resignation that says that I don‚Äôt want to quit but don‚Äôt feel safe returning to work under my supervisor. Finally HR gets to me and tells me she will get a written apology from them and that they don‚Äôt want me to quit. The CEO asks to have coffee with me and then during coffee he tells me to give him a ‚Äúlist of demands‚Äù and the insinuation is that he wants me to just move on from the situation and forget about it. HR says that my supervisor denies ever stopping me from leaving and we email back and forth as she keeps saying I agree that he blocked me from leaving on accident and I am very clear that the incident was intentional. They‚Äôve ghosted me for the last week after I reiterated what happened. 

I want to sue or at least file a formal complaint but I have no proof that he blocked me from leaving only that I submitted a formal complaint about it. I can prove the sexual harassment because I got an apology for it but I‚Äôm worried that without the security tapes or anything that it won‚Äôt hold any weight. Nobody was there it was just my supervisor and I. Everything was over email and there is a 10 minute gap in between me talking to HR and me leaving and my supervisor blowing my phone up with calls after I left. Do I have a leg to stand on? 

tldr; I was sexually harassed at work and then held at work against my will when I tried to leave. Reported the full incident to HR but they deny that the second event happened. I say I won‚Äôt return to work working under both people but I can stay if I am relocated but job stopped answering. ",0,1759967863.0,legaladvicecanada,43,0.33,False

Telling someone you had really great coffee this morning. That you tried a new cereal and liked it. That you saw a really cool bird on the way to work. And, of course, have someone comfortable and close enough to you to share the same kinda things with you.

 But, I don't wanna do that alone. I want someone with me along the ride. But I likely never will. I'm like the exact opposite of someone you'd want in your life.

About me: Writer (Honors Creative Writing Major going for MFA) and artist, nerdy and athletic. Catholic. I like RPGs, anime, cooking pasta, gym and long walks, bookstores and park dates. My books and manga are in the last picture! I am big into Japanese culture, language, and tradition. I plan dates, keep promises, and do my best to represent the good man I am. Sometimes I do tease, so be warned. Big into RPGS and things like Final Fantasy and Baldur's Gate and DnD.

Values: Loyalty, family, patience, equality, and playfulness. I date to marry and am monogamous. We can discuss boundaries early. I‚Äôm saving myself and want someone who‚Äôs waiting too. If you're someone who takes relationships seriously and laugh easily, we'll probably get along.

Looking for: A kind, good-natured, and nerdy woman who wants to build something lasting. We would have long conversations, inside jokes, ramen and anime nights. Maybe couples cosplay one day!

Appearance: I stay fit and work best with someone similarly health-minded (slim to athletic). A woman with a cute, attractive face and beautiful eyes are my weakness. I appreciate beauty, but I value the person.

Details: Age 20‚Äì30. I‚Äôm in Indiana (EST). U.S only or Japan works if we‚Äôre working toward a long-term goal. DM with pic/age/location (or link your post). A good first date would be a video call! Or a bookstore/coffee shop in person. I mainly use discord.

1o1r3z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NerdDating/comments/1o1r3z1/27_m4f_usa_wanting_a_fun_and_longterm_relationship/,27 [M4F] USA Wanting a fun and long-term relationship.,"TL;DR: Looking for a best friend with wife energy. Someone fun but serious about a relationship.

About me: Writer (Honors Creative Writing Major going for MFA) and artist, nerdy and athletic. Catholic. I like RPGs, anime, cooking pasta, gym and long walks, bookstores and park dates. My books and manga are in the last picture! I am big into Japanese culture, language, and tradition. I plan dates, keep promises, and do my best to represent the good man I am. Sometimes I do tease, so be warned. Big into RPGS and things like Final Fantasy and Baldur's Gate and DnD.

Values: Loyalty, family, patience, equality, and playfulness. I date to marry and am monogamous. We can discuss boundaries early. I‚Äôm saving myself and want someone who‚Äôs waiting too. If you're someone who takes relationships seriously and laugh easily, we'll probably get along.

Looking for: A kind, good-natured, and nerdy woman who wants to build something lasting. We would have long conversations, inside jokes, ramen and anime nights. Maybe couples cosplay one day!

Appearance: I stay fit and work best with someone similarly health-minded (slim to athletic). A woman with a cute, attractive face and beautiful eyes are my weakness. I appreciate beauty, but I value the person.

Details: Age 20‚Äì30. I‚Äôm in Indiana (EST). U.S only or Japan works if we‚Äôre working toward a long-term goal. DM with pic/age/location (or link your post). A good first date would be a video call! Or a bookstore/coffee shop in person. I mainly use discord.

\*Graphics Card Disclaimer: I have a 1050 Ti laying around and I can always move my Intel Arc B580 over to this ITX when I upgrade the GPU in my main Daily Driver.

Should I make this ITX Build with a Portable Monitor or get a Laptop?

Laptops are less upgradable and sometimes have slower components. Portable screen can be upgraded, maybe get an OLED at some point. Should I go used Macbook M1 or etc? Affordable Macs have small screens to me (14in). Laptops are an easy to use all in one package, no separate keyboards and monitors.

Basic office use case as well as recording a podcast. Light editing nothing heavy, I have a bigger rig for that. Not a student so not that mobile. Coffee shop trips, friends house (for the podcast), the rare (once a year) vacation.

I hope this letter will help Minjeong forget her hard memories and find peace of mind, even if only for a moment. First of all, you've worked hard since your debut until now! There must have been times when you wanted to give up and times when life wasn't going well, but thank you for persevering! MY has faced many difficult times, too.

Because, I'm someone who wouldn't have been able to endure without you. I'm currently preparing for the CSAT. Every day was the same: studying, exercising, repeat. It felt like an endless tunnel. ""Why do I have to do this?"" ""Why do I have to live?"" Thoughts like these constantly plagued me. I truly felt like I was falling apart every single day. I had no idea where to go, or what I should live for. But then, there was someone who came to me like a light. That person was Winter, you...

About me: Writer (Honors Creative Writing Major going for MFA) and artist, nerdy and athletic. Catholic. I like RPGs, anime, cooking pasta, gym and long walks, bookstores and park dates. My books and manga are in the last picture! I am big into Japanese culture, language, and tradition. I plan dates, keep promises, and do my best to represent the good man I am. Sometimes I do tease, so be warned. Big into RPGS and things like Final Fantasy and Baldur's Gate and DnD.

Values: Loyalty, family, patience, equality, and playfulness. I date to marry and am monogamous. We can discuss boundaries early. I‚Äôm saving myself and want someone who‚Äôs waiting too. If you're someone who takes relationships seriously and laugh easily, we'll probably get along.

Looking for: A kind, good-natured, and nerdy woman who wants to build something lasting. We would have long conversations, inside jokes, ramen and anime nights. Maybe couples cosplay one day!

Appearance: I stay fit and work best with someone similarly health-minded (slim to athletic). A woman with a cute, attractive face and beautiful eyes are my weakness. I appreciate beauty, but I value the person.

Details: Age 20‚Äì30. I‚Äôm in Indiana (EST). U.S only or Japan works if we‚Äôre working toward a long-term goal. DM with pic/age/location (or link your post). A good first date would be a video call! Or a bookstore/coffee shop in person. I mainly use discord.

1o1r2em,https://www.reddit.com/r/braincancer/comments/1o1r2em/pcv_liver_and_sugar_issues/,"PCV, Liver, and Sugar issues","Hi, 24F with grade 3 Oligo currently undergoing PCV chemo after 6 weeks of radiation back in March-April.

(Some background on me: I don't get out much and spend a lot of time working at my PC since I had to quit my physical job due to my diagnosis. I often forget to exercise and go through a lot of coffee due to being a chronic workaholic. I get mildly dehydrated a lot.)

I've been feeling mostly fine throughout the 3 cycles I've done, but when I was supposed to start cycle 4, it was delayed by two weeks. But I was made aware after my most recent blood test this week that my liver numbers have been going up throughout the month of September, ever since my last infusion, even when I wasn't on any chemo. They were at \~50 on the 9th, then at \~130 last week, followed by \~150 this Monday.

Granted, I was at the Universal parks the week before the 9th, and after that, my childhood cat died, so I was breaking my usual sugar rules last month - I try to stick to a maximum of 25mg added sugar per day if I want treats, and a general 100 carb daily limit. (Please do not turn this into a discussion about low-carb diets.)

I'd like to know if the liver is more sensitive to sugar during this treatment, or if the medication just \*does this\* and maybe cycle 4 ends up being my last cycle so I still have a functional liver after this.

Also looking for opinions on if I shouldn't reach that 25mg limit \*every day\*, because that's what it's turned into with all the stress. I've accidentally turned it into a goal rather than a restriction, seeing what all I can fit in under the number. I'm worried that's the cause of the rising number, since I wasn't as lax prior to that vacation.

I'm young, giving it up completely is difficult for me... but trying to make change!",1,1759967100.0,braincancer,0,1.0,False

We were so attached to the hip by high school even though or friendship came and went the years we were younger, that we said when we get boyfriends they‚Äôll likely have to be best friends themselves. We didn‚Äôt get boyfriends but we stayed close through college. Something weird whenever a guy commented on my Instagram post she‚Äôd be the first to ask me about it or say she saw it. There was a guy who added me from school, he commented on so many posts and in hindsight it was odd, but she automatically mentioned it. She saw a different guy text me, asked if it was the one from our class. All of a sudden she‚Äôs texting him. 

We never spoke about that but I felt this divide between us. She began being friends with this group who partied a lot. That was never our scene so I guess that‚Äôs why she didn‚Äôt ask me to come along. I still asked her to hang out, we did go to a party together but it was never the same. I just unadded her because she didn‚Äôt make an effort to talk to me and we were ending college anyway. So years later she views my Instagram story even though she doesn‚Äôt follow me. And then my mom said her brother is having a wedding and we were invited. We go and I see her, we talk. We meet up for coffee because we said we would. She told me at the time where we stopped being friends she had this boyfriend who from what I get was in a bad place mentally and she had to help him. Then she had another bf who lied about his age while they were together and some other stuff.


Anyway I tried to bring up how our friendship ended but she looked uncomfortable. We were supposed to meet up again but she deleted her socials where I followed her. I looked her up and found an account where it looks like she‚Äôs engaged to a different guy but he went to our school and I know he lives somewhere far so idk if I should reach out?

1o1qwbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1o1qwbi/i_was_told_that_my_relationship_with_my_therapist/,I was told that my relationship with my therapist is unethically entangled?,"7 or 8 years ago I started seeing a therapist as part of my school's mental health programme. This was arranged by my lecturers and friends who kind of expedited the process because I was not doing great (to put it mildly). Me and my therapist clicked off and have been doing monthy to bi monthly sessions depending on time and need and I consider her a personal friend.   

I've recently started trauma therapy training (non medical - or board certified psychology yet, so legally I won't be able to diagnose or call myself psychologist) given my C-PTSD and experience as an activist that sort of ended up offering support to people anyway (I was the person receiving emails from trans teens kicked from their home and forced to do sex work, or compiling hate crimes and connecting the people who contacted us with proper resources, to the point our social security equivalent would sometimes call me to handle something and the place I did volunteering at was listed in their website at resources) and upon starting classes and mentioning to my lecturer some of the stuff my therapist has done for me the supervisor called it unhetical and a clear violation of guidelines.

So here's a short list of stuff that my therapist has done beyond the sessions:

1 - When I expressed frustration at my clinical team's treatment of my gender dysphoria wrote me a letter to hand to my Psych basically reinforcing how much I needed it and started a back and forth with him with me as a sort of ""carrier pigeon"" that resulted in me getting refered to the gender clinic.

2 - Accompanied me to the hospital for my first sexology appointment. Paid for the cab to take us back to university (since we both had to go there anyway).

3 - When I was kicked out of home she was the point of contact between social services at my university and me, managing to find me a room.

4 - Knowing that the university would be closed in August and I needed a room she contacted 5 or 6 charities, shelters, social institutions trying to find me a solution, often meeting with them in person to plead my case and or meeting me there.

5 - She lent me money knowing I had no way of paying it back while I was unhoused and not eating. ""don't worry about it"" - she has never brought it up and when I offer to pay her back she says she thinks feeding someone in need is a much better use of money than anything she can think of.

6 - When University acted against the law and refused to recognise my legal name change, id and request to house me in the female dormitory she stood up for me - despite being employed by the university - walking with me into the meeting with the dean. Later she told me she was proud of how I articulated my points.

7 - She was in contact with my hospital psych and gender care team. When I needed a document so my special needs would be recognised institutionally at university she was the one who offered to write an email to my care team explaining just what documents we needed.

8 - When I finished university despite the fact that I was no longer her patient, she set me up as an external patient at her office. In 3 or 4 years she has refused to let me pay her once. When I asked about it she said that ""I can make my own financial decisions, and I don't see you as a burden.

9 - Even after moving countries she chose to keep seeing me online.

10 -  She has made her phone available at any hour day or night for emergencies. In fact I once called her at 11pm and she met me at the hospital after a suicide attempt.

  
11- We're not only social media friends she often comments my posts. I have no problem with this, of course, and never hid who my therapist was.

11 - She wrote me a letter of recommendation when I applied to the trauma therapy degree.

When I shared this with the person who is (hopefully) to be my supervisor she said that that wasn't ""going above and beyond"" it literally spoke of a sort of interpersonal relationship and friendship that is unethical and likely reason to terminate our sessions. She said that my therapist was acting as social worker, therapist and mother and often doing it out of scope for her role in my treatment.

 I have read the ethics code at my local country by which board certified therapists should hold themselves to but none of it seems obviously out of scope or broken. In fact it would be more accurate to say that since she doesn't bill me at all and we do our sessions over coffee at her office, outside the scope of medicalised practice - (she has never diagnosed me, and or written reports herself, to any doctor) I'm not even sure if this fits within the scope of psychotherapy. in the traditional sense.

I am wondering how much of this fits within the parameters of a healthy relationship with a therapist. My counselour used the word ""parasocial"". Would your read on it be similar? ",0,1759966611.0,TalkTherapy,2,0.5,False

I hope you're doing well. I'm here to talk about something that's been making my life a living hell. Before we get into it, please be kind and patient with me. the guilt is already eating me alive from the inside.

I'm 28 (F), and my husband is 39 (M); we‚Äôve been married for four years. We‚Äôre both English teachers and met at a school where I was a maternity leave replacement for four months. We connected quickly, and our first year of marriage was amazing. He was the man of my dreams intellectual, caring, and so romantic. Our relationship was wonderful; we were incredibly close, sharing everything with each other.

For personal reasons I won't mention, his mother never actually liked me and would harass me every time we visited. I'd tell him, and he‚Äôd console me, but he always refused to stand up for me, even though it was clear she was in the wrong. The tension finally broke when his parents returned from Hajj. We spent a week in their house to congratulate them, and his mother wouldn‚Äôt stop embarrassing me and saying terrible things about me in front of her family and guests. That was my last straw. I exploded at her, yelling in her face and calling her nameswhich, to be honest, I wasn‚Äôt supposed to do, but I was absolutely furious. My husband got mad and slapped me in front of her. It was the first time he‚Äôd ever laid a hand on me.

I immediately went to my family‚Äôs house, and we went no-contact for a while. Eventually, he came, apologized to both me and my family, and I returned home with him, but with specific conditions. But ever since, it's never been the same. We've been distant. He no longer shares anything with me, even though I've been trying to fix things. Financially, he takes good care of us, but so much has changed. He‚Äôd be out all day, hardly picking up my calls, and making up excuses when I complained. For context, we live in a different wilaya than my hometown, so I‚Äôve been feeling extremely lonely, he was my only friend here.

This distance went on for six months until the new school year started. We both work as teachers, but he's at a public high school, and I'm at a private one. This separation just led to us becoming even more distant.

This year, a new teacher came to my school. This happens all the time, of course, but this one was different. Let's call him S to not mention names. He was a good-looking gentleman, probably around my age, dressed so classy he stood out and had everyone's attention. The fact he was sociable helped me get to know people faster, including him, though I kept everything professional. This went on for about a week. Since he was new, he had problems and would ask for help, seeing I was the only teacher close to his age. I'd help him occasionally, and that got us talking more often, but everyone just saw it as two teachers exchanging professional notes.

At the same time, my relationship with my husband was deteriorating; we'd talk for an hour a day at most. S and I exchanged contacts, and I could see his Instagram profile with photos from his studies and trips in Europe. We started answering each other's stories and all that. He was smart, genuine, and knew exactly how to say the right thing to make me laugh something my husband hasn't been doing lately.

One night, my mother-in-law called to say she was coming over with her two daughters to see a famous doctor in our city. I declined the visit immediately because of the condition I had set. He got furious, and we had a huge fight. Things escalated quickly, and he said incredibly hurtful things about my family things I had told him in confidence in the past. That night, I couldn't sleep; I cried my eyes out and watched my marriage break down right before my eyes. The next morning, we didn't speak. He left without driving me to work, and I went in alone, feeling incredibly sad, and it clearly showed on my face.

Next day, I got to work feeling terrible. I tried to pretend everything was fine. But by the end of that day, S noticed and asked if I was okay a question my husband hasn't asked. That caught me off guard, and in that moment of vulnerability, I admitted I wasn't okay and had problems. He genuinely asked if I'd be able to get home in that state and offered to drive me. I wanted to say no, but I couldn't, and I ended up saying yes.

We both finished at the same time, so he drove me. On the road, he said I looked tired and needed to eat, so he insisted we stop at a coffee shop just to grab something. I gave in, and there, we started talking and he asked me what was really going on, and in that moment of weakness, I exploded with tears. All the pain and sadness I had kept in for the past year came out at once. He was shocked but supportive and listened carefully. He held my hand all along, and at some point, he pulled me closer and hugged me for about a minute. I didn't push him back i wasn't in the right state of mind. He was so sympathetic, and that made me open up even more.

But then, I realized what I did was wrong. I got up and wanted to leave. He offered to drive me back home, but I refused and took a taxi. I was already upset, and the guilt made it worse.

My husband came back earlier than usual that day and apologized for all he had said. He brought me a little gift and offered to take me out for dinner. I couldn't look him in the eyes, I was so ashamed of what I had done. My coworker knew I was married, and yet he still exploited me in a moment of weakness, but I know I should be blaming myself for not keeping my distance.

It's been a week, and I can't bring myself to tell my husband. I watched a Cheikh on YouTube who advised not to tell something that Allah didn't uncover Himself and that I should conceal what Allah concealed. But I feel like he deserves to know the truth, especially now that we've agreed to start all over again, and we're thinking of having a baby together. What do you think? Should I tell him or keep it to myself? And please, don't be harsh on me I've already had my fair share of pain.",4,1759966474.0,algeria,21,0.75,False

1o1qslk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1o1qslk/28f_phl_the_swans_trail/,28F. PHL: The Swan‚Äôs Trail.,"ü¶¢ a glimpse of her. 

Hi again. I‚Äôm writing this softly.. just letting these words find whoever they‚Äôre meant for. 

~ I‚Äôve always been drawn to the quiet side of life, home, comfort and peace. I find joy in things like being with the people I care about and doing the little things that make life feel real and meaningful.

ü¶¢ what fills her days.

Teaching andnurturing. I teach from home and it‚Äôs become one of the sweetest callings in my life.. helping, guiding.. shaping young minds with patience.

Nature and moments. I enjoy spending time outdoors with family or friends or sometimes just by myself with a cup of coffee or even plain water in hand, watching the world slow down and my thoughts settle. 

Vintage soul. I have a deep love for vintage or antique pieces. Old buildings.. and if something draws my heart, I‚Äôll find myself visiting a museum again and again. 

Family and company. I value quality over quantity. 

ü¶¢ the heart behind her faith. 

My faith grew most in the quiet seasons, the ones that asked for patience, forgiveness and trust when nothing made sense. It‚Äôs shaped the way I love and move through life. Over time.. I realized that womanhood isn‚Äôt about being seen, it‚Äôs about how you bring calm where there used to be noise and warmth where there used to be walls. 

ü¶¢ who she is in words. 

Emotionally intuitive. I feel deeply but don‚Äôt let emotions control me. I try to lead with empathy and understanding.

Grounded and discerning. I‚Äôm not easily swayed by charm. I pay attention to consistency, integrity and peace.

Faithfully feminine. I‚Äôve learned that gentleness doesn‚Äôt mean weakness.. it‚Äôs knowing when to stand firm without losing grace.

Detail oriented. I am also someone who is straightforward when it comes to right and wrong. Emotionally sensitive. At times, I can be a bit of a perfectionist, but I try not to let it rule over me. 

Old soul at heart. Has fondness writing letters, old songs to vintage aesthetics, slow mornings, quiet prayers.

Honest and loyal. One of my love language is reliability.. showing up, following through and meaning what I say.

ü¶¢ a testimony of grace. 

I‚Äôve never been in a relationship (nbsb). At 26, I once thought I had found someone who could be ‚Äúthe one,‚Äù but God had a different plan. That season tested me, but it also became one of my most meaningful testimonies.

It taught me to discern words from actions, promises from presence, and charm from character. It showed me that rejection can be redirection and that God‚Äôs ‚Äúno‚Äù is sometimes His deepest protection. 

ü¶¢ what she believe about love. 

Love is sacred, not rushed. I don‚Äôt chase connection. I nurture it. 

Dating should be intentional, not experimental. I want to see how someone lives out their words, not just what they say. 

Faith and character first. I‚Äôm drawn to a man who leads with humility, serves with faith and values commitment.

Consistency > charm. Big words fade, actions last.

Boundaries are not walls. They‚Äôre protection for what‚Äôs precious.

ü¶¢ her purpose here. 

I didn‚Äôt really plan on joining again this subreddit. I just felt a quiet nudge one evening, like maybe I should open my heart a little again. I‚Äôm not searching out of loneliness, but out of hope. Hope that somewhere, someone out there also longs for the same kind of peace I do. 

I grew up seeing what love and commitment look like in ways. My father‚Äôs a farmer and my mother used to work as a government employee before becoming a full time housewife. Watching her make that shift taught me a lot about patience, and care and the kind of strength it takes to make a home. 

l've always dreamt of a home where love is a place of comfort. Where the scent of freshly baked bread lingers in the kitchen, little footprints can be found in garden, birds are chirping in the trees.. prayers whispered as naturally as breathing. 

I aspire to homeschool my future children when they are young, to be their first full time teacher. I want to teach them how to read, write, how to pray, and how to see God in everything. I want to raise my children who learn by exploring, asking questions and being close to nature. 

My purpose isn‚Äôt to rush love, but to stay open to it. A man who understands what it means to lead with kindness, protect with strength and love with patience. Someone who sees partnership as a shared calling.. not just romance, but purpose and devotion that it will blend naturally. 

Maybe that‚Äôs a lot to hope for. But I‚Äôve learned that the best things never need to be rushed hehe. So, here I am again.. just writing this from a place of peace, trusting that if it‚Äôs meant, it‚Äôll find its way in time (: 

ü¶¢ if you‚Äôre reaching out. 

Before you message, take a quiet pause. Ask yourself why. If it‚Äôs out of curiosity, that‚Äôs fine, but if it‚Äôs out of sincerity, that‚Äôs better. If your heart seeks something faith centered and genuine, I‚Äôll meet you with the same openness, care and gentleness. 

I‚Äôve come to realize that words are easy to say, but it‚Äôs the quiet follow through that reveals who someone really is.. hmm, someone who made promises in big, beautiful ways but when it came down to the ordinary days, a simple reply, keeping plans, showing up when it mattered.. they fell short. That experience taught me to look for consistency over charm. 

ü¶¢ as the words settle.  

You‚Äôll see a few softly blurred photos. https://imgur.com/a/N80xBpv I like keeping a little mystery in a world that shows too much, too soon. I‚Äôll share clearer facepic when trust and comfort will naturally grow.

For a little picture of me. I‚Äôm 163cm, with medium light brown skintone, dark brown eyes, black hair.. just a simple and typical Filipina look, nothing that.. striking. I‚Äôve learned to embrace the kind of beauty that comes from peace and contentment. And.. as a Christian woman, I dress modestly if that‚Äôs important to the reader. 

ü¶¢ until then.

Right people will always find their way to each other in God‚Äôs time. I‚Äôm simply walking forward with faith and openness to the story He‚Äôs still writing in life.

I know online spaces can be overwhelming, but I realized that sometimes God uses unexpected places to connect people. I‚Äôm not in a rush, but I‚Äôd like to open the door for meaningful conversations and see where faith and time might lead.

I just finished mine, completely solo, in 3 days, for $1,500 total and I thought it might be useful to share how.

**Quick result**  
My campaign launched a week ago and it‚Äôs already 185% funded.  
Here‚Äôs what I think worked best for me:

**Why I kept it lean**  
The campaign itself isn‚Äôt huge, so dropping $5K+ on a video didn‚Äôt make sense. I wanted something polished enough to build trust with backers but light enough on the wallet to keep funds focused on production.

**My gear setup**  
Rented DSLR + 2 lenses (variety for wide + tight shots)  
Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal It smoothed out shots and even let me pre-program camera moves so I could fake a second cameraman while being in front of the camera myself.

**Rentals + accessories ($900)**  
Music license + motion graphics pack: $250  
Editing software subscription (Premiere Pro + After Effects): $150  
Misc (props, delivery fees, etc.): $200  
Food/coffee for 3 straight days of shooting: priceless

**Planning & filming**  
Scripted in a 2-column doc (voiceover vs visuals) this saved me rental days.  
90% was filmed in my condo. Shallow depth of field made boring rooms look cinematic.  
Hohem‚Äôs motion path features made it look like a crew was operating the camera when it was just me.

**Editing & polish**  
Background track set the pace (royalty-free).  
Learned quick tricks from YouTube tutorials (motion tracking titles, color correction).  
Editing took another 2 days, but I kept costs low by doing it all myself.

**Why I think this worked**  
The end result isn‚Äôt Hollywood, but it looks professional enough for Kickstarter standards and it gave me the confidence to launch without burning cash before the campaign even started. Most production houses quoted me $3,000‚Äì$7,000 for a similar video. By going DIY, I kept it at $1,500. For me, that‚Äôs what minimum viable production looks like.

TL;DR: Shot my Kickstarter video solo in 3 days for $1,500. Campaign is already 185% funded.

* Lived in an RV parked in the driveway of my rental property. Gave my tenant $100 off rent to let me stay there. I taped my debts to the ceiling for motivation. It was humbling and cold, but it got results.
* I took everyone‚Äôs leftovers at restaurants when eating out with friends and family. I would ‚Äúforget‚Äù my wallet. Sometimes I would crash my friends‚Äô vacations and sleep on the hotel room floor to save on travel.
* Used dollar-store solar lights indoors, washed dishes at work, reused cracker boxes as paper towels for bacon grease.
* My ex added all the kids to his YMCA pass for a few years. So I bathed my kids at the YMCA every night to save on utilities. I would volunteer to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù after parties just to get free leftovers.
* I volunteered at a thrift store. The staff would set aside the best finds, then I flipped them on Poshmark.
* Sold my car and bought cargo bikes. Transportation costs dropped to 3% of our budget.
* We would pretend to have ‚Äúplans‚Äù when invited to get-togethers at restaurants, and either show up early just for drinks, or at the end just for dessert/coffee. We paid for Christmas with TD promo gift cards we got during a promotional week. Showed up at opening every day to be one of the first 10 transactions to get the gift cards.¬†
* I bought dirty work clothes from a Cintas laundry guy for $5, washed and resold them to tradies for $10.
* Unplugged my fridge for winter and kept food on the balcony.
* RSVP‚Äôd to corporate events in my area for free catered meals. I‚Äôd pretend to be a junior analyst or a consultant. I even carried a clipboard and used a fake name.¬†
* Joined a gym for a free trial, showered there daily, never worked out.
* I bought used clothing bundles on Facebook for my kids, then resold them at the same price when they grew out of them. I did have to be careful to keep them in good shape though.¬†
* I used to buy used, broken items and return them to manufacturers with lifetime guarantees for full refunds. Only certain brands do this, though, like Cutco, Le Crueset. So you need to do your research first.¬†
* My father-in-law stole toilet paper from the YMCA twice a day. He had a laundry basket full of it.
* We saved shower water to flush the toilet.
* Save wild apples and put them in a cooler to eat over winter.¬†

I'm curious to hear what you think.

So while we aren‚Äôt legally married, we‚Äôve together long enough that it‚Äôs very much like a marriage. We moved out of our home state 5 years ago and bought a house 4 years ago. 

Last year, 2024, we rarely did anything that was outside of the house. If we did anything, I was the one that organized it and constantly remind him of the activity/ event. He works from home, never leaves the house, doesn‚Äôt have any friends here, plays video games all day. So there is nothing for him to keep track of, but always pulls the ‚ÄúI forgot‚Äù card. So in December, I told him that I wanted us to do one thing a month outside of the house. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be the whole day, just a couple of hours. We could her breakfast, go for a walk, get a coffee, see a movie, go to a museum, walk along the river, whatever. It‚Äôs now October 2025 and we haven‚Äôt done anything. 

I made a new friend and she does a lot of Meetups and got me into it, I‚Äôve been going to various events for the last few months. Every time there is an event, I ask him if he wave to go and he always says no. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt interest me‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go‚Äù ‚Äúhave fun with your friends ‚Äú etc. I send him events and ask if he‚Äôs interested in any of them, he says no. I ask him what he wants to do and he just says nothing interests him. Then goes and plays video games for hours. 

Several months ago we had a talk and he wanted me to be more physically affectionate (cuddling, hugs, kiss), which I‚Äôm not (except with my cats). So I tried to be more mindful and cuddly. He‚Äôd be lying on the bed and I‚Äôd go lay next to him. He wouldn‚Äôt wrap his arm around me to hold me, just kind leave his arm behind me. We‚Äôd be sitting in the couch, he‚Äôd just drape his arm over my shoulder. I‚Äôd hug him, he‚Äôd put his hands on my hips and then pat me indicating he wanted me to let go. He‚Äôd only kiss me, if I initiated it and it would be a quick peck. Meanwhile, I told him that I wanted him to do things with me; he didn‚Äôt. So while I was putting in more effort, he wasn‚Äôt do anything. So I stopped trying. It‚Äôs not something that comes naturally to me and really awkward when the other person isn‚Äôt actually reciprocating. 

One day I had the realization that I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time he said he lived with me, without me saying it first. So I stopped to if I was wrong, I wasn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt remember the last time he said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and I don‚Äôt remember when the last time I said it. He doesn‚Äôt touch me, he doesn‚Äôt really talk to me; except about a show we‚Äôre watching, friends from home, or work. He doesn‚Äôt call me ‚Äúbaby‚Äù anymore, either he doesn‚Äôt refer to me as anything and just repeats himself if I didn‚Äôt hear him or when I call him after work he says ‚Äúhey you‚Äù 

We work the same hours, but I work in an office and he works from home. We work full time. So we only have one car, which doesn‚Äôt help the whole ‚Äúhe never leaves the house thing‚Äù, but he doesn‚Äôt make an effort at all to leave the house. The last time I got the house to myself was months ago and it was for 45 minutes, when he got his haircut. 

Back to the calling thing, I call him everyday after work. We have a chat about our day and then I drive home and he takes a shower. If I don‚Äôt call him, he doesn‚Äôt call me. Like I said, I do this everyday. So he and his friends were going to get back into playing D&D together online and it would be immediately after work basically. I would call him, he‚Äôd ignore me. When I got home he‚Äôd say he was ‚Äúbusy‚Äù playing a game. 

One day, this was months ago, I called him and he ignored me. On the way home, I decided last minute that I was going to go to Target. I noticed the car behind me also got into the same lane. Then he made the turn, sane turn again, and followed me around the parking lot. There was zero doubt, that car was following me around. I called him again, but again didn‚Äôt answer. By the time I made it other other is the parking lot, the car took off, but I was going to drive to the police station if he followed me again to the main road and I had 911 on my phone. I drove in the complete opposite direction that I saw the car go in and drove around for a while, before making my way home. I got home an hour later than I normally do. I was really upset about the whole situation and that he didn‚Äôt answer his phone. Again he told me that bullshit ‚ÄúI was busy‚Äù when I demanded to know why he didn‚Äôt answer. 

We only watch tv or movies together and as soon as it‚Äôs over, he goes upstairs and play video games. He doesn‚Äôt do anything around the house, I have to tell him to do things or physically bring him things to do. For example, I do laundry everyday and I will credit him, he switches it, but he just piles the clothes in the basket. So I have bring him the basket and tell him to find the clothes. Now his thing is, he won‚Äôt fold them, unless I‚Äôm folding them üò§ one day he had the audacity to tell me that laundry is the only chore I keep with. He‚Äôs not exactly Cinderella breaking his back in his hands and knees scrubbing the flood. Ohhh!! That‚Äôs another thing! He gave himself a nickname if I ask him to do more than four things in a row. Now, I do admit that I‚Äôm not a great homemaker and keeping up with everything in the house is overwhelming. It‚Äôs very cluttered and I can‚Äôt handle it by myself. 

I know I‚Äôve been ragging on him, but he does do some really sweet things. He packs my lunch for me everyday, he gives me back scratches at night before bed, he makes me tea every morning. He pays the bills and he‚Äôs the one that handled the house buying process. It‚Äôs his car that we share (though I‚Äôm the one that mainly drives it and maintains it). He‚Äôs allergic to cats and we have two. I know that‚Äôs part of the reason he stays in the office so much. 

Idk what to do üòî

Attention span -20 unless there are no distractions. SOS.,"I have an 8 month old Catahoula/Coonhound mix. She's smart, sassy, stubborn, and strong as heck. I've posted here before about her puppy classes and different things. Everything turned out alright. This time, though, she is keeping me ON MY TOES. 

We just started ""advanced"" obedience classes a couple weeks ago. From beginner and intermediate till now feels like 0-100. Our training is force free. ""Here's the guidelines for Canine Good Citizen. Here's what we expect by now. Here's the one thing you're learning this week. Oh, by the way, only give them kibbke this week, as we'll be weaning off of treats."" Etc etc...

A.) Idk if we can wean off of treats that fast.
B.) She gets most, if not all, of the commands quickly. She loves practicing. HOWEVER, we have now entered her rebellious teenage phase. Sometimes it seems like she shuts her ears off.
C.) She still gets distracted SO EASILY. She wants to play with and greet everyone. Our class is in the middle of the day on the weekend. SO MANY people. SO MANY dogs. Most of them with no boundaries or respect to the fact that we are actively training. I have her in a heel or down stay, praying to all of the otherworldly beings that I can keep on keeping her attention. Here comes someone to stand at the end of the aisle to watch us with their dog barking, or someone letting their kids run up to us. Luckily, she's friendly. Some of our other classmates, not so much (which weirdly love her?). Unluckily, she still gets WAY too excited, and abandons what we were doing. I know that that can be good practice for distractions, but holy cow.
D.) We got her right after that ""socialization window"" was closed. I plan to talk to our trainer about it, but how do I train her to focus and calm down, when her threshold in class and public places is so small? It's definitely gotten better, but at the same time, the business and rotation of dogs in the class the past couple of weeks has really had her way too amped up to learn unless it's during the portions we break off and practice on our own. 

Her ""leave it"" is better. We've abandoned her fancy no slip harness, and went back to leash/collar (martingale) pressure this week, so I can lead her attention back to me. When we are on walks, she has learned to sit when people pass or walk towards us, as I would rather have her watchful and calm than watchful and pulling me down the road. I still use leave it and walk the other way on occasion as well, as I don't want her to think she can't watch or interact with other people and dogs. She has also found her voice even more, and will (loudly) bark at others just to get attention and play. I've been trying to redirect her, walk away, or use leave it when she does this. One of the only things that helps is high value treats, which leads us back to point B. 

About to go walk around Home Depot, or sit outside a coffee shop. Idk how to tell her not everyone wants her all up in their business. Idk how to train her while also leaving every new situation over and over again because she's a hyperfriendly powerhouse. 

I love her. So much. I'm so proud of her. She impresses me daily... But I swear, she's so smart, that she knows how to misbehave and get under my skin exactly when I'm trying to teach her to do the opposite ü§£

Tl:dr... My dog has hit her teenage phase. She has plenty of exercise and enrichment. She is being menace in her new advanced class. Barking, crying, etc. She just wants to meet everyone, see everything, and play to her hearts desire.... While also weaning off of treats for training... üôÉ

P.s. this is also the same dog who will calmly sit and watch traffic, or play go find it for hours. ",3,1759965596.0,puppy101,4,1.0,False

by Preston Dennett

All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It‚Äôs a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it‚Äôs not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

But a real one, who can be there for you when you need them. Not just once a month on lunch, not just generic advice, someone who has done it, successful and eager to share?

This is one of the biggest differentiatior for being successful. You do not have to try yourself, you can take the path that is proven and get advice on your way to end line. Most corporate CEOs, successful actors, athletes all have a mentor they can talk to and learn the secrets.

It is a beatuiful thing because they can open up many doors for you, while I decided I wanted to work in high finance after school, my mentor directly connected me with M&A boutique owners and directors from big investment banks that I could talk to and learn from. It would be much harder to learn from them with reaching on LinkedIn, asking coffee chat. This is just a simple case but I saw some mentors really taught the business specifics and raised the next leaders for their retirement.

But, it is so hard to find someone who is willing to put in the work for you, who can actually help you without thinking twice about jealousy so your mentor should be more successful than you at first and they should already accomplish your path or have no interest having them. Once you find it, automatic upgrade will happen on your life.

Bad thing is, you have to earn their trust and you have to prove yourself that you are worthy because you may not act like yourself sometimes when you are desperate for being likeable and get their approval. And even if you do, no one will be 7/24 available for you.

That's why, outside of my mentors, I also wanted someone who can be by my side no matter what, 24/7 and understand what I was going through so I am using Ascend AI - Accountability Coach that allows you to create your own future self, who actually accomplished your goals and you are getting mentorship to be like him/her. It is a fun and engaging idea for me, been trying for one week and I will report back once I achieve some of my goals to become my future self from 10 years later.

1o1q98d,https://www.reddit.com/r/metalworking/comments/1o1q98d/options_process_for_chemical_etchingblackening/,Options & process for chemical etching/blackening mild steel?,"Hi there, I'm making a pendant for a friend out of 1/4"" hot-rolled mild 'black' steel ([this stock)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9VRXKQZ) with an unknown coating. I had the idea to use some form of chemical etching to get the color darker, in particular coffee etching but I've struggled to find examples of how it turns out on plain steel since so many of the results are damascus knife blades.

I'm fine with some color variation and visible texture, I'd just like to go darker than it already is. It's my understanding that I'd want to sand down to a fairly high polish (as in upwards of 600 grit) and then it'll hold something like instant coffee etching better. I know you can do ferric chloride but I don't have anywhere near me to pick that up, and I'm entirely unfamiliar with blueing + don't really have a setup that would allow for heating up a piece to quench in oil.

What I'm not sure of is what coating this stuff already has on it, and if sanding and then etching would interact poorly with that? I'm already going to have to do some filing and sanding to clean up rough edges after I cut the piece. In general I'd just like to know what sort of end results I can reasonably achieve.

This happened a couple months back, but I saw a skit online that was scarily similar to what actually happened to me IRL.

For context, I‚Äôm a divorce attorney. Been practicing for about 8 years now, mostly family law stuff. Generally pretty routine work - people want to untangle their lives, I help them do it legally, everyone moves on.

Let‚Äôs flash back to last March‚Ä¶

I took on what seemed like a straightforward dissolution case. Client I‚Äôll call Dave - nice enough guy, been separated from his wife for over a year, just wanted to make it official. Nothing complicated, decent retainer, figured we‚Äôd have it wrapped up in a few months. Dave seemed reasonable, not one of those vindictive types trying to burn everything down out of spite.

Around the same time, I‚Äôd been seeing this woman Sarah for a couple months. Met her at a coffee shop near my office, really hit it off. She mentioned going through a divorce but I didn‚Äôt pry - not exactly first date conversation, you know? She had a different last name from what was in my client files, so when I ran my conflict checks, nothing flagged.

Everything was going great with Sarah. Really great, actually. We were taking things slow but it was heading in a good direction‚Ä¶

Until we scheduled the first four-way settlement meeting.

I walk into the conference room with Dave, chatting about keeping things amicable, and there‚Äôs Sarah sitting across the table with her attorney.

I literally just stopped mid-sentence. My briefcase slipped right out of my hands and hit the floor with this loud thud. Sarah went completely white. Dave looked back and forth between us for what felt like an eternity, and I could see the exact moment it clicked for him.

‚ÄúAre you fucking serious right now?‚Äù he says. Not shouting, but definitely not pleased.

Sarah started tearing up. Her lawyer looked like he wanted to crawl under the table. I‚Äôm standing there feeling like the biggest moron in legal history.

Had to immediately excuse myself with Dave. Guy was understandably pissed. Started grilling me - how long had this been going on, did I know who she was, was this some kind of setup to screw him over. I‚Äôm trying to explain that I‚Äôd been dating his wife for a couple months without having any clue who she was. He didn‚Äôt buy it at first.

‚ÄúWhat kind of lawyer doesn‚Äôt ask basic questions?‚Äù he keeps saying. Had to pull out my intake notes to prove the name thing, show him how the conflict check works, basically convince an angry client that I‚Äôm incompetent rather than malicious.

Took about twenty minutes before he finally believed it was just spectacularly bad luck. Even then he‚Äôs shaking his head, muttering about how fucked up this whole situation is.

I explained I‚Äôd have to withdraw from his case and help him find new counsel. There‚Äôs no getting around it - I‚Äôve got a personal relationship with the opposing party, which makes it impossible for me to represent him properly.

By the end he‚Äôd calmed down enough to say ‚ÄúThis is the weirdest goddamn thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me.‚Äù Still wasn‚Äôt happy about starting over with a new lawyer, but he understood why it had to happen.

The paperwork was a nightmare. Had to file a motion to withdraw since we were already in litigation, transfer all his files, deal with refunding unused fees. Sarah and I didn‚Äôt speak for two weeks after that meeting - we were both mortified. Her attorney spent forever trying to convince himself this wasn‚Äôt some elaborate scheme.

Even though nobody intended for this to happen, it was still my screwup. Should have had better procedures to catch conflicts like this. Doesn‚Äôt matter that it was an accident - you mess up the conflict check, you deal with the consequences.

Dave texted me a few weeks later, but it wasn‚Äôt friendly. More like ‚Äúhope you realize this completely fucked up my timeline.‚Äù Can‚Äôt say I blame him.

And just to add insult to injury, my malpractice insurance premium went up when I had to report the conflict.

**TL;DR: Been dating a woman for months, then unknowingly took her husband‚Äôs divorce case. Found out during our first settlement meeting when we all ended up in the same room. Had to withdraw from representation, everyone was pissed, professional disaster all around.**

1o1q5tw,https://i.redd.it/fi0fuzwcyytf1.jpeg,"Breaking down the episode ‚ÄúWill the Real Martian Please Stand Up?‚Äù - 8 categories, 1 final score","S2, Ep 28: ‚ÄúWill the Real Martian Please Stand Up?‚Äù
(In the midst of a snowy night, a cafe full of strangers plays host to a mystery)
-
-
-
1Ô∏è‚É£ Storyline:

Before The Thing, before Hateful Eight, and perhaps taking inspiration from ‚ÄúThree Little Indians‚Äù/And Then There Were None, this is one of the most delightful stories in the whole TZ run. There are other episodes with more plot arc and higher stakes, but this is so much darn fun! 

Score: 10/10 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

2Ô∏è‚É£ Atmosphere:

No other Twilight Zone makes me want to cozy up with a hot coffee and warm blanket like ‚ÄúThe Real Martian‚Äù. The opening sequence of the troopers investigating the crash site, their boots crunching on the snow as they meander through the woods to the little cafe, *ooh!* the atmosphere is incredible. I absolutely ADORE ‚Äústrangers trapped in a cabin‚Äù type thrillers, so it‚Äôs no surprise this is perhaps my favorite Twilight Zone, and the Hateful Eight is one of my favorite Tarantino films. I‚Äôll go into this more, in Category 4. 

Score: 10/10

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

3Ô∏è‚É£ Existential Terror: 

The final sequence certainly brings a large element of theoretical terror, wondering for the fate of the human race, but it‚Äôs not really played for fright. The whole episode is more of a mysterious curiosity than anything horrific. 

Score: 3/10

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

4Ô∏è‚É£ Creepiness:

‚ÄúWill the real Martian please stand up‚Äù is unique in that it‚Äôs not one of the TZs that goes for horror or thriller yet it has fantastic spookiness throughout. The restless unease that grows all through the narrative, is like a sleeping monster in the corner - mostly in the background, often very subtle, but omnipresent and always staring the viewer in the face. Though it doesn‚Äôt go for the same impact as ‚ÄúMaple Street‚Äù, the same idea of quickly jumping to harsh accusations of our fellow man is manifest here. We also get a couple creepy ‚Äújumpscare-lite‚Äù moments, with the jukebox and the sugar. And finally, that scene of the old man walking briskly into the diner near the end, seemingly unperturbed by recent events, always strikes me as such a subtle sign of inhuman malevolence. 

Score: 7/10

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

5Ô∏è‚É£ Lesson:

There‚Äôs almost no lesson here, other than a watered-down version of what I discussed in the previous category - like ‚ÄúMaple Street‚Äù, how quickly will we jump down our neighbor‚Äôs throat in order to protect our own reputation?

Score: 3/10

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

6Ô∏è‚É£ World-Building:

We don‚Äôt get much backstory at all, but there‚Äôs a reason for that so I won‚Äôt dock this category too much. Within the confines of the brief evening we get to spend with this stranded bus, the policemen, and the diner manager - the world building is actually very good. The bridge being out, the earlier investigation of what might be a crash scene, the explanation of why the bus driver doesn‚Äôt recall everyone - it‚Äôs all done perfectly here and we get a beautifully holistic story in only 25 minutes. 

Score: 8/10

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

7Ô∏è‚É£ Acting:

I don‚Äôt know if anyone‚Äôs acting blows me away, but I am a big fan of both William Kendis & Jean Willis in this episode, as the driver and the dancer respectively. They both come off very authentically. Barney Phillips as the cafe owner is a joy, and I laugh out loud every time Jack Elam opens his mouth (one of the only times the Twilight Zone tries for comedy and actually is hilarious) as the crazy old man. The rest of the cast is fine, with an underwhelming performance by the young couple as perhaps the only flaw. 

Score: 7/10

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

8Ô∏è‚É£ The Human Condition:

I‚Äôve already discussed the paranoia and jumping to conclusions, but those things certainly are an unfortunate feature - not a bug - of human beings, especially when in a state of uncertainty and fear. We also get little glimpses in this episode of different types of people from very diverse backgrounds, and what motivates them and what irks them, is different for each one. I love that. It‚Äôs like an airplane terminal: you‚Äôll commonly see a young mom seated next to a businessman seated across from a foreign traveler who‚Äôs standing next to a soldier seated next to a sales rep who‚Äôs across from a grizzled old man about to fly for the first time who‚Äôs sitting next to a family with 3 kids heading home from vacation.  

Score: 7/10

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

‚úÖ Total Score:
 55

This is certainly in the running for my favorite Twilight Zone. It‚Äôs almost certainly the most rewatchable one, for me personally. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best, or even one of the top 10 best. But it‚Äôs so much fun to watch, such a cool little mystery and a world that I want to soak in for as many minutes as the episode allows.

1o1q2ym,https://i.redd.it/akn228uixytf1.jpeg,Suspected IVDD,"This will be long. Sorry. I'm not ok.

My 12.5 year old Bernese/lab cross was just diagnosed with suspected IVDD through x-ray. I am following up with a neurologist but want to be informed.

He's a very very active boy. I've had him since he was a puppy and our lives are spent hiking and paddleboarding. He loves to jump and run and play. He certainly doesn't go easy and my motto so far has been ""use it or lose it"". His mobility and activity levels are excellent for an adult dog, let alone a senior dog. 

We were hiking off-leash in the woods as we do every day and as he was running especially quickly after a squirrel he took a corner and his back legs went out from underneath him and his left leg stayed under him and wasn't working. At no point did he yelp or indicate he was in any pain. He's normally pretty vocal about discomfort. I immediately scooped him up and started carrying him out, having to put him down periodically to rest as it was a long hike out and he's not small (I'm a woman). The first two times I put him down he was in the same condition but the third time he stood up and started walking. I walked him very slowly back to my large SUV and when I opened the trunk he jumped right in (I was of course planning to lift him up). I took him to the emergency vet and they couldn't find anything wrong other than a slight limp/weakness in his back left leg- but said his mobility and strength etc overall was still excellent for his age. 

I took him to ""his"" vet yesterday and she said he seemed tender in one area of his spine so we did x-rays. She said the results show likely IVDD and recommended metacam as an anti-inflammatory. 

I haven't been restricting his activity at all because he hasn't been acting like he's in any pain. He's been chasing squirrels, jumping on the bed/couch and begging for his daily hikes. 

So I guess what I'm looking for is support and commiseration but also advice. He's old and his happiness and comfort really matter to me. I remember when my grandma was in the later stages of cancer the things that she missed the most were being able to do the simple things. She missed being able to go out for coffee or take a walk through her garden. It's important to me that my boy doesn't just live, but enjoys his life- but I realize it may end up being a balancing act, I'm just not sure what to balance. 

I've always known I'll lose him one day, but he's been the love of life for over a decade. It's just me and him and my entire life is structured around him. The worry and stress is hard to handle. 

Money isn't an issue, I'd do anything for him. I just want to make decisions that prioritize his comfort and happiness. He doesn't handle anaesthesia well (I almost lost him during a dental cleaning) so I'm not even sure what I will be able to do as far as tests and treatments. 

For now he's going on metacam to control any inflammation and help with pain. He's not showing any signs of pain but my vet says he is likely experiencing some. ",6,1759964406.0,IVDD_SupportGroup,3,1.0,False
