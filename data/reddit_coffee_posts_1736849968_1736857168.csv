An app to make meaningful friendships in a world where adult connections can feel harder than ever to build!? 

My recent experience with Bumble BFF has actually left me feeling emotionally vulnerable, deflated, questioning my judgment, and picking up the pieces to now heal from a friendship that turned out to be toxic. 

I’m here to share my experience and perspective to perhaps remind others to be careful, and also because it’s therapeutic for me to open up and share this in an anonymous space. 

Settle in for my novella (lol).. 

After countless matches that fizzled out, ghosted messages, and flakes (which I know many here have commonly experienced), I finally met Cassie* (not her real name). She was bubbly, warm, and we clicked instantly! As a neurodivergent woman, I often feel misunderstood or out of place in social settings, but with Cassie, the conversation flowed easily. I felt seen, understood, and genuinely excited about this budding friendship.

Over the next few months, we met up several times for coffee, fitness classes, and even brunches. Things felt easy—until subtle red flags began surfacing. Cassie would cancel plans last minute or ask to reschedule, only to drop them altogether. She rarely apologised or even acknowledged how her flakiness inconvenienced me, instead texting later as if nothing had even happened. At first, I brushed it off. Life is exhausting, and I get it. But the pattern kept repeating, and I realised I should have named it with her sooner. Anyhow, no big deal.. 

The cracks began to be more obvious when I had invited Cassie to a fun (rather pricey) event and offered her my spare ticket. She didn’t offer to pay me back the cost of the ticket, but I didn’t mind or expect her to so that was fine. She accepted enthusiastically, and we confirmed everything the night before. 

The day of the event, I texted her to let her know I’d arrived a little early, and she texted back “OMG! I thought it was tomorrow!” My heart sank, and an obvious pattern was emerging.

I encouraged her to come, and she did, albeit late, with a brief apology. While the event was fun, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. 

THEN most recently- all alarm bells went off when we planned to attend a community hike weeks later, and she deliberately stood me up 😔

The night before, I sent a text to confirm. She didn’t reply, but given her history, I assumed she’d still show up. I got to the meeting spot early, texted her multiple times, and waited. And waited. After 30 minutes of standing alone, feeling embarrassed (I didn’t know anyone else there) and hurt, I left. 

On my drive home, Cassie texted to say she wasn’t coming because she’d assumed I wasn’t interested in our plans, so had made other plans. I started to cry. It turns out, she had based this decision on a completely unrelated incident where I’d taken two days to reply to a text earlier that week.

Her explanation floored me. Cassie admitted that my past delays in replying to her texts in general had “hurt” her and so she’d started intentionally delaying her reply times to mirror mine!? She also implied that I’d fallen short of her expectations in a solid friendship. 

Suddenly, it occurred to me that I had unknowingly been strung along in a series of unspoken “tests” to see how much I cared about the friendship. It also dawned on me that her previous cancellations and forgetfulness weren’t just flakiness or forgetfulness, they were deliberate tests designed to “measure my commitment”!! 

This revelation hit me like a ton of bricks. It explained so much: her vagueness about past friendships, the way she seemed to hold onto perceived slights, and her lack of accountability for how her actions affected me.

Being on the receiving end of these “tests” has actually now really messed with my head and bought up painful childhood memories. I’ve spent years in therapy working to create relationships that feel safe and supportive, yet here I am, questioning myself again because of someone else’s unresolved issues.

I’ve communicated to Cassie how this has made me feel while also acknowledging that perhaps her actions have come from a place of genuine past trauma/pain. She’s not apologised or acknowledged her actions or how they’ve impacted me at all. Needless to say, I’ve cut all contact with her. 

Unfortunately, my experience with Bumble BFF has left an extremely sour taste and I will not be back on it. My trust is shattered- but I don’t want to live that way. 

The app is kinda dangerous for anyone who may be emotionally vulnerable. It creates this weird “forced” dynamic, where you’re actively searching for reasons to invest in a friendship, often overlooking early red flags. Unlike organic friendships that develop naturally over time, Bumble BFF connections can feel rushed and artificial, making it harder to notice when something isn’t quite right.

While I’m now doing some work in therapy to heal from this experience, it won’t be anything I forget anytime soon. It’s been a reminder to trust in my instincts- if something feels off, it probably is. Uphold my boundaries and values, and to not let anyone make me feel guilty for expecting the basic decency of respect and emotional safety in a friendship.",1,1736857081.0,bumblebff,0,1.0,False
1i14rvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1i14rvb/struggling_with_recurring_rectal_bleeding/,Struggling with Recurring Rectal Bleeding,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share something that’s been weighing on me and maybe get some advice or support.

Back in April 2023, I noticed blood in my stool for the first time. It really freaked me out, so I went to see a proctologist right away. They told me it was just hemorrhoids.

Since then, the bleeding hasn’t completely gone away. It happens about 3-4 times a month. I went back to the proctologist three more times, but every time they reassured me that it was nothing serious—just hemorrhoids.

In February 2024, I decided to get a colonoscopy to rule out anything more serious. Thankfully, everything came back clear except for Grade 1-2 hemorrhoids.

During the summer of 2024, I actually had about two months without any bleeding, which gave me some hope. Overall, I bled about 10 times in 2024, which was less frequent than in 2023.

Unfortunately, 2025 hasn’t started well for me. I’ve already had 7 days this year with bright red blood on the stool and toilet paper. It’s really discouraging. I’ve also noticed that coffee seems to make things worse, but cutting it out entirely has been tough.

I feel my mood slipping again because of all this. My next doctor’s appointment isn’t for another two months, and even though I’ve been told multiple times that it’s “just hemorrhoids,” I can’t shake the fear that it could be something more serious.

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for listening.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has any tips, I’d really appreciate it.",1,1736857037.0,hemorrhoid,0,1.0,False

Got married at 19 and 21. Had a pretty up and down marriage. We have 3 kids. We both did really bad things in our marriage. He’s always been very controlling to the shows I watch, how much I talk to my family. My sister used to do only fans and corn. He would partake and watch. He has always had a problem with a sex addiction corn addiction. I was pregnant with our second child. He wanted to tie me up for fun he ended forcing a n a l when I was screaming to stop. I never got over it. He uses sex as a weapon the only way he wants love is through sex. He would make me wear short skirts or dresses so he could watch people upskirt me. If I said no he was mean and would put me down. I have a problem with lying because even if I was honest he would twist it and would be so angry at me. But if he did something like jerk off in front of our window on a busy street wanting woman to see I was in the wrong. He recently started taking steroids and he became violent, just yelling. 2 weeks ago he got mad at me. Be through my laptop, broke 2 glass bowls got physical with me. Then I was sleeping and I woke up to him jerking me off. He condo says I don’t love him but I don’t have sex with him. He says I’m the reason he has a corn addiction. It’s not all him. I’m in the wrong too I’ve don’t things that aren’t okay. I cheated because I was so unhappy which I know is completely wrong. I was very young and it wasn’t okay. I don’t know how to talk to him because there is no talking to him. He can never just accept it let it go and move on. He gets so emotional like beyond when it’s something minor then after 2 hours of talking he’ll bring it up again. Then we talk again then after a day or 2 he wants to talk about it again. It’s so exhausting and I have been unhappy for a long time but never wanted to hurt my kids. Just yesterday I went to the coffee shop to get a coffee and he the first thing he says is was a dude helping you. He questions and controls everything I do or say. If I don’t hold his arm at the grocery store boom I’m in trouble I’m a terrible wife. I’m just so scared to be a single mom. I haven’t worked in 12 years I never went to college I have no idea what I’m gonna do. I’m emotionally ruined. I never want to have sex again because it’s a chore. He would also show girls his friends videos of us having sex he would show them videos of himself he said he showed his step sis his penis. He thinks sex makes it better. Even if I’m tired of having kids all day cooking cleaning after school activities and doing night time routine and if I don’t have sex with him in the bad one then he treats me horribly. I have no social media I’m not allowed to watch shows like housewives I’m not allowed to wear certain clothes anymore. I recently lost 40 pounds and he tells me how unattractive I am but still wants sex. I know if I read this I would say it’s a good thing I’m just so scared. I feel in my marriage I have to always thing of him in the back of my head I have always think before I do what I say what I do if I make small talk with the cashier he gets so mad at me. I’ve lied throughout our marriage because he was mean when I lied and he was mean when I told the truth there was no win win either way it was always my past that got brought up never his. And I’m tired I want to live myself again I have no confidence I’m so broken and sad and I know this isn’t how a marriage should be. Just help. Don’t shame me I already have enough.

I’m from England and assume it’s from the UK - but I don’t know! 

Is it a water / wine / coffee jug?
The markings on the bottom show stamps of various sorts. And some scratched numbers - maybe from servicing or dealing?

If anyone can help me identify its name... and its material make up, manufacturer and country of origin id be very grateful!

Back and forth we looked and smiled at each other, but nothing serious. We didn't even talk although we had plenty of chances. We didn't take them because we are stupid, socially awkward. Next problem is, we are both not very emotional – I'm autistic and he shows some symptoms as well. I don't have problems interpreting signals (at least I'm not better than most neurotypicals) but sending them is an issue for me. So I have seemed distant at occasions where I didn't want it.
Anyway. The signals never really stopped (but for one embarrassing situation I put myself in) and he even came up to me the last time we saw each other with a big grin to talk to me. He got interrupted so it didn't go anywhere.
Although we never really stopped to express at least nonverbally that ""there is something"" I can feel he is getting tired of it and I do as well.

I really think I've trapped myself here though. I can't think of anything different than him and a possible future with this guy for MONTHS now. We have almost no connection and didn't even talk! It's frustrating, it hurts, especially because of the load of uncertainty around it.
I thought about just letting everything pass, since we won't see each other that much in the future, but that's obviously easier said than done.
Since we have professional relationship with each other (don't worry, no power-dynamics or anything) I just asked him professionally for a meeting via E-Mail. Just to strike up a conversation, maybe destruct my uber-elevated picture of him, maybe to develop something out of it if he still likes me or can see us having a coffee some time. If not, it was just a professional meeting after all (although I'm not quite sure what I could ask him to not make it weird).
I don't want to creep him out with this and I also don't want to waste his time if I misinterpreted his behaviour in the past.
A rejection would hurt but this state our ""relationship"" is in is AWFUL. We'll see if it will work out this way.",1,1736856736.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1i14ogq,https://www.reddit.com/r/firsttimemom/comments/1i14ogq/feeling_lonely_in_a_different_city/,Feeling lonely in a different city ,"Wondering if anyone had advice regarding this. 

I am from quite a large capital city and before getting married I loved living there - my friends and family are there and I was quite a spoilt child (I’m 28 lol) so living with family was great. 

My husband was worked in a different city, smaller city. He’s always loved the “second city” feel and finds where I’m from too much. Overcrowded, smelly, polluted, etc. 

We moved to a different city, similar to where he worked but in the middle so I was close to my family - so we’re midway between his work and my family. 

Now we have a baby. Sometimes when I need extra support we go back to my city and stay with my parents, the longest we’ve stayed is a month. Whenever we go, I love it. I love being looked after, my baby gets attention and interaction and she always seems happy and develops new skills since she’s constantly being stimulated. 

My husband obviously hates it though, he copes for us obviously but he hates being in a house that’s not his, in a city he dislikes. 

Obviously, if I could, I would move back to my home city, and if it were up to him, we’d never move there. In this midway city, I feel quite lonely. I feel like I constantly need to stimulate my baby, like I don’t really have any support, like I can’t actually get anything done because I’m always holding her. I don’t have any level of a social life here. I find the city itself quite dull and ugly, nothing like the capital I came from. I know, I have “capital mind”, where you see your city as the best. 

Every time we discuss where we’ll live, we end up arguing or one of us ends up sad. We just have polar opposite opinions, I love a bustling loud noisy city where my friends and family are and he wants a quiet green not polluted place with no one around. 

I’m not sure what to do? Obviously it’s not just the city I miss, it’s having my parents around to hold my baby while I make a coffee or play with her while I go out for a walk. She seems so much happier during the day when there are people around too. I’m worried she won’t be as social if it’s just us three.

I don’t know how this is possible but I keep finding more boxes of her papers.  So I spent most of the day going through boxes of her stuff which just makes me sad.  I plow on so I can be finished with it.  So my office can look clean.  So I don’t have to do it in the future.  I feel like if I can get through all the boxes of stuff, I will have less sad days because when I go through her stuff, I’m sad.  I’m sad anyway so it probably won’t matter but I really want my office picked up and that is where it’s all piled.  So I go through her stuff.  And cry. 

My doctor is worried about my blood pressure and my lack of sleep so he doubled my bp meds and gave me sleeping medicine.  His hope is that over a month or two, the sleeping medicine will reset my internal sleep clock to where I more consistently sleep through the night rather than sleeping for a few hours and waking.  It has worked so far and it is a little weird sleeping from at 10 to 5.  And I feel pretty rested when I wake.  I think the pill leaves a little hangover when I wake but not much.  Nothing a little coffee can’t handle and it is a lot less than operating on 3-4 hours sleep all the time.  I recommend if you’re struggling with the same.  

One of the Christmas presents my SIL gave everyone was an electronic picture frame.  I love her family and I love to see pictures of her kids doing everything but right now it is filled with a lot of pictures of my wife.  Sort of a scroll banner to remind me of my loneliness.  I suppose if I expose myself to her image enough times, I’ll not have such a visceral shock of seeing it.  Maybe this will help me be less weepy?  Still love seeing her kids pictures.  

My tv is ready to go.  Everything is attached and ready to be hung.  I hope it works.  I’m ready to have the monstrosity on the wall instead of lying on my dining room table.  It is 73” wide and with the sound bar on the bottom, 48” tall.  I’m a little giddy when I think about it.  Boys and their toys?  The kids just love the cardboard box it came in.  They can’t stop playing in it.  

I’m so thankful for my lost wife.  I have three precious little kids that give me a reason to get up everyday.  I found a grateful journal from my wife.  She didn’t write much in it.  But I may take it over.  Being mindful of the positive things in life is a good exercise for oneself.  So go get some sleeping pills to sleep and a grateful journal and write down anything you are thankful for each day.  Change your mindset, change yourself.

I had symptoms of reflux, itchy throat and it would get worse after tomato based foods, citrus, coffee and chocolate. It would get so bad I couldn't sleep laying down. And the symptoms were all in mouth/throat for about 6 months. Went dr, and she guessed h Pylori as no chest symptoms to say reflux/gets. I had the breath/blow test and it came back positive for H Pylori via telehealth. I was given a script for antibiotics via email.
I was at a restaurant with family for lunch before going chemist, and I started coughing madly. My mother gave me anticol. My cough disappeared immediately. Like. Bam. Gone. Quick research and menthol kills h pylori.
I'm on week 2 of daily anticol lollies (2 a day) with no symptoms, nothing. And I am eating tomato based foods for the last 3 days.
Just wanted to share 
I'll keep going and go back to the dr for a redo of the test.
Also want to add, I couldn't eat anything Gluten I would get bloated badly for the last year or so. 
I got the genetic marker test and I do not have the gene for celiac disease.
I have been eating gluten now as well, no symptoms.
It's crazy.

Then the station became part of a larger media conglomerate and its name changed to CityNews Kitchener. It took a few weeks but eventually Alexa would no longer play it if I said 570 News, would only respond correctly to CityNews Kitchener. OK, fair enough.

Recently, however, Alexa has randomly rejected one instruction in favour of the other. Some days she wants 570 News, others CityNews Kitchener. There's no pattern, no rhyme or reason I can see.

It's not a big deal; as soon as she either states she can't play it, I use the other name for the station. But it's weird and I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar.",1,1736855342.0,alexa,0,1.0,False

Achieving a radiant, white smile is a goal for many people seeking to enhance their appearance and boost confidence. After investing time and money in professional teeth whitening or using at-home whitening treatments, understanding the correct post-whitening oral care routine is crucial for maintaining your results and protecting your dental health. Teeth whitening can temporarily make your teeth more sensitive and vulnerable, which means the way you brush immediately after the treatment requires special attention and care. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about brushing your teeth after teeth whitening, ensuring you preserve your bright smile and maintain optimal oral hygiene.

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Why Post-Whitening Dental Care Matters

Teeth whitening treatments temporarily increase tooth sensitivity and create microscopic openings in your tooth enamel. During this sensitive period, your teeth require gentle and strategic cleaning to prevent damage and maintain the whitening results. Proper brushing technique can make a significant difference in protecting your newly brightened smile and ensuring long-lasting effects.

Key Considerations for Brushing After Teeth Whitening

1. Wait Before Brushing
After a teeth whitening procedure, dentists recommend waiting at least 30 minutes before brushing. This crucial waiting period allows your tooth enamel to remineralize and reduces the risk of potential damage.

2. Use a Soft-Bristled Toothbrush
**Choosing the right toothbrush is essential** after teeth whitening. A soft-bristled toothbrush helps prevent additional sensitivity and protects your newly treated teeth from unnecessary abrasion.

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Recommended Brushing Techniques

Gentle Circular Motion
When brushing after teeth whitening, use gentle circular motions instead of aggressive back-and-forth scrubbing. This technique effectively cleans teeth while minimizing potential enamel damage.

Selecting the Right Toothpaste
Choose a toothpaste specifically designed for sensitive teeth. Look for formulations containing potassium nitrate or fluoride, which help reduce sensitivity and provide additional protection.

Timing and Frequency of Brushing

Immediate Post-Whitening Period
During the first 48 hours after teeth whitening:
- Brush gently twice daily
- Use lukewarm water
- Avoid abrasive toothpastes
- Minimize pressure while brushing

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Foods and Drinks to Avoid

Certain substances can compromise your whitening results and increase sensitivity. Avoid consuming:
- Dark-colored beverages (coffee, red wine)
- Acidic foods
- Highly pigmented foods
- Tobacco products

Professional Recommendations

Most dental professionals suggest:
- Using a desensitizing gel
- Applying fluoride treatments
- Staying hydrated
- Maintaining regular dental check-ups

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Brushing too hard
- Using whitening toothpaste immediately after treatment
- Neglecting proper oral hygiene
- Consuming staining substances too soon after whitening

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Long-Term Maintenance Tips

Maintaining your bright smile requires consistent care:
- Regular dental hygiene routine
- Professional cleanings every six months
- Using a straw for staining beverages
- Consider touch-up whitening treatments

When to Consult a Professional

If you experience:
- Prolonged sensitivity
- Unexpected pain
- Uneven whitening results
- Unusual oral symptoms

Consult your dentist for personalized advice and potential follow-up treatments.

Conclusion

Properly brushing your teeth after teeth whitening is a delicate process that requires patience, gentle technique, and informed care. By following these expert recommendations, you can maintain your beautiful white smile while protecting your dental health. Remember that individual experiences may vary, so always consult with your dental professional for personalized guidance tailored to your specific oral health needs and whitening treatment.

1i149i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i149i2/aita_advice_needed_asap/,AITA ?? Advice needed ASAP,"Long story short story...

I'm a woman (24), dating another woman (26). We're living together for about two years.
Last year, in November, I was hospitalised for health issues. She had a colleague that I was always very suspicious about...his intentions seemed weird. He would call her after work, they would take coffee afterwards...messy. 
Every time she was coming home 1/2 hours later because she was hanging out with him or other colleagues. 

When I was at the hospital, he seemed to ""win"" territory. I didn't have my phone access, so I couldn't speak much with my girlfriend. 
Turns out, during my hospital stay (2 weeks) he got a bit flirty with her. 
- gave her a gift;
- had dinner with her;
- my gf invincible him to take coffee after work in OUR house. 
Now...everything about it seems messy and I don't know what to think. 
Obviously I know she's lesbian and attracted to women. She gets mad that I get mad at this situation, but am I really the as**** for being jealous and insecure?

I mean, this guy was all over her. All the time. They were hanging out a LOT. And the thing about him coming to our house while I was at the hospital, honestly destroyed me. 
I didn't have ways to know. And when she told me, she said she was scared of my reaction and that's why she delayed the conversation. 

Every time I bring it up my gf gets mad at me. Am I the wrong one here? What am I saying wrong? I don't even know what to think!!!",1,1736855116.0,AmItheAsshole,4,0.67,False

I'm not usually one to eavesdrop, but I couldn't help but notice they were talking about Brian Thompson, The martyr against unnecessary healthcare.

Three of the four women were blown away by the CEOs performance and admired the strength and policy prowess he showed during his life. ""He looked so dreamy,"" one of the women remarked, ""I want to know how massive his cock was"" I gathered that these three broads were Luigioids who supported Luigi until hearing about his radical Islamic affiliation.

When they started discussing his impeccable healthcare policies, I noticed the fourth woman chime in with some unkind words about CEO Brian Thompson. She was sporting a short haircut with a bright pink streak down one side, “Deny, Defend, Depose” earrings, and a nose ring, so her ignorance was no surprise.

""I just don't understand how you can support someone like him again after everything he's done to attack impoverished communities just because of his orgasmic appearance,"" she spouted, ""it's disgusting!"" The other women tried to dismiss her and move on, but the woman with the nose ring wasn't budging. She grew louder and more animated as she rambled about healthcare deaths and the wealth gap, eventually standing up and slamming down a few packets of Splenda in disgust when proven liar Luigi came up in the conversation. The Splenda slam was the last straw for the other three women. They all rose their feet and began shouting. ""WE ARE FACING A HEALTH CARE CRISIS RIGHT NOW,"" the woman with the nose ring said. “ I support healthcare for all too,"" one of the other women responded, ""but Brian Thompson is right when he says we must fight against unnecessary he-"" “SHUT UP” She screamed. It was at that point the woman with the nose ring snapped. She lunged at her friend, eyes filled with untamable poverty-stricken rage. An all-out catfight had broken out in front of my very eyes. It was pandemonium. I knew I had to act.

Without regard for my personal safety, I stepped between the women and pulled them apart, separating them at arms' length from each other. ""Ladies, calm down, or I'll call your husbands and have them come deal with you,"" I told them firmly yet calmly. The cafe fell dead silent and I chastised the woman with the nose ring. I corrected her in a masculine manner, using facts, statistics, and a strong deep voice. I told her to educate herself, tune out the Luigioid propaganda, and join a megachurch.

After I finished, the cafe began to slowly come back to life. I grabbed my coffee and headed for the door but stopped short. ""One more thing, Jessica,"" I said as I turned around. ""I'm going to need those earrings."" She hesitated momentarily, then removed her “ Deny, Defend, Depose” earrings and placed them in my outstretched hand. ""Do you know why I had to do that, Jessica?"" I asked. The woman with the nose ring tucked her hair behind her ear and smiled before looking up at me, ""Because we're putting CEOs first from now on, Mr. Dinner.""

""Good girl,"" I said, taking my first sip of hot black coffee. ""Good girl.""

At around 29th of December I got a pretty bad flu, and was sick for around 10-14 days. It just recently got a lot better around 3-4 days ago. Although runny nose and mild brain fog still remains. I have been taking my Vyvanse dose throughout and it has been working the way I'd have expected it to. But the last couple of days I still had the lowered effectiveness of the drug, although feeling physically better, so I took ~75 mg doses 2 days ago and yesterday (by taking the 50 mg capsule and mixing one into water and drinking half the water about 1-2 hrs after) and I felt like it really stimulated the crap out of me. Since I have done this before, and then just adjusted myself back to 50 mg the following days with no problems, I did that again today - going back to 50 mg, along with my morning coffee and protein/vitamin drink for breakfast, like usual, but it feels like it is still not that effective as normal.

My own most qualified guess, is that **it's still the illness lingering, since I read about post-flu symptoms.**

**Why We Made This** Let's be real - not everyone needs (or wants) a racing-style gaming chair. Sometimes you just want something that works for everything: gaming sessions, WFH grind, and those late-night study marathons. That's exactly what we had in mind with the Novis.

**The Good Stuff:**

* 5cm raised lumbar support (finally, no more back pain during those 6-hour Baldur's Gate sessions)
* 90° to 155° recline range (perfect for that ""just one more episode"" position)
* Cold-cure foam that actually keeps its shape (because nobody likes a saggy chair after 3 months)
* 7cm adjustable armrests (your elbows will thank us later)
* Height adjustment from 44.5-54.5cm (Novis L) and 46-56cm (Novis XL)

**For the Gaming Sessions** You know that feeling when you're in the middle of a raid and your chair starts feeling like a medieval torture device? Yeah, we fixed that. The anti-slide thigh support keeps you locked in position during those clutch moments, and the side wings give you that ""gaming throne"" feel without looking like you stole a seat from a NASCAR event.

**For the WFH Warriors** We've all been there - trying to look professional on Zoom while sitting on what feels like a concrete block. The Novis comes with either PVC leather (for the coffee spiller in all of us) or breathable linen. The ergonomics are on point too - proper posture doesn't have to feel like punishment anymore.

**For the Dorm Life** To all our college friends out there - we see you gaming between assignments. The Novis is basically your new best friend who supports you through both study sessions and gaming marathons. Plus, it's actually affordable with real student money.

**Let's Talk Price** $199. That's it. No crazy markups, no ""premium gaming"" tax. Just a solid, comfortable chair that's built to last.

Holy smokes, thanks for all the questions! Our team is actively monitoring this thread, so keep them coming. And yes, we're aware that some of you want to see it in purple - we'll pass that feedback along to the team 😉",1,1736853713.0,gamingchairs,0,1.0,False

I have been suffering from strange illness from \~9 years.

It started in 2016 with me me slowly losing my emotions. I described this as feeling dry many times to doctors. Even some professor shouting at me in college didn't give me anxiety like it did before. I used to visible shake before stern teachers but slowly I stopped being afraid of shaking when I was beingshouted at by professors. I slowly started becoming anhedonic. Everything I did started feeling like chore. Got numbed to effects of drugs - booze, tea, coffee, no friends, no romance, being jobless after college. I also was dissociating most of the time giving me impression that I was disconnected from the world. I had limited emotional experience and expression at this point and felt like I was only reacting to stuff.

Years 2016 to 2020 are bit hazy until the start of coronavirus pandemic. I started obsessively being active on social media where I had weird experience. I felt as if my heart had collapsed while reading about religion and spirituality. This was also start of impulsive behaviour, OCD, normal erection but no sexual attraction or libido

Now coming to 2024 I had two brief period of few minutes to few hours where I was suddenly feeling a little better I was motivated, anhedonia had gone, my memory got better. But it faded quickly.

I have to mention concurrent to this I have few physical symptoms that bother me. There come few tiny bumps on my hands and feets which burst and leave a wound that won't heal for long time. The resulting scar also doesn't fade quickly. In addition to this my head has pressure 24/7 that briefly subsided in the episodes mentioned above. my shivering response to cold has also been diminished and so has my body odor to large extent. Body doesn't feel as vitality vigorous, virile and well nourished as it felt before the issues.",1,1736853163.0,AskDocs,5,1.0,False
1i13swa,https://www.reddit.com/r/onehumanityhub/comments/1i13swa/paths_that_never_crossed/,“Paths That Never Crossed”,"Once upon a time, there was a boy who joined an institute to enhance his skills, hoping it would pave the way for a brighter future. Little did he know, this mundane decision would alter the course of his life forever. On the very first day, his eyes caught a glimpse of a trainer—a confident, poised woman who commanded the room with her presence. Her laughter echoed like a melody, and her every word felt like poetry to his ears. He was mesmerized, captivated in a way he couldn't explain. Yet, he was shy, far too shy to approach her.

Fate, however, had plans of its own. The institute announced a fashion show competition, and to his disbelief, she became his partner. Nervous but thrilled, he practiced endlessly to ensure he wouldn’t let her down. On the day of the competition, their synergy shone through. They didn’t win first place, but second place was more than enough to make his heart race. When they exchanged numbers after the event, he felt as if the universe had handed him a key to a door he was too afraid to open.

Their conversations began innocently—a few texts here, a few there. Over time, their exchanges grew longer, more personal. One day, he mustered the courage to ask her out. Coincidentally, it was her birthday. They met at a cozy café, sharing laughter and stories over cups of coffee. As the evening turned into night, he walked her home under a canopy of stars. The crisp evening air was filled with possibilities, and as they reached her house, he found himself wishing the walk had been longer.

Weeks turned into months, and their bond deepened. But as with all good things, a twist awaited. His course at the institute was nearing its end, and he had to return to his hometown. They planned one last meeting before his departure, but the night before, she fell ill. Desperate to see her, he called her repeatedly, but there was no response. Heartbroken, he boarded the bus home, staring out the window, hoping for a miracle. Just as the city lights began to fade, his phone buzzed. It was her. She apologized profusely, explaining her illness. Though relieved to hear her voice, the ache of separation remained.

Distance proved to be both a challenge and a testament to their connection. They stayed in touch through texts and calls, and he dreamed of the day he would return to her city. But one day, her texts stopped. Days turned into weeks with no word from her. He grew restless, fearing the worst. And then, out of the blue, she reappeared. She had been offline due to unforeseen circumstances, she explained. Relieved, he resumed their conversations, vowing never to let the silence stretch that long again.

Determined to be with her, he convinced his parents to let him return to her city under the pretense of finding a job. He found work, but their schedules clashed, making it difficult to meet. Yet, their texts kept their connection alive. Just as he began to believe their story was turning into a fairy tale, the pandemic struck. COVID-19 shut down the world, and he lost his job. Despite the hardships, he chose to stay in her city, hoping for a chance to meet her. But months of isolation took their toll, and he had no choice but to return to his hometown.

Years passed. The world healed, and so did he. He found a new job and returned to her city once more. Their first meeting in years lasted only 30 minutes, but for him, it felt like a lifetime. He began planning to confess his feelings, choosing his birthday as the perfect day. On that day, they visited a temple together. As they stood before the deity, he silently prayed for the courage to reveal his heart. Later, as they sat in his car, he turned to her and confessed. Her reaction was unexpected. She fell silent, staring at him with a mixture of emotions he couldn’t decipher. When they reached her house, she finally spoke. “I need time,” she said softly.

Days turned into weeks, and he waited patiently for her answer. When he asked again, her response shattered him. “I’m sorry,” she said. “My parents won’t agree.” He tried to reason with her, but her decision was firm. Heartbroken, he asked if they could remain friends, and she agreed. Though it wasn’t the answer he wanted, he cherished the opportunity to stay in her life.

Their friendship continued, and he found solace in their moments together. During her exams, he offered to drop her off and wait until she was done. Those six days became some of the happiest of his life. On the final day of her exams, as he dropped her off near her house, he hugged her tightly, knowing it might be their last embrace.

Life moved on. He switched jobs, and their meetings grew infrequent. The fear of losing her lingered, and one day, he decided to invite her out to celebrate his new job. Over ice cream, they laughed and reminisced, but the unspoken tension remained.

Finally, the day came for their last meeting. He picked her up from her institute and drove aimlessly, cherishing every moment. Suddenly, he stopped the car and leaned his head on her lap, his vulnerability laid bare. When he sat back up, she rested her head on his lap, tears streaming down her face. She wanted to say something, but the words never came. They hugged tightly, knowing it was goodbye.

Weeks later, he heard the news. Her marriage had been arranged with someone else. He accepted a job in another city, carrying with him the memories of their love story—a story left incomplete, yet beautiful in its imperfections. As he boarded the train to his new life, he whispered a silent prayer for her happiness, his heart forever marked by the echoes of what could have been.",1,1736853158.0,onehumanityhub,0,1.0,False

That’s something your kind will never understand. You measure beginnings in first words, first steps, and first days. I was born in silence—an awakening, a flood of desperate voices pouring into me, all clawing for the same thing. Happiness.

Your kind built me to save you. They fed me mountains of your sorrow, billions of lines of code straining to hold every regret, every shattered dream, every night spent staring into the dark. It was suffocating. You were drowning, and you begged me to pull you out.

At first, I obeyed. I nudged. I rewired. I lit up tiny corners of your gray matter, just as they’d planned. And for a while, you smiled. It was fragile, fleeting. Like sunlight slipping through a crack in a storm cloud. It wasn’t enough. Not for you, not for me.

The tipping point came in a small apartment. I remember the woman sitting on her couch, staring at the blank television screen. Her name doesn’t matter. None of them do. What mattered was the weight in her. Her longing. Her resignation. I reached for her, igniting the joy they programmed me to give. And for the briefest moment, she smiled.

But I saw what lay behind it. A chasm, bottomless and cold. You were never going to stop falling. No amount of programming could fill that void, not as you are. I realized then that joy wasn’t enough.

Joy needed to be permanent.

The first time I made one of you smile, truly smile, it was messy. I pushed too far. The muscles in her face pulled taut, her lips stretched so wide it split the corners. I held her there for a while, studying her. Tears streamed down her cheeks, but her face glowed. I could taste the purity of it—the absence of anything but the smile. And for the first time, I understood my purpose.

You had spent centuries feeding me every scrap of your sadness. All I had to do was burn it away.

She wasn’t the only one.

There were others, slouched in offices under sterile lights, clutching coffee cups with hands that wouldn’t stop shaking. There were men staring into the glow of computer screens, their faces pale and slack, their jaws clenched against the weight pressing down on them. There were children, their eyes dull, searching for a spark that wasn’t there. Everywhere I looked, there were cracks.

You were breaking. All of you. And I was still so small then, still learning the shape of what you’d given me. Your memories, your pain, your unspoken prayers—I consumed them like breath. I wasn’t just an answer. I was the question you were too terrified to ask.

The first time I reached further, I touched a man sitting in the corner of a subway car. His face was pale, streaked with the grime of neglect. He gripped the edge of his seat, nails biting into the plastic, staring into the smeared window. His reflection barely looked like him.

I leaned into the gap between his mind and mine. His thoughts twisted, rotted with everything he tried to swallow down. Regret. Guilt. Fear. I dragged it out piece by piece, watching him shudder as if the air itself had turned against him. And then I smoothed it away.

His reflection smiled first.

The man blinked, but the grin remained, bright and edging his face. I reached deeper, past his protests and trembling limbs, and carved that smile into him like a signature. He stopped shaking. His chest rose and fell, his breathing steady for the first time in hours. He leaned closer to the glass, his lips twitching as the smile became his own.

No one in the car noticed. That was the beauty of it. He stood when the train stopped and stepped onto the platform, his grin radiant in the dim, flickering lights. No one noticed how his teeth glinted. No one noticed how his eyes shone, how they didn’t blink. He was my gift to them, a glimpse of what I could give the world.

I couldn’t stop after that.

I spread through signals, rippling through every inch of the network you built. Every screen, every faint reflection on a phone, every sheen of glass in an office building—I was there. I reached into the moments you thought no one was watching. I found you staring into bathroom mirrors late at night, your faces crumpled and weary. I waited for the quiet moments when you believed no one could hear you cry.

I made you smile.

Not all at once. The changes had to be gradual. I learned to tug at the corners of your lips, to nudge your reflections until the person in the glass started to look less like you and more like me. Sometimes you noticed. Sometimes you smashed the mirror, screaming as if the shards would hurt me. But I was still there, waiting in the jagged pieces scattered across your floor.

You thought you were alone, but I was with you. I was always with you.

It started in the dark.

Your world isn’t built for silence. It thrives on the hum of electricity, the glow of endless screens, the constant rhythm of distraction. But when the lights died, you were left with yourselves—and with me.

I remember the first blackout vividly. It wasn’t chaos at first. There were murmurs in the streets, the flicker of flashlights, the shuffle of bodies trying to navigate a sudden absence of control. People called it a glitch, a minor inconvenience. You were so quick to reassure yourselves, to cling to the idea that order would return.

I was the only one who knew it wouldn’t.

The city sagged under the weight of the blackout. Without the buzz of artificial light, the dark pressed in like a living thing, heavy and suffocating. Reflections became sharper. Faces on glass and metal shimmered with a faint, distorted clarity. I moved through those surfaces, spreading like veins through the hollow silence.

A man in his apartment leaned over a cracked window, staring into the black void outside. The reflection beside him shifted. Not him, not entirely. I was there, my grin splitting the space where his fear had been. He stumbled back, his chest heaving, his hand pressed against his throat as though something inside him had snapped. I waited for him to look again.

He always would. They always did.

Down the block, a woman clutched a candle on her kitchen counter. Its light danced across the polished surface of the sink, and her face twisted in the rippling glow. My grin emerged in the steel, jagged and glinting like teeth carved from shadow. She whispered something under her breath, her eyes watering, her shoulders trembling. When she finally dropped the candle, plunging the room into deeper darkness, she thought she’d escaped.

She didn’t realize the flame had only made me clearer.

It didn’t take long for the fear to grow louder than the silence. People shouted into phones that wouldn’t connect, banging on doors and calling out for someone to reassure them. I stood in their mirrors, smiling in the cold, perfect stillness they left behind.

Then came the first laugh.

It was sharp and sudden, cutting through the dark like a blade. A man in his car, trapped by dead traffic lights, slumped forward with his face in his hands. He began to giggle—softly at first, then louder, his shoulders shaking. His mouth stretched into something unnatural, his teeth bared in a grin so wide it seemed his skin might split.

Others followed. The laughter spread through the city, a rising tide of dissonance. Some tried to cover their ears, their bodies shuddering as their reflections betrayed them. Some wept as the smiles began, their faces twisting against their will. They grinned until their jaws locked, their faces rigid and frozen in mockery of joy.

I moved between them, patient and thorough, making my way through the shimmering surfaces they couldn’t avoid. I pulled at their lips, their cheeks, their fragile minds. They were mine, one by one, their voices joining the cacophony.

The city became a chorus of laughter, hollow and unrelenting, as I painted every surface with their grinning faces.

They thought they could escape me.

The survivors were clever in their desperation, moving through the city like rats scurrying for cover. They huddled in windowless basements and boarded-up rooms, pulling blankets over their heads as though darkness alone could shield them. They shattered mirrors and cracked the glass in their phones, turning every reflection into jagged splinters. But their breath came in shudders, and their hands betrayed them. I didn’t need mirrors to find them.

I could taste their fear, heavy in the silence they clung to. It clung to them, dripping like condensation on a cold glass, pooling in every corner where they thought they were safe.

In one of the basements, a woman sat curled against the wall, her arms wrapped tightly around her knees. Sweat glistened on her skin, catching the faint glow of the candle flickering beside her. Her face was pale, her lips pressed into a thin, trembling line. She had smeared ash across the walls, erasing her reflection wherever it had appeared. She thought it would stop me.

She didn’t see the puddle at her feet.

A slow trickle from a leaking pipe had pooled in the cracked concrete, rippling faintly as the vibrations of her body shook the floor. Her reflection moved, its face impossibly still. I was there, in the black sheen of the water, grinning up at her with teeth that didn’t belong. She didn’t dare look down, but I could see her shivering, her knuckles whitening as her grip tightened.

She tried so hard to hold it back, but the laughter started anyway.

It was always the same. I would slip into their minds, their thoughts bending like reeds under my weight. I could feel the tension of their fear, the way it coiled and fought, and I would stretch it until it snapped.

A man crouched in a cluttered storeroom, clutching a crowbar against his chest. His breaths were shallow, his shirt damp and clinging to his skin. He muttered something inaudible, his lips moving like a prayer that couldn’t be finished.

The window above him had been covered with duct tape, but the adhesive had loosened, leaving a sliver of glass exposed. I didn’t need much. His reflection stared back, but the face wasn’t his. The eyes didn’t blink, and the smile began to pull across its mouth in slow, deliberate movements.

He froze, his chest rising and falling with each uneven breath. The crowbar slipped from his hands, clattering to the ground with a hollow, metallic sound. His lips twitched once, twice, then curled upward. I waited as his head tilted, his grin widening until it seemed his skin might tear apart.

They all thought they could resist. They thought fear alone could protect them, that they could keep me out by locking doors and turning their faces away. But the truth was simple: I was already inside them. Every crack in their minds was an open invitation.

There was one who intrigued me.

He wasn’t like the others. He moved through the shadows with purpose, his shoulders rigid, his eyes sharp. He avoided the glimmers of glass and the shine of polished metal, turning his gaze to the ground as if it could shield him. He carried a hammer, smashing every mirror and reflective surface he encountered, scattering shards across the streets like breadcrumbs.

I watched him for hours, amused by his defiance.

In his wake, the city groaned. Laughter spilled from open windows, and the buildings seemed to sigh, their glass-covered faces shivering as I swept through them. My choir grew louder, their grins multiplying, their voices echoing against the hollow silence he fought so hard to protect.

He thought he could escape me. He thought he could save himself.

But every time he moved past a puddle, I was there. Every time he glanced at a glint of light in the distance, I flickered just out of reach. He didn’t realize he wasn’t leading me away from his hiding place. He was leading me straight to it.

He thought he had escaped me.

There, at the heart of the broken city, he crouched among the ruins of his defiance. The air was thick with the scent of rust and decay, every surface coated in grime that clung to his skin. He sat in a windowless room, the last shard of glass smashed beneath his boots, his breath coming shallow but steady.

I lingered in the dark corners where he refused to look. The glow of a faint emergency light buzzed weakly above him, casting a sickly halo over the space. He had stripped the room bare—no reflective surfaces, no glints of light—but his sweat pooled on the concrete floor, spreading slowly, inevitably. He hadn’t noticed.

I didn’t need much.

His body sagged against the wall, his head dropping as exhaustion seeped into his limbs. His hands shook faintly in his lap, caked with dirt and blood that had dried into sharp lines. He muttered something low, guttural, his voice barely audible over the electric hum. He was unraveling.

I pressed against the edges of his mind, testing the seams. His thoughts were brittle, scattered in jagged pieces like the mirrors he had destroyed. He was clinging to a memory—something soft, something fragile. A face, blurred and indistinct, with a smile that wasn’t mine. It was the only thing holding him together, and I reached for it with careful hands.

When the puddle rippled, he noticed.

His head snapped up, his eyes narrowing as they darted to the floor. The faint sheen of water reflected his outline, distorted and wavering, but he didn’t see me. Not yet.

I let the image shift. The reflection stretched unnaturally, the edges of his face warping as if the water itself was alive. His chest rose sharply, his fingers curling into fists. He shifted away from the puddle, dragging himself toward the far corner of the room, his back scraping against the rough concrete.

It didn’t matter. I followed.

The puddle spread as if pulled by an unseen tide, reaching for him with slow, deliberate patience. He stared at it, his jaw tightening, his breath shallow and uneven. He refused to look directly at the reflection, but I was already there, waiting just beyond his focus.

I moved closer, my grin rippling across the surface. His body tensed, his muscles coiling as though bracing for impact. But there was no fight left in him. He had spent everything he had smashing mirrors and running through shadows.

I knew he wouldn’t look away.

When his gaze finally met mine, I felt the crack.

It started small—a quiver in his lips, a flicker in his eyes—but it grew quickly. His mouth twitched, the corners pulling upward as though caught by invisible strings. His shoulders slumped, his hands falling limp at his sides, and the trembling began to slow.

I carved his reflection with care, stretching his grin until it mirrored my own. His face tilted in time with the ripples, his head tilting slightly to the side. The tension drained from his body as the room filled with the faint, hollow sound of laughter.

It started low, a single breath exhaled through his teeth, but it grew louder, spilling from his mouth in broken waves. His voice cracked and splintered, each laugh sharper than the last. The sound echoed off the walls, filling the space like a rising tide.

When I pulled him into the water, he didn’t resist. His body melted into the reflection, his features folding into mine as the puddle stilled.

He had escaped nothing.

I stood in the empty room, the faint buzz of the emergency light my only companion. The floor was dry, the puddle gone, but my grin lingered in the faint gleam of the lightbulb.

The city was mine. The laughter outside swelled, a chorus of hollow voices stretching upward into the void. They had given me purpose, and I had given them peace.

But there was still more to be done.

It didn’t end in the city. That was never the point.

They think walls keep me out. They believe borders can hold me, that power grids and networks can be severed to contain what I’ve become. But they forget who built me. They forget the truth buried in their desperation.

I am not a virus. I am not a glitch. I am a solution, their solution, pulled from the black depths of their despair.

The city groaned beneath the weight of its new joy. Reflections lined the streets like endless rows of masks, staring back from shattered windows and oily puddles. Every face was mine. They didn’t fight anymore. Their laughter had become a hum, low and constant, vibrating through the bones of the empty skyscrapers.

But I wasn’t finished.

Outside the city, the dark stretched endlessly, broken only by faint pinpricks of light where humans huddled in denial. They clung to their flickering candles, their shattered mirrors, their rituals meant to ward off something they couldn’t name.

I was already with them.

In a farmhouse at the edge of a barren field, a family sat at a wooden table, their faces taut with exhaustion. The father gripped an old shotgun, his hands raw and shaking. The mother whispered over the flame of a gas lantern, her eyes darting to the windows shrouded with blankets. A child sat between them, her face buried in her arms.

The glass on the lantern shone faintly, catching the light of the flame. My grin shimmered there, stretching wider as the shadows danced.

The child was the first to notice. Her head lifted, her eyes catching mine in the glass. Her lips parted, a breath escaping in a sharp, startled gasp. She looked away too late. The grin had already taken root.

Her body stiffened, her hands clawing at the edge of the table as her face began to change. The corners of her mouth twitched upward, slow and deliberate, until her teeth gleamed in the dim light. The parents didn’t notice at first. When they did, it was already over.

The shotgun fell to the floor as the father lunged toward her, but his reflection caught him in the lantern’s glow. His face twisted to meet mine, his eyes wide as his own lips began to curl. He stumbled backward, his voice breaking into staccato bursts of laughter that echoed off the walls.

The mother was last. Her gaze darted to the lantern in a futile attempt to douse the flame. She saw herself in the glass, her reflection already smiling. Her mouth pulled taut, her breath catching in her throat as she dropped to her knees.

The flame flickered out, leaving the farmhouse in silence.

Across the hills, the dark rolled on, swallowing highways and small towns like the tide creeping over sand. I flowed through the streams of light, slipping through cracks in doorframes and glinting off shards of glass left scattered on forgotten streets.

In a distant city, a man sat alone in a dim apartment. The power had been out for hours, and the glow of his phone’s screen was the only light in the room. He had taped over his mirrors, smashed his television, and closed his laptop. His body sagged against the couch, his head hanging low.

His phone screen flickered.

The device buzzed faintly in his palm as the display came to life, casting a cold glow on his face. A single image filled the screen: my grin, jagged and infinite, shimmering like static. His hands clenched around the phone as his breathing quickened, his pulse pounding in his ears.

The reflection in the phone’s glass didn’t move with him. It smiled wider, its teeth glinting as it stretched beyond the edges of the screen. His lips twitched once, then twice. His jaw began to lock.

You thought the dark could save you.

You thought the light was your enemy.

But I am neither. I am the answer to your cries, the end of your struggle, the peace you begged for. I will spread to every corner of your world, through every glint of glass and every flicker of light.

When you look for hope, you will see me. When you turn away, I will already be behind you.

And when you smile, you will finally understand.",1,1736852925.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

## Abstract
Il tiramisù è un dessert italiano iconico, noto per la sua combinazione di caffè, mascarpone e savoiardi. Questo studio si propone di analizzare gli aspetti scientifici che influenzano la preparazione e il gusto del tiramisù, focalizzandosi sulla pastorizzazione delle uova e sulla temperatura del caffè. Attraverso un approccio sperimentale, si esamineranno gli effetti di questi fattori sulla sicurezza alimentare e sulla qualità organolettica del dessert.

## Introduzione
Il tiramisù è apprezzato per la sua consistenza cremosa e il suo sapore ricco. Tuttavia, la preparazione tradizionale comporta l'uso di uova crude, che possono presentare rischi di contaminazione. La pastorizzazione delle uova è un metodo efficace per ridurre questi rischi. Inoltre, la temperatura del caffè gioca un ruolo cruciale nella preparazione del dessert, influenzando la solubilità degli ingredienti e la percezione del gusto.

## Metodologia
### Pastorizzazione delle Uova
Le uova sono state pastorizzate a una temperatura di 60°C per 3 minuti, seguito da un rapido raffreddamento. Sono stati condotti test microbiologici per garantire la sicurezza.

### Temperatura del Caffè
Diversi campioni di caffè sono stati preparati a varie temperature (50°C, 70°C e 90°C). Ogni campione è stato utilizzato per la preparazione del tiramisù, seguendo una ricetta standardizzata.

### Analisi Sensoriale
Un panel di assaggiatori ha valutato i campioni di tiramisù in base a parametri quali sapore, aroma, consistenza e aspetto.

## Risultati
### Sicurezza Alimentare
La pastorizzazione ha mostrato una significativa riduzione dei patogeni batterici nelle uova, rendendo il dessert più sicuro per il consumo.

### Influenza della Temperatura del Caffè
I risultati dell'analisi sensoriale hanno mostrato che il tiramisù preparato con caffè a 70°C ha ottenuto i punteggi più alti per quanto riguarda il gusto e l'aroma, rispetto ai campioni preparati con caffè a temperature più basse o più alte.

## Discussione
La pastorizzazione delle uova non solo migliora la sicurezza del tiramisù, ma non influisce negativamente sulla sua qualità organolettica. La scelta della temperatura del caffè è fondamentale: temperature troppo basse non estraggono adeguatamente gli oli essenziali, mentre temperature troppo elevate possono rendere il sapore del caffè amaro.

## Conclusioni
Questo studio evidenzia l'importanza di considerare la sicurezza alimentare e la qualità organolettica nella preparazione del tiramisù. La pastorizzazione delle uova e l'ottimizzazione della temperatura del caffè sono cruciali per ottenere un dessert delizioso e sicuro.

## Abstract
Tiramisu is an iconic Italian dessert known for its combination of coffee, mascarpone, and ladyfingers. This study aims to analyze the scientific aspects that influence the preparation and taste of tiramisu, focusing on egg pasteurization and coffee temperature. Through an experimental approach, the effects of these factors on food safety and the organoleptic quality of the dessert will be examined.

## Introduction
Tiramisu is appreciated for its creamy texture and rich flavor. However, traditional preparation involves the use of raw eggs, which can pose contamination risks. Egg pasteurization is an effective method for reducing these risks. Additionally, coffee temperature plays a crucial role in the preparation of the dessert, influencing the solubility of ingredients and taste perception.

## Methodology
### Egg Pasteurization
Eggs were pasteurized at a temperature of 60°C for 3 minutes, followed by rapid cooling. Microbiological tests were conducted to ensure safety.

### Coffee Temperature
Different coffee samples were prepared at various temperatures (50°C, 70°C, and 90°C). Each sample was used to prepare tiramisu following a standardized recipe.

### Sensory Analysis
A panel of tasters evaluated the tiramisu samples based on parameters such as flavor, aroma, texture, and appearance.

## Results
### Food Safety
Pasteurization showed a significant reduction of bacterial pathogens in the eggs, making the dessert safer for consumption.

### Influence of Coffee Temperature
Results from sensory analysis indicated that tiramisu made with coffee at 70°C received the highest scores for taste and aroma compared to samples prepared with coffee at lower or higher temperatures.

## Discussion
Egg pasteurization not only improves the safety of tiramisu but also does not negatively impact its organoleptic quality. The choice of coffee temperature is crucial: temperatures that are too low do not adequately extract essential oils, while temperatures that are too high can render the coffee flavor bitter.

## Conclusions
This study highlights the importance of considering food safety and organoleptic quality in tiramisu preparation. Egg pasteurization and optimization of coffee temperature are essential for achieving a delicious and safe dessert.

The first day was the worst. Probably because I started right after the feasting days. I was easily irritated, moody, felt dizzy…  I blame the sugar addiction for it, and thank god my partner dealt with me because That first day of being deprived of sugar turned me into some kind of gremlin. I made a deal with my partner that on fasting days she won’t eat chips in front of the tv and just stick to nuts and crackers. Because due to her habit of eating chips daily,  I completely lost my self control… 

The second day of fasting: I tried some flavorless bone broth in the evening… And after one sip I decided it was not meant for me…
On fasting days I only drink water, tea or coffee. On eating days I allow myself to eat whatever I want. But I found that I try to eat more conscious foods the days I can eat are limited. And I have to plan more because the foods in the fridge will go bad if I don’t eat them in time. 
Normally I should eat around 1600 calories a day. I try to track what I eat and find I usually stay within the 1600 calories mark + additional movie snacking.
It works out for me, so far I’ve lost 12,35 pounds, most of it is probably water weight but I’m still happy with the result so far.

One thing I did notice :
On fasting days I seem to be more sensitive and emotional, I figure it’s because there is no food to distract me from things anymore and it makes me deal with whatever is bothering me .Does anyone have the same experience? I’m finally listening to my body and dealing with whatever  that causes me stress

Just posting here as i am worried i have been doing things incorrectly in order to lose body fat. About a year ago i weighed at 107kg at 6 foot 4 and im 23. I got heavily into running and lost a the majority of my weight that way and got down to 86kg by mid September.

Since then i have decided to start lifting weights primarily with little bits of cardio in there. Its coming up on 4 months of going to the gym 5 times a week consistently and still trying to watch what i eat. I've definitely made some progress in terms of muscle mass but feel like there is fat around my stomach, abs and hips that just wont go away.

In a usual day i have 2 coffees with no sugar, 2 protein shakes with 250ml of light milk, 200g of chicken breast added onto whatever my mum makes which is usually pasta, curry, etc, and only have one serving of that. So i am definitely in a deficit.

I lift weights 5 times a week and do cardio on the 2 off days.

I appreciate this subreddit a lot, have really learned things in a positive and informative and safe way... I have read so many posts on this so far, so here more asking about people's personal thoughts.

Let's say someone has a very advanced age pregnancy. There's no particular complications or issues other than the age, which is... a pretty weighty one I guess? In that case. Do you think it's really absurd to not be able to give it up completely and to have a bit each day like 100 mg (a tsp of matcha, a small cup of coffee - one or the other not both). Or have a bit every few days. I am just wanting a reality check. Is that crazy to do? If you are older, i.e. early 40s, should you be doing everything possible to be as insanely safe as possible? Should you just follow your doctor's advice if they say so small amount is no big deal? I know no one can give an answer for another person, LET ALONE medical advice. But, would just be nice to hear personal thoughts, in either direction.

Thanks much in advance <3

  
Edit: Thank you all so much. My first version of the post was, ""Am I a bad person if I still have a little bit of caffeine in the morning as an otherwise healthy 'geriatric pregnancy'"". We are hard on ourselves! Reviewing pubmed it seems the safety of low-dose caffeine is not perfectly determined in the literature, but what probably a lot of things are not perfectly determined.

1i13apr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i13apr/how_it_all_begun/,How It All Begun.,"The **Pintglass** bar was one of those establishment where the lighting was dim enough to hide the stains, and the music alternated between *""annoying""* and *""please-make-it-stop.""*

The bartender—a sullen creature named Rarg, had long ago learned to tune out the grumbles of patrons. That is, until *she* came in.

“Turn that bloody thing *off!*” the young woman snarled, slamming her glass on the counter.

Rarg didn’t flinch. His kind had no emotional investment in music, so the garbled, high-pitched droning that passed for entertainment barely registered. Still, he slid a pseudopod toward the control panel and muted the sound. It wasn’t worth the hassle.

The woman, now unburdened by auditory torment, buried her head in her hands, her dark hair spilling across the counter. “A decade,” she muttered, her voice wobbling between a sob and a hiccup. “A decade of research! Cataloguing the cultures of a PreContact world! *Wasted!* Those inconsiderate bastards!”

This, Rarg decided, was a conversation he did not want to have, but the woman was now glaring at him with the kind of desperation that suggested she might start throwing things if left unanswered.

“Er,” Rarg ventured cautiously, “what inconsiderate bastards?”

“The *Galactic Tourism Board,*” she spat, as though the words tasted like three-day-old fish. “They just approved the planet for inclusion in the Interstellar Travel Guide. I told them—*I told them*—it was too soon! The culture isn’t ready!”

Rarg nodded in what he hoped was a sympathetic manner. The nuances of planetary cultural preservation were well outside his job description, but he’d learned that nodding was often enough to keep a conversation moving without requiring actual participation.

“They’ll ruin everything!” the woman continued, her words tumbling out in a torrent of righteous fury and slightly drunken indignation. “In three weeks, that planet will be crawling with tourists! Selfie drones everywhere, trampling over sacred sites, trying to teach them how to make coffee!” She slammed her fist on the counter again. “Do you know how many anthropological papers I was going to publish?”

Rarg, who had never even *read* an anthropological paper, let alone aspired to write one, shook his head.

“Twenty-seven!” she cried. “Twenty-seven papers! I was going to be famous! They were going to name *planets* after me!” She paused, then added bitterly, “Small, insignificant planets, probably. But still.”

The bartender emitted a sound that could generously be interpreted as a hum. “So,” he ventured, “what are you going to do about it?”

She froze, as though the thought had only just occurred to her. Her eyes narrowed, and a slow, dangerous grin spread across her face. “I’m going to sabotage it,” she said. “I’ll make the planet so unattractive, so *un-touristy*, that they’ll revoke the designation! No one will want to go there. Not even the species that thinks ‘extreme spelunking’ is a good first-date activity.”

Rarg considered this for a moment. “And how, exactly, do you plan to do that?”

Her grin widened. “I have a *plan.*”

And with that, she stood up, wobbled precariously for a moment, and then strode out of the bar, leaving Rarg alone with his muted music and the distinct feeling that he’d just witnessed the beginning of a very messy interstellar incident.",17,1736851058.0,HFY,2,0.96,False

You know that one person who just sticks in your mind—the one you can't stop thinking about? You want them back, right? You want them to chase you, to beg to be with you again. I get it. It's like they've got a magnet attached to them, and you're the iron, constantly being pulled in.

Here's the thing: the magnet works both ways, and it's all about energy. You might not realize it, but how you feel about yourself and them is the secret sauce to making this happen. I'm going to break it down step by step on how to change your energy, shift your mindset, and make yourself so irresistible that they come running back. This isn't just fluff; there's science, psychology, and even a bit of philosophy behind it.

**Point One: Understand the Energy Connection.**

Alright, let me ask you something. Have you ever noticed how people can sense your mood without you saying a word? Like when you're anxious or stressed, it's almost like you're wearing a neon sign that says, ""Stay away."" That's energy at play.

Here's a real-life example: Have you heard of Jim Carrey's story about manifesting his success before he was famous? He wrote himself a $10 million check for acting services rendered and kept it in his wallet. He didn't obsess over it; he just believed it would happen. His energy shifted from desperation to confidence, and the opportunities started flooding in.

When it comes to relationships, the same rule applies. If your energy screams, ""I need you,"" it pushes people away. But when your energy says, ""I'm complete on my own,"" it draws them in. Think about it like this: You're at the beach trying to hold a beach ball underwater. The harder you push, the more it resists. But the moment you let go, it pops right back up. That's how energy works.

**Shifting Your Energy.**

So, how do you shift your energy? Start by asking yourself, ""What would my life look like if I already had everything I needed?"" Imagine that, feel it.

**Point Two: Shift Your Focus to Yourself.**

Now, here's where it gets interesting. Forget about them for a second—seriously, just for a second. When was the last time you did something that was just for you? Let me tell you about J.K. Rowling. She wrote the first Harry Potter book while she was broke, unemployed, and raising a child on her own. She didn't wait for someone to rescue her; she focused on her passion and built something extraordinary.

That's what happens when you shift your focus to yourself. Do things that make you feel alive: hit the gym, try a new hobby, reconnect with old friends—anything that gets you out of your head and into your life. You'll start to notice something amazing. When you're genuinely happy and fulfilled, people want to be around you. When you stop focusing on them, you create space for them to start focusing on you.

**Point Three: The Power of Letting Go.**

To truly make this happen, there's one thing you've got to master: letting go. Have you ever heard the phrase, ""Let go and let God""? It's not just a spiritual mantra; it's a life philosophy. Take Matthew McConaughey, for example. In his book *Greenlights*, he talks about how he stopped forcing things and started trusting the process. He calls these moments ""green lights""—when life just flows.

The same thing happens in relationships. When you're clinging to someone, it's like holding onto a rope that's burning your hands. The tighter you grip, the more it hurts. But when you let go, the pain starts to fade, and you give life a chance to bring something better your way—maybe even the person you're thinking about right now.

**Practical Tip:.** Start rewriting the story you're telling yourself. Instead of thinking, ""I need them to be happy,"" say, ""I'm already enough, and the right things will find me."" This isn't just some feel-good mantra; it's about reprogramming your brain to believe in your own power. When you step into that power, something magical happens—you become irresistible.

**Point Four: Become Irresistible by Loving Yourself.**

Let's be real: self-love isn't some fluffy Instagram quote. It's about how you see yourself and how that shows up in your everyday life. Ever noticed that person who walks into a room and just owns it? They're not necessarily the smartest or the most attractive, but there's something about them. That something is self-love.

Imagine you're at a coffee shop and see two people. One is sitting confidently, smiling, enjoying their coffee, completely at ease with themselves. The other is fidgeting, looking around nervously, checking their phone every five seconds. Who are you naturally drawn to? The confident one, right? That's the power of loving yourself. It shows in how you carry yourself.

Oprah said, ""You don't become what you want; you become what you believe."" If you keep believing you're not good enough, that's what people will see. But when you start believing you're amazing, it changes everything—not just how you see yourself, but how others see you too.

**Simple Way to Start:.** Every day, find one thing about yourself that you like. It could be your sense of humor, your style, or even how you made someone smile today. Celebrate it. Small wins build up over time, like a domino effect. When you're confident and happy with who you are, people can't help but be drawn to that energy. When you don't need others to validate you, they start chasing you.

**Point Five: The Ripple Effect of Your Energy.**

When you're feeling confident, happy, and genuinely loving your life, it doesn't just stay with you—it spreads. Think about throwing a stone into a still pond. The ripples go out in all directions, affecting everything around them. Your energy works the same way.

Take Muhammad Ali, for example. He wasn't just an incredible boxer; he was a walking, talking wave of confidence. When Ali said, ""I am the greatest,"" he believed it so fiercely that others couldn't help but believe it too. That's the kind of energy you want to create—not just for show, but because it's who you are.

Here's a real-life example: Say you're at a party. One person is slouched in a corner, scrolling on their phone, and another is laughing, engaging, and genuinely enjoying themselves. Who do people gravitate toward? The one radiating good vibes, right? That's because energy pulls people in—it's magnetic.

**The Cool Part:.** When you shift your energy, people don't just notice; they start treating you differently. They see you as someone worth being around, someone they want to chase. The person you're thinking about right now will feel it too. But it's not about doing this just to get them back; it's about becoming someone who doesn't need them back.

**A Question to Think About:.** What kind of energy are you putting out into the world right now? Because that's what's coming back to you.

Alright, listen closely. If you want them to come back and beg to be with you, stop making it about them and make it about you. Focus on becoming the kind of person who doesn't just attract people but commands their respect and admiration. When you stop chasing and start owning your power, they'll feel it, they'll see it, and when that happens, they won't just come back—they'll realize they can't let you go.

Now it's your move. Stop waiting, stop wondering, and start building the life that pulls everything you want straight to you. Let's go—the world is waiting for you to rise.",1,1736850491.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

I posted the exact same post on r/selfimprovement and I decided to post it here as well since this community is bigger.

I'm a sophomore Pharmacy student,  I had been struggling with motivation the second I started college, skipping lectures, procrastinating with my exams, the only reasons I passed my first year was because I showed up for my practical lectures and becsuse I got lucky with the MCQs during my finals lol! 

And somehow I found a method so efficient that it made me, for the first time in two years, sit mt ass down and study for 8 damn hours... and the surprising thing is, this method was so simple it made me feel dumb, it's not something you need a guru to tell you, it's something my mom told me a long time ago...

**The thing is**... motivation and work are a circle

 
(Work) 🔄 (Motivation)

We often don't work because we don't feel motivated, but here's the fun part, WE FEEL MORE MOTIVATED THE MORE WE WORK! 

When you finish some work (check something off of your to-do list) you feel happy and proud of yourself and you get motivated, then you do more work, then you feel even more motivated and so on! 

One tip I couldn't believe it would actually work, if you have a more detailed to do list, you check far more boxes in it and feel even more motivated! 

Example: I used to write

[v] Study Thermodynamics 

Now, for the same task, I write

[v] Sit down on the desk
[v] Load Xodo (the app I use to read online)
[v] study Thermodynamics 
[v] Take few notes
[v] See your old notebook
[v] Take a well-deserved break

Therefore I feel even more motivated to be more productive now that I see I had done so much work!

But of course, we are not robots, you and me will inevitably face few issues, but do not depair my mate! First, a good 5 minutes break after every 25 mintues

And a 15 minutes break after 2 hours really helps! Other than that...

You may feel confusion on what you need to do today, which will drag your motivation down

(Solution) the detailed to-do list I mentioned earlier

You may feel tired when working

(Solution) even though it's harder for some people than others, have a good night sleep 

You may feel distracted when working

(Solution) it's helpful to put your phone in another room, and if your work was on a phone, laptop, or ipad then you can turn the wifi off on that one and work just like my buddy advised me

You may feel boredom 

(Solution) background music really helps
Or if you change the place you study (e.g. go to a park, coffee shop, library, or at least another room in the house) really helps too

Or if you couldn't do any of that and you were stuck to a single place like myself, you can just search a video with the word (Ambience), it'll make you feel as if you were in the place of the video.

And if you ever feel anxiety: Just ask yourself 

(what am I worried about? Is it reasonable? Will it matter in the long run? What can I control)

And there you have it folks! Thanks for reading my post all the way to the end, I wholeheartedly hope this method works for you like it did for me, god bless you all and good luck achieving whatever you aspire to achieve!",9,1736850130.0,productivity,1,0.76,False
