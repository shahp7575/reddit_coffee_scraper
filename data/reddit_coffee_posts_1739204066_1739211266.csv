Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while while having a smoke and watching Dutch streamers react too a show called “lang leve de liefde”   .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)
- a lot of random playlists I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things ( example the weather , how much milk cows produce , songs I wish didn’t exist ?)
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually ( no you don’t have to drink coffee I certainly will ) 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 
-Dutch memes but you won’t get ;) ( what a steal ! )

Good MORNING SCIENTISTS! What a beatiful day in the depths of creation!

You may remember me from this post from a while ago, back in the (comparatively) earlier days of this little 'incident' at the GATE Cascade Research Facility, before I lost (what was left of) my sanity: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AbioticFactor/comments/1dqgync/how\_long\_can\_you\_continuously\_shit\_for\_in\_abiotic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AbioticFactor/comments/1dqgync/how_long_can_you_continuously_shit_for_in_abiotic/)

Since then I have evolved from merely theorizing about shit, to active weaponization of it. I have killed thousands of Triarii with mugnades alone.

But recently, I have been able to evolve further. I am making weapons of even greater mass destruction and combining my mugnades together to FIRE THEM OUT OF A ROCKET LAUNCHER in the form of Cluster Rockets. Which I am now stockpiling in the hopes of eventually getting enough to use to blow a hole through the ceiling of this damn facility and get out of here once and for all.

For those who wish to share in my endeavour, I will math out the amount of shit that would be required. All calculations will assume Level 12 Throwing for the extra crafting efficiency on throwables.

I used some random sciency tape measure thing from Manufacturing to estimate that to break through the weakest available section of the ceiling, we'll need about 561,091 such rockets (Gotta give props to whoever designed that ceiling goddamn.)

Each Cluster Rocket requires one regular rocket, one Cluster Grenade, and one Detonation Cord.

The rocket itself needs 1 Plutonic Blood, 8 Metal Scrap, 4 Plastic Scrap, and one Detonation Cord.

Cluster Grenades require 5 Mugnades and yet another Detonation Cord to make 2. Mugnades require 1 Soil Bag (1 shit and 2 bio scrap), 1 empty coffee mug, 1 chain, and 1 pressure gauge to make 4.

Detonation Cord is a sub-component that needs 1 PETN, 6 Cloth Scraps and 4 Glue (fisherman or giga variety).

This means, for each Cluster Rocket, we'll need:  
1 Plutonic Blood  
8 Metal Scrap  
4 Plastic Scrap  
1.2 Feces  
2.4 Bio Scrap  
1.2 Empty Mugs  
1.2 Chain  
1.2 Pressure Gauge  
3 PETN  
18 Cloth Scrap  
12 Glue.

Additionally, the Rocket Launcher itself has only 30 durability and uses 1 durability every time it is fired, requiring a Detonation Cord to repair. So effectively, each rocket needs an extra 1/30 of a detonation cord for durability expenses.

All in all, I have a plan to escape the facility. But we will need:  
\-561,091 Plutonic Blood (hope you're good at killing exors)  
\-4,488,728 Metal Scraps (that's almost 250k anvils you'd need to scrap if you're using that metal farming method)  
\-2,244,364 Plastic Scraps (still less than the amount that's in Earth's oceans right now! remember to recycle if we ever get out of here!)  
\-1,346,619 Bio Scraps (Fortunately, you won't need to worry about this step. I've already killed enough Order with shitnades to get this much from scrapping the brains and arms.)  
\-673,310 empty coffee mugs (Go ask Thule)  
\-673,310 Chains (why do we even need these to make bombs?)  
\-673,310 Pressure Gauges (what's even in these that we need? glass? tech scrap? why can't we just get those instead?)  
\-1,683,273 PETN (time to start farming Saboters)  
\-10,099,638 Cloth Scraps (which would take my wife a shorter amount of time to put on than how long she takes to get dressed every morning. Just kidding, my wife got eaten by a Composer a couple months ago.)  
\-6,733,092 Glue (that's 1,122,182 boiled peccary skulls)  
\-And of course, 673,310 piles of poop.

You'd also need to repair the launcher 18,704 times, costing 18,704 more PETN, 112,224 more Cloth Scraps, and 74,816 EXTRA glue on top of all that.

I know this is quite a big ask, scientists, but no way are we trusting that rat Hasta Tria to get us out of here. Residence sector? Stop Gatekeepers from using the Dark Lens to destroy the world? Psht, nonsense. We don't need any of that, we're getting out the SCIENCE way. Drop the materials off when you're ready to go.

This is my first ever reddit post, but I need some impartial advice and hoped the Waffle Gang could help. This might be a long one and throwaway because I don't know if he uses reddit. 

I (24f) have been friends with Daniel (25m) for five years. We met in 2020 through a drama society at uni and became friends quite quickly, but only a couple of months into knowing each other, covid hit. 

When everything moved online, this drama group became pretty much my entire social life, and Daniel and I messaged almost daily. For a month, it was a little flirty, and I kinda liked him. However, he became intense very quickly, telling me he missed me every day and how he wanted to 'cuddle.' 

Now, a key piece of info about me: I am anxiety in human form and 1000% a people pleaser. So, when I started getting uncomfortable, I tried to let him down gently, telling him I had a lot on and asking if he could stop the flirting. He agreed and for a couple of weeks everything was fine, but then he started up again with the flirty comments. 

This time, it was way too much and some of them were borderline creepy. Most of the time when he said something flirty it was part of a broader conversation so I just ignored it and hoped he would take the hint. In hindsight, I know I should have just shut it down again each time but I was 19 and I didn't want to lose my drama group friends. He messaged while we were on a group FaceTime to tell me he liked the way my top cut off because of ""what it shows off"", and wished I would lift my arms up (I was wearing a crop top). 

After that, I distanced myself which of course he noticed and brought up. I sent him a huge paragraph telling him he was one of my best friends, that while I liked him at the beginning of lockdown, I only saw him as a friend and it had all been too much. I told him that when he'd continued flirting even after I'd asked him to stop, I distanced myself so that I didn't lead him on. He asked if things would be different in person, and I told him I just wanted to be friends. 

He asked for some space, and when he got back in touch, things were much better. We spoke less and when we did it was just about life, covid, and the virtual shows we were doing. This whole thing took place between mid-March and June.  
When we went back to uni that October, Covid was still in full swing and each college/accommodation had its own rules. Daniel and I were in another virtual show together, but other than that we had kind of drifted apart. We planned on going for a walk to catch up (literally the only thing you could do for a social life) but life got in the way. 

In November, I started dating Max, (now my fiance) and never looked back. Daniel had also started dating another member of the drama group, so the situation over the summer really seemed to be a distant memory for both of us. 

All this to say that in our entire five-year friendship, anything romantic had been shut down early on. 

Over the last five years, Daniel and I have met up maybe once or twice a year, and would message occasionally. I don't know if this is a universal thing, but he was one of those friends you reply to like every month and then they take a month to reply back. 

When we did meet up, we would go for a walk or out for lunch and catch up on each others' lives. He knew all about Max: our plans to move in together, him moving to my home town, our holidays, us buying our first home last year. (I'm only saying this to highlight that he knew how serious we were) Likewise, he told me all about his dating life, how happy he was in London and all his future plans. 

Max proposed in January with my favourite colour party ring and a bunch of red roses. It was perfect. 

That weekend I was meeting up with Daniel for lunch. I met him at his house for a coffee first and when he asked what was new with me, I excitedly showed him my ring. His face immediately fell and he just said nothing. 

Now, in hindsight, obviously I know why, but when I say I had no clue what could possibly be wrong, I genuinely mean it. It was really awkward and after about 10 seconds I asked if he was okay and he said yes. I just assumed maybe something had happened for him and it was a sensitive topic.  I changed the conversation and things seemed to smooth over. 

We went out for lunch and everything was normal. On the way home, I asked him whether he was seeing anyone and that's when he came out with it. 

He told me that he'd been in love with me for the last five years, and while he'd dated people in the past, none of them were me. He said he had always imagined his future with me, and each time we met he was going to tell me but never did. 

Honestly, I was glad he told me and was able to get it off his chest. I know he would have regretted it if he never got to say how he felt. However, it then escalated and I feel like it crossed a line and I've been trying to put into words how it all made me feel ever since. 

I said I was glad he told me because I wouldn't want it weighing on him and that the perfect person was out there for him. He said he knew I would be engaged soon, he just hoped that he would get to confess before it happened, and he felt like he'd missed his chance. Maybe I'm really naive, but there had been no signs of anything for nearly five years and we barely ever saw each other. I also feel like he missed his chance when Max and I got together, not when we got engaged. 

He said if he only he'd taken me on that walk, it could have been him. That he had planned his future with me and only me. He didn't understand Max and I together etc. He then looked me straight in the eyes and told me he loved me. I just gave him a hug and said he would always be a good friend. He held on when I tried to pull away and buried his face in my neck, which made me quite uncomfortable. Daniel's whole confession lasted about 45 minutes, and after this hug, he seemed to take a deep breath (literally like that scene in love actually where he says enough now) and asked if I would come in for a cup of tea.  
I know I should have said no. The people pleaser in me was determined not to leave on a bad/awkward note, so I said just for 15 minutes as I needed to get back to Max. 

We walked back into his house and he looked at me and said: ""All this was meant to be yours."" 

I don't know why, but the way he said it was so unsettling.

I just stood there in silence for a second before he said ""anyway"", and went to put the kettle on. 

It seemed like now it was all in the open, there was just a different side to him. I turned the conversation to our uni drama friends, and he admitted to watching the virtual shows we did together a lot and listening to ""just my favourite songs"" from a uni musical cast recording I was on. The way he said it was just so creepy. 

I left feeling a mix of sad, guilty and weirded out. He gave me another hug goodbye which was similarly too long and I drove home. 

Three days later, Daniel sent me a message saying he would like to call to talk about something and that it wouldn't take long. 

Max and my mum thought he must be calling to ask for some space or to apologise for the inappropriate comments, but I just felt it in my gut. 

I asked Max to sit next to me while I called Daniel. He began the call with ""I've been thinking about what you said the other day about being glad to get it off my chest, and I have some more to say."" 

He'd made some notes and wanted to go through them. The way he said it felt like I was a child being scolded. 

He told me he'd loved me since he met me, and he planned his future with me and no one else. He thinks about me all the time and I'm the only one that makes him feel like himself. He said if I thought I'd be happy with Max then fair enough but that he wanted to be the one to make me happy. He told me I was the one and asked if there was a chance for us and if I could see a future with him.

  
He then said I could have some time to think about it. I told him I didn't need any time, and that I was engaged to Max, in love with Max and that he was my person. 

He said ""oh, alright. I'm going to need to think about that."" 

I said to take as much space as he needs. I hoped we would be able to be friends again one day, but I understand if not.

He said he didn't think we could be friends again, and he couldn't put himself in that situation when us being together wasn't an option. Essentially he made it very clear that to him our friendship was conditional on it becoming a relationship.

We wished each other the best and ended the call. 

Honestly, I have tried blocking this conversation from my mind, but those are the key points I can remember. 

This should be the end of it, but ever since the phone call I've felt really gross and icky. Not only have I lost a friend, it seems he was never one in the first place and he was just playing the long game with me. Every time we went to see a musical together or for lunch he saw it as a date. This probably sounds dramatic but I feel like I'm not even myself to him, just an idea that he felt entitled because it was the future he had imagined. I told him no and that we were just friends when he confessed to me, but clearly that meant nothing because that wasn't the answer that he wanted. Surely, if he genuinely wanted me to be happy, he wouldn't have made that self-indulgent phone call telling me off for wanting to be with my fiance. It's hard to put into words but I feel really demeaned, disrespected, small, and kind of used. Not to mention how disrespectful it is of Max and our relationship. Yet the way the conversation was left is that I let him down, and I'm responsible for the end of our friendship. My friend summed it up the other day when she said he's going to go away from it thinking ""the nice guys always finish last"", that it's my loss and that what he did was appropriate. 

  
I've been weighing up in my mind about sending him a message, telling him how that phone call and the comment about the house made me feel. I don't know what it will achieve other than let me feel like I actually had a voice in this whole thing because so far it feels like I've been a prop in his rom com. At the same time, I know I get to come home to Max and I don't want to kick Daniel while he's down. I'd really appreciate any thoughts or advice. Sorry for the long post!

1imcgdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teambuilding/comments/1imcgdp/why_team_rituals_are_important/,Why Team Rituals are Important,"When we think about team-building, we often focus on the skills and communication aspect. But there’s another, less obvious thing that can transform a group of individuals into a cohesive team: rituals. Team rituals might seem trivial, but they have a big impact on culture and the long-term success of the team.

Rituals create a sense of belonging. That could be a weekly stand-up meeting, a celebratory lunch for completed projects, or even just a quick morning check-in. Humans love establish patterns, and rituals help with the rhythm and structure in team dynamics. These practices become shared experiences that reinforce the idea that everyone is part of a unit rather than just working for themselves. For remote or hybrid teams, virtual coffee breaks or end-of-week wins meetings can bridge the physical distance and keep connections strong. For in person, there’s no shortage of ideas that you can enact regularly in your office (though you can leave a comment if you currently have rituals that work well for you). 

One of the key benefits of team rituals is consistency. They provide a sense of stability. Knowing there’s always a space to connect, share, or unwind gives team members something to rely on, and this is especially true during hectic periods (I’m looking at you Q4 companies haha). This reliability doesn’t just boost morale, but it also strengthens trust. When people know they can count on certain moments to come together, they’re more likely to feel secure and supported.

Rituals also create opportunities for celebration and recognition. We understand that your work is not your family, but it is a group of humans that you spend a significant amount of time with - so celebrate them! A regular practice of recognizing individual and team achievements, whether through shoutouts, awards, or simple thank-yous, keeps motivation high and reminds everyone that their contributions matter.

Another advantage of team rituals is their ability to reinforce values and culture. For example, a team that prioritizes collaboration might establish a ritual of starting meetings with what they need help or assistance with, or where they’re at in their projects. A team focused on innovation might hold brainstorming sessions. By aligning rituals with your team’s goals and principles, you create a living reminder of what matters most.

The best rituals are authentic and meaningful to the team. Maybe it’s a team joke that becomes a tradition, or a spontaneous moment that turns into something that regularly happens. The key is to not force rituals for the sake of forcing them, but to intentionally choose those that align with your companies’ overall goals. Over time, these shared practices will become a sort of glue that holds your team together.",2,1739210484.0,Teambuilding,1,1.0,False

“My son,” Father said, beaming on television, “who inherited my superpowers.”

Cut to footage of a boy with a shock of blonde hair, clad in a skintight silver-blue suit. He screwed his eyes shut and clenched his fists, and the outline of his body grew hazy, as if he were being blurred in a paint program. Suddenly, the hazy mass shot across the screen, so fast that the camera couldn’t keep up. When it found him again, he was standing fifty feet away.

Next was Hypno Sis, with her poisonously soothing voice that slithered into your soul. Her super name was chosen in a magazine contest. In front of millions, Father read out the winning name, chuckled, and drew her in for a hug. That evening, we heard him shouting at her through the walls, about her “joke of a name.”

Then there were the rest of us. We didn’t have names, because we didn’t have powers. Yet. I was the oldest, so Father often called me into his office, to sort his papers or refill his coffee. I’d hear him muttering to himself.

“Boring. Overdone. Oh, maybe…”

I dreaded the “Maybe”s. After one of them, Father would look up at me and smile, the corners of his eyes crinkling.

“Child,” he’d say, “bring one of your siblings to the lab in an hour.”

For the first few times after we watched Hypno Sis’s broadcast, my siblings were excited, shouting over one another in their eagerness to be chosen, to be made super.

But, time after time, we all heard the screaming. We all saw that no one came back.

Yesterday, Father mused, “Maybe, superheroes need…”

When my siblings saw me, they backed away, pressing their backs to the far wall like they wished to melt into it. My heart broke.

An hour later, I entered the lab to a frown from Father.

“Child,” he said, “why are you alone?”

I took a shaky breath. “Today,” I said, “I brought myself.”

He shrugged and led me around the corner to the back of the lab. I braced myself for horrors, but there was only a steel table. On it was a glass half-filled with clear liquid.

“Drink,” he said, so I did.

Fire coursed through my veins. I screamed, but even as I did so, something in my mind shifted. It was like there was a chest of drawers at the back of my head, and some of the drawers were being slammed shut. The pain was gone. The worry for my siblings that had weighed me down lifted. I felt fantastic.

Other drawers were wrenched open. It wasn’t fair that I had been denied this for so long. My remaining siblings didn’t even appreciate the opportunity in front of them. Cowards. Ingrates.

Father pressed a knife into my hand. As my fingers closed around the handle, the blade glowed white-hot.

“Inferna, my child,” he said, “you will be what superheroes need.

Let me know anything else I should add! 

Things to remember when seeing (ex) 


SILENCE is your friend. 

Don’t cry 

Does he ever mention any attribute of yours that he misses ? 

Don’t say something if you are on the fence about saying it. 

Get back your power dignity by showing he means nothing to you. 

He needs to feel the loss of you. Do not let him know how much you miss him. He lost you. 

He will never be there when I really need him because I did and he wasnt there. 

You cannot be with someone that dims your sparkle so much. 

Your sex life is none of his business, who you are dating is none of his business - you can tell him about your accomplishments but try to keep it there and how you are moving on. 

I had no place in loving him as much as I did, I wasn’t his to love. 

He caved into his fear of being alone knowing how much it would kill my soul.

Immediately we hit it off and she agreed to date within 2 days of texting. That's typically how I like to do dating apps and then find out in person of we are compatible. 

On our first date, we met at a place where we play board games and have a bar. I brought drinks and ice cream for us. The total was $50 overall due to us going to a pretty upscale bar and ice cream palor. I believe men should pay for first dates but what strike me though she never even attempted to reach for her purse. 

On a second date, we went to a upscale coffee shop. So the average drink was $15 dollars and afterwards we went to a sushi restaurant. Again she didn't even try to reach for her purse. So at this point and felling wierd spending money on her. She kept her distance from me and went didn't sit close at all. I had to keep flirting like complimenting her and touching. She never did it back. So at this point, I am suspicious. We got deep on the date and she admitted she never looked at my pictures just my bio. Then she only talks about herself and her teaching career. 

Another huge red flag is that she lied about smoking and she had a promiscuous past. Finally she admitted that she doesn't believe in paying for dates all. She is traditional and expects me for the rest of time to pay for everything. Lowkey I felt offended because we haven't even kiss or slept together and she pretty much drinking me dry. 

The only up side is that she is submissive. So she doesn't try to lead on dates nor does she seem resistant to any advancement. She even said if we dated she would cook and clean for me. And she likes being told what to do. She just wants princess treatment. According to her, she is just shy. She does text me good morning every day and trys to keep the convo going on dates and text. Personally I don't want a sex slave if she would even sleep with me. Plus I do value independence so I probably going to move on. Also I think she using me for a good time until she finds a guy she truly wants. 

I dont have alot of experience with women so I don't know if I am onto something here. But it just feels wrong. I believe men should pay but I feel like her boss and employee

The design is visually pleasing, combining a modern touch with practicality. Its stainless steel finish resists fingerprints, which is a relief because, honestly, my kitchen is a magnet for smudges. The clear lid is a thoughtful addition, allowing me to monitor the grind size without interruptions. That said, while the grinder feels durable, the plastic lid might require gentle handling—it doesn’t feel as sturdy as the rest of the unit.

Speaking of performance, I tested this grinder on a variety of coffee beans, from medium roast to dark roast, and the results were consistent for drip coffee and French press. However, for espresso, I noticed some inconsistency in the grind size. It’s a blade grinder, after all, which naturally lacks the precision of burr grinders. Still, for its price range, the grinding efficiency is commendable.

The one-touch operation is straightforward, making it easy even for my tech-averse uncle to use. Adjusting the grind size is a bit of trial and error; you have to pulse the machine to achieve the desired texture. While this isn’t a dealbreaker, I’d appreciate predefined settings for grind sizes—something that would make the grinder more beginner-friendly. The included cleaning brush is a lifesaver, especially since cleaning blade grinders can be a bit of a chore.

A significant highlight for me is its versatility. Beyond coffee, I’ve used it to grind spices like cumin and cinnamon, as well as nuts for baking. While it handles soft items well, harder ingredients like avocado seeds tend to get tossed around rather than ground effectively, as noted by another user.

**Pros**

* Compact and lightweight design makes it easy to store.
* Stainless steel finish resists smudges and fingerprints.
* Versatile use for coffee, spices, and herbs.
* Simple one-touch operation with a clear lid for monitoring.
* Includes a cleaning brush for hassle-free maintenance.

**Cons**

* Inconsistent grind size for espresso or finer grinds.
* Noisy operation, which might be bothersome in quiet mornings.
* Plastic lid feels less durable compared to the rest of the unit.
* Limited capacity; suitable for small batches only.
* Requires manual pulsing to adjust grind size.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Comparing it to burr grinders in a similar price range, the Kaffe KF2020B falls short in terms of grind consistency. Burr grinders, like the Krups Precision Grinder, offer more uniform particle sizes, especially for espresso. However, they are often bulkier and less versatile when it comes to grinding spices and nuts. In contrast, the Hamilton Beach Fresh Grind is another blade grinder that’s slightly quieter but lacks the same sleek design and stainless steel build quality of the Kaffe. If aesthetics and multi-use capabilities are priorities, Kaffe has the edge.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Considering the price point, this grinder offers decent value for casual coffee drinkers or those venturing into grinding their beans for the first time. It’s not designed for coffee connoisseurs who demand absolute precision, but it’s a practical and affordable option for everyday use. Plus, the lifetime manufacturer’s warranty adds peace of mind, especially if you’re concerned about durability.

In terms of features, the grinder's safety mechanism ensures it doesn’t operate unless the lid is securely in place—a small yet crucial detail that sets it apart from some competitors. The power output is sufficient for its compact size, but don’t expect it to handle industrial-level grinding.

While this grinder isn’t without its shortcomings, it’s a solid choice for an entry-level product that balances affordability with functionality. Its ability to handle both coffee beans and other kitchen ingredients makes it a versatile addition to any home.

So at my local coffee shop there is a barista(M) that I really like. I'm a regular there and come in about 5 times a week. We've chatted casually. A few months ago, I finally gained enough courage to give him my number. I wanted to make sure I didn't make him uncomfortable in any way and did it in the most low pressure way I could think of. I ordered a drink to go, and as he handed it to me I said ""And I also wanted to give you this"". It was as sticky note saying something along the lines of ""Hey, I think you're cute and you seem really nice, I'd love to hang out sometime! Here's my number. If not, no worries! Have a great day:)"". I gave it to him, said have a good day, and left.

That was around 2 months or so ago and never heard anything back. I continued going into the coffee shop and he has never once said anything about it. He's not been awkward or anything, and has continued talking to me as usual. It's like I didn't even give him my number.

  
I don't have any experience in dating, and this was the first time I had done something like this. Is this a normal reaction? To not say anything, not even a ""Hey, I appreciate you giving me your number but I'm not interested"". This would have been fine btw.

It's just driving me crazy thinking that maybe he didn't read it and thought I was just giving him something to throw away, or didn't know if it was intended for him. Maybe I'm thinking too much about this lol.

Sorry if the title is confusing. Let me elaborate. 

I’ve always been “small”. My ED started around 5 yrs old (AN) & I stopped growing age 10 so I’ve been under 5ft forever. I’m in my 30s now. I’ve generally always been towards the lower range of weight for my size.

I’ve had AN and bulimia and flip flop between the 2, whichever helps maintain my weight (loss). Even when I was a nurse and working out in the gym 2 times a day, my TDEE was only ever >!1500 cal!< 

It’s so hard to eat like a “normal” or “regular” person like this. Most normal sized people can have >!2000+ cal!< as their maintenance and lose weight. I can only eat baby foods, cucumbers, salads, and rice cakes. I can’t go out to eat because 1 meal would send me over my limit for the day. 

So I feel like I have no choice but to have an ED. If I wanted to enjoy some cake or a sugary coffee or a handful of chips I’d have to either not eat anything else, workout for 3 hours, or participate in ED behavior. 

I hate being so damn small. The worst is the comments. “No wonder you’re so small if that’s all you eat!” This is all I can eat because I’m so small. “Just eat healthy and exercise!” I worked out for 2.5 hrs yesterday and sweated my arse off. I burned >!700 cal!< all day! That’s one regular meal for most people.

\*\*\*

By this point, Tommy had begun searching the hotel room. The atmosphere was gloomy and claustrophobic, with a scratchy looking bed positioned in the center of the room between two reddish end tables. The bed was aimed at a dresser that had a blank tv, along with two old paintings set on the wall beside it. Like the others in the hotel, these were dated portraits of people dressed in renaissance era clothing, set on a faded backdrop. They were no less ominous than the others, with eyes that seemed to wander. I felt a growing weariness with each second that passed.

“What are you looking for?” I said, leering at Tommy from the entryway.

“Supplies or another way out,” he replied, peering under the bed. “Take a look in that dresser. See if you can find anything. I’m gonna check out the bathroom.”

I hesitated for a moment, wary of any more unwelcome surprise, before letting out a big sigh and traipsing over to the dresser. I rummaged around the surface of the dresser and found a remote to the tv, along with some paper coffee cups and an ice bucket. None of these seemed useful, so I reached for the handle on the top drawer. As I started pulling it open, the eyes of the painting seemed to burn down at me. Then the tv turned on to white static. I looked up; the people in the paintings were now grinning at me with wide eyes and wicked teeth. In the background I heard Tommy yelling “Jeff! Get in here!”

I slammed the drawer shut, causing the tv to go black, and the paintings to return to normal. Horribly shaken, I scurried over to Tommy. He was peering behind a shower curtain in the brightly lit bathroom.

“We gotta get out of here,” I trembled, looking over my shoulder into the dark room. “You won’t believe it, those paintings in there. . .” I stammered.

“We’re in luck!” he said, stepping away from the curtain. I looked at him suspiciously, pausing for a moment before walking slowly towards the shower. As I peered behind the curtain, I saw a white tiled hallway that trailed a short way down to a rounded turn, with soft light shining in from the other side. I could hear gently flowing water, too, echoing from down the tunnel.

“Let’s go.” Tommy said from behind me. I hesitated for a moment and looked over my shoulder at him; a pale face peering at us from a dim corner in the hotel room vanished before I could even tell Tommy. He looked at my wide eyes and spun around before looking back at me confused.

“What? What did you see?” he said, shaking his head.

“Nothing; let’s just get the hell out of here.” I said, turning to scurry into the tiled hallway. Tommy followed close behind. I never needed to visit The Terror Hotel again.

  
*Chapter 7*

**The Pool Rooms**

As we rounded the corner, the floor dipped down a short ways into a few inches of gently undulating turquoise water, leading off further into the tiled hall. Knowing there was no turning back, I took a careful step down into the water. It was lukewarm, and soaked through my boots, but was actually quite soothing. Our careful steps caused echoing splashes in the water that seemed to reverberate for miles down into what I imagined was a huge complex of corridors. The hallway we were in was wide, and quickly met a junction of interconnected rooms, all made up of the same white tile. The architecture was varied but connected, blending seamlessly into one another as one uniform space.

“Which way?” I said, coming to stop.

“Follow your gut.” Tommy answered, waiting patiently for me to make a choice. I looked around at the different rooms that all lead off into well-lit areas and could not help the feeling of Deja-vu. The geometry of the walls and ceiling were like nothing I had ever seen, but the feeling was inescapable. This place looked like the hallway between a locker room and indoor pool, but was so expansive and strangely designed that it had to be out of a dream.

“This way, I guess.” I said, nodding towards a room that appeared to have a large opening around the corner. The floor led up out of the water to tiled stairs and brought us to a bridge that ran alongside a small pool. The ceiling here was high and curved down to the water, but I thought this couldn’t be the main destination for the level.

“Have you ever seen anything like this before?” I asked as we walked alongside the lightly rippling water.

“Never.” Tommy answered in an awed voice. “It’s like pools from a dreamscape.”

The path along the water led us to another medium sized room that had a large, cylindrical support protruding from a shallow pool in the center that reached up to a tall, arched ceiling. The tiled path bent around it past three frosted, trapezial windows that illuminated the area with a mellow, white light before ending at a dark doorway on the far wall. Curious, I walked over to the windows to peer through to the other side, but they were completely opaque, only letting in the light. There were no silhouettes, shapes, or blotches of color behind them, just a uniform glow of soft light.

“What do you think is back there? Should we try to break through?” I said, looking over at Tommy.

“I wouldn’t.” he replied, shaking his head. “Let’s keep moving; this place is interesting.”

I nodded in agreement, and then led us into the next dark doorway. It took us through a narrow tunnel of dimly lit, echoing, rounded hallways, before dipping down into a small, short-ceilinged room. In the center sat a spiral staircase, seamlessly connected to the white tile of the floor. As I walked to the edge to investigate, I noticed that the stairs went down into water, as if they lead to a formerly accessible section that was now flooded.

“Looks like a dead-end.” Tommy said. “I’m not interested in going diving.”

“Me neither.” I replied, growing uneasy as I gazed at the submerged stairs that disappeared into darkness. We followed the tunnel back past the room with the tall cylindrical support and then into a series of interconnected rooms. They were all made up of the same strange, tiled geometry and polygonal pools. Large, crescent indentations in the walls and perfectly symmetrical overhangs in the ceiling made each room feel unique but connected so cohesively that the design appeared intentional. There was no rhyme or reason to any of it, though; support pillars were placed oddly, rooms varied in height, length, and design, with irregular angles of light casting gradients over the architecture. I struggled to find a purpose for any of it; why was this here? Everything was so pristine, too, the tile, turquoise water, and design. Who designed this, and to what end?

The path we had taken was leading us deeper into the level now. We had passed at least a half-dozen more junctions, and I was just following my instincts, mostly mesmerized by the surreal architecture that continued to stir feelings of strange nostalgia and liminal peculiarity. The rooms seemed to grow in complexity as we wandered deeper, too. Circular indentations high up on the walls merged with the dizzying spans of flawless tile. Not one square was out of place. Each tile blended into the warps and curves of the ceilings and walls, as if laser cut and robotically placed. The fact that we had seen a stairwell going down also gave me feelings of uneasy curiosity; how big was the area beneath us, and was it entirely flooded? Was there an upper area too? How big was this place?

Although unnerving, this level gave me far less dread than the ones before. I had no idea if there would be a savage entity around the next corner, but the sound of trickling water and patches of warmth soothed me. It was like an endless bath house of divine architecture and softly illuminated rooms, leading. . .where? Where was the center; the singularity? It really felt like it was taking us *somewhere*; to some large pool or a grand entry to the complex, but the rooms just continued, almost as if they were generated. Perhaps that’s what it was; a mathematical equation, with variables that ensure irregularity but always end in perfection. A network of complexly uniform rooms, all eerily fused into one master design that produced an endless journey with no destination.

We had reached the entrance to a particularly unique area when Tommy told me to stop.

“I’ve never been to a level like this before.” Tommy said hesitantly. “I say we find a place to rest.”

Ahead of us was a long, rectangular path, leading into a vast expanse of large, ogee arches that touched from ceiling to floor. A foot or so of standing, navy-blue water reached up the feet of the arches, spanning the whole area. The rectangular path stretched further than I could see, with evenly branched paths off of it between each line of parallel arches. This section was dimly lit, obscuring areas further off in the expanse.

“I don’t think we can’t stop here,” I said matter-of-factly. “We might as well keep going until we find somewhere dry.”

“Yeah. I’m just tired, and I don’t know if it’s safe to sleep in this level.” Tommy said, stepping in the room to look around. “I’m also getting low on almond water. Seems like the sanity drain is low here, but we’re going to need more soon.”

“How do we go about finding more?” I said, wading through the warm water. Tommy was now following close behind, immersed in the repeating architecture.

“Crates, cabinets, lockers; those sorts of things. Haven’t seen any here, though.” Tommy replied. He was looking side to side at the paths on both sides through the arches that seemed to stretch into oblivion.

“This thing is a labyrinth. Don’t get us lost.” Tommy warned.

“I figure we just stay on this main path; see where it takes us.” I reassured, glancing over my shoulder at the brightly lit doorway we had come in from. I could not see any edges of the room; just endless tiled arches disappearing into the abyss. Perhaps this was the main attraction; a vast, shallow underground pool, like some kind of sensory deprivation tank in the subterranean aquifer of the level. I wondered if we would just hit the perimeter at some point and see this was a dead end, forcing us to backtrack. If there was a perimeter, it was huge; we had already walked a straight half mile down the middle path. The low ceiling, along with the arches and shallow water, made it feel like we were in some sort of subterranean drainage area, like something under a massive bridge or city sewer. It was too immaculate to be a sewer, though; more like an underground spring that was converted to a man-made cave. This was the kind of place you end up after swimming through a secret underground tunnel in a hotel pool.

By now, the light of the entry was long gone; all we could see in any direction was the evenly submerged architecture and flat ceiling stretching into darkness. The splashes of our steps echoed through the expanse, alongside the gently undulating water; I dreaded what hearing anything other than that meant.

“How far. . .do you think this goes?” I said hesitantly. Tommy didn’t reply, so I looked over my shoulder and began to ask again. He wasn’t there. I looked in every direction, searching frantically. He was nowhere to be found in the infinite halls.

“Tommy!” My voice echoed far off into the expanse; into areas I had not been. I cried out for him again, desperate for a reply. Nothing; just the sound of my voice, fading into the void. Had I left him behind? Why wouldn’t he have said something? I had to find him, so I ran back. My feet thrashed through the water, soaking my pants as I ran through the sprays. It was exhausting, but I pressed on, back towards. . .where? Where was I going? I had lost my direction. I couldn’t tell where I had come from; it all looked the same; an endless maze of arches. I fell to my knees; the lukewarm water soaked up my shirt. I was completely lost.

What now? Wait here for Tommy? When had I even lost him? How would I find him? I had already called out to him, over and over, but he was gone. Maybe he had tired out and I just didn’t notice. Why here of all places? It wasn’t fair; I was completely alone.

“Tommy.” I said disparagingly before screaming “What do I do now!”

The unfeeling expanse stood still. It did not warp or change because of my loss, being nothing other than entirely indifferent. It was dead space; a callous surrounding that was completely detached from anything happening to me. It felt darker now; no longer bringing about feelings of sublimity and frightened awe. This was just a desolate, liminal abyss now, cut off from the rest of the world. Home, and my life before, felt so far away. I was unfathomably deep in some kind of wormhole; a transitional space; a purgatory that was unimaginably large. It was the place between “here” and “there” that I wasn’t supposed to see. Not just this vast expanse of perfectly tiled pool rooms either; the whole “Back Rooms” felt this way: a series of environments that were familiar, but so expansive and lacking any identifiable purpose that the only explanation was a glitch in reality. It all felt as if I had taken a wrong turn in a department store, hotel, or locker room, and wound up on a path that appeared to lead somewhere, but in fact, went nowhere, only leading further into itself.

But what was “it.” I was still trying to figure that out. The only place I had ever been like this was in a dream, where, while inside my house, I tried going to my garage. The familiar path from my bedroom to the garage was different though. Instead of finding the usual white hallway, with family pictures and pieces of furniture, I wound up in a far larger area. It had tall ceilings and strange architecture, but was made up of the same colors and aesthetic of my house. How had I never seen this part of my home, I thought, and where would it take me? This place stretched for forever; how had I never seen this part of my house? Indeed, these “Back Rooms” were the physical manifestation of a dream scape, created solely by the mind expanding on what it has formerly seen.

I knew of spaces in “the real world” that were not so dissimilar to these sorts of uncanny environments; I had worked in them plenty of times. Perhaps it was the human element of these liminal places that gave them such an eerie vibe. They were not alien or supernatural; instead, they were made of all familiar architecture and design that appeared to have been used at some point, but had been long forgotten. Now it stood just as an empty, abandoned space, waiting for. . .what?

I was back walking again at this point, despairing but faced with no other choice but to press on. I still couldn’t wrap my head around what was going on. What Tommy had told me about us having wound up in a liminal wormhole seemed irrefutable now. I had no doubt that I was somewhere outside of reality, albeit in a less common way. The Sci-fi movies I had watched never seemed to put the characters in a place like this. It was always some sort of surreal biome, a distant planet, or a fairy land tucked behind a wardrobe, not an endless series of liminal corridors. I mean, maybe in some horror films and purgatorial scenes there were similarities, but those places were never the point of the movie. They were quite literally transitional; relevant to the storyline in some way, but what was the story here? Get out? Was that all this place was; somewhere to be left far behind? And then what would become of it? Would it simply go on existing as this vast, strange, seemingly pointless space, frozen in time?

The thought of leaving it all behind as a distant memory was appealing, but unsettling at the same time. Of course, I desperately wanted out, but this place's very existence was haunting. What would it be like to go on living, knowing all the while that somewhere between the grooves of reality lies a network of bizarre, isolated corridors that wind endlessly through. . .what? What even was “outside?” A large concrete plain with a gargantuan complex built atop it, or just some kind of void? I didn’t know if I could even trust a natural setting if I found it; where was the line between “here” and “there?” If there was the sun, trees, and sky, but I was still technically in “The Back Rooms,” then how in the hell would I know I was home? Would I ever even trust my surroundings again?

The echoing splashes of my footsteps grew faint as I wandered through the repeating arches. My senses were dulled by the infinite, symmetrical expanse and warm water, which lulled me into trance. I wondered if I might be going insane, but I didn’t feel the same as when I had been in the hotel ballroom. I was much more numb and detached, just wandering, unsure if I would ever make it out of here. I suppose this was not the worst way to die; I would eventually just lie down quietly in the water and drift off, forever lost in this subterranean pool. No one would ever find me, and I would never get to know where I truly was.

Just as I had begun to give up hope, a change in the surface of the water caught my attention. It was rippling, glazed with a stream of golden-white light. I followed the light, which took me through an array of arches where, set perfectly in the center of them, a spiral staircase. It led up into the ceiling, illuminated by light shining from above, like a holy beacon. As I approached it, I did not feel the hope or relief I had experienced with the other “exits.” I was not anxious or excited. All I felt was a muted apathy. Before I started to climb up, I took one last look out at the liminal aquifer; I was leaving Tommy here, along with a part of me. Something had changed; I wasn’t scared anymore. There was only forward; no more trying to get out of this. Maybe Tommy had found a different way out, or maybe he would wander down here forever, but as for me, I had to go.

The staircase led up a half dozen turns, bringing me closer to the bright light. I was curious but hesitant; though I had been alone for what felt like hours, the environment hadn’t changed until now. There was a strange comfort in oblivion, and I knew this place was definitely not the boiler room that we were supposed to find in the hotel. I was no closer to the exit; for all I knew, I was still days or weeks away from ever getting out.

The stairs lead me up to a room that was large and rectangular, with a very high ceiling and skywalks, almost like some sort of Olympic pool room. Shallow canals of water branched through walkways in the floor, leading to drainage areas low on the walls, while the skywalk above led to dark openings that caught my attention. I could not help but wonder where they went, but the path to get up there was unclear. The lower level had at least five different routes, but I figured “up” was the only real sense of direction I had. Maybe I could reach the top of the structure and find a way out; what was above this place?

I followed a walkway across the water and then into a round ceilinged hall that I thought might take me up. Instead, it stopped in a medium-sized room with a polygonal pool in the center that occupied most of the floor space. The water gleamed with champagne light from a wide, trapezoid window, centered on the wall next to the pool. It was frosted and completely opaque, and seemed to shine brighter on a small, triangular peninsula of cream-colored tile. The whole floor was almost completely level with the water, where even a small wave would wash over it, but the sublimity of the space was unmistakable, like a summer day by the pool.

Whether it was my declining sanity or exhaustion and exceptional weariness from wandering for God knows how long, I wanted to lie down. My last “rest” had been in the office, back when I had first met up with Tommy. . . I hadn’t even really thought about him being gone yet; the environment had lulled me too much. Him being gone was. . .horrible. I had lost my only companion in this terrible place and couldn’t help but feel guilty. He had saved me more times than I could count, and I just left him. The thought of him down there alone, wandering endlessly, abandoned, wondering where his friend went; I couldn’t take it. What had I done? He was the only one here who cared about me.

I paced over to the peninsula and sat down, overcome with grief. To be alone here was miserable, and though it had started out like that, having Tommy, only to lose him hours later, made the loneliness that much worse. Going back and looking for him just seemed like a futile way of coping with the reality that he was gone; I knew there was no hope in finding him down there. I had wandered miles trying to find him, and the choice to take the stairs was not out of selfishness, but survival. That said, if he *did* find his way up, I should be visible. That’s what I would do, rest at the top of the stairs.

As I stood up to leave the poolside, a scrap of paper slipped out of my pocket down by the water’s edge. I looked at it curiously, having no recollection of its presence in my pocket, before swiping it up. It was a note, but not one I had written.

  
*Jeff,*

*I don’t know when or where you’ll find this, but I’m guessing when you do, you will want an explanation. After our close encounter with the moth in the hotel, I wrote this note to warn you that there is a chance that The Back Rooms will separate us. While getting lost is always a possibility, being separated by this places' nonlinear physical properties is more likely. There are many unconfirmed links between levels, and I’m guessing one of us found one and ended up no-clipping to a different level.*

*I didn’t tell you about this because I did not want it to scare you. This place feeds on fear, and I knew your sanity would drain quickly with the ever-present threat of being isolated again. Ignorance is bliss, right?*

*Well, the cold truth is that I am not sure if we will ever meet again. I’ve heard of a place called “The Hub” that has doors to every level in The Back Rooms. It’s a hidden level and looks like an underground car tunnel. As far as getting there, if you see a brown, metal door that looks out of place, no matter which level you are on, take it. I don’t know if it will get us any closer to escaping, but it’s the only reliable rendezvous point for getting back together.*

*I hope we make it out, Jeff. I’ll wait for you at the hub as long as I can.*

*Tommy*

  
I stared at the letter in disbelief, and then sighed, looking up at the ceiling. With no clear path out, and levels that now apparently teleported people at random, I could hardly hold on to the hope of getting home. I was quite literally in an unending nightmare, with impossible hurdles at seemingly every turn. Maybe there was no way out of here, and every soul unfortunate enough to come into contact with The Back Rooms was damned. I had nothing anymore; my phone was dead, my partner gone, and my sense of direction completely extinguished. The only thing I had to hold onto was getting to The Hub to see Tommy. I would have to fight total despair to see this thing through; I didn’t want to die. I wasn’t gonna just be another skeleton in liminal hell; I was going to make it out and tell my story.

These pool rooms were, at the very least, the most mellow place I had been in since I started this whole trip, which brought up the question, where exactly was I when this bad dream started? It had to be somewhere behind that first locked door; somewhere in Caius; the place where the fabric of reality ripped, and I fell in. This couldn’t be some kind of outrageous government experiment; it was too vast, horrible, and nonsensical to be of any use to politicians. The reality was far stranger than an evil experiment. It was as if I was in a procedurally generated environment from a haywire computer, lost in space that had no ongoing purpose. A forsaken limbo.

The absence of entity sightings and general calm of this gently illuminated peninsula was a mild antidote to my melancholy; I would rest here for the time being. Drink some almond water, try and get some sleep; anything to keep my mind at ease. Sanity was the currency here. It still felt strange to relax in a place so far away and liminal, but, part of me embraced it; a million miles from nowhere, lounged out next to a shallow pool no one even knows exists. It was like I was embracing being forgotten; committed to the void. Tucked away in this tiled labyrinth, far, far away from any other soul. No reason to fight it; just me and infinity. Mortal impermanence.

  
\*\*\*

  
I wasn’t sure how long I slept; it felt like at least six hours, and when I awoke, the sunlight seemed to be coming in through my bedroom window. As I rolled over and opened my eyes, the same, trapezoidal window casting soft, indifferent light across the still water and white tile took shape. The room hadn’t changed at all since I fell asleep; I was still in the middle of a surreal expanse of tiled pool rooms with the echoes of gently undulating water radiating through the endless corridors. Sleep had made me feel better; it was the most normal thing I had done in the last three days, and although lying here was preferable to exploring more, I had to keep moving.

Before leaving, I took a long look around the room that had given me my only real rest in the last 3 days. I held onto the feeling, savoring it; making sure I wouldn’t forget. I wanted to revisit this place in my mind someday, at a time when the crushing weight of the world and mortality was too much. I could think back to here, where there is nothing; back to a pure, enveloping, void who’s inescapably isolating atmosphere was unlike any place I had ever been. It was a break from everything; a nostalgia devoid of subsistence; a dreamlike peculiarity, totally separated from everything else.

My time of respite and reflection had given me a subtle appreciation for this experience, even in spite of the overwhelming horror. Whatever this place was, its novelty and strange effects on the human experience were powerfully unique, and aside from just getting home to safety, deep down, I desperately hoped that I would make it out so that I could unpack this whole thing and tell my story. I had never been to a place so bizarre and anomalous.

My plan was to try and find a way up to the skywalk that lined the perimeter of the tall room I had originally come in on. I traced my way back to that Olympic-pool room, and then took the first path that appeared to go up. It led me through a hall of stilted arches connected to the ceiling, with shallow, warm water reaching up their tiled legs. The hallway then ended at a stainless-steel ladder that I climbed up, taking me into a large chamber that had oval windows high up the left wall. Their grayish-blue light stretched across the tile path towards a large depression in the floor. It dropped at least twenty feet down into a bowl-shaped pool, appearing to have been drained of water. This depression rounded up the wall all the way to the ceiling with a sharp drop off next to the path. There would be no way out if I fell in; the walls were too steep to climb out of.

I stayed along the wall by the windows, wary of getting trapped until someone decided to fill the deep pool again. The walkway led to another room that had a tiled, square staircase leading up, which I followed for a short ways before it plateaued into a corridor that was illuminated by three circular windows. They cast irregular gradients of light along the tiled walls and polygonal pool, giving the room a distinct appearance of being basked in morning sunlight. Then, I noticed a square doorway out onto the skywalk, and immediately scurried past the pool towards it. My stomach churned as I looked down at the three-story drop, but I could see the spiral staircase I had come in from.

The walkway thankfully had a rounded, steel railing at waist height, which I kept my hand on while peering down at the floor below. I tried to push out thoughts of falling as I followed the skywalk along the top of the lengthy room, and couldn’t help but wonder about where all these hallways led to. The corridors of this place seemed to go on for miles, like a million hotel pools from a dream, winding like a maze that had no end. The image of perfectly geometric, tiled pool rooms stretching off into oblivion brought an overwhelming feeling of minimization, as I was an ant faced with crossing a football field. Getting lost was inevitable, and there was so much around me that I couldn’t even perceive.

As I gazed down at the dim, circular opening of the spiral staircase to the aquifer below, I thought of Tommy. Was he still down there, or had he no-clipped to another level? It didn’t really matter now; we were separated, and thinking about just how alone I really was brought a familiar, desolate feeling. I paused, staring out at the tiled expanse; one last look before I went. Forgetting this place was impossible; these bizarre halls and pools would go on existing in this weird purgatorial state forever. I might be leaving, but *they* will not be gone; their very existence would remain as an unnerving reminder to me that, somewhere between the threads of reality, there is a place so peculiar and anomalous; a place of unexplained corridors and rooms, all sharing an unmistakable theme of liminality and the feeling that you’re not supposed to be there. A kind of modern purgatory; this place was not meant for man to see; not meant to explored. It was to be left as is; a space between reality and heaven; the loading zone for matter before it is perceived.",1,1739209221.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

A few hours had passed since the rain ceased, but the monotony outside continued. A strange feeling filled his body. Perhaps it was helplessness, or maybe it was an intense power, but one thing was certain – weakness overwhelmed him. “What is happening to me?” – only he knew the answer.

The morning turned out to be one of those that you wish to experience again and again. The cold filled room after room, but today it felt different. He walked into the kitchen and, for the first time in a week, saw the light, the sunlight breaking through the roller blinds. Perhaps he should open them and let the warmth embrace him, but it felt too good to watch the rays trying to touch him, only to retreat again and again. ""In some way, they are like me,"" he thought briefly. For weeks, he had failed to change anything, but how badly he wanted to… Life was like this ray, which every morning, as if in a loop, breaks into rooms, but always loses.

So basically for the past 6 days I’ve been having a really rough period and having symptoms I have NEVER had before. For the first three days, I had TERRIBLE cramps to the point where I was sobbing and I never get them so this was really hard for me. On top of that I’ve been extremely constipated my entire period so far which again, is extremely odd because I am never constipated. My bleeding is heavy with blood clots, which is normal for me. I’ve tried everything for the constipation like laxative pills, magnesium, massaging my stomach, a lot of water, coffee, castor oil, walking, but nothing is working. My mom said she thinks it might be a cyst but I don’t know anything about that because i’m only 18. I got a doctor’s appointment but I’m coming on here to ask if I should maybe go to the ER? The pain from period cramps + being constipated is really bad and the only thing that helps me is sitting in the bath or a heat pad. 

Some other context: For the entire month of January I didn’t get a period, my appetite is really bad I usually forget to eat a lot because I rarely feel hungry, my sleep is terrible sometimes (especially recently) I wake up at 2 AM after going to sleep at 9 PM.

I have been following the company for close to two decades and haven’t always felt this way. I think now is the time, but I’d genuinely love input and feedback on this!

Over the past two years, the company has focused on evolving from a niche craft soda brand into a diversified beverage company. The pieces are now in place and I believe it will triple revenue (from $20M to 60M) in the next couple of years, becoming a prime acquisition target if it can do so. In that case, they would be a high growth company with strong brand recognition, so I believe they would command a 4x revenue multiple for a 200-250M price. The current market cap is just over 25M, so a 10x play here.  

Here's why I think Jones Soda could pull this off:

**1. The Brand**

Jones Soda has always had a **strong brand identity**, built on its craft, nostalgia-driven marketing, and consumer engagement. Unlike commodity soda brands, Jones commands **premium pricing** and can stand out in an era where consumers want unique, artisanal beverages.

**2. Expanding Beyond Soda: A Beverage Company**

Jones is no longer just a craft soda brand—it’s becoming a **diversified beverage company**:

  
**Mary Jones & Spiked Jones** – The fastest-growing cannabis beverage brand in California, now in WA, MI, MO, and Canada (w/ Tilray) with new states coming. They also just recently began distribution with Anheuser Busch partners to bring their HD9 and Spiked Jones beverage to many more retailers. Jones is set to perform well in these spaces, as many of their brand loyalists from the early 2000s are prime age to consume these categories.

**Pop & Fiesta Jones** – The company recently launched **Pop Jones & Fiesta Jones** each of which tap into the **functional beverage** trend. The category has seen massive demand with brands exploding in valuation. Right off the bat the company scored distribution into 2,000 C-stores, with public hints that many more are in the works. These bring the Jones brand to modern categories.

**Core Soda Modernization** – In addition to a brand facelift that is happening now, the company is FINALLY set to launch it’s core flavors in zero sugar formats, appealing to more sugar-conscious consumers. Personally, while I loved the flavors, I’ve needed this to occur to be a regular consumer and I believe plenty others out there feel the same way.

**3. Financials: Improving Margins**

Jones has spent the last few years **cleaning up its financials**:  
**Margins are improving** – Recent cost optimization and pricing adjustments have started yielding better gross margins, making the company more sustainable long-term.  
**Debt-free balance sheet** – Unlike many small-cap companies, Jones isn’t buried in toxic debt that makes going to $0 much less likely, so the downside is limited and propped up by the strength and value of the brand.  
**Single-serve & Minis** – They have shifted focus to more consumable formats, selling more individuals bottles and cans, which allow for higher margins than twelve packs and have introduced mini cans and other bottling formats to allow for higher velocity.

**4. Leadership and Operations**

**Enhanced Distribution Network** – The company has taken the steps necessary to allow for rapid growth, having partnered with the likes of DOT Foods and others to ensure they can meet customer demands in their growing list of channels.

**New CEO & CFO** – The company hired the former CEO of Black Rifle Coffee, who was there pre-IPO when the company scaled from where Jones is now to where Jones wants to be. Additionally, for the first time in 5+ years, they have a legitimate CFO who can help navigate any future raise, sale, merger, or uplist successfully.

**5. Needs**

**Effective Marketing Campaigns** – The company does need to get its marketing back on track. They have waffled between being in-house and using different agencies the last few years. They need to pick a path and commit to put out clear, engaging content.

**Cost-effective Overhead** – The has operated unprofitably the last few years as it invested heavily in innovating to become a beverage brand instead of just soda. Now is the time to tighten the belt and execute in a lean manner. Rumor has it that the last CEO, while great at brining innovation, was fired because of overspending, and the board prioritized a hire who will focus on operating in a lean, disciplined way financially moving forward.

Again, let me know your honest thoughts. I have put a lot of eggs in this basket. I have attended evert conference call and read every press release over the last few years and believe the company has taken all the background steps needed to now blow up (in a good way). I am sure there are some things I forgot, what else should I consider?",2,1739208471.0,pennystocks,3,1.0,False
1imbm88,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1imbm88/i_was_clinically_dead_for_10_minutes_i_went_to/,"I was clinically dead for 10 minutes. I went to heaven, and what I saw there defied every Sunday school parable, every psalm, every sermon about gates of pearl and streets of gold.","
First, there was the dying.  

The highway unspooled like a strip of charcoal beneath a sickly purple dusk. My hands strangled the steering wheel, still trembling from ten hours in the Amazon warehouse—a cavern of fluorescent hell where conveyor belts rattled like skeletons and managers barked through headset static. My shirt clung to my back, damp with the greasy sweat of exhaustion. Then, the fist.  

It began as a pressure, a slow cinching beneath my ribs, as if an invisible hand were kneading my heart like dough. I rubbed my sternum, fingertips catching on the logo of my polo. The pain sharpened. By the time I veered onto the exit ramp, my breaths came in shallow sips, as though the air had been siphoned from the car. My pulse skittered—*rabbit-fast, rabbit-terrified*—against the cage of my ribs.  

Gravel popped beneath my tires as I lurched into the driveway. The engine coughed into silence. Outside, the neighborhood slept under a sodium-vapor haze, the only sound the *tick-tick-tick* of cooling metal. I staggered out, legs jelly-weak, and the world tilted. The porch steps warped, wood planks stretching like taffy. My shoe caught the edge of the second step.  

For a suspended heartbeat, I floated.  

Then pavement rose—a cold, starless galaxy—to meet me. My elbows shredded on asphalt as I crab-walked backward, sneakers squealing, until the road cradled me. Headlights exploded in my vision. Tires screamed. A sedan halted inches from my skull, close enough to taste the acrid stink of scorched rubber. A woman tumbled out, her face moon-pale under the streetlamp’s jaundiced glow. “Oh God—!” Her voice cracked. “Are you—?”  

She froze.  

My mouth moved, but sound died in my throat.  

My vision swam—her blonde hair smeared into a halo, her Honda’s hazard lights bleeding neon pink and green. The maple tree in my yard multiplied, three trembling copies clawing at a sky now spinning like a carousel. My heart galloped, a feral thing kicking at my ribs. She backpedaled, phone pressed to her ear.

“*Send someone—he’s not breathing!*”  

Sirens warbled in the distance. Time frayed:  
Red and blue strobing lights cutting through shadows; gloved hands; a stretcher’s nylon straps biting into my shoulders; a paramedic’s walkie-talkie spitting jargon: *“VFib… BP 60 over palp… no carotid pulse…”*  

“Stay with us, buddy.” A hand patted my cheek—vinyl glove cold and insistent. The oxygen mask clamped over my face reeked of plastic and desperation. Above me, the ambulance ceiling swam into focus: water-stained tiles; a Rorschach blot of old coffee (or blood?); a dangling penlight swaying like a metronome.

Darkness yawned.

I let it swallow me.

Consciousness returned in shards:  
Blurred ceiling tiles streaked past; wheels clattered beneath the gurney; antiseptic scorched my nostrils; voices spliced through fog.

“—losing pulses—”  

“—charge to 200—”  

A crash cart rattled nearby as ER lights glared—merciless and interrogative—before sputtering into black.

“We’re losing him!”  

The shout pierced through sterile darkness like shattered glass.

Then—

*Nothing.*

A void without temperature or sound or even vibration—the faintest hum of electricity absent from this place.

*This is death*, I thought.

*This is—*

Later they’d explain it clinically: *Ventricular fibrillation,* the cardiologist said while tracing squiggles on an EKG printout: *Chaotic electrical impulses… no blood flow… miraculous you’re here.* 

But in those **10 minutes**, there were no monitors or medical Latin or miracles.

Only the *other place*.  

I woke on my back, spine pressed into a surface that mimicked grass—pliant yet unyielding, like memory foam carved into blades. Above me stretched a sky that defied language. Clouds hung frozen, their edges unnaturally crisp, as if cut from bleached felt and glued to an abyss. The void behind them was not mere darkness but *erasure*, a vacuum that gnawed at the edges of perception, like staring into the static between radio stations. Only the clouds tethered me to reality, their faint bioluminescent glow suggesting some alien photosynthesis, pulsing in slow, arrhythmic waves.

The field stretched infinitely in all directions, a fractal nightmare of uniformity. Each blade of grass was identical—chartreuse at the base, fading to citrine at the tip, precisely three millimeters wide. No soil nestled between them; they sprouted from a seamless mat of dull silver, like AstroTurf woven by machines. When I pressed my palm down, the stems didn’t bend. They resisted like plastic bristles yet emitted a faint organic musk—sweet and cloying, like rotting lilies. The air hung thick, devoid of humidity or temperature, as though the atmosphere itself had been vacuum-sealed.

Time dissolved. Seconds bled into hours. My hand drifted to my chest—no rise, no fall. I clawed at my throat, fingertips sinking into gelatinous flesh that reknit instantly. Panic flared briefly in my mind but dissipated just as quickly; my body remained inert—a marionette with severed strings. When I raised my arm, the non-light of this place seeped through my skin, revealing a lattice of veins like cracked porcelain. My “flesh” was vellum soaked in glycerin; the grass beneath was visible as smudged impressions—a Magic Eye painting gone wrong. I waved a hand. No shadow followed. No proof I existed at all.

A scream tore through my skull—silent and airless—a vacuum-sealed eruption that left no echo in this sterile void. My jaw unhinged grotesquely, tendons straining against their limits, yet no vibration troubled the stagnant air. Fear metastasized in my gut—a tumor with teeth—but my face stayed slack: a wax museum replica of terror.

Movement flickered at the edge of my dead-aquarium vision. Three figures sat lotus-style in the distance, their nudity neither provocative nor obscene—as if gender and modesty had been scrubbed from them entirely. Their skin mirrored mine: semi-opaque with a faint opalescent sheen, like soap bubbles moments before bursting. The oldest (or perhaps merely the most eroded?) rose first, his feet levitating a micron above the grass. Each step left no imprint or whisper of friction; he seemed to traverse a hologram rather than solid ground. Up close, his face resembled a Botticelli angel—flawless symmetry marred only by eyes without lids or lashes and lips that moved a half-second out of sync with his words.

“Don’t worry.” The voice emanated from everywhere—the grass beneath me, the air around me, the inside of my molars. It resonated like a bow dragged across cello strings, vibrating deep in my marrow. “Everyone feels this way at first.”

He gestured toward the others: The woman hugged her knees tightly to her chest; her hair was frozen mid-sway—a cascade of liquid mercury caught in time. The teenage girl plucked at grass blades with fingers that passed through them like mist; her face was a mask of automated boredom. Their bodies flickered faintly as if buffering—edges pixelating like corrupted JPEGs struggling to render fully.

“Come,” the old man intoned softly but firmly. “Sit with us. We’ll answer what we can.”

Terror should have petrified me—but without cortisol or catecholamines coursing through me here in this place where biology had no dominion—fear became nothing more than an abstract concept: theoretical and distant.

I floated forward instead—legs moving with marionette autonomy—and sank cross-legged beside him when commanded to do so. The grass beneath us remained preternaturally stiff: jabbing needle-tip precision into my thighs yet leaving no marks behind.

“You must have many questions.” His voice rumbled through the ground beneath us—a sub-bass growl that vibrated up through my bones until it reached my teeth.

Their eyes pinned me: pupils dilated into black holes surrounded by faintly bioluminescent irises that pulsed faintly like dying embers in milk-glass sockets.

“Where am I?” My voice startled even me when it emerged hollowly—reverberating oddly—as though spoken through an ancient tin-can telephone stretched taut between dimensions.

“You’re in *Anamoní*,” he replied evenly while his lips stretched into something resembling a smile but not quite human enough for comfort—it didn’t crease his marble-smooth face naturally either way.

The name slithered off his tongue like syrup-thick vowels from some archaic dead language resurrected momentarily just long enough for its meaning alone to haunt its listener afterward indefinitely…

I blinked. “So I’m not in heaven?”

“Not yet.” His gesture swept toward the horizon, where the grass fused seamlessly with the anti-sky. “Anamoní is… a purgatory of patience. A sieve.” The others tilted their heads in unison, their necks creaking faintly like unoiled hinges. “We are the residue. The unworthy sediment.”

“Waiting to get into heaven?”

“Yes.” His finger traced the air, painting invisible sigils that dissolved as quickly as they formed. “Sixty-three years for me. Fifty-eight for her.” The woman’s nod was robotic, her hair frozen mid-sway like a suspended waterfall. “Nineteen for the child.” The girl mimed plucking grass, her fingers phasing through blades as static as plastic ferns. “Time here is not time.”

“Why aren’t we *in* heaven?”

He leaned closer, his pupils glowing faintly—twin embers in milk-glass eyes. “The soul must… *molt*. Shed its husk—regret, greed, the rot of living. Until it’s weightless. Pure.” His gaze dropped to my chest. “But yours—yours already *burns*.”

He tapped my sternum with a sound like a dull *thud*, wet clay struck by a fist. “Look.”

I glanced down.

A glow pulsed beneath my wax-paper skin—not the sickly, guttering flicker of the others but a relentless white radiance, as if I’d swallowed a neutron star. The old man recoiled slightly, his own chest dimming like a bulb on a dying circuit.

“You won’t linger here,” he whispered, his voice tinged with venomous envy.

I squinted eastward, where the void blurred into a silver smudge on the horizon. “How do I *leave*?”

“The angel descends for the ready.” The others stiffened at his words, their translucent faces contorting—mouths twitching, eyes narrowing—as if struck by invisible blows. “You’ll see the gate. The rest of us…” His voice frayed and unraveled into silence.

The girl resumed her pantomime, fingers raking through grass that refused to yield. The woman hugged her knees tightly to her chest, her chin resting on spectral joints. None spoke. None *needed* to.

I followed the old man’s gaze eastward again, straining to see what he saw—or perhaps what he only hoped to see. But the void stared back at me with indifference.

A shudder passed through the group like an electric current rippling through their forms. The woman’s hum sharpened into a whine; the girl’s fingers froze mid-pluck.

I pressed forward with the question clawing up my throat: “If heaven’s real… is *hell*?”

The old man laughed—a dry rasp like beetles scuttling over dead leaves. “*Hell* is a fairy tale. A scarecrow.” He spread his arms wide, encompassing the frozen field around us—the waiting, the *nothing*. “Souls linger here until the angel comes to get them. I don’t think there’s a hell—it’s only this for us.”

The others blurred at their edges, their forms pixelating like corrupted film frames struggling to hold shape. The girl hissed softly, her voice frayed and brittle: “He’s been here longest. He *thinks* he knows. He *doesn’t*.”

The old man ignored her entirely. His gaze latched onto the horizon again, ravenous and unblinking. “You’ll learn the truths in heaven,” he said softly but firmly. “Ask God about hell. About us. About why your first breath mattered.” A pause stretched taut between us before he added: “Then come back and *tell* us… if you can.”

Silence smothered the group like an oppressive fog.

The woman resumed rocking in place, her hum now tuneless and arrhythmic—a sound that gnawed at my nerves without rhythm or melody.

Above us, the void deepened further still—the clouds glowing whiter now—or was it my chest-light bleeding into this faux-sky?

I opened my mouth—

“Enough.” The old man raised a single finger sharply to silence me before I could speak further. “Save your breath,” he said flatly but not unkindly. “You’ll need it… *there*.”

Time thickened around us like syrup poured over glass.

We sat together in silence—an excruciating stillness akin to holding one’s breath indefinitely—as though someone had pressed pause on existence itself. The old man’s quartz-like eyes drilled into the eastern void with unwavering focus while my questions curdled inside me, unspoken yet unbearably heavy—their weight crushing against my ghostly ribs.

Then—  

A tremor fissured the air—not a sound, but a *frequency*, a subsonic drone that vibrated the marrow of my translucent bones. The grass remained petrified, unyielding, but *we* shuddered, our forms rippling like oil on water. Above the eastern horizon, the void tore open with a soundless scream, its edges bleeding molten gold. From the rift poured light so pure it seared my ghostly eyes, etching afterimages of prismatic static onto my vision. And then the *thing* emerged.

It unfolded like an ancient star exhaling its first breath—a colossal orb armored in segmented plates of bone-white and gilt, each joint humming with celestial harmonics that resonated in my chest like the tolling of cathedral bells. Wings wider than cityscapes arched from its flanks, but these were no feathered limbs. They writhed with thousands of eyes—human pupils dilated in terror, goat-slitted irises glowing sulfur-yellow, compound insect lenses fracturing light into rainbows. Each eye blinked in discordant rhythm, their depths swirling with dying galaxies, newborn nebulae, and the cold fire of quasars being born.

The group jerked upright as one, their limbs snapping taut as if yanked by invisible strings. The old man wheeled toward me, his lips contorting soundlessly, his face a mask of raw hunger and venom. The angel’s wings beat once—a thunderclap that compressed the air into a diamond-hard wall—but not a single blade of grass quivered beneath us. It hovered there, suspended in its incomprehensible majesty, every eye swiveling to pin me in a kaleidoscope of gazes.

The voice impaled my skull:  

**DO NOT BE AFRAID.**  

It was not sound but *sensation*—the taste of copper and burnt honey on my tongue; the smell of glaciers calving into arctic seas; the pressure of a supernova’s shockwave flattening my form into nothingness. My knees buckled under its weight, yet my terror dissolved into a narcotic haze—thick as opium smoke—coating my mind in velvet oblivion.

**COME.**  

I moved without volition—a marionette tugged skyward by invisible strings. The angel’s carapace peeled open with mechanical precision, its segmented plates retracting like the petals of some obscene metal flower. Within lay a core of liquid light that churned and writhed like molten plasma. It cascaded over me in a torrent, dissolving my translucent flesh in layers: first skin (cold and sharp, like alcohol evaporating), then muscle (a sigh of release), then bone (the snap of a shackle breaking). I should have screamed—but instead, I *unraveled*.  

**YOU WILL DO PERFECTLY.**  

The light was neither warm nor cold—it was *revelation*. It flayed me to my essence, stripping away doubt, memory, fear—everything—until only a single radiant thread remained: pure and untainted by thought or form. My disintegration was not agony but *surrender*, the relief of a marathoner collapsing at the finish line: lungs heaving, soul singing.

I ascended. The eyes on the wings tracked my rise with unblinking precision, galaxies spinning in their depths like cosmic clocks ticking down to some unknowable end. Below me, the figures dwindled: the old man’s mouth twisted into a silent curse; the girl’s half-raised hand trembled as though fighting an invisible leash that bound her to this place. Then the rift sealed itself with a wet, organic *snick*, and Anamoní winked out of existence.

The light swelled—a supernova in reverse—its brilliance contracting inward until it dimmed to a dying ember.

Darkness.

Not the hungry void I had seen before but something softer—a velvety oblivion dense with possibility. Somewhere in its depths, a faint hum resonated, the echo of a heartbeat… or perhaps the birth-cry of a star.

Consciousness seeped back like ink spreading through oil. I blinked, and the sterile void of Anamoní had been replaced by a gilded nightmare. The field around me teemed with grass that *moved*—blades rippling in a breeze that carried no scent, no warmth.

Beyond stretched a city that defied physics, spires of molten gold twisted into fractal patterns, bridges of translucent crystal arcing between towers like frozen lightning. The structures pulsed faintly, as though breathing, their surfaces crawling with hieroglyphs that squirmed when stared at directly.

Far beyond it all loomed a throne the size of a mountain range, its edges blurred by distance and the sheer impossibility of its scale. Upon it sat a figure of pure radiance, its form shifting between humanoid and geometric abstraction, a head like a dying star swiveling slowly to survey its domain. The light from it pressed against my vision—not blinding but oppressive, like standing too close to an open furnace. I spun, searching for the old man, the girl—but I was alone.

Until I wasn’t.

They appeared without sound—two men carved from wax by a deranged sculptor. The taller one’s hair gleamed like polished brass; his companion’s was obsidian-black. Their features were mirror-symmetrical to the millimeter, too perfect to be human. No pores marred their alabaster skin; their eyelids didn’t flutter when they blinked. They moved in staggered unison, the shorter one always half a step behind.

Their robes shimmered with false humility, threads of light weaving through linen that hissed faintly, like radio static caught between stations. The shorter one tilted his head, eyes swallowing the light—pupils flat and depthless as event horizons. When he smiled, his teeth were slightly too large, slightly too sharp, slightly too white.

“Hello, James.” The taller one’s voice was a wind chime made of bone. “Welcome to heaven’s… *workshop*.” He spread his arms wide, sleeves billowing to reveal wrists jointed like doll limbs. “Ask your questions. We do love fresh perspectives.”

“What’s going *on*?” My voice echoed oddly in the space around us, as if the air itself resisted sound.

The shorter one buzzed—a locust’s rattle trapped in a human throat. “Tell me, James—” He tapped my chest with his fingertip, freezing cold against my translucent flesh. “—does it itch? The light inside? Like a trapped moth battering your ribs?”

I staggered back instinctively. “What *is* it? Why does it feel… *alive*?”

“Because it *hungers*.” The taller one began circling me like a predator stalking prey. “Most souls are clotted with prayer—diluted by millennia of groveling to imaginary gods. But you—” His breath smelled of burnt wiring and ozone. “—you starved yours. Let it grow *feral*. Untamed. A perfect battery.”

“Battery? For *what*?” My voice cracked under the weight of his words.

The shorter one giggled—a sound like breaking glass underfoot. “The gears of paradise, James! The engines that spin the stars!” He gestured toward the distant throne with mock reverence. “Even *He* needs fuel. Especially now—with so few pure souls left to burn.”

“But I didn’t *believe*! Why me?” My words tumbled out in desperation.

“Belief is a *contaminant*.” The taller one’s smile stretched unnaturally wide, lips splitting at the corners without bleeding. “You’re a virgin wellspring: no saints, no sins, no tainted dogma—just raw, screaming *potential*.”

I backed away further this time, my heels sinking into grass that gripped like tar. “You can’t just *take* it—”

“Can’t we?” The taller one purred as if savoring my resistance. “But we’re so *generous*. We’ll even trade: a gift for a gift.” His pupils dilated until they swallowed his irises whole. “What does your mortal heart crave, James? Wealth? Power? Wings to flutter about like some songbird?”

The question curdled in the air between us.

“Do I… have a choice?” My voice was barely above a whisper now.

The shorter one leaned in close enough for me to feel his breath—a dry rasp against my skin. “Choice is a *fairy tale*,” he hissed through teeth too sharp for his mouth. His tongue flickered briefly—forked and serpentine before retreating behind his grin. “But we’ll pretend you do. Play along! It’s more *fun*.”

My mind scrabbled for leverage as panic clawed at me from within. The throne’s light pulsed in my peripheral vision—a migraine wrapped in majesty—and I blurted out the first thing I could think of: “I—I want to fly! To be an angel.”

They froze.

Then the shorter one *howled*, laughter shredding through the air in dissonant harmonics that made my ears ache. “*Fly?* You think feathers and harps? Oh, James—” He clutched his sides as if he might split open from amusement; his ribs creaked audibly under the strain. “—you’ll fly alright! Straight into the furnace!”

The taller one raised a hand sharply, silencing him with an almost imperceptible gesture. His expression softened into something resembling pity—or perhaps mockery disguised as mercy.

“If flight is your desire…” His fingers snapped once.

The air tore open.

A portal bloomed before us—a gyre of cobalt and magnesium-white light whose edges gnawed at reality itself like acid eating through fabric. The shorter one seized my arm with talons disguised as fingers; his grip burned cold against my spectral flesh.

“Come, fledgling!” he hissed gleefully. “Let’s clip your wings!”

I resisted instinctively—but the light inside my chest betrayed me: it tugged toward them as if magnetized by their presence or their willpower alone.

My body lurched forward without consent.

They stepped through first—their forms unraveling into shadow-puppet silhouettes as they disappeared into the portal’s swirling depths. It hummed ominously—a dentist’s drill amplified through infinite black holes—and then it was my turn.

I followed.

**The air turned gelid**, thick with the sterile stench of formaldehyde and ozone. The room’s whiteness wasn’t just light—it was *absence*, leaching color from my vision until the world blurred into a nauseating void. Then I saw them: **a thousand eyes**, bulging from every surface like tumors. Their lids peeled back wetly, irises kaleidoscoping between reptilian slits and human pupils, each gaze drilling into me with predatory focus. The floor undulated faintly, a living carpet of eyeballs rolling beneath my feet, their viscous tears pooling around my ankles.

**The golden slab dominated the room**, sculpted into a gargantuan hand frozen mid-*reach*, fingers curled into talons. Its surface writhed with glyphs that squirmed like tapeworms, their edges glowing faintly bioluminescent, as if fed by rot. The air around it warped, humming with a subsonic frequency that vibrated my teeth.

*“Lie down.”*

The shorter one’s voice wasn’t a sound—it was a command etched directly into my skull.

**I stumbled backward**, but the eyes on the floor *shifted*, their collective gaze herding me toward the slab. My chest-light flickered erratically, casting jagged shadows that slithered up the walls like sentient stains.

*“Lie. Down.”*

His words splintered into echoes, each syllable sharper than the last.

**Light-ropes lashed out**—serpentine tendrils of liquid nitrogen, hissing and steaming as they coiled around my limbs. Their touch *burned* with a cold so absolute it felt like fire, searing through my spectral flesh into the core of whatever passed for my soul. I screamed, but the sound fractured into static, swallowed by the room’s insatiable whiteness.

The slab throbbed beneath me, its vibrations syncing with my unraveling pulse. The glyphs squirmed faster now, forming patterns that made my mind recoil—a language of tumors, of broken bones, of starved things chewing through the walls of reality.

The taller one raised a **prismatic shard**, its edges fracturing light into colors that *hurt*—ultraviolet, infrared, hues no human eye should perceive. *“Painless,”* he lied as he drove the shard into my shoulder blade.

**My memories hemorrhaged**.

First to go: my mother’s voice singing lullabies, dissolving into radio static. Then my first kiss—lips turning to ash; the taste of strawberry gum replaced by bile. The sting of a skinned knee; the thrill of a childhood bicycle ride; the warmth of a dog’s fur… all siphoned into the slab’s ravenous glow.

Voices (mine? Theirs? *Others’?*) gibbered in a guttural tongue:

*“Sclépius… Voré… Aphanízesthai…”*

**The wing was a living blasphemy**—feathers of rusted iron, membranes veined with pulsating maggots, talons dripping viscous black fluid. The taller one rammed it into my shoulder blade. It *writhed*, burrowing into me with a sound like teeth grinding on bone. My back arched as the wing fused to my spine, tendrils of rot spreading through my veins like ink in water.

**A flicker beyond the void**:
- - -
*Beep… beep… beep…*

A hospital ceiling.

A defibrillator’s crack.

*“Clear!”*

My corpse jolted on the gurney.

A nurse’s glove gripped my face:

*“James! Stay with me!”*

**Back in the white hell**, the shorter one sawed into my other shoulder blade, his serrated blade screeching against spectral bone. *“Hurry!”* he spat as the taller one slammed the second wing into me—this one chitinous and iridescent, its edges sharp enough to split atoms.

My chest-light dimmed further now, its radiance siphoned into the slab like blood draining from an open wound.

**Another flicker**:
- - -
*Beep-beep-beep-beep.*

A needle’s bite.

Cold fluid flooding my veins.

*“V-fib converting! Don’t stop compressions!”*

The shorter one flipped me onto my stomach**, pinning me as the wings twitched to life—their grotesque sinews knotting themselves into muscle and bone. He plunged a scalpel deep into my sternum. Light—my light—gushed out in torrents, pooling on the slab before evaporating into hungry glyphs.

*“TAKE IT!”* he howled, claws raking at my chest.

The taller one’s hands melted through my ribs like liquid mercury, grasping for the core of my soul-light. *“It’s rooted—he’s fighting us!”*

The shorter one’s face unraveled**—jaw unhinging; teeth splintering into glass shards; tongue elongating into a proboscis that stabbed toward my eye. *“You’ll crawl back,”* he hissed through his disintegrating grin. *“We’ll carve you out of that meatsack—we’ll—”*

---

*Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.*

Steady now. Relentless.

*“Pulse stabilizing!”*

*“James? Squeeze my hand!”*

---

The white room shattered**.

Eyes burst like overripe fruit.

Wings crumbled to carcinogenic dust.

The men’s screams faded—not into silence but into something more human, the wail of a heart monitor.

---

**Darkness**.

Then—

**Weight**.

**Heat**.

**A throat raw from screaming**.

Fingers gripping mine tightly now—a tether pulling me back from oblivion.

*“Welcome back James”*

A face swam into focus—a man in blue scrubs, his features softened by the halo of fluorescent lights above. His stethoscope gleamed cold against his chest, and his breath smelled of spearmint gum and exhaustion. Behind him, monitors chirped arrhythmically, their screens casting jagged green shadows over the walls. My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth, cotton-dry, as I tried to speak.

“You’re a miracle!” The doctor’s voice cracked with a mix of awe and sleep deprivation. His pupils dilated slightly as he said it, as though even he didn’t believe his own words. A nurse hovered behind him, adjusting an IV bag with hands still trembling from the adrenaline of revival.

Reality seeped back in layers. The beep of the heart monitor synced with my pulse—*alive, alive, alive*. The starch-stiff sheets chafed my arms. The scent of antiseptic burned my nostrils. I clawed at the neck of my gown, gasping, expecting wings to burst from my back or golden ropes to snake around my wrists. But there was only the drip of the IV, the flicker of a muted TV in the corner, and the distant wail of a code blue over the hospital PA.

Weeks dissolved into a haze of needle sticks and midnight panic attacks. ICU nights blurred into rehab mornings; my legs trembled like a fawn’s as I relearned stairs that now seemed to warp like Anamoní’s horizon. The cardiologist’s words played on loop during treadmill sessions: *“Ventricular fibrillation… chaotic electrical impulses…”* He traced my EKG with a manicured nail, oblivious to how its glyph-like squiggles made me vomit into biohazard bins. *“No blood flow for 10 minutes—miraculous you’re here.”* I nodded absently, fingering the new scar on my sternum—a raised star-shaped keloid no surgeon could explain.

I never spoke of the eyes. The throne. The thing that called itself an angel.

*They’d lock you up,* whispered shadows pooling beneath fluorescent lights during sleepless nights.

*They’ll say it’s hypoxia,* hissed MRI machines as they scanned me for damage they couldn’t see.

So I let them chart my “PTSD” and “ICU delirium,” swallowing pills that made everything gauzy and dull.

To anyone reading this:

Heaven is not what they told us.

It’s not gates or gold or glory—it’s machinery.

Anamoní is its waiting room.

If you see the throne… if you see wings… if men with oil-slick eyes whisper your name—

**Run.**

**Fight.**

**Let your soul burn out before they can siphon it dry.**

Better to fade into purgatory’s static than fuel their gilded eternity.

I know how it sounds.

I know what you’ll say.

But lean close—I’ll show you the scars where they tried to carve me open…  

how it glows in the dark at 10:00 PM.

1imbm7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideBereavement/comments/1imbm7h/a_year_ago_today_was_the_last_time_i_saw_my_dad/,A year ago today was the last time I saw my dad.,"Last February I flew back home to visit family and friends and brought my boyfriend with me.

We stayed with my sister and her husband the first two nights, then at a hotel the remaining three nights. When we got to the hotel I called my dad to see when he would like to get together, and he asked how long I'd been in town. I told him two nights, to which he responded ""oh well I can tell I'm a big priority""

I clenched my jaw and asked if he was free for an early lunch the next day, and he said, ""whenever works for you, whenever you have time for me.""

The next morning he cancelled, saying he had been up all night and needed to rest.

We ended up seeing him right before we left for the airport on the 10th, at an outside table at a small coffee shop. I was already so annoyed and angry.. I don't know.

I left my phone at the airport later that day and had to buy a new one the next morning. I thought maybe my dad texted me and I didn't want him to worry, so I texted him saying I'd lost my phone but got a new one, and that it was nice to see him, I was happy he got to meet my boyfriend, and that I hoped next time we would get to see more of each other. He wrote back ""Me too. I need to get a new phone myself this one gives me trouble.""

I decided then and there that I wouldn't respond to him anymore, and that I never wanted to talk to him again. I didn't.

In September he texted me a suicide threat, blaming my ""hate for him"" and I blocked his number after reading it. Three days later the Coast Guard found his empty boat 30 miles offshore.

I don't feel anything anymore.. about anything. I've changed so much as a person. I barely know who I am anymore. I feel tired all the time and emotionally ..removed. I feel very removed.",9,1739208466.0,SuicideBereavement,0,1.0,False

1imblnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1imblnj/coworker_and_i_hit_off_really_welland_now_feel/,Co-worker and I hit off really well...and now feel like total strangers...help...,"Apologies for A) this is going to be a long one and B) Is it ok to re-post this in the dating section??

Around August 2024, the company I (44M) work for (event lighting company) hired a new repair person (30F just moved from North Carolina, gothy vibes, chill and geeky with a mischevious sense of humor)and since I use to have her position (I now have more of an office job in same company)we got to know each other well since I was helping field her questions. 

Eventually I gave her my # and told her ""For any repair questions and /or funny cat memes"" A few days later I get a funny cat pic from her (her cat in a leg cast that uh looks VERY phallic).Basically my type of humor so off to the texting races we go!!Conversation flowed well that night getting to know her more nerdy side and texting every other day about random nerdy/ low level personal stuff/cute dog cat pics..so she was definitely in my wheelhouse.. Eventually threw in some mildy flirty responses to which she picked up on right away and texts me ""I hope your not flirting with me,not looking for that at this moment in time"" I responded with a thumbs up and ""noted"" "" The Hispanic side of me can come off as flirty sometimes."" I really thought that would of been the end of that but to to my surprise she response back something along the lines of ""OMG me too the theatrical side of me always comes off as flirty...etc."" And we proceeded to keep texting about how silly it can be to be adults sometimes/ and then the conversation that night actually blossomed from there( from asking me what to wear to our Christmas party to talking about Weird Al🤣It was all over the place) 

So one day she asked me if there were any good places to eat because she wanted to treat herself. I told her about a Chinese restaurant a few towns over near me and a Brazillian place that was literally two blocks up from my apt. She eventually texts me saying she decided on the Brazillian place and I asked if she wanted some company to which she didn't respond...I happened to be on my way back to my apt. around this time and decided to surprise her (which..now that I think about it typing this out was a risky thing to do and my self assured-ness got the best of me...I thought maybe she was just being coy🤷‍♂️)I get there and she's in the buffet line looking stunning! cute red dress complimented by a black corset/leather jacket/ hair done/makeup,etc...my heart dropped...and my nerves got on full alert. I gave her a hug we sat down to eat and even said hey look if you really don't want me here I can bounce and she was ""na its cool , I was 50/50 on it.""We proceeded to have a nice dinner with good conversation when she drops the bombshell that its her birthday. I tell her well you can't have a birthday without desert so I took her out for a slice of cake afterward. It was very cute because there happened to be two other people also celebrating birthdays sitting near us and we chatted them up ...it was overall a positive fun night.On the way back to our cars we stop to say goodbye, hug and I give her a small kiss on the cheek. She doesn't say anything until she's about to get into her car and I quote "" A KISS ON THE CHEEK!?"" and gets in her car. I was stunned...I awkardly try to go over to rectify but she's already in the car...I think talking to someone on the phone??Anyway I get back in my car defeated feeling stupid AF and I'm like well this all over.But nopeee....She texts me when she gets home stating that the kiss was unexpected but had a nice time and excitedly sends me pics of some new pups her landlady adopted. 

So...once again we keep talking that week...same energy and vibes and eventually I ask her out two times...my intentions are I just want to see how a proper date would go.I send her a text around 10am on a Mon asking her out to go sledding after work(we had some perfect snow right before Christmas; also I was already on my vacation around this time) and she completely ignores the text until later that evening to which she replies "" I should have taken you up on it. Guess who got their crunched bumper crunched again. 🤣Kaaarmmaaa"" It put me off a bit but I asked if she was ok and she said she was fine. This was around the time our texting back and forth died down a little bit ...and I started to get in my head about it. I should note she did text me ""Feliz Navidad"" and ""Feliz Nuevo año"" texts...(yes she wrote them in spanish which I thought was cute..and the New Years one was sent pretty much right at midnight...guess not that it matters) So here I'm with my hopes up again....and therefore decide to try one more time a few days later...ask her out and she actually responds with my stomach isn't feeling well/ I'm on my period.I was too mentally tired to respond with anything at the time and sent her some rando meme later in the evening to which she didn't respond to at all.

 I should note that by this point alot of our texting conversations always ended with me,well, overreplying and a 50/50 chance of getting resposnes back...so I was honestly surprised by the fact she told me she was sick. At this point I started to just give up and prepare myself to let it go...
Until she asked me out about a week later (This is now after New Years) with this text:""Current nerd activity: coffee? I'm not good at adult friends, but I'd like to catch up and not get dinged at work. 😅"" We met for coffee had ,once again, good conversation which eventually led into the whole dating thing and to clear up what was going on. She told me she wasn't in a good mental headspace to date currently but liked me because I was chill and was more open to fun friend dates. I was totally ok with that respected thats what she wanted to do...and honestly the following week was fine. We still texted...not really as frequently but what you would expect from two friends.

Cut to now as I write this.In the fast few weeks its died down alot alot more..like maybe one conversation a week..and to the point were I was the one initiating conversation. Even running into her at work it feels like we talk for like 30 seconds or so and she wants to pulls away. I'm just getting some icy vibes to the point were it feels like she dosen't want to even be my friend and its honestly killing me inside.I've completely stopped texting her and avoid her at work (which is not hard to do) and it all just feels so sh**tty. I feel like I did something terribly wrong and coming to work every day and feeling like this sucks...so should I reach out one more time and try to talk to her or just let it play out?????

* Studying: 2-4 hours a day, 5 times a week
* Exam results: Mostly C's and B's, rarely an A
* Stuck and frustrated with my academic performance because i knew deep-down i could do way better

 What I Changed :

Study Routine -->

\- 8AM to 2PM, 4PM to 8PM (i got sick one time, except that i sticked with routine)

\- Active learning techniques instead of passive reading

\- Consistent daily studying with clear goals

\- Used Pomodoro mostly, 25/5, 30/10, 50/10, 52/17, every study technique on peazehub basically



Lifestyle -->

\- Increased water intake (minimum 2L per day)

\- Improved sleep quality (consistent 6-8 hours)

\- Regular, balanced meals (2 meals a day as a student is a lot for me)

\- Reduced random social media scrolling, deleted instagram, no more yt shorts

\- Took short breaks during study sessions



Physical and Mental changes -->

\- Lost 2 kg, I eat 2 meals a day and sometimes it's not enough

\- Unfortunately, drinking too much coffee and tea

\- Under-eye bags slightly worse because I study on laptop all day long

\- Mental clarity SIGNIFICANTLY changed, I can almost focus whenever i want in 5-10 mins and lock in for 3-4 hours 

\- More consistent energy, tea and coffee helps a lot but probably not that healthy 

\- Better mood, I sleep better because I kinda am proud of myself for studying consistently so far



Results

\- More confident in my studies, I'll have exams soon i might update results

\- Better overall learning experience

\- Healthier routine (except too much coffee)",55,1739208062.0,GetStudying,22,0.98,False

I went to heaven, and what I saw there defied every Sunday school parable, every psalm, every sermon about gates of pearl and streets of gold.","First, there was the dying.  

The highway unspooled like a strip of charcoal beneath a sickly purple dusk. My hands strangled the steering wheel, still trembling from ten hours in the Amazon warehouse—a cavern of fluorescent hell where conveyor belts rattled like skeletons and managers barked through headset static. My shirt clung to my back, damp with the greasy sweat of exhaustion. Then, the fist.  

It began as a pressure, a slow cinching beneath my ribs, as if an invisible hand were kneading my heart like dough. I rubbed my sternum, fingertips catching on the logo of my polo. The pain sharpened. By the time I veered onto the exit ramp, my breaths came in shallow sips, as though the air had been siphoned from the car. My pulse skittered—*rabbit-fast, rabbit-terrified*—against the cage of my ribs.  

Gravel popped beneath my tires as I lurched into the driveway. The engine coughed into silence. Outside, the neighborhood slept under a sodium-vapor haze, the only sound the *tick-tick-tick* of cooling metal. I staggered out, legs jelly-weak, and the world tilted. The porch steps warped, wood planks stretching like taffy. My shoe caught the edge of the second step.  

For a suspended heartbeat, I floated.  

Then pavement rose—a cold, starless galaxy—to meet me. My elbows shredded on asphalt as I crab-walked backward, sneakers squealing, until the road cradled me. Headlights exploded in my vision. Tires screamed. A sedan halted inches from my skull, close enough to taste the acrid stink of scorched rubber. A woman tumbled out, her face moon-pale under the streetlamp’s jaundiced glow. “Oh God—!” Her voice cracked. “Are you—?”  

She froze.  

My mouth moved, but sound died in my throat.  

My vision swam—her blonde hair smeared into a halo, her Honda’s hazard lights bleeding neon pink and green. The maple tree in my yard multiplied, three trembling copies clawing at a sky now spinning like a carousel. My heart galloped, a feral thing kicking at my ribs. She backpedaled, phone pressed to her ear.

“*Send someone—he’s not breathing!*”  

Sirens warbled in the distance. Time frayed:  
Red and blue strobing lights cutting through shadows; gloved hands; a stretcher’s nylon straps biting into my shoulders; a paramedic’s walkie-talkie spitting jargon: *“VFib… BP 60 over palp… no carotid pulse…”*  

“Stay with us, buddy.” A hand patted my cheek—vinyl glove cold and insistent. The oxygen mask clamped over my face reeked of plastic and desperation. Above me, the ambulance ceiling swam into focus: water-stained tiles; a Rorschach blot of old coffee (or blood?); a dangling penlight swaying like a metronome.

Darkness yawned.

I let it swallow me.

Consciousness returned in shards:  
Blurred ceiling tiles streaked past; wheels clattered beneath the gurney; antiseptic scorched my nostrils; voices spliced through fog.

“—losing pulses—”  

“—charge to 200—”  

A crash cart rattled nearby as ER lights glared—merciless and interrogative—before sputtering into black.

“We’re losing him!”  

The shout pierced through sterile darkness like shattered glass.

Then—

*Nothing.*

A void without temperature or sound or even vibration—the faintest hum of electricity absent from this place.

*This is death*, I thought.

*This is—*

Later they’d explain it clinically: *Ventricular fibrillation,* the cardiologist said while tracing squiggles on an EKG printout: *Chaotic electrical impulses… no blood flow… miraculous you’re here.* 

But in those **10 minutes**, there were no monitors or medical Latin or miracles.

Only the *other place*.  

I woke on my back, spine pressed into a surface that mimicked grass—pliant yet unyielding, like memory foam carved into blades. Above me stretched a sky that defied language. Clouds hung frozen, their edges unnaturally crisp, as if cut from bleached felt and glued to an abyss. The void behind them was not mere darkness but *erasure*, a vacuum that gnawed at the edges of perception, like staring into the static between radio stations. Only the clouds tethered me to reality, their faint bioluminescent glow suggesting some alien photosynthesis, pulsing in slow, arrhythmic waves.

The field stretched infinitely in all directions, a fractal nightmare of uniformity. Each blade of grass was identical—chartreuse at the base, fading to citrine at the tip, precisely three millimeters wide. No soil nestled between them; they sprouted from a seamless mat of dull silver, like AstroTurf woven by machines. When I pressed my palm down, the stems didn’t bend. They resisted like plastic bristles yet emitted a faint organic musk—sweet and cloying, like rotting lilies. The air hung thick, devoid of humidity or temperature, as though the atmosphere itself had been vacuum-sealed.

Time dissolved. Seconds bled into hours. My hand drifted to my chest—no rise, no fall. I clawed at my throat, fingertips sinking into gelatinous flesh that reknit instantly. Panic flared briefly in my mind but dissipated just as quickly; my body remained inert—a marionette with severed strings. When I raised my arm, the non-light of this place seeped through my skin, revealing a lattice of veins like cracked porcelain. My “flesh” was vellum soaked in glycerin; the grass beneath was visible as smudged impressions—a Magic Eye painting gone wrong. I waved a hand. No shadow followed. No proof I existed at all.

A scream tore through my skull—silent and airless—a vacuum-sealed eruption that left no echo in this sterile void. My jaw unhinged grotesquely, tendons straining against their limits, yet no vibration troubled the stagnant air. Fear metastasized in my gut—a tumor with teeth—but my face stayed slack: a wax museum replica of terror.

Movement flickered at the edge of my dead-aquarium vision. Three figures sat lotus-style in the distance, their nudity neither provocative nor obscene—as if gender and modesty had been scrubbed from them entirely. Their skin mirrored mine: semi-opaque with a faint opalescent sheen, like soap bubbles moments before bursting. The oldest (or perhaps merely the most eroded?) rose first, his feet levitating a micron above the grass. Each step left no imprint or whisper of friction; he seemed to traverse a hologram rather than solid ground. Up close, his face resembled a Botticelli angel—flawless symmetry marred only by eyes without lids or lashes and lips that moved a half-second out of sync with his words.

“Don’t worry.” The voice emanated from everywhere—the grass beneath me, the air around me, the inside of my molars. It resonated like a bow dragged across cello strings, vibrating deep in my marrow. “Everyone feels this way at first.”

He gestured toward the others: The woman hugged her knees tightly to her chest; her hair was frozen mid-sway—a cascade of liquid mercury caught in time. The teenage girl plucked at grass blades with fingers that passed through them like mist; her face was a mask of automated boredom. Their bodies flickered faintly as if buffering—edges pixelating like corrupted JPEGs struggling to render fully.

“Come,” the old man intoned softly but firmly. “Sit with us. We’ll answer what we can.”

Terror should have petrified me—but without cortisol or catecholamines coursing through me here in this place where biology had no dominion—fear became nothing more than an abstract concept: theoretical and distant.

I floated forward instead—legs moving with marionette autonomy—and sank cross-legged beside him when commanded to do so. The grass beneath us remained preternaturally stiff: jabbing needle-tip precision into my thighs yet leaving no marks behind.

“You must have many questions.” His voice rumbled through the ground beneath us—a sub-bass growl that vibrated up through my bones until it reached my teeth.

Their eyes pinned me: pupils dilated into black holes surrounded by faintly bioluminescent irises that pulsed faintly like dying embers in milk-glass sockets.

“Where am I?” My voice startled even me when it emerged hollowly—reverberating oddly—as though spoken through an ancient tin-can telephone stretched taut between dimensions.

“You’re in *Anamoní*,” he replied evenly while his lips stretched into something resembling a smile but not quite human enough for comfort—it didn’t crease his marble-smooth face naturally either way.

The name slithered off his tongue like syrup-thick vowels from some archaic dead language resurrected momentarily just long enough for its meaning alone to haunt its listener afterward indefinitely…

I blinked. “So I’m not in heaven?”

“Not yet.” His gesture swept toward the horizon, where the grass fused seamlessly with the anti-sky. “Anamoní is… a purgatory of patience. A sieve.” The others tilted their heads in unison, their necks creaking faintly like unoiled hinges. “We are the residue. The unworthy sediment.”

“Waiting to get into heaven?”

“Yes.” His finger traced the air, painting invisible sigils that dissolved as quickly as they formed. “Sixty-three years for me. Fifty-eight for her.” The woman’s nod was robotic, her hair frozen mid-sway like a suspended waterfall. “Nineteen for the child.” The girl mimed plucking grass, her fingers phasing through blades as static as plastic ferns. “Time here is not time.”

“Why aren’t we *in* heaven?”

He leaned closer, his pupils glowing faintly—twin embers in milk-glass eyes. “The soul must… *molt*. Shed its husk—regret, greed, the rot of living. Until it’s weightless. Pure.” His gaze dropped to my chest. “But yours—yours already *burns*.”

He tapped my sternum with a sound like a dull *thud*, wet clay struck by a fist. “Look.”

I glanced down.

A glow pulsed beneath my wax-paper skin—not the sickly, guttering flicker of the others but a relentless white radiance, as if I’d swallowed a neutron star. The old man recoiled slightly, his own chest dimming like a bulb on a dying circuit.

“You won’t linger here,” he whispered, his voice tinged with venomous envy.

I squinted eastward, where the void blurred into a silver smudge on the horizon. “How do I *leave*?”

“The angel descends for the ready.” The others stiffened at his words, their translucent faces contorting—mouths twitching, eyes narrowing—as if struck by invisible blows. “You’ll see the gate. The rest of us…” His voice frayed and unraveled into silence.

The girl resumed her pantomime, fingers raking through grass that refused to yield. The woman hugged her knees tightly to her chest, her chin resting on spectral joints. None spoke. None *needed* to.

I followed the old man’s gaze eastward again, straining to see what he saw—or perhaps what he only hoped to see. But the void stared back at me with indifference.

A shudder passed through the group like an electric current rippling through their forms. The woman’s hum sharpened into a whine; the girl’s fingers froze mid-pluck.

I pressed forward with the question clawing up my throat: “If heaven’s real… is *hell*?”

The old man laughed—a dry rasp like beetles scuttling over dead leaves. “*Hell* is a fairy tale. A scarecrow.” He spread his arms wide, encompassing the frozen field around us—the waiting, the *nothing*. “Souls linger here until the angel comes to get them. I don’t think there’s a hell—it’s only this for us.”

The others blurred at their edges, their forms pixelating like corrupted film frames struggling to hold shape. The girl hissed softly, her voice frayed and brittle: “He’s been here longest. He *thinks* he knows. He *doesn’t*.”

The old man ignored her entirely. His gaze latched onto the horizon again, ravenous and unblinking. “You’ll learn the truths in heaven,” he said softly but firmly. “Ask God about hell. About us. About why your first breath mattered.” A pause stretched taut between us before he added: “Then come back and *tell* us… if you can.”

Silence smothered the group like an oppressive fog.

The woman resumed rocking in place, her hum now tuneless and arrhythmic—a sound that gnawed at my nerves without rhythm or melody.

Above us, the void deepened further still—the clouds glowing whiter now—or was it my chest-light bleeding into this faux-sky?

I opened my mouth—

“Enough.” The old man raised a single finger sharply to silence me before I could speak further. “Save your breath,” he said flatly but not unkindly. “You’ll need it… *there*.”

Time thickened around us like syrup poured over glass.

We sat together in silence—an excruciating stillness akin to holding one’s breath indefinitely—as though someone had pressed pause on existence itself. The old man’s quartz-like eyes drilled into the eastern void with unwavering focus while my questions curdled inside me, unspoken yet unbearably heavy—their weight crushing against my ghostly ribs.

Then—  

A tremor fissured the air—not a sound, but a *frequency*, a subsonic drone that vibrated the marrow of my translucent bones. The grass remained petrified, unyielding, but *we* shuddered, our forms rippling like oil on water. Above the eastern horizon, the void tore open with a soundless scream, its edges bleeding molten gold. From the rift poured light so pure it seared my ghostly eyes, etching afterimages of prismatic static onto my vision. And then the *thing* emerged.

It unfolded like an ancient star exhaling its first breath—a colossal orb armored in segmented plates of bone-white and gilt, each joint humming with celestial harmonics that resonated in my chest like the tolling of cathedral bells. Wings wider than cityscapes arched from its flanks, but these were no feathered limbs. They writhed with thousands of eyes—human pupils dilated in terror, goat-slitted irises glowing sulfur-yellow, compound insect lenses fracturing light into rainbows. Each eye blinked in discordant rhythm, their depths swirling with dying galaxies, newborn nebulae, and the cold fire of quasars being born.

The group jerked upright as one, their limbs snapping taut as if yanked by invisible strings. The old man wheeled toward me, his lips contorting soundlessly, his face a mask of raw hunger and venom. The angel’s wings beat once—a thunderclap that compressed the air into a diamond-hard wall—but not a single blade of grass quivered beneath us. It hovered there, suspended in its incomprehensible majesty, every eye swiveling to pin me in a kaleidoscope of gazes.

The voice impaled my skull:  

**DO NOT BE AFRAID.**  

It was not sound but *sensation*—the taste of copper and burnt honey on my tongue; the smell of glaciers calving into arctic seas; the pressure of a supernova’s shockwave flattening my form into nothingness. My knees buckled under its weight, yet my terror dissolved into a narcotic haze—thick as opium smoke—coating my mind in velvet oblivion.

**COME.**  

I moved without volition—a marionette tugged skyward by invisible strings. The angel’s carapace peeled open with mechanical precision, its segmented plates retracting like the petals of some obscene metal flower. Within lay a core of liquid light that churned and writhed like molten plasma. It cascaded over me in a torrent, dissolving my translucent flesh in layers: first skin (cold and sharp, like alcohol evaporating), then muscle (a sigh of release), then bone (the snap of a shackle breaking). I should have screamed—but instead, I *unraveled*.  

**YOU WILL DO PERFECTLY.**  

The light was neither warm nor cold—it was *revelation*. It flayed me to my essence, stripping away doubt, memory, fear—everything—until only a single radiant thread remained: pure and untainted by thought or form. My disintegration was not agony but *surrender*, the relief of a marathoner collapsing at the finish line: lungs heaving, soul singing.

I ascended. The eyes on the wings tracked my rise with unblinking precision, galaxies spinning in their depths like cosmic clocks ticking down to some unknowable end. Below me, the figures dwindled: the old man’s mouth twisted into a silent curse; the girl’s half-raised hand trembled as though fighting an invisible leash that bound her to this place. Then the rift sealed itself with a wet, organic *snick*, and Anamoní winked out of existence.

The light swelled—a supernova in reverse—its brilliance contracting inward until it dimmed to a dying ember.

Darkness.

Not the hungry void I had seen before but something softer—a velvety oblivion dense with possibility. Somewhere in its depths, a faint hum resonated, the echo of a heartbeat… or perhaps the birth-cry of a star.

Consciousness seeped back like ink spreading through oil. I blinked, and the sterile void of Anamoní had been replaced by a gilded nightmare. The field around me teemed with grass that *moved*—blades rippling in a breeze that carried no scent, no warmth.

Beyond stretched a city that defied physics, spires of molten gold twisted into fractal patterns, bridges of translucent crystal arcing between towers like frozen lightning. The structures pulsed faintly, as though breathing, their surfaces crawling with hieroglyphs that squirmed when stared at directly.

Far beyond it all loomed a throne the size of a mountain range, its edges blurred by distance and the sheer impossibility of its scale. Upon it sat a figure of pure radiance, its form shifting between humanoid and geometric abstraction, a head like a dying star swiveling slowly to survey its domain. The light from it pressed against my vision—not blinding but oppressive, like standing too close to an open furnace. I spun, searching for the old man, the girl—but I was alone.

Until I wasn’t.

They appeared without sound—two men carved from wax by a deranged sculptor. The taller one’s hair gleamed like polished brass; his companion’s was obsidian-black. Their features were mirror-symmetrical to the millimeter, too perfect to be human. No pores marred their alabaster skin; their eyelids didn’t flutter when they blinked. They moved in staggered unison, the shorter one always half a step behind.

Their robes shimmered with false humility, threads of light weaving through linen that hissed faintly, like radio static caught between stations. The shorter one tilted his head, eyes swallowing the light—pupils flat and depthless as event horizons. When he smiled, his teeth were slightly too large, slightly too sharp, slightly too white.

“Hello, James.” The taller one’s voice was a wind chime made of bone. “Welcome to heaven’s… *workshop*.” He spread his arms wide, sleeves billowing to reveal wrists jointed like doll limbs. “Ask your questions. We do love fresh perspectives.”

“What’s going *on*?” My voice echoed oddly in the space around us, as if the air itself resisted sound.

The shorter one buzzed—a locust’s rattle trapped in a human throat. “Tell me, James—” He tapped my chest with his fingertip, freezing cold against my translucent flesh. “—does it itch? The light inside? Like a trapped moth battering your ribs?”

I staggered back instinctively. “What *is* it? Why does it feel… *alive*?”

“Because it *hungers*.” The taller one began circling me like a predator stalking prey. “Most souls are clotted with prayer—diluted by millennia of groveling to imaginary gods. But you—” His breath smelled of burnt wiring and ozone. “—you starved yours. Let it grow *feral*. Untamed. A perfect battery.”

“Battery? For *what*?” My voice cracked under the weight of his words.

The shorter one giggled—a sound like breaking glass underfoot. “The gears of paradise, James! The engines that spin the stars!” He gestured toward the distant throne with mock reverence. “Even *He* needs fuel. Especially now—with so few pure souls left to burn.”

“But I didn’t *believe*! Why me?” My words tumbled out in desperation.

“Belief is a *contaminant*.” The taller one’s smile stretched unnaturally wide, lips splitting at the corners without bleeding. “You’re a virgin wellspring: no saints, no sins, no tainted dogma—just raw, screaming *potential*.”

I backed away further this time, my heels sinking into grass that gripped like tar. “You can’t just *take* it—”

“Can’t we?” The taller one purred as if savoring my resistance. “But we’re so *generous*. We’ll even trade: a gift for a gift.” His pupils dilated until they swallowed his irises whole. “What does your mortal heart crave, James? Wealth? Power? Wings to flutter about like some songbird?”

The question curdled in the air between us.

“Do I… have a choice?” My voice was barely above a whisper now.

The shorter one leaned in close enough for me to feel his breath—a dry rasp against my skin. “Choice is a *fairy tale*,” he hissed through teeth too sharp for his mouth. His tongue flickered briefly—forked and serpentine before retreating behind his grin. “But we’ll pretend you do. Play along! It’s more *fun*.”

My mind scrabbled for leverage as panic clawed at me from within. The throne’s light pulsed in my peripheral vision—a migraine wrapped in majesty—and I blurted out the first thing I could think of: “I—I want to fly! To be an angel.”

They froze.

Then the shorter one *howled*, laughter shredding through the air in dissonant harmonics that made my ears ache. “*Fly?* You think feathers and harps? Oh, James—” He clutched his sides as if he might split open from amusement; his ribs creaked audibly under the strain. “—you’ll fly alright! Straight into the furnace!”

The taller one raised a hand sharply, silencing him with an almost imperceptible gesture. His expression softened into something resembling pity—or perhaps mockery disguised as mercy.

“If flight is your desire…” His fingers snapped once.

The air tore open.

A portal bloomed before us—a gyre of cobalt and magnesium-white light whose edges gnawed at reality itself like acid eating through fabric. The shorter one seized my arm with talons disguised as fingers; his grip burned cold against my spectral flesh.

“Come, fledgling!” he hissed gleefully. “Let’s clip your wings!”

I resisted instinctively—but the light inside my chest betrayed me: it tugged toward them as if magnetized by their presence or their willpower alone.

My body lurched forward without consent.

They stepped through first—their forms unraveling into shadow-puppet silhouettes as they disappeared into the portal’s swirling depths. It hummed ominously—a dentist’s drill amplified through infinite black holes—and then it was my turn.

I followed.

**The air turned gelid**, thick with the sterile stench of formaldehyde and ozone. The room’s whiteness wasn’t just light—it was *absence*, leaching color from my vision until the world blurred into a nauseating void. Then I saw them: **a thousand eyes**, bulging from every surface like tumors. Their lids peeled back wetly, irises kaleidoscoping between reptilian slits and human pupils, each gaze drilling into me with predatory focus. The floor undulated faintly, a living carpet of eyeballs rolling beneath my feet, their viscous tears pooling around my ankles.

**The golden slab dominated the room**, sculpted into a gargantuan hand frozen mid-*reach*, fingers curled into talons. Its surface writhed with glyphs that squirmed like tapeworms, their edges glowing faintly bioluminescent, as if fed by rot. The air around it warped, humming with a subsonic frequency that vibrated my teeth.

*“Lie down.”*

The shorter one’s voice wasn’t a sound—it was a command etched directly into my skull.

**I stumbled backward**, but the eyes on the floor *shifted*, their collective gaze herding me toward the slab. My chest-light flickered erratically, casting jagged shadows that slithered up the walls like sentient stains.

*“Lie. Down.”*

His words splintered into echoes, each syllable sharper than the last.

**Light-ropes lashed out**—serpentine tendrils of liquid nitrogen, hissing and steaming as they coiled around my limbs. Their touch *burned* with a cold so absolute it felt like fire, searing through my spectral flesh into the core of whatever passed for my soul. I screamed, but the sound fractured into static, swallowed by the room’s insatiable whiteness.

The slab throbbed beneath me, its vibrations syncing with my unraveling pulse. The glyphs squirmed faster now, forming patterns that made my mind recoil—a language of tumors, of broken bones, of starved things chewing through the walls of reality.

The taller one raised a **prismatic shard**, its edges fracturing light into colors that *hurt*—ultraviolet, infrared, hues no human eye should perceive. *“Painless,”* he lied as he drove the shard into my shoulder blade.

**My memories hemorrhaged**.

First to go: my mother’s voice singing lullabies, dissolving into radio static. Then my first kiss—lips turning to ash; the taste of strawberry gum replaced by bile. The sting of a skinned knee; the thrill of a childhood bicycle ride; the warmth of a dog’s fur… all siphoned into the slab’s ravenous glow.

Voices (mine? Theirs? *Others’?*) gibbered in a guttural tongue:

*“Sclépius… Voré… Aphanízesthai…”*

**The wing was a living blasphemy**—feathers of rusted iron, membranes veined with pulsating maggots, talons dripping viscous black fluid. The taller one rammed it into my shoulder blade. It *writhed*, burrowing into me with a sound like teeth grinding on bone. My back arched as the wing fused to my spine, tendrils of rot spreading through my veins like ink in water.

**A flicker beyond the void**:
- - -
*Beep… beep… beep…*

A hospital ceiling.

A defibrillator’s crack.

*“Clear!”*

My corpse jolted on the gurney.

A nurse’s glove gripped my face:

*“James! Stay with me!”*

**Back in the white hell**, the shorter one sawed into my other shoulder blade, his serrated blade screeching against spectral bone. *“Hurry!”* he spat as the taller one slammed the second wing into me—this one chitinous and iridescent, its edges sharp enough to split atoms.

My chest-light dimmed further now, its radiance siphoned into the slab like blood draining from an open wound.

**Another flicker**:
- - -
*Beep-beep-beep-beep.*

A needle’s bite.

Cold fluid flooding my veins.

*“V-fib converting! Don’t stop compressions!”*

The shorter one flipped me onto my stomach**, pinning me as the wings twitched to life—their grotesque sinews knotting themselves into muscle and bone. He plunged a scalpel deep into my sternum. Light—my light—gushed out in torrents, pooling on the slab before evaporating into hungry glyphs.

*“TAKE IT!”* he howled, claws raking at my chest.

The taller one’s hands melted through my ribs like liquid mercury, grasping for the core of my soul-light. *“It’s rooted—he’s fighting us!”*

The shorter one’s face unraveled**—jaw unhinging; teeth splintering into glass shards; tongue elongating into a proboscis that stabbed toward my eye. *“You’ll crawl back,”* he hissed through his disintegrating grin. *“We’ll carve you out of that meatsack—we’ll—”*

---

*Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.*

Steady now. Relentless.

*“Pulse stabilizing!”*

*“James? Squeeze my hand!”*

---

The white room shattered**.

Eyes burst like overripe fruit.

Wings crumbled to carcinogenic dust.

The men’s screams faded—not into silence but into something more human, the wail of a heart monitor.

---

**Darkness**.

Then—

**Weight**.

**Heat**.

**A throat raw from screaming**.

Fingers gripping mine tightly now—a tether pulling me back from oblivion.

*“Welcome back James”*

A face swam into focus—a man in blue scrubs, his features softened by the halo of fluorescent lights above. His stethoscope gleamed cold against his chest, and his breath smelled of spearmint gum and exhaustion. Behind him, monitors chirped arrhythmically, their screens casting jagged green shadows over the walls. My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth, cotton-dry, as I tried to speak.

“You’re a miracle!” The doctor’s voice cracked with a mix of awe and sleep deprivation. His pupils dilated slightly as he said it, as though even he didn’t believe his own words. A nurse hovered behind him, adjusting an IV bag with hands still trembling from the adrenaline of revival.

Reality seeped back in layers. The beep of the heart monitor synced with my pulse—*alive, alive, alive*. The starch-stiff sheets chafed my arms. The scent of antiseptic burned my nostrils. I clawed at the neck of my gown, gasping, expecting wings to burst from my back or golden ropes to snake around my wrists. But there was only the drip of the IV, the flicker of a muted TV in the corner, and the distant wail of a code blue over the hospital PA.

Weeks dissolved into a haze of needle sticks and midnight panic attacks. ICU nights blurred into rehab mornings; my legs trembled like a fawn’s as I relearned stairs that now seemed to warp like Anamoní’s horizon. The cardiologist’s words played on loop during treadmill sessions: *“Ventricular fibrillation… chaotic electrical impulses…”* He traced my EKG with a manicured nail, oblivious to how its glyph-like squiggles made me vomit into biohazard bins. *“No blood flow for 10 minutes—miraculous you’re here.”* I nodded absently, fingering the new scar on my sternum—a raised star-shaped keloid no surgeon could explain.

I never spoke of the eyes. The throne. The thing that called itself an angel.

*They’d lock you up,* whispered shadows pooling beneath fluorescent lights during sleepless nights.

*They’ll say it’s hypoxia,* hissed MRI machines as they scanned me for damage they couldn’t see.

So I let them chart my “PTSD” and “ICU delirium,” swallowing pills that made everything gauzy and dull.

To anyone reading this:

Heaven is not what they told us.

It’s not gates or gold or glory—it’s machinery.

Anamoní is its waiting room.

If you see the throne… if you see wings… if men with oil-slick eyes whisper your name—

**Run.**

**Fight.**

**Let your soul burn out before they can siphon it dry.**

Better to fade into purgatory’s static than fuel their gilded eternity.

I know how it sounds.

I know what you’ll say.

But lean close—I’ll show you the scars where they tried to carve me open…  

how it glows in the dark at 10:00 PM.

Its sleek, modern design and compact size immediately caught my attention. Measuring just 0.78 inches in depth and weighing less than a pound, it sits unobtrusively on my cluttered workspace. The build quality feels solid, with durable ABS material ensuring it can handle frequent use. Though it’s marketed as portable, it’s worth noting that it needs to remain plugged in, which limits its portability to places with available power outlets.

The light intensity of up to 16,000 lux is impressive, especially for combating the gloomy feel of winter days. Its three adjustable color temperatures (white, natural, and warm light) let me choose the ambiance I need at any given time. For instance, I often start my mornings with the bright white light to mimic sunlight and energize myself. The stepless brightness adjustment is a fantastic feature, allowing fine-tuning to match the mood or task.

[Check Fitfirst YG20 price on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/product/fitfirst-yg20-review-portable-lamp-analysis-b07xxngc19/)

The controls, however, took some getting used to. They are touch-sensitive, which adds a sleek, minimalist aesthetic, but the white-on-white design makes them nearly invisible. I often find myself fumbling to adjust settings, especially when the lamp is already on. Another minor gripe is the short cord length, making placement a bit tricky unless you have an extension cable or a nearby outlet.

Using the lamp daily has been a game-changer, especially during the short, dark days of winter. My coworker, who also struggles with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), borrowed it for a week and immediately noticed a difference in mood and energy levels. She mentioned how the timer function, which can be set between 10 and 60 minutes, was a convenient addition for short sessions during her coffee breaks.

**Pros**

* Compact and lightweight design, easy to place on any table.
* High-intensity light (up to 16,000 lux) effective for SAD therapy.
* Adjustable color temperatures and brightness for customization.
* Timer and memory functions for added convenience.
* Durable material and flicker-free lighting for comfort.

**Cons**

* Cord length is too short for flexible placement.
* Controls are hard to see due to white-on-white design.
* Requires constant plugging in, limiting true portability.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other light therapy lamps, the Fitfirst YG20 stands out for its high lux rating and customization options. Competitors like the Verilux HappyLight offer similar brightness levels but often lack the range of color temperature options. The HappyLight, however, does have a more user-friendly control interface. Another contender, the Circadian Optics Lamp, boasts a sharper modern design but comes at a higher price point with fewer adjustable features. Where the Fitfirst excels is its stepless dimming and memory function, which are not always standard in other models.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Considering its price, the Fitfirst YG20 offers excellent value. It provides high-end features like full-spectrum lighting, multiple settings, and portability without breaking the bank. While there are cheaper options, they often compromise on build quality or brightness levels. For anyone looking for an effective and budget-friendly light therapy lamp, this model is a strong contender.

The Fitfirst YG20 has become a staple in my daily routine, and I’d recommend it to anyone in need of a little extra brightness during dark days. For its price and features, it’s hard to beat.

Is it expensive or not? I wouldn't say I wanna go out every single day but lets say I did.. How much would that cost per month? What are your experiences and estimates?

How much would I need to live ""comfortably""

Grades: My concern is; I keep hearing many A-students in HS often drop in grades when they continue their university/undergrad studies. Does this happen more often than not at ASU? obviously I am gonna try my best and study, but what's likely (based on what you saw from students or yourself)

I’m torn between staying in the city, where I enjoy my current lifestyle, or moving back to my hometown to be with my family while waiting for my visa to work abroad.

Context:
I’m currently working as a nurse in the city. The pay is very basic, and I’m living paycheck to paycheck, but I love the convenience of city life—going to coffee shops, malls, and having everything within reach. My parents, however, are getting older, and I want to spend more time with them. If I move back to my hometown, I could work in our local government hospital, where the pay is slightly lower, but I wouldn’t have to pay rent, so I could save more.

The problem is, I don’t have friends in my hometown, and I feel like I don’t belong in a small town. Moving back would also mean an 8-hour long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (who is supportive), and I know I’d miss the social life I have in the city. On top of that, I worked hard to get into my current hospital, and it wouldn’t be easy to return if I change my mind.

My gut tells me to go home, and my plan is to move back in six months when my apartment contract ends—if there’s an opening in my hometown’s hospital. But I’m still conflicted.

Previous Attempt:
I considered finding a middle ground, like taking an extended break to test living back home, but my hospital won’t allow that. I also thought about just visiting my parents more often, but I feel like that’s not enough. Now, I’m leaning toward moving back but worried about how I’ll adjust.

Has anyone here gone through something similar? Was it worth trading city life for family? How did you handle the transition? Any advice would be appreciated!",1,1739207349.0,adviceph,2,1.0,False
1imb5cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1imb5cw/for_you/,For you,"I think of you every single day. It's been over a year since we've spoken to one another, but you are on my mind and even in my dreams. It's a cold feeling to wake up and start the day to your conscious mind leaving the dream world and the reality of having lost you being the first thoughts of the day that fill me with dread, sadness, hopelessness and regret. 

I am not able to reach out to you because I don't know what to say. I am haunted by what happened and believe this is something I will carry with me forever. Especially since it is my fault. I said mean things, terrible things, that I should not have. I made things worse. I have to live with that, and I am doing to clean and sober which adds to the day to day heaviness as I am aware of the ease in which I could throw my sobriety away simply not to feel or deal with it and in doing so, leave it unresolved to deal with years later. 

When this originally happened, I was really losing my mind and it is a shock and miracle that I decided to not use and have 30 months clean. It is something that I think about but quickly decide against because it is the only thing that I have. I fought for it, and a large part of doing it was to experience love in my life again. Which is why I reached out to begin with. 

To say you were the love of my life would be an understatement. You're the only one I ever loved period. The only one with the capability of moving me by just looking at me. The only person I ever met capable of turning emotion and feelings into something tangible and make it real with a kiss or just having your presence around me. You're a spectacular lover and I miss your soft sweet voice, your kindness, how sweet you are, and even when you're mad and yell at me for doing something stupid. I miss most is how little you are and how you have to press your toes to the ground to tiptoe kiss me. I really really miss those. 

I had everything and I fucked it all up. With time has come clarity that I just didn't have then and looking back, I can't believe at how I acted, how ashamed I am of that behavior and the guilt from that alone is a gut punch to the stomach and I'm ashamed it ever happened. In fact, I hate myself for it. 
I often think of how horrible I feel and that it all stems from the situation in which I lost and fell out of contact with you and realize that if I feel this awful, that whatever you were feeling and went through because of me had to have been a lot worse. 

Everyday I ask myself 
What the fuck have I done? What the fuck did I do?
It's relived over and over again. 

We had known one another for a long time. I am unsure if this is something that I can fix, but am sure that if it is possible that I will find a way do so. It was amazing to have seen you again after so long. To love you again. To start my day by drinking coffee and you being a big part of my morning. To ending every day with goodnight. This was all I wanted in the world. For so long. I had it. And I managed to fuck it all up. That haunts me. 

I just wanted to start my day since I woke up with you on my mind by reminding you that you are loved. Sorely missed. And I don't think you will ever be lonely and I'm grateful for that. I can't believe I ever let myself act so stupidly. That I should have listened to you. You have years of life on me and I was arrogant and foolish to not listen to you and just calm down and chill out. Had I done that, I'd have those little things in my life that I miss those most. The things that pass you by. The things that eat you alive. The little things. 

The way you reach over in the car and wrap your little hand in mine (that is always cold for some reason) 
The way that just having you present in my life was enough to bring joy to an otherwise lonely and empty place. 
You really were and are everything to me. You always have been. Its safe to say you always will be. I think of communicating all the time but stop myself short. As not to bother someone who doesn't want to be bothered. To show you I can be good and honor your wishes no matter what they may be, even if it's never seeing or hearing from me again or communicating directly from my end. 

I just worry. I wonder if you are okay and you are safe and how you are doing. I have a real fear that time and life will happen and I will just find out something happened to you by searching your name some day and come across an obituary post. How heartbreaking that would be. Especially after knowing how short and finite life is from my own experiences being the exact reason I had originally reached out to begin with. 
That I was grown up now and that I missed you. That it would be terrible to have so much unfinished business with you that I had every intention of completing and living and I reached out and you were receptive to it and treated me as if this connection was still alive in both of us, and I had that and everything I ever dreamt of having for so long and fucked it all up. 

I hate myself for it. I don't want to feel it, but running away from how I feel is what got me drugged out to begin with and I never ever want to return to that place again and have all my life's problems just left right where I left them. I believe in dealing with things and working them out if possible. I believe in addressing things and not running away or not dealing with them. I can say truthfully that I feel horrible over all that happened. That is was my fault. But I am not ever going to be ashamed or deny that I love you. 
It matters not where you may be, who you are with, that I just wish to know you were safe and okay. 

That I wish I could communicate with someone I knew since I was a teenager. That I loved from those days to these. Who means the world to me and I found salvation and kindness in that i hadn't felt in years. 

You are missed. You are loved. You were never an enigma to me. I always knew you. Because I fell in love with you -the person- and I cherished our years together and the fact you are beautiful is only an added plus because the connection I have always felt with you was always a strong one and still do this day, as I had for years, I dream of you. That I understand you and see you for you and love you as you are. That it mattered not to me what you ever did or didn't do because nothing you could do that would make me hate you. Nothing you could do that make me ashamed to have known you and loved you. 

The silence is bitter at times but I deserve it, and if it makes you feel better to know that I am indeed hurt at the loss of the most amazing woman I've ever met, then now you know. You are and always will be a part or me. Perhaps the best part of me. I had desired above all else, to receive your love in my life again. For you to be the free spirited woman you are and always have been, and to live your life with high hopes you would choose to be a part of mine. 

Looking back has given me incredible perspective as to how none of what I was upset about even mattered. All that mattered was that you had found me, loved me, were good to me and I am thinking of how amazing it is to be loved and appreciated by someone you love. To have the ability to reach out and touch them. To text them and see how they are doing. How incredibly horrific the alternative is and what a lonely place it is where hopes and dreams are the only things that seem to keep me going. 

If there is a way, i will find it. If there is not, then I will likely pay for the rest of my life in feeling truly terrible and heartbroken thinking of what things could have been and how I experienced with ease the way in which two people who lived enough life with one another can connect on a deep level and the connection is what I miss most it seems that without it I've come to realize how lonely, unappreciated and isolated I feel from the world.

Hi, My name is Vincent, and a week ago, my oldest friend died. The cops ruled it our as suicide. I don’t buy it. Me and Elliot have been friends since we were kids—him, the quiet genius; me, the one who always got us into trouble. We drifted apart over the years, the way people do when life starts pulling at the seams. But no matter how much time passed, I always figured he’d be around.

Then one day, he wasn’t. The day of his funeral will haunt me forever. Not because of his mother’s sobs or the angry red marks on his throat where the rope had bitten deep. No, what stayed with me was his face—frozen in time, almost… at peace. He looked calm. Too calm. Like he'd just dozed off and would wake up any second now. But no one who dies like that should look so… content. No forensic evidence. No signs of struggle. No note. Case closed before it even began. Just another lonely man who couldn’t take it anymore. That’s what they told his mother. That’s what they told me. Sleep never came that night. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for answers that never came. The silence of my apartment felt too heavy, like something pressing down on my chest. The nightmares started the following night and haven’t left me since. I see myself in his tiny apartment, my hands gripping his arms, trying to hold him up, trying to undo what’s already been done. But his body is limp, slipping through my fingers like sand. His eyes are open. Watching me. And then I wake up. My phone rang. I knew that voice too well, but this morning it sounded different. It was Elliot’s mother.

My phone rang, Barbara Grayson. I knew that voice too well, but tonight it sounded different.

""Vince? Hope I didn’t wake you, sweetheart.""

""No, Barbara."" I said, struggling to keep my voice steady. It was always hard to sound awake on the other end of the line when the night had swallowed me whole. ""What’s the matter?""

""Vince,"" she paused, voice cracking slightly, like she was testing whether or not she could trust me with what she was about to say.

""I’ve been going through some of Elliot’s things. I found something strange. I... I need you to see it.""After a few failed attempts to get her to give me more details over the phone, I decided to go over and see what she meant.I grabbed my jacket from the hook by the door, taking one last look at the quiet apartment. As I stepped into the kitchen to grab my keys, I froze.

There, on the floor, was a shard of glass—broken and jagged. The faint smell of old coffee mixed with the sharp, metallic scent of the glass. My heart skipped a beat.

I bent down to inspect it, a bit groggy still from the restless sleep. I thought maybe I had knocked it over in the night while stumbling around in a half-sleep state, trying to get a glass of water. I haven’t given it too much taught at the time. Just another detail lost in the fog of bad dreams. I rushed to his apartment, my hands sweaty on the steering wheel. My mind was going all sorts of irrational places, mostly due to the nightmares, but it had to be just an old photo or some memento she would want me to have. Yet something felt wrong in my gut. After a few failed attempts to get more details out of her, I threw caution to the wind and rushed to his apartment. My hands gripped the steering wheel, slick with sweat, heart racing in a way I couldn’t explain. My mind was spiraling, jumping to irrational conclusions—the nightmares were wearing me down, messing with my head. But it had to be something simple, just an old photo or a memento she wanted me to have. Still, something gnawed at me, deep in my gut, telling me it wasn’t.

Each turn only deepened the dread crawling up my spine. What could she have found that was so important? I’d known Elliot for years—there shouldn’t be any secrets. So why the hell did it feel like I was heading straight into something I couldn’t see, something waiting for me? Once at the apartment, I hesitated at the door. I knew Elliot’s familiar face and tired smile wouldn’t be waiting to greet me. That thought made my chest tighten, but I shook it off. I wasn’t here for memories anymore. I pushed the door open, deciding to let myself in.

Barbara was sitting on the couch, clutching a tiny notebook in her hands. She looked like she hadn't moved much since the funeral, as if her whole world had shrunk to this small apartment. We shared a few quiet words, exchanging memories that felt too distant, too hollow. Then, the air shifted.

“I found this in his nightstand,” Barbara said, her voice soft but strained. “The first page said it’s meant for you to read... and I wouldn’t want to go against his wishes. ”I grasped the notebook, feeling the weight of it in my hands. I gave Barbara a long look before flipping to the first page. The ink looked fresh, as if it had been written recently, after everything else.

“For Vincent.”

The words seemed to burn into my mind, the finality of them unsettling. I turned the page.

It didn’t take long to figure out the purpose of the notebook. The first entry was dated October 23rd, 2021. It was a dream journal.

I glanced up at Barbara, the realization settling heavy in my chest. I shared the discovery with her, and her face flickered through a mix of emotions—sadness, confusion, disappointment. Her lips tightened, as if she had been hoping for something different, something easier to understand.

“I was hoping…” she trailed off, her voice barely above a whisper, “I was hoping there’d be something else. A reason. A motive.”

I didn’t have an answer for her. I could feel the weight of her expectation pressing down. ""I’ll read through it and let you know if I find anything, Barbara.” I said, standing up. “I need to get to work.”

She gave me an understanding nod and, after a moment, invited me over for dinner one of these days.

As I mentioned in the title, I’m a private investigator. It sounds glamorous to some, but in reality, the job is often slow, repetitive, and draining. Most of my days are spent in my car, tailing cheating spouses, snapping photos, or digging through social media profiles. Today was no different. The case I was working on wasn’t anything special—just another husband hiding something from his wife.

But as I sat in my car, waiting for my subject to show up, I pulled the journal from my bag and flipped it open, letting the words take me somewhere else for a little while. I gave the first few dreams a bit too much thought, trying to interpret whatever was going on in Elliot’s life, and reading everything three times. I quickly came to the conclusion that this was nothing special, so I just kept reading it as if everything was normal. 

I kept flipping through the pages, reading each entry casually, until I reached January 5th, 2022. The words on the page hit me like a cold slap.

“In tonight’s dream, I was wandering through my friend Vincent’s apartment. I saw him in his bedroom, sleeping, distressed. I decided to leave, knocking down a coffee mug on my way out. The dream ends.”",15,1739207280.0,nosleep,4,1.0,False

\---------------------------------------------------------

The following day found the lecture hall humming with subdued energy. A mix of idle discussions, rustling papers, and the occasional buzz of a phone vibrating against a desk. Lucas Voss stood at the front of the room, his laptop casting a faint glow onto his face as he scrolled through his notes. The day’s topic—adaptive radiation—felt ironic. He shook his head. He needed to focus. His lectures had been the same for the last ten years, today would be no different.

“Good afternoon, everyone,” he began, his voice cutting through his students' chatter. The room quieted, and dozens of faces turned toward him. He clicked to the first slide, displaying a colorful diagram of Darwin’s finches. “Today, we’re diving into adaptive radiation—how species evolve and diversify in response to ecological opportunities.”

Lucas gestured toward the screen. “You’ve probably seen this example before: Darwin’s finches on the Galápagos Islands. Over time, these birds developed different beak shapes and sizes depending on their ecological niches. Some beaks are suited for cracking seeds, others for catching insects or sipping nectar. This diversity has allowed them to exploit resources that other species couldn't.""

A hand shot up in the second row. It was Erin, a relatively attentive sophomore. Lucas always appreciated her questions. “Dr. Voss, could adaptive radiation apply to humans? I mean, with how we’ve changed the environment to suit our needs, haven’t we kind of radiated ourselves?”

Lucas paused for a moment. Erin was clearly reaching for something. “Intersting concept, Erin. Humans have indeed modified our environments extensively. In some ways, we’ve created niches for ourselves—think of urban versus rural lifestyles, or even the microclimates within cities. However, adaptive radiation usually refers to a single species diverging into multiple specialized forms. For us, cultural and technological evolution has played a bigger role than any type of physical divergence. Granted, applying adaptive radiation to environments over species is an interesting concept.”

Erin nodded, she was about to open her mouth for a follow up but was interrupted by another hand shooting up in the back. It was Matt, one of the quieter students. “Dr. Voss, does that mean what’s happening in the city… you know, the changes people are talking about—could that be a new type of rapid adaptive radiation? Just done a little differently?”

Lucas froze for a fraction of a second, his mind racing to formulate a response. “What changes are you referring to, Matt?”

“You know, the weird stuff. Everyone's talking about it. My mom said the trees in Grant Park look like they’re sprouting up out of nothing, and their bark’s all wrong—like it’s… soft. And she swore she saw one with this weird imprint on the trunk.” He glanced around, clearly uncertain whether he should continue. “I thought it was just her, but then I saw a plant near my apartment that looked… fleshy. Could that be something to look out for?”

The air in the room shifted as murmurs spread among the students. Lucas cleared his throat, trying to steady himself. “Those are good observations, Matt. Plants can respond to environmental changes—pollution, soil composition, even water availability—in ways that might seem strange to us. It’s not necessarily evolution, though. It could just be phenotypic plasticity. It's definitely interesting enough to keep an eye on though.”

A girl near the middle row raised her hand tentatively. “But it’s not just plants, right? My uncle’s a doctor at Northwestern, and he says they’re seeing an increase in patients with weird growths, kind of like Matt's plants. Like—really odd stuff that doesn’t make sense. He didn’t tell me much, but he looked worried when he brought it up.”

The murmurs grew louder, and Lucas felt the weight of their questions pressing down on him. He forced a calm smile and raised a hand to quiet the room. ""Alright, for now, let's stick to the topic at hand, and keep in mind that adaptive radiation is a slow process, not something you’d expect to see overnight. Whatever you're seeing out there is most likely a case of apophenia. Everyone is just getting caught up in a loop of self proving observations.”

“But isn't what you and Dr. Cho are studying related to all this stuff?” Erin asked, her voice cutting through the lecture hall. She had finally got her question out. “Tessa said you’ve been looking at changes in the city—cells or something. Are those connected to this?”

Lucas inwardly cursed his loose-lipped graduate assistant. It was no wonder why his students weren't letting this topic go, they had an angle on him. “What Dr. Cho and I are studying is highly preliminary. We’ve collected some environmental samples showing interesting properties, but it’s too early to draw any major conclusions apart from some simple speculations.”

Another hand shot up, this time from a boy with a mop of curly hair. “Interesting properties like what? Are we just talking about crazy plants, or are we getting into weird mutant freaks territory?”

The class laughed nervously, but the tension was simmering under the noise. Lucas leaned on the podium, choosing his words carefully. “We’re seeing unusual adaptability, which is why we’re studying it. But I need to stress that what’s happening—if it’s happening—isn’t cause for alarm. We haven't seen any evidence of anything physically affecting people. Science often uncovers strange phenomena that turn out to have simple explanations.”

“Simple explanations?” Erin’s voice was tinged with skepticism. “Dr. Voss, you’re telling us not to panic, but my cousin said her boss’s dog grew these weird patches of… I don’t know, meat, but it wasn’t skin. She said it looked like it had these weird ridges on them. And those grew overnight. How can you explain that?”

Lucas hesitated. He debated offering some sort of response, but revealing anything would only add fuel to the fire. “I can’t speak to secondhand accounts,” he said carefully. “But I can promise you that every anomaly we encounter is being studied thoroughly.”

The class quieted, though the air remained heavy. Lucas clicked to the next slide, an image of cichlid fish from Africa’s Great Lakes. “Let’s pivot back to today’s topic, please.” He took a long breath. “Adaptive radiation can be seen in aquatic ecosystems. These cichlids have diversified into hundreds of species, each specializing in different feeding strategies, habitats, and behaviors. This diversification allowed them to thrive without outcompeting one another.”

“Why are you so against us talking about this? It's all over the news.” Matt interrupted, his voice more insistent. “Besides, it seems pretty on topic. If the city’s environment is changing, like Erin brought up, wouldn’t everything—plants, animals, even us—have to adapt? Like, fast?”

Lucas gripped the edge of the podium, feeling the tension in the room tighten like a coiled spring. “Adapting quickly isn’t typical for most organisms,” he said, his voice even. “Changes like those you’re describing—if they’re real—are rare and take time to fully understand. When things mutate quickly, it tends to be cancerous. Not evolutionary. The most important thing we can do is avoid jumping to conclusions and stop chalking random mutations into a coordinated evolutional pattern.”

A girl in the back muttered something to her friend next to her, but her words carried: “He’s not actually saying it’s impossible, though.”

Lucas took a deep breath, controlling the simmer in his tone. “Science thrives on evidence,” he said, addressing the room. “Right now, we don’t have enough to draw a clear picture. Speculation is natural, but it’s not the same as proof.”

Another hand went up—Sara, another quiet student who rarely spoke. “What if you’re wrong and it is starting to affect people? My dad’s been acting strange lately—he keeps talking about feeling like something’s ‘pulling’ at him. And he’s not the only one. Could this… whatever it is… be showing itself with mental changes? Before it becomes physical?”

The question hung in the air like a ball of static. Lucas felt his pulse quicken but forced himself to maintain his composure. “Changes in behavior could have many causes,” he said carefully. “Stress, environmental factors, even diet. You know that. It’s important not to attribute everything to one idea. If your dad is experiencing any type of psychosis, I recommend taking him to a doctor for a proper checkup. At least prior to prescribing any type of theoretical science to his symptoms.”

“Isn’t that exactly what popular scientists say to do before major discoveries happen?” Erin countered. “That people were imagining things? That they were just seeing things they wanted to see?”

Lucas met her gaze, his forced composure wavering for a moment. “Skepticism is the cornerstone of science,” he said. “It ensures that when we do make claims, they’re backed by rigorous evidence.”

The room fell into an uneasy silence. Lucas could feel the students’ eyes on him, a mix of curiosity, fear, and doubt radiating off of them like heat. He clicked to the next slide, a summary of his lessons key points, and straightened up his posture.

“Let’s wrap up with this,” he said, before continuing with his lecture.

After the lesson, the students began packing their things, the murmur of conversation rising again. Lucas scanned the room, noting the blatant stress on their faces. As the crowd thinned, Erin approached the podium.

“Dr. Voss,” she said hesitantly, “I didn’t mean to push earlier. It’s just… people are scared. And you seem like you know more than you’re saying.”

Lucas sighed, leaning on the podium. “I’m not trying to withhold information, Erin. I just want to avoid panicking people before we have all the facts. Right now, I haven't seen anything that warrants scaring anyone.”

She nodded slowly but didn’t look entirely convinced. “If you find something… bad, you’ll tell us, right?”

Lucas met her gaze. “You’ll be the first to know.”

As Erin walked away, Lucas let out a long breath and stared at the now-empty lecture hall. He didn't know how much of what he said was the truth, and how much of it was a lie. 

He glanced at his laptop, its screen still displaying the colorful diagram of Darwin’s finches. He frowned before closing the laptop and heading towards the door. 

There would be no lab work today. He was graced with that much.

\---

The voicemail arrived that night at 2:37 a.m.

Lucas was half-asleep, caught in that liminal space where dreams and reality bled together, when the faint vibration of his phone stirred him. He groaned, rolling over, his hand fumbling across the nightstand. His fingers brushed against a paperback, an empty glass, and finally the cool edge of his phone. The screen’s glow seared through the dark like an unwanted glare, and he squinted at it.

**Evelyn.**

He sighed, irritated but not surprised. She’d called late before—never at this hour, but often enough that he knew her tendencies to get lost in her work. “Boundaries, Evelyn,” he muttered groggily, letting the phone ring itself out. He dropped it back onto the table, turned over, and sank back into his pillow. The room fell silent again, the faint hum of the city outside lulling him into another uneasy night of sleep.

By morning, he had almost forgotten the call. The sky was a slate gray, the kind of overcast that soaked the city in dim, unmotivated light. It had been raining a lot the last few days, Lucas noted. He shuffled into his kitchen, rubbing the back of his neck as he yawned. The chipped coffee mug on the counter was the first thing he reached for, and he poured the last of his dwindling grounds into the machine, its sputtering hiss the only sound in the apartment.

It wasn’t until he reached for his phone—out of habit more than intention—that he noticed the voicemail notification. The screen read **1 New Voice Message**, Evelyn’s name hovering above it. A faint stirring puttered in his chest, but he told himself it was nothing. Evelyn probably had some breakthrough at the lab. Another late-night epiphany she couldn’t keep to herself. He hit play.

The beep preceded her voice.

“Lucas.” The word came sharp and trembling, her tone frayed and too fast. “I’ve seen it. I’ve seen—it’s not what we thought. It’s everything. I can’t—I can’t explain, but you have to understand—I have to tell them.”

There was a pause, the faint crackle of static on the line punctuated by a long, uneven breath. She sounded as though she’d been running—or crying.

“It’s everywhere, Lucas. And it’s starting. You’ll see soon. You’ll see everything.”

Another pause. Static, faint murmurs in the background that could have been wind or something else entirely. Then her voice returned, softer, almost a whisper: “Don’t try to find me.”

The voicemail ended abruptly.

Lucas stared at his phone, his breath caught in his chest. The mug hovered in his hand, forgotten. The message replayed in his mind, looping, tangled, the weight of her words pressing down on him. His stomach tightened as unease bloomed into dread. This wasn’t like Evelyn. She could be intense, obsessive even, but not frantic. Not incoherent.

“Damn it, Evelyn,” he muttered under his breath, setting the mug down with a clatter. He replayed the message, this time focusing on the background noises, straining for clues. The faint murmurs carried no context, no clarity. The static hissed like distant waves. He hit pause, gripping the edge of the counter, the cool laminate grounding him against the rising tide of panic.

He hit the call button, the screen flashing her name. The line rang twice before going straight to voicemail. “Evelyn, it’s Lucas,” he said after the beep. “I got your message. Call me back when you can. I’m serious.” He hesitated, then added, “I’m worried about you.”

He hung up and stared at the phone as if willing it to vibrate with her response. It didn’t. The screen went dark, his reflection ghosting across it. He dialed again, and again it went straight to voicemail.

Her phone was off.

Lucas set the phone down, his mind racing. Evelyn wasn’t the kind of person to disappear. She thrived on routine—her late nights in the lab, her carefully cataloged notebooks, her habitual orders from the same takeout places. Her message, however disjointed, wasn’t just a cry for help. It was a warning.

He rubbed his temples, the remnants of his sleep being quickly forced off of him, though his thoughts were still sluggishly trying to keep up. He replayed her words in his mind: *It’s everywhere. And it’s starting.*

He glanced at a framed photo on his bookshelf—Evelyn and him, years ago, standing in front of a conference banner with awkward smiles. She was younger then, her hair neat and her expression determined, already driven by the relentless curiosity that had defined her career. That version of Evelyn would never leave a message like this.

Lucas leaned back, rubbing his face with his hands. His mind cycled through the possibilities: was she in trouble? Was it exhaustion? Or worse—was she right? Was something truly happening?

The questions piled on top of one another, each heavier than the last. He grabbed his mug, draining the lukewarm coffee in one long gulp before heading to the bedroom to dress. His routine felt mechanical: dark jeans, a gray button-down, the same jacket he wore to the university every day. He grabbed his satchel, double-checking its contents—laptop, notes, a folder of graded papers—and slung it over his shoulder. The usual rhythm of his morning felt offbeat, like a song playing out of tune.

He stopped at the door, his hand on the knob. Something gnawed at him, an irrational pull to turn back, to comb through her voicemail again or try calling her once more. He shook his head, forcing the thought away. The university wasn’t far. If she wasn’t answering her phone, she’d likely gone back to work, consumed by whatever revelation that had sparked her message.

“Get a grip,” he muttered to himself, the sound of his voice too loud in the quiet apartment. He pulled the door open, stepping into the hallway. The building’s fluorescent lighting buzzed faintly, and the scent of bleach from the morning cleaners lingered in the air. 

He descended the stairs two at a time, his mind already running ahead to the lab, to Evelyn, to the growing certainty that whatever was happening wasn’t just in their heads.

It was everywhere else.

\---

The university campus felt unnervingly off that morning. A faint drizzle misted the sidewalks, glinting under a weak sun that was smothered by dense gray clouds. Students and faculty hurried between buildings, heads down, conversations subdued to a murmur.

Lucas Voss adjusted the strap of his bag and quickened his pace, his gaze scanning the familiar paths with growing apprehension. His thoughts looped endlessly back to Evelyn’s voicemail, the frantic edge in her voice, the breathless words: *“Don’t try to find me.”* But he couldn’t leave it alone—not after hearing her desperation. Not after being the one she’d chosen to call.

The corridor to Lab 3C was empty, the usual chatter of graduate assistants and technicians eerily absent. Even the hum of distant machinery seemed muted, swallowed by the sterile silence of the building. Lucas slowed as he approached the lab’s door, which hung slightly ajar. He had to remind himself it wouldn't have been the first time within the last week that she had left it open. 

But something felt different. Something was wrong.

He pushed the door open cautiously. The sight stopped him cold.

The lab was a disaster.

Equipment was scattered across counters, some smashed on the floor. Papers were shredded, torn diagrams curling like wilted leaves among shards of glass. The whiteboard, usually filled with Evelyn’s meticulous notes, was wiped almost clean, faint smudges of colored ink hinting at the erasure of something important. Cables hung limp from monitors, their screens dark, and drawers gaped open like silent mouths.

Lucas stepped inside, the crunch of glass under his shoes loud in the oppressive quiet. The air smelled of ethanol and something acidic, faint but acrid, like wet metal. His pulse quickened as his eyes scanned the destruction. The chaos seemed like a controlled burn, not a wildfire. This wasn’t a break-in. This was purposeful.

“Evelyn?” His voice echoed faintly, but the room swallowed it.

There was no answer.

He moved deeper into the wreckage, his hands shaking as he steadied himself on a counter. Her desk was barren—its usual clutter of notes, coffee cups, and pens reduced to a few stray sticky notes and an overturned mug. The drawers were empty, their contents hastily dumped or removed. Lucas crouched, his fingers brushing against a crumpled sheet of paper on the floor. Blank. Beneath it, something glinted faintly in the mess—a USB drive, half-hidden among tangled wires.

He picked it up and turned it over in his hand. There was no label, nothing to hint at its contents. Instinctively, he slipped it into his pocket.

“What the hell were you doing, Evelyn?” he muttered, straightening. His eyes swept the room again, searching for some clue she might have left behind. But the destruction was almost surgical, leaving no trace of her work—or her whereabouts.

His phone buzzed in his pocket, making him jump. He pulled it out, glancing at the screen. Tessa.

“Hey,” he answered, his voice low. “I’m in the lab.”

“Is Evelyn there?” Tessa’s voice was sharp. “She hasn’t been answering my calls, I need to know what supplies she needs me to pick up.”

“She’s not here,” Lucas replied, glancing around the room again. “And from the looks of it, she’s not going to be around for a while.”

There was a pause on the other end. “What do you mean?”

“The lab’s trashed. Not just cluttered—it’s cleared out. She took everything. Notes, hard drives, equipment. It’s like she didn’t want anyone else to see what she was working on.”

“That doesn’t make sense,” Tessa said, her tone softer now but no less anxious. “She’s been practically living in that lab for the last few days. Why would she just… leave?”

Lucas hesitated. “I don’t know. But she left me a voicemail last night.”

“What did she say?”

Lucas exhaled, the weight of Evelyn’s words pressing down on him again. “She said she’d seen something. That it wasn’t what we thought. And she told me not to look for her.”

There was another pause, filled only with Tessa’s shallow breath. When she spoke again, her voice barely passed above the hum of the AC. “Do you think she’s okay?”

“I don’t know,” Lucas admitted. He ran a hand through his hair, his thoughts racing. “But I need to figure out what’s going on. I found a USB. Maybe the drive has something on it.”

“You think she left it on purpose?”

“Maybe. Or maybe she just missed it when she was clearing out.” He glanced toward the door, his uncertainty growing. “Either way, it’s a lead.”

“Be careful, Lucas,” Tessa said, her voice wavering slightly. “If Evelyn’s scared, there’s a reason.”

“I know,” he said quietly. “I’ll keep you updated.”

He ended the call and slipped his phone back into his pocket, his gaze drifting over the wreckage one last time. Something nagged at him—something he couldn’t shake. Evelyn had always been meticulous, even when she was overwhelmed. This wasn’t just a rash decision done out of panic. This was calculated, purposeful. She was doing something.

Lucas crossed the room to the workbench where their samples had been stored. The locked cabinets were open, their shelves empty. The incubator stood silent, its usual hum absent. Even the microscope slides were gone, wiped clean like the whiteboard. But as Lucas ran his fingers along the edge of the counter, they caught on a faint, sticky residue. He pulled his hand back, frowning. The substance was dark, almost black, and faintly viscous, clinging to his skin like oil.

He grabbed a tissue and wiped it off, but the sensation lingered, an almost imperceptible tingling spreading across his fingertips. Lucas’s stomach turned. He’d seen that substance before—on the cells, on the spiraling patterns in their samples. It was the same. Alive, or close to it.

The faint sounds of the overhead lights seemed louder now, buzzing against the silence like a strict deterrent. Lucas swallowed hard and stepped back from the counter, his heart pounding in his chest.

He had to get out of there.

Lucas turned and made his way toward the door, his steps quick but coordinated. The knot in his stomach tightened with every crunch of glass underfoot, every creak of the empty lab around him. When he reached the hallway, he paused, glancing back at the wreckage. He let his eyes linger for a moment. 

He shook his head and turned away, stepping into the corridor, the door swinging shut behind him with a soft click. The quiet of the building pressed in around him, the muffled sounds of the outside world distant and faint. Lucas adjusted the strap of his bag and headed for the exit.

As he pushed open the heavy glass doors of the building and stepped into the damp morning air, Lucas felt the weight of the unknown settle over him. The city around him felt foreign. Larger than it should have. Impossibly vast. His eyes ran along the skyline, the towering buildings and bustling streets making him feel small. His insignificance gnawing at the back of his mind as an indelible fact.

*You could be bigger than all of this. You could matter.*

Lucas paused. He blinked. What was that voice? He looked around and didn't see anyone near him. He must've imagined it. Lucas pulled his coat tighter around his shoulders and started walking again. 

It wasn't long before Lucas took a seat at his desk, the door to his office closed and locked. The USB drive felt heavier than it should have in his palm, its small, nondescript form betraying none of the chaos it might contain. He exhaled slowly, bracing himself, and inserted it into his laptop. The drive’s contents loaded with a soft chime, and a single folder appeared on the screen: **ANOMALY\_120H**.

He opened it, his pulse quickening as he scanned the contents. Inside were dozens of files—maps, spreadsheets, graphs, and logs, all meticulously organized. At the top of the list was a document labeled **README.TXT**, the timestamp indicating it had been created less than 24 hours ago. Lucas hesitated, his fingers hovering over the trackpad, then in one motion, he double-clicked.

**Lucas,If you’re reading this, it means I’ve done something drastic. I’m sorry I didn’t explain more—there wasn’t time, and honestly, I don’t think you’d have believed me if I tried. Start with the heat maps. Look at the patterns. Then read the logs. Everything will make sense eventually. Or maybe it won’t. I’ll do my best to help.Evelyn**

The brevity of the message unnerved him. Evelyn had never been one for dramatic flourishes; her work was always grounded in precision, her notes a masterclass in clarity. But this—this was different. 

Lucas opened the first map. His breath caught as the image filled the screen—a heat map of Chicago, overlaid with a lattice of red and orange clusters radiating outward from Lake Michigan. The epicenter was unmistakable: Just east of Navy Pier. The bright red zone pulsated with a haunting intensity, the tendrils branching out like veins through the surrounding neighborhoods.

He clicked through more maps, watching the spread unfold in jagged, organic patterns. The earliest maps showed small clusters near the shoreline, but by the most recent, the anomalies had extended deep into the city. The branching structures were uncannily deliberate, as if they were seeking out something—or someone.

Next, Lucas opened a series of data logs. The entries detailed changes in the city’s environmental metrics: pH levels, oxygen content, turbidity. The fluctuations were extreme, with no clear source. Notes in Evelyn’s handwriting filled the margins:

* **“Water temp: 7°C increase in 48 hrs. Unnatural. Accelerated metabolic process?”**
* **“pH nearing 4.2 in localized areas. Acidification? Biotic cause?”**
* **“Not random. Patterns consistent with organismal spread. Intent?”**

The final log included a cryptic line that made his stomach churn: **“Atmospheric particulates show similar structuring. Spread is systemic. We are breathing it. It's in the water. It’s in the rain.”**

Lucas leaned back in his chair, his thoughts racing. His logical mind resisted the implications, grasping for explanations that didn’t spiral into paranoia. But the data was unrelenting in its precision. This wasn’t a natural phenomenon—it was a coordinated takeover.

Lucas hesitated before clicking on the last file. It was a video, labeled **FINAL\_OBS.MP4**. The timestamp indicated it had been recorded late last night, only hours before Evelyn’s voicemail. His heart pounded as the video began.

The camera was handheld, the frame shaky and close. It showed Evelyn’s face, pale and drawn, her eyes hollow but unnervingly sharp. She was in the lab, though the chaos Lucas had found earlier was already apparent. Behind her, equipment was overturned, papers scattered, and monitors dark.

“This is for you, Lucas,” she began, her voice quiet but steady. “I don’t know if I’ll be able to explain this in person. By the time you see this, you’ll understand why.” She paused, her lips pressing into a thin line before continuing. “It’s not what we thought. The cells, the patterns, the way they adapt—it’s not about survival. It’s about conversion. Integration. This thing—it’s not just alive. It’s conscious.”

Lucas’s pulse quickened. The weight of her words was suffocating, each syllable sinking deeper into his chest.

“The spread isn’t random,” Evelyn continued, her gaze flickering as though she were distracted by something just out of frame. “It’s systematic. Deliberate. It’s remaking everything—water, soil, air. Even us.”

She stopped abruptly, her eyes narrowing as though listening to something he couldn’t hear. When she spoke again, her voice had changed—calmer, almost reverent. “Do you know what it feels like, Lucas? To finally understand? It’s terrifying, yes, but also… beautiful. They’re showing me things—patterns, connections, truths that we can’t comprehend. We’re part of it. We always have been.”

Her words sent a chill down his spine. This wasn’t Evelyn—not the pragmatic, fiercely analytical scientist he knew. Something had shifted in her, something fundamental. And it happened in an instant.

“Chicago isn’t being infected,” she said, her voice softening further. “It’s being prepared. They’re weaving it into something greater. And we can’t stop it. Trying to fight this—it’s like fighting the tide. It’s already too late.”

Lucas felt a wave of nausea rise in his stomach. He wanted to stop the video, to look away, but he couldn’t. Evelyn’s expression had shifted to something almost serene, her lips curving into a faint smile.

“Don’t try to find me,” she said, echoing the words from her voicemail. “I’m where I need to be. You’ll see soon, Lucas. You’ll see everything.”

The video ended abruptly, the screen fading to black.

Lucas sat frozen, his breath shallow and his hands trembling. The room around him felt distant, the faint hum of his laptop the only sound breaking the silence. Evelyn’s words echoed in his mind, each sentence more incomprehensible than the last. *Integration. Conscious. Weaving.*

What had happened to her?

He forced himself to replay the video, his eyes scanning every detail for clues. Evelyn’s tone, her expressions—there was no mistaking her conviction. But beneath it all, he sensed something darker. It wasn’t just understanding she’d found—it was comfort.

The faint sound of footsteps outside his office startled him. He quickly minimized the video, his heart pounding as the steps passed by and faded into silence. He leaned back in his chair, running a hand across his unshaven jawline. The weight of everything pressed down on him: the data, the maps, Evelyn’s alteration. It was too much, too fast.

Lucas reopened the heat maps, his eyes darting over the branching patterns radiating out from Navy Pier. The shapes weren’t random, just like she had said; they followed a logic he couldn’t quite decipher, but it was there. The tendrils avoided certain areas—clusters of industrial zones and highways—while infiltrating others, like residential neighborhoods and public parks.

He pulled out a notebook and began sketching the patterns, his hand moving almost of its own accord. The shapes on the paper mirrored the spirals they’d seen in the lab samples, the same honeycombed structures that had twisted his dreams into nightmares.

Suddenly, his pen stopped. A thought struck him with chilling clarity: *What if the patterns weren’t just a representation of the spread? What if they were communicating?*

*Listen Lucas.*

Lucas shut the laptop and pushed back from the desk, his chest tight with panic. He needed air—needed to clear his head before he could even begin to process the implications of what he’d just seen. But as he stood, his gaze fell to his hands. They were trembling, his fingers faintly twitching in uneven rhythms.

He flexed them, trying to calm the spasms, but the motion only grew worse. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but it was there: a faint spiral forming in the muscles of his palm, tightening with each twitch.

Lucas staggered back, his breath catching in his throat. Whatever was happening—whatever Evelyn had uncovered—was already inside him.

I’m currently working as a nurse away from my hometown. The pay is very basic, and I’m living paycheck to paycheck, but I enjoy city life—I love going to coffee shops, malls, and just having everything accessible.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about moving back to my hometown to be with my family. My parents are getting older, and I want to spend more time with them. I could apply to our local government hospital, and even though the pay is slightly lower, I wouldn’t have to pay rent, so I’d actually save more while waiting for my visa to work abroad.

However, my biggest concern is losing my social life. I don’t have friends in my hometown, and moving back would mean an 8-hour long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (he’s very supportive, though). I also feel like I don’t belong in a small town, and I know I’d really miss the city life I’ve gotten used to. At the same time, I know I’ve worked hard to get into my current hospital, and going back wouldn’t be easy if I change my mind.

My gut feeling tells me to go home, and I’m planning to move back in about six months when my apartment contract expires—assuming there’s an opening in my hometown’s hospital. But I’m still torn.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Was it worth giving up city life for family? How did you adjust? Any advice would be really appreciated!",2,1739207176.0,NursesPH,2,1.0,False

Day 2: LYV to Sunrise lakes (including a trip up half dome). About 9 miles and 2500' elevation.

Day 3: Sunrise to clouds rest to cathedral lakes. About 8 miles and 1800' elevation

Day 4: Cathedral lakes back to yosemite valley. About 9 miles and -3000' elevation.

Questions:

Is this a good route?

We will have a couple of beginner backpackers in our group, will this be too challenging for them?

If we manage to score the backcountry permit, does that guarantee us a half dome permit? Or is there a chance we don't get a half dome permit?

Anything we must see or do on this route?

Okay, I’m going to be super honest here: I’m a total newbie at web design, and I just built my very first Squarespace site. Like, literally last weekend, in my pajamas, in between cups of coffee, thinking, “Maybe I can actually do this!” But now I’m experiencing that classic “I have no clue if this is good or absolute trash” feeling. So, I’m reaching out to this awesome community for some genuine, heartfelt feedback—because if anyone can set me on the right path, it’s the brilliant minds on Reddit.

Here’s my situation: I’m super passionate about all things tech, I’ve thrown together some bold colors, a funky background, a bunch of text that sounded decent in my head, and... I’m hoping it doesn’t look like a chaotic rainbow vomit to everyone else. I’m the kind of person who can get lost for hours in a color palette generator and still not know if I made the right choice. I’m second-guessing every font pair, every call-to-action placement, and basically everything else.

I’d love your honest-to-goodness critiques—no sugarcoating, please. If my layout makes your eyes bleed, I want to know. If my background is the best (or worst) you’ve ever seen, I’m begging you to tell me. Seriously, think of me as your little web design baby bird who’s trying to fly for the first time. And yes, I’m aware that might sound dramatic, but hey, that’s how it feels!

The funny part? I’ve convinced myself that the site is “kind of” okay because my best friend said, “Wow, it’s not half bad.” But we all know how friends can be: they’re sweet and supportive (which is great), but maybe they’re also blind to the flaws that a real pro would spot in half a second. Or maybe they’re just being nice so I don’t panic and delete the entire thing. Which is, I admit, an actual scenario I considered at 2 AM last night.

That’s why I need you. You’re the real deal. If you have two minutes to spare—maybe while you’re bored at work or procrastinating on something else—please click through my site, let your eyes wander, and tell me everything that pops into your mind. Don’t hold back. I’m bracing myself for tough love because that’s the only way I’ll learn. Shoot me your random thoughts, your deep dives, your “I can’t believe you chose THAT font” laments—whatever. I promise I’ll soak it all in, and I’ll be super grateful for every word.

And hey, if you happen to love it (or at least see some spark of potential), definitely share that too. I could use the hope! Seriously though, I’m standing on the ledge of web design territory, and your advice is going to be the push that either helps me grow wings or faceplant. No pressure, right?

Thank you so, SO much in advance. You have no idea how excited and nervous I am to read your responses. Let’s do this, folks. Give me all you’ve got—my future as a wannabe web designer literally depends on it!

However, now (after 3 months) occasionally I will have a coffee either with a friend when talking about work or to get lots of word done (programming) and the feeling is completely different. My mind is not lazy at all, I get many new ideas and interests popping up.

1imb179,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestCoffeeTables/comments/1imb179/yaheetech_lift_top_coffee_table_review_is_it/,Yaheetech Lift Top Coffee Table review: Is it worth your living room space?,"Testing out the Yaheetech YT-00096511-001 Lift Top Coffee Table in my living room was an interesting experience, to say the least. As someone who spends a lot of time multitasking between binge-watching Netflix, working on my laptop, and occasionally eating dinner in the same spot, this table seemed like a great addition to my space. It’s a rectangular table with an engineered wood design, featuring a lift-top mechanism, hidden storage, and a lower shelf, all finished in a modern grey veneer.

The **design and materials** of this table immediately stood out. The engineered wood construction doesn’t scream ""luxury,"" but it certainly feels more premium than some of the flimsy particleboard furniture I’ve encountered before. The grey veneer finish is smooth and modern, blending seamlessly with my minimalist decor. However, the corners of the tabletop are not as durable as I had hoped. A small chip appeared during assembly, which might be a concern for households with kids or pets.

Its **dimensions**—41 inches in length, 19.5 inches in width, and a height range of 19.2 to 24.2 inches—make it practical for both small apartments and larger living rooms. The lift-top mechanism is particularly useful. I found myself using it to raise the table to a comfortable height for typing on my laptop or enjoying a meal without hunching over. That said, the hinges could have been sturdier; lifting the top needs a bit of care to prevent wobbling, especially when pulling it from the sides.

**Storage space** is where this coffee table truly shines. The hidden compartment beneath the lift-top is spacious enough to stash away remote controls, my laptop, and even a few books. The lower shelf adds even more room for decorative items or additional storage boxes. However, the table’s load-bearing capacity of 44 pounds is somewhat limiting. For those like me who are prone to stacking everything they own onto a table, this is something to keep in mind.

Cleaning this table has been relatively easy. Its laminated surface resists stains to some extent, but scratches are a different story. A careless swipe with a rough cloth left a faint mark, so I’ve started using microfiber cloths for maintenance. On the plus side, the smooth finish makes wiping off crumbs or spills from late-night snacking a breeze.

Assembling the table was an adventure. The instruction manual was clear for the most part, but attaching the lift-top mechanism required some ingenuity. With only a screwdriver in hand and no extra set of hands, aligning the gas rods with the hinges took more effort than expected. This step might be frustrating for solo DIYers, though it’s manageable with patience. The table does come together sturdily once you’re past the tricky parts.

**Pros**

* Modern design with a smooth grey veneer that matches most decor styles.
* Spacious hidden compartment and lower shelf for excellent storage options.
* Functional lift-top mechanism that allows for versatile use.
* Solid and heavy build, providing stability when used properly.
* Easy-to-clean surface, ideal for households with frequent spills.

**Cons**

* Hinges for the lift-top could feel sturdier and more reliable over time.
* Assembly can be challenging, especially for one person.
* Corners of the tabletop are prone to chipping during setup or heavy use.
* Load-bearing capacity (44 pounds) limits how much you can store or place on it.
* Scratches easily if not handled with care during cleaning.

When comparing this table to competitors, IKEA’s coffee tables come to mind. While Yaheetech’s option feels sturdier and offers more storage, IKEA tables often have better assembly instructions and a slightly lower price point. Another contender is the Sauder Edge Water Lift-Top Coffee Table, which offers a similar lift-top design but at a higher price. The Sauder model is slightly more robust, but you’d be paying a premium for the brand name and marginally better hinges. The Yaheetech table excels in offering great functionality at a budget-friendly price, making it a strong competitor in its category.

Speaking of pricing, this table sits comfortably in the mid-range market. It’s not the cheapest option out there, but it offers excellent value for the variety of features it includes. The lift-top mechanism, storage compartments, and sleek design make it feel like a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to upgrade their living room without breaking the bank.

Features-wise, the table is packed with thoughtful details. The lift-top mechanism uses gas rods for smooth operation, though it requires some effort during assembly. Foam protective pads are included to prevent any harsh clanging during use, which is a nice touch for those who value quieter furniture. The table’s tapered square legs add a stylish yet sturdy base, ensuring it remains stable during use.

Despite its quirks, the Yaheetech Lift Top Coffee Table is a practical and stylish choice for anyone in need of a multifunctional living room centerpiece. It handles my chaotic lifestyle quite well, from late-night snack sessions to impromptu work-from-home days. If you’re willing to put in the effort during assembly and don’t mind treating it with a little care, this table could easily become a staple in your home.

Or maybe they’re just being nice so I don’t panic and delete the entire thing. Which is, I admit, an actual scenario I considered at 2 AM last night.

That’s why I need you. You’re the real deal. If you have two minutes to spare—maybe while you’re bored at work or procrastinating on something else—please click through my site, let your eyes wander, and tell me everything that pops into your mind. Don’t hold back. I’m bracing myself for tough love because that’s the only way I’ll learn. Shoot me your random thoughts, your deep dives, your “I can’t believe you chose THAT font” laments—whatever. I promise I’ll soak it all in, and I’ll be super grateful for every word.

And hey, if you happen to love it (or at least see some spark of potential), definitely share that too. I could use the hope! Seriously though, I’m standing on the ledge of web design territory, and your advice is going to be the push that either helps me grow wings or faceplant. No pressure, right?

Thank you so, SO much in advance. You have no idea how excited and nervous I am to read your responses. Let’s do this, folks. Give me all you’ve got—my future as a wannabe web designer literally depends on it!

With nervous excitement,

28M here.I am about to share my personal matter which I cannot even share with closest friends.I am preparing for BCS.In shaa Allah I will ace it. I will be attending 45 bcs viva and 46 bcs written exams.But my family is super toxic....24*7 quarrel happens between my two sisters and mother.My retired father acts weird and extremely annoying. He wants his children to remain in nanny state especially me.For this reason my younger sister lose her mind and continuously failed hsc exams but now thankfully continuing studies through open University. My elder sister got divorced in 2022 because my ex brother in law cheated on my sister with his childhood love.Now She's living with us in a 3 room flat... And sharing room with my younger sister.They quarrel every moment for every petty reasons like sharing bed,blocking pathway in the room,not keeping the things at places.My elder sister kept some money in bank account of my father.... When she demands money from him... He just ignores...For that reason she fumes and makes the house in hellfire in regular intervals.My father sneakily enters and checks my sisters out whether they are doing anything wrong or not.... These also brings chaos to the house.My mother understands my struggle and she is empathetic but she tries to escape this by regular visit to my aunt's house.I told my mother see that is the only reason I never had a relationship.... Who in a sane sense give a girl to this family?These made me severely inferior around my friends who are getting married and having children.I just feel very lonely deep inside.I do have romantic side like SRK in the movies but I do carry a mask of misogynistic sigma male persona like as if I never needed woman in my life.Women in my school, college, varsity knew me either shy or arrogant... This is just defense mechanism to avoid female interaction. Let me tell you the intensity of their quarrelsome behaviour.... In the morning like fojor time they abuse each other ku**a,ma**,khan*i etc khati bangali bosti galis.My family was not like this toxic from the beginning but toxicity was there always.Recenly I developed feeling for a girl.... She was not interested in haram relationship so she wanted that the guy who wants her should approach her parents...but recently she posted stories in Instagram that she is taken....so I unfollowed her and she blocked from all the socials when I confronted her.She was really feminine, sweet girl with long shiny hair with gorgeous face. EXACTLY MY TYPE.I really lost her and feeling like a utter loser....I would have asked her out but again family dynamics made me hesitant... She must have though what a timid guy I should move to next...She casually asked me for coffee though...I chickened out and told her in Shaa Allah in the future.Now I have lost apetite for food....I hardly eat... Forcefully concentrate myself to studies...But I question Allah why did He send me in this family?

I used to work as an assistant engineer in a private reputed organization. But when the covid hit I resigned and focused on my gov job preparation like people usually do. I KNOW THIS WAS WORST DECISION of my life....but before covid my family was not that toxic or maybe it was... I just could not find out because of classes and friendly hang outs.I have only two friends living in my proximity now.One friend got a job as officer general at Janata Bank in Sylhet..Another friend's father got cancer so he remains busy in the hospital... Usually we meet around DU area at weekends...whenever I feel too heavy I miss my 2nd friend who is now busy for his father.


I WILL DEFINITELY SUCCEED.but as a man I want some useful suggestion from you.
How do I get rid of this suicidal thoughts?
Will any dream girl come to my life seeing the ugly side of my family?Usually men are judged by the status of their family background in this country...I AM COOKED in that space.I can't stay celibate for life.

Maybe in the April.... Exam of recruitment of Senior officer may held.I will crack it In shaa Allah...My preparation is too good. HOPEFULLY FINANCIALLY I WILL BE COME BACK.

On the top of that my father never agreed to finance my studies abroad...I AM HIS LIFELONG INVESTMENT.... HOW CAN I GET RID OF HIM? 🙂
I hate brown parents....I even can't tell anyone that my shitty father and mother who are emotionally unavailable to me won't finance... So I told my peers I am not interested. 


Anyway rant is finished. Save your fellow brother.....
I want a normal life....normal family.... And a loving wife/fiance/gf.

1imayca,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1imayca/looking_for_some_perspective_and_advice/,Looking for some perspective and advice,"Hey all, a little over two years ago I (37m) started a new job. We are remote but once every other month we do a grouping at corporate HQ in the city. At these I met someone (44f) from a different department about a year and a half ago and we hit it off. After the second meeting we exchanged numbers and always spend these days sitting with each other/get a coffee after when schedules allow. We work in different groups and maybe only once a year are actually involved in a meeting together aside from these in person seating.

Her situation allots less free time than mine (5 years post divorce, 80/20 custody of two children under 10) so we pretty much have just stayed friends over the last year. I am 3 years removed from an engagement ending (I am child free but not anti-kids) and spent those primarily on myself. I have casually had drinks twice since the end of my engagment but for the most part have not been doing any form of dating in that time and am finally in a place where I made some new friends/support group in my town. Me and this woman text every week or so, we listen to similar music and do the same yoga practice so we exchange notes and occasionally sync up a practice even though we are a hundred miles apart. We're both into fitness and vegetarian so recipe exchanges too.

Fast forward to about a month ago my company wants to send a few of the team leaders to a retreat and we both got selected. We live about two hours apart and flew from different cities but planned to stay at the same hotel. The first night we got dinner and afterwards we held hands and kissed for the first time. The next two nights were the same but with escalations (we discussed and no sex, it felt too fast for both of us considering we had finally touched for the first time about 48 hours before). After the 3rd night we were laying in bed and she confided in me that this was the first romantic experience she has had in over 5 years and that I hope I didn't find that off-putting (not at all, was my first one in 3 years).

We skipped the last day of optional meetings and had lunch in a park and held hands up until our flights and just talked about our lives and what got us to this point. It was very nice. I walked her to her cab and we kissed then I told her to let me know when she got home safely. she sent me a picture of us that she took on our trip told me she was back safe later that night. I told her I enjoyed our time and and she hearted the message (I'm old but I'll just take it as a W I think)

Now we are in what I like to call reality and I would like to let her know that I cared about the time we spent together and want to see her again (whether it's weeks or months from now, I am in no rush in my current love life). I just don't want to pressure someone with a busy family life but I also do not want her to think I just used this for physical stuff and have disappeared.

I was considering sending her flowers and the cookies I always used to make my coworkers at Valentine's Day when I went to an office but I spent the last day reading this sub and am afraid of the L word (love bombing) since it took us well over a year to finally spend a night together.

If you made it here thanks for reading but I'd love to hear perspective from others in this situation. After being romantic with someone after a large break did you need time to process it? Should I let her come back to me in time or is it best to let someone know how much the time meant? If it's the reverse and she just played the long game for a quick romantic weekend then I'll be bummed but ultimately happy I was able to give her that because I do care about her. I am all for a slow burn but would like to let her know I'm available to find when she's ready without stepping on her mom routine.",4,1739206885.0,datingoverforty,8,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Here's the situation: I wake up every morning DREADING having to get out of bed. For a long time it was a real hazard for my professional life, especially when Covid started, as it would cause me to be nearly habitually late to my first meeting. When my depression hits it gets even worst.

Now this isn't just mental, it's physical. Lights are to bright, sounds to loud, touches to touchy. Pure sensory overload that feels so constant across stimuli that you mistake it for normal. Even if I get out of bed no trouble I then find that I feel assaulted by even mundane sensory issues that can drive me insane.

I think I just rationalized it as being hyper or drinking my coffee as I seemed to be the only person dealing with it at school or at home. So being a spaz all morning became just sort of my norm, with much of my work getting done at night.

She reached for it, still a little disoriented, expecting to see the usual notifications. But instead, it was a message from Jordan.

Jordan: ""Hey, just wanted to check in and make sure you made it home safe.""

Her heart skipped a beat. She hadn’t expected him to text her so soon after everything that had happened. She hesitated for a moment, then typed back.

Celeste: ""Yeah, I’m good. Thanks for checking.""

She stared at the screen, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. Her thoughts drifted back to the way his lips had felt on hers, the way his hands had held her so close. She couldn’t just let it go. Not now. Not after the tension between them.

Jordan: ""Glad to hear that. I can’t stop thinking about tonight… but I don’t want to rush you or make things weird. Just wanted to know if you'd like to go out with me this weekend.""

She blinked, her pulse racing. Go out? Part of her was terrified. It was one thing to share a kiss and a few heated moments in the heat of the moment, but going out with him—actually spending time with him outside of work—felt different.

Her fingers hovered over the screen again, uncertainty creeping in. She hadn’t been with anyone in so long. The thought of dating, of letting someone close again, felt overwhelming. But, damn, the pull of him was too strong to ignore.

Celeste: ""I don’t know, Jordan. I’m not sure if it’s a good idea. I mean, we work together, and I don’t want to complicate things.""

She stared at the message for a long moment, biting her lip. The words felt like an excuse, but it was easier than facing the truth of how much she wanted to say yes.

A few minutes passed before her phone buzzed again.

Jordan: ""I get it. I’m not trying to complicate anything. But we’ve been talking for a while now, and I feel like we’ve got something. No pressure, just… want to spend some time with you. Maybe just dinner or coffee, something low-key?""

Celeste’s heart fluttered. She wanted to say yes so badly. But there was a part of her that wanted to keep her walls up, to guard her heart from anything that could hurt her—or them.

She sat up, the bed feeling too big now, the loneliness settling in again. She needed this. She needed someone who made her feel alive again. But could she trust herself to let go?

After a long pause, she typed back.

Celeste: ""Okay. Maybe dinner. But I’m not making any promises beyond that.""

She hit send before she could second-guess herself. It was done.

Almost immediately, her phone lit up again.

Jordan: ""I’m looking forward to it. And don’t worry, no promises from me either. Just a good time. How about Saturday?""

Celeste smiled despite herself. There was something in his words that made her feel like maybe, just maybe, this could be something different.

Celeste: ""Saturday sounds good.""

Jordan: ""Perfect. I’ll pick you up around 7. Can’t wait to see you.""

She couldn’t help the fluttering in her chest. The excitement mixed with nerves, like she was stepping into unknown territory.

Celeste: ""Okay. See you then.""

She set the phone down and leaned back against the pillow, her mind swirling. Saturday. Dinner with Jordan. What would it be like? Could she really let herself go?

One thing was certain: she couldn’t wait to find out.

What is the alternative?,"The state of thinking I should do something and trying to get myself to do it is one of the main sources of suffering in my life. At first, this just seems like vague psychological pain. But there seem to be painful emotional meanings behind it, like:

  * I'm responsible for doing this, and if I don't do it I'm being bad

  * Bad things may happen if I don't do this, and if they do they're my fault and I'm guilty of that

  * Shame about not doing things

  * Anger about not doing things, both about what hurt me so bad to make me stuck, and about myself not doing things

  * Fear about direct consequences that may happen if I don't do things

  * Fear about how others might judge me and even harm me if I don't do things

There may be a trap here, because this makes me feel worse and decreases most motivation. So, I keep trying to do things in this way, but end up farther away from the state I need to be in to actually do things.

When something seems important enough and urgent enough, that can lead to motivation. I can't say I like this kind of motivation very much. It limits what I can do, and it seems unpleasant, though once I start doing things that can be surprisingly okay or even enjoyable. This kind of motivation seems based on a relatively stable evaluation of situations, and I'm practically never able to engage this kind of motivation by making myself feel bad about how I'm not doing things.

I don't really know what is the alternative for trying to get myself to do things.

The main other thing I've tried is to get myself into a better state, where I have more motivation. I've tried to do that via pleasant experiences and via various drugs. Even drinking coffee was a bit of an attempt to do this. But this only ever helped with small and relatively insignificant things, where avoidance wasn't strong. When I was seriously stuck trying to get myself to do something, it never helped.

Edit: After posting this the obvious problem here is that I don't look at the thoughts and feelings telling me to not do things. They're usually even more vague than those related to the idea that I should do things. Probably those need to be addressed in some way, and not just somehow overpowered.",8,1739206340.0,CPTSDFreeze,2,1.0,False

Yes, that one week you don’t get no sleep, watch hours of TV you don’t get a word of, fall in-love with a song that has no chances of winning yet somehow you end up sad it’s all over!

So, what do we have this time around?



**NIGHT #1**

All 29 (following Emis Killa's withdrawl) artists will be performing their songs. The press will be voting, and by the end of the night (whenever this will be), their top 5 will be revealed in random order.  



**NIGHT #2 / NIGHT #3**

15 (Wednesday) then 14 (Thursday) out of the 29 artists will be performing their songs. The radio jury (50%) and the televote (50%) will be voting, and by the end of each night, the night’s top 5 will be revealed in random order.



**NIGHT #4**

Covers night! Each artist performers a cover of an Italian/foreign song with another artist, who can also be one of the other participating artists! Link for the full list.  [For the full list](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1iadykb/list_of_covers_for_sanremo_2025s_fourth_night/). 

The press (33%), radio jury (33%) and the televote (34%) will all be voting, and one winner will be crowned by the end of the night. This year, the results of the covers night won’t be a part of the artists’ overall results - it is a separate competition. 

Bonus: Mahmood will be co-hosting the night!



**NIGHT #5**

Aka the night you realize you actually like all 29 songs, in one way or another. The 29 artists will perform their songs again. This night, the press (33%), radio jury (33%) and the televote (34%). 

After 29 songs and probably 57 interval acts, the 29th-6th place will be revealed. Five finalists will move forward. 

Unlike other years, the results of Nights 1-3 & 5 don’t get erased at this point. They are a part of the final score. There will be another vote too,  by the same 33%-33%-34% method. After some other interval acts and a few awards that will make you wonder why some artists are coming back on stage and if they won, the winner will be revealed!

**OTHER THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW…**

* As you can understand, Sanremo is looooong. If you don’t have a coffee machine, you should seriously consider buying one. 
* Do not try to understand how the voting system works. It can cause serious headaches. [If you dare to try though, one of our kind users made a detailed thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1ilc1zc/pressjury_vote_at_sanremo_superfinal_changed_now/)
* There will be a news broadcast jumpscare around 00:00 CET every night. Brace yourselves.
* The audience might boo at some results. Think of them as eurofans when their favorite doesn’t win a national final. 
* Artists might do weird or crazy things on stage. It usually has something to do with Fantasanremo. 
* Sanremo is the best thing ever created! Have fun!",64,1739205986.0,eurovision,33,0.99,False
1imakj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JadedPromotion9451/comments/1imakj6/how_to_stop_panic_attack_forever/,How to stop Panic attack forever,"As anxiety worsens, it can lead to panic disorder. Panic attacks often come out of nowhere, even in everyday situations, bringing a sudden wave of intense fear and a sense of impending doom, causing extreme distress.

# Common Symptoms of a Panic Attack:

 • Rapid heartbeat

• Chest pain or tightness

 • Shortness of breath

 • Feeling like you can’t breathe

 • Nausea or stomach pain

 • Shaking or trembling

 • Numbness or tingling in hands and feet

 • Dizziness or headache

 • Hot flashes or chills

# What causes panic attacks?

The exact cause of panic disorder is still unclear, according to current research. However, it is believed that the underlying physiology of panic disorder is similar to that of most anxiety disorders. The intense feelings of fear and near-death sensations in panic attacks are linked to dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system, which is also associated with anxiety disorders. When the sympathetic nervous system becomes overactive while the parasympathetic nervous system, which normally counterbalances it, is suppressed, severe physical symptoms like heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and numbness can occur. However, medical tests typically show no organic damage, meaning conditions like heart disease or stroke are not the cause.

From a biological perspective, scientists have identified several possible factors that may contribute to panic disorder:

 • **Serotonin imbalance:** Either too little or too much serotonin in the brain can disrupt autonomic nervous system function.

 **• Amygdala hypersensitivity:** The amygdala, a brain region responsible for processing emotions, may be overly sensitive to fear-related stimuli, leading to dysregulated physical reactions.

 **• HPA axis overactivation:** Increased activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can lead to excessive stress responses, contributing to panic attacks.

# How do you calm down from an anxiety attack?

Although many people believe they can control a panic attack with breathing techniques, positive thinking, or cold water, these methods are often ineffective for someone experiencing a true panic attack. When the nervous system is severely overstimulated and out of balance, the fastest and most effective solution is to take a sedative immediately.

# The Importance of Sedatives for Panic Attacks

Panic disorder is typically treated with benzodiazepines as sedatives. These medications work quickly, often relieving symptoms within 30 minutes to an hour, making them highly effective during panic attacks.

During a panic attack, prolonged episodes can lead to complications such as atrial fibrillation and excessive nervous system strain, which may cause physical harm over time. Sedatives help stabilize the nervous system and prevent excessive damage.

However, benzodiazepines can be addictive, so they should only be used for short-term relief. Many people avoid them due to concerns about dependence, but these risks can be managed. By tapering off the medication after about a week and using it only for acute attacks, addiction can be avoided. At the same time, high-dose therapeutic supplements support nervous system repair, while a targeted diet and exercise plan help restore and enhance brain function. This approach not only prevents dependence but also leads to a long-term resolution of panic disorder.

# Panic attack treatment plan

People with panic disorder are highly sensitive to certain substances and should avoid alcohol, coffee, tea, chocolate, and anything containing nicotine.

 1. If you experience a panic attack for the first time, see a doctor for a full medical evaluation to rule out other potential conditions. If any underlying health issues are found, seek treatment as soon as possible.

 2. If panic attacks become frequent, consult your primary care doctor and consider taking benzodiazepine tranquilizers to stabilize your nervous system. Try to limit their use to no more than one month.

 3. At the same time, it’s essential to address the root cause of panic attacks: brain and nervous system dysfunction. This can be treated with pharmaceutical-grade supplements.

 • Nervous system repair: Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, Methyl folate (5-MTHF), Vitamin B12, Vitamin B complex, Magnesium Glycinate or Magnesium L-Threonate

 • Brain function repair: Pharmaceutical grade fish oil, Choline, Vitamin C

I just don't drink coffee anymore. I guess people see the coffee as worth it since it's hard to make a good perfect cup. I switched over to tea because it's a cleaner drink and I just kept making bad cups of coffee. I always make a good cup of tea. 

 I feel a little lucid when I drink coffee. But sometimes I miss it and think of drinking it again lol

I started yesterday, and chose the morning specifically so I could have an empty stomach, the whole day ahead to deal with any discomfort, and also wanted to make sure I had my morning coffee/constitutional ;) 

I did feel a short bout of queasiness but it was brief and not too intense, and within minutes of the injection. I did have dry mouth for a while afterward, but I drink a ton of water anyhow so I figured that isn’t a bad thing since water helps with stool consistency. 

Was able to eat a later lunch without issue. Dinner is where I was super surprised - I had a small bowl of an Asian style slaw I made and a bowl of salmon salad which I had an extremely hard time finishing. This was less than 12 hours from the injection, so it kicks in pretty quickly. I did finish (wanted to get my protein in) and managed to eat a few blackberries for extra fiber. 

I’m recovering from the flu and felt pretty tired shortly after my dinner, which was around 7:30pm.  Went to bed early, but ended up having a hard time sleeping all of last night. I have read some people felt restless so I plan to read more about that. I could have taken melatonin but it was too late by the time I was frustrated by the poor sleep. 

Day 2, luckily had bowel movements! This is what I’m most afraid is of constipation. I’m very regular so I’m invested in staying very hydrated and focusing primarily on fiber and protein in my meals. 

I’m a big time foodie and today I can’t be bothered to think about food at all. I do intermittent fasting so I plan to research more how others on glp1 meds have managed fasting with this. I used to do longer fasts but the last couple of years have been hard (other medical issues) so the most I’ve prior to this was OMAD, maybe a full 24. I feel like this may be a great way to be more planned with my fasts now that the food noise is gone. 

I’m just thrilled to have minimal nausea or acid reflux. No stomach pain after eating, either.

1imaan9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1imaan9/boyfriend35m_said_something_inappropriate_to/,boyfriend(35m) said something inappropriate to my(35f) friend(30f) and i don't know how to feel,"**Background:** I met my boyfriend over 4 years ago. He had just gotten out of a relationship, I was recently divorced, and we started a fwb thing, turned situationship where we were essentially together (always at my house, sleeping together, going out, talking every day all day, he would do big and little things for me that I'd only expect a boyfriend or husband to do). It was a huge sore spot for me that he wouldn't officially commit. We had fights every couple months about it where he would always inevitably say ""If i'm not enough for you, go find someone who is. Find someone who will do the whole relationship thing and I'll be here as your friend."" He would do minor things that were disrespectful to me, like complimenting other women online, still looking at and liking his ex's photos on social media for almost two years after he and I started sleeping together.

But eventually after 3 years, I'd had enough of waiting and the drama and I started to distance myself from him. I started a new job, started to hang out with a guy I met there. During this time, my now boyfriend was still trying to be around me, turning around and going ""i want to commit to you"" etc. I didn't believe him but I also didn't tell him that or tell him my plans to distance myself. I just did it. I asked for more alone time, etc, had him come over less. I assumed if I moved on from him romantically he would still be my friend like he always said.

Well, I hung around with the work guy more, eventually slept with him a couple times and didn't tell now boyfriend. One night, drunk, work guy came over and another male friend of ours came over. A threesome was proposed and me, feeling free from this trapped 3 years, wanting to experience something new, agreed to it. I don't regret it.

Now boyfriend knew I had been hanging around work guy and was jealous. But I kept informing him, ""you never wanted to be with me, I'm single and dating."" I never told him I slept with anyone else though because he started to change his tune and say ""give me a couple months before you go out and date. I can't be your friend if you sleep with someone else."" Which hurt me because I assumed he would be there as a friend at least like he always said. Eventually though, I started to not see now boyfriend at all, to let our friendship die down. My plan was to just remove him from my life entirely but i was extremely sad. He would call me often too. His grandmother had died, and he would tell me about that. He would beg to be given a chance to actually commit to me. At one point he was so sad and contrite he cried which I had never seen him do. The way he spoke to me was unlike anyway he had spoken to me before. Eventually I told him we could ""try"" but I had to tell him something so we could start a real relationship on honest footing. I kind of wish I hadn't told him now, but I told him about the guy at work and the threesome. Now boyfriend was shocked and hurt, but I was angry at his hurt because he maintained for years that he didn't want to commit, so I had been single and was doing things single people do. I didn't do it to hurt him. I did it to break out of this trap I was in. He cried again from this too, which again, was super unlike him, but we started to work out an actual relationship, timidly because both of us were hurt. I was hurt from the years of disconnect and minor disrespect his showed me over and over, and he was hurt because I kept the work guy a secret while he was trying to commit to me.

Well, it took about 6-8 months for me to start to let go of the hurt and feel comfortable with now boyfriend. In the time he has been my official partner, he's been the most helpful, loving person. He did a lot of things to assuage any insecurities without me even asking, like deleting scantily-clad women from his social media, posting me freely online, holding hands with me in public, telling me he loved me. All the things he wouldn't do before. We often had talks too about the first three years, and he admitted how selfish he had been, which surprised me and was a big relief to hear him just say that. He said he'd been selfish and hadn't wanted me to go anywhere while he sorted himself out.

**Actual issue:** Now fast forward to us being officially together for a little over a year. Everything has been wonderful and I regained my trust in him, felt his commitment, saw all the things he did for me on a daily basis. And we actually talk about the future together, planning things, etc.

I met this girl, who was a friend of some of his friends, and she and I hit it off. I don't have many close friends and the only women I talk to on a regular basis are my sisters, so I was super stoked. First issue was that the first night we hung out it seemed like she didn't know when to quit drinking so I forced us both to stop at one point, and another issue was during our first conversation she stated, ""I have a bad track record with keeping friends."" I remember that so clearly because I knew it was a red flag but I figured I would cross that bridge when I got to it.

She and I started to text semi frequently, my boyfriend and I went to her art show, and we invited her out to our club nights. We invited her to see a movie with us and some other friends. She was single so my boyfriend would try to stay back and let the two of us talk and hang out since she was essentially the third wheel. Well, she would always try to pull him into the conversation, was often touching his arm and shoulder, and sometimes I'd feel left out because she would be asking him so many questions and ignoring me. I complained to my boyfriend that if that happens he needs to try to bring ME into the conversation next time and he agreed but I remember him seeming annoyed because it wasn't HIS fault. It was hers. But I didn't want to run off my new friend.

She started to come over to my house more often and I would go to hers. When she came to my house, my boyfriend would be there and he would stay out of the way or be in another room. She'd always ask him for a hug when she arrived (and hug me too) and because she's kind of a hippie I just figured it was her being nice. We had more club nights with other friends, and she'd be grabbing my boyfriend. She was right at the line of being inappropriate so I didn't feel like I needed to say anything yet. I also would see my boyfriend (always sober) during these moments and he would push her off or look annoyed. He'd move away from her or move closer to me. I never had any inkling he was into her in any way. He would sometimes complain if I wanted to bring her with us places but he was also very patient because he knew I wanted more female friends. But he also would tell me she seemed like she drank too much and smoked too much and he would complain about how touchy she was. I always made excuses. I was uncomfortable with her actions but I thought I was being too sensitive and because she's a barber I insisted she cut my boyfriend's hair. Idk why but I think I just wanted us all to be friends, and every thing would be good.

Well, one night we went out with a group of friends, she and I drank a little before going to the club but whereas I drank one mixed drink, she had apparently drank almost half a bottle of vodka and didn't tell me till we were at the club. She had more drinks there, hung around with my boyfriend's friend all night (who is taken and she knew that) and then was hanging on my boyfriend by the end of the night, asking about his friend, telling my bf she was so glad we were all friends, saying she was so grateful we were taking care of her. I was drunk but not anywhere near where she was, and my boyfriend was sober. To me this was just drunk behavior and it was embarrassing but I didn't think much of it. We all went home and she stayed over on the couch, which I think she had been planning on doing the entire time as she had brought a ton of clothes and obviously the heavy drinking before we even went out, which annoyed me because why not just ask me? I would have been fine with it, but then at that point it was a safety thing and of course she had to stay.

My boyfriend and I went to our bedroom where he told me she had asked for a hug before bed (i don't recall her asking me for a hug but she might have before she laid down) and he said he gave her a quick little pat on the shoulders and she said ""that wasn't long enough"" but he said ""yes it was"" and left the room.

The next morning, I was the last awake. I felt a little left out that the two of them had been up in the living room for an hour without me but whatever. When she left to go home I asked about how the morning had went, he said fine and the two of them had had a cigarette together, made coffee, just hung out.

Well, the next day my boyfriend said he needed to talk to me. He told me he had had a conversation with my friend outside the previous morning that went sideways. They had started talking about my boyfriend's friend, and she seemed embarrassed since the friend had a girlfriend and she had been following him around the club. My boyfriend tried to tell her about the friend, etc, and why it would be a bad idea to get in a relationship right after another one and brought up his and my relationship and how we started out and how it was kind of rough. He claims she said ""oh yeah she told me about the guy she slept with at her work."" He got immediately angry because he didn't think I would tell her such a personal story considering the girl was also supposed to be kind of my boyfriend's friend as well. But he said he hadn't told anyone but me his feelings about the whole thing and since I had always been hurt by his non-commitment, I felt like he didn't have a right to be upset. Our conversations on it never went anywhere and he never felt like he had a right to feel bad at all. So he told her the whole story from his perspective. He felt like he finally had a space to vent and since she was my friend too, there would be no ill feelings from her on it. Well, he told her about the threesome I'd had and said sarcastically (he said) ""if I'd gotten drunk I might have fucked both of y'all."" He said it out of anger at me he said, not because he would have, or wanted to.

Obviously this hurt me to hear, for multiple reasons but it's not like I've never said something hurtful before. I told him I forgave him but it would take time for me to forget and I didn't want him hanging out with us when she was with me. I also wanted to get her side of the conversation especially if she took it the wrong way and was feeling badly. Her version was slightly different where she said he complained about me a LOT and he had said he gets wild when drunk and ""if i had gotten wasted i would have fucked both of yall."" I also found out that she had messaged him a few hours after the conversation about how inappropriate it all was and he apologized and asked if they could forget the conversation ever happened. He didn't dispute her version or try to explain himself. The thing is, her version (which was told to me after she'd been drinking again) was very disjointed and relied a lot on how she felt in the moment, when she had just woken up and was severely hungover. I don't know if I should even believe her account when after 3 months of hanging out she couldn't even get my son's name right. (Her son and my son would play games together and her son would talk about my son too).

I talked with my boyfriend about her account of the conversation and he swears up and down it wasn't like that. He rarely drinks and only ever gets drunk around me at home, and that's maybe once every two months. When we're out he'll have one beer if that. I've known him for over 4 years. I've heard accounts from his lifelong friends about ""that ONE time you finally got drunk"" or ""that ONE time you took an edible."" So no, it doesn't make sense for him to talk about drinking when he rarely does. However, she seems to get wild when she drinks. So I wonder if some of what she said was projection since she was feeling bad about hanging around our other taken friend all night.

Another wrench in the mix is that she told me he had messaged her a couple times which she found weird. I didn't know about this and he had deleted the messages but she showed me. All of the messages however were him telling her that we (him and i) would go to her art show, or ""tell US when you make it home safe."" Extremely innocent texts, and after she had cut his hair he sent her a picture with it styled because according to him she had been talking about how nice it would look, and he didn't have her style it at the time. To him, too, I had pushed him to go get his haircut from her. And he's right, I did. And I know he left without it being styled. I don't think any of these texts prove he was trying to get with her. On top of that, he didn't text her anymore for two months.

Anyway, she and I had more conversations about it and I told her basically by the way, you were almost over the line where I'd have to say something about your behavior around my boyfriend. And I told her I never ever suspected my boyfriend was into her in anyway so I don't think he was coming on to her. After this conversation we didn't talk about her touching on him anymore. Then a day later she sends me a long message claiming he had always made her feel uncomfortable. She claimed the texts he sent were weird, meanwhile she didn't say a thing to me about them. I'm also not sure she would have said anything about the conversation they'd had if he hadn't told me. She started to say everyone was blaming her and putting all this on her like it was her fault, and bringing up the touching and familiarity saying she didn't think she was and if she was, she didn't mean it. She then brought up our friends, who had been friends with my boyfriend for a long time. I had heard these friends say unprompted on multiple occasions how great my boyfriend is and gush about him being so helpful and kind. Well, she said these friends listened to her issues and said they too have always had an issue with my boyfriend.

It was at this point I was severely annoyed. I don't really know what to do. My boyfriend has always been very friendly with literally everyone and he's always networking (he's a musician) and he said he always has so many conversations with people he'll go and delete them regularly if they haven't talked for a while and the texts were so innocent I don't even know why he would care if I saw. So I told her, ""unless there's more, I'm not going to end things over this."" Like to me the main issue is him getting angry at me and saying something hurtful to my friend. But then she's turning around and making it this huge thing like he's always been inappropriate towards her and it's invalidating her account of the conversation. I just don't know what to do. I'm angry at my boyfriend for doing this at all but if he was just complaining to a friend? I don't think that's grounds to break up.

**\*\*I included the texts they exchanged about the conversation they had the afternoon after it happened. For what it's worth, when he told me he seemed extremely apologetic and was willing to talk with me for hours about it. He wasn't dismissive or defensive at all about it. He did however make it seem like they had had this text conversation outside only a few minutes after the initial one. I even asked him straight up, ""So you had the conversation and a few minutes later she just switched up and said it was inappropriate?"" And he said yes and that he apologized on the porch then and there. Also according him, he told her once I would hate that he was talking about it and to not tell her, and she agreed and said she wouldn't. She was also engaged in the conversation and talking about her own past boyfriends whereas according to her he just talked straight the entire time, venting.**

This isn’t my first time overthinking swallowing/being afraid of choking, I first dealt with it years ago and it comes and goes but I’ve always gotten myself through it.

A few days ago suddenly this fear came back into my life when I was drinking my morning coffee and suddenly I forgot how to swallow and I ended up choking on it and coughing for minutes.

Usually starting my day with a coffee and having a sugar free energy drink or sparkling flavoured water for my break as a boost. I'd often use an electrolyte tablet that I have for cycling. Usually I'd get home pretty tired and would just watch some YouTube/streaming before bed so it wasn't too difficult to fast.

Now I'm in a warehouse job, I went from admin where I'd walk legitimately 1,500-2,500 steps a day to 9-11k steps each day (in my defence I'm 6'4 so I do take a few less steps lol). It's not super labour intensive but always moving around doing something. I come home fairly exhausted, I thought it was an adjustment but even after just over 2 months it hasn't really gotten much easier. I come home wanting big carbs lol.

I had a baby late 2023 so 2024 literally every day off was spent at home on baby duty and my weight has really crept up. I had a stomach bug recently where I was vomiting 9pm-3am every 30 minutes like clockwork, followed by immediately sitting on the bowl. I lost 6lbs in two days. Obviously dehydrated but a lot less bloated for once which was nice.

I'd like to lose the bloat and shave a few pounds. Does anyone have any tips for fasting when on your feet all day?

I'm 19 and I've worked before, first as a helper in a warehouse for a store, and second as a barista. I hated every single moment I spent doing both jobs. 

For the first one, my role was to help stocking items, doing the heavy lifting and things of that nature, but I would also have to work in the store, acting as a security officer WHILE handling customer requests/inquiries. I shit you not, that store was packed every day, so both my brain and muscles were tested to their limits. I would come home, take a shower and crash without having dinner. 

Few months after, my smart ass thought, maybe I should change environment, work in catering or something close to that. Bam, I find this coffee shop that was recruiting and training newbies to become fully fledged baristas. Sounded nice so I gave it a shot and quickly found myself working there. Making coffee was great, it was fun. Something that isn't often associated to WORK. Well, it was fun until they sent me to a different branch in one of the busiest shopping centres in my country. You think I'm a sissy because I'm complaining about that? Oh you're not gonna believe me. That branch was the first one to exist, and they haven't done any renovation whatsoever. The working area was cramped, there were ovens a few inches to my back, the air conditioning was not functional, and the team consisted of 10 people. I had to work more hours, in a cramped space, playing twister to move from one place to another, while my back was getting toasted. And CHRIST the waves of rude customers did not stop at any point in the day. 

  
Fortunately, I had to continue my studies for a while, but now that I'm done and I'm currently waiting for responses to my university applications, I need to work. My family isn't so financially stable that I can sit and do nothing for a few months. So, I have applied to almost 50 places with the ones who responded being relatively fast, which I am grateful for, but almost all of them reminded me of those two places so I could not stay for more than a day. I genuinely got so anxious that it was impossible to go on. In my head it went like ""no way I have to go through all of that again"", on repeat. My only hope, another coffee place which a lot of people claimed paid well, and provided some advantages, eventually called me for an interview at one of their tables. Probably the most pathetic moment of my life. The interviewers (there were two of them) said they would be glad to have me in the company, but added that I would have the minimum wage, which is like peanuts in my country, and that I would have to work the same hours as my old coffee place. Now, what really destroyed my hopes was what one of the interviewers said, it basically went: ""Take a look around, this is what slow business is to us."" When I tell you, the place was packed, I MEAN IT. There were barely any free seats, and this guy was talking about slow business. My jaw physically dropped, and I looked at the guy straight in the eyes and said, ""I don't think I can do that."" They replied, ""We know."" Seriously, what the fuck was that supposed to mean? There's no way they can say that right? Anyway, I still haven't been able to hold a job. I get so anxious it's unbelievable. I tried to apply for administrative positions, but they almost always ask for experience.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1im9ylc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parosmia/comments/1im9ylc/finally_im_back_after_2_years_oct_2022_jan_2025/,"FINALLY, I'M BACK! After 2+ years (Oct 2022 – Jan 2025) + My Fav Alt Food Hacks","It's finally my turn to write this post. I've been lurking here the whole time and have learned a lot, tried A LOT (supplements mainly), and always loved reading the success stories to give myself hope. I can finally say I'm 100% cured and I'm SO grateful. 

**My experience in a nutshell:** I was 3wks postpartum with my second baby, got some form of the 'vid, completely lost taste & smell for a week, then when it came back, everything was fucked up. Eggs were horrendous, chicken was bad, sour cream disgusting, RANCH – forget about it, the universally loved aroma of onions & garlic sauteéing in butter...weird, yogurt terrible, my beloved cream cheese – garbage. *I was devastated.* I LOVE to cook and eat. 

I knew this condition could last a long time as my cousin was dealing with it long before me, and I'd read your stories here on this sub. I thought it'd clear up faster than this, but started to get a little more patient as I learned this is related/caused by nerve damage, which just TAKES TIME to heal. I took some things to try to help, Dr. Berg's Nerve Support, ALA, Lion's Mane, all the things...but ultimately, I think it was just TIME, unfortunately. One recent change in my life that may deserve some credit toward healing: I've been weightlifting and try to do sprints 1x a week. I've heard that exercise can help certain symptoms of long covid and/or parosmia, so this is potentially what healed the last lingering bit of damage for me. 

**Recovery Timeline:** in the beginning I had far quicker improvement, getting 1 or 2 foods back often. I was adamant about not excluding these foods from my life and trying things often. Chicken, onions, and garlic probably came back the quickest for me. Other things took over 2 years and were very stubborn. I consistently exposed myself to the bad foods though, always always always smelling the coffee grounds, dipping my finger in the sour cream, smelling the kids' yogurt...Trying to remember, trying to retrain. As a woman, I noticed temporary improvement for some foods around ovulation, which is interesting since smell is usually *heightened* during that time. I know a lot of ladies on this sub have made this connection as well, everyone with different 'good' times during their cycle. 

**My final recovery came OVERNIGHT** – just like that, my final offenders are no longer offending. I just recovered form a sinus infection, but I've had a few of those since the parosmia began...(I always hoped getting sick then better would flip some sort of switch but it never did).

**Core Longterm Offenders:** The slowest part was probably the past year, where my core offenders were just not budging: **sour** **cream**, **yogurt**, **buttermilk and ranch,** **cilantro** smelled soapy but I've always kept eating it because it tasted ok, **EGGS**, **white bread/crackers** smelled off and didn't taste great, **coffee** grounds smelled terrible, **some perfumes** still chemical-ly smelling, **coca cola** tasted like perfume, **french fries** smelled a bit off and didn't taste totally normal, **corn chips** smelled & tasted off, some **cheese** had that cultured dairy smell but I could mostly eat it...

**Here are my favorite food swaps to get you through it** – because you WILL get through it!!!

|Bad/Weird/Off Food|Alt Food / Modification|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Chicken|Use lots of hot sauce. Franks, Yellow Bird habanero, Cholula|I recovered from chicken quickly thank goodness|
|Eggs|cook ground chorizo or ground breakfast sausage, then add your whisked eggs (splash of milk helps w/ the egg flavor too), + fresh grated Tillamook cheddar. Wrap in a flour tortilla or eat as is.|hot sauce helps plain eggs too. scrambled are far more palatable than fried. Use soft scramble method & do nottt overcook. That makes the offensive flavor/smell so much worse.|
|Sour Cream|Mexican Crema / table cream|might have to experiment with brands, but this isn't cultured and sour like sour cream|
|Sour Cream 2|Instead of sour cream on tacos or burrito bowls w/ rice (my favorite), make a mayo based sauce |In a Blender: 1 tbsp olive oil 1 lime, juiced 1.5 tbsp mayo, 2-3 cloves of garlic, peeled 1/4 cup cilantro, leaves and stems 1 jalapeño, stemmed, and roughly chopped (remove the *ribs and seeds if you don't want it too spicy – I leave 'em in ;*), 1 Tbsp honey, if needed a little water to thin. |
|Ranch|BLENDED cottage cheese with splash of milk to thin + Hidden Valley ranch packet. |Bonus: high protein! |
|Ranch 2|Caesar Dressing never bothered me! (Cardini's brand)|One of my fav easy lunches is romaine or iceberg lettuce tossed in Caesar w/ lots of freshly cracked pepper, shredded chicken tossed in Frank's Red Hot, wrapped in a wrap or flour tortilla. Sometimes chicken nuggets tossed in Red Hot. The Costco chicken breast nuggets/chunks are great and good protein to calorie ratio.|
|Yogurt|BLENDED cottage cheese with splash of milk to thin + drizzle of honey and/or your favorite jam, granola ||
|Cheese|For me, the pre-shredded stuff was worst. A straight up cheese would rarely bother me. Tillamook cheddar block, freshly grated at home, delicious. ||
|White Bread|REAL sourdough. I love the one Whole Foods makes. The more processed the bread, the worst it was. Most grocery store sourdough isn't real fermented.||
|Coca-Cola|Dr. Pepper ||
|Coffee|Espresso shots over ice & cold milk. Iced coffee didn't bother me at all, whereas brewed hot coffee had all the bad coffee smells that coffee grounds did. The coffee aisle at the grocery store, agh. Would always make me sad.||
|Tortilla Chips / Tortillas|White corn tastes far better than yellow for me.||

1im9xct,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyalNavy/comments/1im9xct/possible_medical_drawback/,Possible Medical Drawback,"Disclaimer: I apologise for the long post. I really would like some hope as to how i can clean this mess made by the NHS service.

I had applied to recieve my medical records so i can for see any potential appeals that i may need to carry out. 

I had recieved these documents today and theres a few issues that i had noticed on there.

1) it states in 2018 that i had depression apparently and this couldnt have been further from the truth. My dad passed away in 2017 and being the eldest son i didnt really shed a tear or mourn so to speak so my sisters (who work in the NHS) told me to go with them one day to a coffee sit in place. So as i turned up with her there was a medical person there and i just walked out after explaining to them that i  didnt require any of the support  that they were offering. I just needed space as i was very close to my dad and its going to take me time to heal so i returned back to uni to keep me occupied.

In 2022 i had my flat broken into my masked robbers. I have been targetted for the last 5 years by a gang as i had refused to open a business and wash money for an underworld firm(dads side of the family) which led to me leaving Birmingham around 2020. I moved to Northampton but little did i know i was going to be targetted again. 

In 2021 they had broken into my car 3 x within the space of a 8 days which led to me losing a permanent job at Rolls Royce. This was shortly followed by the gang breaking into my flat in 2022 whilst i was working as a fabricator in a metal workshop.

So the result of the incidences taking place in 2021 had me feeling a certain way as i didnt know as a working person what i could do as this firm (they got friends working in the police force)  had cost me a permanent job for no fault of my own. I was feeling down to a certain degree. Definitely wasnt depressed or had anxiety. However in an attempt to save my job at Rolls Royce i had asked my GP for a sicknote and he decided to put on their that i had depression. This wasnt true but i didnt really contest this as the only thought for me was to try save my job as i was living by myself and had no support network around me.

Following the incident in Jan 2022 with my flat burgled i couldnt go to work and leave my flat without a front door -i live by myself. I had a telephone consultation with a GP to arrange a sicknote to buy myself time for the council to fix my door whilst trying to save my job. I literally had nothing but a single loaf of bread in my flat at the time.  He asked me if i had been diagnosed with anxiety before to which i answered no and he decided to do a MH questionnaire. And then went to say hes going to prescribe some medication.

I never picked up or consumed any medication.

The doc who wrote this out decided to right that i was suffering all this due to losing my dad at 17. Which isnt true as my dad was alive and healthy at this time. 

He also mentions me taking class As whilst drinking. 

Now the question he asked was had i taken drugs in the past to which i answered when i was Uni (2018/19). This was before i moved out of Birmingham.

Now that i have recieved my medical history for the first time all this has come to light. I have a copy of the questionnaire the doctor filled out while i had my telephone consultation and the question which he asked specifically was

Are you feeling down , depressed or hopeless. To which i answered yes as i was feeling down. Not depressed or hopeless.

Ive had acid reflux/gastritis over a period of a couple years in the past. I was referred for a endoscopy which didnt take place due to NHS backlogs however somehow theyve mentioned IBS on my medical record without any diagnosis.

When i had questioned the receptionist who handed these over she told me if it wasnt true the doctor wouldnt have wrote it.

This has totally thrown a curve ball for me. I have plans to serve my full 22 years in the Boat service and really need some help as i feel like half of whats on my record isnt entirely true. I feel as though my life depends on this as im in a bad situation where im living and dont want to be a product of my enviroment. Most of the people my age in my area are either in prison or dead and i really dont want a life like that.

Btw ive never taken any anti depressants or mood pills. The only medication that ive taken was Omeprazole and Lanzeprazole. However i was given Vitamin D3 by the same doc who did the telephone consultation (he agreed that i might be feeling down due to the lack of sunlight-result of shorter days in Jan) this is the first time ive taken a vitamin which cured the acid reflux/gastro issues i had suffered in the past. Ive not had any gastro issues since and i am a fit and healthy 32 M.

If i could take things private i would but have no idea how this all works. Im currently Unemployed and trying my best to change things around me.

TIA for making it here and would really like some input please.

Flight attendant Jackie Wheeler noticed a plane full of strangers sitting in awkward silence during a maintenance delay. Instead of letting tension build, she grabbed the intercom and announced: ""Since we're stuck here for a while, turn to the person next to you and tell them your most embarrassing moment.""

The cabin erupted in laughter and conversation. By the time the plane took off 40 minutes later, former strangers were exchanging contact information and making plans to meet up. One simple prompt had transformed a plane full of uncomfortable strangers into a community of friends.

Think about that for a moment. What really happened here? A group of people who were afraid to talk to each other suddenly became friends. All because one person gave them permission to be human.

**The Simple Truth About Conversations**

Imagine you're playing a game of catch with someone. To start the game, one person needs to throw the ball first.  Conversations are just like that game of catch. Someone needs to throw the ball first.  You throw something simple, they throw something back. That's it. No complex formulas needed.

**Why Starting Feels Hard (But Actually Isn't)**

Let's break this down to its simplest parts. When you're hesitating to start a conversation, what's really happening in your brain?

·      **""What if they reject me?""** Think about it: When was the last time you got angry at someone for saying hello? Most likely never. Just like you wouldn't get mad at someone for offering you a cookie.

·      **""I don't know what to say!""** Remember being a kid and making friends at the playground? You didn't need clever lines then. You just pointed at something cool and said ""Look at that!"" It still works today.

·      **""I need the perfect opener!""** Jackie Wheeler didn't use a perfect opener. She just mentioned something everyone could relate to - embarrassing moments. Simple beats clever every time.

**Three Ways to Start a Conversation (Explained Like You're Five)**

**1. The ""Look at That!"" Method (The Observation Opener)**

Remember how kids make friends? They point at things and say ""Cool!"" We're going to do exactly that, just with grown-up words.

 **Try This:**

* See something interesting? Point it out: ""That's a cool jacket!""
* Notice something unusual? Ask about it: ""Wow, this line is huge today!""
* Spot something familiar? Share it: ""Hey, is that the new iPhone? How do you like it?""

It works because you're doing two simple things:

1. Noticing something real (not making things up)
2. Inviting others to notice it too (sharing an experience)

**2. The ""Hi!"" Method (Yes, Really That Simple)**

Remember how dogs make friends? They just walk up and wag their tails. Humans can do the same thing (minus the tail wagging).

**Real Examples:**

* ""Hi! I'm \[name\]."" (Just like introducing yourself at school)
* ""Hey, how's your day going?"" (Like asking a friend about their day)
* ""Hello! Are you enjoying the event?"" (Sharing a moment, just like the airplane story)

Why this works:

1. Everyone understands ""hi""
2. It shows you're friendly (like a wagging tail!)
3. It gives them an easy way to respond

 

**3. The ""We're Both Here"" Method (The Situation Opener)**

You know how when you're both waiting in a long line, it feels natural to talk about the line? That's because you're both experiencing the same thing. Use that!

**Examples in Real Life:**

* At a coffee shop: ""What's good here? I'm still deciding.""
* At an event: ""What made you decide to come today?""
* In a bookstore: ""Have you read anything good lately?""

This works because:

1. You already have something in common
2. It's like joining a conversation that's already happening in their head
3. You're helping each other out

 

**What If They Don't Want to Play Catch?**

Sometimes, people aren't ready to play catch with words. Just like the Southwest flight, not everyone jumped in right away.

 Think of it this way: If you offer someone a cookie and they say no, is the cookie bad? Of course not! They might not be hungry, busy, or just not in the mood for cookies.

**When This Happens:**

* Smile and move on (just like offering cookies to the next person)
* Try a different approach (maybe they prefer brownies!)
* Keep practicing (you get better at baking cookies by making lots of them)

Not everyone is in the mood for a chat.  That’s ok.  You’re just opening a door.

The more you practice, the easier this becomes.  Conversations follow patterns; once you start seeing them, you’ll know what to do.

**Your Turn to Practice**

Just like Jackie Wheeler turned a quiet plane into a party, you can turn any situation into a chance to connect. Here's your homework:

1. Pick ONE method (don't overcomplicate it!)
2. Try it TODAY (not tomorrow, not next week)
3. Notice what happens (like a scientist doing an experiment)

Remember: You're not trying to create a perfect conversation. You're just throwing the ball to start the game.

**P.S.** This week is going to be a series on the fundamentals of great conversation. I am writing this to myself.  Breaking down what I think are the essential building blocks of good conversations.  Putting it here keeps me accountable and if it helps anyone else that’s a bonus.  As always, if you have comments, please do let me know. ",12,1739204175.0,socialskills,1,0.94,False

 Think of it this way: If you offer someone a cookie and they say no, is the cookie bad? Of course not! They might not be hungry, busy, or just not in the mood for cookies.

**When This Happens:**

* Smile and move on (just like offering cookies to the next person)
* Try a different approach (maybe they prefer brownies!)
* Keep practicing (you get better at baking cookies by making lots of them)

Not everyone is in the mood for a chat.  That’s ok.  You’re just opening a door.

The more you practice, the easier this becomes.  Conversations follow patterns; once you start seeing them, you’ll know what to do.

**Your Turn to Practice**

Just like Jackie Wheeler turned a quiet plane into a party, you can turn any situation into a chance to connect. Here's your homework:

1. Pick ONE method (don't overcomplicate it!)
2. Try it TODAY (not tomorrow, not next week)
3. Notice what happens (like a scientist doing an experiment)

Remember: You're not trying to create a perfect conversation. You're just throwing the ball to start the game.

**P.S.** This week is going to be a series on the fundamentals of great conversation. I am writing this to myself.  Breaking down what I think are the essential building blocks of good conversations.  Putting it here keeps me accountable and if it helps anyone else that’s a bonus.  As always, if you have comments, please do let me know. ",3,1739204163.0,communicationskills,0,1.0,False

I am a 35 (F) and I live in the Bed-stuy/Bushwick area. As much as it's fun to go to places around here, I can't seem to find female friends who would do anything apart from bar hopping. I have recently quit alcohol and would love to meet/make new friends. I love fashion, thrifting, collecting watches, going on walks, good food and I love making art. It's already hard to make friends in my 30s. Would love to meet up for coffee or N/A drinks if you are down for it!! DM me if you are interested ❤️",15,1739204158.0,NYCbitcheswithtaste,1,0.89,False

1im9spz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1im9spz/today_is_day_1/,Today is day 1⭐️,"Today is my first official day. I’ve been weaning off trying to prepare and today, I’m ready. I spent about a decade in the bottle, and for the last year and a half I’ve made a solid effort towards sobriety. 

When I started this journey a year and a half ago, I was miserable and beaten down. I was white knuckling quitting because I felt like I had to do it, not like I wanted to do it. I had intense withdrawals that scared me into doing it. And I felt major improvement during my very first attempt, but after the pink cloud faded, so did my motivation and I went back to it slowly but surely. 

Now after countless therapy sessions, psych appointments, and an abundance of self exploration, I finally woke up today and said “this is it.” 

I woke up early⭐️
I enjoyed two cups of coffee while the sun rose, and read posts on this group⭐️
I washed the dishes from this weekend⭐️
I made biscuits and gravy for my partner and I (don’t mean to brag but she said it was my best batch ever😉)⭐️
And now I’m settling in for my workday. 

I’m dedicated to starting off on the right foot today. I’m grateful for a change in my mindset. I’m grateful to feel like I WANT to quit drinking. I deserve so much more from myself. I could be so much happier and healthier. I’m done working against myself and I’m ready to demand more out of life. I can forgive myself for my past blunders and move forward. I’ve smoked weed daily for a decade and that stops today too. I’ve learned (over and over, if I’m being honest) that I’m better off leaving both behind at the same time. Otherwise one will lead to the other. 

A few things I’m looking forward to over the next few weeks are:
Better poops, as you all have mentioned😂
Sleeping through the night
Hangover free mornings
More consistent habits
More free time 
An increase in mindfulness and inner peace
Self forgiveness

I’m ready and I’m patient. I vow to make today, the first sober day of many.
