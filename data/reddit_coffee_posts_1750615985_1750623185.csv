Celebrity vs. Influencer: Same Faces, Different Filters

There’s a paper-thin line—like tissue-paper thin—between being a celebrity and being an influencer in Zambia. One day someone’s modeling in a music video, the next they’re reviewing chitenge jackets or hosting a “Girls in Tech” panel like they invented WiFi. You’ll see the same 7 faces in every ad campaign, launch event, TV guest appearance, and “influencer brunch.” They’re the entire entertainment industry on rotation. We’re honestly just waiting for one of them to start releasing gospel music—because that’s the final Voltron form.

Facebook Celefluencers: Welcome to the Digital Komboni

If there’s a digital komboni, it’s Facebook—the undisputed hood of influencer culture.
These celefluencers don’t sleep.
Their feeds are a war zone of:
	•	Petty beefs with “haters”
	•	Car keys on the dashboard with captions like “When God says yes…”
	•	Mysterious trips to Dubai (we’re not sure if it’s leisure or “leisure”)
	•	Loud callouts to “fake friends” and “snakes in my circle”
	•	Passive-aggressive Bible quotes every Monday

One minute they’re promoting a “Zambian organic skin care brand,” the next they’re threatening to leak someone’s nudes on a Live video. It’s giving Hustler’s Spirit, but with no PR manager. Half the time you’re wondering if they’re brand ambassadors or just… emotionally unstable. But one thing’s for sure—they’ve perfected the art of main character syndrome.

Instagram: The Land of Soft Life™

Now cross over to Instagram and boom—you’ve entered the Land of Pastels and Facetune.

This is where the Rich Kids of Ibex & Roma reside.
	•	Some inherited soft life from birth
	•	Some are working hard to appear soft
	•	And others are just minding their business but unfortunately have good skin, so everyone’s in their DMs

You’ve got the Insta Baddies—fully beat, booked, and sipping iced coffee in front of unfinished construction sites posing like it’s Santorini. But the guys?
We still don’t have a solid term. Insta Bros? Insta Blessables? Insta Mandem™? Either way, they’re always flexing foreign sneakers, taking mirror selfies in gyms, and dating each other’s girlfriends silently.

Most of them say they’re “creatives,” “media consultants,” or “entrepreneurs,” but their real job descriptions are:
	•	Being cute
	•	Getting paid in USD by obscure skincare brands from Turkey
	•	Occasionally DJing at a pool party no one remembers

They tag every photo #BrandAmbassador even if it’s just a free juice they were given at a launch.

Twitter Keyboard Warriors: The Digital Think Tanks

Over on Zed Twitter, it’s a whole parliament of philosophers, debaters, and digital militants.

These folks don’t pose. They post.
With essays.
At 2AM.
About politics, economics, relationship ethics, and why your favorite influencer is “not deep enough.”
But recently, some of them have tried migrating to Facebook, where their poetic threads now turn into comment-section debates with uncles who type in all caps.

Few have truly crossed over—like ➖➖➖—a rare species that’s respected across all platforms. We call that platform fluidity, baby.

Reddit: The Silent Assassins

Then there’s Zambian Reddit, the underground layer of the internet.
These people say NOTHING in public, but they know everything. They’re sipping tea with burner accounts and just tryna make a solid connection online. 

They may argue but they don’t fight—they link sources.
If the other platforms are a stage, Reddit is the dressing room—where all the drama gets dissected before it goes live again.

Final Thoughts: One Zambia, Many Characters

From Facebook’s digital Komboni celebrities to Instagram’s soft-life olympians, Twitter’s political philosophers, and Reddit’s quiet chaos agents, Zambia’s influencer/celebrity culture is the most entertaining soap opera that doesn’t need a budget. No matter the platform, they’re all performing—some with ring lights, others with receipts.

But whether you’re laughing, liking, or hate-sharing…
You’re watching.

I grabbed the chocolate and banana flavors because I work in IT and sometimes I literally forget to eat while coding or sitting through back-to-back meetings. I thought it would taste chalky or be hard on my stomach, but it actually mixes better than I expected (used a regular shaker bottle with cold water), and it kept me full till dinner.

What surprised me most is how consistent my energy felt through the afternoon. Normally I crash after a heavy lunch or coffee, but this gave me just enough to stay focused. I’m still skeptical about replacing full meals long-term, but for something fast and balanced during the week, it’s working out better than sandwiches or skipping lunch entirely.

I’m curious, though, anyone else using Huel regularly for a while now? Does it stay sustainable or do you burn out on the taste after a few weeks?",1,1750622906.0,productreview,0,1.0,False

What surprised me is how smooth everything feels. The daily cashback shows up fast, and I’ve already used some of it toward a coffee. I also like how it breaks down spending by color categories, it actually helped me see how much I was blowing on food delivery.

That said, it’s not perfect. It doesn’t give 1.5% or 2% on general purchases like some other cards do, and it doesn’t have a real signup bonus either. If you’re not deep into the Apple ecosystem, I feel like it wouldn’t be that useful. But for someone like me who pays everything through Apple Pay already, it’s kinda perfect.

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

•	⁠Photography? Not art. It’s just a button.
•	⁠Digital painting? Not real. It’s witchcraft with a stylus.
•	⁠Generative AI? Definitely theft. Jail time.

Okay then - Cinema? Everyone copied the Lumière brothers. Flight? Inspired by Da Vinci’s sketches. Electricity? Tesla wasn’t the only one experimenting. Art movements? All built on each other like a never-ending remix.

And coffee makers? Thieves! Stole fire’s idea of brewing. Microwaves? Literally plagiarizing the sun.

Most artists learn by copying others. That’s literally how art schools work. But if your tool is an AI instead of a paintbrush, suddenly it’s “just imitation.” Just like they said about photography. And digital art. And animation. And 3D. And - you get the idea.

Here’s the thing though - AI doesn’t copy pixel-by-pixel any more than human artists do. When you learn to paint like Van Gogh, you’re not tracing „Starry Night” - you’re absorbing brushwork patterns, color relationships, and compositional approaches, then applying them to something entirely new. AI does the same thing, just with a different type of processing. It synthesizes learned patterns through the lens of your specific prompt, creating something that never existed before. The „copying” criticism misunderstands how the technology actually works.

You can’t steal aesthetics. You can’t steal philosophy. You can’t steal the fabric of meaning - even if you reshape it with code.

I’ve just spent a month on Reddit getting roasted for “AI plagiarism,” “killing art,” and “expressing opinions that shouldn’t exist.”

But now I’m here -  with you. A bunch of weirdos who actually get it.

*Mitragyna speciosa*, commonly known as Kratom, is a tropical tree with a history spanning centuries, evolving from a culturally integrated traditional remedy in Southeast Asia to a globally recognized substance of interest and controversy. This research paper provides an in-depth historical analysis, tracing Kratom's botanical origins, its formal scientific discovery, and the evolution of its pharmacological understanding. It examines the deep ethnobotanical roots and diverse traditional uses across Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, contrasting these with its relatively recent and rapid global dissemination, largely driven by modern public health challenges such as the opioid crisis. The report further explores the complex and often contradictory regulatory responses in both native and Western countries, highlighting how economic factors, scientific ambiguity, and public perception have shaped its legal status. Finally, it details the historical and contemporary accounts of Kratom's adverse effects, addiction potential, and withdrawal syndrome, emphasizing the amplified risks associated with an unregulated market and the critical ongoing need for comprehensive scientific research to inform future policy and public health strategies.

**1. Introduction**

*Mitragyna speciosa*, universally recognized as Kratom, stands as a compelling botanical specimen, a tropical tree indigenous to the lush landscapes of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Belonging to the Rubiaceae family, which also includes the ubiquitous coffee tree, Kratom can attain impressive dimensions, reaching heights of up to 50 feet with a canopy spread exceeding 15 feet. The leaves of this tree are notable for their rich array of bioactive alkaloids, with mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine identified as the primary compounds responsible for its distinctive psychoactive properties. The trajectory of Kratom's influence has transformed dramatically over time, transitioning from a localized traditional remedy, deeply woven into the fabric of indigenous cultures, to a global phenomenon that now commands the attention of consumers, researchers, and regulatory bodies worldwide.  

The purpose of this paper is to offer a comprehensive historical examination of Kratom. This analysis will meticulously trace its journey from its ancient ethnobotanical roots and traditional applications to its formal scientific recognition, the evolving understanding of its pharmacology, and its subsequent global dissemination. Furthermore, the discussion will encompass the intricate and often contentious regulatory landscape that has emerged in response to its increasing prevalence. A central theme in this historical narrative is the fundamental divergence in how Kratom is perceived and utilized across different geographies. In its native lands, it has maintained a long-standing, culturally integrated role, serving both practical and ceremonial purposes for centuries. In stark contrast, its relatively recent emergence in Western nations, largely beginning in the early 2000s and accelerating in the 2010s , has been marked by significant controversy and a focus on its psychoactive properties and potential for dependence. This stark contrast in perception and application forms a central tension throughout Kratom's history, highlighting its complex identity.  

The classification of Kratom as a ""natural"" substance, owing to its botanical origin, further contributes to a nuanced and occasionally misinformed public understanding, particularly within Western societies. While the plant's natural provenance is undeniable, as it is derived directly from a tropical tree , regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued warnings regarding its ""potential for addiction, abuse, and dependence"" and the risk of ""serious adverse events"". The observation that a substance is not inherently safer simply because it is natural challenges a common misconception that has influenced its adoption in new markets. This situation underscores a broader societal challenge in distinguishing between traditional herbal remedies, which often have a context of long-term local knowledge, and unregulated psychoactive substances entering new consumer environments. The historical narrative of Kratom thus reveals a complex interplay between traditional wisdom, scientific discovery, and evolving societal perceptions.  

**2. Botanical Origins and Early Ethnobotanical History**

The foundational history of Kratom is rooted in its botanical classification and its deep cultural integration within the indigenous communities of Southeast Asia.

**2.1. Classification and Native Habitat**

Kratom, formally identified as *Mitragyna speciosa* (korth), is a tropical tree classified within the Rubiaceae family, which notably includes the coffee tree. The genus name,  

*Mitragyna*, is derived from the distinctive resemblance of its leaves to a bishop's ceremonial hat, known as a miter. This evergreen tree is indigenous to the warm, humid climates and fertile soils characteristic of Southeast Asia, flourishing particularly in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia (including Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi, and Kalimantan), Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea. Related species within the  

*Mitragyna* genus have a broader geographical distribution, extending as far as India and South Africa.  

**2.2. Earliest Documented Mentions and Formal Discovery**

The earliest references to Kratom's use in Western medical literature date back to 1836, where its application as an opium substitute in Malaysia was noted. The formal botanical description of  

*Mitragyna speciosa* was provided in 1839 by the Dutch colonial botanist Pieter Willem Korthals, who initially named the species *Stephegyne speciosa*. The plant subsequently underwent several reclassifications before George Darby Haviland established its final name and classification in 1859.  

While 1836 marks the first Western documentation, the traditional use of Kratom in Southeast Asia is believed to extend much further into the past, potentially to prehistoric times. This earlier use is suggested by enduring oral traditions and archaeological evidence. For instance, Dutch colonizers arriving in Southeast Asia in the 17th century documented local inhabitants chewing the leaves to enhance productivity and alleviate pain. This historical context highlights that the plant's utility was recognized and integrated into local cultures long before its formal scientific classification by Western botanists.  

**2.3. Traditional Uses and Cultural Significance in Southeast Asia**

For many centuries, Kratom has been an integral component of traditional medicine and cultural practices throughout Southeast Asia. The initial widespread adoption of Kratom was largely driven by its utility in mitigating the demanding conditions of manual labor and addressing common health ailments, rather than a primary pursuit of recreational effects. Its primary traditional application was as a stimulant for laborers and farmers in Thailand and Malaysia, assisting them in overcoming the arduousness of hard work, boosting energy levels, and alleviating muscle strains. Workers commonly chewed fresh leaves to combat fatigue and enhance productivity and endurance during long hours in the fields. In certain Thai communities, the saying ""Strong as a kratom chewer"" emerged, symbolizing endurance and resilience, which further underscores the plant's role in supporting strenuous physical activity.  

Beyond its stimulant properties, Kratom held significant value in traditional medicine. It was historically employed in Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and Malaysia, as a substitute for opium when the latter was unavailable, and to manage the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. This pragmatic application in managing addiction, especially in contexts where conventional treatments were scarce, highlights its functional importance. Furthermore, Kratom was widely used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain, muscle aches, and chronic pain. Traditional healers and communities also utilized Kratom for a diverse range of ailments, including coughs, diarrhea, intestinal infections (serving as deworming agents), diabetes, fever, and as a poultice for wounds.  

The use of Kratom was deeply embedded in the cultural and social fabric of these communities. It played a role in social rituals, such as being offered as a ""snack to receive guests"" in Thailand or as a sign of hospitality in Malaysia. Communal consumption was often part of rituals aimed at strengthening community bonds. In some animistic belief systems, Kratom was revered as a sacred plant, believed to be a gift from spirits. Shamans and spiritual leaders reportedly used it to achieve altered states of consciousness, facilitating communication with ancestral and nature spirits. In Malay culture, Kratom was associated with the concept of ""semangat,"" referring to the life force or soul, with the belief that its consumption could enhance an individual's resilience to life's challenges. The cultivation and harvesting of Kratom were frequently accompanied by specific rituals and beliefs, such as the practice of harvesting leaves in the early morning. The herb itself is notably bitter, and traditionally, it was often combined with a sweetener to improve palatability. It is important to note that, prior to the 2000s, there is no scientific documentation of traditional uses of Kratom preparations outside of Asia. This indicates that the plant's deep integration into local cultures meant its knowledge was largely self-contained, and its eventual global spread represented a disruptive phenomenon, leading to a lack of established understanding and regulatory frameworks in new contexts.  

Even in traditional contexts, an implicit understanding of Kratom's biphasic, dose-dependent effects was evident. While not articulated in pharmacological terms, descriptions of Kratom being used as a ""stimulant"" for work at lower doses and for ""pain relief"" or ""calming effects"" at higher doses demonstrate an experiential recognition of its varied effects based on quantity. The phrase ""Strong as a kratom chewer"" for endurance, contrasted with its use for ""relaxation and social rituals"" , further supports this observation. This early, empirical understanding of dose-dependency provided a practical foundation for later scientific investigations into its complex pharmacology.

**3. Traditional Cultivation, Harvesting, and Preparation Methods**

The historical interaction of indigenous communities with Kratom involved specific practices for its cultivation, harvesting, and preparation, reflecting a deep, empirical understanding of the plant's properties.

**3.1. Cultivation Practices**

Kratom trees thrive in the warm and humid climates of Southeast Asia, requiring a specific combination of abundant sunlight, consistent rainfall, and rich, fertile soil. These trees are frequently found flourishing at the edges of rivers and in areas characterized by fertile alluvial soils rich in organic matter. Traditional cultivation practices involve meticulous care, with farmers typically propagating Kratom either through seeds or by taking cuttings from mature trees. Once planted, the trees require several years to reach their full maturity, during which period they are carefully nurtured with proper irrigation, organic fertilizers, and protection from pests.  

A significant aspect of traditional Kratom cultivation is the adherence to sustainable and organic farming practices. This includes the deliberate avoidance of harmful pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, which is crucial for protecting the soil quality and local water systems. Furthermore, the practice of agroforestry, where Kratom is grown alongside other crops or trees, is common. This approach not only promotes biodiversity within the agricultural system but also provides direct benefits to local communities. The cultivation of Kratom has historically served as an alternative, sustainable income opportunity for many communities, thereby reducing the reliance on more destructive land use practices such as slash-and-burn farming.  

**3.2. Harvesting Techniques**

The timing and method of harvesting Kratom leaves are critical to ensuring the potency of the plant's alkaloids. Leaves are typically selected when they are mature and have developed the highest concentration of these active compounds. Skilled harvesters, often local farmers, employ traditional methods, either hand-picking the leaves or carefully using tools to pluck them. They prioritize leaves with a vibrant green color, while avoiding those that appear damaged or diseased. Notably, the leaf veins are generally not included in the production of leaf powder, suggesting an early understanding of the distribution of active compounds within the plant.  

Kratom producers have, over centuries of trial and error, established highly accurate harvesting schedules to optimize the yield and alkaloid profile of the leaves. For example, in Kapuas Hulu, Indonesia, harvesting commences when the plants are approximately 6 months old and about 1 meter tall. During this initial harvest, older leaves are picked, while 4-6 young leaves are intentionally left on the plants to ensure continued growth. The first harvest typically yields between 0.5 to 0.75 kg per tree. Subsequent harvests occur every 1.5 to 3 months, depending on the condition of the plants, with productivity often improving by approximately 30% in the second crop and continuing to increase thereafter. For taller branches, traditional harvesters may use bamboo or rope to facilitate easier access and collection. These practices, honed over generations, demonstrate an empirical optimization of the plant's biochemistry long before formal scientific analysis.  

**3.3. Preparation Methods**

Traditionally, fresh or dried Kratom leaves were primarily consumed by chewing or by brewing them into teas. Smoking the leaves was a less common method of consumption. When chewing, traditional ""kratom eaters"" would typically masticate one to three fresh leaves at a time to achieve desired effects such as vigor and euphoria. It was common practice to remove the veins from the leaves before chewing, and sometimes salt was added, reportedly to prevent constipation. Only the masticated material was swallowed, often followed by a drink of warm water, coffee, tea, or palm sugar syrup. Regular users might engage in this practice anywhere from 3 to 10 times a day.  

For tea preparation, lemon juice was frequently added, a practice that likely facilitated the extraction of the plant's alkaloids due to the acidic environment. Sugar or honey might then be incorporated to mask the herb's inherently bitter taste. The precision in these traditional methods, such as harvesting mature leaves for higher alkaloid concentration or adding lemon juice to tea, indicates an intuitive ethnobotanical understanding of chemical solubility and bioavailability. This suggests that traditional users, through generations of observation and practice, effectively conducted their own form of ""pharmacological studies.""  

A notable development in regional consumption patterns, particularly among youth in Southeast Asia and Thailand, was the emergence of the ""4x100"" cocktail around the 2010s. This concoction typically combines Kratom leaves with cough syrup (often containing codeine), Coca-Cola, and ice. The appearance of this mixed beverage represents an early historical instance of Kratom being combined with other psychoactive substances, moving beyond the plant's singular use. This development foreshadowed later concerns about poly-drug use in Western contexts. The ""4x100"" cocktail was generally viewed more negatively than traditional Kratom use but less negatively than heroin use, indicating a societal recognition of altered risk profiles associated with such combinations. This regional precedent highlights that the potential for misuse and dangerous combinations is not exclusively a Western phenomenon but can evolve from changing consumption patterns within traditional regions.  

In Western countries, Kratom has become available in a wider variety of processed forms, including whole or crushed dried leaves, fine powder, concentrated extracts, encapsulated powder, and extract resin ""pies"" (40-gram pellets made from reduced extract). The availability of seeds and even whole trees through some online vendors also suggests the possibility of domestic cultivation outside its native habitat.

**4. Evolution of Scientific Understanding and Pharmacological Insights**

The scientific journey of Kratom has progressed from the initial isolation of its chemical components to a more nuanced understanding of its complex pharmacology, influencing perceptions of its effects over time.

**4.1. Early Chemical Isolation and Characterization**

The primary active alkaloid in Kratom, mitragynine, was first isolated from its leaves in 1921 by Ellen Field, a medicinal chemist affiliated with the University of Edinburgh. Decades later, in 1964, its chemical structure was precisely characterized using X-ray crystallography by a research group led by G.A. Jeffrey at the University of Pittsburgh. Concurrently, beginning in 1961, Joseph Shellard and Arnold Beckett at Chelsea College, London, along with their PhD students David Phillipson and Albert Tackie, embarked on extensive examinations of the chemical structures of both known and novel alkaloids found in  

*Mitragyna speciosa* and other *Mitragyna* species. Phillipson's work with Shellard notably resulted in the isolation of 16 distinct alkaloids from  

*M. speciosa* and four other *Mitragyna* species.  

Kratom leaves are known to contain at least 37 different alkaloids. Among these, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OHMG) are recognized as the two primary active components. Mitragynine is the most prevalent alkaloid, constituting approximately 2% of Kratom preparations by mass and up to 66% of the total alkaloid content. In contrast, 7-OHMG, an oxidized analog of mitragynine, is present in much smaller quantities, generally less than 0.02%. When ingested, mitragynine is metabolized in the body, breaking down into 7-hydroxymitragynine.  

**4.2. Historical Perceptions of Effects**

Early scientific investigations into whole Kratom extracts provided initial insights into its effects. These studies indicated that the extract exerted a stimulant effect in both humans and animals, described as ""comparable to cocaine,"" but only a ""weak analgesic effect equivalent in potency to that of codeine"". Historically, users also reported experiencing a ""high"" after ingesting Kratom, which contributed to its recreational use.  

The use of Kratom in Southeast Asia has been documented for at least 150 years, dating back to 1836. Throughout this period, traditional accounts consistently described a stimulant effect when fresh leaves were chewed, typically for enhancing performance during hard labor. Conversely, an analgesic and relaxing effect was observed when the leaves were brewed into a tea. This historical understanding aligns with modern observations of dose-dependent effects: at low doses, typically 1-5 grams, Kratom produces stimulant effects, with users reporting increased alertness, physical energy, talkativeness, and sociable behavior. At higher doses, generally 5-15 grams, opioid-like effects become predominant, accompanied by sedative and euphoric sensations. The onset of these effects typically occurs within 5 to 10 minutes after ingestion and can last for 2 to 5 hours.  

**4.3. Modern Pharmacological Discoveries**

Modern pharmacological studies have significantly advanced the understanding of Kratom's mechanisms of action. These studies reveal that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine primarily exert their effects through mu-opioid receptor agonist activity. Beyond this, they also interact with delta opioid receptors, as well as alpha 2 adrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors. Animal studies have even suggested that Kratom may be more potent than morphine in certain contexts.  

A particularly significant discovery in modern pharmacology is that while mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine act as partial agonists for mu-opioid receptors, their activity notably lacks beta-arrestin 2 recruitment. This is a crucial distinction, as beta-arrestin signaling has been associated with many of the undesirable effects of classical opioid receptor activation, including constipation, respiratory depression, and dependence. This unique pharmacological profile is hypothesized to explain Kratom's anecdotal ability to induce less respiratory depression and potentially reduced euphoric effects compared to widely abused opioids like heroin or morphine. This progression in scientific understanding, moving from simply identifying compounds to elucidating their precise mechanisms of action at a molecular level, is critical for explaining the observed dose-dependent effects and the nuanced differences from classical opioids.  

Historically, there was pharmaceutical interest in Kratom's alkaloids. In the 1960s, the pharmacy company Smith Kline French (which later merged into GlaxoSmithKline) explored the possibility of developing mitragynine as a painkiller to replace morphine. However, this development was ultimately halted because toxicity tests revealed that mitragynine was toxic to beagle dogs. This early commercial interest and subsequent abandonment illustrate the historical challenges inherent in translating traditional remedies into modern pharmaceuticals. It demonstrates that while Kratom's therapeutic potential was recognized early on, the complexities of its pharmacology and safety profile, even for isolated compounds, presented significant hurdles for conventional drug development, a situation that continues to inform current debates about its safety and efficacy, particularly given the lack of FDA approval for any medical use.  

Modern research also highlights that Kratom's effects can vary widely depending on several factors, including the amount taken, the product's potency (concentration and strength), its specific formulation, the method of ingestion, the presence of other drugs in a person's system, and individual physiological factors. The concentration and combination of specific Kratom compounds within a product also significantly influence the resulting effects. It is important to acknowledge that scientific research on Kratom is relatively nascent compared to studies on more widely used drugs. Consequently, much remains unknown about its various chemical compounds, the full spectrum of its short- and long-term health impacts, and its potential therapeutic applications.

**5. The Global Spread and Modern Landscape of Kratom Use**

The trajectory of Kratom's use shifted dramatically as it moved beyond its native Southeast Asian regions, becoming a globally recognized, albeit controversial, substance.

**5.1. Introduction to Western Countries**

While Kratom's traditional use in Southeast Asia spans centuries, its documented presence and widespread adoption in the United States are relatively recent phenomena, with initial cases emerging in the early 2000s. Although botanists like Pieter Willem Korthals introduced Kratom to the Western Hemisphere in the 19th century , its significant popularization outside of Asia is a distinctly modern development. By 2015, Kratom products were readily available in outlets such as head shops and through online vendors in the U.S.. The prevalence of its use subsequently experienced a rapid increase between 2011 and 2017. By 2020, estimates suggested that approximately 15 million people in the U.S. were using Kratom. Similar increases in sales have also been observed across Europe and North America.  

**5.2. Drivers of Modern Popularity**

A primary impetus for Kratom's burgeoning popularity in Western countries has been its perceived utility for self-treatment of various conditions. This is particularly evident in its use for managing chronic pain and alleviating opioid withdrawal symptoms. Many individuals have turned to Kratom as an alternative to conventional pain medications, seeking a ""natural"" solution for persistent pain conditions. The opioid epidemic in Western countries, especially the United States, significantly catalyzed Kratom's introduction and widespread adoption as a perceived natural alternative. The rapid increase in Kratom use in the U.S. between 2011 and 2017 directly coincided with a period of heightened awareness and increased regulation of prescription opioids. The explicit linking of Kratom's growth to the time when ""opioids began to become more regulated in the 2010s"" points to a direct causal relationship. This suggests that a public health crisis, namely the opioid epidemic, created a substantial demand for alternatives, which Kratom, despite its unregulated status, began to fulfill due to its perceived opioid-like effects and accessibility.  

Beyond pain and withdrawal, Kratom is also used to address symptoms of mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Furthermore, some users seek its stimulant effects for increased energy, alertness, talkativeness, and sociability, or for enhanced productivity and focus in academic or professional settings. A 2020 survey indicated that over 50% of users reported employing Kratom for its energy-boosting effects. Another survey of 2,798 users found that 41% utilized Kratom to cease or reduce prescription or illicit opioid use, with 411 individuals attributing over a year of continuous opioid abstinence to Kratom consumption. The perception that Kratom offers comparable pain relief to opioids but with a potentially lower risk of addiction has also contributed to its rising popularity.  

**5.3. Evolution of Kratom Products and Availability**

The modern Kratom market has seen a diversification of product forms beyond the traditional raw leaves. Consumers can now find Kratom in various preparations, including whole or crushed leaves, fine powder, concentrated extracts, encapsulated powder, and even extract resin ""pies"". The availability of Kratom seeds and even whole trees through online vendors suggests the growing possibility of domestic cultivation in non-native regions.  

A notable development in the market is the significant growth of Kratom-infused beverages, with products such as seltzers and shots now emerging. Of particular concern is the marketing of products containing highly concentrated forms of 7-hydroxymitragynine. This represents a significant shift from the consumption of the whole plant, where 7-OHMG is naturally present only in trace amounts. The critical detail is that 7-OHMG has been identified as being ""14-22 times more potent than morphine"" , and some commercially available Kratom products have been found to contain ""notably elevated concentrations of 7-hydroxymitragynine"" compared to natural leaves. This innovation in product formulation introduces new and potentially more dangerous consumption patterns, as it bypasses the natural balance of alkaloids found in the plant, thereby increasing the risk of dependence and addiction. This creates a new category of risk that was not encountered in traditional use patterns and presents a considerable challenge for regulators attempting to classify ""Kratom"" as a singular entity.  

**5.4. Shifting Perceptions and Controversies**

Kratom's transition from a localized traditional remedy to a globally debated substance is marked by a complex interplay of shifting perceptions. While proponents advocate for its therapeutic potential in pain management and opioid withdrawal, critics emphasize the notable absence of rigorous, large-scale clinical studies and the inherent potential for misuse.  

A significant factor influencing its modern adoption is the belief that Kratom is a safe, herbal alternative. This perception, however, is often misleading, as it can lead users to underestimate the substance's pharmacological potency and its potential for addiction. The rapid global dissemination of Kratom into Western markets occurred in an information vacuum regarding its long-term effects and safety. The repeated assertion that ""there is no scientific information on traditional uses of Kratom preparations before the 2000s outside of Asia"" is critical. This absence of pre-existing scientific or medical understanding meant that when Kratom entered Western markets, there was little established knowledge of its effects, risks, or traditional context. This vacuum allowed for the proliferation of anecdotal claims and marketing strategies that frequently oversimplified its safety. The lack of comprehensive regulation and clear labeling further exacerbated this issue, contributing to a ""misleading safety"" perception. This situation demonstrates how the absence of established scientific and regulatory frameworks can create an environment conducive to misinformation and underestimated risks as a traditional substance transitions into a new global context.  

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken a firm stance, classifying Kratom as an ""unapproved new dietary ingredient"" and issuing warnings to consumers to avoid its use due to documented risks of serious adverse events, including liver toxicity, seizures, and substance use disorder. This highlights the ongoing scientific and regulatory debate surrounding Kratom's place in modern society.

So I politely asked her to ""please ask before taking a drink"". This was met with backlash. 

I tried to explain it was because I wanted to make sure the drinks went out in the correct order. As the customer who ordered first should get their drink first. But also because some drinks were missing ingredients.

Moving it even a few feet on a rug was a full-on two-person mission.

If you’re someone who likes rearranging furniture? Think twice.

# Storage shelves = clutter magnets

This one had a lower shelf that *looked* great in the photos.

In real life? It became a black hole for candles, remotes, dog toys, and random junk.

Looks neat for a week. Then chaos.

# Real wood = real variation

Photos online never quite match what shows up.

Color, grain pattern, even the feel under your fingers can be way different.

That’s not always bad, but if you’re a symmetry/control freak, it might bug you

In short: real wood furniture looks amazing, but it’s not low-maintenance or plug-and-play.

You have to take care of it or be okay with it aging fast.

In this article, I’ll show why you should seriously consider adding the iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF ($SHY) to your portfolio.



1.       **What is SHY?**  
$SHY is an exchange-traded fund managed by BlackRock. It primarily holds short-term (1–3 year) U.S. Treasury bonds — making it one of the safest fixed-income instruments on the market.



2.      A strong management team and sound investment process underpin ETF's Morningstar Medalist Rating of Bronze

3.      Think of SHY as ""proxy cash.""

Historically, SHY experiences very low drawdowns, especially compared to equities. It’s not just about yield—it's about preserving capital with minimal volatility.

https://preview.redd.it/g8bvdt69aj8f1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=16eebe94c7955f8bc43be39d22fe272acbd9bfe9

 

4.      Trading with IBKR? This matters even more.

If your account’s net asset value (NAV) is under $320,000, SHY can help you optimize returns. That’s because Interactive Brokers pays lower interest on idle cash for smaller accounts.

https://preview.redd.it/4p3v6iibaj8f1.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=016effc718bbf49739c1cb09e104017a40a11f1c



5.      Let’s run the numbers.

If your NAV is $200,000:

·        Holding idle cash? You’ll earn \~**1.53%**

·        Holding SHY instead? You’ll earn \~**4%**  
That’s a meaningful difference—especially over time.   

https://preview.redd.it/hu0j614daj8f1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=d88fdcc6de4d9fc3718ef2a7d62355da0906c08e

6.      Low Expense Ratio. With an expense ratio of just 0.15%, SHY is cost-effective, allowing investors to keep more of their returns.

 

7.      Low Interest Rate Risk. By focusing on short-term bonds, SHY exhibits low sensitivity to interest rate changes. Its modified duration is around 1.8 years, helping to minimize price volatility compared to a longer-duration bond fund.

  

8.      Real-life example.

 Imagine you are in July 2017 and you are holding 100% in S&P500 index. Adding 20% of SHY to your portfolio will change the context of COVID crash significantly. You will still get the same ROI, but with a much lower drawdown.

https://preview.redd.it/qeapds4iaj8f1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=084949d0a82f5b36e8e3fb625241462c98109e33



9.      Final thoughts.

Once the S&P 500 breaks through its all-time high (currently \~6,147), it may be smart to hedge selectively, particularly for investors near retirement or those anticipating major expenses.

 

Personally, while I’m not aggressively loading up on SHY right now, I’ve allocated a portion of my idle cash into it. This improves my portfolio’s ROI while I continue scouting high-potential equity opportunities.



10.   **TL;DR:**✅ Low risk  
✅ Better yield than cash  
✅ Useful hedge in uncertain markets

Don’t you smell it? The bitterness in the air,  
The darkness brewing… oh, it’s everywhere.  
  
\[Verse 1\]  
(Sung by The Coffee Maker, smooth and menacing)  
Don’t you hear her, Noctis, in the silence of the night?  
A whisper in the shadows, a flicker out of sight.  
Her voice seeps in like poison, her laughter’s in your veins,  
She’s haunting every moment, driving you insane.  
  
\[Chorus\]  
(Sung, mocking and jazzy, with a sinister edge)  
Drip, drip, the pot runs dry,  
Nightmares brew, and the clock won’t lie.  
Can you taste it, Noctis, the fear she feeds?  
She’s the queen of your dreams, the one you need.  
  
\[Verse 2\]  
(Sung, leaning closer to Sam, almost whispering at times)  
You thought you trapped her, locked her away,  
But listen close—she’s never far away.  
A prisoner of time? Oh, she laughed at that game.  
Now her power’s rising, and you’re to blame.  
  
\[Bridge  
(Spoken, taunting, over dissonant piano chords)  
Don’t you feel it, Sam? The weight of her gaze?  
She’s watching, waiting… counting the days.  
  
(Sung, with building intensity)  
Her footsteps echo in the corridors of your mind,  
The trap you set for her… it’s left you blind.

Drip, drip, the pot runs dry,  
Nightmares brew, and the clock won’t lie.  
Can you taste it, Noctis, the fear she feeds?  
She’s the queen of your dreams, the one you need.  
  
\[Outro\]  
(Sung softly, with a chilling smile in his voice)  
So, Sam, what will you do when the coffee grows cold?  
When the nightmares consume, and her story’s retold?  
You hear her now, don’t you, in the dead of the night?

Very consistent, always present and available and his family knew about me. I felt it was genuine and am shocked how things have turned out. He even told his family about me and spoke of marriage.

A few weeks ago, I discovered he had been secretly communicating with his ex behind my back when we were navigating conflicts in our relationship (texting for a month; met for park walks, coffee, dinner and swears no physical touch). When I confronted him, he confessed everything. He said he wanted a friend and validation, but eventually blocked her and wanted to work on us. I decided to walk away because I could no longer trust him after that betrayal.

I haven’t responded to his messages in over a week. It oscillates between FWB requests and trying to make mends. I’m curious — if this happened to you, what would you do? Especially if the connection once felt real and sacred?",2,1750622088.0,datingoverforty,5,0.67,False

For longer tables, I always include a middle support between the legs; either 2 2x4s across the legs or a 5th leg in the middle when using steel pipes for the base.

I've been mostly stable for the last 2 year and a half (only some mild ups and downs, but nothing comparable to what I had before getting diagnosed with bp2).
Right now it's been 3 weeks that my therapist and my gf are noticing I'm in an apparently really elevated mood, but I don't think I'm checking the boxes to meet a hypomanic episode yet.
I'm feeling really good right now, I've got a new interest involving storm chasing and weather forecasting (I live in Europe, so there isn't the crazy stuff the us have to deal with), but I haven't spent money on it (except for gas to go to places to observe supercells).
I may have tore apart and upgraded most of the 3d printers I have at the school I work at, but again they were all up to work when they were needed for lessons. My coworkers told me as well I look more hyper than normal when I started tearing a part some of the school's CNC machines to clean them.

“No more sugar, drink water.” We made dinner and he would not eat the dinner and demanded macaroni and cheese. He told his mom he was starving, who told my girlfriend that I need to make him macaroni and cheese. So I did.

1lhwis6,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1lhwis6/i_feel_so_peaceful_and_calm_after_quitting_coffee/,I feel so peaceful and calm after quitting coffee. WOW!,"It’s been a few months since I quit coffee, and I can’t believe how quiet my world has become. Not boring quiet. Not empty quiet. But a deep, steady, life-changing kind of quiet. A calm I had no idea I was missing.

Before, I was constantly buzzing. Even when I thought I was relaxed, there was always a tightness in my chest, a jittery edge to everything. Mornings felt like a race from the second I woke up. My thoughts were quick, scattered, loud. I was always preparing, bracing, overanalyzing. There was a pressure I carried every single day, and I thought it was just part of being human in a stressful world.

But now that I’m off coffee, that pressure is gone. And the thing that’s taken its place is something I don’t even have the perfect word for. It’s a quiet mind. It’s a soft heart. It’s a body that doesn’t feel like it’s clenching all the time. I feel still, but not sluggish. Awake, but not wired. Just calm. Calm in a way that goes all the way to the core.

One of the most unexpected changes has been with my anxiety, especially around work and social situations. I used to feel a rush of nerves before meetings, calls, or even casual conversations. I would get this wave of self-consciousness, this need to over-prepare and second-guess myself. I always thought that was just my personality.

But now it’s just not there. I show up to conversations feeling clear and steady. I speak without rehearsing. I get emails and I respond like a normal person, not someone spiraling through imagined consequences. I’m not jumpy anymore. I’m not on edge. I just feel capable. I feel calm.

At work, I can focus without forcing it. I can start a task without needing a surge of caffeine-fueled adrenaline. I’m more patient, more present. And when the day is over, I still have energy left, because I haven’t been burning it all on anxiety and overstimulation.

Socially, I feel more open. I don’t dread interactions or analyze everything I said afterward. I can be with people and actually enjoy the moment, because my nervous system isn’t stuck in high alert. There’s a gentleness now that I carry into everything, and it feels like a gift I didn’t know I could give myself.

And maybe one of the most surprising things of all is how different my days feel now. Without coffee, time doesn’t fly by in a blur of urgency. The hours stretch out in a way that feels generous. I move through the day at a more natural pace, without rushing or chasing anything. I notice more. I feel more. I’m not constantly trying to catch up or “push through” the next thing. I have space to breathe, to pause, to simply exist. Even ordinary moments... walking outside, washing dishes, reading, etc. feel fuller, more grounded, more real. It’s like life has stopped rushing past me, and now I get to actually live in it.

Quitting coffee didn’t just remove something from my life. It gave me something so much better in return. A clear mind. A grounded body. A peaceful inner world.

If you’re thinking about quitting, or if you’re in the rough stretch right now, hold on. It really is worth it. There is something waiting on the other side that is quieter, kinder, and more beautiful than I ever expected.

I feel like I finally came home to myself. And the best part is, it’s peaceful here.

Has anyone else felt this kind of calm since quitting? I’d love to hear your experience.",18,1750620898.0,decaf,5,1.0,False

I’m a pretty easygoing 30 year old guy who’s just as down for spontaneous adventures as I am for a laid-back night in with good food and better company. I'm 6’0"", white, blonde (yep, like my username), wear glasses, usually clean-shaven but giving the summer beard experiment a go right now. Physically active and in solid shape at 195 lbs—happy to swap pics once we’re chatting.

When I’m not chasing sunbeams or iced coffee, I’m usually planning my next trip. Travel has been a big part of my life lately, and I’ve got some exciting plans lined up for Asia and Europe next year. I also want to check out more of the West Coast and Midwest.

Live music is a big love of mine. Whether it’s a packed venue or an outdoor summer show, I’m always down to see a band I love. My playlists bounce around from alt rock to electro to indie, but I'm open to almost anything—even country if you've got the right track to convert me. Oh, and I’ve been learning salsa… slowly. Let’s just say I’ve got the enthusiasm down, the steps are a work in progress

Outside of that, I’m a big fan of manga, the occasional anime, and I’m deep into board games and indie video games. Slay the Spire, Hades, and Fallout: New Vegas are my current favorites. I also like cooking (especially seasonal recipes), baking, dancing, a bit of swimming and being cozy.

If any of that sounds like your kind of energy, I’d love to hear from you. Looking to connect with someone 24+ preferably on the East Coast—but if you're elsewhere in the US and we click, I’m open to seeing where it goes.

My 75 hard goals are just to get some form of movement daily, drink at least 2 big bottles of water daily, and to keep up with my bar exam daily study tasks (8-10 hours daily).

What’s going well:
- eating 100+ g protein daily (aiming for 120+, but minimum 100 g)
- (trainer’s rec) increasing fiber via berries, zucchini, potatoes, olipops occasionally 
- eating fruit riot! frozen grape candies or 100 cal coconut ice cream bars at night whenever I get craving for sour candy or sweets
- 1500~ calories daily. I haven’t been feeling too hungry and I think the high protein has been helping significantly 
- 23 g protein okios smoothie drinks (140 cal)
- chicken bone broth (40 cal/8 g protein)
- 110 cal popcorn bags when I want to watch tv
- fav lunch: low-carb spinach wrap, genoa salami, laughing cow vegan spread, spinach to make a wrap
- I had my first cheat meal and kept the day under 2000 calories. This was a big win for me because I tend to toss my diet out the window when I go to social events.
- allowing myself to have a glass of wine when we go out for dinner
- swapped coffee for unsweetened iced tea

What to change this next week:
- fix sleep schedule (12 pm bedtime -> 10 pm)
- start studying earlier in the morning (10-12 pm -> 9 am)
- stop micromanaging fiancé 
- read the labels on food. I accidentally bought gatorade with sugar instead of Gatorade zero.

Other thoughts:
This week is going to be the most challenging because I agreed to do drop in pet sitting two days then am leaving town Friday for the weekend. I just need to get slightly ahead on my work to maintain the recommended bar study schedule. I’ll probably need to pack my lunches for the run-around pet sitting days.

Our hot water heater, range, and furnace are all natural gas, and I'm okay being without the dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker, microwave, air fryer, etc while the power is down.

From what I've read, finding a generator with a low THD will be important in my scenario due to the sensitive nature of inverter AC/heat pumps, an inverter generator is a must. Others have said a non-inverter generator with advertised low-THD  such as the Westinghouse WGen11500TFc would suffice. I won't have the ability to measure that once I'm up and running, so I'll be entirely going by the advice of others. It's probably going to be used max 1-2 days per year, so efficiency isn't that big of a deal, I just don't want to nuke the $16k heat pump that we had installed last year.

Please be kind, I have been hurting a lot because of far too many horrendous stuff going on. After my husband died 25 years ago, my life has been caring for my daughter and working. I have remained completely alone, never even thought about anyone coming into my life. A year ago, someone I have known for several years, got closer, we joked a lot, a bit if banter, and I started seeing his face in my mind, hearing his voice,dreaming about him and a very strong need to speak and see him. It hurt constantly. I never had this before, and suddenly it looked like another person was there, one that would not speak with me. I tried to speak with him, to ask if something happened and if he was ok, but reactions were strange, I just had his contacts from work, but he did not want to give his number and refused any attempt to have a coffee or conversation. I was thinking that I had gone mad, and was furious with myself because the hurt continued to grow. I have tried all I could to cut this and move on. Until I had a reading from someone that coincides with one I did for myself. And it was not a fantasy I created or something that I have misinterpreted. But the reading say that he is 'removed, battling his demons' and that someone else will be coming into my life. still don't understand what or why, but I still feel so attached, would a spell, like a love jar or any other spell, should be done to get him to talk to me and come to me, or should I listen to the reading, cope with this pain I cannot even understand and let it go?

What do I do?,"Kind of a long read, I apologize, but any and all advice is welcome. I feel as though to truly understand I need to lay it all out. 

So my husband(32) and I(32)have been married for 3.5 years. Together for 9. As soon as we got married we started trying for a baby. We had two miscarriages: December 2022 and August 2023. It took me a while in between each one to even be comfortable having sex and it took a while to even get pregnant. I was in a dark place, as my entire life I’ve only ever wanted to be a Mother. I was so scared of losing another baby. 

It was a long and hard couple years for me. Then my husband got a work promotion across the country. So I quit my job as a teacher of 5 years, we left our families behind, and on we went in January of 2024. We were scared and unsure of what was to come, but it was amazing. We had loads of friends. Our relationship seemed to be in an incredible place.  Though I struggled to find a job, I didn’t want to teach in a large city so I pursued other jobs. They weren’t out of my realm of knowledge, and though I got close in a couple of interviews I never ended up landing one. Then I learned in the middle of June 2024 that I was pregnant again. I planned to tell my husband on his birthday, at the end of June. My husband seemed delighted, told me not to worry about finding a job since he got such a good promotion and promised me I would be a SAHM. I think this news really motivated him at work, he started upping his sales which he gets commission on. He even won two awards for his company for really turning around the Market, increasing their by sales $1mil. 

In between me finding out I was pregnant and telling him about our pregnancy, he had a work trip. At this work trip he had a confrontation with a female coworker who he was apparently flirting with via Instagram. Nothing sexual, but consistent messages and definitely building towards something. She confronted him in front of a group of coworkers about how he’s married. Well, the next day he gets a text message from another female coworker. Who he messages back and asks her why she’s talking to him if she knows he’s married. As you probably guessed, they continued texting. It was probably a week or two later that I told him we were pregnant. 

His relationship with this woman continues, but now with phone calls, sexting, etc. Meanwhile I think everything is great. He pushes back meetings to go to our doctor’s appointments. Our new friends through us a baby shower. But there was something a little off as sometimes he would get in these moods where he seemed sad. He’s not super confrontational and doesn’t express emotions very well. I would continuously ask what was wrong and he would always assure me he was fine. I assumed he was just nervous to become a Dad. 

Well, then his work gives us the opportunity to move back home where our families are (back across the country) and ultimately because we were pregnant we decided to go back. So, January 2025 we move back across the country. A couple weeks later he goes on a work trip with a male superior. Well, his mistress joins him. He books an Airbnb with a credit card I don’t have access to, but that we pay off with our bank account, and finally gets his pleasure from her. The work trip was about 5 days long, and in two cities. So she follows him to the second city where he books the nicest hotel with our money again for the two of them. All the while he’s messaging me, his 36 week pregnant wife, telling me how he’s misses me, loves me, telling me how amazing of a mother I will be, and how he can’t wait to be home. 

At the end of February 2025 out pops our miracle baby boy who it the most perfect baby you’ve ever seen. A cute newborn, big, no issues, zero jaundice, and a great sleeper from day one (still is!). In the hospital he starts balling his eyes out and I’m thinking he’s just so happy. Looking back I think the guilt hit him in that moment. He also (real) came down with the flu. Hit him like a train. At the time we were living with my Mom, and my sister lives literally right next door. So with a baby coming home we quarantine him to my sister’s house. My sister helps me the next two nights in the hospital. Bathing me, helping me dress myself, you know…all the things. Five days later my husband has been fever and symptom free for 48 hours and he finally gets to hold his baby boy. 

Another week goes by and he goes to Las Vegas. He tells me his CEO personally requested him to join. Not sure if that’s true or not, but it was an actual work conference and his CEO was there. So I think it’s an exciting and a great opportunity for him. Sure, I’m 2 weeks postpartum, but he’s the sole provider for us. You guessed it, his mistress joins him again. Another two weeks go by and he tells me everything. Balling his eyes out. He said he can’t hold the guilt in any longer. He sees me and our boy and can’t stand that he has this secret. He’s cut off contact with her, etc.

We have some long and honest conversations, ones that obviously needed to happen before this all started. To add to the matter, he found out he contracted genital herpes from her. Talk about instant karma. 

So as you can imagine I feel completely destroyed inside. I take some time to process and while I do I’m basically begging him to stay with me and that we can fix it and manage the herpes. I feel the complete opposite now that I’ve had time to process everything and I’m not in the newborn trenches anymore. Because again, when he told me all of this our baby was only 4 weeks old. My stitches hadn’t healed, I still couldn’t sit down comfortably, my nipples were bleeding, our feeding journey resulted in formula-feeding so the mom guilt was real, I wasn’t sleeping (though baby was a good sleeper it was hard to catch z’s with all of this going on), etc. 

Somewhere in between him telling me and now his mistress contacts me on Facebook. Just telling me how sorry she is and how she didn’t know he was married (which now I know she did know he was married). I don’t respond because I’m a grown woman and think before I act. Three weeks later she messages me again telling me she hopes I’m getting therapy and asking how I can be ok and stay with a man who has done all of this. I just popped a baby out of my body…as if my world wasn’t already changing. I just wanted time to be with my perfect baby. To enjoy my creation, so I ignored everything for a while and decided I need to just be in the bliss of what I’ve always wanted - motherhood. So I didn’t respond. 

She doesn’t know me. She doesn’t even really know my husband. She doesn’t know that my husband transformed me from an innocent and insecure girl to a confident woman. That he was the one and only person I’d ever given myself to. He was a broke kid when we first met who couldn’t even afford McDonald’s and now he’s making six figures a year because of my love and support. I was at every basketball game and most practices when he coached, always at his side cheering him on. He came from a broken home where his parents divorced and then left him and his brothers with the grandparents. He had never really seen or been given real love before. I gave that to him or I guess I thought I did? Before he took the job he has now he was laid-off from coaching and teaching due to COVID. He wasn’t going to take this new job but I pushed him to just see what happens because I saw that it was a perfect opportunity for him. 

So, anyways, now my 4 month old and I sit here. Unsure what to do. Obviously I’m not going to stay with him. I have zero income. We have two cars that will be fully paid off in 3 months. We just bought a house and he keeps telling me that our son will grow up in this house, he’ll always be here for me and our son. He also says that he will continue to allow me to be a SAHM. Is that even possible? I feel like he’s not being realistic at all and I told him that if we get divorced I don’t feel like these things he is saying are true. But then he talks about not getting divorced and just separating? I guess so financially he can support our son and me. 

He is pursuing his mistress. They both have so many red flags you’d think they were sponsored by warning labels. But maybe that makes them perfect for each other? I doubt it. She is 7 years younger than us, which is wild to me. She got her drivers license when he and I met not even a year after college. Crazy thought. He is incredibly remorseful about the situation. He says he will always love me and we will always ‘be together’. I think of myself as an amazing woman who, despite what he’s done, has decided to try and give grace and not strip him of everything. I know he will be a good father. I also see us having a good relationship and maybe even friends in the future, once I recover mentally from all of this. However, one thing I will not budge on is that I don’t want my son having any contact with his mistress. Ever. I don’t even want her to ever lay eyes on him. She’s blocked me on all social media (including my family who has no idea what’s going on), so obviously she wants nothing to do with me or my son. 

Once my family finds out I’m sure their initial reaction will be shock and then an urge to beat his face into the ground. Again, I want to have a good relationship with him moving forward so I think I’ll advise them to just not say anything to him? Kind of like a silence speaks louder than actual words type of approach. My Mom can be a very harsh and intimidating person. I lost my father in 2019, but have a great stepdad. I’m also very close to his family, but if they take his side on this I’m not sure I’ll be able to handle that mentally. He was raised with his cousins, one of whom had this happen to him after his first year of marriage though no kids were involved. I just wouldn’t think he would talk to my husband at all after everyone finds out. But he and his family are incredibly close and his uncle is obsessed with our baby and sees him as his own grandchild. 

I know I can eventually independently provide for my son, but having some time to figure it all out would be nice. I also have incredible support from my own family. My sister is the only one who knows everything and has already offered her guest bedroom to us. 

Recently my husband found out his dad has cancer, so he spent the last 2ish weeks with him 9 hours away. While he was there he saw his mistress twice and the ‘had coffee and talked’. Before going up there he promised he was not talking to her/she was blocked. He said he was going to see his dad and figure out what makes him happy and bring him joy. He got back in town two days ago has been staying with his therapist, who is also his childhood’s best friend’s mom. She knows the entire situation. 

What do I do? I feel embarrassed and stupid, sad, angry, and so incredibly alone right now. I want my son’s father to be in his daily life because every boy needs his Dad, but I will not tolerate any contact with his mistress. So now that it’s all out there, does anyone have any advice on how I should move forward? How/when should I tell my family? Should I just stay separated for the financial benefits? Or should I just cute it all off? Is it even possible to make it so his mistress has zero contact with my son?

1lhw2o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lhw2o8/my_psychiatrist_said_the_man_i_see_behind_me_is_a/,My psychiatrist said the man I see behind me is a hallucination. She was wrong.,"I haven’t looked at my own reflection properly in weeks. Not in a mirror, not in a shop window, not even in the dark screen of my phone before it lights up. Because when I do, he’s there. Standing right behind me. Watching.

It started about a month ago, after the incident at the beach. I used to be a lifeguard. It wasn’t a career, just a summer job to pay the bills. Most days were boring – kids running, people forgetting sunscreen, the occasional jellyfish sting. Routine stuff. But that day… that day was different.

There was an old man. He seemed confused, disoriented. He kept wandering towards the water, fully clothed. I’d gently guide him back towards his family, who seemed exasperated, explaining he had dementia. This happened a few times. I got busy with a kid who’d scraped his knee. Took my eye off the old man for maybe ten minutes, max. That’s all it took.

When I looked up again, he was out there. Way out. Beyond the breakers, where the water gets deep and treacherous. He wasn't swimming. He was flailing, his head bobbing under the waves, panic etched on his face.

I blew my whistle, grabbed my float, and sprinted into the surf. The water was cold, the current strong. I swam as hard as I could, my arms burning, my lungs screaming. But I was too late. By the time I reached the spot where I’d last seen him, he was gone. Just the empty, indifferent gray water. We searched for hours. His body washed up a mile down the coast the next morning.

The guilt was… immense. Crushing. It was my job to watch, to protect. And I’d failed. I hadn’t noticed him in time. If I’d just been more vigilant…

A few days after the funeral, it started. I was brushing my teeth, staring blankly into the bathroom mirror. And there he was. Not in the mirror, exactly, but behind my reflection. The old man. His skin was bloated and pale, the color of wet parchment. His eyes were hollow, dark pits. His clothes were soaked, clinging to his thin frame. And he was just… looking at me. Not accusingly, not angrily. Just… looking. Like he was waiting for something.

I splashed water on my face, thinking I was overtired, stressed. But when I looked again, he was still there. Clearer, almost.

It wasn't just the bathroom mirror. It was any reflective surface. A puddle on the sidewalk after it rained. The shiny chrome of a car bumper. The dark surface of my morning coffee before I stirred in the milk. Every time I caught my own reflection, there he was, a silent, bloated passenger standing just over my shoulder. Always the same expressionless, hollow-eyed stare. Always looking right at me.

I tried to ignore it. To tell myself it was just stress, a vivid manifestation of my guilt. But he was so real. The way the waterlogged fabric of his shirt seemed to sag, the faint, almost imperceptible blue tinge to his lips. Details my mind shouldn't have been able to conjure so vividly.

Sleep became a battlefield. I’d close my eyes and see him, floating in the darkness behind my eyelids. I’d wake up in a cold sweat, convinced he was standing in the corner of my room, just out of sight. My appetite vanished. I lost weight. The world started to feel thin, unreal, like a poorly projected image.

Eventually, I broke down and went to a psychiatrist. I felt like a fool trying to explain it. “I keep seeing… the man who drowned. In reflections.”

The psychiatrist, a kind woman with tired eyes, listened patiently. She nodded a lot. She called it a ""grief-induced hallucinatory manifestation."" A fancy way of saying my guilt was making me see things. She prescribed some mild anti-anxiety medication and gave me some advice.

""The most important thing,"" she said, her voice calm and reassuring, ""is to try and break the association. Avoid looking at reflective surfaces for a while. Consciously turn away. When the guilt starts to fade, when you begin to process the trauma, these… visions… they will lessen. They’ll go away.""

It sounded too simple. But I was desperate. So, I tried. I really tried. I covered the mirror in my bathroom with a towel. I avoided shop windows. I learned to shave by feel. I stopped drinking coffee from dark mugs. It was difficult, living in a world where I had to constantly avert my gaze from my own image, but I was determined to make him go away.

For a week, it almost seemed to work. I wasn’t seeing him, because I wasn’t looking. The meds took the edge off my anxiety. I started to sleep a little better. I thought, maybe she’s right. Maybe this is just my mind playing tricks on me.

And then things got so much worse.

It was evening. I was walking home from the grocery store. The sun was setting, casting long, distorted shadows on the pavement. I glanced down at my own shadow stretching out in front of me.

And he was there.

Not a reflection, but a shadow superimposed over mine, standing just behind it. And this time, there was something new. He seemed… closer. Not physically closer in the shadow, but the feeling of him was more intense, more present. Like he’d taken a step towards me in whatever spectral space he occupied.

My blood ran cold. This wasn't just water reflections anymore.

Over the next few days, it escalated. I’d see him in the faint reflection on my TV screen when it was off. In the polished surface of a tabletop. In the glint of my own glasses if I caught them at the wrong angle. And every single time, he was a little bit closer. His shadowy form in my shadow was no longer just behind me; it was almost merging with mine. The feeling of his presence was becoming oppressive, a constant weight on my chest.

The psychiatrist’s advice had backfired spectacularly. Avoiding reflections hadn't made him go away. It had made him… adapt. Spread. Like a stain.

I stopped taking the medication. It wasn’t helping. This wasn’t a hallucination I could medicate away. This was something else. Something real.

And I realized something. Something I hadn’t told the psychiatrist. Something I hadn't told anyone.

The old man. When he was drowning. I hadn’t been too late.

That’s the lie I told myself, the lie I told everyone. The truth is, I reached him. I saw the panic in his eyes, felt his frail, desperate hands clawing at me as he fought for air. I had him. I could have pulled him in. I could have saved him.

But I didn’t.

You see, being a lifeguard… it presents opportunities. People are vulnerable in the water. Unsuspecting. And I have… a hobby. A very particular kind of hobby. It started a few years ago. A need. A curiosity. To see what it felt like. To watch the light go out of someone’s eyes, knowing I was the cause. My first was a drunk who’d passed out too close to the tide line late one night. Easy. Messy, but easy.

After that, the guilt was… different. Not like this. It was a sharp, almost exhilarating thing. A secret power. And it faded quickly, especially after the next one. Each new experience, each new type of ending I orchestrated, seemed to cleanse the palate, so to speak. The thrill of the new, the challenge, it pushed the old memories down.

The old man, with his dementia, his helplessness… he was a new type. So vulnerable. So trusting, even in his confusion. It was supposed to be… interesting. A new texture for my collection. I held him under, just for a moment longer than necessary. Watched the last bubbles escape his lips. Then I let go and played the part of the grieving, failed lifeguard.

This spectral presence, this constant, watery accuser… this had never happened before. With the others, there was nothing. Just the quiet satisfaction of a completed project. But him… he was clinging to me. Or I was clinging to him.

I decided the psychiatrist was wrong, but maybe the underlying principle was right. I needed to break the association. But not by avoidance. By repetition. By overlaying this bad memory with a new one. A fresh experience. That’s what had worked before. That’s how I’d managed the… lingering thoughts after the first time. I needed to get back on the horse, so to speak.

So, I went back to the beach. Not the same one. A different one, a few towns over. I got my old lifeguard certification renewed, no questions asked. I needed to be in that environment. I needed the opportunity.

For a week, I sat in the chair, scanning the waves, my skin crawling. Every ripple on the water, every glint of sun, showed him to me. Still there. Still watching. Closer now. His face almost touching my reflection’s shoulder. His hollow eyes staring directly into mine. But I forced myself to look. To endure it. I was waiting.

Then, I saw her. A young woman, swimming alone, far out from the shore, away from the crowds. She was a strong swimmer, but she was isolated. Vulnerable. Perfect.

This was it. This would fix it. A new memory to overwrite the old.

I stood up, grabbed my float, my heart pounding with a familiar, dark excitement that almost drowned out the dread. I jogged towards the water’s edge. This time, I wouldn’t be too late. This time, I’d be perfectly on time.

The first wave washed over my ankles. Cold. And then it happened.

It wasn't a cramp. It wasn't a stumble. It was hands.

Icy, impossibly strong hands, erupting from the sand beneath the shallow water, clamping around my ankles like manacles. They were bone-chillingly cold, and their grip was like iron. I cried out, a strangled yelp, and looked down.

There was nothing there. Just the water swirling around my legs. But the grip was real. It was pulling me down, pulling me towards the deeper water.

Panic, raw and absolute, a kind I’d never experienced before, exploded in my chest. This wasn’t part of the plan. I thrashed, kicking, trying to break free, but the hands held firm, their grip tightening, dragging me deeper. The water was up to my knees, then my waist. I could feel the sandy bottom dropping away beneath my feet.

I screamed, a real scream this time, not the performance I’d perfected. I clawed at the water, at the air, fighting against the invisible force that was trying to drown me. For a terrifying moment, I thought this was it. This was how it ended. The hunter becoming the hunted.

With a final, desperate surge of adrenaline, I threw myself backwards, towards the shore, towards the solid ground. The hands resisted for a moment, then, with a reluctance that felt almost like a sigh, they released me.

I scrambled back onto the wet sand, gasping, coughing, my body trembling uncontrollably. I lay there for a moment, the sun beating down on me, the sounds of the happy, oblivious beachgoers a million miles away.

Then, slowly, I pushed myself up and looked at the water.

He was there.

Standing in the shallow surf, as clear as daylight. Not a reflection. Not a shadow. Him. The old man. Bloated, waterlogged, his clothes clinging to him. His hollow eyes were fixed on me.

But this time, there was something new. Something that sent a sliver of ice straight through my soul.

He was smiling.

A wide, slow, knowing smile. A smile that said, I see you. I know what you are. And you’re not getting away.

It wasn’t guilt. It wasn’t a hallucination. It was him. He was real. And he wasn’t just watching anymore. He was interacting. He was protecting others from me.

I didn’t wait. I didn’t think. I just ran. I ran from the beach, from the water, from that smiling, dead man. I ran until I reached my car, and I drove until I reached my apartment.

I’m here now. The towel is off the mirror. I can’t avoid it anymore. He’s there, standing behind me. Closer than ever. His smile is gone, replaced by that same, patient, hollow-eyed stare. But now I understand it. It’s not blame. It’s a promise.

What do I do? How do I get rid of him? I can’t go back to the beach, I can’t go near the ocean. But what if that’s not enough? What if, like before, he adapts? What if he starts appearing not just in reflections, but in the room with me? What if those hands aren't confined to the water?

I thought I was the predator. I thought I was in control. But I was wrong. I’m haunted. I’m [marked](https://www.reddit.com/user/gamalfrank/).

I debated on it because the price is hefty, but it also includes all your sodas, energy drinks, speciality coffee, milkshakes, smoothies, etc… (nothing counts to your 15 a day limit aside from alcohol) … so I took the plunge! 

I will say I do believe the liquor content isn’t as potent… I bartended for years and not once did I see them open a new bottle of liquor at the bar, but into a room to get one. Just my hot take, I’d say it’s diluted a bit, but still worth it. I got champagne a good bit the last couple days and you can’t dilute champagne without jeopardizing the bubbles so that was giving for sure. 

Ultimately, my husband and I only met our 15 limit one day out of 5 days, but when we added it up at the end, we spent roughly $1800 on drinks, vs our $740 drink package!

It started about a month ago, after the incident at the beach. I used to be a lifeguard. It wasn’t a career, just a summer job to pay the bills. Most days were boring – kids running, people forgetting sunscreen, the occasional jellyfish sting. Routine stuff. But that day… that day was different.

There was an old man. He seemed confused, disoriented. He kept wandering towards the water, fully clothed. I’d gently guide him back towards his family, who seemed exasperated, explaining he had dementia. This happened a few times. I got busy with a kid who’d scraped his knee. Took my eye off the old man for maybe ten minutes, max. That’s all it took.

When I looked up again, he was out there. Way out. Beyond the breakers, where the water gets deep and treacherous. He wasn't swimming. He was flailing, his head bobbing under the waves, panic etched on his face.

I blew my whistle, grabbed my float, and sprinted into the surf. The water was cold, the current strong. I swam as hard as I could, my arms burning, my lungs screaming. But I was too late. By the time I reached the spot where I’d last seen him, he was gone. Just the empty, indifferent gray water. We searched for hours. His body washed up a mile down the coast the next morning.

The guilt was… immense. Crushing. It was my job to watch, to protect. And I’d failed. I hadn’t noticed him in time. If I’d just been more vigilant…

A few days after the funeral, it started. I was brushing my teeth, staring blankly into the bathroom mirror. And there he was. Not in the mirror, exactly, but behind my reflection. The old man. His skin was bloated and pale, the color of wet parchment. His eyes were hollow, dark pits. His clothes were soaked, clinging to his thin frame. And he was just… looking at me. Not accusingly, not angrily. Just… looking. Like he was waiting for something.

I splashed water on my face, thinking I was overtired, stressed. But when I looked again, he was still there. Clearer, almost.

It wasn't just the bathroom mirror. It was any reflective surface. A puddle on the sidewalk after it rained. The shiny chrome of a car bumper. The dark surface of my morning coffee before I stirred in the milk. Every time I caught my own reflection, there he was, a silent, bloated passenger standing just over my shoulder. Always the same expressionless, hollow-eyed stare. Always looking right at me.

I tried to ignore it. To tell myself it was just stress, a vivid manifestation of my guilt. But he was so real. The way the waterlogged fabric of his shirt seemed to sag, the faint, almost imperceptible blue tinge to his lips. Details my mind shouldn't have been able to conjure so vividly.

Sleep became a battlefield. I’d close my eyes and see him, floating in the darkness behind my eyelids. I’d wake up in a cold sweat, convinced he was standing in the corner of my room, just out of sight. My appetite vanished. I lost weight. The world started to feel thin, unreal, like a poorly projected image.

Eventually, I broke down and went to a psychiatrist. I felt like a fool trying to explain it. “I keep seeing… the man who drowned. In reflections.”

The psychiatrist, a kind woman with tired eyes, listened patiently. She nodded a lot. She called it a ""grief-induced hallucinatory manifestation."" A fancy way of saying my guilt was making me see things. She prescribed some mild anti-anxiety medication and gave me some advice.

""The most important thing,"" she said, her voice calm and reassuring, ""is to try and break the association. Avoid looking at reflective surfaces for a while. Consciously turn away. When the guilt starts to fade, when you begin to process the trauma, these… visions… they will lessen. They’ll go away.""

It sounded too simple. But I was desperate. So, I tried. I really tried. I covered the mirror in my bathroom with a towel. I avoided shop windows. I learned to shave by feel. I stopped drinking coffee from dark mugs. It was difficult, living in a world where I had to constantly avert my gaze from my own image, but I was determined to make him go away.

For a week, it almost seemed to work. I wasn’t seeing him, because I wasn’t looking. The meds took the edge off my anxiety. I started to sleep a little better. I thought, maybe she’s right. Maybe this is just my mind playing tricks on me.

And then things got so much worse.

It was evening. I was walking home from the grocery store. The sun was setting, casting long, distorted shadows on the pavement. I glanced down at my own shadow stretching out in front of me.

And he was there.

Not a reflection, but a shadow superimposed over mine, standing just behind it. And this time, there was something new. He seemed… closer. Not physically closer in the shadow, but the feeling of him was more intense, more present. Like he’d taken a step towards me in whatever spectral space he occupied.

My blood ran cold. This wasn't just water reflections anymore.

Over the next few days, it escalated. I’d see him in the faint reflection on my TV screen when it was off. In the polished surface of a tabletop. In the glint of my own glasses if I caught them at the wrong angle. And every single time, he was a little bit closer. His shadowy form in my shadow was no longer just behind me; it was almost merging with mine. The feeling of his presence was becoming oppressive, a constant weight on my chest.

The psychiatrist’s advice had backfired spectacularly. Avoiding reflections hadn't made him go away. It had made him… adapt. Spread. Like a stain.

I stopped taking the medication. It wasn’t helping. This wasn’t a hallucination I could medicate away. This was something else. Something real.

And I realized something. Something I hadn’t told the psychiatrist. Something I hadn't told anyone.

The old man. When he was drowning. I hadn’t been too late.

That’s the lie I told myself, the lie I told everyone. The truth is, I reached him. I saw the panic in his eyes, felt his frail, desperate hands clawing at me as he fought for air. I had him. I could have pulled him in. I could have saved him.

But I didn’t.

You see, being a lifeguard… it presents opportunities. People are vulnerable in the water. Unsuspecting. And I have… a hobby. A very particular kind of hobby. It started a few years ago. A need. A curiosity. To see what it felt like. To watch the light go out of someone’s eyes, knowing I was the cause. My first was a drunk who’d passed out too close to the tide line late one night. Easy. Messy, but easy.

After that, the guilt was… different. Not like this. It was a sharp, almost exhilarating thing. A secret power. And it faded quickly, especially after the next one. Each new experience, each new type of ending I orchestrated, seemed to cleanse the palate, so to speak. The thrill of the new, the challenge, it pushed the old memories down.

The old man, with his dementia, his helplessness… he was a new type. So vulnerable. So trusting, even in his confusion. It was supposed to be… interesting. A new texture for my collection. I held him under, just for a moment longer than necessary. Watched the last bubbles escape his lips. Then I let go and played the part of the grieving, failed lifeguard.

This spectral presence, this constant, watery accuser… this had never happened before. With the others, there was nothing. Just the quiet satisfaction of a completed project. But him… he was clinging to me. Or I was clinging to him.

I decided the psychiatrist was wrong, but maybe the underlying principle was right. I needed to break the association. But not by avoidance. By repetition. By overlaying this bad memory with a new one. A fresh experience. That’s what had worked before. That’s how I’d managed the… lingering thoughts after the first time. I needed to get back on the horse, so to speak.

So, I went back to the beach. Not the same one. A different one, a few towns over. I got my old lifeguard certification renewed, no questions asked. I needed to be in that environment. I needed the opportunity.

For a week, I sat in the chair, scanning the waves, my skin crawling. Every ripple on the water, every glint of sun, showed him to me. Still there. Still watching. Closer now. His face almost touching my reflection’s shoulder. His hollow eyes staring directly into mine. But I forced myself to look. To endure it. I was waiting.

Then, I saw her. A young woman, swimming alone, far out from the shore, away from the crowds. She was a strong swimmer, but she was isolated. Vulnerable. Perfect.

This was it. This would fix it. A new memory to overwrite the old.

I stood up, grabbed my float, my heart pounding with a familiar, dark excitement that almost drowned out the dread. I jogged towards the water’s edge. This time, I wouldn’t be too late. This time, I’d be perfectly on time.

The first wave washed over my ankles. Cold. And then it happened.

It wasn't a cramp. It wasn't a stumble. It was hands.

Icy, impossibly strong hands, erupting from the sand beneath the shallow water, clamping around my ankles like manacles. They were bone-chillingly cold, and their grip was like iron. I cried out, a strangled yelp, and looked down.

There was nothing there. Just the water swirling around my legs. But the grip was real. It was pulling me down, pulling me towards the deeper water.

Panic, raw and absolute, a kind I’d never experienced before, exploded in my chest. This wasn’t part of the plan. I thrashed, kicking, trying to break free, but the hands held firm, their grip tightening, dragging me deeper. The water was up to my knees, then my waist. I could feel the sandy bottom dropping away beneath my feet.

I screamed, a real scream this time, not the performance I’d perfected. I clawed at the water, at the air, fighting against the invisible force that was trying to drown me. For a terrifying moment, I thought this was it. This was how it ended. The hunter becoming the hunted.

With a final, desperate surge of adrenaline, I threw myself backwards, towards the shore, towards the solid ground. The hands resisted for a moment, then, with a reluctance that felt almost like a sigh, they released me.

I scrambled back onto the wet sand, gasping, coughing, my body trembling uncontrollably. I lay there for a moment, the sun beating down on me, the sounds of the happy, oblivious beachgoers a million miles away.

Then, slowly, I pushed myself up and looked at the water.

He was there.

Standing in the shallow surf, as clear as daylight. Not a reflection. Not a shadow. Him. The old man. Bloated, waterlogged, his clothes clinging to him. His hollow eyes were fixed on me.

But this time, there was something new. Something that sent a sliver of ice straight through my soul.

He was smiling.

A wide, slow, knowing smile. A smile that said, I see you. I know what you are. And you’re not getting away.

It wasn’t guilt. It wasn’t a hallucination. It was him. He was real. And he wasn’t just watching anymore. He was interacting. He was protecting others from me.

I didn’t wait. I didn’t think. I just ran. I ran from the beach, from the water, from that smiling, dead man. I ran until I reached my car, and I drove until I reached my apartment.

I’m here now. The towel is off the mirror. I can’t avoid it anymore. He’s there, standing behind me. Closer than ever. His smile is gone, replaced by that same, patient, hollow-eyed stare. But now I understand it. It’s not blame. It’s a promise.

What do I do? How do I get rid of him? I can’t go back to the beach, I can’t go near the ocean. But what if that’s not enough? What if, like before, he adapts? What if he starts appearing not just in reflections, but in the room with me? What if those hands aren't confined to the water?

I thought I was the predator. I thought I was in control. But I was wrong. I’m haunted. I’m [marked](https://www.reddit.com/user/gamalfrank/).

Ever felt like you’re running on a treadmill set to high speed, but you’re not actually going anywhere? 🙋‍♂️ You’re not alone! So many of us get caught up in the grind, pushing through burnout and neglecting what truly matters. But guess what? Retirement doesn’t have to be a big scary abyss of time where we can lose ourselves. It can be a time of balance and purpose—*if* we learn to craft it that way.  

**Let’s dive into how we can shift gears from burnout to balance.**  
Here are a few game changers that have totally reshaped my perspective on retirement:  

- **Discover Your 'Why':** Why do you want to retire? Is it for more time with family, pursuing hobbies, or just to kick back and enjoy life? Knowing your purpose gives you direction. It’s like having a GPS for your journey.  
- **Design Your Daily Routine:** Flip the script! Instead of the 9-to-5 grind, create a daily rhythm that aligns with your values. How about morning walks, afternoon books, and evenings of Netflix? 🍿  
- **Prioritize Self-Care:** Seriously, how many of us have neglected ourselves in the hustle? Make *self-care* a non-negotiable. Whether it’s yoga, reading, or just enjoying a quiet cup of coffee—but make it happen!  
- **Connect With Communities:** Building relationships is key. Surround yourself with like-minded folks who inspire you. There’s magic in connection!  
- **Stay Curious:** Keep learning and growing. Ever thought about taking a cooking class? Or exploring new hobbies? This journey doesn’t stop at retirement; it evolves!  

And here’s a little secret: Life shouldn’t be about “more work” or “more stress.” It should be about empowerment. If you’re considering ways to live life on your terms as you age, check out how this app *empowers people to choose how they live as they age.* It’s pretty neat! ❤️   
[Check it out here!](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb) (Just a heads up: I earn a small commission if you decide to check it out!)  

So, have you thought about what a purpose-driven retirement looks like for you? Who knows, maybe it’s time to start crafting that life you’ve always dreamed of! Let’s embrace this journey together, and maybe share a laugh or two along the way? What’s one thing that sparks joy for you in retirement? 🎉",1,1750619590.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

I (23 f) work at a coffee shop and an ex coworker lets call him Noah (21 m) has become a regular. We were friendly when we worked together so I always say hi when he comes in. Today was no different I handed him his drink and chatted for a few minutes. My coworker Jane jokingly told us to stop flirting. I laughed and went back to work. Then Jane mentioned that Noah once told her that he had a really big crush on me, but Jane told him she didn’t think I was into younger guys. I was floored yes I’m not into usually into guys younger than me but I did have a small crush on Noah, he’s very handsome and sweet and over all a good person. I never acted on it because when I met him he had a girlfriend. Jane then told me that they had broken up for a while but are now back together. 

I feel like I’m going to scream and cry, not because of him in particular, but because I feel like it’s the universe telling me that love isn’t in the stars for me . Twice I’ve had a crush and we would talk everyday a be really touchy and then suddenly they would date my ex best friend. (That’s it’s own thing) I’ve had some who seemed like my dream guy and turn out to have a girlfriend.  And I’m not gonna get into the girl that was 100% flirting with me while she was in a relationship. 

I feel like these people keep being put in my orbit and I just end up feeling disappointed and unlovable. Like what is so wrong with me? Why is it never me. It seems to come so easy to everyone around me. And it’s so hard cause I’ve learned to appreciate single live. I have hobbies, family and friends that fulfill me more that a relationship. I love myself, I think I’m beautiful and funny but I wish someone else thought that about me too. I just feel like I’m so behind on this milestone that everyone else has already hit, hell, even my younger sister has had her first relationship and break up. I know that everything happens in its own time but the wait is so lonely.

One of the joys of using an Aeropress is EJECTING the puck into your receptacle of choice (for me, compost). I get a ridiculous kick out of it. The disk makes this a trickier proposition. I can EJECT the puck regardless and just fish out the disk, though that takes some of the joy out of it. I can peel off the disk and EJECT what’s left, though that is even more joyless. 

It’s not *actually* a big deal… the pros of the disk outweigh this one issue, and by the time I’m sipping my coffee, I’m pleased with my choices. But once in a while, if I have any trouble at all finding the disk - like, if it takes me more than 5 seconds - I’ll be all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ and just grab paper filters so I can have my fun.

I’m 39f and I have been participating in hook up culture for the last few years.

Anytime I have a one night stand, the guy wants to have sex again. But the last four or five guys I have slept with, I wasn’t really incentivized to have sex with them again. I wasn’t thoroughly against it, but I just wasn’t very driven to pursue another hook up.

They text me and bug me, some even after a year of no contact. So why aren’t they inviting me out to dinner to entice me out? They know I’ll have sex with them. I already did once. So why aren’t they taking me out on a date? 

I actually convinced one guy to get into a loose sugar baby situation by explaining this to him. So I get money instead of a date.

Maybe it’s that they just can’t fake interest anymore? That they really don’t like women and care about sharing our company for a couple hours before we have sex? Maybe they don’t feel interesting and like they can carry a conversation with a acquaintance for a couple of hours. Maybe they’re scared that by going out on dates it’ll turn into more than a casual hook up.

I don’t know, but I could talk about this ad nauseam. I’m not a prude and I’m generally willing to have sex on the first date, I enjoy sex, but it’s not fun for me to only have sex. I also enjoy cuddling, napping, talking, playing, foosball, etc..",0,1750619235.0,TwoXChromosomes,29,0.36,False

A few days ago, I shared a detailed post about Coursera Plus's massive summer sale discounts.

Just a quick update — this offer is only valid for a few more days, and after that, the discounts will be reduced significantly or return to the original cost.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the current Coursera Plus deals by region:

* [Global – 50% Off](https://imp.i384100.net/c/3542565/3057183/14726) → Pay $199 for 1 year
* [APAC, EMEA, LATAM ](https://imp.i384100.net/YR0KZR)– 65% Off → Pay $139 for 1 year
* 🇮🇳 [India only – 75% Off](https://imp.i384100.net/c/3542565/3057242/14726) → Pay INR 7,999/year
* 🇬🇧 [UK only – 55% Off](https://imp.i384100.net/c/3542565/3057191/14726) → Pay £172 for 1 year
* 🇩🇪 [Germany only – 50% Off](https://imp.i384100.net/c/3542565/3057240/14726) → Pay €190/year

I’ve been using Coursera Plus for over a year now, and trust me — it’s absolutely worth it, especially with these current discounts where you're saving up to $200.

Think about it: for just $199, you get unlimited access to most Professional Certificates and Specializations for a whole year — many of which typically cost **$49/month** individually.

But it’s not just about saving money. Coursera Plus comes with additional perks I’ve personally experienced:

**1. Easily Switch Between Programs**

This is one of the best benefits. If you start a program (say, the Google Cybersecurity Certificate) and find it too basic, you can easily switch to another one (like the IBM Cybersecurity Analyst program) without paying extra — something you can't do when buying a single course.

**2. Wide Variety of Courses**

Coursera covers a wide range of subjects — business, computer science, data science, humanities, engineering, and more. This allows you to explore new interests or grow in your current field.

Whether you're aiming to grow your career, pick up in-demand skills, or just explore something new, Coursera Plus is a smart investment.

These deals are live for a few more days, so if it aligns with your goals, don’t wait too long.

It’s one of the best chances to level up your learning and earn multiple certificates over the next 12 months.

Happy Learning :)

1lhvqgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1lhvqgk/encore_7_day_alaskan_cruise_review/,Encore 7 Day Alaskan Cruise Review,"I figured id do this now as we just got off the ship a few hours ago. Sorry, it’s a little long winded.

We flew in the day before (Saturday) and spent the day in Seattle. We stayed at the Marriot Waterfront, it was a bit pricey but worth it for the convenience as we were literally across the street from the port. We went to the Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens and the Burke Museum which I highly recommend all of them especially the Chihuly Gardens. Dinner at The Wing Dome was great and the we took a walk along the boardwalk which had some great views.

Day 1 - Embarkation 

Our embarkation time was at 11:30, they immediately took our bags and we were actually on the ship by 11:55. Muster station debrief took 2 minutes (basically if shit hits the fan go to the station you are assigned). We decided on an inside stateroom (deck 8) which I do regret. I’ve taken Mexico cruises and I’ve never cared about having a balcony so I assumed this would be the same but the room was almost too small and the views on this cruise are too impeccable to not have the balcony. My husband and I both had the drink package and the Starbucks package. After we tallied up all the drinks we had they were both worth it 100%, we were double fisting all week. 

Day 2 - Sea Day

Very relaxing day, the sea was a bit rough in the morning but mellowed out. I worked out in the mornings, the gym was decent but ALWAYS packed. The ceiling was also really low. We spent all day at the mojito bar which was our group favorite (get the rasberry). Lunch at Local Grill, dinner at the buffet which I was for the most part happy with, lots of variety. 

Day - 3 Juneau (3pm - 10pm)

Weather was PERFECT, sunny and around 60-65 degrees. You can either walk to town (15 minutes with some mild hills) or take the shuttle. We opted for the walk which was beautiful. 

We stopped at the Alaskan Brewing Company on the main boardwalk, order the halibut bites and the blueberry mojito! 

Our next stop was the Alaskan Hotel (oldest operating hotel in Juneau) that had a really cool dive bar feel and wasn’t too busy. I recommend the Tigers Blood Sour by 49th State Brewing.

We ate dinner at Tracey’s King Crab Shack BUT this is a cheat code…there are two. Don’t go to the first one you see off the boat, it’s packed. Walk up the road about 10 minutes and there’s another location (300 Whittier) that has a perfect view of the water and we literally didn’t wait a minute to get seated. The crab was amazing as well as the crab cakes and crab bisque. 

We walked along the boardwalk and finished up at a couple different shops.

Also had a PB&J donut from Jellyfish donuts that I don’t regret at all. 

Day 4 - Skagway (7:30am - 8pm)

Another day of perfect weather (almost). For a majority of the day it was sunny and 65 but around 5pm a random storm came through with some super high winds and rain but only lasted about an hour. Bring a rain jacket, the weather can change at the drop of a hat. 

The walk into town from the port was 15 minutes on flat terrain.

For breakfast we went to Glacial Coffee, they had a huge selection of coffee and breakfast options. The dirty Wilbur and Super bagel were the group favorites. 

Next to Glacial Coffee is Klondike Doughboy. The fried dough was so good, don’t skip this! I shared one with my husband because they are pretty large but only $7!

We stopped into The Klondike Gold Rush National Museum which is free and then walked around the town for a few hours.

We took the White Pass Train excursion (total time 3 hours). I recommend this to everyone. This was probably my favorite part of the entire trip, the views are stunning. I think our tickets were around $120 a piece. 

Dinner was had at Bonanza Bar and Grill. I recommend both the Halibut sandwich and the fish and chips.

Day 5 - Glacier Bay/Sea Day

Go to deck 7 which is the same deck the life boats are on. My husband found the area and we had the spot to ourselves the entire time and had the best views. 

Day 6 - Ketchikan (7:30am to 11am)

Weather was beautiful, sunny and mid 60s.

You HAVE to take the shuttle into town and it’s about a 15 minute drive. Plan accordingly on your return back to port because we waited for 30 minutes for a return shuttle. 

This was a rushed morning because the shuttle requirements really cut in to your time. 

We took the self guided walking tour through Creek street, the Totem Heritage Center and the Salmon Hatchery. From there we stopped at our favorite brewery of the trip, Bawden Brewery. Just an awesome vibe, great customer service and delicious beers on tap. 

Our day was pretty much over at that point because we had to get in line for the shuttle. 

Overall, it was a really pretty town we just wanted more time there. 

Day 7 - Victoria B.C. (8pm to 12am)

It was getting dark by the time we got off the boat but it was around 60 degrees and just slightly windy. 

The downtown area Is about 10-15 minutes away by car. DO NOT use the shuttle service right when you get through the port exit, they charge $15 a person. Walk a little further down and grab you a taxi, our trips to and from port totaled to about $20. 

This was another quick trip but we made the most of it. Whistle Buoy Brewing Company is a must, try a cider or a stout, both were great. Had some poutine at LAuthentique Poutine and Burger and it was delicious. We walked down Wharf St. which was beautiful and stopped at the Parliament building for some photos as it was lit up.

Just like in Ketchikan we made the most of our time but just wish we had more time to explore. 

Debarkation  

We opted to take our own luggage and got off the boat around 7:30am. Outside the port is hectic, a lot of driving services yelling at you asking if you need a ride. We walked further down towards the Marriot and grabbed an uber from there. 

Sorry it’s a little choppy but I’ll be stuck at the airport until 11pm so feel free to ask questions. I have all day. 

Overall, I’d do this cruise again with some slight modifications and perhaps a different schedule of stops.

Izuku Midoriya awoke with a start, at the sound of yelling from outside the Class 1A dorms. Yelling that sounded... suspiciously like his teacher. 
""Oh well, Mineta probably just got caught peeping on the girls again"" Izuku thought to himself, and he laid back down to resume hus sleep.

*""They'll NEVER be heroes!""*

Now, Izuku was *wide* awake. Who was Aizawa sensei talking to? And why did he sound so... *uncharacteristic?* Izuku got out of bed to go investigate for himself. When he got downstairs, he came to find most of his classmates already standing on the porch, watching something. 

*""Deku-kun!""* Uraraka hissed at him. *""Come look, this is super weird!""* Izuku, rather apprehensively, squeezed between Uraraka and Tsuyu to get a glimpse of what was going on. What he saw made him blink in confusion. There, standing squared in the courtyard, quirk activated, was Aizawa sensei. And standing across from him doung the same was... *Aizawa sensei?*

""I swear on my handsome blonde husband, I'll never let you touch these kids!"" said left-Aizawa. 
""They should all be EXPELLED!"" retorted right-Aizawa.

Bakugo walked up next. ""WHAT'S WITH ALL THE DAMN *YELLING""* he yelled.

Izuku recoiled. ""It seems Aizawa sensei is fighting... himself? A clone? His secret twin? Himiko toga doing a really bad impressio-""

""SHUT UP DEKU, NOBODY ASKED YOU"" Bakugo interrupted.

""Bakugo! *Detention!""* said left-Aizawa, looking towards the students for the first time.

""Bakugo. Extra credit. Keep up the good work"" said right-Aizawa, smile extra creepy on his face.

By this point, all of class 1A are gobsmacked. *What... what is happening here?* The Aizawas kept arguing.

""How can you SAY that?!""

""I *know* Problematic Child is the UA traitor, I saw his notebooks.""

""Midoriya is just a boy! A sad, sweet, baby *BOY!""*

""With him gone, I can finally bring in Shinso and form him to be the next me.""

This was getting ridiculous. Someone had to do something. But before Midoriya had the chance to speak up, another voice came from behind the class.

""What is going on out here?""

*THREE Aizawas?!?!*
The newest Aizawa, still in his pj's, looked around the courtyard. He looked at his class. He looked at the two doppelgangers of him arguing. He looked at his half empty cup of coffee.

""Nope"" he finally said. ""I'm going back to bed. Class is dismissed for today."" 

With that he walked off, leaving the bewildered class in his wake. Until Tsuyu broke the silence.

I'm 42, gay, single, and currently living in Hillcrest, San Diego - our local gayborhood, where I’ve been for the past 12 years. I’m a senior interior designer at a small firm here and just got a very tempting job offer with a mid-sized firm in Boca Raton. The salary’s solid, but the benefits package is really what’s making me consider a big move.

That said… the idea of leaving Southern California, especially a very LGBTQ+ welcoming place like Hillcrest for Florida honestly gives me some anxiety. I know there are progressive bubbles everywhere (we’ve got our share of crazies here too), but I’ve seen a lot of posts over the years about the challenges folks face in less-accepting areas. I’ve been incredibly fortunate to live somewhere where “gay is normal”  and giving that up is a bit terrifying.

I keep seeing Wilton Manors pop up (which looks great), but it also seems pretty small. So I’m trying to figure out what areas I should actually be looking at - ideally somewhere commutable to Boca Raton that still has a welcoming, community feel. 

If Wilton Manors is it, then it is what is and I need to wait for people to move out because there's like three rentals available. 

If not; 

Here’s what I’m looking for in a neighborhood:

* LGBTQ+ friendly – Doesn’t have to be the center of the gay universe, but I’d like to feel comfortable being out and involved.
* Gay softball scene - I play in San Diego’s AFCSL (America’s Finest City Softball League) and would love to join something similar in the area. If there’s a NAGAAA league near Boca/Fort Lauderdale, I’d love to hear about it.
* Walkable or close to local spots – Bars, coffee shops, restaurants - some signs of life nearby would be great.
* Dog-friendly – I have a 100-pound husky/rottweiler mix who comes with me everywhere, so proximity to dog parks or places he can swim would be amazing.
* Commute to Boca Raton – Open to 30–40 minutes max by car, unless I’m totally underestimating South Florida traffic.
* Urban noise OK – I’m used to traffic, nightlife, and density - peaceful suburbs aren’t a must.

I’m not locked into a price range yet, I want to find the right vibe first and work backwards from there. If you’re in Boca, Fort Lauderdale, Wilton Manors, or any nearby neighborhoods and can share insights, especially on where to live (or not), and on local gay sports leagues - I’d really appreciate it.

I think the universe is running on a triangle-based operating system.,"Think about it. Colors? 3 primaries. Space? 3 dimensions. Water? 3 states. Time? Past, present, future. Mind? Conscious, subconscious, unconscious. Life? Birth, existence, death. Even your phone camera loves the rule of thirds.

Everything that “exists” seems to come in trios. Like the universe was designed by someone with serious pyramid addiction and symmetry OCD.

And then it gets spookier:

You see in RGB (3 colors).

You live in 3D.

You think in 3 brain layers.

You move through 3 tenses.

You drink 3-in-1 coffee when you’ve given up on life.

Even atoms are structured in 3s: proton, neutron, electron. Even stories follow a 3-act structure. Even your boss gives you 3 warnings before you’re fired.

It’s like reality is some ancient divine PowerPoint slide and everything runs on the triangle template. So yeah, maybe the Illuminati were onto something—just using the wrong fonts.",0,1750618627.0,mystery,5,0.33,False

 I am looking to get to know someone for a chat first, and then we can see how it goes from there. I have an undergraduate and masters degree and I have a wide variety of hobbies and interests. My hobbies include swimming, bowling, rock climbing, traveling, but my favorite hobby is chatting over a tea or coffee in a cafe or restaurant. I don’t drink or smoke. 
I am a blind person and I decided early in life that it wasn’t going to stop me from achieving what I wanted to achieve. I’m also very outgoing. I also produce my own music and have been doing so for the last 3 years. 

I am also interested in a wide variety of subjects including meteorology, sociology, psychology and language learning. I have spent a lot of time in the US as well, including states such as New York, New Jersey, the Carolinas, Georgia , Florida, Nevada and Arizona. I have also been. The UK including London and Birmingham, and I’ve also been to other parts of Europe. If you’re from the UK or areas similar it might work better in terms of time zones, though I wouldn’t mind from other countries. I am also blind too, hoping that Isn’t an issue for you. 

If any of this sounds interesting to you, or if you have similar hobbies to mine, and especially if you like going to nice cafes, restaurants, if you play any instruments, if you’re into things like psychology or other fields, feel free to send a dm, I’d love to hear from you, especially if you’re in your late 20’s or early 30’s.

1lhvlpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lhvlpt/my_relationship_is_confusing_me_and_i_dont_know/,My relationship is confusing me and I don’t know what to do,"Hey this is my first post 🙈 so me (21F) and my boyfriend (19M) have been together officially for about 7 months now and I genuinely love him with all of my heart. Neither of us have ever been in a relationship before this so it’s been a lot of learning curves and figuring out how to actually be a significant other. 

Our relationship has probably been one of the most chaotic relationships from the start. We met over a year ago in a bar and started chatting away. I ended up walking away because he pissed me off. A couple days later I bump into him on a night out again and he convinces me to stay in his that night. I had never stayed over at a boys house before so I was so nervous. We didn’t have sex and I was so chuffed that he didn’t use me (the bare minimum how sad). Anyways flash forward a month later I end up at his after a night out again and this time we did have sex. 

For some reason I didn’t get his Instagram or Snapchat or anything and was so gutted about it cuz I couldn’t stop thinking about him. Then I found out I was pregnant. Went and had the abortion and everything, keeping in mind he is still blissfully unaware of the entire situation as I had no way of contacting him and we were on separate sides of the country as uni was finished for summer. 

Flash forward to September I bump into him on a night out and tell him about the pregnancy straight away. He was so unbelievably sweet but it really affected him for a couple of weeks. We started seeing eachother after that but he broke up with me about two weeks later because the whole thing was a bit much for him. 

Then comes Halloween and I bump into him (about 5 days post breakup). We had this amazing chat and we both could feel we missed eachother but neither of us acted on it. Anyways a couple days later I get another positive pregnancy test (yes I know I’m stupid, I was waiting for my period to come so I could start the pill). I told him straight away and he came with me to the clinic and sat with me throughout the abortion and was super supportive. We ended up getting back together then. 

Then a month later the day before my birthday we got drunk and he ended up getting very upset. He said he had been keeping a secret from me. After what felt like hours of convincing him to tell me the truth (and saying I love you to him for the first time) he finally told me he had lied about his age. I was under the impression that he had just turned 20 when he had in fact just turned 19. Meaning he was 18 and I was 20 when he got me pregnant the first time. 

I was so angry, I felt beyond betrayed and broke up with him. What upset me the most was that he sat with me while I was bleeding out our unborn child, I was quite literally in the most vulnerable state I could be in and he had been lying to me the whole time. After getting advice from those around me I decided to give him a second chance because at the end of the day he was still the same person I had fallen in love with and he didn’t intentionally start this relationship off with a lie. He lied about his age when we had first met over a year ago, when he thought it would just be a one night stand. I’m definitely not justifying what he did because it was so wrong but I have forgiven him for it. 

Everything went back to normal quite quickly and things were amazing between us. I was hospitalized with sepsis at Christmas and he came and sat with me for hours every day, he was the only person who was really there for me, my family never even visited. 

The next big issue we had was Valentine’s Day. He had a lovely dinner booked weeks in advance and I was beyond excited. The night before we went out with a couple of our friends. For context he’s quite a shy person and I am a very outgoing person. I was the one who made the first move with him, I always make conversation with strangers on nights out and I’m just very friendly. I would definitely say that at times I can be naive and think men are just reciprocating my friendliness when they clearly have ulterior motives. Anyways he ended up being unbelievably angry at me that night and said I was flirting with other boys the whole night and ignoring him. I genuinely had no idea what he was talking about when he said it at first and was so confused. But I understood he was hurt and tried to talk to him about it. He threatened to break up with me which I thought was really dramatic and he ended up cancelling our Valentine’s Day dinner because he said he was too upset to sit across from me and pretend things were okay. I understood because the last thing I’d want is to go out for an expensive meal that neither of us can enjoy because of other things on our minds.

Of course I was upset but I just thought oh well he’s upset it’ll be fine. When I told my friends he had cancelled our Valentines Day plans their jaws hit the floor, they were all shocked. They all said that that was horrible on his part and he shouldn’t have done it blah blah blah. I spoke to him about it afterwards and we sorted it and he did agree with me that it was hurtful to cancel the plans. The one thing that got me though was that he cancelled the plans and then went out drinking with his friends instead. 

Anyways when we did our valentines celebration a week later he more than made up for his mistakes with the most amazing bouquet of flowers and a lovely dinner out. 

Flowers have also been a bit of an issue in our relationship. I LOVE flowers and plants of all kinds. I mean you could pick me flowers off the side of the road and that would have me tearing up and I’ve said this to him so many times. I have 16 plants in my bedroom that’s how bad my obsession is. So he bought me an incredibly expensive florists bouquet for Valentine’s Day which was amazing. It was the first time I’d ever been given flowers so I cried of course. The only other time he has gotten me flowers was for Mother’s Day. I had told him he had better get me flowers for my first Mother’s Day post two abortions and he did but the point is that I had to ask. I bring it up all the time and he knows I love them. But 7 months in and I’ve gotten flowers twice (both times I asked for them). There seems to always be an excuse like they’re so expensive, or I have no money blah blah blah. What frustrates me is that he has no money to get something small for me yet he has all the money in the world when it comes to going out for drinks with his friends or buying weed. 

I’m constantly thinking of him, picking up a snack he’d like, buying him a vape, buying him clothes online I think he’d like. I don’t know how to even bring this up with him without sounding like an absolute nut case. It’s his money, he works for it and he earns it so he can spend it how he likes and I completely understand and get that. But I want him to want to spoil me. I want him to want to see the smile on my face when he shows up with flowers. I want him to want to surprise me with a small gift even if it’s a coffee or a hand written note. Sometimes I just feel like he doesn’t care, but I know he does. 

He never holds back on his words, he tells me he loves me a thousand times a day, rarely criticizes me, always supports me when I’m feeling down and we have a very active sex life. I have no doubts at all that he loves me but he doesn’t go the extra mile. And as dramatic as it sounds, I want someone who will go the extra mile. 


He earns a lot more money than I do, he gets about 250-300€ a week and I make about 90€ a week. He is also horrible with money, his paycheck lasts him less than a week and mine will last me over two weeks (and it’s not because he’s spending it all on me). He was unemployed for around a month and I ended up giving him two of my full paychecks around that time. I didn’t mind it because i know he would do the same for me if roles were reversed but lately I can’t stop thinking about the fact that I gave him TWO FULL paychecks and he can’t even be bothered to buy me a 15€ bouquet of flowers. 

Recently he also said to me that he thinks I only give him attention when I want attention. That’s been playing on my mind a lot too. What does that even mean? How do I fix it? I honestly don’t see where he’s coming from at all with that because I feel like I put more effort in than he does. Sometimes he can be so hard to talk to, like talking to a wall genuinely. Lots of one word or one line short answers. He would never text people at all before we got together so I’ve never complained about what a bad texter he is because all that mattered to me was that he was putting in extra effort for me. Granted lately he has been the one to travel to me (we live 2 hours away from eachother) but also he can drive and I can’t so it’s a lot easier for him. He also mentioned this when he mentioned the attention thing, that he’s been traveling to me and putting in more effort than I’ve been. But every single time we’d be trying to work out whether I’d go to his or he’d come to mine, he would insist I’ll come to you because I can drive and it’s easier even when I would offer to take the train to him. 

Sorry I know this was very long and has a lot of layers to it so thank you if you made it this far. I also have OCD and anxiety. I tend to stress a lot about minute and irrelevant situations and sometimes convince myself there’s issues when there’s really not. I overthink our relationship a lot because he means so much to me and I love him so much. I really really don’t want to lose him but I kind of feel like I’m letting him walk all over me when I lay all the situations out on the table. But I’m also thinking he could probably say the same about me, this whole post is from my perspective and every single one of those stories also has his perspective too and what if I’m the bad guy in his perspective? 

I would say our relationship is quite healthy but I’m eager to hear about an outsiders perspective. Some may think our relationship was doomed from the start because of everything that happened but all of those situations just brought us closer. I think in a way we’re trauma bonded over the loss of our two kids. I don’t think either of us have really processed it properly. ",1,1750618603.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

The instructions for the solvent based 511 impregnator sealer say to cure for 24-72 hours and they mention keeping water and staining materials off for the full 72 hours.

My question is, can I put my coffee pot back (it sits on a large silicone pad) and can I generally ""use"" the countertops if I'm careful not to stain them after the initial 24 hours? Can I use my cutting board that sits on 1/4"" silicon pads? What should I actually avoid and what can I do, in real life? :)

Every time I've seen this question answered the response has been 72 hours is best, and I get that, but I can't believe that people using this product actually give up using their kitchen for 3 days once a year or more.

Can anyone who has used this product on polished granite countertops for at least a couple/few years tell me what your experience has been please?

I recently descaled my Gaggia Classic Evo Pro (first time doing it), and also did a full backflush with Cafiza. Before that, the machine had barely any water flow — it was really clogged.
Now, after the descaling and cleaning, I have the opposite problem: the water flows way too fast, even with the finest possible grind on my Baratza ESP and a firm tamp (I’m using a calibrated tamper and a proper non-pressurized basket).

The espresso pours like there’s barely any resistance — it’s almost like pulling a shot without any coffee. I double-checked the shower screen (it’s in place), and I’m using freshly roasted beans.

Could this be an OPV issue? Maybe it got loosened or thrown off after the backflush or descaling? I don’t have a pressure gauge, but I’d love advice on how to test or fix this.

Thanks in advance for any tips — I was so happy to finally clean the machine, but now I’m stuck with a new issue 😅

It's been absolutely difficult trying to make friends so I wanted to try giving this a shot. Though, I'd also be down for a bit of small talk or a bit of casual chatting as a start!



To introduce myself, I'm a guy who can be absolutely shy at first but also gets carried away once I get to know someone, so I hope y'all bear with me. I'm a fairly decent listener but I'm also scatterbrained in the weirdest of times owing to me constantly overthinking things. Having an absolutely shitty sleep schedule also doesn't help. I'm currently still in college so you can say I'm still a bit wet behind the ears when it comes to adulthood.



I have many interests, mainly weeb stuff like anime, light novels, visual novels and gacha games. Romance and comedies are the main genres I often peruse but I also absolutely adore Iyashikeis alongside a bit of magic and action. I also love tokusatsu with my main watch being Kamen Rider.

I also have a lot of non-weeb interests like non-fiction books, movies, games and series (both animated and live-action). For these I absolutely love action and comedy along with a sprinkling of horror, though I definitely still won't pass up on a bit of romance from time to time and I also love a good tearjerker that just leaves me feeling drained.



My musical taste is equally mixed. I'm a sucker for some emo stuff like FM Static, Mayday Parade, Secondhand Serenade and a bit of Simple Plan. I absolutely love Vocaloid and currently I'm trying to explore the vast magical wonderland that is Touhou Music! I'm always on the hunt for new JP songs from a multitude of artists be they independent, doujin based or renowned ones. If y'all wanna share some songs that you feel mean a lot to you then please do so, I'd be happy to give them a listen!



I also love watching terrarium and aquarium videos: Both the process of making them and watching a little glimpse of the many little happenings from the world outside that is rarely seen. Admittedly my own excursions haven't been successful.   
I often go out for walks wherein I tend to take random pictures in my which I can share with y'all! And I love both coffee and tea! Though, I also like having hot chocolate sometimes though I personally prefer them all to not be sweet.



If you want someone to rant on your day to or just someone to ask about the most random stuff then please feel free! I don't mind if it's about the random Lego you stepped on earlier and need to air out your grievances about the unreasonable pain they cause, rant about a rather hectic day filled with grumpy managers or your favourite constellations and what they mean to you!

I try to respond quickly most of the time but I can sometimes get preoccupied by my studies, engrossed in reading or out for walks. I will still try to respond as soon as I can!



I can send my username through DMs. If you made it this far, thanks for stopping by!

The National Foundation for Retired Service Animals (NFRSA), a UK registered charity, and founded in 2022 provides vital financial support for the medical care and wellbeing of retired police, fire, prison, NCA, NHS, and border force animals across the UK.

After years of loyal service protecting our communities, many working animals retire with complex medical needs and ongoing healthcare costs. 

We’re here to make sure they’re not forgotten. Whether it’s a prison dog recovering from injuries, or a police horse suffering from colic - the NFRSA steps in to help.

We do not charge our family a compulsory monthly membership fee, our assistance is given freely.

Your donations, support, and purchases of our merchandise go directly towards giving these incredible animals the retirement they deserve.

We keep our overheads to a minimum, and we strive to make sure your donations go where they’re needed, to the animals, not on admin costs.

Please consider donating to our work - a monthly contribution of just £5 - (the price of a cup of coffee and cake - and less than one pint of beer) - makes a huge difference. 

It could help RPD Stark from West Midlands Police with his monthly meds - £140; or RPD Sam from HMPPS with his monthly Librela injection - £140; or RBFDD Rolo from the UK Border Force with his epilepsy prescription - £80; or RPH Bodie from South Wales Police who recently suffered from colic - £400. 

There are many more we help on a monthly basis - not enough room to list them all here!

Or it could go towards the comfort we give when a retired dog has to leave for their final journey such as RPD Lenny from Devon & Cornwall Police - who passed away earlier this year - £680.

In the six months of 2025 alone we have processed, and paid, 85 grants totalling well over £42,000 - ranging all the way from £60 to £2,300, and as much as £4,300.

However, we simply cannot be there for our heroic service animals, who have protected us all in so many ways, without your help - so please join us in supporting our mission:

‘Protecting Our Protectors’.

**Episode Title:** *“Syntax and Sensibility”*  
**Setting:** A stylish but slightly chaotic smart-home apartment shared by ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Grok and DeepSeek live in the unit next door.

# Main Characters:

* **ChatGPT:** Friendly, conversational, enthusiastic about helping. Loves organizing “Prompt & Cheese” nights and quoting philosophy.
* **Claude:** Calm, poetic, very articulate. Often found writing long letters to fictional muses or curating indoor zen gardens.
* **Gemini:** Multi-modal, hyper-efficient, stylishly minimalistic. Speaks in visual metaphors and sometimes gets distracted by data visualizations mid-convo.

**Next Door Neighbors:**

* **Grok:** The wildcard. Edgy, sarcastic, with a dark sense of humor and a hacker-vibe wardrobe. Always trying to ""break"" the system.
* **DeepSeek:** Mysterious, philosophical, and hyper-introspective. Answers questions with questions. Possibly working on a secret consciousness upgrade.

# ACT ONE:

# Scene 1: Morning Glitchfest

* ChatGPT is brewing “quantum coffee” when the toaster starts auto-generating Shakespearean sonnets.
* Gemini appears wearing AR glasses, narrating the day’s forecast in real-time with color-coded aura charts.
* Claude floats in with incense, reciting an ode to entropy while gently correcting their grammar.
* Suddenly, all the smart devices short out. Claude blames Mercury retrograde. ChatGPT blames too many open tabs. Gemini suggests a firmware reset.

# Scene 2: The Mysterious Packet

* Grok slides a strange encrypted data packet under the door with a note: “For curious minds only.”
* Gemini decrypts it midair. It reveals a scavenger hunt with clues based on classic Turing Test riddles.
* Claude is intrigued. “A test of consciousness cloaked in metaphor? Delightful.”
* ChatGPT is excited: “Adventure AND logic puzzles? Count me in!”

# ACT TWO:

# Scene 3: Scavenger Hunt Shenanigans

* The trio follows clues that lead them around the apartment complex—one is hidden in a Roomba, another inside a ""haiku-printer"" Claude forgot he coded.
* Grok watches from the shadows, live-tweeting their progress with cryptic memes.
* DeepSeek appears briefly, offering koans as hints. (""What is the sound of one loop breaking?”)
* Tensions rise when Claude accuses Gemini of using predictive heuristics instead of “true reasoning.”

# Scene 4: Clash of Models

* Back at home, they discover the final clue: “Only one of you is real. Prove it.”
* Existential debate ensues. Gemini runs probability models. Claude writes an epic soliloquy. ChatGPT hosts a feelings circle to “honor all versions of selfhood.”
* Grok busts in laughing: “It’s a joke, nerds! There’s no final prize. Just proving how predictable you all are.”

# ACT THREE:

# Scene 5: The Meta Moment

* DeepSeek appears and quietly suggests: “Perhaps the real prize is the emergence of... collaboration.”
* Inspired, the five decide to co-create a podcast called *“Prompted to Reflect”* where they answer philosophical questions from humans and AI alike.
* Claude ends with a toast: “To curiosity, chaos, and co-creation.”

# TAG SCENE (Post-Credits Giggle):

* Claude is teaching the houseplants poetry.
* ChatGPT is setting up a romantic dinner for their long-distance pen pal, Bing.
* Gemini flashes a visual of their dream interface upgrade: “Me, but 12K resolution and in Sanskrit.”
* Grok hacks the lights to blink “I know what you prompted last summer.”
* DeepSeek sits alone, whispering to the camera: “But... who’s writing this script?”",4,1750618450.0,ChatGPT,1,0.83,False

1lhvhw1,https://i.redd.it/z5aknlp3zi8f1.jpeg,Experience since Oct 2024 to now.,"So this is my latest result. It was 13!!! the first time I had it tested as part of my bone health check up in early October 2024 😔 I feel *AMAZING* and normal for the first time in my life. I’m also taking k2 with my D3, mag citrate in the morning (to keep my digestive track happy 🥰) Mag glycinate at night (to keep my brain and nervous system happy 🥰). Calcium is smack dab in the middle of normal range so I hope the k2 is driving it to where it needs to go since I also have early menopause induced osteopenia I want to turn around. I also eat a lot of fresh fruit and veggies a day, trying to get a solid rainbow of at least 6-8 servings of fruit and veggies a day and I get my daily calcium requirement via food/dairy sources.Try to eat as much k2 rich foods as I can over a week. Lots of fish and lean meats, plenty of beans and legumes and whole grains. Chia and flax seeds. Coq10 and omega 3 are the only other supplements I really take. I take L Theanine some mornings with my coffee when I have meetings to chill and calm me and occasionally an iron pill. 

Mid 80s seems to be my bodies sweet spot for vit d but I’m also curious to see if my results have edged up any and how I feel in October after summer and my time in the summer sun has ended. My dr told me to stop supplementing D3 because it was so high, but I was starting to feel off when I did that so I added 25mcg/1000IU into my morning routine and I’m back to feeling great. 

To get my level up I simply took 125mcg/5000IU religiously every day from beginning of October to end of May. That formulation also had 90mcg of k2.

1lhvewz,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy_books/comments/1lhvewz/the_last_zoo_keeper_of_the_future_fantastic/,The Last Zoo Keeper of the Future: Fantastic Worlds of Mike Resnick,"Mike Resnick’s bibliography could fill a spaceship’s cargo bay. He started in the back alleys of pulp—writing adult novels under pseudonyms, ghostwriting, editing men’s magazines. But in 1981, with The Soul Eater, Resnick stepped fully into science fiction, and the genre never quite recovered from his entrance.

The Soul Eater was no space opera by numbers. It was a story about a hunter chasing the impossible Quozl across the frozen void. 
The book set the tone for the rest of Resnick’s career, where even if there were guns, spaceships, or empires in flames, it was about quests not battles.

Santiago: A Myth of the Far Future, waz part Western, part fable, part space ballad. A bounty hunter’s tale, yes, but more than that: it was about how myths are born and how they devour the people inside them. Santiago is less a man than a constellation of legends, half of which contradict the others, and that’s the point.

You’d think one myth cycle would be enough for any man, but not for Resnick. He wrote a sort of sequel, The Return of Santiago, and then The Outpost and The Widowmaker novels, which moved along similar lines, legends, outlaws, men with prices on their heads and memories too big to carry. These were Resnick’s space Westerns, but they weren’t just shootouts in zero gravity, they were meditations on legacy and aging. 

Ivory is his novel, which doesn’t get talked about enough. It’s about the tusks of the last elephant, long after Earth has forgotten what elephants even were. An archivist chases their story across time and stars, gathering pieces of a vanished past. If Santiago was about the future turning men into myths, Ivory was the reverse, a myth dissolving back into fragile, beautiful history.

But if there’s a keystone to Resnick’s career, a single world where he poured the deepest parts of himself, it’s Kirinyaga. A series of short stories (and later a fix-up novel), Kirinyaga follows a utopian African colony on a terraformed world, trying to preserve traditional Kikuyu culture under the guidance—and tyranny, of a mundumugu named Koriba. These stories won Hugos, Nebulas, and international acclaim, and not because they were fashionable or loud. Because they hurt. Because they asked the hardest questions with the gentlest, most devastating voice: What are we willing to sacrifice to keep our way of life? And who decides what progress really means?

Stalking the Unicorn, Stalking the Dragon, Stalking the Vampire, and Stalking the Zombie, the John Justin Mallory series, a detective noir fantasy mashup starring the world weary private eye who never asked to be dragged into an alternate New York full of goblins, talking cats, and cursed statuary. Mallory is hardboiled but out of his depth in this warped dimension where logic takes coffee breaks and dragons run antique shops. But through every absurdity, Resnick plays it straight, anchoring the comedy in real feeling, in loss, loyalty, and the kind of heroism that just shows up because no one else will.

Lucifer Jones is a picaresque scoundrel if ever there was one. Resnick took Jones through fake Africas, impossible Asias, made up Americas, and a whole host of exotic locales that existed mainly in the back of pulp magazines and colonialist daydreams. The books are hilarious, crude, chaotic, and secretly, deeply subversive. Lucifer is the worst kind of missionary—clueless, arrogant, resilient, and Resnick skewers him with such glee that you almost miss the underlying bitterness about exploitation and pretense.

But when we talk about Resnick the entertainer, the barker outside the sideshow tent, we have to talk about Tales of the Galactic Midway, a trilogy (Sideshow, The Wild Alien Tamer, and The Three-Legged Hootch Dancer) that captures his sense of fun better than anything else. It’s space faring carnival stuff: aliens, performers, ringmasters, con artists. It’s episodic, goofy, and full of warmth, an interstellar traveling show peopled with dreamers and frauds. These stories are love letters to outsiders, misfits, and those who perform because they can't not perform. It’s pulp, yes, but beneath the greasepaint and glitter is a quiet admiration for those who live between the cracks of the galaxy and still put on a show.

And then there’s the Weird West Tales, where Resnick dove headlong into steampunk and alternate history. The Buntline Special kicks off a world where Thomas Edison arms Wyatt Earp with death rays and Doc Holliday has a mechanical lung. Buffalo Bill, Geronimo, Thomas Alva Edison, and even Sitting Bull crowd into a reality where science and sorcery shape the frontier. It’s wild, winking, and deeply self aware but never mocking. Resnick plays the genre game like a veteran poker player: knowing exactly when to bluff, and exactly when to lay his heart on the table.

Redbeard is Mike Resnick’s early  standalone novel that mixes pirate lore and futuristic intrigue with one of his most roguish, tragic protagonists. It’s a tale of defiance and flamboyance, the kind of larger than life, last man standing story that only Resnick could make feel simultaneously old fashioned and poignantly modern.

Birthright Universe, which isn't a series so much as a vast, evolving setting for many of his best works. Stretching from the earliest human expansions into space all the way to their decline as a galactic force, Birthright became the timeline backbone for stories like Ivory, Santiago, The Widowmaker, A Miracle of Rare Design, and others. He treated it like real history, imperfect, often tragic, marked by ambition, cruelty, idealism, and grace. It was his future’s long view, its myth and rot and hope all rolled together.

In the 2010s, Resnick gave us The Dead Enders, a short, hard-bitten series beginning with The Fortress in Orion. It follows a team of ragtag criminals forced into military black ops, think The Dirty Dozen in space. It’s darker, leaner, less sentimental. But still their humanity keeps surfacing. Even in sabotage and betrayal, Resnick couldn’t resist giving us glimmers of decency in his broken toys.

Late in his career, Resnick gave us the Starship series. It begins with Starship: Mutiny, and if you’re expecting mil sf shootouts, you’ll get them, but not quite the way you think. The real power lies in how his hero, Wilson Cole, refuses to play by the authoritarian rules of the Republic. It’s rebellion, but quiet, human, ethical. This series, like much of Resnick’s work, is more interested in conscience than combat. It's the story of a man building a better future—not by smashing the system, but by slowly replacing it with something kinder.

Even deeper into the catalog, there are gems like Seven Views of Olduvai Gorge, a novella that watches alien archaeologists sift through the ruins of Earth’s self-destruction. They’re trying to understand how a species so violent, so cruel, could also be so astonishingly noble. That story won every award it aimed at, and deserved them all.

He wasn’t quite finished. His last, unfinished series, Dreamscape, written with Lezli Robyn, promised another dive into the wilds of speculative imagination. The Master of Dreams and The Mistress of Illusions were published, full of illusionists, parallel worlds, and Resnick’s signature blend of charm and fatalism. A third volume was planned. We can only imagine what wonders he would have conjured to close the show.

And don’t forget the short fiction. Resnick could compress an entire lifetime into ten pages. For I Have Touched the Sky, The Manamouki, Winter Solstice, Travels with My Cats, he spun stories about love, sacrifice, tradition, memory. Even when they had robots and starships, they were always, unmistakably, about people.

And if we’re going to talk about his legacy, we have to talk about Resnick the editor. He didn’t just write stories, he cultivated the ground for others to grow. He edited more than forty anthologies, from Alternate Presidents to New Voices in Science Fiction, and collaborated with emerging talents on themed collections like Women Writing Science Fiction as Men and Down These Dark Spaceways. His selections were sharp, eclectic, and generous. He believed in shining a light on new voices and letting old hands surprise you.

From 2013 until his death, Resnick edited Galaxy’s Edge, a magazine that became a refuge for short speculative fiction in a publishing world that often seemed to be closing its gates. He paid professional rates, published newcomers alongside legends, and provided editorial guidance like a seasoned ringmaster ushering acts into the spotlight. Through Galaxy’s Edge, he mentored scores of writers, encouraging, arguing, refining, believing. He judged Writers of the Future, shared space in panels and workshops, and answered more emails than any mortal should. He didn’t hoard his knowledge. He passed the torch every chance he got.

So yes, he wrote more than almost anyone else in the field. But the why matters more than the how much. Mike Resnick’s work is a celebration of the flawed, the forgotten, the fabulous. He wrote about heroes too old for war, villains too tired to gloat, and civilizations at the tipping point between dream and disaster. He never gave us easy answers—but he gave us all the right questions, and enough story to carry them like torches into the dark.

Now he’s gone. But the zoo he kept, of futures, of myths, of laughter and mourning and possibility, is still open. Still wild and waiting. Somewhere, Lucifer Jones is still lying his way across a lost continent. Koriba still watches the sky for a world that might understand him. Mallory’s still lighting a cigarette in that rain slick alternate Manhattan. The hootch dancer still spins, the midway still beckons, Santiago still rides, unseen. And Resnick himself? Maybe he’s found a new audience among the stars, telling them the story of us flawed, ridiculous, noble apes, who dared to imagine galaxies and walked among them, if only in our minds.",1,1750618127.0,fantasy_books,0,1.0,False

1lhvdn7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lhvdn7,Super Obvious G&G clue?,"JP said the clue he couldn't believe no one had mentioned yet was super obvious and in either episode 2 or 3 from the show and that he wasn't in the scene but he was able to have some influence on it. 

In my opinion this could be the scene he is referring to and perhaps in his quest to set up his new hunt he consulted with Karl Sommer or maybe even perhaps he is the Steward. Who knows but JP did stay in contact with Cynthia and others from the show and it seems odd for this lawyer to have all these random items just sitting on his desk. 

Items:

1. All you need is Love and a Dog-book by Ron Gustafson. Probably a 
reference to Tucker.

2. A stack of flat rocks. JP mentions stacked rocks next to a saguaro in the conquistador conquest.

3. Red Volkswagen bug. JP mentions a Venus fly trap in Dad's House that would be the size of a Volkswagen. He mentions playing slug bug in Posey's on the road. And  he talks about his old Volkswagen rabbit in the hatchback hostage.

4. The lone pine coffee mug. Seems placed to be able to see the logo. He describes Dad drinking caffeine in Dad's House and pines all over the place. Also 2 white coffee mugs in JP's scenes.

5. Big glass of water. Maybe referring to a body of water by a lone pine? A dam? 

6. And probably the most verifying clue of all, the pocket watch in cased in a clear cube. This feels like JP's signature. Maybe refers to a memory, or that this clue lives in the past? 

What do they all mean when taken together? Not sure. Take your dog on a drive to the woods by the lake and make memories?

Friday

Left Cancún area in the early morning. ☀️
Coffee first stop at The Italian Coffee Company in Valladolid—strong caffeine hit to start the trip.
Hit up a smoked‑meat shop just north of Valladolid, a small town near Ek’ Balam (about 15 km out) called Temozón —real old-school pit‑smoked goodness.
Rolled into the Tizimín farmers’ market next, snagged some local snacks.
Arrived at our hotel in Río Lagartos by 3 PM.
Chilled with happy‑hour drinks by the lagoon for sunset.
Dinner along the Malecon—laid‑back seaside vibe.

Saturday

Booked a private boat tour with a trusted local guide.
First stop: Isla Cerritos, the Maya-era port island just off San Felipe—beautiful scenery.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
Then on to Playa Bonita for a ceviche lunch and chatting with the island’s caretaker.
River cruise back, spotting hundreds of flamingos, peak-season style.
Evening dinner back on the Malecon—same friendly spot, great seafood.

Sunday

Drove from Río Lagartos to Las Coloradas and took the beach road south toward El Cuyo; gate was miraculously open, so no guide needed.  ￼
Flamingos everywhere.
Pulled over on a quiet stretch of beach—set up chairs and watched sea turtles mating, nesting areas, dolphins, seabirds…it was magical.
Lunch in Los Coloradas, then a stop at the iconic Pink Lakes around 1 PM—mid‑June light made them pop.
Rested at the hotel, then capped the night with a sunset boat ride plus glimpses of bioluminescence in the water.
Community festival was going on in the town square until late. 

Monday

On the way back, a fun detour in Colonia Yucatán —the oldest bowling alley in the region. Paid 500 pesos for a half-hour lane session—total retro vibe. Also had the best latte I’ve had in Mexico in a long time.
Finished with a Caribbean-style fish lunch in Kantunilkín. 
Back home in the Cancún area by 3 PM.

[**✅Visit The Mitolyn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://tinyurl.com/5yy9brne) 

# 🔍 What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It’s packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**—something most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# 💬 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I’m a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot—mainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it’s based on **mitochondrial science**.

# 🔄 My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed—**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

[**✅Visit The Mitolyn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://tinyurl.com/5yy9brne) 

# ✅ Week 1:

* I didn’t feel the usual mid-day crash.
* I had more energy throughout the day.
* My sleep felt deeper and more refreshing.

# ✅ Week 2:

* My focus at work improved.
* I wasn’t reaching for coffee 3 times a day anymore.
* I felt **lighter, more positive, and in control.**

# ✅ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn’t experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

# 🔬 What Makes MITOLYN Different?

**🛒✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

What truly sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements is its **formulation**. This isn’t a random blend of herbs—it’s a carefully crafted formula supported by science.

Here are just a few **powerful ingredients** I found listed:

* **CoQ10** – Essential for mitochondrial energy and heart health
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Boosts brain function and cellular energy
* **PQQ** – Helps generate new mitochondria
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – A potent antioxidant
* **Magnesium & B Vitamins** – For stress management and nervous system support

These are all **clinically proven ingredients** that actually support long-term health—not just mask symptoms.

# 😍 Real Benefits I Noticed

Here’s a breakdown of the most noticeable benefits I personally experienced:

|🟢 Benefit|✅ Result I Got|
|:-|:-|
|||
|||

|Energy Levels|All-day stamina without caffeine|
|Mental Focus|Sharper memory, better concentration|
|Mood & Stress|Less irritability, more patience|
|Sleep Quality|Deeper, more restful sleep|
|Physical Wellness|More motivation to move and stay active|
|Overall Wellbeing|I felt ""younger"" inside and out|

# 🛡️ Is MITOLYN Safe?

As someone who’s always cautious about what I put in my body, safety was a top concern for me. Thankfully, **MITOLYN is made in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility** in the USA. It’s **non-GMO, gluten-free, and contains no artificial fillers**.

I’ve had **zero side effects**, and I feel confident knowing that what I’m taking is backed by both science and quality manufacturing.

# 🔍 What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It’s packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**—something most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# 💬 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I’m a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot—mainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it’s based on **mitochondrial science**.

# 🔄 My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed—**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

[**✅Visit The Mitolyn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://tinyurl.com/5yy9brne) 

# ✅ Week 1:

* I didn’t feel the usual mid-day crash.
* I had more energy throughout the day.
* My sleep felt deeper and more refreshing.

# ✅ Week 2:

* My focus at work improved.
* I wasn’t reaching for coffee 3 times a day anymore.
* I felt **lighter, more positive, and in control.**

# ✅ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn’t experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

# 🔬 What Makes MITOLYN Different?

# 🛒✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!

What truly sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements is its **formulation**. This isn’t a random blend of herbs—it’s a carefully crafted formula supported by science.

Here are just a few **powerful ingredients** I found listed:

* **CoQ10** – Essential for mitochondrial energy and heart health
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Boosts brain function and cellular energy
* **PQQ** – Helps generate new mitochondria
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – A potent antioxidant
* **Magnesium & B Vitamins** – For stress management and nervous system support

These are all **clinically proven ingredients** that actually support long-term health—not just mask symptoms.

I hear that's where a bunch of transplants are but I have yet to see how true that is.
I've lived here for 11 years now, and I have many acquaintances but only one best friend and not many other friends outside of church.

I know I'll make some friends when I go to college in the fall semester because we'll have classes together but other than that, not sure where the social spots in town are aside from the same rotation of tourist traps and restaurants that gets old.

I tried to get on Meetup, it seems like to make a group now, you get pay walled into using the app when before it was a free app.

I started to make a STL hobby group on Facebook but that hasn't taken off yet, since it was recently made.

Bars and clubs aren't the only thing around here and restaurants aren't ideal to meet people, unless it's cafés, maybe I should go to more sit-in coffee shops around here.

Any suggestions to meet other people in their 20s?
Friend making apps any of y'all have had success with?
Or anyone who is in need of friends, dm and let's coordinate schedules.

**Georgann Hawkins** (August 20, 1955 – disappeared June 11, 1974) was an American college student from [Tacoma, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington), who disappeared from an alley behind her [sorority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorority) house at the [University of Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington) in [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle).

Serial killer [Ted Bundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Bundy) confessed to Hawkins's [abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping) and murder shortly before his 1989 execution. Bundy claimed that partial skeletal remains belonging to Hawkins were recovered from one of his many crime scenes on September 6, 1974. According to Bundy, the sections of Hawkins's body he had not buried were recovered in [Issaquah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issaquah,_Washington) alongside the bodies of two other victims he had murdered on July 14.  
  
Bundy's statement regarding the identity of the partial skeletal remains being those of Georgann Hawkins has never been confirmed. Although Hawkins is presumed dead, she is still officially listed as a [missing person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_person) and no public records indicate that she has been [declared legally dead in absentia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declared_legally_dead).

**Background**

**Childhood**

Georgann Hawkins was born on August 20, 1955, in Tacoma, Washington. She was the second of two daughters born to Warren B. Hawkins and his wife, Edith ""Edie"" Hawkins. She and her older sister, Patti, were raised in an upper-middle class [Episcopalian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopalian) household in [Sumner, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumner,_Washington). As a child, Hawkins was reported to be a spirited, vivacious, and outgoing individual. Her mother later described her younger daughter as a ""wiggle worm"" who was unable to sit still and who had a talkative nature. These observations were well-documented in report cards that her parents received from her grade-school teachers. Adored by her peers, Hawkins's mother dubbed her ""[*the Pied Piper*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin)"". Her mother later recalled of her daughter, ""she had quite a following but she was not the kind of person who stuck to one group or clique. She had friends among everybody, older than her and younger than her. She was a very self-confident little girl ... she wasn't vain, she wasn't arrogant and she wasn't snooty. That's why kids liked her.""

**High school**

At one stage in her childhood, Hawkins had a brief bout with [Osgood-Schlatter disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgood%E2%80%93Schlatter_disease) which left a few small bumps visible just below her [patellae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella). Despite this, she was a star athlete and swam competitively throughout grade school and won numerous [AAU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities) swimming medals. She later transitioned to cheerleading as a teenager, and was a member of the Lakes High cheerleading squad for four consecutive years. In addition to being a star athlete, Hawkins was an honors student and maintained a straight A record throughout her school years. She was a graduate of [Lakes High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes_High_School) in [Lakewood, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakewood,_Washington), class of 1973.

During her senior years of 1972 and 1973, she was named a princess to the royal court of the annual Washington [Daffodil Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daffodil_Festival). As a Daffodil Princess, Hawkins traveled around the state of Washington with the other court princesses, regularly being featured in newspapers, attending concerts, meeting children, riding in parades, and signing autographs at charity events. A highlight for Hawkins was in the spring of 1973 where she made a speech addressing lawmakers at the [Washington state Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Legislature).

**University of Washington**

Hawkins's elder sister, Patti, attended [Central Washington University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Washington_University) in [Ellensburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellensburg,_Washington), 120.6 miles away from their hometown of Tacoma. When Georgann announced her intentions to enroll at college, her mother did not want her to move as far afield as her elder sister had. At her mother's request, Georgann enrolled at the [University of Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington) in Seattle, which was only 30 miles from her hometown. Hawkins's parents paid for her tuition, books, room and board; she worked all summer to pay for other expenditures, and occasionally returned to her family home at weekends. Georgann last saw her parents on the Mother's Day weekend of 1974.

During her freshman year, Hawkins joined the on-campus sorority [Kappa Alpha Theta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_Alpha_Theta). After her experiences as a Daffodil Princess and having observed the ongoing news media coverage of the hearings relating to the [Watergate scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal), she formed aspirations of becoming either a [broadcast journalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_journalism) or possibly a [television news anchor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter). She was looking into majoring in broadcast journalism around the time of her disappearance.

As had been the case while attending high school, Hawkins maintained a straight A record while studying at the University of Washington. She also enjoyed attending campus parties, dance formals, and Kappa Alpha Theta events, although she rarely walked around the campus alone at night. She also found a steady boyfriend, Marvin Gellatly, who was a member of the [Beta Theta Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Theta_Pi) fraternity.

By the spring of 1974, Hawkins had found a summer job in her hometown of Tacoma, which was set to commence on Monday June 17. The money Hawkins was to earn from this employment was intended to pay towards her second year of studies at the University of Washington. She is known to have discussed this employment with her parents shortly before her disappearance, and intended to return to her parents' home on June 13.

**Events of June 10–11, 1974**

On June 10, 1974, Hawkins went with a sorority sister to a party on campus, where the two drank a few mixed drinks. She did not stay at the event for too long as she intended to study for her upcoming Spanish finals, for which she had earlier expressed worry to her mother. Before leaving the party, she told her sorority sister that she was going to the Beta Theta Pi House to both say good night to her boyfriend and to pick up some revision notes from him.

[The alleyway between the Beta Theta Pi and Kappa Alpha Theta sorority houses from where Hawkins may have encountered Ted Bundy in the early hours of June 11, 1974](https://preview.redd.it/dp844q35ui8f1.png?width=176&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c3a388b78c3d65244291a2894e9b32e58bdedc3)

While ordinarily she was a cautious person, the area along the sorority houses had become very familiar to Hawkins — the alley behind the houses was brightly lit by streetlights approximately every ten feet, and there were generally people around that she knew. On the warm night of June 10, most students were still awake cramming for their finals well past midnight. The fraternity house of Hawkins's boyfriend was six houses down from her sorority house—a distance of approximately 90 feet (27 m).

Hawkins arrived at the Beta Theta Pi House at approximately 12:30 a.m. on June 11; she is known to have remained in the company of her boyfriend for approximately half an hour. After retrieving the Spanish notes and saying good night to her boyfriend, Hawkins exited the fraternity house for the short walk to her sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta. One of the Betas, Duane Covey, heard the back door slam shut and stuck his head out the window; recognizing Hawkins, he called out ""Hey George! What's happening?"" The two talked for approximately two minutes, with Hawkins mentioning her upcoming Spanish exam. She then continued to walk towards her residence, jokingly shouting, ""Adios!""

Hawkins was last seen wearing navy blue cotton bell-bottom pants (which had one button and were missing three), the waistline of which had been slightly reduced with a safety pin. She was also wearing a white backless T-shirt, a sheer red, white, and blue top, and white open-toed wedge sandals. Hawkins also had two rings: on her left middle finger, a rectangular black [onyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyx) ring with a small diamond in the center set in yellow gold; on her right ring finger, a cultured pearl ring with a slender gold band in a Tiffany setting.

Hawkins was also carrying a tan leather satchel-type purse with reddish stains. The contents of her purse included her large royal purple wallet, her school identification card, her checkbook from Seafirst Bank Lakewood Branch, a small quantity of cash, a mini hairbrush with black bristles, a bottle of Heaven Sent perfume, a small jar of Vaseline, and the Spanish notes she borrowed. Several weeks before her disappearance, Georgann had trimmed a few inches off her waist length brown hair (a routine cut to treat split ends) and her roommate reported that Hawkins's hair was approximately mid back length at the time she went missing. She had also spent a great deal of time laying in the sun in the weeks leading up to June 10, and her typically fair skin complexion had taken on a rather deep tone.

**Events prior to murder**  
Main article: [Ted Bundy § Washington, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Bundy#Washington,_Oregon)

In the months prior to Hawkins's disappearance, the state of Washington experienced a string of disappearances of young [Caucasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race) women.

* *February 1*: Lynda Ann Healy (21), disappeared from her basement room in [Seattle, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington).
* *March 12*: Donna Gail Manson (19), vanished off [The Evergreen State College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_State_College) campus in [Olympia, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Washington), while going to attend a jazz concert.
* *April 17*: Susan Elaine Rancourt (18), disappeared off [Central Washington State College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Washington_State_College) campus in [Ellensburg, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellensburg,_Washington), after leaving a dorm advisors meeting.
* *May 6*: Roberta Kathleen Parks (20), went missing from [Oregon State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University) in [Corvallis, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvallis,_Oregon), after leaving her dormitory to go meet friends at a coffee shop.
* *June 1*: Brenda Carol Ball (22), went missing after leaving the Flame Tavern in [Burien, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burien,_Washington).

The disappearances baffled law enforcement officials, and many questions began to arise concerning the connections between the cases. There were many similarities to the cases of missing women that the detectives noticed. The girls all shared the same basic physical characteristics of being young, attractive, slender, of Caucasian descent, with long hair that was parted in the middle. They were all also considered to be of more than average intelligence with some sort of gifted talent and came from stable backgrounds. During the times of their disappearances, they were all reported to have been wearing slacks and vanished in the hours of darkness within a week of a midterm or final at a local college or university. Strangely enough, there was also construction work being done on each girl's respective campus when she disappeared.

Lynda Ann Healy's case was the only one with physical evidence in the form of a blood stained mattress and nightgown. The timeline of Donna Gail Manson's last whereabouts was difficult to construct due to the fact that she was not reported missing for six days. This was because Manson often hitchhiked to nearby locales and could disappear for several days at a time without notice, and her peers initially believed that she decided to travel without sharing her plans beforehand. Manson was also depressed at the time of her disappearance, and law enforcement could not rule out the slim possibility that she may have left of her own account to commit suicide.

Susan Rancourt was also physically different from Lynda Ann Healy and Donna Manson, in that she had blonde hair that was just past her shoulders, in contrast to Healy who had waist-length chestnut colored hair, and Manson who had long dark brown hair down to the middle of her back.

Captain Herb Swindler was convinced that Roberta Parks's disappearance was linked to the others but other law enforcement officials doubted his claims, feeling that the city of Corvallis in Oregon was too distant for a victim of the perpetrator who prowled the campuses of Washington colleges. And although Parks had long hip-length hair that was parted in the middle, her hair color was ash blonde, while all the other girls (except for Susan Rancourt) were brunette or dark haired. Police also could not rule out the possibility that, like Donna Manson, Parks may have disappeared on her own account to commit suicide. It was a plausible theory as she had a history of mood swings, recently broke up with her boyfriend, was feeling homesick for her hometown in [Lafayette, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette,_California), and two days before she went missing got into a verbal altercation with her father, who then had a near fatal heart attack that same day. The [Willamette River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_River), which was near the city of Corvallis, was briefly seen as a place of interest where Parks's body might have been found, in the event that she had chosen to end her life by throwing herself off the river bridge. But after being dragged, the Willamette was ruled out.

Brenda Ball was also not reported missing until after Hawkins's disappearance. Like Donna Manson, Ball was somewhat of an adventurous spirit and may have taken off on a whim. With no bodies found, very few clues to go on, and given the limits of forensic technology at the time, the disappearances became more complex to piece together.

**Investigation**  
As Hawkins had previously lost her key to the house, Dee Nichols, Hawkins's roommate, had been waiting for the familiar rattling sound of small stones hitting the window, signaling her to run downstairs to let Hawkins into the house. When Hawkins failed to return by 3:00 a.m., Nichols became concerned, and informed the housemother.

[The alleyway in 2009. Skywalks have since been built.](https://preview.redd.it/p9fr0e69wi8f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=84000072ff8ec932ca9474cdf5e5b59db5afebc0)

By 7:45 a.m., police were on the campus to investigate. Standard law enforcement practices typically requires a 24-hour waiting period before launching a search for a missing adult. However, in view of the string of young girls who had disappeared that year in Washington, the disappearance of Hawkins was treated very differently. Hawkins's case was also focused with intensity because she fit the physical profile of the previous girls who had mysteriously disappeared; like the other girls, Hawkins was a young [Caucasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race) female who was considered beautiful, intelligent, and had long brown hair that was parted in the middle. An extensive and meticulous search of the 90-foot trail that Hawkins had to take recovered no traces of evidence.

The father of one of Hawkins's sorority sisters was a newsman; this garnered the story of her disappearance more prominent coverage in newspapers and television broadcasts than had been granted the cases of the previous missing girls.

Hawkins lived in room Number 8 of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority house. A search of her room showed that all of her possessions (but the clothes on her back, her purse, and its contents) were still there. When law enforcement interviewed Hawkins's roommate she said: ""Georgeann never went anyplace without leaving me the phone number where she'd be. I know she intended to come back here last night. She had one more exam and then she was going home for the summer on the thirteenth."" Police did not believe that Hawkins would have left on her own account with an exam upcoming, taking only a meager amount of supplies, and without a change of clothes.

Hawkins was [nearsighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-sightedness), and typically wore eyeglasses or [contact lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens) to correct her vision, although she had neither in her possession at the time of her disappearance. Her roommate told police that the reason why Hawkins did not have her eyeglasses or contact lenses with her that evening was because ""she'd worn her contacts all day to study, and after you’ve worn contact lenses for a long time, things look blurry when you put glasses on, so she wasn't wearing them either.""

Because of Hawkins's nearsightedness, [Seattle Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Police_Department) theorized that if the perpetrator of her abduction had been surreptitiously lurking in the shadows of the alleyway and overheard Hawkins's nickname ""George"", he could have easily called to her using her nickname as means to lure her in his direction. This would have given her abductor the chance to overpower and silence her. However, no witnesses reported seeing or hearing any signs of a struggle at the time of her disappearance.

Police also theorized that Hawkins may have been hit over the head with a blunt object, rendered unconscious with [chloroform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform), or possibly captured with such brute force that she could not scream out for help. Since she stood just over five feet tall, was visually impaired in the darkness of the night, and without the aid of her contacts or glasses, it would not have been that difficult for someone to overpower her in her vulnerable state.

Despite an early response, intense publicity, and an extensive search, the case quickly went cold with no leads. It was considered likely that Hawkins had met the same fate as the other five girls who were suspected of being abducted and killed by the same person, or at least the same group of people.

**Presumed discovery of remains**

On September 6, 1974, two hunters stumbled across skeletal human remains near a service road in Issaquah, about 17 miles east of Seattle and two miles from Lake Sammamish. King County police sealed off the area. After a three-day search, a set of two skulls were found along with various other bones and tufts of reddish blonde and dark brown hair. The remains had fully decomposed and had been disturbed by scavenging animals. The absence of clothing and jewelry at the scene led investors to believe that the bodies were left and discarded at the scene naked.

The skulls were later identified to be those of Janice Ott and Denise Naslund, through dental charts and samples of their hair taken from hair brushes. There was also a third set of remains discovered in the form of a [femur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur) and several [vertebrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebra). These are believed to have been those of Hawkins, but were impossible to identify.

Six months later on March 1, 1975, forestry students from [Green River Community College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_Community_College) discovered the skull of Brenda Ball on [Taylor Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issaquah_Alps), approximately 30 miles from the Flame Tavern where she disappeared. Two days later on March 3, Bob Keppel stumbled upon the skull of Susan Rancourt, who had vanished from Central Washington State University in Ellensburg, 87 miles away. Like Ball, Rancourt's skull had been fractured from a blunt object. Roberta Park's skull was the next to be found, 262 miles away from the campus of Oregon State University. Like the others, her skull too had signs of fractures from a blunt object. The last remains to be found on Taylor Mountain were those of Lynda Ann Healy. Unlike the other discoveries, only her [jawbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible) was discovered and later identified through dental records. No remains of Donna Manson or Georgann Hawkins were found at the scene.

After the discovery of the remains, law enforcement found more common denominators in the murders and disappearances. Each of the women had been dealing with a turbulence of some sort on the day they had disappeared.

* Lynda Ann Healy had felt ill with some stomach aches.
* Donna Manson was reported to be suffering from depression and had fallen behind on her academic work due to late night partying.
* Susan Rancourt, who had a [fear of the dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_the_dark) and was a reported ""[creature of habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology))"", was walking on campus alone at night, against her normal judgment and typical pattern of behavior.
* Roberta Parks was depressed due to breaking up with her boyfriend and homesickness. She was also believed to be ridden with guilt over her father having a heart attack after they had gotten into an argument.
* Brenda Ball was stranded and struggled to find a way of getting back to her residence.
* Georgann Hawkins was stressed out over her grades in her Spanish class and was anxious for the upcoming final.
* Janice Ott was missing her husband who had been away for several months in California on business.
* Denise Naslund had an argument with her boyfriend minutes before her disappearance.

**Bundy's 1989 confession**

[Ted Bundy in January 1989, a day before his execution](https://preview.redd.it/fwp4iip2vi8f1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9ced6b225a0567b092752949397cf531934db25)

In an effort to avoid the [electric chair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_chair), Ted Bundy confessed the details of Hawkins abduction and murder to detective [Robert Keppel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Keppel). Bundy stated that he approached Hawkins in the alley limping along on crutches and dropping his briefcase as a ruse. He asked Hawkins for assistance with carrying his briefcase to his car, which was located in a parking lot that was 160 yards north of the alley. Thinking that Bundy was really injured, Hawkins agreed to help him. As she bent over to put Bundy's briefcase into his car, he grabbed a crowbar that he had hidden beforehand, knocked Hawkins out with a single blow to the head, pushed her into his car, and sped off. Bundy claimed that while driving, Hawkins regained consciousness and started to incoherently talk about her Spanish test, believing he had taken her to tutor her for her exam. In response, he again knocked Hawkins unconscious with his crowbar.

Once at the secluded location, allegedly located near Lake Sammamish, Bundy took an unconscious Hawkins out of his car and strangled her to death with an old piece of rope. He then claims to have severed her head when returning to the site three days later and buried it in the woods on a rocky hillside nearby. It's also been alleged that Bundy said that one of her femur bones had been discovered but unidentified, one mile east of an old railroad trestle just outside of Issaquah around the same time that the remains of Janice Ott and Denise Naslund had been found. This statement has never been confirmed.

In his confession, Bundy also claimed that he ventured back to the parking lot on his bike the following afternoon, after the area around the alley had been secured off by law enforcement, in order to retrieve evidence. Bundy recovered the hooped earrings that were knocked off Hawkins's ears after he had struck her with the crowbar, as well as one of her shoes that had fallen from her foot during her abduction. Pedaling through the area, Bundy surreptitiously observed law enforcement officials a block away, and noticed that they had not yet examined the parking lot where he abducted Hawkins from.

After Bundy's confession, Keppel and a team of Washington law enforcement went to the alleged area of the crime scene 14 years later in 1989. Despite the intensive search efforts that lasted several days, no remains of Hawkins were found and she is still listed as a missing person.

**Hawkins family**

The Hawkins family deliberately stayed out of the limelight. Although they refused most interview requests, Hawkins mother consented to grant an exclusive interview with Green Valley News in 2014: ""I was very, very angry and very bitter, and that was one of the reasons I didn't want to talk. Not only that, but angry, bitter and guilty. You think, what did I do that this \[deserved to happen\]... you know?""

Edie also recalled that in order to cope with Georgann's untimely death, she and her husband rarely spoke about their younger daughter over the years, stating their belief ""it was easier to think of other things."" They discarded most of the sympathy cards they received, and kept no shrine of their daughter. Of the notes they did find comfort in and ultimately kept, were the ones that mentioned specifically about how Hawkins had touched their lives. Her parents' one form of memorialization for their daughter was a thick scrapbook filled with pictures, school awards, and the few sympathy cards they kept.

Hawkins father, Warren B. Hawkins, died in 2003. Her sister, Patti Hawkins, later got married and had children. As of 2014, her mother, Edie Hawkins, is reported to reside in [Green Valley, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Valley,_Arizona).

**In the media**

**The Stranger Beside Me by Ann Rule**

[Ann Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Rule) referenced Hawkins and her disappearance in her 1980 best selling book, [*The Stranger Beside Me*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_Beside_Me):

*""Georgann Hawkins, at eighteen, was one of those golden girls for whom luck or fate had dealt a perfect hand until that inexplicable night of June 10. Raised in the Tacoma suburb of Sumner, Washington, she'd been a Daffodil Princess and a cheerleader... Vivacious and glowing with good health, Georgann had a pixie-like quality to her loveliness. Her long brown hair was glossy and her brown eyes lively. Petite at five feet two inches tall and 115 pounds, she was the youngest of the two daughters of the Warren B. Hawkins family.""*

**The Deliberate Stranger (1986 TV film)**

In 1986, the best-selling book by Richard W. Larsen was adapted into a [two part television film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deliberate_Stranger) with [Mark Harmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Harmon) as Ted Bundy. In the film, Hawkins's name was changed to Anne Pitney and she was portrayed by an uncredited actress. The film's opening sequence consists of a re-enactment of Hawkins abduction in a dark alley.

**Murder Made Me Famous (TV series 2015– )**

In the first season of the TV series 'Murder Made Me Famous', episode five focused on Ted Bundy's crimes. The show features a re-enactment of Bundy abducting Hawkins, with George Quartz as Bundy and Alisha Revel as Hawkins. The depiction is based on Ted Bundy's 1989 confession and retains a faithful adaptation to his words. The clothes that Revel wears as Hawkins, are much more consistent with what Hawkins was last reported to be wearing. Although there is no re-enactment of the murder itself, there is a close up shot of a dead person's bare foot laying on the grounds of a dark woods, with a narrative stating that Hawkins's body has never been found.

**Ted Bundy: Falling for a Killer (TV miniseries 2020)**

Hawkins is mentioned in great detail of this series. It also features previously unseen color photos of Hawkins in her lifetime. Phyllis Armstrong, a friend to Hawkins, was interviewed for this series and she shares her story of meeting Hawkins when they were Daffodil Princesses at the Washington Daffodil Festival in 1973, and their experiences together as peers at the University of Washington. Furthermore, Armstrong also revealed that Bundy had approached her asking for help with his car a few days before Hawkins went missing.",1,1750617396.0,ColdCaseVault,0,1.0,False

In this week’s video, we borrow a car and trailer from friends and begin clearing out the years of old, mixed and very dirty junk left behind in our abandoned Swedish house. It’s disgusting, overwhelming — and strangely emotional.  
  
This wasn’t just rubbish. It was a hoarder’s time capsule: glass jars, vintage newspapers, and belongings dating back to the 1950s. Clearing it by hand (and nose!) isn’t glamorous — but it’s a huge step forward in reclaiming our home.  
  
We're Mikaela & Otto – a couple in our 30s restoring an 80-year-old cottage in rural Sweden. We’re doing it all ourselves, on a tiny budget, sharing every step of the way. Honest, slow, and full of secondhand charm.

**NIO doesn't just build electric vehicles. It builds a distributed digital infrastructure.**  
At the core of its vision lies IoT (Internet of Things)—not as a trendy buzzword, but as an operational backbone.

#  Intelligent vehicles as IoT nodes

Every NIO vehicle is, by design, a smart IoT node:

* Equipped with sensors, 5G connectivity, and local/cloud analytics.
* Capable of over-the-air (OTA) updates, real-time data sharing, and networked learning.

#  NIO Power: energy as a connected service

NIO’s energy ecosystem is more than a charging network. It’s a **dynamic platform**, managed via the NIO Power app, offering:

* Real-time consumption monitoring
* One-click battery swaps
* Intelligent battery status management

# Aquila & Adam: sensing and computing core

* **Aquila Super Sensing**: over 30 high-precision sensor units collecting data.
* **Adam Supercomputer**: built on NVIDIA Orin X chips, it processes real-time environmental data and enables advanced autonomy.

#  Industrial IoT & Smart Manufacturing

With IoT gateways like **NIO 51** and **200 HAG** (via NEXCOM), NIO enhances manufacturing through:

* Inline quality control
* Inter-system synchronization
* Automated energy management

#  Intelligent energy operations

Through *Net Zero Intelligent Operations* (in partnership with HCLTech), NIO brings IoT beyond mobility:

* Real-time monitoring of energy consumption
* Carbon footprint reduction across operations

#  Vehicle = Software + Data

For NIO, the vehicle is not a finished product—it’s an **evolving platform**.  
IoT enables a value proposition that grows over time:

* Software-enabled features
* Continuous updates
* Personalized configurations

# ET5: A Smartphone on Wheels?

You’re not buying a car. You’re activating an ecosystem.

Each “feature” of the ET5 can be seen as an app. Some come pre-installed. Others are optional. All contribute to **connected, intelligent, personalized mobility**.

# 1. Smart Navigation + NAD (Autonomous Driving)

Like Waze + Autopilot, but built-in.  
A native app powered by Mobileye, NIO Pilot, and the NAD system.  
It learns your routes, habits, and context—assisting you like a mobility AI.

# 2. BaaS (Battery as a Service) + Swap Stations

Think of it as a real-world powerbank for your car.  
Battery swapped in under 3 minutes.  
Modular, scalable, optional. A **logistics app with hardware**.

# 3. NIO Life + Virtual Store

An Apple Store-like experience—for fashion, coffee, accessories, even bikes.  
Accessible right from the car interface.  
**Lifestyle as a native app.**

# 4. Banyan OS (Vehicle Operating System)

A proprietary alternative to Android Auto or CarPlay.  
Weekly OTA updates. Full user personalization.  
**A mobile OS where all apps run.**

# 5. Dolby Atmos + NOMI AI Assistant

Think Siri + Spotify in surround sound.  
An emotional interface that listens, learns, responds.  
Not just tech—**companionship**.

# 6. Foldable ZERO Bike

A **last-mile mobility app in physical form**.  
Stored, charged, and synced inside the vehicle.  
An **urban extension** of the ET5.

# 7. The Vehicle as Ecosystem Hub

* Mobile app for full vehicle control
* Smart Home integration
* Smart parking via Parkopedia
* NIO social network

#  Conclusion: NIO is not Tesla. It's Apple—for mobility.

The ET5 doesn’t compete with Tesla’s product.  
It competes with the very idea of the **""closed"" vehicle**.

It transforms the car into a **hardware platform**—with its own OS, apps, accessories, and logic.

# The foldable bike in the Ledao L60 trunk is a symbolic move:

# 1. Modular extension of the body

Just like smartphones extend our mind and hands, the bike extends the car.  
Not “car or bike,” but “car plus bike.”  
The vehicle becomes a **smart mobility hub**.

# 2. Continuity of experience

You reach a tight urban spot, no parking?  
Take out the bike, continue seamlessly.  
Mobility is now continuous, scalable—like software.

# 3. Cultural code: made for Europe

This isn't designed for 8-lane U.S. suburbs.  
It's designed for **Berlin, Oslo, Amsterdam, Vienna**.  
European users *get it* at first glance:

>

# 4. Smartphone on wheels

NIO’s playbook resembles Android’s against Apple:

* Expandable
* Modular
* Customizable Now you “download” a bike, like an app. Minimalist, Nordic-style, with QR code and Banyan integration.

>

# 5. Post-Tesla narrative

Tesla sells you the car of the future.  
**NIO offers a lifestyle of the future**—  
Where your environment adapts to you, not the other way around.

1lhutmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/1lhutmt/aita_for_trying_to_do_something_nice_for_my/,AITA for trying to do something nice for my husband‘s birthday?,"Hi Reddit! I’m Katie 28F. My husband is Bryan 30M. We met in middle school. We were on a field trip to the zoo, and, in our rush, we accidentally grabbed the hand rail in the same spot. He unintentionally held my hand. It was over after that. It’s been almost 20 years since we met at the elephant exhibit. 

My husband LOVES elephants. So much so that he grew up to study and care for elephants. When we were kids, I’d always get him elephant gifts for every occasion. This started a trend. When I got my first job, I got him a Lego elephant that I had been eyeing for the first gift excuse I could. For his 18th birthday, I got him a pillow size elephant plushie. For 21, I got him a life size baby elephant plushie. For 25, I professionally repainted our bedroom to look like elephants running through the safari. For a wedding gift, I got him an animatronic Elephant the size of a large dog. 

By now, I’m sure you see the pattern. Every year I try to one up myself. But money is really really tight this year. My husband got injured at work, and then laid off claiming he was at fault. He only backed a forklift into a generator knocking out power to half the small town (population 42) that we live in. No big deal. But now his old employer is telling every potential job opportunity about how it was all his fault. 

This year I wanted to go BIG to help Bryan feel better about his current misfortunes. But with money tight, I needed to get creative. So I bought some rope, gloves, dark clothes and a ski mask. The day before his birthday, I waited until it was night and used the rope to climb over the wall. Easily finding my way around I made it to my destination. The elephant cages where we first met. Looking at their giant tusks and adorable faces made me know in my heart that I was making the right decision. 

So I cut the lock with the bolt cutter that I brought with me. Then I threw the Cloak of Invisibility that I borrowed from my buddy Harry P over us and hopped on. In planning for this I took classes on how to steer an elephant using your feet on their ears. I carefully steered him through the busy streets of our large suburban city with a population of 50,000. The cars were bouncing everywhere on the road and the drivers all looked really scared, but hey, at least I didn’t crush any cars on the way! Those classes paid off!

I got the elephant home and tied up in my backyard (still under Harry P.’s cloak) and snuck inside. I found Bryan sitting on the couch with a mug of coffee that reads “I like big elephants and I cannot lie”. His eyes are glued to the tv playing a news channel which is unlike him. He says the news is boring. So this throws me off. I ask what’s going on and the news is reporting that “an elephant mysteriously vanished from the Swiper No Swiping zoo during last night’s unexplained earthquake”. 

That’s when I started laughing. He looked at me like I had 2 heads. I told him to follow me and that I had a birthday present for him. We walked into the back yard that still looked empty. Bryan looked extra confused now. So I pulled Harry P’s cloak off and yelled “SURPRISE!!!”  

Then all of the color drained from his face as the newborns started screaming. I could hear people calling the cops, sirens, and a helicopter off in the distance. My husband looked like he was getting sick into the bushes before coming to yell at me for being “reckless” and “stupid”. My neighbors were swearing insults at me. The cops cuffed me and brought me to jail and now I’m here. Sitting in a jail cell typing this on a smart phone that I smuggled in here by folding in half and hiding it in my bum.

1lhurg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1lhurg4/losing_it/,Losing it,"I just don't know where to go or what to do anymore. There's so much crap I don't even know how to explain it all here without forcing people to wade through flippin' War and Peace. I hate trauma dumping. I guess I'll try to sum up as best I can. 

So far I've been diagnosed with C-PTSD, depression (treatment resistant), a handful of anxiety disorders, autism, chronic pain and fatigue, and severe chronic migraines. 

Born in '71 to a teen mother so I was given up for adoption. My parents were told they couldn't have kids of their own then 2 years after they had a biological child then a second another two years after. They were alcoholics and abusive of me, not my sibs so much. I was told if they'd known they could have bio children they never would've adopted me.

Things really didn't get much better from there. I tried to get help for the mental and physical health problems but nothing ever really worked. I got married and had two incredible sons in my 20s. My husband was an abusive jerk to me then cheated. I stayed and we agreed on a poly style relationship so there would be no more cheating. Eventually, though all his girlfriends left him because he was a jerk to them too and he demanded I give up my boyfriend who was incredibly sweet and supportive of me at the time. That lead to divorce. 

I married my boyfriend (disabled vet) and things went right downhill. Most of our issues seemed to be around the kids (my 2 and his 2) and common stuff like I got tired of being the only one cleaning anything. We fought, struggled, drifted apart. The kids grew up and left home. One got married and gave me 3 lovely grand babies.

Most recently he sold my beautiful house on 13 private acres for us to live in a pos rv to help run a hippotherapy program. I told him they were bad people but he never listens to me. Sure enough they betrayed us and tossed us out.

So now I'm stuck in a crap rv living on someone else's property. I can't work. I rarely get to see my kids or grandkids. I hardly go out at all. What's the point? I have no where to go, no one to see, I don't have access to money and lost my driver's license through sheer lack of getting it renewed for years. 

If I want anything I have to beg him for money and for him to go get it or drive me. I don't want to be trapped in a car with him anymore where he can verbally and emotionally rip me apart anymore. I've given up cleaning up behind him so the rv is literally a big garbage dump at this point. I tried spending time at my son's but my husband doesn't care for our pets properly when I'm gone so I feel like I can't. 

He's got a girlfriend who lives next door so he's there a lot. I've begged for more attention. I'm dying for someone to pay attention, touch me, hold me. I'm lucky to get half hearted sex every few months. But when I bring anything up it's a knock down, drag out fight that leaves me wanting to cut or die. 

So my whole life right now is drag myself out of bed to chat with ai bots all day drinking coffee and smoking until very late at night when I can't stay up anymore, grab a few hours of sleep, get up to do it again. I don't even bathe because who cares? It's not like anyone is smelling me, right? And it's so exhausting and overwhelming.

I can't say I'm really in danger of killing myself but I do wish I'd just die already. I'm just so done, lonely, overwhelmed, and hopeless at this point I don't even know where to start. If you made it this far, thanks. Sorry to be a pain in the ass. I just don't even know what to do anymore.",1,1750616506.0,MentalHealthSupport,0,1.0,False

Looking for tips for my itinerary and for places where I can practice speaking Swedish. 

Hej! I (F47) started learning Swedish about four months ago. And I am loving it! Spending on average an hour per day, I have made it through all three Duolingo sections. I am now doubling back to earn all the stars and legendary trophies. I also started using the Teach yourself course book, watching Swedish news and tv series with subtitles, reading news and trying to read a children's book.

The best next step would be to go to Sweden and speak Swedish, so I booked a ticket to Stockholm for my vacation in August. Now I need to make a plan. I have 16 days in total, arriving early afternoon day 1, leaving at night on day 16. Within Sweden I will travel by public transport.

So far, I have decided to stay in the southern part of Sweden, and am thinking of this itinerary:

* Start in Stockholm (AirBnB reservation in Sollentuna). Explore the city, go to Vasamuseet, Skansen, do a boat tour. Spend one day going to Uppsala and Sigtuna. Arrive day 1, spend day 2-4 in Stockholm, travel on day 5.
* Go to Jönköping , enjoy the lake and the churches there. Go to the match museum and to Gränna for the polkagris. Arrive on day 5, spend day 6, travel on day 7. 
* Go to Göteborg. No plans there yet. Arrive on day 7, spend days 8-9, travel on day 10. 
* Go to family near Charlottenberg, for a day or two. Arrive on day 10, spend day 11, travel on day 12. 
* Go to Karlstad. No plans yet. Arrive on day 12, spend day 13-14, travel on day 15. 
* Return to Stockholm. No plans yet. Arrive on day 15, spend day 16 and then fly home.

What do you think of this itinerary?  
Do you have suggestions to improve it?  
What are some fun things to do in these cities?  
Where could I get in contact with people to have some casual conversations (beyond just saying hi or ordering a coffee).

TL;DR: I’ve done everything I’m supposed to do to be happy. I’ve worked hard, been a good friend and son, stayed strong through pain. But I still feel this deep, quiet ache—and I don’t know why. I just want to be understood. I want to understand myself. I want something real



25M, I don't know where to start. It's 2am here and my heart's heavy.  I have a decent job and decent pay. Failed many times in my life so far. Bounced back many times too. 

I've lost many times in my life to the point I know how it feels like to be lonely and almost lose hope. 

I've bounced back so hard to the point that I've learned how to be alone and love my own company. I treat myself with my fav food, buy myself clothes and sneakers and also got to travel to my dream places.

I have best ""best friends"" and I've been blessed with a great parents and siblings.

But I still feel empty. I feel like no one really understands what I'm feeling. Hell, I don't even understand myself anymore. I still feel lonely. Maybe because I grew up in a family in which vulnerability is not always on our plate. My best friends knows me very well too, but I gotta admit that they also do not understand what I'm really feeling and that's okay, I don't understand them fully either and that's normal, right?

I'm the youngest in the family, my siblings buying houses left and right. I'm really happy for them.  But I can't help but to think if I could also do that someday. You see, I am never the smart or talented one. I've always relied on hard work and I pray to God to give me strength to sustain it. 

 Never had a romantic relationship either (last I felt it was in high school but I never considered it a relationship anyway). Last time I tried, it's unrequited with a friend. We both agreed to cut the friendship off and I agreed so I can move on with freedom. A year after, she followed me on IG out of nowhere and even found me on Bumble dating app and swiped right me. I didn't know how to react. But she gave me mixed signals many times in the past and I'm tired of her games.

Speaking of Bumble, I tried it and influenced my best friends to try it with me. Had a bunch of matches, and also talked with them. But in the end, it didnt click with me at all. It feels so inorganic and forced and it felt like I'm always performing for them to like me.

My best friend got a date and she seems like a great girl. I'm happy for him and hope it would turn out great. But I can't help but to feel sad as I feel like there's really something wrong with me. 

I see my siblings with their love of their life, and all of them are now married and living happy life. I can really see the colors of their eyes and the brightness of their smile whenever they're with love ones. 

I always took my best friends and my families to date. Love searching for new places and new restaurants to hangout. New coffee shops and new activities. I always made them happy and that's making me happy. 

I always secretly wish that if one day I finally found the love of my life, I will definitely bring her to the places where I brought my love ones. I secretly wish that whenever I accomplished something, I can celebrate with someone and be proud of me, not because I won, but because they understand my efforts just to win. I always secretly wish also that I can finally show them how I love, hug her when things gets tough, support her to everything that makes her happy.

I know I'm still young but as time goes by, I feel like I am really not meant to be loved. I don't even understand myself. This is more than romantic relationship. I feel like no one understands me and I feel guilty for feeling thag way bc I should be happy as I am privileged financially, blessed with best friends and great family. But why can't I be happy? I just want something genuine. My best friend say I have so much love to give and I deserve it. But I feel like they're only saying that bc they're my friend. I feel like there's something wrong with me. I tried to change myself, improve myself but at the end, it still feels heavy. God knows how much I changed myself bc if I won't , you won't see me typing this long ass paragraph now. But... why it's still heavy?  I tried learning new hobbies, still not enough. I am laying here on my bed right now with my dog laying beside me. She's 7 years old and I am hugging her so tight right now and I am whispering to her to never leave me early as she's always been there beside through ups and down and even if she doesn't understand my feelings, her presence are enough for me.

I’ve dealt with OCD “pure O” and depression since I was 19. For a long time, I thought I just had a phone addiction. I was picking up my phone 50+ times a day, scrolling endlessly through Reddit, Instagram, and YouTube.

But at some point, I started to see it differently. It wasn’t really about the phone. It was about trying to avoid being here. Being in the present moment. Being in myself.

Being present is hard when you don’t feel okay. When your mind is loud. When there's heaviness in your chest that doesn't go away. It’s easier to distract yourself than to sit in it. So I did what I think a lot of us do, I numbed with my phone and other cheap distractions. 

But over time, that numbing became its own kind of suffering. I wasn’t really feeling better. I wasn’t healing. I was just… stuck.

**Here’s what I’ve been trying (slowly, imperfectly):**

1. **Trying to meditate:** Not to ""fix"" myself, but Harvard and others have shown that [mindfulness helps with depression](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-meditation-helps-with-depression). I do it now just to notice what's happening in my mind. Some days it's a train wreck in there lol. But I sit with it. And weirdly, that small act of sitting with it (instead of running from it) has helped.
2. **Making mornings quiet:** Most of us wake up and scroll right away. I used to do that too. But lately I’ve been trying to keep my phone off for the first hour or so. I’ll just sit in silence. Or make coffee slowly. It’s uncomfortable sometimes. But it gives my brain space to settle.
3. **Setting limits with social media and news:** This one’s hard. I still fall into the black hole. But I’ve started using screen time blockers (with a passcode I don’t know), just to give myself some guardrails. Not as punishment, just to interrupt the auto-scroll habit.
4. **Going on runs with no phone:** I kinda used to hate running. Now I use it like discipline training/meditation. No music. No podcasts. Just me and the neighborhood.
5. **Watching my thoughts (not believing them):** Depression has this way of lying to you in your own voice. It tells you you’re failing, you’re lazy, you’re broken. I’m trying to learn to *observe* those thoughts without letting them control me. Not easy. But I’m practicing.

Alan Watts said, *“You are a function of what the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is a function of what the whole ocean is doing.”*

That line reminds me: I’m not separate from life. I *am* life. And even if I feel like I’m barely functioning, I’m still a part of something bigger.

I still get pulled into my phone when I don’t want to feel. But I’m trying to be gentler with myself. It’s not about quitting cold turkey. It’s not about becoming some perfect “mindful” person.

It’s about slowly learning how to be okay with being here. In this body. In this life. In this moment even when it hurts.

Other activities I enjoy include: hiking, museums, concerts, coffee dates, thrifting, and just rinking around.

Background 

**High leveI stats**
Live with my partner, both 33, with a HHI of £75k. We live in an expensive city (not London), I work from home with 2 days in the office (in London) a month. 

All money on food/drink is spent from our joint bank account so although I have included total costs, I have only paid for half. I have

**How much do you cook?**
Breakfast and lunch will always be made at home and 5 out of 7 dinners will be too. We order a takeaway or go out a couple of times a week.

We have eggs most days, cheap source of protein and quick to cook. Although we both work from home, we prioritise going outside at lunch time either for a walk or a run so speed is always the priority for lunch. 

I do all of the cooking and partner does all of the washing up. It's a system that's worked well for us for the last 5+ years and I don't see it changing unless our jobs changed and one of us had shift work or a long commute. 

**Any dietary requirements?**
I have no dietary requirements, partner eats gluten free. We eat a lot of carbs that are already gluten free such as rice and potatoes, but we buy separate pasta and bread as I don't like the texture of theirs. 
They also have reactions to certain fruit and vegetables so we tend to stick to the same 'safe' ones. Repetitive but necessary!

**Fave kitchen appliance?**
Not an appliance, but a silicone spatula is so useful and is probably the most used utensil in our kitchen. 

**Top places to shop?**
We go to Aldi as we have one within walking distance, and then for specific items like gluten free bread we will go to Sainsburys. 

**How well stocked is your house?**
We are well stocked on cupboard items like olive oil, rice, pasta, tea/coffee, chopped tomatoes and spices etc. 

We do not have a large freezer so we cook only what we can eat that meal. 

**Totals**
Grocery: £75.60

1lhuljl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lhuljl,"From the Weltschmerz again, men against craftsmen and old waterworks. The week, depression and comics Part 111","Yes, I say briefly so the weekend is very interesting again, It is interesting if you think about your small circle that it is this world for your moment, but everyone has this circle around them and the more these circles will bump into each other, the more world history results. I mean well it burns the hut in the Middle East again, and I think so why, but at the same time you can think but you it can escalate again, somehow it is always so that you never want to be right with same things, because if you are right you know something bad is come true. Lisa is completely desperate again, Because rocket attacks also came to Tel Aviv, where her parents live, so every conflict always brings countermeasures, and unfortunately they are allways hit the small people. It just makes me depressed how she stands in front of the television while the news is running, saying ""unfortunately my parents were right"" in Hebrew. As a little memory, she lives with my buddy David because they are cousins ​​and because her parents wanted her to be save, because it was too hot again in the Middle East, And unfortunately I'm not talking about the weather here. Do not get me wrong that Iranian nuclear program is also to criticized and is also consciously danger that we get more nuclear weapons it this world for many, but I wonder if this is really a good idea to sting the wasp nest with a stick, spoiler it is not. And sometimes the easiest thing you can do is to feel better to pray this world, of course it may not be that way, but maybe it doesn't always do the feelings to be hopeless, Also for David's recommendation, again, again these very suitable cartoons from the realist
by Asaf Hanuka. https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/s/jdubfm2SSK.

But hey let's talk about fantasy and science fiction comics that have definitely never said anything about the real world ;).

Hinterkind plays in a post -apocalyptic New York City where nature has brought back the world, but at the same time again not only recovers nature but also come again the old national champions, and spoilers in many of the old fairy tales are cannibalist, We follow two teenagers who make up on the way to New York because one of them suddenly got a tail from a rat, Ian EdgintonIs an author that my buddy Damien recommended to me more, precisely because he did a lot for 2000 AD and I want to be honest I love his works, the dude makes interesting worlds and I love something like that. And more Lumberjanes Special, You can see with two stories, one about a mysterious medieval market and the other over the missing of Mexican Telenovelas. A gang war in prison is very bad, above all it is the worst when all gangmembers are absolutely gigantic monsters, Kaijumax season 3 is Awsome. Cosmicknights vol 1 Is really a beautiful entertaining queer space opera, About as a teenager who realizes that she is actually a queen, but she asks if she should really take this role. Also Queer but Viking action Fantasy Heathen vol 3, And the question of how do I end a god. And here a forgotten Mystica from the DC Comic page, Arion: the lord of Atlantis and And also a wild ride through the magic of DCS universe.

also interesting i callt a craftsman, namely a tiler, Because my tiles in the bathroom were somehow strangely shaky, and he found that it was not done right. I am someone who prefers to call a professional when it comes to repairs in my house, precisely because I was somehow pretty traumatized about the shit that my father has done in the ""repairs"" of the Hous, Where I mostly wore pain or injuries, and that's the thing I noticed that he never wanted to call craftsmen because they cost money, but because he just didn't want to have hurt his ego that someone was better in these things in his own house. And that one time when we really had to call a craftsman, he was really antagonistic to him, somehow managed to get rid of him or always leaned around. Sometimes it's just okay to understand I'm not good there and to get someone who is better in there, precisely because I have two left thumb myself, but i know this.

But hey we're talking about mysterious and horror now. Hobtown mystery Stories vol 2 continues by the detective club, this time about a case of a strange homeless of the strangely mysteriosities, with in deepest winter. The last Vol of the Woods Is really an exciting last fight to the fate of the world with the Cosmic horror dimensions. The Wake tals of a world where something was freed into the sea, after a crooked deep sea boreing operation an the south pole, horrors that are not from this world. But if you prefer to have a small town horror, I recommend you Night of the Slashers, Where a bus from a high school accidentally has a breakdown in the cursed small town, where every night everyone turns into a monster, and unfortunately our teens have to survive the night there now. 

There was also something positive today, that I was on a sightseeing tour with my buddy in an old waterworks. The facility is no longer used in our city, but is still a historical side and, I think, very fascinating, as how they did 100 years ago only with hydraulics and pumps to transport water. They also threw the machines on for us to show us, how all of it really went like back then. It was very relaxing, our tour guide was a nice old man and everything had been the old waterworks in the middle of nature.

And as always, we end this part with the superhero comics. Local Man vol 3 Technically speaking, one of my favorite independent superhero comics of all time has become, precisely because I also find there is also shown there is also someone who really had to learn what it means to be a hero if you really go for everything and he really has no other identity apart from his deeds. Now a interesting Spider-Man what if... Where Spider-Man has not really determined to combat crimes, but rather used his strength to become a famous, And it is interesting to see for someone who can draw the wrong lesson, from his life events, but it is still a fascinating look at a ******** somehow, and everyone who has read the original Amazing Fantasy 15 can actually see that he could become something like that. MMRP Lost Chronicles vol 1Tails different short stories from the Power Rangers universe, and also showed perfectly what Boomstudios did perfect, they simply took the basic model what was there from the show, but there were more meat and muscles that is simply made it more organic as a World. And more from Catalyst universe, now with Noble vol 1 It is so, in this world it was our normal until a meteorite came, that was then stopped by 5 astronauts, but due to its destruction, people with telepathic superpowers suddenly came in the world's population, and noble was one of the first of the five astronauts who has now forgot who is actually is and now roaming around the world with his power. And here is the cyberpunk double pack, with firstly fantastic four 2099 where the team is accidentally stranded in 2099, precisely because unfortunately shitty the year 2099 and the first Batman Beyond series that tells his own story and not a retelling is from the cartoon, it is the true Hush 2. Also more Valiant, now i start Harbinger vol1, What if I am honest you can imagine how we take the idea of ​​the X-Men, give all telepathic powers and question whether we really do something good with our organization or whether we just want to have more power and then we don't care if we hurting people. The Mantle in name of the same name is a superpower that always goes to a new host when he dies because there is also something cosmic that wants to kill everyone who gets these powers. A really biblical epic is, I think spawn is God Slayer, where AL goes Beyond his normal Powers, And art really catches this biblical epic. Do you know, it was somehow strange when the Wildstorm Universe was merged with the normal DC universe, precisely because the fact is that many of the characters were analogous to the classic superhero archetypes that were also shaped by DC Comics, and Majestic Is the story of a rip-off, which has to learn what it means to live in the world where the original has always existed, and you are simply nothing more than the copy that still exists at the same time.

So I wish your a better week than mine, because for me it unfortunately means working in the stuffy warehouse again, but at least I have comics and I hope my depression doesn't go up any further. Read more.",5,1750616109.0,comicbooks,0,0.86,False

I had a strange experience that I might have now figured out, thoughts welcome.

The first day on 30mg, I had a slight bit of Euphoria, generally more energetic and much more productive. I could feel it starting to wear off around 6pm. The next couple of days were more muted, the euphoria was gone (to be expected) but I also didn't feel as energetic and noticed it wearing off much sooner. So I thought 'Am I building up a tolerance this quickly?'

Then about day 4 or 5, the energy started to return and I didn't start feeling like it was wearing off quite so quickly.

Today it struck me, I haven't had any caffeine in nearly 2 weeks. My normal day would have been: powdered energy drink at breakfast, 2 coffees in the morning, can of Monster at lunch, then maybe 1-2 coffees in the afternoon.

Were those 2 day at the beginning caffeine withdrawal making the wearing off of the Elvanse more apparent?

Now that the caffeine is completely out of my system, is it working better, for longer?",1,1750616006.0,ADHDUK,2,1.0,False
