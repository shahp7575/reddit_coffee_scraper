I was pondering the different health benefits of beverages and thought it would be helpful to have an index to assess drinks. What inspired it was a post that said if drinking coke was a 10/10 on the unhealthy scale, a Diet Coke would be 1/10. So with that in mind, here’s what I’m thinking. 

Let’s make basic water from a safe tap as the baseline of 100. Anything worse is lower. Anything better is higher. A Zero would be like a poison that kills you instantly. Everything else is scaled off of how mucsh it could increase or decrease your health pan. Health span is a simple product of lifespan * quality of life. For example, drinking alcohol daily may score 80% lifespan compare to drinking water and 50% quality of life. Thus it would be 40 in the Beverage Efficacy Approximation Number (BEAN). Something like hydrolized water or green tea could increase quality or life span and score > 100. 

Obviously there will be lots of guessing, but hopefully there will be some consensus. 

Here’s a starter list if anyone wants to put in some index approximation.

The year we hated each other most,

Sebastian and I swore to make each other’s life a living hell.

He hated me for scheming my way into Vivienne’s place in the marriage pact with the Valentine Syndicate.

I hated him for marrying me with his heart still tied to another.

For five years, our marriage was a battleground—never once a true union.

Then came the shooting overseas.

He threw himself over me without hesitation, taking the bullets for me.

Blood poured from his mouth as he collapsed on top of me.

“Don’t read into it,” he whispered. “Just a Doctor’s instinct.”

“Helena… if there’s a next life, don’t choose me again. I never knew how to love you right…”

Then I opened my eyes— and it was the day of the engagement all over again.

This time, I went straight to my father.

“Sending an illegitimate daughter to the Valentine Syndicate might offend the wrong people. It has to be me.”

Sebastian Lowell, consider this my way of repaying your sacrifice.

I’ll marry into their world—and give you back your freedom.



“You’re volunteering to take Vivienne’s place in the marriage to the Valentine heir?”

My father’s cigar slipped from his fingers.

His shock wasn’t unwarranted.

I’d always hated Vivienne Whitmore with every fiber of my being.

The first time we met, I almost struck her with a riding crop.

Someone like me, stepping in to take her place in a foreign marriage alliance? Unthinkable.

He frowned. “Yesterday, you swore you’d only never marry anyone but Sebastian.”

I kept my voice calm. “I’m the rightful daughter of the Whitmore family. Sending an illegitimate child in my place might insult them. This is something only I can do.”

“As for Sebastian… let Vivienne have him.”

There was a flicker in his eyes—something between disbelief and reluctant pride.

“You’ve grown up. Well then… as you wish.”

He hadn’t changed—still the same hypocrite.

No matter how he masked it, Vivienne had always been his favorite.

If it weren't for me using the board of directors to pressure him in my past life, he would definitely have forcibly sent me out.

I turned to leave with a cold laugh, only to run into Sebastian in the hallway, dressed in a white sweater.

He was standing beneath the wall sconce, the amber light casting a soft glow across his sculpted features.

“So? Who’s headed to Castalia?”

He crossed the hallway quickly, urgency etched into his face.

I gave him a faint smile. “Who would you rather sent?”

Sebastian froze for a beat. His voice dropped low.

“All I know is, the Valentine Syndicate isn’t a family you cross lightly. They've been at odds with your family for years. There’s no way this marriage is in good faith.”

I looked him square in the eye. “But the alliance had been sealed for years. It is set in stone. No matter what, either Vivienne or I has to go. So who would you pick?”

He glanced toward the study, then scoffed.

“Doesn’t matter what I think, does it? The Whitmore princess gets final say. Neither Vivienne nor I ever had a choice.”

I brushed past him and climbed the stairs.

“Then keep your mouth shut if you don’t.”

Just as I expected—his heart was still with Vivienne.

But it didn’t matter.

Considering it a way of repaying my life-saving grace in my past life, I didn't intend to tell Sebastian Lowell that it was me who married off to Castalia.

So, on their wedding day, He would watch Vivienne Whitmore appear before him in her wedding dress.

Back then, Sebastian Lowell would have been pleasantly surprised, wouldn’t he?

Thinking back to the five years of torture we'd endured in our previous lives, I slowly let out a breath.

Sebastian Lowell—Fine. This time, I’ll give you what you want.

# Chapter 2

I spent the entire night weighing the risks of the Valentine Syndicate.

They weren’t exactly upstanding members of society. Andreas Valentine, their heir, was said to be the next in line to lead the Syndicate.

No one knew his face. No one knew his age. For all I knew, I’d arrive in Castalia only to find out I was marrying some fifty-year-old crime lord.

In my past life, it was Vivienne who was offered to the Valentine family. She came back within two weeks—shaking, weeping, out of her mind.

As much as Richard Whitmore doted on his precious daughter, he didn’t dare offend the Syndicate. So he sent her back.

The second time, she didn’t make it. Andreas used her for target practice—she collapsed from an asthma attack and died on the spot.

That death carved itself into Sebastian’s heart—and gave him yet another reason to despise me.

But this time, I was the one being shipped off overseas.

I had to ready. At the very least, I needed to sharpen my aim.

The next morning, I went straight to the shooting range.

With my goggles on and earmuffs tight, I gripped the pistol and fired—round after round, for three straight hours.

It wasn’t until nearly noon that I finally hit a few bullseyes—and allowed myself a breath of relief.

That’s when a hand clamped down on my wrist.

The grip was so tight it felt like my bones might shatter.

“You hate your own sister that much? You’d rather throw her to the wolves in Castalia?”

I jerked my hand free, pain flashing across my face. “Stay out of it. Get lost.”

Sebastian stepped closer, eyes blazing red with anger.

“Vivienne’s ill—she has asthma. Sending her is no different from killing her. Helena, when did you become so cruel?”

“Did you know she couldn’t sleep last night? She’s burning with fever, and here you are, playing games with a gun!”

“Let. Go,” I snarled, jaw clenched.

“Don’t think getting rid of her means I’ll marry you,” he spat. “I’d never marry someone as cruel and calculating as you.”

“Even if Ms. Sinclair were still alive, I’m sure she’d say the same. You’d shamed your own sister’s name.”

For a moment, the hatred in his eyes took me straight back to our past life—

Back to those endless, vicious fights that always circled back to Vivienne, cutting each other open, again and again.

Before I could stop myself, I kicked him down and lifted the pistol. I fired just beside his shoulder, the shot cracking into the dirt near his arm.

“You don’t have the right to speak her name.”

He’d promised her once, back when we were seven, that he’d take care of me.

That promise died the day Vivienne entered our world. He claimed it was to “look after the sick,” but I knew better.

The screams around us jolted him back to reality.

He looked at the red welt on my shoulder from the recoil and hesitated—his expression softening.

“I’m sorry, Helena…”

I sidestepped before he could touch me, lips curling into a cold smile.

“It’s far from over. Maybe things are not what they seem. You’re jumping to conclusions, Sebastian.”

But he just laughed bitterly. “You’re the Whitmore heiress. Vivienne has no one. She’s all alone.”

He took a breath and looked at me—quietly, almost pleading.

“Helena… please. For the sake of everything we were, let Vivienne go.”

I gripped the pistol tighter and turned without another word. My chest heaved for just a second from how hard I was clenching my breath.

But this time, I was the one going to Castalia.

You got your wish, Sebastian Lowell.

That night, he sent a porcelain doll—just like he used to when we were children and he’d wronged me.

I sent it right back without a second thought.

All those years, I thought he stayed by my side because of our childhood, because of the bond we shared.

It took five years of a miserable marriage to wake me up.

He was kind out of duty—but it was always Vivienne he ached for.

And if that’s the case, then I have no reason to keep him in my life.

# Chapter 3

I went to my father and asked for my mother’s belongings back—

just a sketchbook and easel that looked plain on the outside. But inside were nearly monthly portraits of me before the age of six—

Each drawn while she was bedridden, clinging to what little life she had left.

Each page carried the quiet, unwavering love of a mother etched in fading pencil lines.

I didn’t learn the truth until Vivienne moved into our home—That my mother had had taken her own life, driven to despair after my father’s affair.

Vivienne was just two years younger than me.

The day I found out, I nearly beat her within an inch of her life.

But my father used my mother’s last keepsakes to shut me up—

Threatening to destroy them if I ever revealed Vivienne’s bloodline.

Now that I was about to leave for Castalia, it was time to even the score.

I took the sketchbook, paid a visit to my uncle, and then made a quiet stop at the Whitmore Group’s boardroom.

After years of swallowing humiliation, I wouldn’t leave without leaving behind a gift—for Richard, and for his precious bastard daughter.

Of course, none of it could leak before I left the country.

The timing had to be… surgical.

When I got home, my bedroom had been completely emptied.

Everything I owned had been dumped into the living room—

Including the thirty-seven porcelain dolls Sebastian once crafted by my hand.

Each lay shattered, their delicate pieces scattered like worthless junk.

Vivienne stood nearby, guilt across her fate–but the gleam in her eyes gave her away.

“I’m so sorry, Helena,” she stammered. “Dad said your room gets the best light—it will help me recover fast.”

“As for the dolls, the maids knocked them over while moving furniture. I’ll pay for them, whatever they cost. Daddy just gave me his Signature Gold Concierge Card.”

She held it up so casually—the very card reserved for the Whitmore heir.

I stepped forward, expression unreadable.

Sebastian suddenly moved between us, as if bracing for an attack.

“They’re just dolls, Helena. Is this really worth a meltdown?”

But they weren’t just dolls.

Sebastian had crafted every one of them by hand.

He once promised he’d keep making them for me—for as long as I liked.

Turns out his promises were just as fragile—and short-lived—as porcelain.

All it took was one little stunt from Vivienne, and they crumbled to dust.

Maybe my mistake was believing the promises of a man who’d already made his choice..

When I caught the smug glint in Vivienne’s eyes, I realized how pointless it all was.

I brushed past Sebastian, picked up my luggage, and moved into the guest room without a word.

He stood frozen at the bottom of the stairs, frowning as he watched me leave.

The next morning, there was a knock at my door.

I opened it to find all thirty-seven porcelain dolls lined up in silence—brand new, unfired, still soft touch.

There was only one person who’d do this.

I let out a bitter laugh and shut the door without a word.

But half an hour later, I opened the door again.

And this time brought the dolls inside.

# Chapter 4

Four days before my departure, aside from wringing a “dowry” out of that sorry excuse for a father, I s threw myself into training—pushing my body, sharpening my aim.

After riding practice, I came home to find Richard hosting a lavish birthday party for Vivienne.

As I walked in, she was descending the stairs in a gown from my own wardrobe—dripping in crystal sequins, playing the part of a noble heiress in front of a crowd that clapped like trained seals.

A few of her loyal little followers spotted me and curled their lips into sneers.

“Vivienne’s about to marry into nobility, and her sister can’t show up for her birthday. Talk about heartless.”

“What do you expect? She’s the one who chickened out and forced Vivienne to take her place. That kind of heartless witch doesn’t care about family.”

Clearly, while I was gone, Vivienne had been spreading her sob story to anyone who’d listen.

I turned to head upstairs, not wasting breath on idiots.

But they blocked my way—eyes darting toward Vivienne, then back to me with feigned outrage.

“Running off already? What’s the matter—guilty much?”

“Lady Sinclair must be turning in her grave, seeing how savage her daughter turned out!”

Before she could finish, I snapped the whip from my riding lesson—it cracked through the air, slamming her straight into the drink table.

Glass shattered. Blood bloomed.

She screamed, collapsed, crystal shards embedded in her arms.

I stepped forward, cool and calm. “Now that’s savage.”

The entire room froze, stunned by the sudden explosion of violence.

Then—chaos.

“Call an ambulance!”

“She’s insane! She did it on purpose!”

As the noise surged around me, I climbed the stairs without looking back, whip in hand.

Vivienne stormed out of the room, rage burning in her eyes.

“You volunteered for this, remember? Now I have to stay and care for your father, and you still ruin my birthday?”

I grabbed her chin with one hand, lips curling into a faint smile. “Volunteered?”

“You’re a homewrecker’s bastard with nothing but cheap tricks up your sleeve. The Syndicate isn’t a dumpster for hand-me-down bastards. If they don’t like what they see, they’ll toss you out like yesterday’s trash.”

“And as for taking care of him?”

I tightened my grip. Her face went pale with pain.

“Are you caring for Richard Whitmore or just circling his inheritance? You know damn well which it is. So drop the act—you’re making people sick.”

Her cheeks flushed crimson with fury, but she didn’t dare argue out loud.

She fled sobbing—no, screaming—as three slender red snakes slid behind her like shadows.

“I know I shouldn’t have used your room—but did you really have to scare me like that?”

“I… I can’t breathe… my asthma—it’s acting up again…”

She gasped dramatically and collapsed to the floor, clutching her chest.

“Vivienne!”

Sebastian rushed over and pulled her into his arms, glaring up at me with barely restrained fury.

“Are you out of your mind? Do you even know what a shock like that could do to someone with asthma?! Are you insane?”

“You think I did this?”

He gritted his teeth. “Who else? Vivienne wouldn’t hurt a fly. But you? Helena—you ride, you shoot, you climb cliffs. Nothing you do would surprise me.”

“God, what if something rally happens to her? Then what? Who’s supposed to marry into the Syndicate in your place?”

Furious, I grabbed one of the snakes by the head and flung it straight at Vivienne.

“Ahhh!”

She shrieked as it landed inches her face, her pupils shrinking with terror—funny how her asthma vanished.

I wanted to see if Sebastian would still defend her after that.

Of course, just as it neared her, Sebastian lunged forward—his grip crushing my wrist like a vice.

“Still denying it? Helena, when did you become so cold and cruel?”

Just like before.

Whenever it came to Vivienne, we’d go to war without hesitation.

But neither of us ever walked away.

“Enough!”

Richard stormed into the room, livid.

“This is what I get for not disciplining you! Attacking your own sister like this?!”

“I don’t have a daughter like you. You are dead to me—get out of my house!”

I turned, lips curled in a frigid smile.

Vivienne, ever the fragile saint, sniffled tearfully.

“Please… don’t scold her on my account…”

But Sebastian stayed silent.

He laid her in Richard’s arms with care—and then, quietly, fell into step behind me.

“I’ll take you home.

# Chapter 5

Sebastian drove me to Willowcrest Cottage—

the private retreat my mother left me, a place only she and I ever shared. When we were young, he’d always come here with me whenever I was upset.

It used to be our escape—from them, from the house, from everything.

Before he left, he looked at me with something unreadable in his eyes.

“Want me to stay the night?” he asked quietly.

I did not turn around, voice glacial. “No. And don’t ever set foot here again.”

His breath caught—ragged and uneven.

Just as the door shut behind him, I heard a whisper, faint as a dying flame:

“…I’m sorry.”

I had no intention of going back to that house full of lies—

But my mother’s things still waited for me there. I brought a moving crew with me, just in case.



I didn’t expect to walk into the living room—and find Vivienne giggling as she smeared bright paint across one of my mother’s last surviving sketches.

The canvas was ruined—just smears of color and the echo of something precious, lost.

“Put that down!”

I shouted so sharply she jumped, flinching like a child caught stealing.

Then she stumbled—conveniently—straight into the easel.

Crash.

The last piece of my mother’s world shattered into splinters.

Vivienne scrambled up, slapped herself theatrically, like a child putting on a show, and then dropped to her knees—right on the one intact piece of the ruined stand.

“I’m so sorry, Helena! I didn’t mean to! I was upset and asked Sebastian to bring over some supplies to distract me. Please don’t be angry—I’ll buy you a whole new set, I promise!”

Rage blurred my vision.

My hand flew to the fruit knife on the coffee table—burning with the urge to carve her open.

I wanted to carve her open.

But before I could move, Sebastian stepped between us, holding me back.

“They were just some old drawings,” he said. “If they matter so much, I’ll get you perfect replicas.”

I stared at him, trembling with rage.

“Do you even understand what you just said? That was all I had left of my mother.”

“I know.” His voice faltered. “But you destroyed Vivienne’s future. Isn’t that worth a few pieces of paper in return?”

My fingers clenched tighter around the knife.

“You think you get to touch anything that’s mine?!”

Before he could dodge, the blade grazed his hand—not deep, but enough for blood to fall in slow, steady drops.

It dripped steadily to the floor.

“No! Don’t hurt him!” Vivienne screamed, lunging forward. “It’s my fault—don’t take it out on him! He’s a surgeon, his hands—he needs his hands!”

I raised the knife again, this time heading straight for her face.

“Stop!” Sebastian roared.

I didn’t.

He wrapped an arm around Vivienne and shoved me back with all his strength.

“I said STOP!” My head slammed into the corner of the wall. Warmth spilled down my forehead—thick, sticky, red.

Sebastian froze, eyes wide with horror. He let go of Vivienne and rushed to my side, gathering me into his arms.

“Why do you always do this?” he muttered hoarsely. “You throw yourself over the edge—just to make me feel like the villain… Is that what you want?”

The words slipped out of him like instinct.

But even he looked stunned at his own words.

Always?

Helena Whitmore was never the type to hurt herself for pity.

So why did he say it like this had happened before?

# Chapter 6

I was barely conscious when they took me to the hospital.

Sebastian didn’t leave my side for three days.

When I finally woke up, he was sitting by my bed, quietly peeling an apple, his expression unreadable—the weight in his silence heavier than anything I’d ever seen.

“I’ll marry you,” he said at last.

“I never forgot the promise I made.”

I said nothing.

He held out a slice. “I said I’d protect you for life. I meant it.”

Then came the words that ruined it.

“But Vivienne… don’t make things hard for her.”

I turned my head and pulled the blanket over my face, hiding the sting, hiding everything.

He stayed for a moment longer, watching me in silence.

Then he placed the apple on the nightstand and left.

I knew exactly where he was going—back to her.

That afternoon, I checked myself out.

Hat low, mask on, I disappeared into the airport crowd—alone.

I never expected him to come after me.

But just before boarding, Sebastian showed up, out of breath and eyes full of regret.

“I didn’t protect you like I should have,” he said softly. “Whatever happens from now on… call me, okay?”

I glanced at him—just briefly, caught off guard.

Then he pressed a card into my hand.

“Take it… an apology… from your sister. She’s got a temper, but… try to understand her, yeah?”

Did he seriously think I was Vivienne?

I nearly laughed out loud. The audacity. I slapped his hand away.

“It’s not too late to undo the mess you made,” I said coldly.

Sebastian stepped closer.

“I can help. New name. New passport. Just vanish for a while–I’ll cover it all.

Lake Como, Italy, is a stunning destination that offers a perfect blend of activities and relaxation, transforming your travel experience into something truly memorable. Nestled in the foothills of the Alps, this picturesque lake is not just a feast for the eyes but also a canvas for adventure and discovery.

Start your journey by exploring the charming towns of Bellagio, Varenna, and Menaggio. Stroll along the narrow cobblestone streets, marveling at the centuries-old architecture and breathtaking lake views. Each town offers unique shops and cafés where you can enjoy a leisurely coffee or gelato, ensuring a balanced experience of sightseeing and rest.

For the adventurous souls, Lake Como is a paradise. Consider hiking the Sentiero del Viandante, a scenic trail that runs along the eastern shore of the lake, providing awe-inspiring vistas. Water sports like kayaking and sailing offer a different perspective of the lake’s beauty while keeping your adrenaline pumping. Take a boat tour to explore the beautiful villas dotting the shoreline, such as the famous Villa del Balbianello, each telling tales of history amidst lush gardens.

After a day of exploration, indulge in the local cuisine. Savor traditional dishes at lakeside restaurants, where you can unwind with a glass of fine Italian wine while watching the sun set over the water. The culinary experience complements your active day, allowing for both enjoyment and rejuvenation.

Finally, don’t forget to take some time for self-reflection at tranquil spots around the lake. Find a serene bench or take a peaceful lakeside walk to absorb the natural beauty that surrounds you. This balance of activities and rest—between exploration and relaxation—ensures a transformed journey that leaves you with unforgettable memories of Lake Como, Italy.

1mittgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Timor/comments/1mittgi/solo_travel_basics_2025_from_an_american/,Solo Travel Basics 2025 from an American,"Writing this from the Díli airport to share a bunch of miscellaneous travel tips for anyone visiting Timor-Leste (East Timor) in August 2025 or later.

I bought an Airalo “Discover” eSIM and activated it prior to getting to the country assuming it would work. It did not work. I instead bought an ESIM at the airport from Telkomcel (the booth all the way to the right of the three SIM card booths when you exit the airport) for $14.50 USD that gave me unlimited high speed data for 7 days. Data was fast enough for regular Instagram and Reddit usage. I experienced only about 15 minutes per day of outage, but restarting my phone usually fixed it. I have a U.S. purchased iPhone 15 pro.

They do not accept $1 bills here - I was very surprised to learn that. Ideally, bring enough $5 and $10 USD bills. Larger places will take $20 USD, but smaller places and taxis might not be able to give you change. The local currency is centivos where a 100 centivo coin is equal to $1 USD.

Quality of bills matters - places will not accept a raggedy or tattered $5 or $10. Make sure your bills aren’t ripped or fraying.

The taxis from the airport cost $15 to most destinations in the city. The taxi cars are very very old and do not have seatbelts.

There is no water refill at the airport. I would recommend bringing enough water from your original flight destination to keep you hydrated until you get to your accommodations or a grocery store.

There aren’t really mosquitos during the daytime. When it gets dark (6:30pm in August) the mosquitos come out in force. I had some 100% deet (maybe it was 97% deet) bug spray and avoided getting bitten by putting some on in the evening and reapplying right before sleep.

I did not connect to WiFi a single time in the country. BUT I had unlimited data. Most places like coffee shops or restaurants do not have wifi, outside of the highest end hotels.

There is no Uber/Lyft/Grab, so you will need old school taxis to transit. I recommend getting the WhatsApp number of at least one taxi driver if you can communicate with them well. You can WhatsApp message them to ask for a ride and if business is slow (as is typical), they will come pick you up.

Most places don’t have written addresses in the country. Send a screenshot of Google/Apple maps with your location circled to help your taxi driver find you if you’re not in one of the main locations.

It is possible to walk around the city, but there are no stoplights so crossing the road can be very dangerous. The safest place to walk is Avenida de Portugal which is right by the water in the northern part of the city.

Timor Plaza shopping mall is the safest, most central place for food. Most things there are $5-7 USD to be paid in cash. I did not use my credit card a single time in the country.

I saw one ATM my whole time here, but did not try to use it. I recommend having about $150 cash per day minimum, but more if you are doing tours. My day tour was $220 and I brought about $500 total to the country. I have about $100 remaining leaving after two days.

That’s all for now - I will share more about tours and experiences after I have some downtime post-transit! For now though, I had a great experience with JUBENTOS Timor Adventures (successor to the widely-reviewed Timor Adventures company that also used to be run by the same guy Julio, but that stopped operating during the pandemic then rebranded and came back) so if you need a Díli tour in a pinch, that’s a great company to go with. You can find their website and WhatsApp them there.",3,1754450214.0,Timor,0,1.0,False

1mitoq4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mitoq4,"Rare gem near Guting MRT, our dream apartment is up for rent (Western-style, renovated)","We’re not putting this on any rental sites just yet. Thought I’d share here first in case someone’s looking for something special.

A little backstory:
I’m American and have been living in Taiwan for 15 years. My husband’s Taiwanese. A few years ago, we bought this apartment and renovated it ourselves… literally made it our dream home. We thought we’d be here forever. So everything was designed with comfort, quality, and long-term living in mind.

We didn’t cut corners. This wasn’t a flip or a landlord project. We chose materials and appliances that made daily life feel easy and cozy. If you’ve ever walked into a Taipei rental and immediately wanted to replace everything, you’ll get why this place feels different.

We lived here until recently, but after having kids, we needed more space and moved out to Linkou. Since then, a close friend has been living here but he’s moving out this month, so we’re looking for someone new.

It’s not massive, but it’s one of those rare Taipei apartments where every detail has been considered. It lives larger than it looks, whether you’re cooking, working, or hosting a couple friends. Originally a 2-bedroom, but we knocked down a wall to make the layout more open. Now it’s a large 1-bedroom plus a dining room, chill spot, or office space. It’s on the 5th floor of a walk-up (no elevator), but it gets decent light and feels surprisingly quiet for how central it is.

The location’s excellent! Just a 3-minute walk to Guting MRT (green/orange lines), and tucked away on a quieter side street. You can walk to coffee, groceries, breakfast shops, etc. Super livable. Super close to NTU AND NTNU.

Practical details:
-Rent is $48K/month.
-Water, electricity, internet is separate.
-Standard two-month deposit.
-One-year lease minimum. Long-term preferred.
-Pets are welcome, just be the kind of owner we’d want as a neighbor. We’re animal lovers ourselves and know how hard it can be to find a pet-friendly place in the city.

Some of the things that made this place feel like home:
• Real wood floors (not laminate)
• Western-style kitchen: Bosch dishwasher, oven, stovetop, fridge
• Panasonic AC units with heat in every room (soooo nice in winter)
• Floor-to-ceiling windows/sliding doors
• Toto toilet
• Huge shower + tub combo
• Silent double-paned windows
• Built-in water filter at the kitchen sink
• Tons of built-in storage in the bedroom (custom wardrobe)
• Built-in bookshelf in extra room
• Large Panasonic Washing machine
• Partially furnished: TV, kitchen chairs, and a few other items 

It’s a 5th floor walk-up, and the water heater is gas (pretty standard for older buildings but means you’ll need to replace the tank when it runs out), but overall it’s a warm, functional space that really feels like home… because it was.

Move-in anytime after mid-August. Hoping to confirm someone by end of the month.

We’re not looking for just any renter — ideally someone who’ll appreciate the space, care for it, and really enjoy living here like we did.

We’re an American–Taiwanese couple. English and Chinese both fine. Happy to answer questions or show the place.

I couldn’t help but wonder how intentional it seemed given that she was talking about Interstellar and worm holes before that happened.

Nowadays, women are getting 100s of DMs and constant attention on social media. So just sliding into her DMs with “hi” or “you’re cute” is not going to make any difference. In fact, being desperate makes you look low-value.

But if you live a good life  you're working on your goals, you have achievements, you ride a nice bike, dress well, keep yourself fit — then your attention has value.
That’s why, never beg for attention. Just drop one message. If she’s genuinely interested, she’ll respond. If not, then apply my rule: FDB  Fk The Bitch.**

Yes, harsh words — but it’s about mindset, not disrespect. If she ignores your attention, then you ignore her and smile at another woman.

Out of 10 women:

5 might give you their WhatsApp.

Out of those 5, 3 will actually have conversations.

Then ask for a coffee meet. If she gives excuses and bullshit, FDB.

Out of 3, 2 may go out with you. Then ask for dinner.

If she rejects again, FDB.

1 might vibe with you, maybe even become desperate for your time.
That’s a high-quality woman. If not, keep moving.


This is the cycle:
Women want attention. Men want sex.
If the cycle is broken, men become needy, women lose interest. So don’t break the cycle  level up, give less attention, and never chase.

Remember:
High-value men don’t beg. They choose.

Had a light breakfast 3 cups of black coffee with monk fruit to ready myself for this last night. Was watching videos on Mikey Musumeci's diet and wanted to give it a try with my own spin on my current low tdee maintenance phase. I honestly love how the pizza turned out looks and taste wise. As for the mashed potatoes, they tasted great imo, but could make it look and taste a bit better next time as I rushed quite a bit and didnt get them that right creamy texture. Ray's no sugar bbq sauce always comes in clutch though. Next time I will try to increase the size of the pizza which shouldnt add more than 100 calories, I think waiting to eat this after 2 training sessions and work throughout the day was worth it. 8.5/10 tasted good and stayed full throughout the entire night and leaves 200-300 calories to play with depending on if you like snacking, a light breakfast/smoothie, light dessert.",12,1754448802.0,1200isplenty,4,0.88,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

I lived off bread and eggs. No coffee, no takeout.  
My girlfriend broke up with me. Said I was emotionally unavailable.  
I couldn’t focus. My lease ended. I crashed on a friend’s couch.

Every day I worked from McDonald’s with a $2 refill and my laptop.  
I didn’t have a roadmap. No investors. No followers.  
Just one belief:

*If I couldn’t fix my own relationship, maybe I could help someone else fix theirs.*

One day one guy sitting nearby started talking to me.  
Turned out he was a licensed therapist.  
I told him my idea. He loved it.  
He became the app’s first expert — even filmed welcome videos.

A few weeks later, I messaged a well-known relationship coach on Instagram with over 700k followers.  
To my surprise, she replied.  
She said the app felt “too cold… like a spreadsheet.”  
“Where’s the softness?” she asked.  
“Where’s the healing?”  
She was right.

I pulled 20-hour days rewriting everything — the copy, the colors, the onboarding flow.  
I needed to resubmit by Friday to hit the Sunday morning release window.  
Barely made it.

I launched at 9:00 AM Sunday.

That same day, I DMed every person I knew who had ever vented to me about a breakup.  
Ex-coworkers. Old friends. Random internet strangers.  
Just trying to get it into the right hands.

Monday morning, I checked the dashboard:  
It featured #1 on Product Hunt.  
It made $17,000 in revenue the next week.

I just stared at the screen.  
For the first time in months, I breathed.  
And yeah… I cried.

>**None of that happened.**

Not the bread and eggs.  
Not the breakup.  
Not the therapist at McDonald’s.  
Not the Instagram coach.  
Not the Product Hunt launch.  
Not the crying.  
Not the $17K.

But you read it all, didn’t you?

That’s the power of storytelling.

Now imagine if I posted this instead:  
“Hey, I made a relationship coaching app. Wanna sign up?”

You’d scroll past it without a second thought.

But version one?  
You felt something.  
You rooted for the underdog.  
You wanted to know how it ended.

That’s what stories do.

If you’re building something and nobody cares:

* Don’t just pitch.
* Tell the real story.
* Show the friction, not just the features.
* Make it feel like something.

Because people don’t share landing pages.  
They share narratives.

Would love to hear yours too.

I was kind of scared at first. I first met these people in a bar and they have been the best friends a person can ask for. But, I was worried if they are gonna get on my case for not drinking, you know? Like, “hey buddy, no beers? No shots? What’s wrong?”

Funny moment: they tried some weird “Mexican candy” shot, and asked me if I was interested. I said no, and the bartender was like: “yeah, I figured you didn’t want one, but I wanted to ask.” Drinks come, shots taken, and the “uuuck” faces on these dudes, and their “oh damn this is terrible” moment made me doubly proud of my choice.

But no, nobody cared that I was crushing coffee and water all day. The bartender didn’t even care that I needed a second pot of coffee. In fact, I left with a tab of zero dollars. It felt nice to have a sober outing (at a bar) with my drinking homies and I didn’t get questioned, pressured, or anything. They just kind of did their thing while I did mine.

I love my friends. Peer pressure is real at any age, especially if you are around other folks that can handle their drinks better than we can.

We started texting back and forth on Bumble and met up for coffee our first date which was a little over two weeks ago. We had a decent convo over Bumble but I initiated the plans to meet up for coffee. We then meet up for coffee. He asked me for my number during the date and we proceeded to do work together until about 8pm that day. Spending about 8 hours together. On the first date, he seemed very interested, holding my hand, asking to kiss me, and putting his arm around me on the bench. 

Then I don’t hear from him until this past Friday, 5 days later. He texts me asking me how I’m doing and that he really enjoyed our date. He said he’s been super busy and that he felt sick this week and had to take work off. He also has a really demanding work schedule as he works in the medical field. I reciprocated that I enjoyed our date too. He then asked me if I wanted to meet on Saturday. 

Fast forward to Saturday, I text him confirming plans and we meet up. We have an amazing date together. We hold hands, have good banter and conversations, we grab drinks, and I feel like we got physically closer. When he drove us he put his hand on my thigh. We go back to his house for a movie and we cuddle a bit and then I drive myself home. He followed up the date the next day saying he had a lot of fun. I reciprocated the sentiment and I added that I hope he has a good day. He said “thanks, you too!” And I hearted his message.

It’s 8pm and I’m kinda overthinking that he hasn’t texted me. I’m thinking to follow up tomorrow and ask him how his week is going? Is his lack of communication a sign of disinterest or him taking it slow?

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

I was the kid who didn’t talk back, who didn’t cry too loud, who didn’t make scenes in public. My parents loved to brag: *“She’s so well-behaved!”* What they meant was: *“She doesn’t need anything.”*

I learned early that speaking up meant drama, punishment, or just being brushed off. So I stopped. I became the listener. The “mature one.” The one who handled her own emotions quietly.

Fast forward to this year, I’m in my first real relationship. Nothing toxic, just… moments. Moments where I’d feel uncomfortable but say nothing. Moments where I’d laugh off things that actually hurt. Moments where I’d bite my tongue even when I wanted to scream, *“This isn’t okay.”*

Last month, we got into an argument. I don't even remember how it started, something about plans changing. But I froze. Completely shut down. My partner kept asking, “What’s wrong? Just talk to me.” And I literally couldn’t. Not because I didn’t want to. Because I didn’t *know how.*

That moment shook me. I realized I’d been carrying a silence I never chose, but learned. I wasn’t being chill or easygoing. I was just conditioned to shrink myself for peace.

Since then, I’ve started journaling again. Saying “no” to small things. Even correcting my coffee order when it's wrong. It might sound silly, but it’s a start.

Silence can be comforting, but not when it’s hiding your voice.",5,1754448494.0,story,0,1.0,False

Just got off Freedom OTS 3 night.  On the second night, my wife (in my room) and daughters (in the room next door) decided to order the continental breakfast because they had an early excursion in Nassau and we knew that Windjammer would be slammed.  So, they filled out the form, and we put it on each door around 10:30pm or 11ish, with a 7am requested service delivery.  Went to bed, slept well.

I got up around 6:30 the next morning to head down to Cafe Promenade and get the coffee for my wife and I.  Immediately noticed that the hangers on both rooms were still on the doors.  Not a good sign!  It's been years since I have ordered the breakfast on RCCL, so I was not totally sure how it worked, but I figured that if they did not pick up the hangers, then no food was going to be delivered.  So I grabbed some pastries at Cafe Promenade for everyone.

I am guessing that this is not a miss by the room steward, and that someone from the food service staff makes a tour sometime after midnight or 2am to collect these.   Has anyone ever had similar issues on RCCL?  It was not a biggie, and I did not mention it to anyone, but I may mention it in the survey if I can confirm that it's not going to reflect badly on the room steward.  It's such a minor issue that I don't want to get anyone in trouble over it, so maybe there is no way to mention it and NOT have it traced back to a specific employee.  I am definitely glad that I was able to grab stuff at Cafe Promenade instead of sitting in the room waiting for food that was never going to show up.

Chapter Fourteen
lost one.

I woke to wetness.
Not just damp — soaked. Cold seeped into my spine through the stone beneath me, muddy and uneven. Water dripped from somewhere high above, rhythmic and hollow, like a ticking clock counting down.
My wrists were bound. My ankles, too — tight rope, rough against skin rubbed raw.
I tried to move. I couldn’t.
It was pitch black, but I knew I wasn’t alone.
I could feel them. Breathing.
Then came the first flicker of light.
Candles — faint and scattered — nestled into holes in the dirt walls like watching eyes. They cast long, flickering shadows across what looked like a tunnel carved crudely from the earth. The air was thick with mildew and rot. Something had died down here. Or was still dying.
The moment I shifted, the figures moved.
I hadn’t noticed them until then. They hadn’t made a sound.
There were dozens.
Standing silently against the walls in stained robes — hooded, faceless. Their fabric hung like old parchment, waterlogged and clinging to their thin frames. Some had symbols drawn across their chests in what looked like ash. Others… in something darker.
They didn’t speak.
They didn’t need to.
Their presence was a pressure, like the air itself was being strangled around me.
And then — they began to chant.
A low, guttural sound at first, like wind through a cave. Then louder. Sharper. Words I didn’t know but somehow recognized. Words that scraped against my brain like glass on bone. The sound filled the space, bouncing off the walls, making the candles tremble.
I whimpered. I didn’t mean to, but the sound slipped out.
One of them broke away from the wall.
They crept toward me with slow, calculated steps — not clumsy or stiff, but practiced, like they’d done this a hundred times before. Like they’d been waiting.
They knelt beside me, their face hidden beneath the hood.
I could feel their breath — wet and cold.
“Welcome back, lost one.”
The voice was genderless. Soft, almost kind — but hollow, like it had no soul behind it.
They pressed something cold against my forehead — a stone, or maybe bone. It stung. Then they stepped back.
Another figure came forward.
“Welcome back, lost one.”
Over and over.
Each one leaned in close, whispered those same words like a curse, and stepped away. By the seventh, I was trembling. By the tenth, I couldn’t breathe.
My pulse was thundering in my ears. I could barely see.
The room felt alive, breathing, pulsing, throbbing with the rhythm of the chant.
Then the final figure stepped out of the shadows.
Their robe was darker than the rest. Blackened at the sleeves. Wet at the hem.
They didn’t walk — they glided.
The others moved aside to let them pass, heads bowed.
The figure crouched down in front of me.
Their hood hung low, but I could just barely make out a mouth — wide, colorless, cracked. It didn’t move when they spoke.
The voice slithered out.
“Lanie is to blame.”
I froze.
“You must remove the threat…”
The other voices fell completely silent. Even the dripping water seemed to stop.
“…and restore the balance back to Earth.”
Their face was inches from mine now.
I could smell decay on their breath.
“Or God will be displeased…”
They reached a hand toward me — long fingers, bone-thin.
“…and punish you, Emily Harper.”
When they said my name, it felt like a nail being driven into my spine. My vision blurred. I couldn’t even scream. My voice was gone.
Then — one by one — they came back.
The robed figures surrounded me in a perfect circle.
Each knelt at my wrists.
Each pulled up my sleeve, baring skin already mottled with dirt and bruises.
Their fingers were cold, wet — they dipped them into something thick and dark red in the bowls beside them.
Blood.
Still warm.
Fresh.
They rubbed it into my skin slowly, deliberately — pressing their thumbs into the hollow of my wrists, circling, staining.
As they marked me, they began to chant again, louder this time, more frenzied. The language twisted and snapped through the air, a kind of primal rhythm, like the sound of insects skittering just beneath your skin.
The pressure in the room grew unbearable. I felt like I was being swallowed. Like the earth itself wanted me gone.
My body shook. I tried to scream. Nothing came out.
The last figure pulled away from me and raised their hands toward the dripping ceiling.
The candles blew out — every single one.
And in the instant before I lost consciousness, I heard it:
A voice that did not belong to anyone in that room.
A voice that came from inside me.
“You were never meant to leave.”
And then—
blackness.

Chapter Fifteen
“Was it real… or was I?”

I woke up staring at the ceiling.
The familiar water stain above the window.
The soft whir of the fan near the bed.
Light slanting through the blinds, catching on floating dust.
My apartment.
I sat up slowly. My sheets weren’t dirty. No bruises on my wrists. No blood.
The books were still on the table. The notebook open where I’d left it. My phone charging beside the bed. The hum of traffic outside.
Normal.
Too normal.
I moved through the space like a ghost. Everything was untouched — my mug still in the sink from two days ago, laundry still unfolded in the basket by the couch. The books I’d checked out from the library sat in a neat stack.
No candles.
No dirt.
No chanting voices.
Had I dreamed it all?
The underground chamber. The robes. The voice.
“God will be displeased.”
It rang in my skull like a warning bell.
I looked down at my hands. They didn’t shake.
But I could feel something… off.
Like my body remembered things my mind wanted to forget.
Then came the knock.
Three short raps at the door.
I didn’t move.
Then again, gentler.
“Emmy?”
Lanie’s voice.
I froze.
The name struck me like a slap. The sound of her outside the door made my stomach twist.
“It’s me… please open the door.”
Something inside me shifted.
Clicked.
Snapped into place.
Not me. Not mine. Not Emily.
The air in the room felt warped. Like the floor beneath me tilted. The warmth of sunlight meant nothing.
All I could hear were those words:
“Lanie is to blame.”
“Remove the threat.”
“Restore the balance.”
I walked to the door slowly, numb, floating.
When I opened it, Lanie rushed in like a storm, pulling her hood down, eyes wide.
“Oh thank God,” she breathed. “You’re okay.”
I said nothing.
She turned toward me. “Emmy, where the hell have you been? I—I’ve been calling nonstop. I even drove by your work just in case.” She gave a breathless little laugh. “I thought something happened to you. After the library—after what you said—I didn’t know what to think.”
Still, I said nothing.
She stepped closer, searching my face. “Are you sick? You look pale. Did something happen? Did you… remember something?”
I blinked at her slowly.
The light caught in her eyes. They looked full of worry. Love, even.
But to me, they looked like a lie.
“God will be displeased.”
“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “If I pushed you too hard. If telling you about the Restoration triggered something. I just—Emily, I thought you wanted to know the truth. I was only trying to help.”
The word help felt poisonous in my ears.
She kept talking.
“There’s something wrong with that place, I know there is. And I know you felt it too, the dreams, the—” she faltered, “—the memories, or whatever they are. But we can figure it out together. You and me. We always said that, right?”
I stared through her.
Her voice echoed like it was coming from underwater. My head throbbed.
Her hand brushed my arm gently.
“Please say something.”
My mouth opened. But it wasn’t my voice that wanted to come out.
I was stuck somewhere between two selves. One that loved her, needed her, trusted her—
—and one that knew she had to go.
The silence stretched until she whispered, “You’re scaring me.”
I tilted my head, studying her face like it belonged to someone I used to know.
I could still remember the warmth of her hands on mine. The way she smiled like she knew what I was thinking. The first time I’d seen her behind that counter at the café, humming along to some song I didn’t recognize.
But that felt like a memory that belonged to someone else now.
I wasn’t sure who I was anymore.
“Lanie is to blame.”
“You must remove the threat.”
Lanie’s brow furrowed. “Emmy?”
I looked down at her hand on my arm.
She was still touching me.
Still close.
Still here.
And I could feel it—inside me—rising.
Like something ancient had been stirred awake.
God will be displeased.
And all I could think was:
How easy it would be.

Chapter Sixteen
The body remembers what the mind denies.

“I’ll be right back,” I said softly.
My voice sounded flat. Hollow. Almost like someone else said it for me.
Lanie blinked, surprised, but nodded. “Okay. I’ll stay right here, Em.”
She smiled nervously and sat back on the couch, hugging her knees to her chest.
I turned and walked down the short hallway to my bedroom. The air felt thick, charged. Like walking underwater.
As I pushed open the door, I saw it immediately.
The knife.
It was laid across the center of my bed. Not tossed. Not dropped. Placed. Carefully.
The hilt faced me. Almost like an invitation.
It wasn’t one of my kitchen knives. I would’ve remembered one like this.
The blade was long and curved slightly, like a ritualistic sickle. Its edge was dark—too dark—and jagged like it had been forged by hand, not manufactured. Carved into the metal were symbols—tiny, etched markings that looked like the ones in the books from the library. Symbols I hadn’t been able to translate.
But somehow, I knew what they meant now.
Balance. Purity. Sacrifice.
The handle was wrapped in worn leather, stained a deep, rusted brown. Blood, I realized. Old. Years old, maybe more.
My fingers wrapped around it before I could think.
It was warm.
As though it had just been used.
And the moment I touched it, something in me went quiet. Still.
Like my mind had been pushed aside and something else had taken the wheel.
I turned and walked back toward the living room, knife gripped behind my back, hidden beneath the folds of my sweatshirt.
Lanie was still talking when I entered. Pacing slightly now, twisting her fingers together.
“I just think maybe something’s wrong. Like, seriously wrong, Emily. You haven’t been sleeping, and you’re seeing things. I know the Restoration stuff is dark, but maybe it triggered something. Like a memory or a trauma or—I don’t know.”
I didn’t speak.
She looked at me with soft eyes.
“I’m not saying you’re crazy. I’m not,” she said quickly. “I just—maybe you need help. Real help. I’ll go with you. I’ll stay with you. I love you, Em.”
That last part landed somewhere deep inside me. Buried beneath whatever had taken over.
But it wasn’t enough.
I stepped closer.
Lanie’s eyes flicked down, catching the shift in my posture. The tension. Her expression changed—concern turning into confusion. Then fear.
“Em…?”
She didn’t have time to say anything else.
The first stab landed just below her ribs.
She gasped—sharp and high-pitched—and stumbled backward into the table.
I followed.
Another stab.
And another.
And another.
Blood sprayed across my floor. Splattered up my arms. Warm. Immediate.
Lanie let out a choked sob, barely able to breathe.
I don’t know how many times I stabbed her. I didn’t count.
Only that I didn’t stop until she wasn’t moving.
Until her eyes were wide and glassy.
Until the blade stopped meeting resistance.
And then—
Silence.
Time restarted.
My hands were soaked. The knife slick. The smell of iron and bile filled the room.
Her blood was everywhere.
On me. On the floor. On her.
And she wasn’t breathing.
I stared at her body, heart pounding in my chest.
And suddenly, whatever had been inside me was gone.
Gone.
And I was back.
Truly back.
I dropped the knife and stumbled backward.
“No—no no no no—”
The words spilled from my lips like vomit.
I tripped over the rug and ran down the hallway, crashing into the bathroom and collapsing over the toilet.
My body heaved. I retched so hard I saw stars.
I couldn’t stop shaking.
When it was over, I looked up—slowly—into the mirror above the sink.
Blood on my neck.
Blood smeared across my cheek like war paint.
My eyes were wide and red-rimmed, and they didn’t look like mine. Again.
What did I do?
I pressed my hands to the sink, trying to breathe.
Tried to tell myself it wasn’t real.
Tried to tell myself it was another dream.
But the blood was real.
Lanie was real.
And now she was dead.
Because of me.
Because something told me to.
Because I listened.
Because I couldn’t stop it.
I sank to the floor, my back against the wall, hands still trembling and slick with blood.
And I cried like a child.


Chapter Seventeen
If it disappears, did it ever happen?

I don’t know how long I sat there on the bathroom floor.
Eventually the sobbing stopped.
The shaking dulled.
I could breathe again, if only just barely.
The tile was cold beneath me. The silence in the apartment was suffocating, loud in its emptiness. The kind of quiet that pressed in from all sides.
I dragged myself to my feet, swaying a little, and splashed water on my face. The sink was still running. The mirror still fogged from my panicked breath.
Blood was smeared across my shirt, my sleeves. Under my nails. Drying now.
It was real.
It had to be.
And that meant… Lanie’s body was still in the living room.
The thought almost dropped me again.
But some part of me—some buried, rational instinct—clicked on. A survival mechanism.
“You have to clean it.”
Not because it was the right thing.
Not because I wanted to.
Because something deep in me whispered: “If anyone sees this, it’s over.”
I stepped out of the bathroom, not letting myself look back toward the living room.
Down the hallway, just past the linen closet, was a narrow door. The utility closet.
I opened it with shaking hands and pulled out the bleach. A pack of old rags. A half-used bottle of carpet cleaner. Latex gloves. A trash bag.
I moved like I was sleepwalking.
Like I’d done this before.
Which terrified me more than anything.
Supplies in hand, I finally turned toward the living room.
And froze.
The blood was gone.
The body was gone.
The couch was clean. No stains on the floor. No broken lamp. No overturned table.
Just silence.
Just… normal.
Like nothing had happened at all.
I dropped the bag.
Walked slowly toward the couch.
No drag marks. No traces. Not even a stray dark spot.
The air didn’t even smell like iron anymore.
I dropped to my knees, touching the carpet where she had fallen—where I had stabbed her, over and over again.
Nothing.
My hands were clean.
I looked down at my arms.
Still clean.
The sleeves of my shirt were dry. White. Untouched.
I gasped and ran back down the hallway, flipping the bathroom light on.
No blood in the sink.
No smears on the floor.
I spun to the mirror and grabbed the edges of it.
My face was clean.
There was no blood.
No evidence.
Nothing at all.
My chest tightened.
“No, no, no. I didn’t make it up.”
I was whispering to myself now.
“She was here. She was here. I saw it. I did it. I felt it.”
I gripped the counter, knuckles white.
If she was gone—if everything was gone—then where was she?
Did someone come?
Did someone clean it up?
Or… was it never there to begin with?
Was this what madness felt like?
Was I still under their influence?
Still dreaming?
Or had I done something so horrible that my mind had simply erased it to survive?
I stumbled backward out of the bathroom, heart in my throat, ears ringing.
I looked at the front door.
Still locked.
The knife?
I turned back toward my room—but I already knew.
It was gone, too.
Not a drop of blood.
Not a sign of struggle.
Not a sound.
Just me.
Just silence.
Just that gnawing question crawling up my spine:
What is happening to me?


Chapter Eighteen
If no one remembers her… was she ever real?

I picked it up and opened my messages. Scrolled instinctively to her name.
Nothing.
The thread was gone.
No photos. No texts. No calls.
I blinked, backed out of the message app, and checked my recent calls.
Gone.
Her number wasn’t there.
Not even under the “recently deleted” section.
I scrolled faster. No voicemails. No history.
My throat tightened as I tapped out her number manually, the one I’d memorized weeks ago.
Ring.
Ring.
Then—
“You have reached an invalid number. Please check the number and try again.”
I stared at the screen, pulse pounding in my ears.
That didn’t make sense.
I had the number right.
I knew I did.
I tried texting her instead, just a single word:
“Lanie?”
A second passed. Then two.
And then:
Message Not Delivered.
I sent it again.
Same thing.
Undelivered. Gone.
I went back to the top of my contacts list.
Her name wasn’t there.
It was like she’d been erased.
Like she never existed in my phone at all.
I sat on the couch and stared at the wall, gripping my phone with both hands like it might slip away from me too.
Where did she go?
Where did my Lanie go?
The only person who ever made me feel seen.
Who didn’t talk to me like I was fragile or broken or halfway out of my mind.
She sat with me in silence when I needed it. Laughed at my awkward jokes. Gave me pieces of her past like puzzle fragments.
I knew her. I did.
She was real.
She had to be.
I grabbed my bag and keys and ran out the door.
The café was exactly as I remembered it. White-tile floor. Chalkboard menu hanging by the pastry case. The same lopsided fern by the window that was always a little too dry.
My eyes scanned the space, already knowing where she’d be—
Behind the counter. Hair pulled back.
She wasn’t there.
Just a guy with a beanie and a girl with purple hair, pouring drinks. No sign of Lanie.
I stepped up to the counter, heart hammering.
“Hi—sorry, um… is Lanie working today?”
The girl blinked at me. “Who?”
“Lanie,” I said again. “She’s usually here. Black hair, blonde streaks in the front. Kind of sarcastic? Beautiful?”
The barista glanced at the guy beside her, then back at me.
“I think you have the wrong café. No one named Lanie’s ever worked here.”
“No,” I said too quickly. “That’s not right. We’ve been here before. Together. We’ve sat at that table.” I pointed to the back corner by the window. “She always got black coffee, I got a mocha latte. We’ve talked here. Dozens of times.”
She gave me a cautious look. “Ma’am… you come in here a lot. But you’re always alone.”
The words felt like a slap.
I shook my head. “No. No, that’s not true. She was here with me. We—”
“We just thought maybe you were on the phone,” she added carefully, “or, like… talking to yourself.”
I felt my stomach drop. A cold rush of panic slid down my spine.
“You’re wrong,” I whispered. “She worked here. She was here.”
The barista’s eyes hardened. “If you don’t leave, we’ll have to call the cops.”
I didn’t remember the walk to the bookstore.
I just remember standing in front of the counter, the bell on the door still jingling behind me.
The older man behind the register looked up with a familiar tired smile.
“Hey there,” he said. “Back again already?”
I nodded stiffly. “Yeah. I was just wondering… do you remember a girl who used to come in here with me? Lanie?”
He blinked. “What?”
“Black hair, blonde streaks, leather jacket,” I said. “We used to sit by the horror section. She liked Shirley Jackson. I think you rang her up once—she bought a copy of House of Leaves.”
He frowned.
“I’m sorry, I don’t remember anyone like that. You usually come in alone. You sit on the floor by the far shelf for hours. Sometimes you hum. But I don’t remember you ever being with anyone.”
I couldn’t breathe.
The bookstore was closing in on me. The lights too bright. The walls too tight.
I turned and stumbled out the door, my vision blurring, the floor tilting beneath my feet.
Was I going crazy?
Had I made her up?
Every place we’d ever gone… every memory… all of it?
Gone.
Erased.
Like she never existed at all.

Chapter Nineteen
She’s finally awake

I was halfway down Fifth when the world tilted sideways.
One second I was walking, the next it was like the sky dropped an octave.
The streetlights flickered—buzzing so loudly it rattled my skull.
Cars froze mid-motion. Pedestrians stopped in their tracks, staring straight ahead like mannequins. A dog across the street lifted its head and let out a sharp, high-pitched howl—and then even it went still.
Everything paused.
I blinked and rubbed my eyes. Tried to breathe.
No one moved.
No one blinked.
Then the buzzing stopped—and so did my heart.
A splitting pain cracked through the center of my skull like lightning.
I stumbled. Tried to hold onto a mailbox. Missed.
And the world went black.
The room was white.
Not off-white. Not hospital white. Bleached. Blinding.
I blinked, vision hazy, pupils aching from the brightness.
The floor was smooth. Seamless. No doors. No windows. Just a single light above and the hum of something mechanical behind the walls.
I tried to sit up, but my arms felt heavy. Like I’d been drugged.
There were voices—muffled at first—whispering in a rhythm I couldn’t understand.
Then, like a needle slipping into place:
“She’s finally awake, my lord.”
I turned my head too fast. Pain lanced down my neck.
“My lord?” I rasped, voice cracked and unfamiliar.
“Where the fuck am I? Where is Lanie?”
Two figures stepped into view—clad in white from head to toe. No name tags. No expression. Their clothes looked sterile, ceremonial… not like scrubs. Like robes pretending to be medical garb.
They leaned over me, checking something by my wrist.
One of them was chanting softly, the syllables wrong—too many consonants. The other moved her fingers in slow circles above my skin like she was drawing symbols in the air.
I tried to pull my arm away, but my muscles refused.
I grabbed one of their arms anyway—barely—and managed to force her to look at me.
Her face was—
Wrong.
Distorted. Like I was seeing her underwater. Her eyes were too large, her mouth too wide. Her cheekbones too sharp and waxy. Something inside her skin twitched, like a heartbeat too close to the surface.
She leaned in close and smiled.
“Welcome home, Emily.”
Her voice was like rotted honey.
The other one moved closer.
“We’ve missed you,” she said gently.
The words were worse than screams.
I twisted, tried to break free, my breathing ragged. “Where am I? Where the hell is Lanie?”
Neither of them flinched.
“You’re safe now,” one said.
“You’re remembered,” said the other.
I screamed.
“I need to see her—I need to see her right now!”
They didn’t answer.
They just pressed their hands to my temples, whispered things that didn’t belong in any human language.
And behind their heads—behind the glaring light above me—I saw a shadow shift.
Someone else was in the room.
Watching.
Waiting.

Chapter Twenty
The missing piece has returned.

They brought me to the field at dawn.
The same one I had dreamed of. The one from the books. From the rituals. But this time… it was real.
I could feel the chill of dew soaking into my knees. The silence wasn’t empty—it was waiting.
The cult grounds stretched far and wide. A vast clearing of dead grass, patches of dark, upturned soil like something had clawed its way out. The sky was gray, soft and low, and in the distance stood the buildings I remembered from my nightmares: wood-rotted cabins with warped windows, a chapel without a cross, and a bell tower that never rang.
I didn’t know how I was standing.
My legs felt boneless, barely attached. Every step was a fight.
And then he spoke.
From the raised platform at the center of the field—a blackened altar framed by robed figures—he emerged.
The Lord.
His face was hidden beneath a thick hood. His voice sounded like it came from the bottom of the earth.
“The missing piece has returned,” he said.
“Emily Harper. Born of imbalance. Blood of consequence. You have wandered. You have betrayed. But now… you remember.”
I shook my head. “No—I don’t—this isn’t real—”
I tried to run. I got two steps before collapsing again.
My lungs burned. My vision blurred.
“You left your purpose behind,” the Lord continued, “but we have prepared your return. Everything you experienced—every love, every comfort, every illusion—was designed to bring you home.”
I screamed. Lanie’s name tore from my throat like a wound.
Nothing. No answer. No sign of her. Not even a trace.
Then—like a bolt of memory—I remembered the knife. The blood. My hands.
What I’d done.
“No…” I gasped. “No, no, no—Lanie—”
“Silence her,” the Lord commanded.
Several robed figures surrounded me. Cold hands grabbed my arms, my face. A thick cloth was shoved into my mouth, tied tight at the back of my head. My scream was cut off mid-breath.
I choked.
I sobbed.
I tried to fight them off but couldn’t move.
The chanting resumed. Their voices in unison, humming something low and unnatural.
The Lord raised his arms like a preacher and continued:
“From illusion, she will be reborn.
From forgetfulness, she will remember.
The mother is gone. The sister is gone.
But the daughter remains. The vessel endures.”
When the light faded, I found myself inside a cabin.
Not just any cabin—one from my dreams.
The inside smelled like old pine and damp dirt. A stove rested cold in the corner. The floorboards were uneven, warped with moisture. An old quilt lay over a splintered bedframe. There were cracks in the walls where light slithered through. Spiderwebs hugged the corners. And on the wooden table in front of me sat a notebook.
My notebook.
The same one I had in my apartment.
I reached for it with trembling fingers. The pages were blank.
Across from me, an older woman sat, her face pale and kind, but empty in the way nurses in bad dreams are.
She reached across the table and touched my wrist gently.
“Do you remember anything… while you were away?”
I couldn’t speak. I just stared.
“Write it down,” she said. “Everything you saw. Everything you felt. You’ll feel better once it’s on the page. You always do.”
I looked down at the pen.
I remembered Lanie’s smile. Her laugh. Her blonde streaks. The way she made me feel like I wasn’t disappearing.
But she wasn’t real.
None of it was.
The café. The apartment. My job. The nights we talked for hours.
It was all a veil.
A trap.
I never left the cult.
I had never escaped.
Everything had been fabricated to make me forget.
To erase my mother’s scream.
To erase my sister’s tiny, still body.
They made me forget them.
They made me forget who I was—so I could become what they needed me to be.
I picked up the pen.
And I began to write.

I’m—
I don’t know where—

it smells like smoke again
or something burned
or someone

I thought the field was behind me
but I can still feel grass in my mouth

Lanie was—
no, is?
no.

My name is Emily Harper.
I was born in—
(where was it?)

I keep writing it down so I don’t forget
but it’s not helping
it’s not helping
it’s not helping

They said I chose this
but I don’t remember choosing anything

She had two blonde streaks in her hair
I remember that
I remember that

I had a sister
(didn’t I?)

Why do I only remember the scream
not the sound before it

STOP

They’re watching me write this
I don’t know if I’m allowed to know this much

The light in the hallway just flickered

The Lord said I was the missing piece

So why do I feel erased

If you find this

don’t
the handwriting’s not mine
except it is
except it’s hers.
lanie?
me?
i’m not wearing my hands today. they feel                    like  gloves. too big. too loud.
the walls are breathing again.
they’re whispering.
no—chanting.
or maybe it’s just the pipes.
maybe it’s just them.
i found dirt under my nails.
was i outside again?
was that today?
my notebook smells like smoke.
my pillow is wet.
i wrote “remember” seventeen times in the margin and i don’t remember writing it once.
THEY LIED
THEY LIED
THEY LIED
they took lanie
they took my name
they folded me inside a different girl
and i’ve been walking around wearing her like skin
my mother’s voice is in the air vents.
i asked her what happened
she told me to hush.
she told me “they’re still watching.”
i saw my sister last night.
she was standing at the foot of my bed with no eyes.
just teeth.
and that music again—the hum.
low and slow like breathing
like something waiting.
like something hungry.
stop reading this.
stop stop stop
they’ll smell the ink.
they’ll smell the truth.
i need to burn this.
i need to bury this.
i need to—
wait.

1mit4b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceOCs/comments/1mit4b6/specialist_fravashi_grace_howard/,"Specialist (Fravashi): Grace Howard, Engineer/Blacksmith of The Asher Pirates:","[Gear Tinkerer ](https://preview.redd.it/mqka5qjy6bhf1.jpg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68216d61346395e907e989f54ab74224978f8f8a)

Bio: An orphan raised on Forger’s Archipelago, Grace has always held a fascination with machines after hearing about the exploits of Dr.Vegapunk, which led to her joining the island's construction company with the aim of someday getting to meet her idol in the flesh. A prodigy in her field, Grace was on her way to becoming one of the top mechanics on the island, when the World Government arrived and declared that the island construction company would from now on; only make constructs that the World Government wanted. The head of the company she works for, a man Khors, refused to bend the knee to the Government, only for him to mysteriously disappear after heading off to a meeting with Government officials, with the company shortly after being taken over by the World Government. Now, Grace has to prove to her fellow workers and her adoptive sister, Koleda, that Khors didn’t just abandon them, and that the World Government simply wants to use their skills to make weapons. Thankfully, a certain group of pirates just so happen to be arriving, ones who like to stir up trouble for the WG.

Personality: A good-natured if somewhat eccentric young woman, Grace is known for being someone who once she gets a vision of a machine design in her head, she won’t rest until she gets a working version of it up and running. She’s a bit quirky and scatterbrain when it comes to anything other than her machines, her social skills being less than optimal but she makes up for that by being rather bubbly and friendly to pretty much every person she meets. Grace is loyal to a fault and expresses a great desire to help; offering assistance to the other members of the construction company, with said behavior translating towards the crew after she joins them. This trait of hers has led her to jokingly being called a “mom” by both the workers and her crew-mates, though Grace is oblivious to this moniker as nobody mentions it.

As an Engineer, builder and dismantler, Grace has a prodigious intelligence and was the head of the R&D department of the company, seemingly always coming up with new ideas for machines that she sometimes would overwork herself; the workers in her department having to come over and make sure that she’s getting enough rest. Her drive for innovation and improvement also makes her somewhat reckless when doing her job, as she’s willing to throw herself into danger if it means fixing a problem on one of the machines. However, she’s only reckless when it comes to her own well being, as Grace is unwilling to risk the life of other people if something is wrong with one of her machines, and takes full responsibility for any damages that come about as a result. For Grace, her machines are like children to her and that means that she always puts all of her effort into making sure that they run and function properly, as she wants to avoid any of her creations from hurting and possibly even killing innocent people, showing that her drive for improvement comes from a deep humanitarian desire.

Grace lost her parents at a young age, and having been taken in by Khors she has a great sense of loyalty to him, refusing to believe that he abandoned the island and sold them to the World Government, unlike her adoptive sister. Also, while she’s slow to anger, Grace can and will become passionately filled with rage when she sees others disregard their responsibilities towards their creations, as it shows to her that they don’t care if what they make hurts people. Her desire to create machines also leads her to wanting to meet Dr. Vegapunk, the most brilliant mind on the planet, having read so much about his projects that he’s basically become her idol in the fields of robotics. This is also despite the fact that she knows he’s involved with the World Government, the organization she hates for causing Khors’s death, staining his name with lies and trying to take over the company on her home island.

Physical Appearance: A young woman who is 24 years old and stands at 5’7 in height, Grace has a fair skin tone with black hair tied into a short ponytail; with two side bangs that reach to her shoulders, her eyes are a soft reddish-amber color and she has an athletically toned yet curvy figure with a well-endowed chest. Grace also has a blue tattoo of a twin gear, one smaller gear inside of a large gear, on her right shoulder. Her main outfit is made up of a front zipper shockproof sports bra vest, exposing her midriff, tight, form-fitting tactical pants with two belts, one gray and one white around her waist; metal knee pads on each pants leg and a pair of black and gray sneakers with orange vertical stripe on the side. She also wears a pair of goggles with squared orange lens on her forehead, has a wears a belt harness underneath her vest, two different sets of arms sleeves; the right one made of black cloth material that reaches to her shoulder and underneath the strap of her vest, while the left one is made of black mesh material and reaches only to her above her bicep, along with a pair of different colored finger-less gloves, white for her right hand and black for the left and a white cape-like garment with a ring design at the ends hangs of her waist; reaching down above her ankles. Grace also has an assortment of pouches, one on the right strap of her vest, another two attached to the back of the harness underneath said vest, a white pouch on her arm below her shoulder, three hanging off the belt on the left side of her waist, and another hanging off the right sleeve of the white garment around her waist. She also has three grenades on belt on the right hip side, with another three hanging off a black belt connected to her white one; said belt having ammo clips for her nail gun attached to it as well.

Devil Fruit: None  
Fighting Style: Grace is a Gadget Fighter. Quick on her feet and capable of making leaps with the grace of a trained gymnast, Grace wields a variety of tools in her numerous pouches and in the satchel she wears for. Her main piece of weaponry comes in the form of a nail gun with a modular weapon system, allowing her to switch out certain parts of the gun for others, granting it different capabilities based on what Grace needs for certain occasions. She also carries a variety of grenades in her pouches, ranging from electric types, to ones capable of ensnaring her targets, and to even one capable of emanating a powerful flash and sound that stun her enemies. The goggles she wears on her head are also very useful, as they allow her to see from farther distance and have an infrared mode to them as well, helping her to fight by tracking enemy body heat.  
Weapon: A souped-up nail gun, and a variety of different kinds of grenades.  
Haki: Observation and Armament  
Bounty: 18,033,000 Berries/35,900,000 Berries  
Favorite Food: Sandwiches and Coffee  
Recruitment: 15th member to join.  
Dream: “To meet Dr.Vegapunk and create Machines that can think for themselves!”

(And now we have the third Character from ZZZ as a member of my crew, and can I just say, figuring out how to describe every single bit of Grace's outfit: Literal. Nightmare. It took me so long, I had to look through so many clothing descriptions and phrases for them, even then I feel like I still got some wrong, but I gave it my best shot and that's I all I could ask for. But yeah, I've always enjoy Grace character, she quirky and interesting and I just figured she make a great addition to the crew. Not to mention that her interest in Vegapunk would inherently create a plot point for the my crew to meet the guy, so that also helps out.)  
Well, 12 out of 20 down, 8 more to go! Next up with be another original character by me, the Resident Three-Eye tribe member of the crew. You'll see them tomorrow, so look forward for that tomorrow!",1,1754448157.0,OnePieceOCs,0,1.0,False

chapter seven
Late Hours 

I stayed after six.

But just after—around 6:15—Jay passed by my desk on his way out. His keys jingled in one hand, blazer slung over his shoulder like always. He paused when he saw me still typing, his brow lifting with quiet surprise.

“Emily,” he said. “You’re still here?”

I didn’t look up from my screen. “Just making up the work from today.”

He stepped closer, folding his arms in a way that meant concerned boss mode was kicking in.

“You know you don’t have to push yourself like this. You’re already my best. If something’s going on… we can talk.”

I forced a quick smile. “I’m fine. Just a weird week.”

Jay studied me for a second. He wasn’t a prying type, but he wasn’t blind either. Eventually, he nodded.

“Well, don’t stay too late. I’ll leave the lights on this floor for another hour. Lock up when you’re done.”

“Thanks, Jay.”

He gave me one last look before walking off, footsteps echoing down the hallway, fading into the quiet. Then the elevator chimed and he was gone.

But I stayed.

I had to.

I’ve never been the kind of person who falls behind. Never needed reminders or make-up work or sympathy. But now, everything felt off-kilter—like my life had shifted a few degrees sideways. Sleep-deprived days. Lingering fear. Memories crawling back that weren’t mine, or maybe were.

I needed to get back to normal.

Before the dreams.
Before the whispers and shadows.
Before the word cult stopped sounding absurd.

So I worked. I buried myself in numbers, forms, claim notes. I let the structure of it cradle me like rails on a track. If I just kept moving forward, maybe I wouldn’t fall apart.

The rest of the office dimmed slowly. Lights clicked off section by section. Chairs sat empty. Cubicles like grave markers.

The building was nearly silent, save for the occasional hum of the air vents cycling stale air through the ducts. Fluorescent lights buzzed low above me as I finished typing my final notes—sharp clicks echoing louder than they should in the empty space. Everyone had gone home. No printer whirring, no phones ringing, no footsteps on the carpeted floor.

The insurance office felt wrong after hours.

Cold.

Deserted.

Rows of cubicles stretched ahead like abandoned cages—computer monitors blank, chairs turned in slightly different angles, water bottles left half-full on desks like forgotten offerings. The breakroom, visible through the frosted glass wall, sat dark except for the red light on the microwave clock, blinking 6:42… 6:43… over and over like a pulse.

I shut down my computer, gathered my things, and stood slowly. The silence pressed in on my ears. The kind of silence that wasn’t empty—but watchful. Like the building was holding its breath.

I stepped into the hallway, lights flickering in soft clusters above. Most were off completely now, casting the carpet in long stretches of shadow broken only by faint, yellow-tinted emergency lights along the walls.

That’s when I saw it.

At the very end of the corridor.

A figure.

Motionless. Standing beneath the dim glow of the exit sign.

It wasn’t doing anything—just existing. The shape of a person, tall, shoulders slightly hunched forward, arms at its sides. Too far to make out a face. No sound. No breath. Just the presence of someone—or something—that shouldn’t be there.

I froze. For a heartbeat, I couldn’t tell if I was fully awake.

Was this another dream?

My feet started forward before I made the decision to move, almost like I’d been pulled. One cautious step. Another.

Then—
My phone rang.

Sharp and sudden, vibrating in my coat pocket with a high, electronic trill.

I startled, my eyes flicking down to the glowing screen.

Lanie.

And when I looked back up…

The figure was gone.

Just shadows and empty carpet now. A faint creak in the air vents. The exit sign still blinking, steady and innocent. But the hallway was empty.

I swallowed hard and answered the call. “Hello?”

“Hey,” Lanie said, voice warm but quiet. “Everything okay? I’ve texted a few times.”

I glanced at my notifications. Five unread messages.

“Sorry,” I murmured. “Work got crazy. I stayed late to catch up. I think I just need to get home and crash.”

“You sure?” she asked. “You sound… weird. I mean, more than usual.”

I tried to laugh. It came out thin.

“Want to get dinner?” she offered. “Or—I could come over. I make a killer grilled cheese when I’m trying to impress people.”

The thought of going home alone—of walking into my apartment, locking the door behind me, and sitting in that too-still silence—felt unbearable.

“Yeah,” I said. “Actually… that sounds really nice.”

“On my way,” she said without hesitation. “You like tomato soup?”

“I do now.”

We hung up.

I stood there a moment longer, still staring down the hallway.

There was nothing there.

Nothing at all.

And yet, as I turned toward the elevator, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d almost seen something I wasn’t supposed to.

That I’d almost gotten too close.

walls breathing
furniture wrong moved

the hallway kept going.
too long for this building
too long for any building
it bent. it breathed.

why was the wallpaper bleeding
or was it just—
just red.

letters
scrawled across the seams—
“You were always meant for this.”
no no no
that’s not mine
i didn’t write that
i didn’t write that

someone behind the wall
knew my name
whispered it like
like a prayer or a punishment

don’t open the third door
don’t look at their faces
don’t look at their faces
DON’T LOOK AT THEIR FACES

Lanie
Lanie was there
but not her
not the real her
the version with no mouth
just eyes
dark dark dark

she tried to speak
but her teeth were bleeding
and when she reached for me
her hands were burned

she keeps pulling away
won’t answer my calls

not since i asked about the white room

she’s scared
she knows something’s changing
i’m changing
maybe she already knew

she said i was lucky to forget
but what if
what if she’s the one who made me forget?
what if she brought me back on purpose?

did she come to find me—
or to finish what they started?

they came in threes

she’s lying
or protecting me
or using me
i don’t know anymore

they said i was the one
i don’t want it
i don’t want it

i don’t want it i don’t want it i don’t want it

chapter eight 
The Pulling

The days bleed.

They don’t pass normally anymore—they seep, smudge, overlap. I wake up unsure what day it is, what time it’s supposed to be, what I was doing before the world turned sideways again.

Yesterday, I walked to work with two mismatched shoes. One boot, one sneaker.

I didn’t notice until I sat down at my desk.

Everything feels like that now. Close to right, but off. Warped. Like I’ve slipped into a copy of my life and can’t find the edges to tear through.

At work, I stare at screens that change without my input. I answer emails twice. Sometimes three times. Once, I found an entire document in my drafts—written in my voice but not mine. It was about “the reckoning” and “the return” and “balance through the third.” I deleted it. Emptied the trash. But it still shows up in my recent files. Every day. Like it’s waiting for me.

And Jay—my boss—has started watching me more closely. The kind of glances you try to pretend you don’t notice.

It was late in the afternoon when he finally stopped by my desk.

I was halfway through editing the same paragraph for the fourth time. I think I kept rearranging the same three words, convinced something wasn’t right. I didn’t even notice him standing there until he cleared his throat.

“Emily.”

I looked up too fast, blinking like I’d just been caught stealing.

“Hey, Jay. I’m just… finishing up a few things.”

He looked at me for a long moment. Not annoyed. Not angry. Just… concerned. That made it worse somehow.

“You’ve been here late every night this week,” he said.

I gave a weak smile. “Just trying to catch up is all.”

He nodded slowly, but his eyes didn’t leave mine. I realized, too late, that I probably looked like hell. Pale. Sleep-deprived. My clothes wrinkled, my hair pulled back with little care.

“Emily,” he said carefully, “I need you to take a few days off.”

I frowned. “I’m fine.”

“You’re not,” he said gently, but firmly. “Take the time. Get some rest. Recharge.”

“I don’t need—”

Jay held up a hand. “It’s not a request. It’s a requirement. Just a few days. You’ll still get paid. Use your PTO time.”

I sat back, blinking. I didn’t know what to say. My chest tightened. I hated the idea of stepping away—of being alone for longer than I already was.

“I’m okay,” I tried again. “Really.”

“You’re exhausted. And honestly? You’re starting to scare people a little.”

The words landed hard. They weren’t cruel, but they were honest.

“I’m not firing you, Emily. I’m just asking you to take care of yourself.”

I swallowed hard and nodded, slowly. “Okay.”

“Good.” He exhaled. “You’ll be better for it.”

I didn’t believe him.

That night, I went home and stared at the ceiling until the shadows moved. I didn’t sleep. I didn’t even try. I called Lanie instead.

Her voice on the other end of the line was soft. Thin.

“Hello?”

“Can I come over?” I asked. “Please?”

A pause.

Then: “Yeah. Yeah, of course.”

Her apartment used to feel warm—jungle plants, incense, thrifted mugs. A little chaotic, but safe.

Now? Now it’s empty in all the wrong places.

The air smelled sour and sweet, like vanilla rotting. The blinds were drawn tight, the walls dim. Most of her plants were dying—slumped in their pots, leaves spotted and brittle. I hadn’t even realized how quiet it was until I stepped inside. No kettle. No hum of music. Just the low sound of her pacing.

She was pale. Her eyes were darker than usual—shadowed. There was something on her sleeve, dried and rust-colored.

“Lanie,” I said, my voice already trembling, “talk to me.”

She kept pacing, mumbling something under her breath.

And then—barely above a whisper:

“They want you back.”

My stomach dropped.

I stood frozen for a second too long, the words ringing in my ears like a bell.

“…What did you just say?” I whispered.

She turned to me, startled, eyes wide like I’d slapped her.

“I didn’t say anything,” she said quickly. “Emmy… are you okay?”

“You did,” I said. “You said they want me back.”

“No. I swear I didn’t. You’re just… you’re tired. You’ve been dreaming again, haven’t you?”

I stared at her, something creeping into my chest that I didn’t have a name for.

“I’m not dreaming when I’m awake.”

She looked away.

“You’ve been remembering things that didn’t happen,” she said. “The stories I told you—they’re leaking in.”

“No,” I said. “That’s not it. I know these things.”

“You need rest,” she said again. “You need to stop digging.”

“I think I already did. I think this is what was buried.”

She said nothing.

But her silence said everything.

And when I finally fell asleep that night—

I didn’t dream.
I remembered.

The woods.
The circle.
The white robes.
The crying child.
My hands.
The bowl.
The phrase—

“You were always meant for this.”

The words tumbled out of my mouth like a prayer I’d said before.

And I knew the child.
I knew her.

And when I woke up,
the dirt on my sheets told me I’d brought something back with me.

And I wasn’t sure I was ever going to sleep again.


Chapter Nine
the unrecognizable 

I didn’t mean to fall asleep again.
One moment I was sitting on the edge of the bed, blinking too slow, Lanie’s soft voice drifting from the kitchen — and the next, everything was gone. Time folded in on itself. The air shifted.
When I opened my eyes, it was quiet.
Too quiet.
No hum from the fridge. No traffic outside. Just stillness, like the whole apartment was holding its breath.
Then—
“Emmy?” A hand touched my shoulder. Warm, firm. “Hey, sleepyhead.”
I jerked upright.
Lanie stood over me, eyes soft, holding a chipped black mug in one hand.
“You okay?” she asked. “Didn’t mean to scare you. I just brought you some coffee.”
My heart was racing, skin clammy against the sheets. “What time is it?”
“A little after ten.”
“Morning?”
She smiled. “Yeah. You slept like the dead.”
My throat was dry. “I didn’t mean to. I was just resting my eyes.”
“You always say that,” she teased, handing me the mug. “You fall asleep like a cat in a sunbeam. Blink and you’re gone.”
I stared into the coffee. It was dark and fragrant, a soft swirl of cream curling through it like smoke. Something about it felt… off. But I didn’t say that.
Lanie sat at the edge of the bed beside me, tucking one leg beneath her.
“You dream?” she asked gently.
I hesitated. “I think so. But I don’t remember what.”
“Maybe that’s for the best.”
I looked over at her, unsure. “Why would that be better?”
Lanie’s smile was faint, distant. “Some dreams aren’t dreams. They’re pieces. Fragments trying to float to the surface. And sometimes it’s better to let them stay buried. Until you’re ready.
When I finally stood and looked at the bed again, I froze.
The dirt was gone.
Not smeared. Not scattered. Not shifted around like someone had tried to clean it. Gone. Completely.
The sheets were smooth and pale, tucked perfectly beneath the mattress.
I stared, breath caught in my throat. My pulse thudded at my temples.
Lanie followed my gaze. “What is it?”
“There was dirt,” I said quietly. “Right there. Under the covers. When I woke up last night.”
She blinked. “Dirt?”
I nodded. “Dark. Like soil. And it smelled like—like outside. Like rot.”
Lanie moved closer. “Are you sure?”
“Yes.” My voice cracked. “I touched it. I felt it.”
She looked at the bed, then back at me, her expression unreadable. “Emmy… there’s nothing there now.”
“I know,” I said. “But it was. I swear—”
“You were exhausted last night. You could’ve been dreaming with your eyes open. You’ve done that before.”
“I’m not—” I stopped myself, fists clenched at my sides. “I’m not imagining things.”
Lanie reached for my hand. “I didn’t say you were.”
“But you think I made it up.”
“No,” she said, squeezing gently. “I think your mind is trying to show you something, and maybe you’re not ready to see the whole thing yet. That doesn’t mean it’s not real.”
I pulled my hand back. “I hate that. I hate not knowing what’s real.”
“I know you do.”
“I feel like I’m going crazy.”
“You’re not.”
I sat back down on the bed, rubbing my face. “I just want to trust what I see. What I remember.”
She was quiet for a moment, then said softly, “What if what you remember… isn’t the whole truth?”
Later, in the bathroom, I stared into the mirror again.
The skin beneath my eyes looked even darker now, as if the sleep had only made me more tired. The bruise on my neck was still there. Fainter than before. But real.
I reached up and touched it.
The moment I did, something flickered. A voice — soft and cold — brushed the edge of my memory:
“Three for balance. One for fire.”
My knees nearly gave out.
I didn’t tell Lanie.
Not about the bruise. Or the voice. Or the reflection that seemed a half-second too slow.
She handed me a second mug of tea when I came back out, a rich red color this time. Steam drifted lazily upward.
“Chamomile,” she said. “You’ve been tense.”
“I’m fine.”
“Emmy,” she said, tilting her head, “you don’t have to act okay for me. You never have.”
“I’m fine.” But my fingers trembled around the handle.
We sat on the couch. The TV was on, low volume, some old movie playing in the background. I wasn’t really watching. My eyes kept drifting toward the coat closet.
There was a padlock on it now.
Had that been there yesterday?
“You cold?” Lanie asked, brushing a strand of hair from my face.
I shook my head. “No.”
“You’re quiet.”
“I’m tired.”
She leaned her head on my shoulder. “Do you remember the first time we talked?”
I paused. “At the coffee shop.”
“Yeah, but do you remember it? What I was wearing? What you said?”
I frowned. “You were in black. I think.”
“Everyone wears black in the fall,” she said gently.
I tried again. “You made me a drink I didn’t order. Told me it was something I needed.”
“That part’s true,” she said, smiling faintly. “You didn’t even question it.”
“I should have.”
Lanie sat up a little straighter. “Do you trust me, Emily?”
The question caught me off guard.
“I don’t know.”
“That’s honest.”
“Do you trust me?”
“Of course,” she said. “I think you just don’t trust yourself yet. But you will.”
Later that night, after Lanie stepped outside to make a call, I returned to the bathroom.
I locked the door behind me.
The mark on my neck was darker now. A ring of bruised skin. And at the center — not just an indentation, but a shape.
A circle, with a line through it. Familiar in a way that made my stomach turn.
I leaned closer.
This time, my reflection smiled at me.
And I didn’t.

Chapter Ten
Research

I left that night.
I didn’t say much — just told Lanie I needed air, that I’d sleep better in my own bed. She looked like she wanted to argue, to follow, maybe even to hold onto me for a second longer.
But she didn’t.
She just stood in the doorway as I walked down the hall, arms folded across her chest, the light from her apartment pooling behind her like a stage.
“Text me when you get there,” she said.
I nodded.
I didn’t look back.
The streets were quiet. The air heavy, still clinging to the warmth of the day. My shoes echoed on the sidewalk as I walked, and the shadows between the buildings seemed deeper than usual.
I kept glancing over my shoulder, unsure what I expected to see.
Something.
Someone.
But there was nothing.
Just me and my reflection in dark windows.
And the mark on my neck.
When I stepped into my apartment, the first thing I did was lock the door. Then I locked it again.
The silence inside hit harder than I expected. It wasn’t peaceful. It was hollow.
Like the apartment hadn’t missed me.
Like it barely remembered I lived there.
I flipped on the lights. Everything was exactly how I left it. My worn-out sneakers by the door. A dish in the sink. The lamp still flickering slightly from a bad bulb.
But it all felt off.
I ran a hand through my hair and dropped onto the couch, notebook in my lap. I opened to the last page I’d written and stared.
the dirt wasn’t real
reflection blinked late
voice: three for balance, one for fire
ask lanie if they ever mark people
And under that, scribbled in darker ink:
the dreams started after lanie told me about the restoration
I stared at that last line, heart thudding.
It was true. Before she told me about the cult, I hadn’t dreamed anything.
No strange symbols.
No black soil.
No marks on my skin.
What if knowing wasn’t the problem?
What if remembering was?
Sleep didn’t come easy.
I kept the light on. Laid in bed fully dressed, notebook beside me, pen clutched in my fist.
But no dreams came. Just the hum of the refrigerator through the wall and the phantom echo of my own heartbeat.
By the time the sun cracked the horizon, I already knew what I was going to do.
At 8:34 AM, I texted Lanie:

you busy? -E
never for you - L
what’s going on? -L
i want to look into the restoration -E
meet me at the library. 11. -E
okay -L
you sure? -L
no -E
come anyway -E

We met outside the old brick library near the river.
Lanie was already waiting when I got there, perched on the steps in an oversized hoodie and ripped jeans, hair tied up in a messy bun. She looked younger somehow, like the version of her that first handed me a coffee I didn’t ask for.
“You’re up early,” she said, standing.
“I never really went to sleep.”
“Same.”
We didn’t say much as we walked inside.
The library was cold and quiet, the kind of place that smelled like damp paper and forgotten time. It took a while to get access to the archive room, but once we were in, it felt like a different world — yellowed newspaper clippings, dusty microfiche reels, and stacks of uncatalogued local history books.
Lanie took the digital end — computers and public records. I started on the physical files, scanning for any mention of The Restoration.
Most of it was garbage. Ghost stories. Message board rants from the late ‘90s. Articles too vague to lead anywhere. But then Lanie appeared behind me with a few printouts in her hands.
“I found something,” she said, sliding a page onto the table.
A newspaper scan. Local paper. Dated 1998.
LOCAL FARM RAIDED — AUTHORITIES REMOVE THREE CHILDREN FROM ‘ISOLATED SPIRITUAL COMMUNITY’
I sat up straighter.
Lanie tapped the margin. “Edgehill. It’s a tiny town. Hour west of here.”
I read the piece.
The article described a “rural religious collective” — no name mentioned, but language eerily similar to what Lanie had told me: group rituals, third-child births, forced seclusion, education through scripture only.
And one line buried in the second paragraph:
“…local residents referred to the group as ‘The Restoration.’”
My blood went cold.
“They’re real,” I whispered.
“I told you,” Lanie said softly.
I looked up at her. “That’s where your mother was from?”
She nodded once.
“I thought they all disappeared.”
“They did,” she said. “But not before leaving pieces behind.”
We kept going.
As the afternoon wore on, we found more.
Mentions in old fringe magazines. A burned pamphlet scanned onto a conspiracy blog. And finally, a grainy photo of a carved wooden sign half-covered by moss:
THE RESTORATION HOUSE OF LIGHT
Below it, etched into the wood, was a strange symbol.
A circle split by a vertical line.
I felt my fingers drift to my neck.
Lanie noticed.
“They called it the Binding Mark,” she said. “Anyone marked was considered… part of the prophecy. A vessel. Or a key.”
“A key to what?”
She didn’t answer. Not right away.
When she finally spoke, her voice was low. Almost afraid.
“Not everyone was meant to live through it.”
I stared down at the symbol. The grainy photo. The circle.
And the line.
Same shape.
Same spot.
Same pressure on my skin, right at the base of my throat.
“Lanie,” I said slowly, “how did they mark people?”
She didn’t flinch.
“They waited until you couldn’t fight it. Until you were asleep. Or worse.”
The library light flickered above us. A bulb buzzed. Somewhere down the aisle, a cart creaked slowly along the floor — but no one was there.
I swallowed hard.
“Then we keep going,” I said.
Lanie’s eyes searched mine. “Even if you don’t like what you find?”
“I have to find it.”

Chapter Eleven  
coming together 

The librarian gave me a look when I brought the stack to the counter — books on fringe religions, historical cults, symbolism in rural America. One even had a hand-drawn circle with a line through it on the spine.
I didn’t care. I checked them out, stuffed them into my tote, and followed Lanie out the door.
We didn’t talk much on the way to the car. Something about what we’d seen — the articles, the mark, that word vessel — had left both of us quiet.
“Text me if you find anything else,” Lanie said, hand on the door.
“I will.”
“You okay?”
I nodded. But I wasn’t sure if it was true.
Back at my apartment, I kicked off my shoes and dumped the books onto the coffee table. The apartment was too quiet again, the air too still. I left the door unlocked this time, not because I felt safe — but because I didn’t want to be trapped.
I flipped through one of the books at random, something about Appalachian cults and messianic offshoots. Pages crinkled under my fingers, dry and yellowed at the edges. I scanned words without absorbing them.
Third-born. Ritual fire. Devotion. Cleansing.
The same phrases repeated, always with slight variations, like the meaning kept shifting just out of reach.
Eventually, my head started to nod.
I didn’t mean to fall asleep.
The dream didn’t feel like a dream.
It began with silence.
But not the peaceful kind — the kind right before something awful happens.
I stood in a clearing. My feet were bare, buried ankle-deep in dark, cold mud. The trees loomed unnaturally tall, bark blackened and pulsing like breathing skin. The sky overhead was a mess of ash and bruised clouds, swirling without wind.
A massive fire blazed in the center of the clearing, but it gave off no warmth.
Figures circled it.
All in white robes.
All facing inward.
Some wore animal masks — crude and snarling: deer, fox, wolf, horse — stretched tight over human faces, stitched with red thread. One of them turned slightly, and I saw a human mouth underneath the snout, wide and grinning, teeth filed to sharp points.
Their movements were jerky.
Too fast, then too slow.
Like time was folding in on itself.
The fire crackled, and from within it came a sound like screaming children — but in reverse.
The figures began to chant. Words I didn’t understand, yet somehow recognized. The syllables twisted inside my ears, sticky and wet, like they weren’t meant for mouths.
In the center of the circle stood a little girl.
Barefoot. Red-haired.
It was me.
Maybe eight years old.
Eyes glassy. Skin pale. Blank-faced.
She didn’t look afraid.
She looked empty.
Two of the masked figures stepped forward — holding a burlap sack that writhed like something was trapped inside. They opened it and pulled out what looked like a rabbit. Then a chicken. Then something I couldn’t name.
Each one was laid at the child’s feet. Still alive. Still twitching.
Blood pooled in the dirt.
Then the chanting stopped.
The leader stepped forward — hooded, face fully covered. Taller than the others. In one hand, he held a branding iron.
The same symbol.
A circle.
A vertical line through the center.
It glowed orange. Hissed like a snake.
I tried to scream, but my voice was gone. My feet were frozen.
The man approached the child — me — and lifted the iron.
“You are the third,” he said in a voice that vibrated through the bones in my chest.
“You are the key.”
He pressed the brand to the child’s throat.
A violent sizzle, a flash of blinding light — and then she turned.
The younger version of me looked straight at me.
Her eyes were hollow.
“You let them do this,” she whispered. “You watched.”
The shadows behind the figures exploded outward — black limbs, too many eyes, open mouths gasping silently — and the entire circle collapsed inward.
Into fire.
Into me.
I jolted awake with a full-body gasp.
My shirt was soaked. My arms were trembling.
The book I’d been reading had fallen to the floor, splayed open on a section about ritual markings in backwoods communities. But something was different.
There was writing in the margin.
Handwritten.
“Restoration Grounds – Route 12, Edgehill. Past the old sawmill. Turn where the fence is broken.”
The ink was smudged. Uneven. Not printed.
And it looked like my handwriting.
But I hadn’t written it.
Not while I was awake.
I stared at it, the letters almost pulsing on the page. A buzzing sound crawled inside my ears.
Something was pulling me.
I didn’t hesitate.
The drive was quiet.
The sky had gone fully black by the time I passed the edge of town. The road stretched into nothing — long, cracked pavement that narrowed the deeper I went.
The sawmill came up on the right — collapsed roof, windows gone. A massive fence, twisted and half-swallowed by trees, stood just beyond.
There was a break in the wire.
Exactly where the book said.
No lights. No birds. No wind.

Chapter Twelve
Arriving 

The road narrowed the deeper I went.
First pavement. Then gravel. Then dirt. My tires crunched over broken stones and fallen leaves, the trees closing in on either side like they were slowly swallowing the road whole.
Fog crept in from nowhere, thick and low. My headlights barely cut through it. The darkness beyond was absolute.
My phone buzzed in the passenger seat.
Lanie.
I didn’t answer.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Pause.
Buzz.
I clenched the steering wheel tighter, my knuckles pale. I didn’t want to hear her voice. Not yet. Not while everything in me was being pulled forward like a rope tied to something just out of view.
Something waiting.
The wind shifted. My ears popped like the elevation had changed. The forest grew silent.
Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.
Lanie.
Again.
Finally, I picked up the phone and turned it over, ready to silence it for good.
But then I saw the text:
“Please Emily. Pick up. Please don’t go there.”
My chest tightened. I stared at the screen as the dirt road curved, trees warping in my peripheral vision. I didn’t slow down.
Another call came in.
I let it ring twice. Then pressed accept.
Held the phone to my ear.
Said nothing.
“Emily?” Lanie’s voice cracked on the second syllable. “Are you—where are you?”
Silence stretched between us like a frayed wire.
“I found it,” I said finally. My voice sounded distant. Not like me.
Lanie inhaled sharply. “No. No, Emily, please. Please tell me you’re not there.”
“I found the address in the book.”
“You—You read it? That wasn’t meant for you, Emmy, you weren’t supposed to go alone—” Her words came fast, tangled with panic.
“I needed to see it. I needed to know.”
“No, you don’t. You think you do, but you don’t understand. You don’t remember.”
I pulled the car to a stop just past a crumbling wooden post. A gate long fallen. The trees here were bent unnaturally. The grass had died in strange shapes — spirals, perfect circles, like the ground itself had been scorched by meaning.
“I’m here,” I said.
On the other end, Lanie made a sound. A sharp, broken sob that punched straight through the speaker.
“Please come back,” she whispered. “Please, Emily. I should’ve told you more, I didn’t think it would start again—”
I opened the car door. Cold air rushed in, smelling of damp soil and old smoke.
“What do you mean start again?”
Lanie was crying now. Full, raw, helpless. “You don’t remember what they did to you. What you were. You think this started when I told you—but it didn’t. It started when you were born. You were part of them, Emmy. You were one of them.”
My whole body went still.
“I can’t let you go back in there,” she said. “It’ll take you. It’ll finish what it started.”
I looked past the trees.
There was something up ahead.
A path.
A clearing.
The dream came rushing back in flashes—hooded figures, firelight, the brand—
My younger self looking at me with hollow eyes.
“You let them do this.”
“I have to know,” I whispered.
“No—Emily, wait—”
I ended the call.
Slipped the phone into my pocket.
And stepped into the dark.

Chapter Thirteen
The Restoration Grounds

The path narrowed the farther I walked.
Weeds grew in thick snarls that pulled at my jeans, thorns dragging against my ankles like fingers. The trees leaned unnaturally inward, their branches gnarled into twisted shapes, some split open like wounds. Moss coated their trunks, thick and spongy under my touch, and in the quiet, I could hear water dripping from leaf to leaf — slow, rhythmic, like a clock counting down.
There was no wind.
No birds. No insects.
Only silence.
And the feeling of being watched.
I stepped over a sun-bleached bone — something small, animal, maybe — and didn’t let myself look too long. Every instinct in me screamed to turn back, but I kept walking.
The trees broke open like a seam being torn, and I stepped into the clearing.
The earth was wrong here.
A wide field stretched out before me, but it wasn’t overgrown like the forest — it was barren. Dead. The soil was pale, grayish, almost ashy, and split open in deep cracks like it hadn’t seen water in years. No grass. No weeds. No sound.
Just emptiness.
Like something had scoured this place clean.
In the distance stood the remains of a structure — what must have once been the cult’s gathering place. It was larger than I expected. A rectangular chapel, tall and narrow, but completely decayed. The roof had caved in on one side, exposing the ribcage of rafters inside. Its wooden slats were waterlogged and warped, the white paint peeling like skin from a sunburn.
A crude cross still hung over the door, but it was crooked, the nails rusted to nothing. One shutter banged slowly against the siding, even though there was no breeze.
To the left of the building was a stone circle, just like the one in my dream. Seven flat stones arranged in a near-perfect ring, the center scorched black. Bits of melted wax pooled at the base of one. Ash stained the edges.
Behind it, scattered throughout the field like a forest of warnings, were rows of wooden stakes. Hundreds of them. Some broken. Some upright. A few still had rope tied near the top, knotted and frayed, swinging slightly as though disturbed by breath rather than wind.
To the right of the chapel, there was what might once have been a garden — but now it was a lifeless grid. Neatly divided plots of nothing. The earth too hard to have grown anything in years. No flowers. No crops. Just dry, sunken rectangles full of dust.
And it was all… quiet.
Too quiet.
The kind of silence that feels hollow. Empty. Like it’s been manufactured — not a lack of sound, but the removal of it.
I took a step forward.
Then another.
The air felt heavier here. Charged. Like the moment before a lightning strike.
Something rustled behind me.
I turned — fast.
A figure sprinted from the tree line.
I didn’t move.
Couldn’t.
The person — if it was a person — ran straight toward me, barefoot and frantic. Their robes hung off their frame like soaked cloth, streaked with dirt and blood. Their skin was gray, almost translucent in the light, and their mouth hung open but made no sound.
They stopped inches from me.
Too close.
The figure stared deep into my eyes, wide and unblinking.
His irises were clouded over, like cataracts — but still alert, like he could see through me. He smelled of rot and smoke. Like something unearthed.
He raised a trembling finger.
And pointed directly at my throat.
I froze.
Pain exploded beneath my jaw — sharp, instant, searing like a brand pressed to skin. My hand flew up, grasping at my neck. But there was no wound I could feel.
Just pain.
It bloomed outward like fire. My legs gave out.
I hit the ground hard, knees digging into the cracked earth. Dust rose in a small plume around me. The man just stood there, still pointing, head tilting slightly like he was studying a specimen.
And then he smiled.
It was wrong. Crooked. Lips splitting at the corners.
I gasped. The air felt thick, impossible to swallow.
I looked up at the sky — and realized the clouds weren’t moving. Nothing was. It was like time had stopped.
My vision blurred.
The chapel pulsed in the corner of my eye, the way things do in dreams right before they collapse into nightmares.
And then—
Darkness took me.
Like a curtain being drawn.

Journal Entry 

November 25, 2018   
Emily Harper

I’ve never been very good at describing myself.
It always feels like I’m talking about someone else—someone I used to know, or maybe someone I made up.
The way you might recall a dream you’re not sure you actually had.
Familiar in flashes. Gone the moment you try too hard to hold on.

I have red hair. Auburn, really.
It catches the light when the sun hits just right—burnished copper in summer, deeper and darker in the colder months, like rusted metal left out in the rain.
Most days, I wear it up. Twisted into a loose knot or pulled back with a tie I keep around my wrist.
It’s not about style. It’s habit.
Out of the way, out of mind.
Something about letting it fall around my shoulders feels too exposed, too… noticeable.

My skin is pale—almost translucent in some light.
I freckle easily. Always have.
There’s a scatter of them across my nose, my cheeks, the tops of my shoulders. I used to hate them.
When I was younger, I tried to scrub them away with lemon juice, like someone told me once in a magazine.
Now they feel like old ink blots.
Faint stains from a summer I don’t remember, like someone else lived it for me and left their proof behind.

I’m not very tall. Not very anything, really.
Just small in that way that makes people lower their voice around me, like I might break if they speak too loudly.
I don’t wear makeup. Not because I have anything against it—I just never learned how.
It always felt like painting over a face I don’t recognize.

I wear soft clothes.
Muted colors, nothing bright.
Cardigans with stretched cuffs, jeans that have been washed too many times, shoes that don’t make noise when I walk.
I like layers. They feel safe, like armor disguised as comfort.
I gravitate toward the kinds of things that blend into the background. The kinds of things that don’t ask to be noticed.

My eyes are a pale gray-blue.
Some days they look lighter.
Some days they look hollow.
I’ve caught my own reflection before and felt a split second of alarm—
like seeing a stranger mimic me from the other side of the glass.

People think I’m quiet. Polite.
Some call it calm.
Some call it soft.
But I think it’s just a stillness I’ve learned to live inside.
Like water in a glass held very still, afraid to spill.

There are parts of me I know I’ve lost.
Whole stretches of time that feel thin and worn, like an old bedsheet rubbed nearly transparent.
I’ve forgotten things.
Not little things—
Big things.
Pieces of who I was. What I felt. What happened.

So I write things down.

Not just important things like bills or deadlines or birthdays.
Everything.
What I wore. What I ate.
What I dreamed.
What song was playing when I woke up.
The shape of the clouds on my walk to work.
How I felt when I saw her—
Lanie.
Even if I’m afraid to admit it.

Because if I don’t write it down, it fades.
Some days feel like they never happened at all.
I can go back through my journals and see whole afternoons I wouldn’t remember otherwise.
I can track how the light changes in my apartment from month to month.
I can remember that I smiled, once, at something small.
Even if I don’t know why anymore.

There’s so much I’ve already lost.
Not just memories, but versions of myself.
Like I’ve been a hundred different girls,
and each one disappeared quietly when no one was looking.

Sometimes I wonder if trauma can do that.
If fear is strong enough to erase.
If guilt can hollow you out without you realizing it—
until all that’s left is routine.
A structure you’ve built like scaffolding just to keep standing.

I work in an insurance office.
Third cubicle from the window. Gray walls. Beige carpet.
Soft clicking of keys, low conversations behind glass.
I don’t hate it.
It gives me something to hold onto.
A reason to wake up, to move through the day.
A place where no one asks too many questions.
No one even calls me Emily unless they have to.
Mostly I’m just “her”—the quiet girl who’s always on time,
who eats the same lunch every day,
who never forgets to refill the printer paper tray.

That’s the way I like it.
Predictable. Safe.
Clean lines. Clear steps.

I built my life like that—
little routines that hold me together,
the same way I hold the pages of this notebook in my lap.

Every morning, I write before I leave for work.
Even just a few sentences.
Sometimes more.
It helps me feel real.
Grounded.
Here.

Because if I don’t, I drift.
And if I drift too far, I don’t know if I’ll find my way back.



chapter two
The beginning of the end 

It was early autumn, and the town was still tucked beneath the hush of morning. The pavement glistened with dew, fallen leaves pressed flat and dark across the sidewalk like ink stains. A soft mist hovered just above the ground, clinging to the spaces between buildings, and the air carried that unmistakable crispness that only comes at the start of the season. The sun had just begun to rise—low and golden, barely stretching over the rooftops—casting a warm, sleepy light that made everything feel softer, quieter.

I walked the same path I always did, passing shuttered storefronts and quiet windows. The town was still waking up, and I liked it best that way. Peaceful. Predictable.

The coffee shop sat on the corner of Willow and 3rd, snug between an old bookstore and a closed-down barber shop. Its red brick exterior was worn with time, ivy creeping up the side like it was trying to pull the place back into the earth. The wooden sign above the door creaked when the wind hit it just right, and the windows were always fogged on the inside this time of year, blurring the soft yellow glow within.

Even before stepping inside, the scent pulled me in—roasted espresso, vanilla, and the faintest trace of something sweet and spiced, like cinnamon sugar on warm bread. It wrapped around me like a memory I couldn’t place.

Inside, the warmth greeted me instantly. The walls were lined with old wood shelves filled with mismatched mugs and little potted plants. A couple of round tables sat near the front window, and the faint hum of indie music buzzed under the soft hiss of steaming milk. The bell above the door gave its familiar chime, and there she was.

Lanie.

Always behind the counter, like she belonged there. Same soft features, same bright smile—the kind that made you feel seen. I always matched it without thinking, like a reflex.

“One large mocha with two shots of espresso,” she said, already sliding the cup toward me.

I couldn’t help the smile tugging at my lips. “You know me so well.”

She laughed lightly. “You know, you’ve been coming in here for about two years now, every single day… and I still don’t know your name.”

That caught me off guard. Not because she asked—but because she was right. We’d gone all this time without actually speaking beyond orders and smiles. Maybe we were both too shy. Or maybe we’d just fallen into a rhythm neither of us wanted to disturb.

“Well,” I said, laughing softly, “I guess it never really came up.”

“My name’s Emily. Emily Harper. But my friends call me Emmy.”

“Nice to officially meet you, Emily,” she said, her voice light, playful. She handed me my cup, her fingers brushing mine in the smallest, softest way.

As I reached for it, something caught my eye—writing on the side of the cup, just above the logo.

Before I could read it, she added, almost too casually, “That’ll be $3.50.”

Still a little distracted, I handed her the cash and dropped the change in the tip jar without thinking.

“Thanks,” I said, stepping out into the cool air again. The breeze was crisper now, and I tucked the cup into both hands, letting the warmth seep into my fingers.

As I took my first sip, my eyes drifted back to the cup.

There it was, written in neat black ink, just under my name:

Here’s my number, 246.496.6729. Call me sometime :)

I stopped walking for a moment.

Then smiled.

For a moment, the rest of the world faded—the passing cars, the shifting wind, even the distant sound of someone unlocking a nearby storefront. All I could hear was my own heartbeat in my ears, like the sudden rush of water filling a quiet room.

I stared at the cup, blinking once, then again, just to make sure I wasn’t imagining it. The steam curled lazily from the lid, catching the light like a veil.

It felt like such a small thing. Ink on a paper cup. But somehow, it shifted something in me.

I turned back toward the shop instinctively, half-expecting to catch one last glimpse of her through the window. And there she was—Lanie—already moving behind the counter, but she looked up. Our eyes met for just a second. She gave a shy, knowing smile, and then turned away.

The moment broke, and I kept walking. My fingers tightened around the cup like it might float away if I let go.

I should’ve felt confident. Flattered, even. But instead, I felt… unsure. Nervous in a way I hadn’t been in years. She had always felt safe to me—a warm smile, a steady presence in the blur of routine. This was something else entirely.  
  


chapter two
The Blackout

I didn’t call Lanie that first night.

I thought about it—more than once.
The urge would rise in quiet waves, catching me off guard.
When I was brushing my teeth. When I was staring into the fridge, unsure if I was hungry. When I was lying in bed with the phone beside me, her number glowing soft and silent in the dark.

But I never pressed call.
The number sat in my contacts like a trapdoor—one that once opened, couldn’t be shut again. Just seeing it made my chest tighten.

Instead, I floated through the next few days in that hazy space between want and fear.
I’d unlock my phone, thumb hovering over her name.
Once, I even typed out a message—“Hey, are you around?”—but deleted it before I finished the sentence.
I kept telling myself: tomorrow.
Then: maybe the next day.

But still—I went back to the café.

Of course I did.

And there she was.
Always there, behind the counter, sleeves rolled to her elbows, her dark hair pulled back messily, like she’d forgotten she was beautiful.
That same soft smile that made the world seem quieter.
Those eyes that watched more than they let on.

But something had changed between us.
There was a gravity now.
A silent pull, like we were standing at opposite ends of a thread no one else could see.

On the third day, I broke the silence.

“I still have your number, you know,” I said casually, like I hadn’t rehearsed it five different ways in my head.

Her eyes lit up. “I was starting to think I scared you off.”

I smiled, though it didn’t quite reach. “Not scared.”

“Then call me.”

Her voice was light, but something underneath it felt weighted. Like it mattered.

So I did.
Later that night.
And again the next day.
And again after that.

It started with texts.
Small, harmless things.
What are you doing?
Have you ever tried that Thai place on Main?
This song made me think of you.

Then it became calls.
Then meetups.
Then routines that didn’t feel like routines.

Late walks through neighborhoods we didn’t belong to.
Laughing over street art and garbage bins and the way dogs looked at us like we were secrets.
A thrift store afternoon that turned into hours of flipping through old records and paperbacks with cracked spines.
She teased me about the notebooks I kept in my bag. I told her I needed them. She didn’t press.

Lanie made the world feel lighter.
But she also made it tilt in ways I didn’t expect.

One night, while we were sharing fries from a paper tray outside a gas station, she asked me, “What’s your earliest memory?”

I opened my mouth to answer.
Nothing came.

“I don’t know,” I said finally, embarrassed. “That’s weird. I guess I’ve never thought about it.”

She was quiet for a second.
Then: “Mine’s of a forest. But it didn’t feel real. The trees were too still. Like they were watching.”

I looked at her. “That’s… eerie.”

“I know,” she said, smiling. “But it felt like home. In a way.”

She said it like a joke. But it didn’t feel like one.

A week later, we met at an old bookstore downtown.
Rain streaked down the fogged windows, and the air inside smelled like dust, paper, and time.
We wandered aimlessly through the aisles, speaking in whispers, fingers brushing over old covers and faded titles.

Lanie stopped at a shelf in the very back.
Pulled out a book with a cracked black spine.

“Have you ever read The Ones We Forgot?”

I shook my head.

“It’s about a woman who starts remembering things that never happened to her. Lives that aren’t hers. But they feel like they are.”

I stared at the cover: a house drawn in sketchy lines, all the windows black—except for one, faintly glowing.

“That sounds…” I hesitated. “Familiar.”

She tilted her head, watching me. “Yeah. I thought it might.”

There was something sharp in my chest then. Not pain, exactly.
Recognition.
Like I’d seen that house before.
Like I’d stood behind that glowing window.

“I get those sometimes,” I murmured. “Little flashes. Not quite memories. More like… echoes.”

Lanie didn’t say anything.
Just reached out and squeezed my hand.

And for a second, I wanted to pull away—not because it felt wrong, but because it felt known. Too known.

A few nights later, Lanie came over.

It was the first time I’d let her see my apartment.
I don’t invite people in.
Not because I’m unfriendly—but because my space is sacred.
Structured.
Safe.

It’s a third-floor walk-up above an old hardware store that smells like nails and turpentine. The stairs creak. The hallway hums with fluorescent buzz. But inside—it’s quiet.

Neutral walls. Pale, soft light.
Furniture that serves its purpose. No clutter. No color.
Everything has its place.
A photograph of a mountain I’ve never climbed.
A stack of notebooks by the window, arranged by size and date.
A candle I never light.
A couch I never nap on.

Lanie looked around, and for a moment, I saw it through her eyes.
Spare. Clinical. Maybe even a little lonely.

But she didn’t say any of that.
She just smiled and held up the wine.

We sat on the couch with a movie playing low in the background. She brought caramel popcorn in a crinkled plastic bag and laughed through the dumbest scenes. I didn’t. I couldn’t seem to focus.

At one point, I felt her eyes on me.

“What?” I asked.

“You looked… different just now.”

“Different how?”

“Like you were somewhere else.”

I blinked. “Maybe I was.”

Lanie leaned her head back against the cushion, watching me from the side. “Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you’d just… turned left instead of right one day?”

I swallowed. “I don’t really like to think about that.”

“But you do.”

Again, that tone.
Not judgment. Just certainty.

And again—I didn’t answer.

Something about her felt like a mirror I wasn’t ready to look into.

A long silence settled. The kind that fills the room with questions neither of us asked.

Then she shifted.

“I should go,” she said, already rising.

“You don’t have to.”

“I know,” she said, her voice small.

I followed her to the door.

She paused before leaving.
Turned to look at me.

“Thanks for letting me in.”

It sounded heavier than it should’ve.

Then she walked out into the hallway.
Her boots echoed all the way down the stairs.

Later that night I woke up on the floor.

The hardwood was cold against my cheek.
My hands were curled beneath me like I’d braced for impact.

The microwave clock blinked: 3:11 a.m.
The TV was on—but nothing played. Just static, humming faintly.

I sat up slowly, body aching.
I couldn’t remember falling asleep.
I couldn’t remember going to bed.

But I had been dreaming. I was sure of it.

The images slipped away the moment I opened my eyes—but one stuck.

A long white hallway.
Windowless.
Endless.
The air was thick, muffled.
And gouged into the wall at uneven intervals—
The number 9.
Carved again and again like someone had done it with shaking hands.

I stood, dazed.
The fridge beeped.
The lamps blinked back on.
All the digital clocks reset.

The power had gone out.

I walked to the window.

Across the street, the café was dark.

Except for one light glowing from the back—
the office, I think.
The room I’d never seen inside.

It stayed on, steady and soft.

Like someone had never left.

Like someone was waiting.
Or watching.
Or remembering. 



chapter three
Patterns

I woke up already dressed.

Jeans creased, shirt bunched at the waist like I had tossed and turned in it all night. My notebook lay open on the floor beside the bed, pen still tucked in the spiral. I must have been writing before I fell asleep.

There was only one line on the page:

ask lanie abt the dream

I stared at it, the letters uneven like I’d written them in a hurry—or half-asleep. I didn’t remember writing it. I didn’t remember dreaming either. 
I shut the notebook and sat on the edge of the bed, letting my feet touch the floor for a long time before I stood up. Something felt… off. Not wrong, just shifted. Like the room had been moved an inch to the left while I wasn’t looking.

Outside, the sky was washed in that pale blue haze that always came just before a storm. The air was warm but unsettled. I kept thinking I could smell rain, though nothing had fallen yet.

The café sat like a steady fixture on the corner—same soft light, same chipped wood sign, same rustling of newspaper pages and ceramic mugs clinking together. I went there every morning because it was predictable. Because I didn’t have to think about anything once I stepped through the door.

Lanie was already behind the counter, wiping the espresso machine down with a towel slung over her shoulder. She glanced up the second I walked in. Her expression was neutral but familiar, like she’d seen this version of me before.

“Morning,” she said, her voice smooth but careful. “You okay?”

“I think so,” I said, but it sounded like a question.

She didn’t push. “The usual?”

I nodded, and she turned without another word.

I took my seat by the window, notebook still in hand. I didn’t open it yet. Just sat there watching the light shift across the table, tracing the steam that curled from a stranger’s cup two seats down. My own drink arrived minutes later—warm, sweet, grounding.

When Lanie placed the cup in front of me, she didn’t walk away. Instead, she hesitated like she wanted to say something, then slid into the seat across from me.

“You look like you didn’t sleep,” she said.

I smiled faintly. “I don’t remember.”

That made her eyebrows lift, just slightly. She didn’t speak, but I felt the shift between us. Like I’d confirmed something she’d already suspected.

I flipped open my notebook, turned it toward her, and tapped the single line.
ask lanie about the dream

Her face didn’t change much, but her shoulders stiffened just enough for me to notice.

“I don’t remember writing it,” I said. “Or dreaming.”

Lanie leaned back in the chair, studying me with a softness that didn’t quite hide her caution.

“Sometimes we remember the feeling before we remember the details,” she said.

“Have I said anything before?” I asked. “About a dream?”

She hesitated. Then: “Not with words.”

That made my stomach tighten. “What does that mean?”

Lanie glanced toward the window, then back at me.

“It means your body knows things your mind hasn’t caught up to yet.”

I looked down at the notebook again. The handwriting was definitely mine. And yet, it felt like a stranger had written it.

“Was it… a bad dream?” I asked.

She didn’t answer right away. Then, quietly:
“I think it was something you needed to see again.”

My heart tapped against my ribs, too light to be a full panic, too loud to ignore.

I wrapped my hands around the cup, holding onto the heat like it could anchor me.

“Will it come back?” I asked.

Lanie’s voice was gentler this time. “Only if you’re ready.”

When I stepped outside, the air had shifted. A breeze kicked up, thick with the scent of wet concrete. The clouds had rolled in without warning, sudden and heavy.

I started walking home, one hand still wrapped around the now-empty cup.

As I passed a shuttered storefront, something caught my eye in the reflection of the glass. Not my face, but behind it—
a flash of red fabric, and the silhouette of a child’s hand pressed to a fogged window.

I turned sharply.

There was no one there.

But my heart was racing. My palms were damp. And I could hear something, faint and sharp in my ears:

A lullaby.
Soft. Crooked. Half-familiar.
And suddenly, I could smell fire.



chapter four
The restoration 

The rain came just after sunset.
Not a storm, just a steady fall that soaked the streets and blurred the glow of traffic lights outside my window. It was the kind of rain that quiets everything else, the kind that makes you feel like the world has been gently placed on pause.

I hadn’t turned on the lights. I didn’t need them. I sat curled up on the couch, my notebook open in my lap but untouched since this morning. The words were still there, circled once in shaky pen:

ask lanie about the dream

I still didn’t remember writing it. Still didn’t remember dreaming anything at all. But I remembered showing her. I remembered the way Lanie looked at me after she read it—something between recognition and concern. Like she’d been holding something back until I was ready to ask.

A soft knock pulled me from my thoughts. Three quiet taps.

I stood and walked slowly to the door. When I looked through the peephole, I wasn’t surprised to see her standing there.

Lanie.

Rain in her hair, arms crossed like she was holding herself together.

I opened the door.

“Hey,” she said, voice warm but cautious. “I know it’s late. I wasn’t sure if I should come, but… after this morning, I figured maybe it would help.

“It’s okay,” I said. “I’m glad you’re here.”

The rain had quieted by the time Lanie came.

Not stopped — just softened. Like the world was holding its breath.

She stood in the doorway in her oversized hoodie, her hair damp and clinging to her cheeks. I stepped aside to let her in.

The room was dim, glowing faintly from the streetlight outside. We sat on the couch, the silence between us thick but not uncomfortable.

I held my notebook loosely in my lap, open to the page she’d seen that morning at the café.

ask lanie about the dream

She looked at it again but didn’t smile this time. Her expression was solemn. Present.

“I wasn’t sure I should come,” she said after a while, voice low. “But if it were me… I think I’d want someone to tell me the truth. Even if it hurt.”

I nodded.

Lanie sat back, hands clasped in her lap like she needed to ground herself.

“I was raised in a place called The Restoration,” she said. “It wasn’t a church. Not exactly. But they talked about God like they’d met Him personally. Like He whispered rules to them in the dark.”

She exhaled slowly.

“They had rules. Dozens of them. But their core belief was that every third child born was a curse. That every third life tipped the balance toward destruction. So they had a system. A brutal, unwavering rule.”

I didn’t speak. I couldn’t.

“They called it the Balance Doctrine. Every third child had to be removed. For the ‘good of the world.’ They didn’t call it killing. They said it was cleansing. Purifying. A holy offering.”

Lanie’s voice didn’t rise. It didn’t need to. The calmness made it worse.

“I had a sister,” she said. “Her name was Miriam. She was born just after midnight. We were a family of  three for twenty minutes.”

I watched her eyes go somewhere far away.

“I remember my mother holding her. Still bleeding, still shaking. My dad wasn’t even allowed in the room. It was just her, and me watching from the hallway. Miriam was tiny — red-faced, wrapped in the only blanket we weren’t supposed to use. My mom hummed to her. Sang the way mothers do when no one’s listening.”

Her voice went softer.

“Then they came. The same night. Dressed in white robes. Heads covered. Holding lanterns that glowed an ominous red color.  They didn’t ask. They didn’t wait. They took her from my mother’s arms while she was still crying into the sheets.”

My throat burned. My whole body had gone cold.

“They didn’t do it quickly,” she whispered. “That would’ve been mercy. They had a ritual. I won’t tell you all of it. But I watched. I was standing on the stairs.”

Her eyes looked glassy, distant.

“She didn’t scream. My mom. She never screamed. That was one of the rules. Crying was weakness. Pain was sacred. You had to feel it, not express it. And if you broke that—if you made a sound—you were punished.”

I swallowed hard. “Punished how?”

Lanie looked down at her hands, turning her thumbs over each other.

“You weren’t allowed to speak during daylight unless granted permission. You couldn’t show emotion unless it was joy. Even that could be punished if it looked unnatural.”

Her voice was steady, but there was something brittle underneath it. Like a thin sheet of ice over a frozen lake.

“If you broke a rule—even something small—they sent you to The Silence Room. It was underground. No windows. No sound. You’d go in barefoot, wearing just a white linen shift. You’d stay there until they said you’d learned your lesson.”

She paused.

Sometimes days. Sometimes longer. They fed you water through a slot in the floor—just enough to keep you alive, never enough to feel human. They didn’t let you sleep. If you tried, they’d blast recordings through the walls—crying, screaming, alarms that spiked at random intervals until you couldn’t tell if they were real or inside your skull. The darkness was total—so complete it felt alive. Your eyes would ache from trying to find shapes in the black. You started seeing things that weren’t there. Smells, too. Burning plastic. Rotting meat. Your own skin.
Time stopped making sense. Hunger twisted into nausea, then into a kind of hollow buzzing in your bones. Your body ate itself in slow degrees. Muscles shook. Your thoughts scattered. Some people screamed. Others went quiet, too quiet. One girl bit off part of her own finger—just to feel something. Another went mute for six months. One boy laughed so hard he broke his own teeth. And sometimes you’d think you heard someone whispering right next to you, but no one was there. You were never touched—but it always felt like something was waiting in the dark, breathing behind your ear.
My chest ached just listening.

“They didn’t believe in love,” Lanie continued. “Said it made you selfish. If two people got too close, they’d separate them. Make them forget. Erase their names from each other.”

She looked at me then.

“One day, my mother was just… gone. No goodbye. No explanation. They said I’d become too dependent. That meant they wiped her. Gave her a new name. A new purpose. Maybe a new child to raise. Or maybe they locked her away and told her to forget me.”

A long silence.

“And the worst part?” Her voice dropped. “After a while… you start to believe them. That you deserve it. That it’s your fault. That you were born wrong.”

My hands were trembling.

Lanie’s eyes met mine — not accusing, not pitying. Just knowing.

“I don’t remember any of this,” I whispered. “Not for me. Nothing like that.”

She gave a small, sad smile.

“I didn’t either,” she said. “Not at first. For years, I thought I had a vivid imagination. I’d get flashes. Smells. Words I didn’t understand. I’d wake up screaming from dreams I couldn’t explain.”

I looked down at my notebook. At the empty margins. At the line I’d written that morning, like some part of me already knew.

ask lanie about the dream

Lanie leaned closer.

“I told you this because I see something in you, Emily. The way you watch everything. The way you remember so little, but feel so much. That’s what it felt like. That’s what it still feels like.”

My throat was tight. My whole body felt like it was vibrating, but I couldn’t tell from what. Fear? Grief? Recognition?

“I’m not saying it’s the same,” Lanie said. “But something happened to you. And whatever it is… you don’t have to go through it alone.”

She reached across the couch and gently took my hand.

“I can’t promise it won’t hurt,” she said. “But I can promise I won’t leave you in it.”

I didn’t speak.

But I didn’t pull away either.

Outside, the rain started again—soft, steady, quiet as breath.

And for the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel completely alone.



chapter five
Dream Logic

After she told me everything—the robes, the rituals, the baby taken bleeding from her mother’s arms—Lanie went quiet.

She just sat there on the edge of the couch, staring at her hands. Not crying. Just gone, like she’d crawled deep inside herself and shut the door behind her.

“They burned the third child’s name,” she said finally. “So no one could speak it again. Like it erased the soul.”

I couldn’t find any words. I felt like I’d swallowed broken glass.

“You can stay here tonight,” I said, my voice too thin, too normal.

She nodded. “Please.”

I gave her a blanket, a shirt of mine to sleep in, and left the lamp on. She didn’t ask for that, but I think we both knew she wouldn’t sleep if the dark took the room completely.

I lay in bed for a long time, staring at the ceiling. Listening. I couldn’t tell if it was Lanie’s breathing I heard… or something else.

Eventually, sleep took me.

I was in the hallway again. My hallway. But longer. Warped.

The walls pulsed like lungs, like something was breathing just beneath the drywall. A deep, wet inhale. A slower, strained exhale.

My bedroom door was closed.

Something was behind it.

I reached for the handle. My hand was shaking. I turned it.

Inside, the room was dark. Too dark. The shadows were thick, solid, curling like vines along the ceiling.

Someone was lying in my bed. On their side. Hair the color of dried blood spilled across the pillow.

Me.

My body. Still and small and peaceful. My lips moved, whispering something. I leaned in.

“Don’t wake up,” I said. “It’s worse when you wake up.”

The voice wasn’t mine.

The walls peeled open like wet paper. Suddenly I was outside. On a street swallowed by fog.

A traffic light blinked red above me—slow, rhythmic, like a heartbeat.

Figures appeared in the distance. Gliding. No footsteps. White robes dragging on the concrete, sopping with something thick and black. Their faces hidden by veils of stained linen.

“You let her in,” they said.
“You let her in.”
“You let her in.”

I turned to run. But the fog pulled at my legs, thick like syrup. Something sharp scraped across the pavement behind me.

A child’s cry echoed through the air—wet and sudden, cut off mid-scream.

I spun around—

Lanie was standing in the road.

But she wasn’t Lanie.

Her face was cracked down the center like shattered porcelain. Her eyes were hollow, pupils stretching outward into black spirals. Her fingers twitched unnaturally. One arm too long. Her mouth opened—jaw unhinging.

“You were supposed to die,” she whispered. “You were the third.”

Her smile was a wound. Her teeth—there were too many.

I screamed—


And woke up.

Sweating. Cold. My sheets soaked. My heart sprinting.

I sat up, hands gripping the edge of the mattress. Tried to breathe.

A dream. Just a dream.

The apartment was quiet. My room was still.

I got out of bed and opened the door slowly.

The lamp in the living room was still on.

Lanie was sitting on the couch. Back straight. Perfectly still.

“Lanie?” I whispered.

She didn’t respond.

I stepped closer. She wasn’t blinking. Her eyes were locked on the wall across from her, wide and wet and shining.

“Lanie?”

She turned her head. Not like a person. Like a marionette. One single jerk of the neck. Her face slack.

“There are three of you now,” she said. Her voice layered—hers and something beneath it, something old and rotted. “Only one can stay.”

Her mouth stretched wide, and something started pushing out of it—long, gray, wet.

I stumbled back.

And then the walls screamed.

Not figuratively. They screamed—a thousand voices layered into one shrieking wail. Paint peeled, lights exploded in bursts of sparks. The apartment bled.

I turned to run—but the hallway folded like paper, collapsing into itself. Lanie stood in the doorway, her hands burning, her skin sloughing off like wax.

“You were never out,” she said. “You only think you woke up.”


I jolted awake.

The real kind. I think.

My mouth was dry. My heart thundered. The room was dark, normal-dark. The ceiling didn’t breathe.

But I didn’t move. Not right away.

Finally, I opened my bedroom door.

Lanie was still there—on the couch, asleep, arms wrapped around herself.

Quiet. Human.

But I couldn’t stop staring at her face.

Because in the dream… her eyes had looked exactly the same.

And part of me still wasn’t sure I was awake.


chapter six 
Not Really Awake


The smell of coffee pulled me out of the fog.

Weak sunlight crept through the window above the sink, casting long, dusty streaks across the hardwood floor. For a second, I didn’t know where I was—then the sound of the percolating coffee pot brought it back. My apartment. Morning. Real.

Lanie stood at the counter, barefoot, wearing one of my old oversized sleep shirts—the faded navy one with the stretched neckline and frayed hem. It fell just above her knees, the sleeves too long, nearly swallowing her hands. Her black hair was a tousled mess, but the two blonde streaks in the front framed her face in soft curls, catching the morning light like ribbons of gold.

She looked calm. Too calm.

Her posture was loose, comfortable. Her expression was soft. She stirred sugar into her mug with the kind of ease that belonged to someone who felt safe. Her presence filled the kitchen like it belonged there.

Not like the thing I saw in my dream.

Not like the creature with spiral-black eyes and too many teeth.

When she looked up, her eyes were their normal color. Just hazel. Tired, maybe. But warm.

“You didn’t sleep,” she said, already pouring a second mug. Her voice was steady. Normal.

I tried to laugh it off, but it came out dry. “Was it that obvious?”

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I took the coffee and sat at the edge of the couch. My hands trembled slightly, but the ceramic was warm and solid. It helped.

Lanie leaned back against the counter, one foot tucked behind the other. She wore my shirt like it was hers, like it had always been hers. I tried to shake off the feeling of dread curling in my stomach, but it clung to me like humidity.

“You ever have a dream that just… won’t let go?” I asked.

She raised an eyebrow. “Let me guess. I was in it?”

I nodded slowly. “It was more like… you were and you weren’t. You looked like you, but you said things—awful things. That I was part of them. That I was the third.”

Lanie’s smile faded. She looked down at her cup, then back at me. Her expression had gone still.

“Dreams like that… they don’t just come from nowhere,” she said. “Sometimes your brain’s trying to piece things together before you’re ready.”

“You think I’m remembering something?” I asked, my voice lower now. “Something real?”

“I think,” she said carefully, “that your brain knows more than it lets on.”

We sat in silence for a long moment. The only sound was the quiet clink of her spoon against the ceramic.

Then she glanced up at the clock.

“Shit,” she muttered. “I’m gonna be late.”

“For work?”

She nodded, already turning toward the hallway. “Yeah. My shift starts at nine. Do you think I could borrow something to wear? I wasn’t really planning on crashing here.”

“Of course.” I stood too fast, almost spilling my coffee.

Lanie tilted her head slightly. “You okay?”

“Yeah. Just still… off.”

I ducked into my bedroom and grabbed a pair of jeans I thought might fit her, plus one of my favorite cardigans—a soft, oversized gray one, worn at the sleeves. Something about offering it to her felt strangely intimate, like giving away a piece of myself.

When I handed her the clothes, her smile returned—soft and sincere.

“Thanks,” she said, running a thumb over the edge of the cardigan. “You really didn’t have to.”

“I wanted to,” I said, and meant it. “It’ll look good on you.”

She nodded and padded down the hall to the bathroom.

The door clicked shut behind her.

I stood in the silence she left behind and watched the way the morning light stretched across the carpet. I should’ve felt comforted.

But instead, I stared at the spot she’d been standing and couldn’t shake the feeling that part of the dream was still here—waiting, just behind her eyes.

About 20 minutes later I got ready like I always do.

Shower. Brush teeth. Moisturizer. Light swipe of nude lip balm. No makeup—never. I kept my look simple, natural. My clothes were soft, neutral tones—beige blouse, tan trousers—something to blend in, not stand out. Shoes lined up exactly where they belong by the front door. I moved through the motions like muscle memory, but it all felt just a second off. Like someone had rearranged the script behind my back.

I left ten minutes later than usual.

The walk to work was the same path I always took, but the streets felt unfamiliar—like I was walking through a city built to look like mine. The stoplights seemed to flicker at the edges. The crosswalk sign glitched for a second, then reset itself.

My office building loomed ahead, sterile and beige and familiar. I walked through the automatic doors, smiled weakly at the receptionist, and tried to pretend everything was fine.

But it wasn’t.

I was behind from the second I sat down at my desk. My emails were already piling up. I forgot to flag a client request. I snapped at someone who asked for help with a printer jam—me, who always kept her cool. My fingers trembled on the keyboard. I misread reports. Missed calls. Forwarded the wrong spreadsheet.

Around noon, the message popped up on my screen:

Jay wants to see you. When you get a sec.

My stomach dropped.

I stood, legs slightly unsteady, and walked down the hallway toward his office. His door was open.

He smiled when he saw me. “Hey, Em. Come in. Shut the door?”

That was worse than the message.

I obeyed and sat in the chair across from his desk.

Jay folded his hands on top of a stack of files. “You okay?”

“I—yeah. Just a rough night.”

“You’re usually the most reliable person on this floor,” he said gently. “But today’s… not like you.”

I looked down at my hands. They were clenched in my lap, knuckles white.

“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to mess anything up.”

“You didn’t mess up,” he said quickly. “You’re just… not here. Mentally. That’s not a crime. But I need to ask—are you okay? Really?”

I opened my mouth to lie, but something in his tone stopped me. It wasn’t judgment. It was concern. Real concern.

“I think I’m just… overwhelmed,” I said. “Something personal. It’s been—hard to shake.”

Jay nodded. “Take a little time to breathe. Catch up when you can. Let me know if you need anything. Okay?”

I nodded, grateful and embarrassed all at once.

Back at my desk, I stared at my screen.

There were no robed figures. No voices. No spiraling black eyes.

Just Excel. And an inbox full of unread emails.

Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very, very wrong.

And that whatever it was… it had followed me.

The government could claw back $2.2 billion a year from “wealthy” pensioners by lowering pension asset tests by $100,000 and a further $3 billion a year by lifting the rate used to estimate the income people earn on their assets, a leading economic adviser to the government says.

Modelling by the Australian National University for *The Australian Financial Review* also showed taxpayers are paying about $4 billion a year in payments to people living in homes worth more than $1.5 million, including $1.8 billion to people living in homes worth more than $2 million.



Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek was informed that some seniors are claiming the pension although they are building up inheritances for their offspring. **Bethany Rae**

Labor has no plans to include the family home in the pension asset test, but is open to ideas ahead of Treasurer Jim Chalmers’ economic roundtable later this month to fix the structural deficit plaguing the budget bottom line.

One area for reform is who gets the pension, said ANU Associate Professor Ben Phillips, who conducted the modelling and is also a member of Labor’s advisory committee on economic inclusion.

“The Australian welfare system is largely designed to help those who can’t or have limited ability to help themselves. But the age pension currently directs several billion a year to households who are not in that group,” he said.

The Department of Social Services earlier this year warned its incoming minister, Tanya Plibersek, that [wealthy seniors were claiming the pension while also building additional wealth for inheritances](https://archive.md/o/8MjCt/https:/www.afr.com/politics/federal/plibersek-warned-over-wealthy-pensioners-20250724-p5mhet) rather than merely paying for retirement.

DSS’ brief said the current system meant low- and middle-income taxpayers were “subsidising the retirement incomes of seniors with significant wealth in addition to their homes”.

It noted under the assets test and deeming rates that a partial pension “continues to be payable to couples with income of almost $100,000 a year or assets of almost $1.05 million, in addition to their principal home of unlimited value”.

Phillips, who is principal research fellow at the ANU’s Centre for Social Research and Methods, said while the age pension was modest at around $575 per week for a single person, it was also lightly means-tested.

“There is a cohort on the age pension who may have relatively modest incomes with relatively high living standards as their wealth is high and their housing costs low,” he said. “This cohort tends to have very low rates of financial stress, typically much lower than employed persons.”

Lowering the pension asset tests by $100,000 would primarily affect people in the top two wealth quantiles. Of the $2.2 billion a year the change would raise, $2.01 billion comes from these two cohorts, Phillips’ modelling shows.

**Deeming rates and RBA cash rate since 2011**

The situation is similar for increasing deeming rates in line with the Reserve Bank of Australia’s official cash rate. Of the $2.97 billion a year that would be raised by lifting deeming rates 3.75 percentage points higher, $2.17 billion would come from the top two wealth groups.

Deeming rates are used to estimate the amount of income people earn from financial assets. They feed into means testing for social security payments, including the Centrelink age pension, JobSeeker and parenting payments.

When the rate is increased, it is equivalent to saying the pensioner is earning [more on their private assets and therefore needs less welfare support](https://archive.md/o/8MjCt/https:/www.afr.com/wealth/personal-finance/pensioners-face-income-hit-as-cost-of-living-soars-20240318-p5fd8z).

In the 20 years before 2022, deeming rates largely followed the central bank cash rate. As the RBA slashed rates to an emergency level of 0.1 per cent in 2020, deeming rates followed lower.

But when rates began rising sharply in May 2022 – to 4.35 per cent by late 2023 – [deeming rates were left on hold](https://archive.md/o/8MjCt/https:/www.afr.com/politics/federal/deeming-cliff-looms-for-850k-aged-pensioners-welfare-recipients-20240505-p5fp0k) in what was framed as a cost-of-living measure. If the rates were returned to their long-term levels in line with the cash rate, welfare recipients would have their payments cut, but the federal budget bottom line would be billions of dollars better off.

“The deeming rate was lowered considerably when interest rates were at emergency low rates during COVID. But with interest rates now back to normal levels, better reflecting the returns on financial assets today, it makes sense to increase those rates,” Phillips said.

“Increasing the deeming rate and tightening the asset test is one of the few areas of the welfare system where genuine budget savings can be made without doing much harm.”

Of the 900,105 people who receive government welfare and have income from other sources, about 460,000 are aged pensioners, while 143,000 are on JobSeeker payments, and a further 120,000 are on parenting payments.

1mit1gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Estheticians/comments/1mit1gn/how_do_i_hire_an_experienced_esthetician/,How do I hire an experienced esthetician?!,"I work at a Spa in Alberta Canada and we have RMT's and estheticians. We have been open for a little under a year and experienced estheticians are ridiculously hard to find or professional ones.

I have made posts on social media, have an opening on our website and have called around to beauty schools. We offer yearly raises, health benefits, flexible hours, personalized advertising and discounts in Spa. We want someone who didnt just graduate from their esthetics program and has some experience. So now my question is: 

What am I doing wrong? Are we asking too much? Not offering enough?

The Spa owner wants me to start googling and finding people I would like to come work for us (I do have a few people in mind) and book appointments at their current workplace and talk to them about positions or arrange for coffee's/meetings but this is a smaller city and poaching gets around fast and feels a bit sketchy? And seems like it would give us a bad name. 

But at the same time messaging people on socials or sharing our posts with them seems like the only idea I can come up with?? 

Our current esthetician (we have one who's been with us from the start) doesn't think thats the right way to go either but I dont know how else to entice people to even apply for the position.

How would you like to be approached as an esthetician? Where do you look for job openings? Any advice you can give is super helpful! Thank you!

1mit1cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eutychus/comments/1mit1cd/the_stanley_miller_origin_of_life_experiment_from/,The Stanley Miller Origin of Life Experiment from 1952: Part 2,"Darwin certainly has not lost his place in the subset of science that is origin-of-life, but every subset needs its own tee shirt and coffee mug star. That honor falls to Stanley Miller, who in 1952 created a few amino acids in the lab among contrived conditions and thereafter held firm that such conditions must have prevailed in primordial earth—otherwise his findings could not have happened. If that seems like somewhat circular reasoning, consider that Dr. Hazen says as much: “Most previous origin researchers have fallen into a kind of trial-and-error approach to devising hypotheses; they would cook up some likely geochemical recipe and run an experiment. If the experiment did something interesting, they patched together a theory around those observations.”

Well—surely the field’s own “Darwin” didn’t do this. Yes, even he: “Stanley Miller’s experiment is a case in point. The Miller-Urey experiment produced amino acids, so his followers became convinced that that’s how it happened long ago in nature.” In fact, what he did was not even new. The Great Courses professor tells of another scientist who did exactly the same thing fifty years earlier, Walter Loeb, a German chemist. But Loeb didn’t frame it as searching for life’s origin; he just said he was mixing chemicals. Nor was he a self-promoter. Moreover, he was German, and in the years immediately following the World Wars, nobody wanted to hear anything from Germany. So they just find something that works and say, ‘Ha! Early earth must have been that way! Otherwise, my experiment would have flopped!’ It is not exactly rigorous science, most neutral parties would conclude. So typical is this slipshod guesswork passing for science that when someone comes along who actually details his work, it’s a big deal! “You don’t mind if I brag a little,” Gunter Wachtershauser says many years later, “but something like this has never been done in the entire field.” It hasn’t?! All he did was provide “more than 100 pages of specific chemical reactions. Each of these reactions is a testable step.” Aren’t they all supposed to do that? Instead, they just spin guesses and gullible atheists lap it all up as ‘science!’ “We’re going to take a much closer look at Gunter Wachtershauser’s theory in lecture 20,” Dr. Hazen says, and when he does, he finds other things not to like, but at least Wachtershauser did what you would think all scientists would do.

So, Stanley Miller is top dog, the Darwin in his field. He does not want to lose his place. Of a competing hypothesis, he mutters: “The vent hypothesis is a real loser. I don’t understand why we even have to discuss it.” The reason “we” do is that, for all the euphoria, his hypothesis has some gaping holes that sink it, Hazen points out. The early “primordial soup” is far too dilute to host steps necessary for abiogenesis. Not to mention that water, the “liquid of life,” and carbon, the “framework for all biomolecules,” don’t mix. Not to mention that certain steps essential to life never work in water at room pressure.

So, maybe some areas of high pressure are where life originated, Hazen lectures, and he considers oceanic vents where weird life has been discovered since Miller’s time. Maybe life originated there! And there are a host of researchers going in that direction. Presently, however, Hazen uncovers just as many difficulties there as with Miller’s soup. The non-scientist can get a rough idea of the troubles crushing pressure might pose to newly developing delicate life by smashing his thumb with a hammer.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)

Since both scenarios post intractable problems, many others emerge. Maybe the earliest cells formed, not in the high-pressure ocean depths nor the low-pressure primordial soup, but on some material that served as a scaffold to pin the early molecule to, and after so serving, disappeared. There is a hypothesis that maybe life emerged, not as carbon-based, but as something-else based—clay, says one, minerals, says another—and only later transitioned to carbon-based. Maybe it started silicon-based, the outer shell of silicon offering the same connections as carbon, there being only an extra shell within. Like those Star Trek aliens who bored through solid rock—not a problem if you are rock-based yourself—to attack humans who had mistaken their eggs for bowling balls or some such thing.

Look, they’re all great guys and all. I wish them well—well, I guess I don’t—but it doesn’t matter if I do or don’t. They are impossible to discourage. Every match that doesn’t burn their fingers is the one they are convinced will light the next rocket ship to Mars. (and yes, there is also a hypothesis that life originated on Mars and came here via asteroid.) Well into the course, after he has discussed hypothesis after hypothesis and found them all wanting, he doesn’t conclude what anyone of common sense would conclude—that they’re all wrong. Bizarrely, he concludes probably all of them are right, or at least worthy likelihoods, and all that is needed is further experimentation to corroborate them!

“Look, I understand it may seem a little frustrating to have so many scientific cliffhangers but by the time you’re through with this lecture series you’ll be poised to share in all the incredible discoveries that are about to come, and I absolutely guarantee there will be exciting discoveries in the quest for life’s origins!” Tell me a guy like this can be discouraged.

I used to be a computer science major, but I've since switched to **Optics and Photonic Engineering** because I've found I'm happier with physics.

Near the end of a recent 12-day war, my company disbanded due to war-related economic problems, leaving me jobless. The semester also ended, which left me feeling lonely and isolated during the summer. While I've been able to pick up some freelance projects, everything feels off. I'm tired of my country's economic and political problems.

I had started this job over a year ago to cope with a breakup, and work had become an obsession—a way to escape from life. I wouldn't leave the office until my part was done, and the sudden change in my routine caused a major depression. The worst part is that I can't even work remotely because of my country's brilliant connection with the world outside (sarcasm).

To pull myself together, I helped start a scientific society for my major. My goal is to create a space where young people can work on their projects without the usual burdens and obstacles, taking a step toward my lifelong dream. I also go to a cafe every day at 6 p.m. to work in a semi-crowded place just to be around people; the coffee and music are great.

But at the end of the day, I just want to curl up in the corner of my room. I'm exhausted from working so hard and feeling like I can't do anything for myself or others who are suffering. And when I solve a difficult physics or coding challenge, there's no one to share the joy with. Honestly, I feel useless and lost.

This had to be because of him. I didn’t know how long I had lain there, plugging my ears. I didn’t know if what I had experienced was real, a hallucination, or a dream. I knew I needed to see my client to know what he did to me. 

The digital clock on my nightstand was blinking 4:38. Useless. I checked the microwave, the oven, even the coffee machine. All blinking 4:38. I pulled my phone from my pocket. It was dead.

My whole apartment was in such a state of disarray after the previous night, I felt like I was wading through a junkyard. I searched for my watch, an old wind-up timepiece. It was sitting in the cup by the door, along with my car keys and wallet. I couldn’t remember the last time I had wound it up, but I wore it daily. It read 7:39 AM while ticking away faithfully.

Speeding out of my apartment in yesterday’s clothes, I hurriedly made my way to the parking lot. About halfway to my car, I heard footsteps coming up behind me. I quickened my pace and just as I reached for the door handle, I felt a hand on my shoulder.

I spun around, panic tightening in my throat. It was my client. We spoke at the same time:

“Can you hear it?”
“Did you follow me?”

My client repeated himself, “Th-the noise, can you hear it too?” 

Seeing my client here was almost as jarring as everything I had experienced to this point. In a flustered voice I responded, “The static?”

“Oh god, you do. You do hear it! YOU HEAR IT!” He sounded both relieved and defeated.

I cautiously shushed him after his shouts had drawn the attention of a few neighbors. I smiled nervously while waving to them as they got into their cars. When he appeared to calm down, I asked him, “How did you know that? Why didn’t you mention this in our session?”

“I didn’t know if you would believe me. I wanted to but I thought it might be too soon. I thought that I would sound crazy. Once our session was over, though, I felt like I could trust you. I wanted to talk it over with you.”

“So you followed me home,” I asked, taking a step back.

“I’m sorry, I haven’t really been thinking straight,” he said sheepishly.

“You could’ve asked for extra time,” I said. His confession had both angered and unnerved me, but I needed to stay focused.

“I wanted to talk more privately,” he said. “Off the record.”

“Listen,” I said, “I’m not doing this here. I just want to know why this is happening. Come with me to the office and we can discuss this further. I’m already running late.”

My hands were shaking as I turned the key in the ignition. My client fumbled with the seat belt before buckling himself in. I hadn’t noticed before, but with him in such close proximity, it's almost like the static had doubled. Not in volume, but like there were two separate sources.

We drove in silence for a short while. I noticed him fidgeting, playing with the ring on his index finger. He kept spinning it as he hummed quietly to himself. 
He wasn’t humming any particular tune, rather, he was matching pitch with the static and occasionally harmonizing with it.

“Why are you doing that?” I asked. I was trying to remain calm, but my trembling voice betrayed me.

“What?”

“You’re humming, does it help?”

“I’m not humming.”

“Yes, you were, just now. I heard you.” I was trying to keep my eyes on the road, but his confusion forced me to turn and look at him.

“Listen, a lot of weird shit has been happening since that car crash. I black out, I see things. Shit that can’t be real, but I know it is. You gotta help me man.”

I turned my eyes back to the road, swerving slightly to get back in my own lane.

“We’ll be lucky if I can even make it to the office,” I muttered.

I glanced at my watch as we entered the building. 8:03. At least I wasn’t going to get fired. The receptionist waved, sipping her coffee, as I flew past her with my client.

“Good mor—”

“Cancel all my sessions today,” I said hurriedly, not breaking stride. “Send everything to voicemail. I’ll deal with it later. I need total privacy.” I didn’t wait for a response.

I was practically dragging him up the stairs to my counseling space. Once at the door, I fumbled with the keypad, needing several tries before I punched it in correctly, 0438. With a satisfying beep the door unlocked. I whisked my client through the doorway and instructed him to sit down. I paced between my desk and the wall as he took a seat. I don’t know if I was making him nervous, or if it was the situation, but he sat on the edge of the chair, legs bouncing. I had a million questions for him, but the one that was burning a hole in my brain came out first, “How did you know I could hear it?”

In the silence before he answered, the static crackled, seeming to grow in intensity every time I got near him.

“I was sitting in the bus stop by your place. It was real early in the morning. All of a sudden the buzzing started rattling in my skull. It was so loud I thought I was gonna pass out, and I thought I did when everything popped.”

“Popped?”

“Yeah, it was like lightning and thunder all at once, but then it went pitch black. And everything was quiet for a while. When the lights came back on, the sound came with it. But it was different. It was like when you play two keys on a piano that are right next to each other.”

I stopped pacing, put my head in my hands and raked my fingers through my hair as I dropped into my office chair, heaving out a shaky sigh. 

“Okay, then what,” I asked in a measured tone. He was still my client and I needed to be strong for the both of us now. I couldn’t let him know just how shaken I was.

“I waited till you came out of your place. As soon as I saw you I got this real bad headache, like somebody put a snare drum in my head and started pounding. It just got louder till I got close to you. Once I got a hold of you it just sort of . . . spread out. Didn’t quite go away, but quiet enough for me to actually think.”

Thinking back on it now, I jumped both out of fear and because of the sharp crack that invaded my ears as he approached. Whatever was happening to us got stronger the closer we were to each other. That's how he knew.

“You mentioned blacking out earlier. Are your . . . visions . . . attached to these events?” 

“If they are, I don’t remember them.” I could feel myself deflate at this.

“Sometimes it seems like the world gets a little foggy. I see sparks in the corners of my eyes. It gets really bad at night when I’m alone. I haven’t had any ‘visions’ since I –,” his voice hitched a bit, “well since I died.”

A raw silence hung in the air. I let out a sigh before continuing, “Do you have any emotions attached to the blackouts? Do you have any pain?”

He shook his head, “It makes me anxious. The blackouts are so much worse than seeing or hearing shit,” he said shakily.  “I blink and I’m somewhere else. One time I was listening to music, just trying to drown out the damned buzzing. Next thing I know, I’m on the bus. No phone, no earbuds, no music. Just a headache and that freakin’ sound!” 

He looked at me for a moment, his desperate, bloodshot eyes searching for an answer in mine. He put his head in his hands. I let the moment breathe before I realized he was sobbing.

I pushed myself up and out of my chair, closing the distance between us. As I reached out to touch him on the shoulder, everything went dead silent. No static, no cars outside, not even the soft music from the lobby. It made me stop in my tracks, with my hand inches from my client.

It felt like time was stretched for a moment before hurtling forward. My stomach jolted into my throat as the taste of iron flooded my mouth. My sight seemed to fracture like glass. The hand I had stretched toward my client in a moment of comfort now grasped him for balance. When my hand made contact, he looked up at me and said, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”

A terrible wave of sonic harmonies filled my head, dissonant and deafening. I put my hands to my ears and my knees buckled. My client deflated into his chair, clutching his ears. The overhead lights brightened and I clamped my eyes shut. It wasn’t enough and the brightening lights seared into my eyelids, capillaries branching across my vision. 

Then everything popped. 

The screeching in my ears diminished to a soft hum. I opened my eyes. Broken glass was everywhere. The live wires in the overhead light crackled and arced as I noticed my now glassless window.

My client wasn’t moving, covered in shards of fluorescent lightbulb. As I rushed to him, blood oozed out of his eyes, ears and nose. I pressed my ear to his chest, listening for a heart beat or breath sounds, but I couldn’t tell over the pounding in my head. 

The hair on my forehead swayed in a slight breeze. I waited a moment, holding my breath. It happened again. He was breathing. 

Murmurs filled the hallway as I rushed to my desk phone. It was dead; no dial tone. 

“Hey, is everyone okay? We had a power surge.” I felt panic rising in my chest as I realized this incident wasn’t isolated.

“Call an ambulance,” I shouted, opening the door. “I don’t know what happened. H–he had a seizure, I think. He’s bleeding, he needs a hospital!” 

My mind was racing as I thought up a frantic excuse for why I had an unconscious, bloody client in my chair.

This is even more true for those in the service sector and working in cafes. It is in these workplaces that we begin our inquiry.”

 

**Exciting news! After a year of efforts our workers’ inquiry “Class Composition in the Cafe Sector: What do cafe workers in the United States think and do while at work?” has been published by our comrades at Notes from Below in the UK.** 

 

>“Cafes provide us with our morning coffee as well as places to gather and work. But, for workers in the service sector there are real challenges: low wages and high turnover, bullying bosses, and difficult customers. We worked through the pandemic and were called essential. We spend more time with customers and coworkers than we do with our friends and families. After our shifts, we talk with our coworkers about the good times, the hard times, and how we can improve our working lives.

> 

>Organising at your cafe is about wages, hours, and working conditions, and it’s about so much more, too. Cafe workers are organising to get a say in their workplaces; to address ‘the same, systemic problems: short staffing and unpredictable scheduling; low wages; unaffordable healthcare; harassment; broken equipment; unfair discipline’ and create unions that have the ‘directly democratic input of rank-and-file workers.’

> 

>In ‘Class Composition in the Cafe Sector’ we hope that by presenting workers’ narratives alongside our analysis of the sector, we can develop a framework for how workplaces in the sector are structured and what tensions exist within them that can aid organising for class struggle.”

Chapter Fourteen
lost one.

I woke to wetness.
Not just damp — soaked. Cold seeped into my spine through the stone beneath me, muddy and uneven. Water dripped from somewhere high above, rhythmic and hollow, like a ticking clock counting down.
My wrists were bound. My ankles, too — tight rope, rough against skin rubbed raw.
I tried to move. I couldn’t.
It was pitch black, but I knew I wasn’t alone.
I could feel them. Breathing.
Then came the first flicker of light.
Candles — faint and scattered — nestled into holes in the dirt walls like watching eyes. They cast long, flickering shadows across what looked like a tunnel carved crudely from the earth. The air was thick with mildew and rot. Something had died down here. Or was still dying.
The moment I shifted, the figures moved.
I hadn’t noticed them until then. They hadn’t made a sound.
There were dozens.
Standing silently against the walls in stained robes — hooded, faceless. Their fabric hung like old parchment, waterlogged and clinging to their thin frames. Some had symbols drawn across their chests in what looked like ash. Others… in something darker.
They didn’t speak.
They didn’t need to.
Their presence was a pressure, like the air itself was being strangled around me.
And then — they began to chant.
A low, guttural sound at first, like wind through a cave. Then louder. Sharper. Words I didn’t know but somehow recognized. Words that scraped against my brain like glass on bone. The sound filled the space, bouncing off the walls, making the candles tremble.
I whimpered. I didn’t mean to, but the sound slipped out.
One of them broke away from the wall.
They crept toward me with slow, calculated steps — not clumsy or stiff, but practiced, like they’d done this a hundred times before. Like they’d been waiting.
They knelt beside me, their face hidden beneath the hood.
I could feel their breath — wet and cold.
“Welcome back, lost one.”
The voice was genderless. Soft, almost kind — but hollow, like it had no soul behind it.
They pressed something cold against my forehead — a stone, or maybe bone. It stung. Then they stepped back.
Another figure came forward.
“Welcome back, lost one.”
Over and over.
Each one leaned in close, whispered those same words like a curse, and stepped away. By the seventh, I was trembling. By the tenth, I couldn’t breathe.
My pulse was thundering in my ears. I could barely see.
The room felt alive, breathing, pulsing, throbbing with the rhythm of the chant.
Then the final figure stepped out of the shadows.
Their robe was darker than the rest. Blackened at the sleeves. Wet at the hem.
They didn’t walk — they glided.
The others moved aside to let them pass, heads bowed.
The figure crouched down in front of me.
Their hood hung low, but I could just barely make out a mouth — wide, colorless, cracked. It didn’t move when they spoke.
The voice slithered out.
“Lanie is to blame.”
I froze.
“You must remove the threat…”
The other voices fell completely silent. Even the dripping water seemed to stop.
“…and restore the balance back to Earth.”
Their face was inches from mine now.
I could smell decay on their breath.
“Or God will be displeased…”
They reached a hand toward me — long fingers, bone-thin.
“…and punish you, Emily Harper.”
When they said my name, it felt like a nail being driven into my spine. My vision blurred. I couldn’t even scream. My voice was gone.
Then — one by one — they came back.
The robed figures surrounded me in a perfect circle.
Each knelt at my wrists.
Each pulled up my sleeve, baring skin already mottled with dirt and bruises.
Their fingers were cold, wet — they dipped them into something thick and dark red in the bowls beside them.
Blood.
Still warm.
Fresh.
They rubbed it into my skin slowly, deliberately — pressing their thumbs into the hollow of my wrists, circling, staining.
As they marked me, they began to chant again, louder this time, more frenzied. The language twisted and snapped through the air, a kind of primal rhythm, like the sound of insects skittering just beneath your skin.
The pressure in the room grew unbearable. I felt like I was being swallowed. Like the earth itself wanted me gone.
My body shook. I tried to scream. Nothing came out.
The last figure pulled away from me and raised their hands toward the dripping ceiling.
The candles blew out — every single one.
And in the instant before I lost consciousness, I heard it:
A voice that did not belong to anyone in that room.
A voice that came from inside me.
“You were never meant to leave.”
And then—
blackness.

Chapter Fifteen
“Was it real… or was I?”

I woke up staring at the ceiling.
The familiar water stain above the window.
The soft whir of the fan near the bed.
Light slanting through the blinds, catching on floating dust.
My apartment.
I sat up slowly. My sheets weren’t dirty. No bruises on my wrists. No blood.
The books were still on the table. The notebook open where I’d left it. My phone charging beside the bed. The hum of traffic outside.
Normal.
Too normal.
I moved through the space like a ghost. Everything was untouched — my mug still in the sink from two days ago, laundry still unfolded in the basket by the couch. The books I’d checked out from the library sat in a neat stack.
No candles.
No dirt.
No chanting voices.
Had I dreamed it all?
The underground chamber. The robes. The voice.
“God will be displeased.”
It rang in my skull like a warning bell.
I looked down at my hands. They didn’t shake.
But I could feel something… off.
Like my body remembered things my mind wanted to forget.
Then came the knock.
Three short raps at the door.
I didn’t move.
Then again, gentler.
“Emmy?”
Lanie’s voice.
I froze.
The name struck me like a slap. The sound of her outside the door made my stomach twist.
“It’s me… please open the door.”
Something inside me shifted.
Clicked.
Snapped into place.
Not me. Not mine. Not Emily.
The air in the room felt warped. Like the floor beneath me tilted. The warmth of sunlight meant nothing.
All I could hear were those words:
“Lanie is to blame.”
“Remove the threat.”
“Restore the balance.”
I walked to the door slowly, numb, floating.
When I opened it, Lanie rushed in like a storm, pulling her hood down, eyes wide.
“Oh thank God,” she breathed. “You’re okay.”
I said nothing.
She turned toward me. “Emmy, where the hell have you been? I—I’ve been calling nonstop. I even drove by your work just in case.” She gave a breathless little laugh. “I thought something happened to you. After the library—after what you said—I didn’t know what to think.”
Still, I said nothing.
She stepped closer, searching my face. “Are you sick? You look pale. Did something happen? Did you… remember something?”
I blinked at her slowly.
The light caught in her eyes. They looked full of worry. Love, even.
But to me, they looked like a lie.
“God will be displeased.”
“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “If I pushed you too hard. If telling you about the Restoration triggered something. I just—Emily, I thought you wanted to know the truth. I was only trying to help.”
The word help felt poisonous in my ears.
She kept talking.
“There’s something wrong with that place, I know there is. And I know you felt it too, the dreams, the—” she faltered, “—the memories, or whatever they are. But we can figure it out together. You and me. We always said that, right?”
I stared through her.
Her voice echoed like it was coming from underwater. My head throbbed.
Her hand brushed my arm gently.
“Please say something.”
My mouth opened. But it wasn’t my voice that wanted to come out.
I was stuck somewhere between two selves. One that loved her, needed her, trusted her—
—and one that knew she had to go.
The silence stretched until she whispered, “You’re scaring me.”
I tilted my head, studying her face like it belonged to someone I used to know.
I could still remember the warmth of her hands on mine. The way she smiled like she knew what I was thinking. The first time I’d seen her behind that counter at the café, humming along to some song I didn’t recognize.
But that felt like a memory that belonged to someone else now.
I wasn’t sure who I was anymore.
“Lanie is to blame.”
“You must remove the threat.”
Lanie’s brow furrowed. “Emmy?”
I looked down at her hand on my arm.
She was still touching me.
Still close.
Still here.
And I could feel it—inside me—rising.
Like something ancient had been stirred awake.
God will be displeased.
And all I could think was:
How easy it would be.

Chapter Sixteen
The body remembers what the mind denies.

“I’ll be right back,” I said softly.
My voice sounded flat. Hollow. Almost like someone else said it for me.
Lanie blinked, surprised, but nodded. “Okay. I’ll stay right here, Em.”
She smiled nervously and sat back on the couch, hugging her knees to her chest.
I turned and walked down the short hallway to my bedroom. The air felt thick, charged. Like walking underwater.
As I pushed open the door, I saw it immediately.
The knife.
It was laid across the center of my bed. Not tossed. Not dropped. Placed. Carefully.
The hilt faced me. Almost like an invitation.
It wasn’t one of my kitchen knives. I would’ve remembered one like this.
The blade was long and curved slightly, like a ritualistic sickle. Its edge was dark—too dark—and jagged like it had been forged by hand, not manufactured. Carved into the metal were symbols—tiny, etched markings that looked like the ones in the books from the library. Symbols I hadn’t been able to translate.
But somehow, I knew what they meant now.
Balance. Purity. Sacrifice.
The handle was wrapped in worn leather, stained a deep, rusted brown. Blood, I realized. Old. Years old, maybe more.
My fingers wrapped around it before I could think.
It was warm.
As though it had just been used.
And the moment I touched it, something in me went quiet. Still.
Like my mind had been pushed aside and something else had taken the wheel.
I turned and walked back toward the living room, knife gripped behind my back, hidden beneath the folds of my sweatshirt.
Lanie was still talking when I entered. Pacing slightly now, twisting her fingers together.
“I just think maybe something’s wrong. Like, seriously wrong, Emily. You haven’t been sleeping, and you’re seeing things. I know the Restoration stuff is dark, but maybe it triggered something. Like a memory or a trauma or—I don’t know.”
I didn’t speak.
She looked at me with soft eyes.
“I’m not saying you’re crazy. I’m not,” she said quickly. “I just—maybe you need help. Real help. I’ll go with you. I’ll stay with you. I love you, Em.”
That last part landed somewhere deep inside me. Buried beneath whatever had taken over.
But it wasn’t enough.
I stepped closer.
Lanie’s eyes flicked down, catching the shift in my posture. The tension. Her expression changed—concern turning into confusion. Then fear.
“Em…?”
She didn’t have time to say anything else.
The first stab landed just below her ribs.
She gasped—sharp and high-pitched—and stumbled backward into the table.
I followed.
Another stab.
And another.
And another.
Blood sprayed across my floor. Splattered up my arms. Warm. Immediate.
Lanie let out a choked sob, barely able to breathe.
I don’t know how many times I stabbed her. I didn’t count.
Only that I didn’t stop until she wasn’t moving.
Until her eyes were wide and glassy.
Until the blade stopped meeting resistance.
And then—
Silence.
Time restarted.
My hands were soaked. The knife slick. The smell of iron and bile filled the room.
Her blood was everywhere.
On me. On the floor. On her.
And she wasn’t breathing.
I stared at her body, heart pounding in my chest.
And suddenly, whatever had been inside me was gone.
Gone.
And I was back.
Truly back.
I dropped the knife and stumbled backward.
“No—no no no no—”
The words spilled from my lips like vomit.
I tripped over the rug and ran down the hallway, crashing into the bathroom and collapsing over the toilet.
My body heaved. I retched so hard I saw stars.
I couldn’t stop shaking.
When it was over, I looked up—slowly—into the mirror above the sink.
Blood on my neck.
Blood smeared across my cheek like war paint.
My eyes were wide and red-rimmed, and they didn’t look like mine. Again.
What did I do?
I pressed my hands to the sink, trying to breathe.
Tried to tell myself it wasn’t real.
Tried to tell myself it was another dream.
But the blood was real.
Lanie was real.
And now she was dead.
Because of me.
Because something told me to.
Because I listened.
Because I couldn’t stop it.
I sank to the floor, my back against the wall, hands still trembling and slick with blood.
And I cried like a child.


Chapter Seventeen
If it disappears, did it ever happen?

I don’t know how long I sat there on the bathroom floor.
Eventually the sobbing stopped.
The shaking dulled.
I could breathe again, if only just barely.
The tile was cold beneath me. The silence in the apartment was suffocating, loud in its emptiness. The kind of quiet that pressed in from all sides.
I dragged myself to my feet, swaying a little, and splashed water on my face. The sink was still running. The mirror still fogged from my panicked breath.
Blood was smeared across my shirt, my sleeves. Under my nails. Drying now.
It was real.
It had to be.
And that meant… Lanie’s body was still in the living room.
The thought almost dropped me again.
But some part of me—some buried, rational instinct—clicked on. A survival mechanism.
“You have to clean it.”
Not because it was the right thing.
Not because I wanted to.
Because something deep in me whispered: “If anyone sees this, it’s over.”
I stepped out of the bathroom, not letting myself look back toward the living room.
Down the hallway, just past the linen closet, was a narrow door. The utility closet.
I opened it with shaking hands and pulled out the bleach. A pack of old rags. A half-used bottle of carpet cleaner. Latex gloves. A trash bag.
I moved like I was sleepwalking.
Like I’d done this before.
Which terrified me more than anything.
Supplies in hand, I finally turned toward the living room.
And froze.
The blood was gone.
The body was gone.
The couch was clean. No stains on the floor. No broken lamp. No overturned table.
Just silence.
Just… normal.
Like nothing had happened at all.
I dropped the bag.
Walked slowly toward the couch.
No drag marks. No traces. Not even a stray dark spot.
The air didn’t even smell like iron anymore.
I dropped to my knees, touching the carpet where she had fallen—where I had stabbed her, over and over again.
Nothing.
My hands were clean.
I looked down at my arms.
Still clean.
The sleeves of my shirt were dry. White. Untouched.
I gasped and ran back down the hallway, flipping the bathroom light on.
No blood in the sink.
No smears on the floor.
I spun to the mirror and grabbed the edges of it.
My face was clean.
There was no blood.
No evidence.
Nothing at all.
My chest tightened.
“No, no, no. I didn’t make it up.”
I was whispering to myself now.
“She was here. She was here. I saw it. I did it. I felt it.”
I gripped the counter, knuckles white.
If she was gone—if everything was gone—then where was she?
Did someone come?
Did someone clean it up?
Or… was it never there to begin with?
Was this what madness felt like?
Was I still under their influence?
Still dreaming?
Or had I done something so horrible that my mind had simply erased it to survive?
I stumbled backward out of the bathroom, heart in my throat, ears ringing.
I looked at the front door.
Still locked.
The knife?
I turned back toward my room—but I already knew.
It was gone, too.
Not a drop of blood.
Not a sign of struggle.
Not a sound.
Just me.
Just silence.
Just that gnawing question crawling up my spine:
What is happening to me?


Chapter Eighteen
If no one remembers her… was she ever real?

I picked it up and opened my messages. Scrolled instinctively to her name.
Nothing.
The thread was gone.
No photos. No texts. No calls.
I blinked, backed out of the message app, and checked my recent calls.
Gone.
Her number wasn’t there.
Not even under the “recently deleted” section.
I scrolled faster. No voicemails. No history.
My throat tightened as I tapped out her number manually, the one I’d memorized weeks ago.
Ring.
Ring.
Then—
“You have reached an invalid number. Please check the number and try again.”
I stared at the screen, pulse pounding in my ears.
That didn’t make sense.
I had the number right.
I knew I did.
I tried texting her instead, just a single word:
“Lanie?”
A second passed. Then two.
And then:
Message Not Delivered.
I sent it again.
Same thing.
Undelivered. Gone.
I went back to the top of my contacts list.
Her name wasn’t there.
It was like she’d been erased.
Like she never existed in my phone at all.
I sat on the couch and stared at the wall, gripping my phone with both hands like it might slip away from me too.
Where did she go?
Where did my Lanie go?
The only person who ever made me feel seen.
Who didn’t talk to me like I was fragile or broken or halfway out of my mind.
She sat with me in silence when I needed it. Laughed at my awkward jokes. Gave me pieces of her past like puzzle fragments.
I knew her. I did.
She was real.
She had to be.
I grabbed my bag and keys and ran out the door.
The café was exactly as I remembered it. White-tile floor. Chalkboard menu hanging by the pastry case. The same lopsided fern by the window that was always a little too dry.
My eyes scanned the space, already knowing where she’d be—
Behind the counter. Hair pulled back.
She wasn’t there.
Just a guy with a beanie and a girl with purple hair, pouring drinks. No sign of Lanie.
I stepped up to the counter, heart hammering.
“Hi—sorry, um… is Lanie working today?”
The girl blinked at me. “Who?”
“Lanie,” I said again. “She’s usually here. Black hair, blonde streaks in the front. Kind of sarcastic? Beautiful?”
The barista glanced at the guy beside her, then back at me.
“I think you have the wrong café. No one named Lanie’s ever worked here.”
“No,” I said too quickly. “That’s not right. We’ve been here before. Together. We’ve sat at that table.” I pointed to the back corner by the window. “She always got black coffee, I got a mocha latte. We’ve talked here. Dozens of times.”
She gave me a cautious look. “Ma’am… you come in here a lot. But you’re always alone.”
The words felt like a slap.
I shook my head. “No. No, that’s not true. She was here with me. We—”
“We just thought maybe you were on the phone,” she added carefully, “or, like… talking to yourself.”
I felt my stomach drop. A cold rush of panic slid down my spine.
“You’re wrong,” I whispered. “She worked here. She was here.”
The barista’s eyes hardened. “If you don’t leave, we’ll have to call the cops.”
I didn’t remember the walk to the bookstore.
I just remember standing in front of the counter, the bell on the door still jingling behind me.
The older man behind the register looked up with a familiar tired smile.
“Hey there,” he said. “Back again already?”
I nodded stiffly. “Yeah. I was just wondering… do you remember a girl who used to come in here with me? Lanie?”
He blinked. “What?”
“Black hair, blonde streaks, leather jacket,” I said. “We used to sit by the horror section. She liked Shirley Jackson. I think you rang her up once—she bought a copy of House of Leaves.”
He frowned.
“I’m sorry, I don’t remember anyone like that. You usually come in alone. You sit on the floor by the far shelf for hours. Sometimes you hum. But I don’t remember you ever being with anyone.”
I couldn’t breathe.
The bookstore was closing in on me. The lights too bright. The walls too tight.
I turned and stumbled out the door, my vision blurring, the floor tilting beneath my feet.
Was I going crazy?
Had I made her up?
Every place we’d ever gone… every memory… all of it?
Gone.
Erased.
Like she never existed at all.

Chapter Nineteen
She’s finally awake

I was halfway down Fifth when the world tilted sideways.
One second I was walking, the next it was like the sky dropped an octave.
The streetlights flickered—buzzing so loudly it rattled my skull.
Cars froze mid-motion. Pedestrians stopped in their tracks, staring straight ahead like mannequins. A dog across the street lifted its head and let out a sharp, high-pitched howl—and then even it went still.
Everything paused.
I blinked and rubbed my eyes. Tried to breathe.
No one moved.
No one blinked.
Then the buzzing stopped—and so did my heart.
A splitting pain cracked through the center of my skull like lightning.
I stumbled. Tried to hold onto a mailbox. Missed.
And the world went black.
The room was white.
Not off-white. Not hospital white. Bleached. Blinding.
I blinked, vision hazy, pupils aching from the brightness.
The floor was smooth. Seamless. No doors. No windows. Just a single light above and the hum of something mechanical behind the walls.
I tried to sit up, but my arms felt heavy. Like I’d been drugged.
There were voices—muffled at first—whispering in a rhythm I couldn’t understand.
Then, like a needle slipping into place:
“She’s finally awake, my lord.”
I turned my head too fast. Pain lanced down my neck.
“My lord?” I rasped, voice cracked and unfamiliar.
“Where the fuck am I? Where is Lanie?”
Two figures stepped into view—clad in white from head to toe. No name tags. No expression. Their clothes looked sterile, ceremonial… not like scrubs. Like robes pretending to be medical garb.
They leaned over me, checking something by my wrist.
One of them was chanting softly, the syllables wrong—too many consonants. The other moved her fingers in slow circles above my skin like she was drawing symbols in the air.
I tried to pull my arm away, but my muscles refused.
I grabbed one of their arms anyway—barely—and managed to force her to look at me.
Her face was—
Wrong.
Distorted. Like I was seeing her underwater. Her eyes were too large, her mouth too wide. Her cheekbones too sharp and waxy. Something inside her skin twitched, like a heartbeat too close to the surface.
She leaned in close and smiled.
“Welcome home, Emily.”
Her voice was like rotted honey.
The other one moved closer.
“We’ve missed you,” she said gently.
The words were worse than screams.
I twisted, tried to break free, my breathing ragged. “Where am I? Where the hell is Lanie?”
Neither of them flinched.
“You’re safe now,” one said.
“You’re remembered,” said the other.
I screamed.
“I need to see her—I need to see her right now!”
They didn’t answer.
They just pressed their hands to my temples, whispered things that didn’t belong in any human language.
And behind their heads—behind the glaring light above me—I saw a shadow shift.
Someone else was in the room.
Watching.
Waiting.

Chapter Twenty
The missing piece has returned.

They brought me to the field at dawn.
The same one I had dreamed of. The one from the books. From the rituals. But this time… it was real.
I could feel the chill of dew soaking into my knees. The silence wasn’t empty—it was waiting.
The cult grounds stretched far and wide. A vast clearing of dead grass, patches of dark, upturned soil like something had clawed its way out. The sky was gray, soft and low, and in the distance stood the buildings I remembered from my nightmares: wood-rotted cabins with warped windows, a chapel without a cross, and a bell tower that never rang.
I didn’t know how I was standing.
My legs felt boneless, barely attached. Every step was a fight.
And then he spoke.
From the raised platform at the center of the field—a blackened altar framed by robed figures—he emerged.
The Lord.
His face was hidden beneath a thick hood. His voice sounded like it came from the bottom of the earth.
“The missing piece has returned,” he said.
“Emily Harper. Born of imbalance. Blood of consequence. You have wandered. You have betrayed. But now… you remember.”
I shook my head. “No—I don’t—this isn’t real—”
I tried to run. I got two steps before collapsing again.
My lungs burned. My vision blurred.
“You left your purpose behind,” the Lord continued, “but we have prepared your return. Everything you experienced—every love, every comfort, every illusion—was designed to bring you home.”
I screamed. Lanie’s name tore from my throat like a wound.
Nothing. No answer. No sign of her. Not even a trace.
Then—like a bolt of memory—I remembered the knife. The blood. My hands.
What I’d done.
“No…” I gasped. “No, no, no—Lanie—”
“Silence her,” the Lord commanded.
Several robed figures surrounded me. Cold hands grabbed my arms, my face. A thick cloth was shoved into my mouth, tied tight at the back of my head. My scream was cut off mid-breath.
I choked.
I sobbed.
I tried to fight them off but couldn’t move.
The chanting resumed. Their voices in unison, humming something low and unnatural.
The Lord raised his arms like a preacher and continued:
“From illusion, she will be reborn.
From forgetfulness, she will remember.
The mother is gone. The sister is gone.
But the daughter remains. The vessel endures.”
When the light faded, I found myself inside a cabin.
Not just any cabin—one from my dreams.
The inside smelled like old pine and damp dirt. A stove rested cold in the corner. The floorboards were uneven, warped with moisture. An old quilt lay over a splintered bedframe. There were cracks in the walls where light slithered through. Spiderwebs hugged the corners. And on the wooden table in front of me sat a notebook.
My notebook.
The same one I had in my apartment.
I reached for it with trembling fingers. The pages were blank.
Across from me, an older woman sat, her face pale and kind, but empty in the way nurses in bad dreams are.
She reached across the table and touched my wrist gently.
“Do you remember anything… while you were away?”
I couldn’t speak. I just stared.
“Write it down,” she said. “Everything you saw. Everything you felt. You’ll feel better once it’s on the page. You always do.”
I looked down at the pen.
I remembered Lanie’s smile. Her laugh. Her blonde streaks. The way she made me feel like I wasn’t disappearing.
But she wasn’t real.
None of it was.
The café. The apartment. My job. The nights we talked for hours.
It was all a veil.
A trap.
I never left the cult.
I had never escaped.
Everything had been fabricated to make me forget.
To erase my mother’s scream.
To erase my sister’s tiny, still body.
They made me forget them.
They made me forget who I was—so I could become what they needed me to be.
I picked up the pen.
And I began to write.

I’m—
I don’t know where—

it smells like smoke again
or something burned
or someone

I thought the field was behind me
but I can still feel grass in my mouth

Lanie was—
no, is?
no.

My name is Emily Harper.
I was born in—
(where was it?)

I keep writing it down so I don’t forget
but it’s not helping
it’s not helping
it’s not helping

They said I chose this
but I don’t remember choosing anything

She had two blonde streaks in her hair
I remember that
I remember that

I had a sister
(didn’t I?)

Why do I only remember the scream
not the sound before it

STOP

They’re watching me write this
I don’t know if I’m allowed to know this much

The light in the hallway just flickered

The Lord said I was the missing piece

So why do I feel erased

If you find this

don’t
the handwriting’s not mine
except it is
except it’s hers.
lanie?
me?
i’m not wearing my hands today. they feel                    like  gloves. too big. too loud.
the walls are breathing again.
they’re whispering.
no—chanting.
or maybe it’s just the pipes.
maybe it’s just them.
i found dirt under my nails.
was i outside again?
was that today?
my notebook smells like smoke.
my pillow is wet.
i wrote “remember” seventeen times in the margin and i don’t remember writing it once.
THEY LIED
THEY LIED
THEY LIED
they took lanie
they took my name
they folded me inside a different girl
and i’ve been walking around wearing her like skin
my mother’s voice is in the air vents.
i asked her what happened
she told me to hush.
she told me “they’re still watching.”
i saw my sister last night.
she was standing at the foot of my bed with no eyes.
just teeth.
and that music again—the hum.
low and slow like breathing
like something waiting.
like something hungry.
stop reading this.
stop stop stop
they’ll smell the ink.
they’ll smell the truth.
i need to burn this.
i need to bury this.
i need to—
wait.
who’s in the hall—

chapter seven
Late Hours 

I stayed after six.

But just after—around 6:15—Jay passed by my desk on his way out. His keys jingled in one hand, blazer slung over his shoulder like always. He paused when he saw me still typing, his brow lifting with quiet surprise.

“Emily,” he said. “You’re still here?”

I didn’t look up from my screen. “Just making up the work from today.”

He stepped closer, folding his arms in a way that meant concerned boss mode was kicking in.

“You know you don’t have to push yourself like this. You’re already my best. If something’s going on… we can talk.”

I forced a quick smile. “I’m fine. Just a weird week.”

Jay studied me for a second. He wasn’t a prying type, but he wasn’t blind either. Eventually, he nodded.

“Well, don’t stay too late. I’ll leave the lights on this floor for another hour. Lock up when you’re done.”

“Thanks, Jay.”

He gave me one last look before walking off, footsteps echoing down the hallway, fading into the quiet. Then the elevator chimed and he was gone.

But I stayed.

I had to.

I’ve never been the kind of person who falls behind. Never needed reminders or make-up work or sympathy. But now, everything felt off-kilter—like my life had shifted a few degrees sideways. Sleep-deprived days. Lingering fear. Memories crawling back that weren’t mine, or maybe were.

I needed to get back to normal.

Before the dreams.
Before the whispers and shadows.
Before the word cult stopped sounding absurd.

So I worked. I buried myself in numbers, forms, claim notes. I let the structure of it cradle me like rails on a track. If I just kept moving forward, maybe I wouldn’t fall apart.

The rest of the office dimmed slowly. Lights clicked off section by section. Chairs sat empty. Cubicles like grave markers.

The building was nearly silent, save for the occasional hum of the air vents cycling stale air through the ducts. Fluorescent lights buzzed low above me as I finished typing my final notes—sharp clicks echoing louder than they should in the empty space. Everyone had gone home. No printer whirring, no phones ringing, no footsteps on the carpeted floor.

The insurance office felt wrong after hours.

Cold.

Deserted.

Rows of cubicles stretched ahead like abandoned cages—computer monitors blank, chairs turned in slightly different angles, water bottles left half-full on desks like forgotten offerings. The breakroom, visible through the frosted glass wall, sat dark except for the red light on the microwave clock, blinking 6:42… 6:43… over and over like a pulse.

I shut down my computer, gathered my things, and stood slowly. The silence pressed in on my ears. The kind of silence that wasn’t empty—but watchful. Like the building was holding its breath.

I stepped into the hallway, lights flickering in soft clusters above. Most were off completely now, casting the carpet in long stretches of shadow broken only by faint, yellow-tinted emergency lights along the walls.

That’s when I saw it.

At the very end of the corridor.

A figure.

Motionless. Standing beneath the dim glow of the exit sign.

It wasn’t doing anything—just existing. The shape of a person, tall, shoulders slightly hunched forward, arms at its sides. Too far to make out a face. No sound. No breath. Just the presence of someone—or something—that shouldn’t be there.

I froze. For a heartbeat, I couldn’t tell if I was fully awake.

Was this another dream?

My feet started forward before I made the decision to move, almost like I’d been pulled. One cautious step. Another.

Then—
My phone rang.

Sharp and sudden, vibrating in my coat pocket with a high, electronic trill.

I startled, my eyes flicking down to the glowing screen.

Lanie.

And when I looked back up…

The figure was gone.

Just shadows and empty carpet now. A faint creak in the air vents. The exit sign still blinking, steady and innocent. But the hallway was empty.

I swallowed hard and answered the call. “Hello?”

“Hey,” Lanie said, voice warm but quiet. “Everything okay? I’ve texted a few times.”

I glanced at my notifications. Five unread messages.

“Sorry,” I murmured. “Work got crazy. I stayed late to catch up. I think I just need to get home and crash.”

“You sure?” she asked. “You sound… weird. I mean, more than usual.”

I tried to laugh. It came out thin.

“Want to get dinner?” she offered. “Or—I could come over. I make a killer grilled cheese when I’m trying to impress people.”

The thought of going home alone—of walking into my apartment, locking the door behind me, and sitting in that too-still silence—felt unbearable.

“Yeah,” I said. “Actually… that sounds really nice.”

“On my way,” she said without hesitation. “You like tomato soup?”

“I do now.”

We hung up.

I stood there a moment longer, still staring down the hallway.

There was nothing there.

Nothing at all.

And yet, as I turned toward the elevator, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d almost seen something I wasn’t supposed to.

That I’d almost gotten too close.

10:42 PM

i woke up with it again—
walls breathing
furniture wrong moved
everything wrong off

it was here.
i think.
maybe.

the hallway kept going.
too long for this building
too long for any building
it bent. it breathed.

why was the wallpaper bleeding
or was it just—
just red.

letters
scrawled across the seams—
“You were always meant for this.”
no no no
that’s not mine
i didn’t write that
i didn’t write that

someone behind the wall
knew my name
whispered it like
like a prayer or a punishment

don’t follow the humming
don’t open the third door
don’t look at their faces
don’t look at their faces
DON’T LOOK AT THEIR FACES

Lanie
Lanie was there
but not her
not the real her
the version with no mouth
just eyes
dark dark dark

she tried to speak
but her teeth were bleeding
and when she reached for me
her hands were burned

she keeps pulling away
won’t answer my calls
won’t meet my eyes
not since i asked about the white room

she’s scared
she knows something’s changing
i’m changing
maybe she already knew

she said i was lucky to forget
but what if
what if she’s the one who made me forget?
what if she brought me back on purpose?

did she come to find me—
or to finish what they started?

they came in threes
they always came in threes
they took the third
took her sister
took
mine?
i didn’t have a sister
did i
did i

there was blood on my hands
when i woke up
or ink
or something else

metal
metal in my mouth
like keys
like knives
like coins on a dead tongue

i saw it again today
i think
no. i know
by the breakroom
too tall
no face
no eyes but it saw me
it knew me

what if this isn’t dreaming
what if this is
remembering
what if i didn’t forget
what if i was taught to forget
like Lanie said

she’s slipping
she’s lying
or protecting me
or using me
i don’t know anymore

am i the third
was i the one
they said i was the one
i don’t want it
i don’t want it

i don’t want it i don’t want it i don’t want it

but it

chapter eight 
The Pulling

The days bleed.

They don’t pass normally anymore—they seep, smudge, overlap. I wake up unsure what day it is, what time it’s supposed to be, what I was doing before the world turned sideways again.

Yesterday, I walked to work with two mismatched shoes. One boot, one sneaker.

I didn’t notice until I sat down at my desk.

Everything feels like that now. Close to right, but off. Warped. Like I’ve slipped into a copy of my life and can’t find the edges to tear through.

At work, I stare at screens that change without my input. I answer emails twice. Sometimes three times. Once, I found an entire document in my drafts—written in my voice but not mine. It was about “the reckoning” and “the return” and “balance through the third.” I deleted it. Emptied the trash. But it still shows up in my recent files. Every day. Like it’s waiting for me.

And Jay—my boss—has started watching me more closely. The kind of glances you try to pretend you don’t notice.

It was late in the afternoon when he finally stopped by my desk.

I was halfway through editing the same paragraph for the fourth time. I think I kept rearranging the same three words, convinced something wasn’t right. I didn’t even notice him standing there until he cleared his throat.

“Emily.”

I looked up too fast, blinking like I’d just been caught stealing.

“Hey, Jay. I’m just… finishing up a few things.”

He looked at me for a long moment. Not annoyed. Not angry. Just… concerned. That made it worse somehow.

“You’ve been here late every night this week,” he said.

I gave a weak smile. “Just trying to catch up is all.”

He nodded slowly, but his eyes didn’t leave mine. I realized, too late, that I probably looked like hell. Pale. Sleep-deprived. My clothes wrinkled, my hair pulled back with little care.

“Emily,” he said carefully, “I need you to take a few days off.”

I frowned. “I’m fine.”

“You’re not,” he said gently, but firmly. “Take the time. Get some rest. Recharge.”

“I don’t need—”

Jay held up a hand. “It’s not a request. It’s a requirement. Just a few days. You’ll still get paid. Use your PTO time.”

I sat back, blinking. I didn’t know what to say. My chest tightened. I hated the idea of stepping away—of being alone for longer than I already was.

“I’m okay,” I tried again. “Really.”

“You’re exhausted. And honestly? You’re starting to scare people a little.”

The words landed hard. They weren’t cruel, but they were honest.

“I’m not firing you, Emily. I’m just asking you to take care of yourself.”

I swallowed hard and nodded, slowly. “Okay.”

“Good.” He exhaled. “You’ll be better for it.”

I didn’t believe him.

That night, I went home and stared at the ceiling until the shadows moved. I didn’t sleep. I didn’t even try. I called Lanie instead.

Her voice on the other end of the line was soft. Thin.

“Hello?”

“Can I come over?” I asked. “Please?”

A pause.

Then: “Yeah. Yeah, of course.”

Her apartment used to feel warm—jungle plants, incense, thrifted mugs. A little chaotic, but safe.

Now? Now it’s empty in all the wrong places.

The air smelled sour and sweet, like vanilla rotting. The blinds were drawn tight, the walls dim. Most of her plants were dying—slumped in their pots, leaves spotted and brittle. I hadn’t even realized how quiet it was until I stepped inside. No kettle. No hum of music. Just the low sound of her pacing.

She was pale. Her eyes were darker than usual—shadowed. There was something on her sleeve, dried and rust-colored.

“Lanie,” I said, my voice already trembling, “talk to me.”

She kept pacing, mumbling something under her breath.

And then—barely above a whisper:

“They want you back.”

My stomach dropped.

I stood frozen for a second too long, the words ringing in my ears like a bell.

“…What did you just say?” I whispered.

She turned to me, startled, eyes wide like I’d slapped her.

“I didn’t say anything,” she said quickly. “Emmy… are you okay?”

“You did,” I said. “You said they want me back.”

“No. I swear I didn’t. You’re just… you’re tired. You’ve been dreaming again, haven’t you?”

I stared at her, something creeping into my chest that I didn’t have a name for.

“I’m not dreaming when I’m awake.”

She looked away.

“You’ve been remembering things that didn’t happen,” she said. “The stories I told you—they’re leaking in.”

“No,” I said. “That’s not it. I know these things.”

“You need rest,” she said again. “You need to stop digging.”

“I think I already did. I think this is what was buried.”

She said nothing.

But her silence said everything.

And when I finally fell asleep that night—

I didn’t dream.
I remembered.

The woods.
The circle.
The white robes.
The crying child.
My hands.
The bowl.
The phrase—

“You were always meant for this.”

The words tumbled out of my mouth like a prayer I’d said before.

And I knew the child.
I knew her.

And when I woke up,
the dirt on my sheets told me I’d brought something back with me.

And I wasn’t sure I was ever going to sleep again.


Chapter Nine
the unrecognizable 

I didn’t mean to fall asleep again.
One moment I was sitting on the edge of the bed, blinking too slow, Lanie’s soft voice drifting from the kitchen — and the next, everything was gone. Time folded in on itself. The air shifted.
When I opened my eyes, it was quiet.
Too quiet.
No hum from the fridge. No traffic outside. Just stillness, like the whole apartment was holding its breath.
Then—
“Emmy?” A hand touched my shoulder. Warm, firm. “Hey, sleepyhead.”
I jerked upright.
Lanie stood over me, eyes soft, holding a chipped black mug in one hand.
“You okay?” she asked. “Didn’t mean to scare you. I just brought you some coffee.”
My heart was racing, skin clammy against the sheets. “What time is it?”
“A little after ten.”
“Morning?”
She smiled. “Yeah. You slept like the dead.”
My throat was dry. “I didn’t mean to. I was just resting my eyes.”
“You always say that,” she teased, handing me the mug. “You fall asleep like a cat in a sunbeam. Blink and you’re gone.”
I stared into the coffee. It was dark and fragrant, a soft swirl of cream curling through it like smoke. Something about it felt… off. But I didn’t say that.
Lanie sat at the edge of the bed beside me, tucking one leg beneath her.
“You dream?” she asked gently.
I hesitated. “I think so. But I don’t remember what.”
“Maybe that’s for the best.”
I looked over at her, unsure. “Why would that be better?”
Lanie’s smile was faint, distant. “Some dreams aren’t dreams. They’re pieces. Fragments trying to float to the surface. And sometimes it’s better to let them stay buried. Until you’re ready.
When I finally stood and looked at the bed again, I froze.
The dirt was gone.
Not smeared. Not scattered. Not shifted around like someone had tried to clean it. Gone. Completely.
The sheets were smooth and pale, tucked perfectly beneath the mattress.
I stared, breath caught in my throat. My pulse thudded at my temples.
Lanie followed my gaze. “What is it?”
“There was dirt,” I said quietly. “Right there. Under the covers. When I woke up last night.”
She blinked. “Dirt?”
I nodded. “Dark. Like soil. And it smelled like—like outside. Like rot.”
Lanie moved closer. “Are you sure?”
“Yes.” My voice cracked. “I touched it. I felt it.”
She looked at the bed, then back at me, her expression unreadable. “Emmy… there’s nothing there now.”
“I know,” I said. “But it was. I swear—”
“You were exhausted last night. You could’ve been dreaming with your eyes open. You’ve done that before.”
“I’m not—” I stopped myself, fists clenched at my sides. “I’m not imagining things.”
Lanie reached for my hand. “I didn’t say you were.”
“But you think I made it up.”
“No,” she said, squeezing gently. “I think your mind is trying to show you something, and maybe you’re not ready to see the whole thing yet. That doesn’t mean it’s not real.”
I pulled my hand back. “I hate that. I hate not knowing what’s real.”
“I know you do.”
“I feel like I’m going crazy.”
“You’re not.”
I sat back down on the bed, rubbing my face. “I just want to trust what I see. What I remember.”
She was quiet for a moment, then said softly, “What if what you remember… isn’t the whole truth?”
Later, in the bathroom, I stared into the mirror again.
The skin beneath my eyes looked even darker now, as if the sleep had only made me more tired. The bruise on my neck was still there. Fainter than before. But real.
I reached up and touched it.
The moment I did, something flickered. A voice — soft and cold — brushed the edge of my memory:
“Three for balance. One for fire.”
My knees nearly gave out.
I didn’t tell Lanie.
Not about the bruise. Or the voice. Or the reflection that seemed a half-second too slow.
She handed me a second mug of tea when I came back out, a rich red color this time. Steam drifted lazily upward.
“Chamomile,” she said. “You’ve been tense.”
“I’m fine.”
“Emmy,” she said, tilting her head, “you don’t have to act okay for me. You never have.”
“I’m fine.” But my fingers trembled around the handle.
We sat on the couch. The TV was on, low volume, some old movie playing in the background. I wasn’t really watching. My eyes kept drifting toward the coat closet.
There was a padlock on it now.
Had that been there yesterday?
“You cold?” Lanie asked, brushing a strand of hair from my face.
I shook my head. “No.”
“You’re quiet.”
“I’m tired.”
She leaned her head on my shoulder. “Do you remember the first time we talked?”
I paused. “At the coffee shop.”
“Yeah, but do you remember it? What I was wearing? What you said?”
I frowned. “You were in black. I think.”
“Everyone wears black in the fall,” she said gently.
I tried again. “You made me a drink I didn’t order. Told me it was something I needed.”
“That part’s true,” she said, smiling faintly. “You didn’t even question it.”
“I should have.”
Lanie sat up a little straighter. “Do you trust me, Emily?”
The question caught me off guard.
“I don’t know.”
“That’s honest.”
“Do you trust me?”
“Of course,” she said. “I think you just don’t trust yourself yet. But you will.”
Later that night, after Lanie stepped outside to make a call, I returned to the bathroom.
I locked the door behind me.
The mark on my neck was darker now. A ring of bruised skin. And at the center — not just an indentation, but a shape.
A circle, with a line through it. Familiar in a way that made my stomach turn.
I leaned closer.
This time, my reflection smiled at me.
And I didn’t.

Chapter Ten
Research

I left that night.
I didn’t say much — just told Lanie I needed air, that I’d sleep better in my own bed. She looked like she wanted to argue, to follow, maybe even to hold onto me for a second longer.
But she didn’t.
She just stood in the doorway as I walked down the hall, arms folded across her chest, the light from her apartment pooling behind her like a stage.
“Text me when you get there,” she said.
I nodded.
I didn’t look back.
The streets were quiet. The air heavy, still clinging to the warmth of the day. My shoes echoed on the sidewalk as I walked, and the shadows between the buildings seemed deeper than usual.
I kept glancing over my shoulder, unsure what I expected to see.
Something.
Someone.
But there was nothing.
Just me and my reflection in dark windows.
And the mark on my neck.
When I stepped into my apartment, the first thing I did was lock the door. Then I locked it again.
The silence inside hit harder than I expected. It wasn’t peaceful. It was hollow.
Like the apartment hadn’t missed me.
Like it barely remembered I lived there.
I flipped on the lights. Everything was exactly how I left it. My worn-out sneakers by the door. A dish in the sink. The lamp still flickering slightly from a bad bulb.
But it all felt off.
I ran a hand through my hair and dropped onto the couch, notebook in my lap. I opened to the last page I’d written and stared.
the dirt wasn’t real
reflection blinked late
voice: three for balance, one for fire
ask lanie if they ever mark people
And under that, scribbled in darker ink:
the dreams started after lanie told me about the restoration
I stared at that last line, heart thudding.
It was true. Before she told me about the cult, I hadn’t dreamed anything.
No strange symbols.
No black soil.
No marks on my skin.
What if knowing wasn’t the problem?
What if remembering was?
Sleep didn’t come easy.
I kept the light on. Laid in bed fully dressed, notebook beside me, pen clutched in my fist.
But no dreams came. Just the hum of the refrigerator through the wall and the phantom echo of my own heartbeat.
By the time the sun cracked the horizon, I already knew what I was going to do.
At 8:34 AM, I texted Lanie:

you busy? -E
never for you - L
what’s going on? -L
i want to look into the restoration -E
meet me at the library. 11. -E
okay -L
you sure? -L
no -E
come anyway -E

We met outside the old brick library near the river.
Lanie was already waiting when I got there, perched on the steps in an oversized hoodie and ripped jeans, hair tied up in a messy bun. She looked younger somehow, like the version of her that first handed me a coffee I didn’t ask for.
“You’re up early,” she said, standing.
“I never really went to sleep.”
“Same.”
We didn’t say much as we walked inside.
The library was cold and quiet, the kind of place that smelled like damp paper and forgotten time. It took a while to get access to the archive room, but once we were in, it felt like a different world — yellowed newspaper clippings, dusty microfiche reels, and stacks of uncatalogued local history books.
Lanie took the digital end — computers and public records. I started on the physical files, scanning for any mention of The Restoration.
Most of it was garbage. Ghost stories. Message board rants from the late ‘90s. Articles too vague to lead anywhere. But then Lanie appeared behind me with a few printouts in her hands.
“I found something,” she said, sliding a page onto the table.
A newspaper scan. Local paper. Dated 1998.
LOCAL FARM RAIDED — AUTHORITIES REMOVE THREE CHILDREN FROM ‘ISOLATED SPIRITUAL COMMUNITY’
I sat up straighter.
Lanie tapped the margin. “Edgehill. It’s a tiny town. Hour west of here.”
I read the piece.
The article described a “rural religious collective” — no name mentioned, but language eerily similar to what Lanie had told me: group rituals, third-child births, forced seclusion, education through scripture only.
And one line buried in the second paragraph:
“…local residents referred to the group as ‘The Restoration.’”
My blood went cold.
“They’re real,” I whispered.
“I told you,” Lanie said softly.
I looked up at her. “That’s where your mother was from?”
She nodded once.
“I thought they all disappeared.”
“They did,” she said. “But not before leaving pieces behind.”
We kept going.
As the afternoon wore on, we found more.
Mentions in old fringe magazines. A burned pamphlet scanned onto a conspiracy blog. And finally, a grainy photo of a carved wooden sign half-covered by moss:
THE RESTORATION HOUSE OF LIGHT
Below it, etched into the wood, was a strange symbol.
A circle split by a vertical line.
I felt my fingers drift to my neck.
Lanie noticed.
“They called it the Binding Mark,” she said. “Anyone marked was considered… part of the prophecy. A vessel. Or a key.”
“A key to what?”
She didn’t answer. Not right away.
When she finally spoke, her voice was low. Almost afraid.
“Not everyone was meant to live through it.”
I stared down at the symbol. The grainy photo. The circle.
And the line.
Same shape.
Same spot.
Same pressure on my skin, right at the base of my throat.
“Lanie,” I said slowly, “how did they mark people?”
She didn’t flinch.
“They waited until you couldn’t fight it. Until you were asleep. Or worse.”
The library light flickered above us. A bulb buzzed. Somewhere down the aisle, a cart creaked slowly along the floor — but no one was there.
I swallowed hard.
“Then we keep going,” I said.
Lanie’s eyes searched mine. “Even if you don’t like what you find?”
“I have to find it.”

Chapter Eleven  
coming together 

The librarian gave me a look when I brought the stack to the counter — books on fringe religions, historical cults, symbolism in rural America. One even had a hand-drawn circle with a line through it on the spine.
I didn’t care. I checked them out, stuffed them into my tote, and followed Lanie out the door.
We didn’t talk much on the way to the car. Something about what we’d seen — the articles, the mark, that word vessel — had left both of us quiet.
“Text me if you find anything else,” Lanie said, hand on the door.
“I will.”
“You okay?”
I nodded. But I wasn’t sure if it was true.
Back at my apartment, I kicked off my shoes and dumped the books onto the coffee table. The apartment was too quiet again, the air too still. I left the door unlocked this time, not because I felt safe — but because I didn’t want to be trapped.
I flipped through one of the books at random, something about Appalachian cults and messianic offshoots. Pages crinkled under my fingers, dry and yellowed at the edges. I scanned words without absorbing them.
Third-born. Ritual fire. Devotion. Cleansing.
The same phrases repeated, always with slight variations, like the meaning kept shifting just out of reach.
Eventually, my head started to nod.
I didn’t mean to fall asleep.
The dream didn’t feel like a dream.
It began with silence.
But not the peaceful kind — the kind right before something awful happens.
I stood in a clearing. My feet were bare, buried ankle-deep in dark, cold mud. The trees loomed unnaturally tall, bark blackened and pulsing like breathing skin. The sky overhead was a mess of ash and bruised clouds, swirling without wind.
A massive fire blazed in the center of the clearing, but it gave off no warmth.
Figures circled it.
All in white robes.
All facing inward.
Some wore animal masks — crude and snarling: deer, fox, wolf, horse — stretched tight over human faces, stitched with red thread. One of them turned slightly, and I saw a human mouth underneath the snout, wide and grinning, teeth filed to sharp points.
Their movements were jerky.
Too fast, then too slow.
Like time was folding in on itself.
The fire crackled, and from within it came a sound like screaming children — but in reverse.
The figures began to chant. Words I didn’t understand, yet somehow recognized. The syllables twisted inside my ears, sticky and wet, like they weren’t meant for mouths.
In the center of the circle stood a little girl.
Barefoot. Red-haired.
It was me.
Maybe eight years old.
Eyes glassy. Skin pale. Blank-faced.
She didn’t look afraid.
She looked empty.
Two of the masked figures stepped forward — holding a burlap sack that writhed like something was trapped inside. They opened it and pulled out what looked like a rabbit. Then a chicken. Then something I couldn’t name.
Each one was laid at the child’s feet. Still alive. Still twitching.
Blood pooled in the dirt.
Then the chanting stopped.
The leader stepped forward — hooded, face fully covered. Taller than the others. In one hand, he held a branding iron.
The same symbol.
A circle.
A vertical line through the center.
It glowed orange. Hissed like a snake.
I tried to scream, but my voice was gone. My feet were frozen.
The man approached the child — me — and lifted the iron.
“You are the third,” he said in a voice that vibrated through the bones in my chest.
“You are the key.”
He pressed the brand to the child’s throat.
A violent sizzle, a flash of blinding light — and then she turned.
The younger version of me looked straight at me.
Her eyes were hollow.
“You let them do this,” she whispered. “You watched.”
The shadows behind the figures exploded outward — black limbs, too many eyes, open mouths gasping silently — and the entire circle collapsed inward.
Into fire.
Into me.
I jolted awake with a full-body gasp.
My shirt was soaked. My arms were trembling.
The book I’d been reading had fallen to the floor, splayed open on a section about ritual markings in backwoods communities. But something was different.
There was writing in the margin.
Handwritten.
“Restoration Grounds – Route 12, Edgehill. Past the old sawmill. Turn where the fence is broken.”
The ink was smudged. Uneven. Not printed.
And it looked like my handwriting.
But I hadn’t written it.
Not while I was awake.
I stared at it, the letters almost pulsing on the page. A buzzing sound crawled inside my ears.
Something was pulling me.
I didn’t hesitate.
The drive was quiet.
The sky had gone fully black by the time I passed the edge of town. The road stretched into nothing — long, cracked pavement that narrowed the deeper I went.
The sawmill came up on the right — collapsed roof, windows gone. A massive fence, twisted and half-swallowed by trees, stood just beyond.
There was a break in the wire.
Exactly where the book said.
No lights. No birds. No wind.

Chapter Twelve
Arriving 

The road narrowed the deeper I went.
First pavement. Then gravel. Then dirt. My tires crunched over broken stones and fallen leaves, the trees closing in on either side like they were slowly swallowing the road whole.
Fog crept in from nowhere, thick and low. My headlights barely cut through it. The darkness beyond was absolute.
My phone buzzed in the passenger seat.
Lanie.
I didn’t answer.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Pause.
Buzz.
I clenched the steering wheel tighter, my knuckles pale. I didn’t want to hear her voice. Not yet. Not while everything in me was being pulled forward like a rope tied to something just out of view.
Something waiting.
The wind shifted. My ears popped like the elevation had changed. The forest grew silent.
Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.
Lanie.
Again.
Finally, I picked up the phone and turned it over, ready to silence it for good.
But then I saw the text:
“Please Emily. Pick up. Please don’t go there.”
My chest tightened. I stared at the screen as the dirt road curved, trees warping in my peripheral vision. I didn’t slow down.
Another call came in.
I let it ring twice. Then pressed accept.
Held the phone to my ear.
Said nothing.
“Emily?” Lanie’s voice cracked on the second syllable. “Are you—where are you?”
Silence stretched between us like a frayed wire.
“I found it,” I said finally. My voice sounded distant. Not like me.
Lanie inhaled sharply. “No. No, Emily, please. Please tell me you’re not there.”
“I found the address in the book.”
“You—You read it? That wasn’t meant for you, Emmy, you weren’t supposed to go alone—” Her words came fast, tangled with panic.
“I needed to see it. I needed to know.”
“No, you don’t. You think you do, but you don’t understand. You don’t remember.”
I pulled the car to a stop just past a crumbling wooden post. A gate long fallen. The trees here were bent unnaturally. The grass had died in strange shapes — spirals, perfect circles, like the ground itself had been scorched by meaning.
“I’m here,” I said.
On the other end, Lanie made a sound. A sharp, broken sob that punched straight through the speaker.
“Please come back,” she whispered. “Please, Emily. I should’ve told you more, I didn’t think it would start again—”
I opened the car door. Cold air rushed in, smelling of damp soil and old smoke.
“What do you mean start again?”
Lanie was crying now. Full, raw, helpless. “You don’t remember what they did to you. What you were. You think this started when I told you—but it didn’t. It started when you were born. You were part of them, Emmy. You were one of them.”
My whole body went still.
“I can’t let you go back in there,” she said. “It’ll take you. It’ll finish what it started.”
I looked past the trees.
There was something up ahead.
A path.
A clearing.
The dream came rushing back in flashes—hooded figures, firelight, the brand—
My younger self looking at me with hollow eyes.
“You let them do this.”
“I have to know,” I whispered.
“No—Emily, wait—”
I ended the call.
Slipped the phone into my pocket.
And stepped into the dark.

Chapter Thirteen
The Restoration Grounds

The path narrowed the farther I walked.
Weeds grew in thick snarls that pulled at my jeans, thorns dragging against my ankles like fingers. The trees leaned unnaturally inward, their branches gnarled into twisted shapes, some split open like wounds. Moss coated their trunks, thick and spongy under my touch, and in the quiet, I could hear water dripping from leaf to leaf — slow, rhythmic, like a clock counting down.
There was no wind.
No birds. No insects.
Only silence.
And the feeling of being watched.
I stepped over a sun-bleached bone — something small, animal, maybe — and didn’t let myself look too long. Every instinct in me screamed to turn back, but I kept walking.
The trees broke open like a seam being torn, and I stepped into the clearing.
The earth was wrong here.
A wide field stretched out before me, but it wasn’t overgrown like the forest — it was barren. Dead. The soil was pale, grayish, almost ashy, and split open in deep cracks like it hadn’t seen water in years. No grass. No weeds. No sound.
Just emptiness.
Like something had scoured this place clean.
In the distance stood the remains of a structure — what must have once been the cult’s gathering place. It was larger than I expected. A rectangular chapel, tall and narrow, but completely decayed. The roof had caved in on one side, exposing the ribcage of rafters inside. Its wooden slats were waterlogged and warped, the white paint peeling like skin from a sunburn.
A crude cross still hung over the door, but it was crooked, the nails rusted to nothing. One shutter banged slowly against the siding, even though there was no breeze.
To the left of the building was a stone circle, just like the one in my dream. Seven flat stones arranged in a near-perfect ring, the center scorched black. Bits of melted wax pooled at the base of one. Ash stained the edges.
Behind it, scattered throughout the field like a forest of warnings, were rows of wooden stakes. Hundreds of them. Some broken. Some upright. A few still had rope tied near the top, knotted and frayed, swinging slightly as though disturbed by breath rather than wind.
To the right of the chapel, there was what might once have been a garden — but now it was a lifeless grid. Neatly divided plots of nothing. The earth too hard to have grown anything in years. No flowers. No crops. Just dry, sunken rectangles full of dust.
And it was all… quiet.
Too quiet.
The kind of silence that feels hollow. Empty. Like it’s been manufactured — not a lack of sound, but the removal of it.
I took a step forward.
Then another.
The air felt heavier here. Charged. Like the moment before a lightning strike.
Something rustled behind me.
I turned — fast.
A figure sprinted from the tree line.
I didn’t move.
Couldn’t.
The person — if it was a person — ran straight toward me, barefoot and frantic. Their robes hung off their frame like soaked cloth, streaked with dirt and blood. Their skin was gray, almost translucent in the light, and their mouth hung open but made no sound.
They stopped inches from me.
Too close.
The figure stared deep into my eyes, wide and unblinking.
His irises were clouded over, like cataracts — but still alert, like he could see through me. He smelled of rot and smoke. Like something unearthed.
He raised a trembling finger.
And pointed directly at my throat.
I froze.
Pain exploded beneath my jaw — sharp, instant, searing like a brand pressed to skin. My hand flew up, grasping at my neck. But there was no wound I could feel.
Just pain.
It bloomed outward like fire. My legs gave out.
I hit the ground hard, knees digging into the cracked earth. Dust rose in a small plume around me. The man just stood there, still pointing, head tilting slightly like he was studying a specimen.
And then he smiled.
It was wrong. Crooked. Lips splitting at the corners.
I gasped. The air felt thick, impossible to swallow.
I looked up at the sky — and realized the clouds weren’t moving. Nothing was. It was like time had stopped.
My vision blurred.
The chapel pulsed in the corner of my eye, the way things do in dreams right before they collapse into nightmares.
And then—
Darkness took me.
Like a curtain being drawn.

Journal Entry 

November 25, 2018   
Emily Harper

I’ve never been very good at describing myself.
It always feels like I’m talking about someone else—someone I used to know, or maybe someone I made up.
The way you might recall a dream you’re not sure you actually had.
Familiar in flashes. Gone the moment you try too hard to hold on.

I have red hair. Auburn, really.
It catches the light when the sun hits just right—burnished copper in summer, deeper and darker in the colder months, like rusted metal left out in the rain.
Most days, I wear it up. Twisted into a loose knot or pulled back with a tie I keep around my wrist.
It’s not about style. It’s habit.
Out of the way, out of mind.
Something about letting it fall around my shoulders feels too exposed, too… noticeable.

My skin is pale—almost translucent in some light.
I freckle easily. Always have.
There’s a scatter of them across my nose, my cheeks, the tops of my shoulders. I used to hate them.
When I was younger, I tried to scrub them away with lemon juice, like someone told me once in a magazine.
Now they feel like old ink blots.
Faint stains from a summer I don’t remember, like someone else lived it for me and left their proof behind.

I’m not very tall. Not very anything, really.
Just small in that way that makes people lower their voice around me, like I might break if they speak too loudly.
I don’t wear makeup. Not because I have anything against it—I just never learned how.
It always felt like painting over a face I don’t recognize.

I wear soft clothes.
Muted colors, nothing bright.
Cardigans with stretched cuffs, jeans that have been washed too many times, shoes that don’t make noise when I walk.
I like layers. They feel safe, like armor disguised as comfort.
I gravitate toward the kinds of things that blend into the background. The kinds of things that don’t ask to be noticed.

My eyes are a pale gray-blue.
Some days they look lighter.
Some days they look hollow.
I’ve caught my own reflection before and felt a split second of alarm—
like seeing a stranger mimic me from the other side of the glass.

People think I’m quiet. Polite.
Some call it calm.
Some call it soft.
But I think it’s just a stillness I’ve learned to live inside.
Like water in a glass held very still, afraid to spill.

There are parts of me I know I’ve lost.
Whole stretches of time that feel thin and worn, like an old bedsheet rubbed nearly transparent.
I’ve forgotten things.
Not little things—
Big things.
Pieces of who I was. What I felt. What happened.

So I write things down.

Not just important things like bills or deadlines or birthdays.
Everything.
What I wore. What I ate.
What I dreamed.
What song was playing when I woke up.
The shape of the clouds on my walk to work.
How I felt when I saw her—
Lanie.
Even if I’m afraid to admit it.

Because if I don’t write it down, it fades.
Some days feel like they never happened at all.
I can go back through my journals and see whole afternoons I wouldn’t remember otherwise.
I can track how the light changes in my apartment from month to month.
I can remember that I smiled, once, at something small.
Even if I don’t know why anymore.

There’s so much I’ve already lost.
Not just memories, but versions of myself.
Like I’ve been a hundred different girls,
and each one disappeared quietly when no one was looking.

Sometimes I wonder if trauma can do that.
If fear is strong enough to erase.
If guilt can hollow you out without you realizing it—
until all that’s left is routine.
A structure you’ve built like scaffolding just to keep standing.

I work in an insurance office.
Third cubicle from the window. Gray walls. Beige carpet.
Soft clicking of keys, low conversations behind glass.
I don’t hate it.
It gives me something to hold onto.
A reason to wake up, to move through the day.
A place where no one asks too many questions.
No one even calls me Emily unless they have to.
Mostly I’m just “her”—the quiet girl who’s always on time,
who eats the same lunch every day,
who never forgets to refill the printer paper tray.

That’s the way I like it.
Predictable. Safe.
Clean lines. Clear steps.

I built my life like that—
little routines that hold me together,
the same way I hold the pages of this notebook in my lap.

Every morning, I write before I leave for work.
Even just a few sentences.
Sometimes more.
It helps me feel real.
Grounded.
Here.

Because if I don’t, I drift.
And if I drift too far, I don’t know if I’ll find my way back.



chapter two
The beginning of the end 

It was early autumn, and the town was still tucked beneath the hush of morning. The pavement glistened with dew, fallen leaves pressed flat and dark across the sidewalk like ink stains. A soft mist hovered just above the ground, clinging to the spaces between buildings, and the air carried that unmistakable crispness that only comes at the start of the season. The sun had just begun to rise—low and golden, barely stretching over the rooftops—casting a warm, sleepy light that made everything feel softer, quieter.

I walked the same path I always did, passing shuttered storefronts and quiet windows. The town was still waking up, and I liked it best that way. Peaceful. Predictable.

The coffee shop sat on the corner of Willow and 3rd, snug between an old bookstore and a closed-down barber shop. Its red brick exterior was worn with time, ivy creeping up the side like it was trying to pull the place back into the earth. The wooden sign above the door creaked when the wind hit it just right, and the windows were always fogged on the inside this time of year, blurring the soft yellow glow within.

Even before stepping inside, the scent pulled me in—roasted espresso, vanilla, and the faintest trace of something sweet and spiced, like cinnamon sugar on warm bread. It wrapped around me like a memory I couldn’t place.

Inside, the warmth greeted me instantly. The walls were lined with old wood shelves filled with mismatched mugs and little potted plants. A couple of round tables sat near the front window, and the faint hum of indie music buzzed under the soft hiss of steaming milk. The bell above the door gave its familiar chime, and there she was.

Lanie.

Always behind the counter, like she belonged there. Same soft features, same bright smile—the kind that made you feel seen. I always matched it without thinking, like a reflex.

“One large mocha with two shots of espresso,” she said, already sliding the cup toward me.

I couldn’t help the smile tugging at my lips. “You know me so well.”

She laughed lightly. “You know, you’ve been coming in here for about two years now, every single day… and I still don’t know your name.”

That caught me off guard. Not because she asked—but because she was right. We’d gone all this time without actually speaking beyond orders and smiles. Maybe we were both too shy. Or maybe we’d just fallen into a rhythm neither of us wanted to disturb.

“Well,” I said, laughing softly, “I guess it never really came up.”

“My name’s Emily. Emily Harper. But my friends call me Emmy.”

“Nice to officially meet you, Emily,” she said, her voice light, playful. She handed me my cup, her fingers brushing mine in the smallest, softest way.

As I reached for it, something caught my eye—writing on the side of the cup, just above the logo.

Before I could read it, she added, almost too casually, “That’ll be $3.50.”

Still a little distracted, I handed her the cash and dropped the change in the tip jar without thinking.

“Thanks,” I said, stepping out into the cool air again. The breeze was crisper now, and I tucked the cup into both hands, letting the warmth seep into my fingers.

As I took my first sip, my eyes drifted back to the cup.

There it was, written in neat black ink, just under my name:

Here’s my number, 246.496.6729. Call me sometime :)

I stopped walking for a moment.

Then smiled.

For a moment, the rest of the world faded—the passing cars, the shifting wind, even the distant sound of someone unlocking a nearby storefront. All I could hear was my own heartbeat in my ears, like the sudden rush of water filling a quiet room.

I stared at the cup, blinking once, then again, just to make sure I wasn’t imagining it. The steam curled lazily from the lid, catching the light like a veil.

It felt like such a small thing. Ink on a paper cup. But somehow, it shifted something in me.

I turned back toward the shop instinctively, half-expecting to catch one last glimpse of her through the window. And there she was—Lanie—already moving behind the counter, but she looked up. Our eyes met for just a second. She gave a shy, knowing smile, and then turned away.

The moment broke, and I kept walking. My fingers tightened around the cup like it might float away if I let go.

I should’ve felt confident. Flattered, even. But instead, I felt… unsure. Nervous in a way I hadn’t been in years. She had always felt safe to me—a warm smile, a steady presence in the blur of routine. This was something else entirely.  
  


chapter two
The Blackout

I didn’t call Lanie that first night.

I thought about it—more than once.
The urge would rise in quiet waves, catching me off guard.
When I was brushing my teeth. When I was staring into the fridge, unsure if I was hungry. When I was lying in bed with the phone beside me, her number glowing soft and silent in the dark.

But I never pressed call.
The number sat in my contacts like a trapdoor—one that once opened, couldn’t be shut again. Just seeing it made my chest tighten.

Instead, I floated through the next few days in that hazy space between want and fear.
I’d unlock my phone, thumb hovering over her name.
Once, I even typed out a message—“Hey, are you around?”—but deleted it before I finished the sentence.
I kept telling myself: tomorrow.
Then: maybe the next day.

But still—I went back to the café.

Of course I did.

And there she was.
Always there, behind the counter, sleeves rolled to her elbows, her dark hair pulled back messily, like she’d forgotten she was beautiful.
That same soft smile that made the world seem quieter.
Those eyes that watched more than they let on.

But something had changed between us.
There was a gravity now.
A silent pull, like we were standing at opposite ends of a thread no one else could see.

On the third day, I broke the silence.

“I still have your number, you know,” I said casually, like I hadn’t rehearsed it five different ways in my head.

Her eyes lit up. “I was starting to think I scared you off.”

I smiled, though it didn’t quite reach. “Not scared.”

“Then call me.”

Her voice was light, but something underneath it felt weighted. Like it mattered.

So I did.
Later that night.
And again the next day.
And again after that.

It started with texts.
Small, harmless things.
What are you doing?
Have you ever tried that Thai place on Main?
This song made me think of you.

Then it became calls.
Then meetups.
Then routines that didn’t feel like routines.

Late walks through neighborhoods we didn’t belong to.
Laughing over street art and garbage bins and the way dogs looked at us like we were secrets.
A thrift store afternoon that turned into hours of flipping through old records and paperbacks with cracked spines.
She teased me about the notebooks I kept in my bag. I told her I needed them. She didn’t press.

Lanie made the world feel lighter.
But she also made it tilt in ways I didn’t expect.

One night, while we were sharing fries from a paper tray outside a gas station, she asked me, “What’s your earliest memory?”

I opened my mouth to answer.
Nothing came.

“I don’t know,” I said finally, embarrassed. “That’s weird. I guess I’ve never thought about it.”

She was quiet for a second.
Then: “Mine’s of a forest. But it didn’t feel real. The trees were too still. Like they were watching.”

I looked at her. “That’s… eerie.”

“I know,” she said, smiling. “But it felt like home. In a way.”

She said it like a joke. But it didn’t feel like one.

A week later, we met at an old bookstore downtown.
Rain streaked down the fogged windows, and the air inside smelled like dust, paper, and time.
We wandered aimlessly through the aisles, speaking in whispers, fingers brushing over old covers and faded titles.

Lanie stopped at a shelf in the very back.
Pulled out a book with a cracked black spine.

“Have you ever read The Ones We Forgot?”

I shook my head.

“It’s about a woman who starts remembering things that never happened to her. Lives that aren’t hers. But they feel like they are.”

I stared at the cover: a house drawn in sketchy lines, all the windows black—except for one, faintly glowing.

“That sounds…” I hesitated. “Familiar.”

She tilted her head, watching me. “Yeah. I thought it might.”

There was something sharp in my chest then. Not pain, exactly.
Recognition.
Like I’d seen that house before.
Like I’d stood behind that glowing window.

“I get those sometimes,” I murmured. “Little flashes. Not quite memories. More like… echoes.”

Lanie didn’t say anything.
Just reached out and squeezed my hand.

And for a second, I wanted to pull away—not because it felt wrong, but because it felt known. Too known.

A few nights later, Lanie came over.

It was the first time I’d let her see my apartment.
I don’t invite people in.
Not because I’m unfriendly—but because my space is sacred.
Structured.
Safe.

It’s a third-floor walk-up above an old hardware store that smells like nails and turpentine. The stairs creak. The hallway hums with fluorescent buzz. But inside—it’s quiet.

Neutral walls. Pale, soft light.
Furniture that serves its purpose. No clutter. No color.
Everything has its place.
A photograph of a mountain I’ve never climbed.
A stack of notebooks by the window, arranged by size and date.
A candle I never light.
A couch I never nap on.

Lanie looked around, and for a moment, I saw it through her eyes.
Spare. Clinical. Maybe even a little lonely.

But she didn’t say any of that.
She just smiled and held up the wine.

We sat on the couch with a movie playing low in the background. She brought caramel popcorn in a crinkled plastic bag and laughed through the dumbest scenes. I didn’t. I couldn’t seem to focus.

At one point, I felt her eyes on me.

“What?” I asked.

“You looked… different just now.”

“Different how?”

“Like you were somewhere else.”

I blinked. “Maybe I was.”

Lanie leaned her head back against the cushion, watching me from the side. “Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you’d just… turned left instead of right one day?”

I swallowed. “I don’t really like to think about that.”

“But you do.”

Again, that tone.
Not judgment. Just certainty.

And again—I didn’t answer.

Something about her felt like a mirror I wasn’t ready to look into.

A long silence settled. The kind that fills the room with questions neither of us asked.

Then she shifted.

“I should go,” she said, already rising.

“You don’t have to.”

“I know,” she said, her voice small.

I followed her to the door.

She paused before leaving.
Turned to look at me.

“Thanks for letting me in.”

It sounded heavier than it should’ve.

Then she walked out into the hallway.
Her boots echoed all the way down the stairs.

Later that night I woke up on the floor.

The hardwood was cold against my cheek.
My hands were curled beneath me like I’d braced for impact.

The microwave clock blinked: 3:11 a.m.
The TV was on—but nothing played. Just static, humming faintly.

I sat up slowly, body aching.
I couldn’t remember falling asleep.
I couldn’t remember going to bed.

But I had been dreaming. I was sure of it.

The images slipped away the moment I opened my eyes—but one stuck.

A long white hallway.
Windowless.
Endless.
The air was thick, muffled.
And gouged into the wall at uneven intervals—
The number 9.
Carved again and again like someone had done it with shaking hands.

I stood, dazed.
The fridge beeped.
The lamps blinked back on.
All the digital clocks reset.

The power had gone out.

I walked to the window.

Across the street, the café was dark.

Except for one light glowing from the back—
the office, I think.
The room I’d never seen inside.

It stayed on, steady and soft.

Like someone had never left.

Like someone was waiting.
Or watching.
Or remembering. 



chapter three
Patterns

I woke up already dressed.

Jeans creased, shirt bunched at the waist like I had tossed and turned in it all night. My notebook lay open on the floor beside the bed, pen still tucked in the spiral. I must have been writing before I fell asleep.

There was only one line on the page:

ask lanie abt the dream

I stared at it, the letters uneven like I’d written them in a hurry—or half-asleep. I didn’t remember writing it. I didn’t remember dreaming either. 
I shut the notebook and sat on the edge of the bed, letting my feet touch the floor for a long time before I stood up. Something felt… off. Not wrong, just shifted. Like the room had been moved an inch to the left while I wasn’t looking.

Outside, the sky was washed in that pale blue haze that always came just before a storm. The air was warm but unsettled. I kept thinking I could smell rain, though nothing had fallen yet.

The café sat like a steady fixture on the corner—same soft light, same chipped wood sign, same rustling of newspaper pages and ceramic mugs clinking together. I went there every morning because it was predictable. Because I didn’t have to think about anything once I stepped through the door.

Lanie was already behind the counter, wiping the espresso machine down with a towel slung over her shoulder. She glanced up the second I walked in. Her expression was neutral but familiar, like she’d seen this version of me before.

“Morning,” she said, her voice smooth but careful. “You okay?”

“I think so,” I said, but it sounded like a question.

She didn’t push. “The usual?”

I nodded, and she turned without another word.

I took my seat by the window, notebook still in hand. I didn’t open it yet. Just sat there watching the light shift across the table, tracing the steam that curled from a stranger’s cup two seats down. My own drink arrived minutes later—warm, sweet, grounding.

When Lanie placed the cup in front of me, she didn’t walk away. Instead, she hesitated like she wanted to say something, then slid into the seat across from me.

“You look like you didn’t sleep,” she said.

I smiled faintly. “I don’t remember.”

That made her eyebrows lift, just slightly. She didn’t speak, but I felt the shift between us. Like I’d confirmed something she’d already suspected.

I flipped open my notebook, turned it toward her, and tapped the single line.
ask lanie about the dream

Her face didn’t change much, but her shoulders stiffened just enough for me to notice.

“I don’t remember writing it,” I said. “Or dreaming.”

Lanie leaned back in the chair, studying me with a softness that didn’t quite hide her caution.

“Sometimes we remember the feeling before we remember the details,” she said.

“Have I said anything before?” I asked. “About a dream?”

She hesitated. Then: “Not with words.”

That made my stomach tighten. “What does that mean?”

Lanie glanced toward the window, then back at me.

“It means your body knows things your mind hasn’t caught up to yet.”

I looked down at the notebook again. The handwriting was definitely mine. And yet, it felt like a stranger had written it.

“Was it… a bad dream?” I asked.

She didn’t answer right away. Then, quietly:
“I think it was something you needed to see again.”

My heart tapped against my ribs, too light to be a full panic, too loud to ignore.

I wrapped my hands around the cup, holding onto the heat like it could anchor me.

“Will it come back?” I asked.

Lanie’s voice was gentler this time. “Only if you’re ready.”

When I stepped outside, the air had shifted. A breeze kicked up, thick with the scent of wet concrete. The clouds had rolled in without warning, sudden and heavy.

I started walking home, one hand still wrapped around the now-empty cup.

As I passed a shuttered storefront, something caught my eye in the reflection of the glass. Not my face, but behind it—
a flash of red fabric, and the silhouette of a child’s hand pressed to a fogged window.

I turned sharply.

There was no one there.

But my heart was racing. My palms were damp. And I could hear something, faint and sharp in my ears:

A lullaby.
Soft. Crooked. Half-familiar.
And suddenly, I could smell fire.



chapter four
The restoration 

The rain came just after sunset.
Not a storm, just a steady fall that soaked the streets and blurred the glow of traffic lights outside my window. It was the kind of rain that quiets everything else, the kind that makes you feel like the world has been gently placed on pause.

I hadn’t turned on the lights. I didn’t need them. I sat curled up on the couch, my notebook open in my lap but untouched since this morning. The words were still there, circled once in shaky pen:

ask lanie about the dream

I still didn’t remember writing it. Still didn’t remember dreaming anything at all. But I remembered showing her. I remembered the way Lanie looked at me after she read it—something between recognition and concern. Like she’d been holding something back until I was ready to ask.

A soft knock pulled me from my thoughts. Three quiet taps.

I stood and walked slowly to the door. When I looked through the peephole, I wasn’t surprised to see her standing there.

Lanie.

Rain in her hair, arms crossed like she was holding herself together.

I opened the door.

“Hey,” she said, voice warm but cautious. “I know it’s late. I wasn’t sure if I should come, but… after this morning, I figured maybe it would help.

“It’s okay,” I said. “I’m glad you’re here.”

The rain had quieted by the time Lanie came.

Not stopped — just softened. Like the world was holding its breath.

She stood in the doorway in her oversized hoodie, her hair damp and clinging to her cheeks. I stepped aside to let her in.

The room was dim, glowing faintly from the streetlight outside. We sat on the couch, the silence between us thick but not uncomfortable.

I held my notebook loosely in my lap, open to the page she’d seen that morning at the café.

ask lanie about the dream

She looked at it again but didn’t smile this time. Her expression was solemn. Present.

“I wasn’t sure I should come,” she said after a while, voice low. “But if it were me… I think I’d want someone to tell me the truth. Even if it hurt.”

I nodded.

Lanie sat back, hands clasped in her lap like she needed to ground herself.

“I was raised in a place called The Restoration,” she said. “It wasn’t a church. Not exactly. But they talked about God like they’d met Him personally. Like He whispered rules to them in the dark.”

She exhaled slowly.

“They had rules. Dozens of them. But their core belief was that every third child born was a curse. That every third life tipped the balance toward destruction. So they had a system. A brutal, unwavering rule.”

I didn’t speak. I couldn’t.

“They called it the Balance Doctrine. Every third child had to be removed. For the ‘good of the world.’ They didn’t call it killing. They said it was cleansing. Purifying. A holy offering.”

Lanie’s voice didn’t rise. It didn’t need to. The calmness made it worse.

“I had a sister,” she said. “Her name was Miriam. She was born just after midnight. We were a family of  three for twenty minutes.”

I watched her eyes go somewhere far away.

“I remember my mother holding her. Still bleeding, still shaking. My dad wasn’t even allowed in the room. It was just her, and me watching from the hallway. Miriam was tiny — red-faced, wrapped in the only blanket we weren’t supposed to use. My mom hummed to her. Sang the way mothers do when no one’s listening.”

Her voice went softer.

“Then they came. The same night. Dressed in white robes. Heads covered. Holding lanterns that glowed an ominous red color.  They didn’t ask. They didn’t wait. They took her from my mother’s arms while she was still crying into the sheets.”

My throat burned. My whole body had gone cold.

“They didn’t do it quickly,” she whispered. “That would’ve been mercy. They had a ritual. I won’t tell you all of it. But I watched. I was standing on the stairs.”

Her eyes looked glassy, distant.

“She didn’t scream. My mom. She never screamed. That was one of the rules. Crying was weakness. Pain was sacred. You had to feel it, not express it. And if you broke that—if you made a sound—you were punished.”

I swallowed hard. “Punished how?”

Lanie looked down at her hands, turning her thumbs over each other.

“You weren’t allowed to speak during daylight unless granted permission. You couldn’t show emotion unless it was joy. Even that could be punished if it looked unnatural.”

Her voice was steady, but there was something brittle underneath it. Like a thin sheet of ice over a frozen lake.

“If you broke a rule—even something small—they sent you to The Silence Room. It was underground. No windows. No sound. You’d go in barefoot, wearing just a white linen shift. You’d stay there until they said you’d learned your lesson.”

She paused.

Sometimes days. Sometimes longer. They fed you water through a slot in the floor—just enough to keep you alive, never enough to feel human. They didn’t let you sleep. If you tried, they’d blast recordings through the walls—crying, screaming, alarms that spiked at random intervals until you couldn’t tell if they were real or inside your skull. The darkness was total—so complete it felt alive. Your eyes would ache from trying to find shapes in the black. You started seeing things that weren’t there. Smells, too. Burning plastic. Rotting meat. Your own skin.
Time stopped making sense. Hunger twisted into nausea, then into a kind of hollow buzzing in your bones. Your body ate itself in slow degrees. Muscles shook. Your thoughts scattered. Some people screamed. Others went quiet, too quiet. One girl bit off part of her own finger—just to feel something. Another went mute for six months. One boy laughed so hard he broke his own teeth. And sometimes you’d think you heard someone whispering right next to you, but no one was there. You were never touched—but it always felt like something was waiting in the dark, breathing behind your ear.
My chest ached just listening.

“They didn’t believe in love,” Lanie continued. “Said it made you selfish. If two people got too close, they’d separate them. Make them forget. Erase their names from each other.”

She looked at me then.

“One day, my mother was just… gone. No goodbye. No explanation. They said I’d become too dependent. That meant they wiped her. Gave her a new name. A new purpose. Maybe a new child to raise. Or maybe they locked her away and told her to forget me.”

A long silence.

“And the worst part?” Her voice dropped. “After a while… you start to believe them. That you deserve it. That it’s your fault. That you were born wrong.”

My hands were trembling.

Lanie’s eyes met mine — not accusing, not pitying. Just knowing.

“I don’t remember any of this,” I whispered. “Not for me. Nothing like that.”

She gave a small, sad smile.

“I didn’t either,” she said. “Not at first. For years, I thought I had a vivid imagination. I’d get flashes. Smells. Words I didn’t understand. I’d wake up screaming from dreams I couldn’t explain.”

I looked down at my notebook. At the empty margins. At the line I’d written that morning, like some part of me already knew.

ask lanie about the dream

Lanie leaned closer.

“I told you this because I see something in you, Emily. The way you watch everything. The way you remember so little, but feel so much. That’s what it felt like. That’s what it still feels like.”

My throat was tight. My whole body felt like it was vibrating, but I couldn’t tell from what. Fear? Grief? Recognition?

“I’m not saying it’s the same,” Lanie said. “But something happened to you. And whatever it is… you don’t have to go through it alone.”

She reached across the couch and gently took my hand.

“I can’t promise it won’t hurt,” she said. “But I can promise I won’t leave you in it.”

I didn’t speak.

But I didn’t pull away either.

Outside, the rain started again—soft, steady, quiet as breath.

And for the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel completely alone.



chapter five
Dream Logic

After she told me everything—the robes, the rituals, the baby taken bleeding from her mother’s arms—Lanie went quiet.

She just sat there on the edge of the couch, staring at her hands. Not crying. Just gone, like she’d crawled deep inside herself and shut the door behind her.

“They burned the third child’s name,” she said finally. “So no one could speak it again. Like it erased the soul.”

I couldn’t find any words. I felt like I’d swallowed broken glass.

“You can stay here tonight,” I said, my voice too thin, too normal.

She nodded. “Please.”

I gave her a blanket, a shirt of mine to sleep in, and left the lamp on. She didn’t ask for that, but I think we both knew she wouldn’t sleep if the dark took the room completely.

I lay in bed for a long time, staring at the ceiling. Listening. I couldn’t tell if it was Lanie’s breathing I heard… or something else.

Eventually, sleep took me.

I was in the hallway again. My hallway. But longer. Warped.

The walls pulsed like lungs, like something was breathing just beneath the drywall. A deep, wet inhale. A slower, strained exhale.

My bedroom door was closed.

Something was behind it.

I reached for the handle. My hand was shaking. I turned it.

Inside, the room was dark. Too dark. The shadows were thick, solid, curling like vines along the ceiling.

Someone was lying in my bed. On their side. Hair the color of dried blood spilled across the pillow.

Me.

My body. Still and small and peaceful. My lips moved, whispering something. I leaned in.

“Don’t wake up,” I said. “It’s worse when you wake up.”

The voice wasn’t mine.

The walls peeled open like wet paper. Suddenly I was outside. On a street swallowed by fog.

A traffic light blinked red above me—slow, rhythmic, like a heartbeat.

Figures appeared in the distance. Gliding. No footsteps. White robes dragging on the concrete, sopping with something thick and black. Their faces hidden by veils of stained linen.

“You let her in,” they said.
“You let her in.”
“You let her in.”

I turned to run. But the fog pulled at my legs, thick like syrup. Something sharp scraped across the pavement behind me.

A child’s cry echoed through the air—wet and sudden, cut off mid-scream.

I spun around—

Lanie was standing in the road.

But she wasn’t Lanie.

Her face was cracked down the center like shattered porcelain. Her eyes were hollow, pupils stretching outward into black spirals. Her fingers twitched unnaturally. One arm too long. Her mouth opened—jaw unhinging.

“You were supposed to die,” she whispered. “You were the third.”

Her smile was a wound. Her teeth—there were too many.

I screamed—


And woke up.

Sweating. Cold. My sheets soaked. My heart sprinting.

I sat up, hands gripping the edge of the mattress. Tried to breathe.

A dream. Just a dream.

The apartment was quiet. My room was still.

I got out of bed and opened the door slowly.

The lamp in the living room was still on.

Lanie was sitting on the couch. Back straight. Perfectly still.

“Lanie?” I whispered.

She didn’t respond.

I stepped closer. She wasn’t blinking. Her eyes were locked on the wall across from her, wide and wet and shining.

“Lanie?”

She turned her head. Not like a person. Like a marionette. One single jerk of the neck. Her face slack.

“There are three of you now,” she said. Her voice layered—hers and something beneath it, something old and rotted. “Only one can stay.”

Her mouth stretched wide, and something started pushing out of it—long, gray, wet.

I stumbled back.

And then the walls screamed.

Not figuratively. They screamed—a thousand voices layered into one shrieking wail. Paint peeled, lights exploded in bursts of sparks. The apartment bled.

I turned to run—but the hallway folded like paper, collapsing into itself. Lanie stood in the doorway, her hands burning, her skin sloughing off like wax.

“You were never out,” she said. “You only think you woke up.”


I jolted awake.

The real kind. I think.

My mouth was dry. My heart thundered. The room was dark, normal-dark. The ceiling didn’t breathe.

But I didn’t move. Not right away.

Finally, I opened my bedroom door.

Lanie was still there—on the couch, asleep, arms wrapped around herself.

Quiet. Human.

But I couldn’t stop staring at her face.

Because in the dream… her eyes had looked exactly the same.

And part of me still wasn’t sure I was awake.


chapter six 
Not Really Awake


The smell of coffee pulled me out of the fog.

Weak sunlight crept through the window above the sink, casting long, dusty streaks across the hardwood floor. For a second, I didn’t know where I was—then the sound of the percolating coffee pot brought it back. My apartment. Morning. Real.

Lanie stood at the counter, barefoot, wearing one of my old oversized sleep shirts—the faded navy one with the stretched neckline and frayed hem. It fell just above her knees, the sleeves too long, nearly swallowing her hands. Her black hair was a tousled mess, but the two blonde streaks in the front framed her face in soft curls, catching the morning light like ribbons of gold.

She looked calm. Too calm.

Her posture was loose, comfortable. Her expression was soft. She stirred sugar into her mug with the kind of ease that belonged to someone who felt safe. Her presence filled the kitchen like it belonged there.

Not like the thing I saw in my dream.

Not like the creature with spiral-black eyes and too many teeth.

When she looked up, her eyes were their normal color. Just hazel. Tired, maybe. But warm.

“You didn’t sleep,” she said, already pouring a second mug. Her voice was steady. Normal.

I tried to laugh it off, but it came out dry. “Was it that obvious?”

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I took the coffee and sat at the edge of the couch. My hands trembled slightly, but the ceramic was warm and solid. It helped.

Lanie leaned back against the counter, one foot tucked behind the other. She wore my shirt like it was hers, like it had always been hers. I tried to shake off the feeling of dread curling in my stomach, but it clung to me like humidity.

“You ever have a dream that just… won’t let go?” I asked.

She raised an eyebrow. “Let me guess. I was in it?”

I nodded slowly. “It was more like… you were and you weren’t. You looked like you, but you said things—awful things. That I was part of them. That I was the third.”

Lanie’s smile faded. She looked down at her cup, then back at me. Her expression had gone still.

“Dreams like that… they don’t just come from nowhere,” she said. “Sometimes your brain’s trying to piece things together before you’re ready.”

“You think I’m remembering something?” I asked, my voice lower now. “Something real?”

“I think,” she said carefully, “that your brain knows more than it lets on.”

We sat in silence for a long moment. The only sound was the quiet clink of her spoon against the ceramic.

Then she glanced up at the clock.

“Shit,” she muttered. “I’m gonna be late.”

“For work?”

She nodded, already turning toward the hallway. “Yeah. My shift starts at nine. Do you think I could borrow something to wear? I wasn’t really planning on crashing here.”

“Of course.” I stood too fast, almost spilling my coffee.

Lanie tilted her head slightly. “You okay?”

“Yeah. Just still… off.”

I ducked into my bedroom and grabbed a pair of jeans I thought might fit her, plus one of my favorite cardigans—a soft, oversized gray one, worn at the sleeves. Something about offering it to her felt strangely intimate, like giving away a piece of myself.

When I handed her the clothes, her smile returned—soft and sincere.

“Thanks,” she said, running a thumb over the edge of the cardigan. “You really didn’t have to.”

“I wanted to,” I said, and meant it. “It’ll look good on you.”

She nodded and padded down the hall to the bathroom.

The door clicked shut behind her.

I stood in the silence she left behind and watched the way the morning light stretched across the carpet. I should’ve felt comforted.

But instead, I stared at the spot she’d been standing and couldn’t shake the feeling that part of the dream was still here—waiting, just behind her eyes.

About 20 minutes later I got ready like I always do.

Shower. Brush teeth. Moisturizer. Light swipe of nude lip balm. No makeup—never. I kept my look simple, natural. My clothes were soft, neutral tones—beige blouse, tan trousers—something to blend in, not stand out. Shoes lined up exactly where they belong by the front door. I moved through the motions like muscle memory, but it all felt just a second off. Like someone had rearranged the script behind my back.

I left ten minutes later than usual.

The walk to work was the same path I always took, but the streets felt unfamiliar—like I was walking through a city built to look like mine. The stoplights seemed to flicker at the edges. The crosswalk sign glitched for a second, then reset itself.

My office building loomed ahead, sterile and beige and familiar. I walked through the automatic doors, smiled weakly at the receptionist, and tried to pretend everything was fine.

But it wasn’t.

I was behind from the second I sat down at my desk. My emails were already piling up. I forgot to flag a client request. I snapped at someone who asked for help with a printer jam—me, who always kept her cool. My fingers trembled on the keyboard. I misread reports. Missed calls. Forwarded the wrong spreadsheet.

Around noon, the message popped up on my screen:

Jay wants to see you. When you get a sec.

My stomach dropped.

I stood, legs slightly unsteady, and walked down the hallway toward his office. His door was open.

He smiled when he saw me. “Hey, Em. Come in. Shut the door?”

That was worse than the message.

I obeyed and sat in the chair across from his desk.

Jay folded his hands on top of a stack of files. “You okay?”

“I—yeah. Just a rough night.”

“You’re usually the most reliable person on this floor,” he said gently. “But today’s… not like you.”

I looked down at my hands. They were clenched in my lap, knuckles white.

“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to mess anything up.”

“You didn’t mess up,” he said quickly. “You’re just… not here. Mentally. That’s not a crime. But I need to ask—are you okay? Really?”

I opened my mouth to lie, but something in his tone stopped me. It wasn’t judgment. It was concern. Real concern.

“I think I’m just… overwhelmed,” I said. “Something personal. It’s been—hard to shake.”

Jay nodded. “Take a little time to breathe. Catch up when you can. Let me know if you need anything. Okay?”

I nodded, grateful and embarrassed all at once.

Back at my desk, I stared at my screen.

There were no robed figures. No voices. No spiraling black eyes.

Just Excel. And an inbox full of unread emails.

Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very, very wrong.

And that whatever it was… it had followed me.

1misupz,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1misupz/baby_not_interacting/,Baby not interacting..,"Hi guys, 

I am a first time mom and i have begun to grow concern about how my baby isn’t really interactive or doing anything other than just being a potato…

For context, he is 5 months old and has mild hypotonia (low muscle tone) which is improving.

He can’t roll, babble or play with toys. He can grasp toys if I put it in front of him but it usually just goes into his mouth.

He doesn’t make eye contact with me or dad if we hold him infront of us but does make it form a far when we are walking around the house or picking him up fork the crib.

He is very observant and just kinda watches everything, including coffee cups, dangling toys, TV is big. He will watch tv for 30 minutes if we let him (which we don’t) He doesn’t really smile until we make a silly face or sound.

I have also noticed that he doesn’t really look at us when we call his name or speak to him when he is busy being observant.

The delay in gross motor skills makes sense to me due to his hypotonia but I don’t understand the cognitive delays.

I also forgot to mention that he is very sensitive to noise and jerks at almost everything like a simple clap infront of his face, makes him blink

1missnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1missnr/gave_up_on_the_one_thing_i_wanted_most_now_what/,Gave up on the ONE thing i wanted most. Now what?,"I feel a bit empowered to post here after commenting on a (maybe not so) similar post over the weekend.

I recently gave up on ever finding my husband and starting a family: the thing i wanted the most.

I (f29) have really struggled to date. I live in this paradoxical state where men don’t notice me and are not attracted to me (I don’t get approached or asked out on dates and I am one of the very few girls who got ZERO matches on dating apps) and yet, men find me attractive enough to want to have sex with me.

Recently, i realized that I actually may never find the love I want and really thought I’d experience. I will never find my husband: a man who is equitable in emotional and home labor, who takes care of himself, is monogamous, who protects me, who has a good relationship with his family, narcotics-free, makes me feel emotionally and physically safe, puts in just as much as I do, shares similar values, wants to be a father, wants to be MY husband, and is my best friend. I mean, I see my friends in these relationships so I know men like this exist, but *I* won’t be able to experience this. And I came to this conclusion after taking stock of my life and dating. 

I turn 30 this year with no romantic prospects. I go out, I have a great life, an ok job, active in communities, have cool hobbies and interests, travel (A LOT), and have a good relationship with my family—and yet, I have had very little success in dating throughout my life and more so now. Men will come up to my friends and ask them out. My friends get lots of interest on apps and at events. I just kind of exist, but not really—I’m quite invisible. Not just in my hometown (which is a major US city) but everywhere I travel. Am I ugly? No. But am I conventionally “Western beauty standard” attractive? Also no. So could be that. But again, they express they want to fuck me, but never to get to know me or be with me romantically—in the States, and across the other 4 continents I’ve been to. I turn 30, my parents are heading towards their 70s, and I have no movement romantically despite my best efforts, and giving all the love I had.

So, I put my big girl panties on and realized I’m just one of those people who won’t ever get to experience this. And it hurts. It really does. I want it so bad. I’ve cried to God and the universe. I’ve cried to my therapist. My friends. My parents. And despite everyone thinking (believing?) otherwise and telling me to be positive, things don’t look up for me. I wanted to be a mom. Not a babymom. Not a single married mom. I wanted a family. My husband. My child(ren). I wanted the love I know exists for others, but very clearly doesn’t for me. I’ve always wanted a loving family, my own. The one I create with the man I love, who loves me and is on the same page on life, love, home, and family. I wanted a quiet engagement in a winter cabin over coffee. A wedding down at the courthouse and pancakes after. 2 kids. But i cant keep losing my mind over this. 

The days pass, the years pass, and I’m moving farther and farther away from that goal, and not by choice. I’ve tried so hard, but I have come to terms that I am one of those people who will never find the love they desire; who will never have the family they crave.

So what now? I turn 30 this year. I have nothing tying me to my hometown, so maybe I’ll move. Maybe I’ll quit my job. I have nothing to strive for really. My professional goals were always tied to financial stability to raise a family (i wanted to be a SAHM for the first few years so having those professional networks and savings to help get back into the labor market afterwards) because i dont want to raise my kids in poverty like in the community i was born and raised into. But i REALLY don’t care for the corporate ladder. Or working honestly. Or any of this career woman bullshit. I worked this hard because I was working for my future family—the one I now realize I won’t have. 

I love traveling. I feel so happy when I’m away. So fuck it, I have everywhere to call home. I can live in a van, or live in hotels, or airbnbs, or just fuck off and do nothing. I have nothing stopping me or rooting me to any one location!

I love smoking cigarettes but I gave that up because all the guys I’d go on dates with hated smokers and I realized this (bad) habit is decreasing my dating pool, but I have no dating pool; so I’ll get myself a pack of Marlboros tomorrow!

I’m of course blowing off some steam because i’m so damn angry, and at the same time overwhelmed with the possibilities I can explore. I can literally do anything. Fuck my elite university degrees and everything I worked for in the name of stability and my future family. I turn 30 this year. A few more years and soon barren. Still single. No prospects. So now what? What’s next?

I don’t know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed and like i’m losing it. I gave up the one thing I’ve always wanted, and now I have no direction. I genuinely don’t know what to do now. I could do so much now that i’m “free”. But what? ",1,1754447229.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

I’m working on a passion project — building a brand‑new salon suite space here in GA — and I want to make it as close to perfect as possible for **stylists**. I’m starting with a blank slate and want to hear from the people who actually live behind the chair every day.

Here’s what I’ve got in mind so far:

* A reception area that feels warm, welcoming, and elevated for your clients
* Break room with a real kitchenette + good coffee (because you deserve better than break‑room sludge)
* Onsite laundry so you’re not lugging towels home
* Fast, reliable fiber‑backed Wi‑Fi
* Every suite has its own sink + cabinetry, no matter your setup
* **24/7 secured access** so you can work early mornings, late nights, or whenever your clients need you — without safety worries

But if you could design your perfect space from scratch… **what would you add?**  
Could be anything from practical must‑haves (storage, lighting, layout) to dream‑level perks that make your day easier and your clients happier.

At first, he seemed nice. Friendly, chatty, harmless. Then he started calling me his ""work wife"" during casual convos with other coworkers. The first time I kind of laughed it off, assuming he was just being goofy or trying to fit in.

But it’s become a regular thing. Like, anytime we’re in a group and I offer to grab coffee or bring him something from the kitchen, he’ll make a comment like ""See? She takes care of me like a real wife"" or ""That’s why she’s my work wife."" At first people would laugh awkwardly, but now it’s just crickets. Even our boss gave him a weird look the last time he said it.

I’ve tried to subtly distance myself, stopped doing small favors, kept things super professional. But he still keeps dropping those comments, and it’s starting to make me uncomfortable. I don’t want to cause drama, but I also don’t think this is okay anymore.

Has anyone dealt with something like this? How do you shut this kind of thing down without making it a whole HR situation (unless it needs to go that route)?",39,1754447138.0,coworkerstories,28,0.98,False

You go to your pharmacy and end up taking a PPI that has like a 50% chance of working and 50% chance of not working, and the time it takes for the process to obtain this is even worse. 

This is why the new, best solution to this is [Claisen](https://www.claisen.com/). Claisen isn't a regular gut-health company. It focuses on your symptoms relating to heartburn, gas, nausea, sore throat, hoarse throat, bad breath, asthma, hiccups, burping, acid reflux, GERD, bloating, the list goes on and on. It provides you a[ short, simple quiz ](https://app.claisen.com/quiz/demo)that allows you to quickly fill out your demographics and context of your symptoms. Soon after, you receive an affordable monthly kit that delivers to your doorstep. None of that having to wait in tedious settings just to receive a prescription that might not even work. 

Even if you don't think your problems relate to GERD or acid reflux, Claisen's personalized quiz can help with any problems relating to bloating, heartburn, chest pain, hoarse throat, shortness of breath, regurgitation, chronic cough, vomit, etc. I've heard of many testimonies of people having their GI health problems being fixed in a few days through Claisen's personalization approach.

And another thing is that Claisen also has lots of good information relating to heartburn, acid reflux, bloating, and more in specific situations whether that be during [pregnancy](https://www.claisen.com/blogs/heartburn/the-ultimate-guide-to-stopping-acid-reflux-during-pregnancy), drinking [wine](https://www.claisen.com/blogs/heartburn/how-to-enjoy-wine-without-getting-heartburn), after [consuming sushi,](https://www.claisen.com/blogs/heartburn/why-do-i-get-acid-reflux-after-eating-sushi) after consuming a [monster energy drink](https://www.claisen.com/blogs/heartburn/how-to-stop-acid-reflux-after-drinking-monster-energy-step-by-step), drinking [coffee](https://www.claisen.com/blogs/heartburn/how-to-drink-coffee-without-getting-acid-reflux-a-step-by-step-guide), and [so much more.](https://www.claisen.com/pages/blogs) ",1,1754446939.0,claisen,0,1.0,False

About a month ago I noticed some white dots and green/yellow at the very back of my tongue. I self-diagnosed oral thrush using Dr. Google and began salt-water rinses, using Peroxyl mouthwash, cutting out coffee, sugar, and carbs, and eating yoghurt for a few weeks to no avail. I saw a Doctor who diagnosed me with oral thrush and said my tonsils were also very red and inflamed. She suspected my thrush was caused due to antibiotics taken at the start of the year after having my wisdom teeth removed or due to a simple imbalance.

\* I have been screened for all STDS/STIS and tested negative so she does not suspect that is an underlying cause. She informed me that this is not contagious. I have kissed my boyfriend and woohooed since noticing symptoms and he has not demonstrated signs of oral thrush or candidiasis anywhere. She also told me changing my diet will not be necessary and she was confident my oral thrush case was mild and would be fine with treatment.



I have had iron deficiency in the past and received an infusion roughly a year ago. I may ask her if my iron levels may be causing this.

She prescribed me Fungilin (Amphotericin B) lozenges and said to take 4 a day for a week. Unfortunately that number was close to 2 a day as I was really busy and around people. I felt embarrassed taking them around people and didn't want people to ask what it was or see the label clearly indicating I have a fungal infection which they may think is contagious. I did finish the whole bottle eventually however I was not taking them at the consistent and prescribed rate which I really regret. My symptoms did not fully go away however they appeared much better.

A week later I have noticed an itchy red rash around my mouth and symptoms gradually reverting back to pre-treatment. I have booked a Dr appointment for tomorrow. I do have a repeat of the lozenges she gave me which I can pick up however I do not want to re begin treatment without her approval. I am also on the oral contraceptive pill which I cannot stop taking and am worried taking antifungals may decrease the effectiveness of my pill.

What do I do? Do I need to just take lozenges or do I need a combination of lifestyle changes i.e. cutting out carbs and coffee? Will I possibly infect my boyfriend? Do you think I have any other underlying causes?

I really don't know what to do.",1,1754446870.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

I've read The Green Witch (by Arin Murphy-Hiscock) and done some online research. 

I've seen some beautiful examples of how witches bring practice into their everyday - often slow mornings and intentional cooking - which don't fit my current season of life. I'm a working mum to twin toddlers (nearly 3) and finding it tricky to balance witchy practices with the beautiful chaos of little ones. 

I love the idea of intention and ritual, but I'll try to sweep negative energy while breaking up fights or cleaning up food explosions. Sometimes I wonder if I'm adding more chaos than what I've cleaned haha 

Some wins I've had:   
With my twins - Cinnamon washed the front door (cute), cooking pancakes & harvesting flowers (cute and chaotic) 

By myself - Blessing my coffee/tea, stirring love into our food, using moon water for my daily coffee/tea and clothes washing, dropping oil into my shower 

I'd love to hear from mum witches with little kids - what are your go-to practices? How do you find pockets to make magic? What helps you have a good mindset? Any moon rituals that don't require perfect quiet?

The first was just coffee and the second (6 days ago) was a long night of dinner and drinks. We made out several times in the bar and parking lot and then he called me on the way home to say what a good time he had and that he was looking forward to the next date. I went out of town the following day and he texted me throughout the duration of my trip. He asked for pics of what I was doing, what i was wearing, etc. I was surprised he talked so much and was eager to get back and see him. 

Yesterday I came home, and after exchanging several texts that morning and afternoon, I said I would be less bummed about coming home if we had our next date planned. He did not reply for 8 hours (unlike him) and apologized saying he was at a family function. He asked about my trip and said he would like to plan a getaway with me.  No mention of our next date. Today he texted me to say good morning, but other than 2 texts early in the afternoon, it’s been radio silence. I am assuming he’s going on dates with other girls (he is VERY good looking and new to the area so he has a lot of options online). I’m understanding of that, but I’m not going to have our communication drop off now that I’m home and he’s likely trying to juggle dates. 

I really like him and don’t want things to become stagnant while he is potentially exploring other options. He was chattier while I wae gone, I  assume because i wasn’t asking about plans then? Any thoughts on what I can do/say to get the ball rolling?

You still refuse to talk to me, to listen , to communicate beyond a few words on messenger or texts that just rage and scream at me to go away. Blame shifting and gaslighting when I ask for clarity about something vague you said  . Then get blocked and you change your number.

When did you start to hate me so much? When did I become the one who you take out all your anger out on while  she gets the very best behavior?

She’s so many things that you claimed to dislike in a person . The music . The tattoos.  The piercings.  The style.  The loud and inconsiderate bossy vibe.  The hairstyle. The kids. Even the way she speaks was once annoying to you in other people. 
She’s the opposite of me on almost every way.   
You compare your relationship to your parents relationship. 
You call each other “ baby” constantly. Pictures on Facebook.  Your new tattoo that she branded onto you herself. …

You let her message me to make sure know that you hate me , you never want to see me again, and that you belong to her .

Starting June 1, I transitioned to a Mediterranean-style diet consisting mainly of chicken, salmon, vegetables, fruits, and popcorn. I typically drink 60–90 ml of water daily, along with two to three cups of coffee using almond milk and a teaspoon of raw cane sugar.

On June 2, I began taking Jarrow’s milk thistle (150 mg, two tablets daily) in addition to a daily vitamin supplement.

In July, I increased my fruit and nut intake, adding approximately three apples a day, two oranges, and pistachio nuts to my diet.

By the end of June I weight 138ish and no I bounce between 133-135lbs

We let him in and as he steped we looked it's condition and we guessed he was at least a couple of weeks on the street.   His neck had rope marks, grease stained all over as like he was kept tied somewhere.  
  
Zero barks, zero growls and we thought well it must belong to some neighbours, we posted pictures on the neighborhood facebook, no one recongmized him...  
  
The next day my GFs cat came to check him out, we thought, damn it's gonna be crazy,  again, zero barks, growls or anything.... calm AF.  
  
A day later I took him home... to the vet, and since then, his attitude hastn't change, still gentle but protective of his home and space...

I’ve had my old digital camera since college—bought it used for $50 back in 2015. At first, it was just a tool to snap party photos or vacation shots. But after my mom got sick a few years ago, I started using it daily to document small moments: her gardening, our morning coffee chats, even the way sunlight hit her favorite chair.  

Now she’s gone, and that camera feels like a time machine. I don’t care about its megapixels or lens quality anymore. It’s the scratches on the body from being dropped, the faded sticker I put on it during a road trip, and the thousands of unedited photos that make it irreplaceable.

I’m working on a passion project — building a brand‑new salon suite space here in GA — and I want to make it as close to perfect as possible for people like *us*.

Here’s what I’ve got planned so far:

* Pretty reception area that actually feels welcoming and luxurious
* Break room with a real kitchenette + coffee that doesn’t taste like sadness
* Onsite laundry (no more hauling towels home 🙌)
* Fast, reliable Wi‑Fi
* Every suite with its own sink + cabinets, no matter your specialty
* **24/7 secured access** so you can work on your own schedule without worrying about safety

But if you could design your own suite from scratch… **what would you add?**  
I’m talking anything from small workflow tweaks to big dream‑level features that would make your day easier and your clients happier.

Heolstor himself is also the pure aspect of Night so his power is 100% Night.

  
But what about the others? Adel's power seems mostly intrinsic, although it can be argued that his nearly godlike power is at least somehow amplified by Night. Gnoster and Faurtis kind of just skitter around being buggy boys. 

Also, do the Nightlords hang out with each other and chat? Is Heolstor their ""guild leader""? Imagine Libra and Fulghor having coffee together in the break room between boss battles. ",2,1754445831.0,Nightreign,4,0.75,False

I did not want to overdo it , i put a fancy dress (not too fancy) , did my hair , makeup etc. . I did not want anything to go wrong . We decided to meet at a local coffee spot , i did not want to give him my address straight away even after he insisted that he wants to come and pick me up .

I took an uber , arrived first , maybe like 5 minutes before so i sat down and waited . And if you find it boring so far this is where it started . He came in , he was the exact man i saw on the photos but ... HE HAD A PARROT ON HIS SHOULDER ! Okay , i thought thats weird but ill try to look past it , maybe its some prank or something . He came , hugged me , the usual . First bomb came when i asked him why did he brought his pet , he said : its not a pet , its my best friend ! I just stared , i cant even describe it but i was feeling so embarrassed in the moment . Right after i asked : okay ? But why would you bring it to our first date ? He said : I DONT GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT HIM , looked at the parrot , grabbed some kind of treat from his pocket and gave it to him with words ""Right tofi ?"" and started cuddling him with head .

After this i knew i had to get out and my only thoughts were how to end this so called date . Im a pretty straightforward person , so i told him that this is not going to work , without giving any explanation i stood up but he grabbed my hand and told me to sit down , and that he will make it up to me . My thoughts were that whatever , at least it will be one hell of a story one day , so i calmed down and we started talking , only one little thing was wrong . When i started talking , this parrot started making these weird squeeking sounds , EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the coffee shop was staring at me and how that parrot is making me look like a fool , but he did not seem to care , not even a little bit , still smiling and nodding . I stopped trying to talk after like 5th attempt to say the same sentence , my face all red from the anger mixed with embarrassment , stood up and screamed at him that it is unacceptable to bring a pet parrot to the first date , that this was the worst first date i have ever had , that he is idiot if he thought this was a good idea , and then i pointed at the parrot and shouted at him to shut the f up when someone is talking . I then rushed out of the shop and ran till i was at least 100 ft away . I immediately had to call my best friend and tell her what happened and she told me that i maybe overreacted a little .

So i need to know if im the bad one in this situation and hear some other perspective .

Since it was a fresh install and I wanted to mess around tuning it for power efficiency, I decided to start over and install Proxmox 9.0.

With default BIOS settings and no power tuning, I was shocked to see it idle at just 3–4W! After tuning BIOS and setting powertop to auto-tune (`powertop --auto-tune`), it now idles at 2–3W, with C9 package state residency as high as 93.5%.

Going from 16W down to 3–4W at idle, just from the upgrade to Debian 13 and the latest kernel, is an insane leap.

Major credit and thank you to the Proxmox team (and upstream Debian devs) for this incredible update!

We are in the process of opening a distillery in the Burlington / Oakville area. Obtaining licences from the province could take a few months, so in the interim, we are going to sell coffee, cold brew, espresso, and other drinks to generate revenue and ""buzz"". Once the distillery is running, we'll keep the cafe as well as it's complimentary.

We're looking for a barista with some experience working in a cafe. The location is a busy industrial area so we believe it's a perfect location for a coffee shop.

“Hiiiii, it’s so nice to finally meet you!”

“Hey, yeah, umm, glad we could finally do this.”

“Is everything ok?”

“Yeah… it’s just, you know that feeling where it's like you were in the middle of something really important, but then you can’t remember what it was for the life of you?”

“Haha, yessss! That’s actually how I live half my life. Shall we grab a table?”

“Yeah sure, sounds good.”

“I hope you don’t mind my choice, this is literally my favourite place in the whole universe.”

“‘Every Last Drop Cafe’, I can’t believe I’ve never even heard of it. I’ve lived in this area for years.”

“Oh my days, you are in for a treat! The coffee here is literally to die for.”

“Great, I could really go for a phat coff, my head feels like I’ve been hit by a truck. I’ll order for us off the QR, honestly the best thing to come out of the pandemic.”

“Oh totally, because the one thing the world needs less of is human connection. The wait staff should be over in a moment to take our order. Do you trust me to order for us?”

“Oh ok, what are you going to get for me?”

“Not sure yet. Reckon I’ll make a spur of the moment decision.""

“Suurrre. Do you have a favourite order here?”

“Oh no, I get something different every time I come. Variety is the spice of life, you know?”

“Oooh that's brave!”

“What can I say, I live life on the edge. Eggs Bennie one day, Acai Bowl the next. It’s a wild ride. One day, I even had just toast with jam.”

“Haha, wow, simmer down.”

“So, tell me about yourself. Who are you?”

“Well, I am a graphic designer. It’s a fun job but not the best pay to be honest.”

“I hardly think your job defines you. Who are you?”

“Yep fair, I grew up in a small town a few hours inland from here. I play the guitar and I run occasionally.”

“Hmm, and do you suppose those things are what defines you?”

“Umm, I mean I guess.”

“So if you stopped playing guitar, stopped running and you grew up in the town over, would you cease to exist?”

“Well obviously not. But that’s not what I’m saying.”

“What are you saying?”

“Those are just things that are a part of me.”

“Well I want to know who you are.”

“Ok… I suppose I am a kind, conscientious person more often than not. I enjoy spending time with friends, and making people laugh. Sometimes I get angry, sometimes sad. I enjoy life for the most part and hope to be a parent one day. How’s that?”

“Better, but you could say that about a thousand other people. What makes you, you?”

“I - I don’t know…”

“Now we’re getting somewhere!”

“I don’t understand what you’re asking! Aren’t I just the sum of my actions?”

“Are you?”

“Aren’t I?!”


“Are you?!”

“Spur of the moment doesn’t mean random, how am I supposed to order for someone I don’t know? Honestly, it's a miracle you’ve ever been able to order for yourself at this rate.”

“Wha - Uhhh. Who am I?”

“That’s what I’d like to know.”

“I’d say my friends think of me as a person they can open up to and be taken seriously, joke around with and not be taken too seriously. Someone who is smart yet certainly has dumb moments, though can laugh about it afterwards. I can sometimes be too loud and attention seeking, but that I am a good person.”

“Is that what your friends think of you, or what you think your friends think of you?”

“What’s the difference?”

“Well if any one of your friends appeared suddenly, and I asked them who you are, do you think any of them would say the same thing more or less?”

“I mean, probably not.”

“Dig a little deeper.”

“Ok, here goes nothing. I am the type of person that wants to be the smartest in the room. There is a voice that tells me if I am not, then I am not worthy. I strive to be the best version of myself so that I am never in a situation where I might be made to feel small. Sometimes I hate myself. If I skip gym I feel like I am pathetic, if I get bad feedback from a client I feel like a failure, if I get rejected by someone I end up feeling so unloveable it's unbearable. 
When I am alone I want to cry for no reason, but I can’t. It’s not that I am trying not to, I just can’t. And that pressure just keeps building, and building, and building. I am scared of what will happen if it eventually bursts. So I ignore it, I pretend it doesn’t exist. If I’m not at work I am either on the phone, at the bar or doing an activity so I don’t have to think about it. 
	That scares me. Because that gives the voices more and more power. Which makes me sad because I shouldn’t hate myself so much, I haven’t ever done anything worthy of so much hate. But then I feel weak for being sad, which starts the cycle all over again, and the pressure gets a little greater each time. Sometimes I will even hurt myself, and that actually helps, a little. That also makes me sad.”

“Who is sad?”

“I am.”

“Who?”

“Me, the me me. The me that's above… or deeper, than the other mes.”

“What other mes?”

“The voices. The me that says if I let people treat me like my dad used to treat me, then I should die. That’s not me. And the me that doesn’t let me play, because then I will be seen as immature and be rejected by everyone. That’s not me either.”

“Perhaps I have been asking the wrong question. Let me rephrase. Who are you you?”

“Uh, am I the ‘observer’?”

“The observer of what?”

“Of me?”

“So are you you, or some ‘observer’?”

“I - am - spirit.”

“Hi spirit, I’m dad.”

“Ha ha. I think what I mean is I am the core, the essence, the pure untarnished version of me that remains untouched by the world. That is still in there but just, deep. Too deep. I don’t know it, I haven’t ever met it.” 

“Hey, yeah I think we’re ready to order.”

“Great, what will you be having?”

“Could we please get two orders of the chocolate chip pancake stack, with extra whipped cream and syrup? Aaaand two orio thick shakes as well?”

“Excelent choice, coming right up.”

“Wowowow, I would never order that!”

“Too late.”

“Do you know how bad that is for you, I don’t want that.”

“Well too bad, I wasn’t ordering for you. I was ordering for you you. How does you you feel about that?”

“I - I - I’m actually really excited!”

“Good! Get keen, they use proper crushed up Belgium chocolate for the chips, I hear.”

“OooOooh.”

“Hi, it’s nice to finally meet you!”

“What do you mean?”

“I’ve been around the block enough times to know when I am actually speaking to someone.”

“But I haven’t changed, I’m still me.”

“Of course, but how do you feel?”

“Ummm, light. Kind of like when you get home from school and dump your bag off.”

“That is good. Do you want to tell me about you?”

“Yeah, actually I really do. I love playing, I love my family and friends. I think my life is actually really great, I get to do art for work, and I get to eat good food. And music! Music makes me so happy. I also wish I could go to the beach more often, I love swimming.”

“Would you like to go to the beach after this?”

“That sounds great!”

“Now, please don’t hate me for this next question.”

“Yes…”

“Who are you?”

“WHAT?! What do you mean? Haven’t I stripped myself down to reveal my inner most self?”

“Yes of course you have, and I am very happy that you were able to do that! But now I want to know what constitutes you. Who is this being that you have uncovered?”

“Can I have a moment please?”

“You can have all the time in the world.”

“I don’t know for sure but this me seems, holy. Not in like a conventional sense of the word, but just like, beyond me. It’s always been with me, watching, learning, feeling. Or perhaps I have always been with it, me… us? Us. 
It’s as though everything I thought was me was just like clothes and accessories that I collected throughout life. It kept piling up and eventually obscured myself entirely. I never took the time to take off layers that were too small, worn out, or just didn’t suit me. 
I can see myself more clearly now. It’s pure, and light, and so loving. But… I don’t think it’s special. Like, obviously it is special, it’s ME. But special in a unique way. You asked what made me different from other people. Well at my core - nothing. 
I feel an overwhelming sense of connectedness. I am not me, I am you. And him, and her, and everyone. Everyone that ever was and ever will be - Hang on, who the heck are you?”

“Oh my gosh, thanks so much for asking! To be honest that’s a bit of a tricky question to answer. Oooh look, our food is on its way.”

“I’m not ready. I don’t want to forget this so soon.”

“I understand. If it makes you feel better, there will always be a part of you that remembers.”

“But, I want to go back to my life. I had so much that I wanted to do. There are so many people who I love.”

“I want you to know that your friends thought even more highly of you than you thought they did.”

“Will it hurt?”

“Yes.”

“Will it be worth it?”

“More so than you can possibly imagine! Are you ready, it’s almost here.”

“I am.”

“Enjoy!”

Winner | Loser  | Match Finish | Stipulation
---|---|----|----
Kelani Jordan | Blake Monroe | Count-Out after Blake flees in a car from Jordynne Grace during the match | 
Hank and Tank | Kale Dixon and Uriah Connors w/ Andre Chase | Honk Honk  | For the NXT Tag Team Championships
Myles Borne | Lexis King  | Borne Again | 
Stacks w/ Arianna Grace  | Yoshiki Inamura | Big Boot from Josh Briggs running in |
Sol Ruca w/ Zaria (c)  |  Tatum Paxley w/ The Culling | Sol Snatcher as Nia and Lash brawl at ringside causing a distraction  | For the Women's North American Championship

**IMPORTANT NOTES**


* Kale and Uriah ask Andre what their chances are tonight and he says honestly it's about one in a million but they take it as a sign that there is a chance and with Chace in their corner there's no way they can lose! 

* Following the tag title match Dark State appears and beat down both Hank and Tank and Kale and Uriah, laying out Tank with a toss powerbomb.

* Jacy Jayne tells Fatal Influence that last week didn't go as plan and they need to step it up especially with Ashe by Elegance coming for her Knock-Outs Championship. Ashe's consigere comes by and tries to polish the title since Ashe is taking it this Thursday. Jacy pulls away and tells him to get lost when Lainey Reed pops up and says that polishing the title is Fallon's job any way. Fatal Influence blow her off but Jacy says she's right and tells Fallon to go polish it.

* Backstage Izzy Dame tells Tatum that The Culling believes in her and if she pins Sol tonight she'll never have to worry about fitting in ever again because she will fit into the history books. Tatum says she's so excited

* Thea Hail is doing a video on social media of her getting coffee all the while complaining about Nia Jax saying she's the one who's bitter.

* Darkstate says Hank and Tank are always one step behind and says it wasn't The Culling who attacked them, it was them and they're going for those tag titles. However they aren't done yet.

* Nia Jax is interviewed after her match, she says any ring she steps into is her and says Lash isn't going to make a name off of her. She's been a champion, she's beaten legends, hall of famers, what has Lash done? Lash comes out and says even a force like Nia breaks under her pressure and rushes the ring and the two brawl. 

* Jordyne Grace tells Ava she knows she will be cleared and Ava says she knows so that means Grace will get her hands on Blake at Heatwave. Ava says she knows she's supposed to be unbias but she was disgusted by what Monroe did last week and hopes she gets her ass kicked.

* Oba Femi makes his way down to the ring, he says two weeks ago Yoshiki and Josh Briggs threw everything they had at him to try and take this title and they failed miserably. So now he stands here as champion for 200 days and the question is who is next to try and take this title from him. He says NXT is supposed to be about building the future but given the lack of credible challengers the future isn't looking very bright. Trick Williams interrupts and says he's the biggest dog in NXT. Oba asks if he's trying hard to convince the fans or is he trying to convince himself? Trick says he's the man carrying two brands on his back. Oba says let's talk about it like Trick says, if Trick is carrying two brands why is he the one carrying this NXT Championship? Is it because Trick knows the answer is the same it was a few months ago. Trick says he isn't the same man he was a few months ago, he is self made and he will be the one who knocks Oba off his mountain. Je'Von Williams comes out and says Trick is goofy as hell, he's here trying to go after Oba Femi while Trick is trying to make this all about himself and getting the NXT Championship when he can barely defend the TNA Championship. Trick tells Je'Von to mind himself when grown folks are talking. Oba says this is between him and Trick but Je'Von says he wants to face Trick and the winner faces Oba Femi for the NXT Championship. Oba likes the plan and Je'Von suggests they have it tonight but Trick says these people aren't getting to see him fight for free and this match is taking place in two weeks in a proper city like Philadelphia. Moose appears! He tells Trick it's time to get back to reality and remind him that in 10 days he's taking that TNA Championship from him. He also tells Oba he hasn't forgotten what happened last time they faced and is ready to go again. Darkstate go to attack all four of them but they all briefly align and send Darkstate packing to the outside.

* Backstage Wren Sinclair tells Charlie Dempsey at least they still have the Wren-CQT, Charlie asks what she means and says it stands for Wren-Charlie Quality Time! Charlie laments on training Myles and Tatum too well and how now they're gone. Wren says whenever she's down in the dumps she knows what cheers her up up and starts singing Joe Hendry's theme song. Charlie says that won't really work and then Joe comes out of a fridge behind them! Joe asks Charlie what has him so grumpy and Charlie says that Hendry only cares about being viral which is fitting because he is like a virus. Joe says he knows the only thing Charlie likes is wrestling so how about they have a match next week. He hands Charlie his own blue dress shirt and slacks but Charlie throws them down and walks away. Wren shows off her own blue top and slacks and gets a picture with Joe.

* Ethan Page says today marks 70 days of the reign of the greatest North American Champion of all time, standing a true example of Canadian excellence. Last week Santino and his reptile sock failed to beat him, but at least he was still a Canadian, just not the greatest North American of all time. He lists other great Canadians he is better than such as Alexander Grahm Bell, Wayne Gretzky, and even Bret Hart. Before he decides what content to devour next Ethan demands the crowd be silent as he sings the Canadian national anthem. He starts to sing when Tavion Heights comes out and says no one came here to listen to a Canadian goose dying. He can respect Ethan for representing his country, he did the same for the USA at the Olympics before, but Ethan is acting like he's standing on a perch and he's about ready to knock him off. Tavion says he just got out of NQCC and he needs to find a place for all this pent up energy he's got. Ethan tries to get him to back down when Chelsea Greene appears! She says how their Tavion interrupt the greatest Canadian to ever hold the North American Champion of all time, a man who inspires future Canucks. She says the greatest American heroes come from Canada and Ethan is the model Canadian, second only to her. She came out here to support her countryman and sing along with him until this rude American ruined everything. She says Tavion is cute when he's angry but even someone as trashy as him wouldn't have balls to hit a woman like her as Ethan hides behind Chelsea and the Her-vice. He strikes behind them and takes out Ethan and says he'll find a woman who will.

* Lola Vice congratulates Kelani on the victory earlier when Fatal Influence interrupts and Jacy mocks Kelani on winning by count out and asks if she wants a title shot next. Fallon comes back with the titles and Jacy says the two of them will never get their hands on either of these and says she'll have her sidekicks deal with them next week.

* Sol and Zaria are strategizing before the match later tonight when Lash and Nia brawl by, Ava steps between them and says they'll face off next week.

* Je'Von, Trick, Moose, and Oba are in Ava's office arguing about who will get their hands on Darkstate. Ava comes in and says Je'Von and Trick will face off in 2 weeks in a #1 contenders match but next week they'll all face Darkstate in an 8 man tag. Hank and Tank storm in and demand a match with Darkstate next week but Ava says the spot has already been taken but at Heatwave they'll face two members of Darkstate with the titles on the line.

* Ricky Saints is interviewed, he says he's had a target on his back since he came to NXT but all for different reasons. People like Ethan Page have 18 years of experience and will do anything to carve a name in NXT and leave his mark. Then you have Jasper Troy who is fresh and wants to make an impact right off the bat. Ethan says his goal is being NXT Champion but he's dealing with Jasper Troy first in two weeks in Philadelphia. He promises things won't end like they did before and warns Jasper to be ready.

For example, our morning routine used to be rigid: 7 AM, lights on, coffee maker starts, news plays. But my partner works nights sometimes, so waking them up with that felt harsh. Now, I set up a “soft start” option. If their phone’s alarm is off (meaning they’re sleeping), the lights fade in over 15 minutes instead of popping on, and the coffee waits until 8 AM. 

Another thing: I programmed our smart display to show family photos when it’s not in use. It’s a tiny thing, but walking by and seeing a picture of my niece’s birthday makes the “tech” feel like part of the family, not just a gadget. 

Do you have little tweaks that make your smart home feel less like a machine and more like it’s “paying attention” to \*you\*?

Part 3,"I’ve been MIA for a week since my account got banned. So this is the part 3 of the story about me and my boss. In Part 2, maybe some people got annoyed. Hehe. So, yeah… he blocked me on all social media platforms. I transferred to another company to work and try to fix myself, to set things right. From 2019 to 2020, we had zero communication. I even had a boyfriend and eventually got engaged. I remember on December 11, 2020, I noticed someone followed and added me on IG and Facebook. I was shocked it was him, my boss. The moment I saw his name, everything came rushing back. All the memories both good and bad. I wasn’t sure whether I should accept or not. I waited a whole week before I finally followed back and accepted his request. After that, I noticed he started liking my photos, even the ones with my boyfriend. But surprisingly, he never messaged me. Just liked my posts and reacted with hearts whenever I posted a story or something on my feed. Fast forward to 2023 I was already married to my fiancé, for almost 2 years and we had a daughter. I was living my best and happiest life… until he suddenly messaged me: “How are you?” I didn’t know what to do. Should I reply? Ignore him? Block him the way he blocked me before? But I figured the past is the past so I replied casually. He told me he was happy for me, said my daughter was cute and looked just like me. And little by little, over days, weeks, and months, we started talking again. He apologized for blocking me back then. I told him, ""It’s okay. Maybe if you hadn’t done that, I wouldn't have met my husband now."" But then… he started acting different again. He asked me out for coffee. And me, being stupid, I agreed. I remember it was August 27, 2023. We met up and boom! The moment I got in the car, we made out. We kissed for a long time before we even made it to the coffee shop. I missed him and apparently, he missed me too. I suddenly remembered the first time he kissed me back in 2017. So yeah, we eventually got to the coffee shop and chatted like nothing had changed. It felt like old times. And then it happened again. I started telling my husband I had meetings at the office because I worked from home but really, I was going to the city once a month just to meet my former boss for lunch or dinner. Then on October 17, 2024 it happened again. We got a hotel room. As soon as the door closed, we started kissing passionately. He grabbed my breasts and licked them. He went down on me hard. I honestly missed the way he licked my kitty. Then I gave him head. His big dick I sucked it. We did our favorite position: 69. I was so horny I told him to just put it in me again, without a condom. I rode him. He said I felt so good, so warm. And when he didn’t want to cum yet, he went down on me again until I climaxed. Then he slid it back in and fucked me hard. He squeezed my tits and played with my nipples. I even licked his nipples he gets turned on by that. And then he came inside me. We kept meeting after that. We kept having sex. I know it’s wrong. I have a husband and a child. But I just couldn’t resist him. Oh, and by the way he’s a widower now. His wife passed away from cancer. That’s probably why he came back and started messing with me again. So… that’s it for now… 😋",0,1754445214.0,confessions,0,0.4,False

**DOT Sec. Duffy**:  [Talking about public safety given drone use is for commercial purposes, including for delivering Amazon packages and even a cup of Starbucks coffee]

>""...It's going to ***require*** collision avoidance technology.""

An observation worth making is that the potential uses for lidar in massively expanded drone use are not limited to collision avoidance or navigation by terrain with or without remote control.  Rather, several of the justifying applications, for example, inspection of bridges, powerlines, and other infrastructure for damage, etc. using drones, not only make dangerous or inaccessible places safely accessible, they also require technology to conduct the inspection itself once the drone safely arrives.  Undoubtedly, cameras will be part of this, but lidar can see things that cameras cannot in certain environments, and does so in 3D.  The same lidar that allows the drone to navigate at speed through obstacles safely to its vantage point can conduct the inspection itself.

48:20+

**Duffy** explicitly identifies the risk of domestic use of drone technology provided by adversaries:

>""...It's very dangerous to deploy someone else's commercial technology into our airspace, and ***the data that could be gleaned*** from that is a ***national security threat***, and so we **want this to be American technology**, American innovation...

Responding to concerns that drones could be a nuisance, Duffy points out that delivery drones will have the effect of reducing vehicle congestion on the roadway and associated fuel use.

So I’ve decided to formula feed from day 1! 

Question for the experts. My hospital gives the little ready to feed Enfamil bottles. How do I transition the baby to bottles at home? I want to try Mam and another brand, but if the nipple is different from the hospital bottle, will it matter? 

Also this was my game plan: baby formula kettle that keeps water warm and can boil it, since we are well water. But is a bottle warmer better?

So I was up and had 2 coffee, did a few things and slept for 3 hours. It merged everything and made my sleep score that was only crappy due to lack of sleep and lower HRV and merged it with 3 hours awake and a 3 hour nap. So my sleep looked horrible. If I edit the sleep it doesn't boost my score like it would with an auto detect nap that I had to confirm. 

Am I doing something wrong with it not asking me to confirm anymore? I would like to be able to manually add a nap, especially if it is going to keep merging after a few hours of being up in the morning. ",1,1754444793.0,ouraring,0,1.0,False
1mirxlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/sepsis/comments/1mirxlx/is_it_possible_i_have_should_i_go_to_er/,Is It Possible I have? Should I Go To ER?,"Hi,

I went to the dermatologist last week because Earlier last month, I developed this enormous Cyst on my back. It was very red and painful and definitely looked and felt infected. When I saw the derm, I guess she agreed because she prescribed doxycycline and a topical antibiotic cream. 

It’s been about 10 days and this is very confusing because I have chronic conditions that could be causing or worsening some of these symptoms but it seems like a couple of days before the derm visit where she drained it, I started getting new ones like I felt a little mental confusion the night before my appt. It was like all of a sudden I was laying in bed and it hit me. It happened the day of the appt as well and has been happening ever since. I also have a chronic condition that causes brain fog and if I have a histamine reaction , it can cause the same symptom (MCAD). But now, I’m having even more symptoms like worsening cervical and other spine pain (I have a number of spinal cord conditions that cause constant chronic pain but it seems worse in the last few days. The one that is really scaring me at the moment tho is very severe fatigue and weakness. I feel dehydrated almost. All day my mouth has been very dry and I am falling asleep if I sit or lay down. It’s overwhelming exhaustion. Again, I have chronic fatigue syndrome and Lyme disease but I know more normal fatigue and this feels A LOT extra. I am too exhausted to even shower or take out my garbage, etc.

I’ve been on the doxy for a week. Would that automatically kill the sepsis? They did a test on the stuff inside the cyst and they didn’t say it came back with sepsis. Would it have shown? Could the fatigue be from the doxy? I’ve also been having more GERD symptoms. Lots of acid in there esp waking up with it and all day long etc. I’m a very regular coffee drinker and the last few days, I haven’t even been wanting it because the acid is so bad as it is.

I’m getting scared. I’m feeling overwhelming fatigue. My sleep is normally poor and disturbed because I suffer from severe chronic pain but again, this is more than usual. It took me hours to get up to throw dinner in the microwave because I was so fatigued I kept laying down and I kept falling asleep.

It’s almost 10:00pm. Should I wait and call the dermatologist tomorrow and ask what to do or if it’s even possible this is sepsis since I’ve already been on antibiotics for a week? Should I go to the ER now and tell them what’s going on? I would rather not do that if I can wait but I’m afraid if it is sepsis or something else than it sounds like waiting is not a good idea.  

Really concerned. What should I do? I can always go to bed tonight and try to get as much rest as possible and see if this is better tomorrow?

Also, I’m reading there’s usually a fever and chills. Is that always the case or is severe fatigue and malaise and pain enough for me to be concerned?

Thank you. ",0,1754444771.0,sepsis,3,0.5,False

We talk quite a bit every day and things are decently flirty as well so I know there's some interest there. I'm not usually one to get antsy about meeting someone in person but I really like this guy from what I've come to know about him so far, and I think given the chance it could work out. He genuinely seems interest in me as well, hence why I'm a bit confused as to what's going on.

I've asked him two different times if he wants to meet up for something easy like lunch or coffee, but both times I was kind of shrugged off. The first time I asked him he said he wasn't busy at first, but then said he had too many plans and couldn't make it happen. The second time I asked him he said he was super busy, but then didn't actually seem to have anything going on. Also, when I brought it up the second time he said that he really wanted to meet me as well but that it was not going to work with his schedule. I understand that I am nowhere near a priority for this guy, as we have really just met, but I am a bit confused as to what to do next.

If anyone has advice or has experience something similar, I'm all ears. I'm not sure if it's appropriate to keep asking him if he wants to meet up, or to just drop it. I don't want to be dragged along for months before I can ever actually meet this guy, but I also don't want to seem overbearing/overinterested. However, I'm also nervous to let it go too soon because I have a really hard time meeting guys in general, and I want to see if this will work even if it takes some time.",1,1754444749.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I Tried the Viral App Testing Gig—Here’s the CRAZY Truth! 🤯💸,"OK... So you’re telling me people are seriously GETTING PAID to click CAPTCHAS?

Wait. WHAT!?

I’ve spent the last, I dunno, 5 years swearing at those picture puzzles every time I just want to log in somewhere. “Select all the traffic lights” or “Find every bus.” Ugh. Little did I know, some people are literally flipping that annoying experience into cold, hard cash. 

Am I missing something? Are captchas the new crypto? LOL.

I mean, I heard people could get paid for watching ads, and there’s always been those “survey for cents” sites (which I actually tried and made 2 bucks from in about 6 hours…so not exactly worth it), but CLICKING CAPTCHA???? Is this for real? Naturally, I had to investigate — and what I found is honestly kind of wild. Here’s the truth about these so-called App Testing Gateways.

**Here’s How These Apps Pitch It:**
- ""Sign up and get paid to test apps, click captchas, and rate interfaces!""
- It sounds INCREDIBLE for anyone who wants pocket change on the bus or while bored at work.
- They dangle $5, $10, even $20 payout thresholds to hook you in.

I stumbled across **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**—crazy easy to register, all emoji fireworks and $$$ signs everywhere.

**But...Here Comes the Reality Check.**

- Most of these “tasks” are literally endless walls of captchas—like, “find the hydrant” thirty times until you’re seeing street signs when you close your eyes.
- They pay out in tiny increments (we’re talking like $0.01 per solved puzzle).
- When you finally earn enough to cash out, suddenly: “Please complete one final app test.” Great...except that “final test” is more surveys, downloads, or “invite friends” tasks.
- And don’t even get me started on having to REPEAT tasks if you “fail” a captcha.

BUT, some people actually reported getting SMALL payouts — like, not enough for rent but hey, coffee money counts for something, right?

**What’s the Actual Play Here?**

- Some gateways like **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** seem more legit than the obvious scammy popups you get on shady sites.
- They’re leveraging YOUR effort to help AI learn or fill some data need, but at a MINIMAL wage.
- The payout takes AGES unless you have the focus of an eagle and friends willing to sign up with your code.
- Your data is harvested — which is, honestly, the real currency here.

**So Should You Try It?**

- If you like easy, mindless tasks and don’t mind your fingers numbing for a handful of dollars, **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** could give you a look at this weird digital hustle.
- Don’t expect hundreds of dollars, but maybe enough to cover Netflix for a month (if you’re SUPER persistent).

**Final Thoughts...I’M SHOCKED.**

People really out here clicking boxes and calling it “app testing” for micro-earnings. Is it a genius hustle or just modern serfdom in tech clothing? I honestly don’t even know what to believe anymore!

If you’re DYING to see if it’s your new guilty pleasure, here’s the link again — **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** — not a scam (at least for testing), but 100% one for the “WTF did I just do with my time” experience.

But hey, now every time I see “Please confirm you’re not a robot,” I’ll wonder whose coffee I accidentally financed...

Has anyone here ever had a big payout from **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** or any other gateway?

While I was working he went to the kitchen and came back a few minutes later with a cup of coffee for me.

He hates coffee.

He bought coffee the day before, after our talk, and also bought a little moka pot and made me a cup of coffee. His first coffee ever was for me.

I, of course, didn't know he didn't like coffee at all, nor that he bought all that stuff just for me. But when he casually told me that after a month going to his apartment to work I immediately knew I wanted to marry him. 

By that time we didn't even kissed. Nothing.

He and his (a little burnt) coffee were enough.

For espresso drinks we like Shen Joe's Old World and Dark Horse, along with Mud House and Happ. Marie Bettes flavor is too strong for us.

Curious for your opinions on this offering coffee from Trader Joe's. Am not currently grinding beans for my moka pot, except maybe on weekends when there's leisure time for it, so factory ground is definitely attractive as it gets me out the door in the morning.
