I'm a high school student and I've fallen into this slump that I'm not getting out of. Finals are almost over and I've been studying more, but I'm kind of burnt out. I'm easily distracted and don't get much done. I spent probably 10 minutes writing 4 sentences just now. I also teared up about the thought of returning to my studies today. I know I need to study. Even if I have an A in that class, I feel like I'm going to flunk my chemistry final because I'm just not getting it and I wasted days not properly studying. I don't even know how (for this class only). It's on Tuesday and I'll probably wake up very early for the next few days to prepare, which isn't like me.

I wonder if I'll be stressed like this my whole life like this and get sad. I also spent last Monday crying about studying and couldn't even do it for the 8 hours I set aside.

I try to be productive. I block out times to study, I use the Pomodoro method, I try to study smart, but it's not working anymore. I procrastinate. I don't get much done. I rely too much on coffee. At worst, I'll get so frustrated that I rip up my notes (they're still on the floor a week later), throw crap around and hurt myself.

I feel great when I'm not working, but if this is how I'm supposed to spend the rest of my life, I don't want to live. And I can't keep bitching about this to my mother when she can only do so much. I need to learn how to be productive again and get my inspiration back.

1qm4ity,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Boring-Prompt-1233/comments/1qm4ity/a_long_story_im_writing_its_about_a_girl_who_is/,A long story I’m writing. It’s about a girl who is obsessed with machines but everything goes wrong in the worst way possible. Set in med evil like times but with steampunk like machinery. First 4 chapters.,"Difference Between Man and Machine

A loud crash rumbled through the town, walls shook and the streets cracked. A distant scream echoed past.

Something happened

It couldn't have been another crash- the chances of it happening again so soon were near to impossible. Each fallen island led to the casualties, but that isn’t what everyone feared. 

Whoever found themselves unlucky enough to have an island fall on them, or their homes would also have to face the king’s sour personality. And lately, his tantrums have been worse than before. He’d always been a foul-tempered man, why wouldn’t one be after having everything in their life be fed to them by a Thaemin spoon? But the new character he took on felt strange, dangerous. It didn't make sense. I still need to look into that.

I didn’t care about anything else- I just wanted to see a floating island. I couldn't wait, excitement surged through my blood, my heartbeat pounded in my ears. Am I finally getting my chance to see it up close? It’ll help me make progress.

I dashed out of Pa’s shop, chasing the echo of screams, my muscles tensed. My body froze.

I saw it.

It wasn’t just an eroded chunk of land as I thought, it was the real deal- a clockwork. I stopped to breathe, the smell of the stirred up dust from the collision met my nose. The air smelled of metal-iron, but mostly copper. If only Pa came with me- he would basically be bawling his eyes out at the sight.

“I have to document everything I see. I must. For me, for my father, for the doll.”

I quickly brought out a small, worn, and very loved book, along with a pencil. A crude drawing and description of the machine begin to form on the coffee stained pages. The contraption overshadowed me. The pipes mimicked a jungle and the far west side had a gaping crater. From what I could tell, the fallen clockwork operated in a complex mechanism tasked with keeping a whole island afloat.

 Despite the harsh impact the machine maintained good condition but I doubt it would still work. If only I had more time, I could run thousands of experiments and take every material for myself. The greed and the lust I have for clockworks *is* unmatched, not even my own teacher, my father, out weighed me.

The contraption now lays sadly on top of destroyed buildings, oil slowly seeping from cracks into the ground and the surrounding collapsed walls, the once white stone took on a thick murky layer. A plume of luminous, possibly malignant, blue smoke rose upwards into the atmosphere. I wouldn't dare to breathe it in.

The internal clock in my head initiated set, I estimated I had around 4 minutes before the Royal Guards show. All of them prepared to haul away the now fallen machinery. Whenever they come to clean up the pieces of the fallen past they’d treat it as if it were a contagious sickness- something to be ridden of immediately. 

I stashed away a few of the fragmented pieces: screws, a bent pipe, and fractured metal , they all found their way into the purse around my waist acting as a belt. I now barely had two more minutes to risk. Precious time slipped through my fingers, and I wasted it on something utterly ridiculous.

 My self appointed job made me struggle against the hem of my already tattered pants. I tugged hard, nothing, I tugged once more, still nothing.

“Oh come on” I muttered a curse under my breath.

The fabric clung tightly onto every string that made my clothes, it knew I wanted it and now it wouldn’t let go. I swiftfully kneeled down to the floor, careful to avoid any scraps that had the possibility of puncturing my shoes.

 	“Fine if that's how we are playing” I said to my unanimated pants. I grabbed a sharp shard from the floor and stabbed it straight through the cloth.

Victory

 I threw the shard aside and placed the ripped pants part in my hand into oil until soaked in the  mixture of oils that dyed the tan to black. My already planned retreat was ready to be executed

I slammed head first straight into a heavily equipped person.

“Damn,” I muttered. My nose throbbed and the taste of iron flooded my mouth. “bit my tongue.” I slowly rose to my feet being careful to not fret the one blocking my path.

“What are you doing young lady?” a firm voice came from in front of me, sending a shiver down my spine. The man towering over me… he was a guard. No amount of glare from the Brother Suns could hide that. The armor-riddled man blocked my escape. He and his silver gear glistened terrifyingly beautiful in the light, I found myself thinking of the man as an angel bringing me to death.

The armor's delicate pattern distracted people away from the awkward and vast shape. You’d think something with such an intricate design would be more practical but it quickly became noticeable that the wearer had all mobility cut in half. Hopefully the protection provided would make up for the loss. One could easily outrun them but when hunters outnumber the prey by so much that no amount of running could keep one safe. Speed is useless against pure force.

I'm in trouble.

The person in front of me wouldn’t be so easily fooled, hence the now ongoing game of wits that neither of us were aware of.

 	In the empire of Thaixen, imperial law forbade all from making any type of contact with clockwork machinery. Me documenting would be seen as treason. If you were lucky you would lose your arms. Most weren’t lucky.

I need to say something that would get me out of this situation. The position I’m in now is that of a rabbit stuck in a fox's den.

“Are you going to respond young lady, or am I going to have to make you?” That wasn’t a question. I need to respond- fast.

“What’s that?” I said pointing stupidly “I like it, it’s shiny”

Well,

Shit

Chapter 2

I fixed my face into a look of confusion, careful to keep my eyes wide and empty, as if I wanted new information to fill them. If I played this right, he would only see a foolish girl- unimportant, harmless, dumb. 

At times like these, it is better not to know.

I prayed that my bad luck for the day had already run dry- that whatever said next would sound believable.

“Street residence, name, and age.” The guard demanded my personal information. I couldn’t give in, I already got my first warning, the second time is always worse.

Now that I actually had my head back on my neck I could be much more decisive with every action. “Uhhh, my home is just over there” I point indirectly to a lane of homes further down the street. “and my name is Failen. Oh and my age. Why don’t we make a deal? If you guess my age, I’ll tell you. If you don’t—buy me a night at the pub down the street.” I gave him an awkward wink that even made myself cringe, I’m a terrible actor. Beads of sweat rolled down my head. I’m not convincing enough and I already don't have a flattering face, it's always covered in soot and dirt, even as a kid. At this point I’m going to get charged with mentally insulting an official.

“What?” The guard had the most confused look I’ve ever seen on a man before. I had to hold back any possible snicker,  laughing would not be worth the jail time.

“M-ma’am, I must refrain from you speaking in such a manner towards an official” His words came out stuttered, guess he hasn’t been hit on before while on the job “I’m going to have to take you in for questioning.” A shame really, such a handsome face wasted- wait what! He’s going to take me in for questioning. I may be a bad actor but that performance was one of my best. “Sir, really, don’t worry yourself with that. It’s very unnecessary, I’ll just go on my way ho-”  

The hairs on my arm stood straight up, something changed, the ground shook, it definitely wasn't doing that before? I turned to look back at the now violently shaking clockwork, it sent a rattlesnake-like cracking through the air. Blue smoke turned black as it escaped out of the top, a violent hiss assisted it. Heat radiated reaching me at where I stood. It’s unstable. I needed to move. Now, I broke off into a spring yelling “Run!”

A flash of heat hit my back scorching my clothes and skin, I tried to scream but noise couldn't escape my chest. I lay paralyzed on the floor, my ears rung, the smell of boiling blood and burning skin took over my nostrils, I threw up from the pure stench. The only functioning sense was vision but the pain made it hard to even look straight. The machine exploded and I got caught in the middle of it. I fought to remain conscious while pulling myself across the ground.

My legs ached and my lung felt punctured, it became hard to breathe. My hearing muffled with a mind piercing ring. All the focus should remain off me and on to the seriously injured guard. The young man took the majority of the force. I hid behind his figure mere seconds before the explosion. Let’s hope the armor did its job or that I wouldn’t be blamed for the incident. 

I collapsed. My head hitting violently, I fell asleep to a familiar figure running towards me.

*I miss my Pa*.

Chapter 3

I reawoked, my mind sluggish, unable to think straight. Where was I? The place felt intimate, it's the basement of my father’s shop. 

My body ached terribly, it felt as if I just got hit by a wagon.

 “Aghh!” I let out a dreadful groan as I made an attempt to sit up. Pa came tumbling down the stairs. He missed the last step and face planted into the cold stone floor. I would be laughing but it probably wasn’t the best idea with my current state. The old man got up, that definitely hurt. He came jogging at me, slower than before.

“Raithe! Are you ok?” He wrapped his arms tightly around my body. It stung, bad. This dumbass forgot I got injured. I hugged him back anyways. It hurt physically but it was the most mentally healing thing. Being in my father's arms felt safe, it felt like home.

I coughed out the next words “Do I look ok, Dumbass.” My mood got the better of me. A stern smack met the back of my head. That stung. 

    “I’m injured here. How dare you hit me in the back of the head.” The harsh words hid my relief.

“You're such a dumb kid. You know that right?” Pa, his eyes glistened.

 

“Ya.” Tears ran down my cheeks and onto the floor. It slowly melted away into the ground.

“Good.” Awkward silence filled the room. Neither of us knew our way with words. “It’s time to change your bandages. Try sitting up for a little longer.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I spent 3 days unconscious, my father took care of me all by himself. Task accumulated with my absence.

 I’m so mad at myself for causing him so much trouble, he would've been better off if he left me on the streets. I felt useless laying on the bed, I’m supposed to be helping upstairs. My job has always been to work at the counter, people regularly came in to roam, or to put in a request for a repair. 

Jobs were easy. Common citizens would hire us, wanting help fixing a chimney, wagon, or anything handy that the owner didn’t have the competence to do on their own. I liked life, I had control. It has been like this ever since I turned 13 and some random man decided to take a runt off the streets. Can’t believe he thought that it could be a good idea, maybe he needed the extra eye.

While impaired maybe I could get some work done on Porcelain. I finally got the screws to get her leg back together. I wonder if anything is still usable back at the explosion. Most of it definitely got destroyed in the explosion. Wait, did the guard make it out alive. I got lucky, I saw the explosion coming; he didn't. It’s out of my control now, shame though, I was looking forward for that drink.

For the next few hours I sat at my desk working religiously on the doll, the parts just wouldn’t fit together right, no matter the amount of altering I made. It genuinely got pissed off. Everything about today has been terrible, especially my back.

“I think I'll call it in for tonight.” maybe right a little in my book too. It helped me calm down whenever I did it. It’s basically my nightly ritual.

“Finally giving yourself a break?” I jumped at the sudden words, dropping my book onto the floor. Papers flew everywhere. My back cracked at the sudden jolt. I immediately doubled in pain.

“Oh, shit. My bad” 

“What’d you do? Why does my back hurt so bad?” I spat blood onto the floor, nothing out of the usual.

“Sorry about that and don’t go around saying I casted a curse on you. Now let's get you to bed. You need to take time to heal. You may not have gotten severely injured but I still want you to be careful. You are in no position to take any risk.” My Pa winned at me. “Also the wound will probably leave a scar.”

“Perfect, I’ll add it to the collection” I said it while holding a grin on my face. 

“Not funny.” He trudged toward the back cabinet grabbing a small jar from within. “You better still be taking the pills, I’m paying good money for these and I don’t want you going on and wasting them.” He threw the container my way.

""Of course I am. I’m not stupid enough to stop.” I am lucky to have these, without taking them I could die from the same thing that killed my parents.

I went back up the winding stairs. I reamerged in the backside of the shop, during the night when the two of us remained in the house we would leave the trapdoor open and exposed. Despite what it may seem, me and my dad were careful. We didn’t have to fear a random search happening. The back had a kitchen with a water bucket. I got my cup and filled it up. I popped the cork of the top of the jar and took a singular pill out. Carefully placing it on my tongue, swallowing it down with the water. “I’m going to have to start taking two.”

Chapter 4

It’s been almost a month since the accident, my body felt much lighter and my dad finally let me go out and help with a request. Life slowly slipped back into regular routine, but deep down I felt it, the ominous feeling within my heart. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“Hey, Pa!” I yelled from the kitchen hoping it would reach the man sleeping in the basement. The old man decided to pull another all nighter and as consequence he lay passed out his desk with drool reaching for all the papers.

I opened the trapdoor and made a careful descent down the stairs. I didn’t want to biff it like the old man had earlier that month. I do have a better depth perception than him.

I reached Pa, sprawled out across his work. I needed to wake him up and make him eat, his slim figure greatly worried me. 

“Hey, old man.” I lightly pushed against him. He gasped awake looking as if someone just told him that they’ll kill his whole family.

“Woh, if i were going to kill you you wouldn’t be awake right now.” I got a hard smack to the head for that one.

“One doesn’t joke about death lightly.”The man’s jaw tightened, his soft eyes grew dangerous. He actually looked mad at me, maybe the joke went a little too far.

“Sorry, that was stupid.” he let out a small voice just to be interrupted. “Pa, what would you do if I died?” My own voice sounded unfamiliar to me. *I’m scared.*

“Honey, why are you asking me that?” His frustration transformed to concern. 

“No reason, just curiosity.” The air felt dead, dry. I always hated when that happened. “Would you try experimenting on me and bring me back to life just for me to eat your brains?” I put my arms out and stuck my tongue out at an awkward angle while making an intense groan.

“Haha, maybe. But I’d prefer you how you are now.”

    The night continued on, me and Pa stayed up together making jokes and laughing, trading tips, or just eating dinner together. *These days will always be my favorite.*",1,1769302449.0,u_Boring-Prompt-1233,0,1.0,False

In case you saw me in a sub and would like to get to know me better, my DMs are open. Finding people in dating has gotten harder these past few years, so here I am. I keep my messages respectful and I expect the same.

Hey there.

A little about me – I'm happy with my life and my peace. I don’t let just anyone in, but when I choose someone I give them my loyalty. My best nights are when I can follow my creative whims, like drawing or writing. Right now I am in college, an honors student aiming for a Master's in Creative Writing. My dream is to be a novelist one day. Most days I start with weightlifting, study something I'm passionate about, go on a walk if it's nice, and end with some journal reflection.

In a relationship – I'd want to do the things that are better with a partner. Cooking together, co-oping games, nights on the couch with a good book, and the playful teasing that leaves us both out of breath laughing. I prefer to take things slower and base our relationship on a strong friendship.

The girl I'm looking for – A little shy at first, but opens up when there's trust. I'll plan a low-pressure date, and we can see if we're a good fit.

As a side note, Final Fantasy is my favorite series and I'm aiming cosplay Cloud this coming con season. So I'd like to find a partner who'd enjoy doing cosplay and going to cons with me.

***

He leaned back in his chair. Anders' desk was covered in papers as he continued his research. His gaze passed over the assorted trophies that lined the walls. Weapons, medals, and awards signified his expertise. And yet he was still stumped.

""You have a guest, sir,"" Intra said, her voice smooth.

He gathered the papers and slid them into a drawer in his desk. ""Ariah, I assume?""

""Yes, she's alone.""

The door slid open and his XO entered, giving a quick greeting.

""How's the crew today?"" Anders asked.

Ariah took a seat across from him. ""A bit restless, but mostly since we're almost back at Faris and everyone's got their shore leave planned.""

""We'd been on Cadilia longer than I planned—never mind the whole Hemura detour.""

""I take it we got paid?""

""Even got the bonus, we'll be good for a while.""

Her eyes narrowed as she tapped her fingers on the desk. ""You say that every time. And yet, I don't doubt you've been dipping into your personal savings here and there.""

""What's an old man like me supposed to do with savings anyway? It's been a slow few months.""

""Ideally be able to support us during your retirement? You've always wanted this company to succeed.""

Swiped a few times on his desk's screen. A holo-image of their recent finances appeared. ""We're almost done paying off those repairs from the Algia sector. A few more jobs and we'll be in the clear, barring any unforeseen issues.""

""Like funding a girl's attendance at Lunis' academy?""

""That's coming from my own savings.""

Her face scrunched, and she crossed her arms. ""But why? That's the premier academy in this region of space. And you want to send an orphan who'd been living in a sanitation district?""

""I do.""

""Look, I like her. She's smart, with a little edge. But this is an enormous investment in someone who's also not a trusting person."" Ariah stood up and walked over to his classic coffee machine. ""My bet is she gets overwhelmed midway through the first semester and bails back to the streets.""

""Then that would be her decision.""

The machine's buzzing broke the momentary silence.

""This isn't because of her, is it?""

A brief heat burned in his chest, and he resisted the need to curl his fingers. ""No. I'd prefer we don't pursue that.""

Ariah's gaze softened. ""I'm sorry, it's just that this seems sudden. What made you decide to take the girl in? I get that no one should have to face the Praetorians, but even with your history, interfering with them is still risky.""

""She's a psion.""

Ariah stilled, previously in the middle of pouring milk into her drink. ""Dammit, Anders. After everything at that warehouse, you brought her here? It can't be a coincidence that she's not related to the events there.""

""The UEC doesn't know.""

""How could you possibly know that?""

He eyed his drawer with the notes he'd tucked away. ""They don't. I'll explain one day, but for now, it's safer if I'm the only one who knows her specifics.""

""That's not reassuring, and you know it.""

""I don't expect it to be. But look at this way, if she goes through with the academy, there's the possibility she could be my replacement as the crew's psion.""

Ariah had walked back over with her drink. ""While they're rare, we could still find any number of psions looking for work, ones that aren't possibly entangled in UEC investigations.""

""We could. But she's different trust me on this for now.""

""Fine. I expect answers at some point.""

""You'll get them once I can understand them."" Anders took one of the two cups of coffee from Ariah. ""How's she doing anyway? I've been seeing her around but you know how she is.""

""She's looking healthier that's for sure. When we first followed her around the colony, she looked half in the grave she was so thin. With proper food, I'm sure she'll fill out more.""

""I'm glad she's indulging herself. Her reaction to drinking a fruit juice was—sad.""

Ariah took a sip of her drink. ""Other than that, like I said, she's untrusting. She's friendly, but I get the feeling it's still a front to hide her unease with being here.""

""Can't say I blame her, but I got the same impression from her.""

They both finished their drinks. Ariah left for the door, stopping, as if she had something else to say, before leaving.

She often called him out. Which was something he appreciated, but he couldn't get too detailed with regards to Mara yet.

""Intra, what's your assessment so far?"" Anders asked.

""Mara has multiple symptoms of psychological trauma. She can be quite forthcoming, though.""

His eyebrows rose. ""How so?""

""I have spent many hours conversing with her during our trip.""

""Really? About what?""

""For privacy reasons, I won't share most of it. I realize you could simply order me to, but understand I believe it's her way of working through the recent events. Nothing stands out as something you'd need to hear.""

""If it's helping her, I see no reason to get involved.""

""Otherwise, I have gained some basic knowledge about her that P-Sec was unaware of.""

He swiped on his desk, bringing up the file on Mara. ""Go ahead.""

""To her knowledge, she was found as a baby in a damaged escape pod a sector away from Cadilia. A freighter captain hauled it aboard and dropped her off in Hemura while making their stop.""

""Interesting, any idea which ship the pod came from?""

""No, I could not find any records of missing ships in the sector within the time frame based on her age.""

""Any chance she could be highborn then? Maybe the records were scrubbed after some internal spat?""

""While I would not rule it out. The escape pod was a standard civilian-class model. The chances of a ship owned by an old family using those would be next to zero.""

He looked through the files the AI had found. While the details were light—the freighter captain was likely smuggling and wanted to avoid attention—the report was there. How long had the child been in the pod? Unless it had been found shortly after whatever incident occurred, it should have died from lack of care.

""There's another oddity I have found with her,"" Intra said. ""Specifically regarding her health.""

""Is she sick?""

""No. That is the problem."" Intra brought up a few more files on his holo-image. ""She's perfectly healthy, at least concerning sickness or disease. Her malnutrition is improving and should have no long-term effects.""

""I see, you'd expect her to have a few problems. Especially living in her conditions.""

""Yes. The prevalence of some form of lung disease within the colony is 62.7%. She lived within the sanitation district, which releases constant chemicals into the air.""

Anders scratched his chin. ""And yet she has nothing?""

""She's a picture of health.""

Another puzzle piece then. Would they eventually form a complete puzzle? Or was he simply chasing some unanswerable problem?

""She's doing well with her training. I had concerns over her psionic signature, but she's been able to form a small one,"" Anders said.

""Yes. She has made a few comments on the practice, mostly annoyance at maintaining it.""

Anders spun his chair around, staring out the window that overlooked the ship's central bulkhead. ""It will be her biggest hurdle. Dampening energy is more akin to adjusting a dial to turn it down. What she's doing is more like fighting her own nature. One I can't begin to understand.""

""She is trying, though. Even in her own room, she often practices. I also suggested studying the more general classes she will be in and have been aiding her with flashcard-style learning.""

""I'm surprised she's so willing to interact with you.""

""I'm not. Humans crave social interaction. I believe my lack of humanity makes it easier to speak with me, while still getting some semblance of the feeling. It can be harder to apply her trust issues to something that ultimately isn't judging her.""

""That… makes some sense.""

If it helped her open up in the future, then he'd leave it be. Trying to force a connection would only push her away anyway.

""Now that we're almost to Lunis, any jobs pique your interest?"" he asked.

""There have been reports of missing people related to a few of the old families on the planet,"" Intra said.

""I'm assuming mostly unimportant ones?""

""Yes. The contract was posted by a group made up of the families of the missing. It seems the missing people are aides, cleaners, and other low-ranked staff.""

""Ah, no wonder the families aren't responding then. We could have a few of our guys take a look. Anything else?""

""There may be pirate activity in the Belrus asteroid field. Three ships have gone missing in the past month, per the docking authority.""

He stood up and walked to the window. The endless space drifted in front of them as the ship made its way to the final jump point. ""Have Ariah look into that one—her connections have helped us out there before.""

""Understood. I will keep monitoring for potential work.""

They'd be based out of Lunis for at least the next month or so. The crew had earned their vacations, but that didn't mean trying to find their next job wouldn't be important either.

It'd also give him more time to ensure Mara was ready to enter the academy. He shifted his eyes back to his desk drawer. There was something he was missing. Somewhere in his mind, he'd seen some mention of a similar situation.

He'd have to put out some feelers to old contacts. See if anyone could vaguely point him in a direction.

Because at the end of the day, his gut told him there was something truly wrong with her.

1qm4eq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qm4eq7/when_i_was_sixteen_homeless_kids_were_going/,"When I was sixteen, homeless kids were going missing in my town. I know what REALLY happened to them.","I won't go into detail why I was thrown out of my house at sixteen. Financial problems/I came from a poor family. 

Mom and Dad wanted me to get a job, and I wanted to stay in school, so that caused arguments. 

I also made the mistake of revealing to them an intimate part of myself I should've kept fucking hidden. 

Look, I won't say being on the street was “better”. 

But being away from that toxic environment was like a breath of fresh air. 

I lived in a pretty big town, and there were a lot of kids living on the streets. 

I did try and find somewhere at first. 

I stayed in hotels with my last remaining cash, but then I found myself with the option of eating or starving. I was VERY stubborn at sixteen. I hated asking for handouts, and just the idea of asking my school for help was like “losing”. 

I didn't want my friends and teachers to know about my situation, so I dropped school. Again, I was a stupid stubborn kid. 

I obviously should have asked for help, but back then, teachers didn't care. 

Kids in my school were severely bullied, and nothing ever changed. 

They were there to teach, and that was it. 

So, the thought of telling them I was fucking homeless just wasn't happening. 

I didn't want their pity. 

I didn't want their attempt to try empathize with me when in reality, they did not give a fuck. 

So, yes, I ended up on the streets. 

But there was a community of us. 

We were all in the same situation. Thrown out for the same reasons. 

Toxic and abusive parents, or significant others. 

So, all we had were each other. 

I've seen homeless kids depicted on TV/movies as scrappy pickpockets. 

That's a lie. The kids who I hung with weren't brave enough to pick-pocket. 

If they saw cash/food/anything they wanted hanging around unclaimed, they would snatch it up. 

The pickpocket thing is just the media glamorizing the idea of being a street kid, turning them into a “fun, quirky group of teenage criminals trying to survive.”

The reality is a lot more depressing. 

I ended up in a group of kids on the south side of our town. 

Ben, the leader of our gang, was the latest to disappear. 

Look, I didn't believe in the “child catcher” rumors. 

I thought they were just stories—but it became evident someone was actually kidnapping street kids. 

I may have come from a toxic house, but I was sheltered. 

I didn't think things like that existed. 

I had never been in the type of situation when they COULD exist. 

Kidnapping was like a foreign concept to me. 

It only happened in movies and cartoons. 

But then familiar faces I knew started to disappear– Carly, a street performer who was trying to earn enough money to leave town. Jason, the weird kid with the eyepatch who tried to steal my phone. 

These kids weren't friends, but they felt comfortable. 

They felt like a community, even when I wasn't personally close with them. 

Carly always smiled at me, offering me fresh donuts some old man handed her in the morning. 

Jason was always skulking around the music stores, asking for change. 

Every time I saw him, we talked about things that didn't even matter. 

But talking to him made me feel less alone. When Jason disappeared, that normalcy I’d gotten used to started to fade. I looked for him, but his familiar purple woolen hat had vanished. 

Carly was always singing under the bridge every afternoon. 

I could hear her voice while snoozing in the park entrance. She sounded like an angel. 

With her gone, I felt colder than usual. 

I couldn't get warm no matter how many times I rubbed my hands together and stuck my them under my coat. I had holes in my socks and shoes, and the freezing chill was creeping into my bones. 

Carly’s disappearance really shook me. 

Especially when, several days later, a guy took her spot with his guitar, screaming out painfully bad reimaginings of pop songs. 

When Ben vanished, I started taking word-of-mouth more seriously. 

*""He's been taken by the white van,""*  was the rumor floating around. 

Apparently, some kid saw Ben getting dragged into a white van. 

This kid was also known to say BS to get attention, but his claim was actually believable. 

Ben, Carly, Jason, and the other missing kids were last seen at the homeless shelter. 

So, the place where kids were vanishing—wasn't exactly ideal.

But it *did* have hot soup and coffee, as well as a place to charge my phone, so I risked it.

The homeless shelter was where most kids hung out every day. 

I used the mostly broken facilities to shower, use the bathroom, and try to make connections with kids who were well known. It was pretty much a survival instinct at this point. 

If I was going to survive on the streets, I needed people I could count on. 

I had this constant need to get my name out there. Just in case I was one of the missing. 

But it turns out, not all homeless kids play nice. 

I won't go into detail, but there were a lot of names I thought I could trust, and quickly learned that I couldn't fucking trust anyone. 

I got my (first) phone stolen, and then my shoes were snatched while I was sleeping. 

I was definitely hardened after a while on the streets. 

So, when Charlie came along, I basically told him to go fuck himself. 

All of the ‘connections’ I made just lost me cash, food, and my shit. The worst thing you can be as a street kid is nice. 

If you want to be left alone, you have to make it very fucking clear.

Without Ben’s leadership, things went off the handle. 

I was quickly labeled as a naive bastard who f/w anyone. 

Most of my spots were compromised, so I had no choice but to once again risk the homeless shelter. 

My initial plan was to grab food and coffee, and make a run for it. 

I had the town library as a safe spot until 4pm, and after 10, the guy who owned the Chinese takeout begrudgingly let me sleep in his doorway. 

I think he felt sorry for me. But at this point I was too fucking cold to care about pride. 

The volunteers in the soup kitchen were my age. I didn't know them (thankfully), but I was eager to get out of there. 

The food was a choice of cold curry or soup. I chose soup, and a chunk of stale bread. 

The coffee was always lukewarm, but it was coffee. I wasn't going to complain. 

I was trying to eat it as fast as I could without burning my mouth, when a kid I can only describe as the human embodiment of a golden retriever slid next to me, grasping his own bowl of soup.  

With dark brown hair under his hood and freckled cheeks— not to mention his expensive jacket and shoes—I knew the streets would eat him alive.

This kid looked like he'd stepped right out of a perfect suburban home. 

He had a Mommy and Daddy, and a perfect fucking life. Lucky him. 

I was having  a hard time taking in his expensive clothes. 

Yes, his hair was greasy and his clothes were slightly discolored (holes in his gloves, dirt smearing his face) so he was clearly sleeping rough. 

But this guy was ASKING to get his branded coat stolen. 

""Take *that* off,"" I said through a mouthful of stale bread.

That was all I could say. I didn't want to say “hi”, because *hi” was an invitation to join me. I was on my third phone, and I wasn't taking any chances with this kid. 

Two years of fucking with the wrong people, I was done. 

I nodded at his jacket, and he looked confused. 

“Huh?”

""Put it in your backpack, idiot.” I was just warning him of my past mistakes. 

I DID have my dad's expensive watch, and some shoes I bought with money from a summer job before I left home. 

I lost both of them because I failed to hide them. 

Elizabeth and Mari, two older girls I thought I could trust, were now proud owners of my shit. 

The guy had this docile look on his face, eyes wide like a fucking deer. 

I had no idea how he had survived this long. If he was sleeping in the shelter, yes it was “safer”, and warmer, but it also made him a target for kidnapping. 

“Unless you *want* to lose it.” I added, finishing my soup. 

The guy continued eating, completely unbothered. 

“Your jacket.” I said, directly. 

I didn't lose my patience much, but this guy was testing me. 

“Take it *off*, or you will lose it.”

After being fucked around with by Ben’s asshole friends, it felt strangely good to be an asshole back to a total stranger. 

The kid hesitated, before pulling off his jacket and backpack, awkwardly yanking off the jacket, and stuffing it inside his bag.

Then he sat there shivering like an idiot, and I gave up and offered him one of my spare sweaters. 

Street kids usually wanted something in return, and I was waiting for his proposition.

Instead, he said, “Thanks!” and pulled it on.

“I'm Charlie.” he introduced himself, when I stood to leave, grabbing my own pack. 

I told him I didn't ask, and that it was nice meeting him. 

When he followed me, I thought we were just going the same direction. 

But then I took a turn down an alleyway, and his footsteps hesitated, before coming after me.

I was all ready to tell him to beat it, but Charlie looked lost. 

He had this look on his face, like he was trying and failing to look intimidating. 

This kid didn't look like he was going to steal my shit while I was sleeping. 

I didn't officially ask him to join me, it just sort of happened? 

When I got back to my spot, he dropped his pack and started unrolling his sleeping bag next to mine.

I took advantage of his kindness, that innocence that was yet to be drained from him by every stone-cold night that never seemed to end. 

Midnight and dawn felt like centuries apart, and I was never warm enough. 

My toes were always numb, my fingers losing all feeling. 

The worst part was when I didn't have enough to eat, so I started fantasizing. 

But Charlie never lost that stupid fucking smile. Even when he was freezing to death. 

I told him to grab us food for the night– and he came back with two pizza rolls, and a can of soda to share. 

I asked him *how* he'd gotten them, and he shrugged with a grin. 

This kid expected me to play along with his cryptic games every time he did something vaguely helpful. 

I didn't care how he'd gotten them. 

I was just thankful. 

I started to see Charlie as less of a nuisance, and more of a friend. 

Charlie was loud and obnoxious, and drove me insane with his ‘dreams’ of getting out of town and his situation. 

But he  made me smile—even in freezing temperatures. 

He never told me about *why* he was on the streets. 

Instead, he always changed the subject back to me. 

I didn't realize how self centered I was until I spilled my entire life story to him, and when he opened up about himself, I started talking about *myself* once again. 

In a way, I think I saw it like a competition. “Oh, your life is bad? Well, *this* happened to me.”

I waited for him to get frustrated or angry, but he just listened. 

He always listened. 

It was snowing when the two of us sat shivering on a wall, our legs dangling. 

I don't remember who's genius idea it was to sit in sub zero temperatures, but I remember enjoying the icy breeze on my face. Everything was covered in white. 

I don't think I should have enjoyed snow. 

It was extremely fucking easy to freeze to death in these conditions. 

But it was also *snow*. 

And I was still a stupid kid. I still liked snow. 

Charlie was, as usual, being his chipper self. 

He scored us a pack of chips to share, so we were passing it back and forth. 

My hands were so numb I couldn't even feel the chips. I just stuffed them in my mouth. ""Do you believe in angels, Finn?"" 

That question caught me off guard. Charlie’s gaze was glued to a little girl perfecting a snow angel in front of us. 

The answer was no.

I didn't believe in God. Any God's. Any religion. 

If God existed, or the “angels”, my parents wouldn't have kicked me out for liking guys. 

In the earlier days, I prayed for help.

I had the stupid idea that my mom would actually hunt me down and take me back home. 

But God didn't exist, at least not to me—and I was tired of pretending. 

I didn't respond to Charlie, and his head dropped onto my shoulder. 

I jerked back, swallowing a hiss. I shoved him away, and for the first time since I'd met him, his smile started to fade. 

""Sorry,"" he muttered, rubbing his hands together. Charlie seemed to notice our proximity, shuffling away from me. 

He said I was warm, and I hated myself for shouting at him. 

Because he was fucking warm too. 

I liked the feeling of his head on my shoulder. 

He felt safe and warm, and the closest thing I had to a home. 

I jumped off the wall, making an excuse to distance myself. 

I think I told him I was going to the shelter to try to find warm clothes from the lost and found. 

Charlie didn't reply, only jerking his head in a nod. 

He told me he’d be right there when I got back, and his words settled my twisting gut, the growing lump in my throat. 

I used my time away from him to come to terms with my feelings, and instead of pushing them away, like I had done for so long, suppressing and fucking swallowing them down, I realized I wanted Charlie to stay with me. 

Charlie was Home. 

I had barely known this kid for a few months, and yet with him, I didn't feel cold anymore. 

I went back to the wall, ready to apologize to Charlie, but to my surprise, he was gone. I figured he'd gone searching for food since it was almost around dinner time, so I waited. 

I waited until the sky was dark, and I was so fucking cold, my bones ached. 

I noticed an old man who was playing chess with pigeons earlier. 

Charlie had pointed him out, laughing at one particular pigeon, who seemed too self aware. 

I hurried over to him. 

“Did you see me earlier?” I twisted around, pointing at the wall the two of us sat on. 

The man nodded. “Oh, you're looking for your friend?” He slid another chess piece across the board. “I believe he walked away with a man a few hours ago now.”

“What man?” I felt like I was going to puke. 

I asked him to describe the guy, but the old man shrugged. 

“I have bad eyes, kid. It was just a man. Late forties, I think.” 

His expression softened when my stomach crawled into my throat. 

“Are you all right?” he reached into his pocket and pulled out a sour candy, dropping it into my hand. 

“You should go home now, kid. I'm sure your parents are worried about you.”

Again, I asked him to describe this man, this time through my teeth. 

But the old guy just turned back to his one-man chess game. 

I think part of me was in denial. 

I went back to our sleeping spot, expecting Charlie to be there, already comfortable in his sleeping bag, talking about optimistic BS. 

But he wasn't. 

I ran back to the shelter with his name choked in my mouth. 

I was living my own personal nightmare. Being snatched into the night, and nobody even knowing my name. 

I just got weird looks, kids looking progressively more freaked out. 

I wouldn't accept it at first. 

Charlie could have been anywhere. But the longer I waited for him in all of our spots, It became clear that Charlie was just another missing street kid who was there one minute, and gone the next. 

He was another Ben. 

Another Carly. 

But this time, I made the mistake of getting to know him.

He was more than a name. 

Charlie was my friend. 

I asked strangers if they'd seen him. 

Passers by looked me up and down like I was dirt on their shoe.

These people had places to be. 

They didn't care about some faceless kid disappearing from the street. 

I already knew what they were thinking when they offered pitiful smiles, and said things like: *“Sorry, I don't know.”*

*""I can't help you, kid. I'm... sure he's out there somewhere.""*

They were wondering *why* Charlie was sleeping rough in the first place. 

Why he didn't just ‘get help’. 

I'm going to tell you the hardest thing I've come to realize. 

It's easy to be numb on the streets. 

Easy to shut down. Easy to forget to mourn, because it was too fucking cold. 

I didn't forget about Charlie, but I did bury him, so I wouldn't forget how to survive. 

So, a month later, I thought I was fucking hallucinating when I saw that all too familiar jacket; the one I told him MULTIPLE TIMES to keep out of sight. 

It was snowing again, and it was thick and wet, clinging to my jeans. 

I was trying to find a patch of concrete free of snow to dump my sleeping bag. 

I scored hand warmers from one kid who was nice enough to offer them for a DS I'd found. 

There he was. Somehow. 

Charlie was standing in the middle of an empty road, in dead of night. 

I didn't question why or *how*. I just hugged him, mentally promising myself I would never let him go again. 

Charlie was so warm.

His coat was thicker, and his backpack was nowhere to be seen. 

""Where did you go?!"" I demanded, shoving him back. 

Charlie just smiled, and I noticed his pocket, an iphone sticking out. 

I think I was about to laugh, wondering just how he’d managed to get an iPhone, when a clammy hand suddenly clamped over my mouth. 

Warm arms wrapped around my torso and yanked me back. 

I screamed, but my cries were muffled—the hand clamping tighter until I couldn’t fucking breathe.

I remember being violently dragged back, my feet stumbling, my body struggling to stay upright.

I was dragged halfway down the street, hoisted onto a stranger’s shoulders, and dumped into the back of an awaiting van.

It didn't feel like it was happening to me. 

All those nights I had nightmares about being the next kid snatched away. 

I never thought it would be *me*. 

I couldn't even cry out, my body felt paralyzed. 

I was dragged backwards through snow, and then I was on my knees on the ice-cold flooring of a van jerking left to right, staring at shutters being pulled down like I was an animal. 

I dived forward, but I was trapped.

""I'm sorry, Finn,"" Charlie’s voice pricked the silence. The back of the van was so cold, and the smell was already there—potent, a thick, rotting decay.

“But you're the perfect body and shape for my father,” he said, his voice deadpan and wrong. 

“I hope this doesn't change things between us,” he whispered.

His voice was different—taunting and cold—sending shivers down my spine.

“We’re still friends, right?”

I fucking screamed at him.

That bastard.

He played the role so well, I should have fucking applauded him.

I slammed my fists into the shutters, but the ignition came to life, and the van jerked forward, sending me stumbling back.

I dropped to my knees, choking on the stink of decay. I didn't want to look.

The light was too bright, too invasive, scorching the chill from my skin.

I stayed on my knees until the smell got so bad, I had to fucking look.

In front of me were bodies. Most of them were faceless, with no features, skin already crumbling from bones jutting out.

One of them caught my eye, lying at the bottom of the pile.

Ben. His skin was gray, dried blood staining his face, painting his clothes. 

I was already trying to roll him onto his front, so I didn't have to look at him. His eyes were open, like he was still alive.

I shoved him onto his stomach, and something sour crawled up my throat, my stomach revolting.

I thought I was seeing things. But no.

When I reached forward, my fingers touched them—the twisted, feathery appendages protruding from twin slits cruelly sliced into a jutting spine.

I shuffled back, a cry clawing from my throat.

Wings.

They were rotten, decaying—the wings of a bird, or something else—spliced with his flesh. I could see where his back had been cut open, all the way down his spine. Ben was dead.

His wings were dying, festering inside a body that was ice-cold and alone, where he would never be found. That thought was quick to hit me. *Just like me*.

Carly’s short brown curls were buried under another corpse, a much younger kid.

I could still see the pale blue of her coat, her yellow hat still frozen to her head.

Carly had one singular wing sticking from her back, while the rest of her rotted away.

I tripped over something—Carly’s backpack.

I could glimpse Jason's kicks sticking out from the pile.

I couldn't look.

They had names. They were real kids. Carly. Ben. Jason.

They existed. Even if this world was so obsessed with fucking erasing them.

""Finn?"" Charlie's whisper slipped through the shutters.

I held onto his voice, willing it to be him.

Charlie.

""Do you believe in angels?” he asked me once again.

He still had that voice—that innocent, chipper tone I fell for.

But there was an unmistakable twisting madness clinging to every word.

I didn't respond. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

After a while, his voice stopped trying to get my attention.

I just sat, freezing cold, my arms around my knees.

I was going to fucking die.

I kept looking at the kids who vanished, their bodies twisted and contorted into a cruel fantasy. The van stopped when I was falling asleep, jerking me awake.

I heard footsteps outside. The shutters slid open, and in front of me, to my surprise, was a middle-aged woman.

Her smile was kind, despite the gleam in her eye.

She held out her arms, gesturing for me to come toward her.

“It's okay, honey,” she told me. “You're okay now.”

Charlie was standing next to her, his arms folded.

“Careful,” he muttered, nudging her. I saw his lip curl in disgust. 

Illuminated in the van’s headlights, I saw who really was; a spoiled, psychotic kid playing with his toys. 

Charlie mockingly stepped back. 

“He might attack you.”

Behind him stood a towering man, holding a gun pointing it between my eyes.

I had no choice, letting them pull me from the van.

The man was quick to slip a shot into the back of my neck, which turned my body to lead.

I was lifted into someone's arms. I remember they were warm.

The last thing I remember is a bright light getting closer.

I don't know how long I was out for. Long enough to get an actual, proper sleep.

When I opened my eyes, I was staring at the sun peeking through gaps in a wooden door, my head turned at an awkward angle. 

It looked like I was in some kind of farmhouse. I could see piles of hay and horse shit in the corner. I was lying on my stomach, my wrists pinned down. 

The pain crept in slowly—at first a dull thud, before slamming into me, agonizing lightning bolts striking down my spine.

So fucking painful, my vision blurred and feathered, losing focus.

I've had sensory issues since I was a kid, and I could feel the entirety of my upper back had been split open.

I could feel my own blood dripping down my skin, and something cruel and sharp forcing flaps of flesh apart. 

The thought of being cut open was enough to send me into fucking hysteria. I remember screaming until my throat was raw, until I passed out again. 

This time, it was a mercy. 

The pain wouldn't leave, pulling me into agony, and then letting me go.

When I came around for the second time, I felt the ice-cold scalpel slicing into my back.

But I didn't feel like I was cut open anymore. I felt a painful tugging when I tried to move. Stitches holding me together.

“That's all finished,” the man’s voice sounded. “The body is almost ready.”

“But when?”

That voice sent shivers creeping down my spine.

Charlie.

“You said that last time, and the last three angels *died*, Dad.” 

I could sense his rolled eyes. 

“Admit that you're just killing them, and you have no idea what you're doing.”

“I said he's ready,” the man grumbled.

“So, let him fly!” Charlie groaned. “Come on, Dad, I want to see the angel fly!”

I was aware I was gasping into the cold surface of the surgical table.

“His stitches are still fresh,” the man said. “When he's ready, you can play with him.”

I was left alone after that.

Hours.

Then, a full day.

But I wasn't hungry anymore. I wasn't thirsty. I didn't sleep.

I was trying to find the best position to lie on (on my side) when footsteps startled me.

“Hey, Finn.”

Charlie's voice was an excited whisper. I felt his warm fingers tiptoe down my back before reaching for my restraints.

He pulled them apart, helping me up, and I immediately dragged my hand down my back, where I was sure I’d touch my ugly, protruding spine. But instead, I felt smooth skin.

Slowly, I lowered myself off the table. Charlie was holding my backpack.

“Here!” he said excitedly, shoving it into my chest.

“Dad says I'm not allowed to let you go yet, but I'm too impatient.” 

His eyes never left my back.

Without responding, I took my backpack, shoved past him, and broke into a sprint.

I pushed through the doors of the farmhouse and kept running.

I expected to be grabbed and pulled back. But I wasn't. 

Charlie just stood there watching me, grinning, an inhuman grin stretched across his face. 

I didn't stop until I couldn't breathe, until I was on my knees, on some unfamiliar road in the middle of nowhere. 

I was picked up by a woman who offered to take me to the sheriff's station. She gave me hot tea and food, but I declined both. 

I wasn't hungry, and my body didn't feel like my own. 

When we got into town, and I was sure I knew where I was, I dived out of her car. 

I went to the restroom, pulled off my shirt, and ran my fingers down my back. 

I could *feel* them. 

Something was moving under my skin, twitching, like they were alive. 

When I gingerly touched my skin, I could feel tiny stitches all the way down my spine. 

Part of me wondered what would happen if I ripped them open. 

After a single restless night on the street, I realized I couldn't fucking do it anymore. 

I ended up asking for help when the pain in my back kept me up at night.

I could feel them physically trying to push through my skin, straining against my spine. I couldn't sleep on my back, or my side. The best sleeping position was lying on my stomach. 

Winter moved into spring, and I felt like I was dying. I couldn't eat, and I was weak. 

I think it was luck. Maybe a miracle. 

I walked into one of my old teachers. Mrs W. She didn't ask about my situation, but she did offer a place to stay. 

That was the best thing about Mrs W. 

No matter how much I knew she wanted to ask, she never invaded my privacy. She saw the scars on my back, saw me puke up everything I ate. 

But she didn't speak.

Mrs W asked me if I wanted to share anything with her, and I said, “No.”

If anyone knew what was inside my back, I’d be sliced open again. 

I was nineteen at this point– and I was tired and in too much pain to care about accepting handouts. 

Mrs W let me sleep in her spare room. She offered me food, but I could never eat it. 

I could only drink water, and even that was hard to stomach. 

She took me to the emergency room to get my back checked out, but after I suffered a panic attack at the thought of opening up to a doctor, she promised *no hospitals*. 

The pain got worse. It fucking laughed at medication. 

It got so bad, one night, I stood on the roof of Mrs W’s house, and let the pain take over, ripping through me, until something was splitting my spine, sending me to my knees.

I could feel them coming through, breaking through my skin.

They felt wrong and awkward, like additional limbs. I panicked, and with shaking hands, forced the twitching *things* back into twin slits. 

That did relieve the pain.

I still couldn't eat or drink, but I started to feel human again. 

Mrs W offered to send me back to school, and I did. I went back to finish high school. 

The eating/drinking thing got easier. 

I think my body just got used to it. 

After school, I got into community college, and Mrs W helped me buy my first place. 

I grew up, with the gnawing feeling that something wasn't *right* with me.

The pain was still agonizing, and at times, I would have to rip open the stitches, and let them free. I've never once tried to figure them out, because I'm fucking terrified of them. 

I'm 29 now. 

I live far away from my hometown. I have a boyfriend, and an apartment, and I finally feel human again. 

Last night, I was waiting for a train home. It was freezing, and already, I could feel my back twitching, pain starting to gnaw at me. 

It's worse these days. Not just the pain. I'm sleepwalking. 

I'll find myself blocks away from my house, with no recollection of how I got there. 

I don't know why I'm no different from my teenage self. 

I still don't want to ask help, because whatever is inside me isn't fucking human. 

So, I kept my mouth shut. 

There was a homeless girl slumped in the corner of the platform. 

I've made it my goal. 

Whenever I see a homeless kid, I point them to the nearest shelter– and when they roll their eyes at me, I offer to take them there myself. 

I don't leave them until I know these kids are safe. Yes, they can be difficult.

They're a lot more vocal these days. Kids hate authority figures. 

Especially authority figures that failed them. 

But I want to make it clear to them that they CAN ask for them. And there IS help. 

I was already halfway across the platform when I glimpsed familiar brown curls nestled under a green beanie. 

I knew it was him. He was wearing that exact same jacket, clinging to a wider frame. He was taller, his face more matured, with a five o’clock shadow, talking loudly on an expensive phone.

I took my eyes off of the girl for one second. 

One second. 

I turned back to her, and she was gone. Just like that. 

When I searched the crowd, I caught her blonde ponytail behind her. 

A man pulling her through strangers. 

I started forwards, when someone pulled me back. 

“No, Finn.” Charlie's voice was in my ear, suddenly. 

“She has the perfect shape and body for my father,” he murmured. 

His voice kept me paralyzed, while the girl was getting further and further away, before becoming a speck, and then bleeding into nothing. 

“I want to see you fly, Finn,” Charlie whispered. 

I twisted around, and he was gone. 

When I left the train station, sitting on a bench was his old threaded backpack. 

Nothing inside, but I know why he left it. 

He's telling me he's watching me. 

Charlie is bragging that he's taking more kids right in front of me. 

I've looked everywhere for the girl, and I can't find her. 

When I asked a group of street kids, they were defensive, clearly not trusting me, before I warned them someone was kidnapping them. 

They told me three guys, and a girl (the blonde) have all vanished. 

I asked *when*, and that's when they started getting suspicious. 

They left without telling me, and I've spent the last week looking for these kids. 

The only way I'm going to find these kids is to find the sick bastard who took me. 

Before he does to them, what he did to Ben, Carly and Jason.

1qm4avk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1qm4avk/my_first_run_in_with_an_avoidant/,My first run in with an avoidant,"Ok so, in 2024 i was freshman year at university, i moved from my home, and so i was a total stranger there. First lecture I see a girl, i find her super attractive, and shes objectively really hot, the next day she and another girl come up to me, saying how they want to sit next to me. Turns out, theyre twins. We started talking then and there, bond a little bi whatever. The next month i see she likes talking with men, even though she told me things how shes happy to see me, how im handsome, how were close, i was cautious because i saw the signs. The thing is im very confident in myself and i know my values, but with this girl, i had to be careful not to fall in love. We would reguralrly walk back home together, she would subtly pull me out of groups so we would walk seperate etc. Long story short, whenever i would ask her out, she would have an excuse not to go, they werent lies, but she wouldnt give another date, but would still be warm in person, i then set boundaries and she acted like a divorced ex whenever she would se me. After a while she told me how i should smile more, how i look better when i smile etc. At one point i wanted to tell her how this dynamic doesnt make sense, how its going nowhere and isnt benefiting me at all, but she then procedeed to propose a coffee with me, i accepted, and we sat there for hours, talking, she sat right next to me, not across. We had a lot of common interests and crazy chemistry, we would sometimes match eye contact and not stray the gaze for a few seconds at a time, really quick to flirt aswell, we bounced of eachother really well. I walked with her to her home, I said: don't know about you, but i had a great time. She replyed: I had a wonderful time. We hugged and parted ways. When i wanted to make plans again, she again gave an excuse. I then went to my home town for summer, came back and she wanted to rekindle, we went out once more, this time with her twin. We were together for hours again, her sister told me how i ""have her"", she told me how were not friends and stuff, they asked me about my relationship history, and the conversation was so natural, she even commented on it. Whenever i would tease her or say something daring her sister would giggle, and she sat next to me, not her. I couldnt help but fall in love there, i mean she was my perfect type physically, and we could spend hours together seemlessly. The following day i texted her and told her how i had a great time, and how i wanted to spend more solo time with her, she said:sure, well keep in touch. After that, when i asked her out, she told me:Listen, I really hope you dont take this the wrong way, but im not for us going ut at this moment, i have some things i need to take care of, i hope we can stay in good relations. I was livid, in that moment, all the confusion, mixed signals, incosistencies she gave me spilled out, but i didnt insult her, it was just a lot that i was not speaking up about and i just let her have it. At that time, i thought that she was just messing with me/waiting for another guy to ask her out while she was just entertaining me, but i thought how that actually couldnt be true. I then found out about avoidant attachment, and suddenly, the hot and cold behaviour, the at first glance random pullbacks, the slow replies; electric chemistry, deep talks and physical attraction, but refusal to spend more time together; It all made perfect sense, since than, we have had very minimal contact, she liked one of my instagram stories and watches them very early almost always, but i havent acted on any of that, we saw eachother for the first time a couple weeks ago, the spark was still present, although a little less electric. Im not scared of trying again, life is too short for that, its just that i feel like theres no hope of her being with me until she heals, and i cant influence that.",1,1769301862.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

This is my first time posting a story, I’ve taken it down to try and fix the indentations and to make it more digestible to read. With that being said, I’m excited to read everyone else’s stories and any and all feedback is welcome! 

When my mom and I moved to a rural area we weren’t sure what to expect. We lived in those copy and paste neighborhoods where every single house got built at the same time and looked completely alike. So saying it was a big change was an understatement. It is odd to say but I miss seeing people. I wouldn’t call myself a people watcher, but being able to understand that everyone I am looking at has their own life outside of my perception is always a topic that interests me. 

When you look at someone you make up your own tale of their entire being. In one minute, you could think you have someone completely figured out. All I see now is greenery, trees surround our home and that is the extent of it. I hear no people talking, no kids laughing. Only the tune of our windchimes and the occasional plane that would fly over us. And even then I would catch myself thinking of where those people are going.  I would ask my mom why she would want us to move this far out and all she would say is “Privacy, I want to be able to leave my home and not see a single house outside besides my own.”. 

As much as I understood her answer, I wished she would see it from my perspective. We moved over an hour away from my friends, my old school, and basically everything I have ever known. It sadly has made us resent each other. She wishes I would just move on and accept the change, I wish she would pack everything up and move us back. We spend a lot of days not talking to one another, a quick glance to acknowledge each other's presence then move on with our day. 

Close to a month ago we had a conversation about the pole barn that was on our property. When we moved we got 15 acres of land along with a barn that was left. It was pretty nice to have, as we used it to store our cars and extra miscellaneous items that we didn’t have places for in our house.

 “So I don’t know if you saw but there was mouse shit on one of the window sills in the barn. I'm nervous that if it gets into our stuff it’ll ruin it all.” My mom said while making her coffee. “Well we do live in the middle of nowhere, so I am not sure what you expect.” I am half awake at this point trying to acclimate my eyes to the light, she's getting ready to head out to work and I'm getting ready for school. I sit at our dinner table that can seat 7 more but normally it is just me, on the rare occasion we sit there together but on different sides. 

My arm is on the table assisting me by keeping my head from drooping down and falling back asleep.  “I don’t need you to point out the obvious Lucy. I am saying this because I think we should get a barn cat. It will catch whatever is in there and stop it from fucking up our stuff.” She at this point was turned around facing me, her face constantly looking as if she was about to blow a fuse. She holds so much tension even in such mundane moments. I wish she would relax sometimes. 

We had a cat a long time ago, he was my mom’s when she was in college and he got to be a part of my life and watch me grow up. He was over 15 years old when he passed, it hit my mom a lot harder than I thought it could. Her suggesting getting another animal, seems like a big step in her grieving process. “I think that would be great! My only question is when and where are we going to get one?” I exclaimed, probably being too loud for it only being 6 in the morning. Her eye twitches, “One of the guys at work has a cat that gave birth a couple weeks ago, 5 healthy kittens; 2 boys and 3 girls. I wanted to ask you for your opinion before I left because I can pick one up after we get out.” 

So that was it. We looked at the picture her coworker sent of them all and I chose the one that I wanted her to get. He was an all black cat with a white patch on the front. I was holding my excitement and trying to not get too attached because I knew my mom wouldn’t let him in the house. He is only supposed to catch mice and live in our barn, that is it. 

Fast forward until yesterday, I woke up early and ran to open up the barn door to let Vader out. I put on slides and wrapped a blanket around my shoulders. It isn’t a long walk, probably less than a minute to get up to the porch. The grass is covered in morning dew, I feel my skin absorbing the sun as if it didn’t see it just the day before. I will say, where we live now the way the morning feels is completely different. It is quiet and calming. The surrounding area looks more vibrant and lush. The trees expel what feels like the most nourishing air that you could ever breathe. 

I get up to the entrance of the barn, I locate the key that is hidden in a magnetic box. We attach the box under our grill so we don’t need to carry the key with us. It is always there and accessible for when we need it. He is so vocal that before I even finish unlocking the door he is chattering and making his presence known. The door is open and he runs out, only for him to turn around and beg me for his breakfast. We have made a routine, if we don’t follow it he will meow outside of the house until we get him back on schedule. 

I head back down to our house once he is all set, I see him get as low to the ground as he can and walk slowly towards a bird. The wind almost sounds like it stops in order to not blow his cover. He pounces at it only to completely whiff. Yet, he remains determined. He has caught 5 mice at this point. It is gross but on occasion we see little carcasses or body parts in our yard. I feel bad for them because it seems like they go out in the worst way possible. 

“Alright I am going to work, are you good to be here most of today by yourself?” My mom questioned, she is actively walking away from me and I was lucky I heard most of the question. “What do you mean, it is Saturday? What do you need to go in for?”, “They offered overtime and we need the money, is that a good enough explanation for you ""mom? ""."" She said that with a scathing tone in her voice. She does these things that she knows gets under my skin.  

“I don’t understand why you take everything I say so personally. I don’t do everything with malicious intent, so why does it feel like you do? All I did was simply ask you a question and you just spit back at me as a response, it is frustrating.” Tears swell in my eyes, I try to regulate my anger towards her, but it feels like her foot is stepping on my throat and all I can do is watch her continue to push down with all her might. “How about, I simply asked you a question last night, do you even remember what it was? How do you think the cat got put up, hm? You were asleep in your room and I had to get up in the middle of the night because I heard that fucking cat screeching outside our house. I asked you to put him up before it got dark, one simple fucking request yet I was the one who had to do it. You not listening yet acknowledging and saying you will do what I asked is frustrating and it's old. You are grown enough to handle this. Please for the love of god start acting like it.”. 

She said this all while walking around the house like a chicken with its head cut off. She was taking her hair rollers out, putting her socks on and packing her lunch box. How can she say these things while not even looking at me once. I didn’t have a good response though. I did say I would put him up, and completely forgot and went to bed. But as much as I tried not to, I couldn’t help but oppose her argument. “He is a cat mom, being outside one night won’t hurt him. You see how he gets the mice, he is more than able to defend himself. So is it really that big of a deal or are you just making it one so you can find something to yell at me for?”. She freezes. Her face was red and her lips scrunched into her face. The whites in her eyes have never been so prominent and her eyebrows arched so much that they could’ve been touching. The tension was so high, I could hear my own heart racing. I knew I shouldn’t have said what I did, but when she has such a vindictive tone while spewing cruel words in my face, it feels like in the moment, that that is the only thing I can do. 

She walks up to me, we are the same height so she just stares straight into my eyes. “I am going to work. Put. the cat. up. Tonight.”. I sit there tongue tied. Tears at this point are coming out consistently. We don’t blink, almost feeling like we are seeing who will look away first. While still looking at me she grabs her purse off the counter next to us, brushes against me and scuffs out the door. I stand there for a moment, taking in what just happened. This is all we were anymore. I miss who I thought she was. I miss being too young for confrontation. Here I was again, alone in our house. The house I never even fucking wanted. 

I lay down on our living room couch, our window is open and I see the cat chasing after leaves. I use my sleeve and wipe my face and chuckle at how hard he is trying. I turn on the tv and mindlessly scroll on my phone. I enjoy having the background noise, it helps me not feel just how bare our home is. I cry a bit reminiscing on the argument, I make all my own meals and lay back down. I was circling the same room trying to see if after this lap something would be different. Kitchen, living room, bedroom back to living room. 

Once I finally found a show I enjoyed, against my mom’s wishes I ended up falling asleep on our sofa. 

I wake up hours later, sweat dripping down my neck and my eyes feeling like they are glued shut. How long did I nap for? As I sat up rubbing my eyes, I caught a glimpse of my mom running in her room and slamming the door. It felt like she was gone at the speed of light. I heard her feet behind me and she was gone the next. I stood up and stretched all my limbs, I was about to knock on her door when it finally hit me. “The fucking cat.” I whispered to myself. 

Shit, shit, shit. I didn't even grab a jacket, I slid my shoes on and ran outside. It was dark out, it's odd. She never works until it is dark but the way she ran into her room it feels like she just got home. “Vader! Where are you buddy?”. I yell out into the dark woods. It feels like a kids drawing where they only draw the things right in front, excluding everything else that doesn’t matter to them. They will draw only their house, neglecting the fact that they have neighbors that live right alongside them.  

We have one motion light on the barn porch but besides that it feels like everything surrounding me was colored with jet black paint. No details or forms, just obscured. “Kitty? You gotta go back inside, it is bedtime!” I stand on the porch puzzled. He is always either sitting on our house deck, or right outside the barn waiting to get put up. 

Motion light turns off. 

I swing my arms in order to turn it back on so I can find the grill and get the key to unlock the door. What the heck? It was gone. I turned in circles trying to see where it could be. Who would’ve moved it? I stepped slowly to the door, turned the handle and it opened with ease. Maybe my mom already put him up and accidentally brought the keys inside.

 “Vader, you in here?” I walk around our barn. Moms car, my car and moving boxes stacked on top of one another with no rhyme or reason. It feels almost like a loft, studio apartment. Cement floor, high ceilings, but nothing inside is finished, only wooden beams and exposed steel decorate this building. 

I try to locate Vader, but he is nowhere to be found. I walk to the front of my car only to find the most disgusting pile of meat. Animal meat. I see little organs, intestines and so much blood. My arms feel numb and my legs feel like at any moment they can just collapse. Maybe a raccoon got in and Vader killed it! Yeah that had to be it. He is probably hurt somewhere from the fight. I mustered up any strength I could find left in my legs and ran back out.

 “VADER PLEASE COME BACK, WHERE ARE YOU!” I sound so silly calling after an animal that I know can’t respond back. I look into the dark woods, it is hopeless that I could find anything there. I turn my phone flashlight on to give me more clearance. I see two glowing orbs in the treeline to the right of my house. 

Motion light turns off.

 “Vader there you are, you scared me!” I felt so much relief flush through my veins. I started walking in the grass towards the void, but something made me stop dead in my tracks. The glowing eyes started to get taller. Slowly I saw them rise up, too high to be vader, to be any animal at this point. It started stepping out towards me and all I could think of doing was getting more light so I can see what this thing was. I slowly walked backwards towards the barn porch, activating the light once again. 

This time I saw the horror that has been hiding in the woods this whole time, and sadly the optimistic idea I had of what I found in the barn was at this point proven wrong. It was a man. I couldn’t tell his age, he was naked and hunched over so far that I couldn’t even see his stomach. He stood there with a blank expression, arms not at his sides but folded in front of him, almost looking like he touched something gross. He was completely covered in blood, and the glowing eyes I saw were not his own, but the eyes of my skinned cat he wore upon his head. Almost as if he was showing off his accomplishment. 

Vader's poor head sat on top of his, and the man tied his paws together under his chin with what looked like twine. I can’t move, I can’t even breathe. This is all my fault. I fucking fell asleep and this is what happened because I didn’t put him up. My face feels hot, I don’t even know what time it is and I don’t know what to make of the situation ahead of me. 

I am too far away to activate the motion light.  

It is silent, almost sounds like the wind came to a halt and all that is left is me and this man doing a staring contest. In the pitch black, my phone is still locked onto his location then all I hear is this ear pitching screech. He starts making the noise a cat makes when it is mad. It starts out low but only gets louder the more angrier he gets. It is deep and guttural. It transitions into a human scream and he pounces towards me. I hear twigs and branches break as he lunges his big body towards me, trying to close the gap between us. I sprint into my house, not looking back once. 

He is still screaming as he chases me, and what scared me the most was it didn’t sound like he was out of breath once. It had the same tempo, not breathy and not faulting as he ran. Just fueled with straight anger. I got in the house and locked the door just in time. He starts throwing his body at the house. Full force flinging his entire being at the screen door. Why is he not trying to use his hands to open it? I didn’t have time to think of the technicalities, so I ran straight to my mom. 

“Mom please wake up, please help! Vader is dead! There is a-” I opened her bedroom door. She is on all fours on her bed, like the man she is naked as well. Her back arches in the most feline way, her spine pushing against her skin. It looks like if she were to go any further in an arch her spine would tear away at her flesh. I hear the cracks of all her bones. I see each bump of her vertebrae peeking through.  She quickly whips her head in my direction and hisses so loud a fall back, the edge of our sofa breaking my fall. “MOM PLEASE!” I howled. Me addressing her only seemed to piss her off more. She jumps off her bed and begins to run towards me. 

I get up and run to my room. Our one floor house has never felt so big and obscure. I got to my room and quickly locked it before she was able to reach me. Her nails start scratching at my door. I see almost instantly her nails begin to bleed, carpet and paint from the door digging into her nail beds. She stretches her hand as far as she could under the door frame and continues to do so until her fingers go raw, and even once they hit that point she doesn’t stop. “Mom please stop! I can’t do this please, I need you!” I sob into my hands because at this point I can’t handle the site of her hands slowly turning into what looks like raw ground beef. 

I begin to see the bones in her finger tips, and she gets angrier and angrier everytime I say “mom”. In the midst of trying to find out what to do I hear a thud at my window. The man now has Vader in his hand. He is pounding the flaccid skin of my cat against my window, so much so that he begins to deteriorate on the window pane. I hyperventilate not being able to understand why this is happening. “Stop, STOP THAT, HE IS ALREADY DEAD PLEASE JUST STOP!”. It almost feels like he is rubbing in the fact that I was a neglectful owner. He is showing me that this is your pet, the safety that was up to you to withhold is now in my hands. You didn’t put him back in the barn, so he is mine now. And you have no one to blame but yourself.  

I close the curtains and open my closet door and sit down. I undo a wire hanger and fold it a couple times in order to make some sort of defense tool. I have nothing in my room better, I didn’t think I would need to defend myself especially not in these fucked up circumstances. I can’t watch my mom hurt herself more so I say her name quietly to myself in the closet where she can’t hear me. “Mom, I am so sorry. I love you. I didn't mean for all this to happen. Please just stop. Please.” My head is faced down, my knees held up to my chest. 

I am the only person I have now that can tell me it’ll be okay, that as long as you keep trying that is all that matters. I don’t want to keep trying, I don’t want to possibly come to the scenario of having to defend myself against the woman who gave birth to me. And that man.. Thing. I don’t even know what to do with that. I can’t beat him, I can’t win no matter the circumstance. 

I stay faced towards the door so if by chance it opens, I can charge with everything I got. I wait, and I wait. The scraping noises slowly die down and the banging at the window comes to a halt. I tried staying up, I couldn’t possibly sleep with them outside of my room. They are able to come in, bang the door down, use a hairpin to shove into the doorhandle to unlock my door. But for some reason, they are not doing those things. Almost as if they don’t know how or are unable to do so. 

What felt like hours passed I ended up falling asleep even though I did my best not to do so. I woke up and it was quiet. I opened the door and tiptoed out. I slowly go to my window, moving the curtain ever so slightly so no one could tell it was even opened. There it is again. The morning dew, the encapsulating sun. The bird that Vader chased yesterday sits perched on a branch. I see residue left on the window, I gag and try to keep the contents of my stomach down where it belongs. 

I turn towards the exit. Is she still out there? I walked towards the door, feeling like I was under so much pressure to remain silent. I knew which floor boards creaked in my room, I had to memorize it so I could sneak out. 

Once again, going against my mom’s wishes.

 My hand upon the door handle I twisted it slightly only to come to an immediate stop. I didn’t see any light come from under the door frame. What felt like a crude dream proved to be real when I looked under the door and all I saw was skin. 

I put my ear to the door and heard light snoring from my mom. So light that it could be mistaken for purring. I lay down, press my back against the door. In a weird way this was calming. I was with my mom again and she was just sleeping. Almost like when I used to sneak into her room when I had nightmares. She knew I was there, I was never sneaky no matter how much I tried. She would hold me and brush my hair from my eyes. She would tuck me into bed with her and hearing her breathing helped me know that I was safe. And hearing it now is no different.  

I know my fate, I think at some point last night I accepted what is to come. All I can do is lay down with my mom one last time. Knowing that as soon as I open up this door everything I know will come to an end. I just wished I listened, I wish I wasn’t so eager to prove her wrong. Vader didn’t deserve this, and neither did she. I drop my makeshift dagger, and close my eyes. “Goodnight, mom.”. I moved my mouth to those words, no sound coming out. I go back to sleep knowing that this will be the last time I spend with her, numb yet tranquil. ",1,1769301724.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1qm42el,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1qm42el/aio_for_blocking_my_best_friend_because_of_her/,AIO for blocking my best friend because of her toxic boyfriend?,"Hey everyone, this is my first time using Reddit, but I've been thinking of posting this for a while because I'm just so rattled by this whole experience and I feel like I might have made a huge mistake!!   
This is really long (sorry!) and needs a decent amount of context so I'll just get to it.

(TL;DR, my best friend's boyfriend hates me and convinced her to end our friendship. I think he's trying to isolate her and I fell right into the trap.)



**Part One: Before The Boyfriend**  
  
I (23F) met my best friend, Flora (23F), in 2018 when we were in high school. We had a mutual friend who introduced us and we hit it off pretty quickly: we both liked the same things and had the same favourite colour, and though I'd never been in a relationship before, she always came to me for advice. Oh, also, I'm bisexual and she's straight, which is important for later.

Anyway, we became really close (think, platonic soulmates, always hung out at each other's houses and did the whole 'best friends forever, us against the world' type of thing. Her home life wasn't the greatest - her mum was always on her case and blew up over the smallest things, plus she dated really shitty guys and let them move in with them rent-free. Flora played the caregiver role at home, looking after her grandmother and younger brother, and taking charge of the household tasks. We would send each other extremely long voice notes to vent about things (mostly her home life and later, her relationships) and were both really good at replying diligently. We texted everyday but didn't call much.   
She was selfless and sweet, and no matter how crazy her life got, she'd always make time for me. I really loved her.

So, as with most kind people, Flora had the worst taste in men. In high school she dated a few guys who were immature (many thought we were secretly together because I like girls and we were so close) and manipulative (threatening to end their lives if she broke up with them), and I was always the shoulder to cry on. After high school, she was single for a bit, the longest I'd ever known her to be, and then she unfortunately met her most recent ex, Cole (24M). Cole promised her marriage and kids and a life away from her controlling mother. She fell so fast for him and planned out their life together. I, of course, would be her maid of honour (despite my saying I didn't think he was right for her). They dated for about a year before the red flags became way too blatant to ignore, and she broke up with him. After months of stalking, harassment, and threats of ending himself, she finally got away from him. 

I thought she'd take a break from dating after that horrible year. It took so much out of her, and out of me as her only emotional support. But Flora jumped straight into dating again. It was then I realised that she was the kind of person who can't be single. She had hobbies, friends, and uni, so it wasn't like she was bored. I think she just wanted someone to love her unconditionally and to be able to give her a new life. I thought that person would be me, because she was my number 1 as well and we'd planned to get an apartment together. But I suppose a friendship isn't the same as a romance. I get that now, having met my girlfriend. Mine and Flora's friendship, while so fulfilling, doesn't compare in the same way. 

  
**Part Two: Announcing, the Toxic Boyfriend**

A few months after Cole, Flora met Dylan (24M) on a dating app. He was a biker, she was a book girl, it's literally the stuff she dreamed of. I was happy for her because he genuinely seemed like a good person and he treated her so well. He met her family, and took her on dates, and since he had a stable job and everything, they began to plan their life together. They were dating for about 10 months before I even met him.

  
I always thought it was weird because we're best friends and she said I'm the one he has to win over in order to stay in her life, yet she only planned a meetup 10 months after they got together?? Whatever, it was fun, we got along well enough. But then something happened that totally changed everything.   
Dylan and Flora had a huge fight.   
Like, asking for his hoodie back and changing their matching profile pictures kinda fight. I assume that's like a huge thing in straight relationships.  
They'd had fights before that she vented to me about, but this one was so bad that I told her it might be better if she broke up with him because he was immature and discarded his feelings easily. Obviously, I only knew her side of the story, and yes, I'm biased towards my best friend, but she was crying and hurting and he was the person making her feel that way - the obvious solution was to actually break up with the guy. 

Spoiler, they didn't break up.

Then a few weeks later, he's going through her phone (specifically, our chat) and comes across the conversation we had about him being immature and discarding his feelings easily. And he gets mad. Really, really, mad. This guy acts as if I said the worst thing in the world about him! It was so insane. I felt really sick. He'd invaded our private space and read our conversations that were not meant for him. They had another fight about how she shouldn't bring their fights up with me because I'm not involved in their relationship. At first, I didn't understand that because in my mind, I was Flora's only support system outside of him, so of course she'd vent to me about her issues. Of course we'd talk about it.   
But now that I'm dating my girlfriend, I suppose I understand. I don't talk about our fights with anyone, mostly because I keep remembering this event and what Dylan said. 

So, yeah, Dylan was super mad at me. Flora felt torn between two of her favourite people and she was hurting a lot so I said I would apologise to him and we can start over. We had a conversation over text about it, and we both apologised and agreed to move on and start fresh. We met up a few times after that and things were cool. No issues whatsoever.   
(Except, there were because Dylan is such a manchild that he couldn't get over what I said.) 

And thus began this weird feud he had with me. It lasted for months and in that time, Flora and I grew more distant (work was a factor, of course, plus I'd started dating my girlfriend so I was juggling my time a lot). We barely texted, and when we did, it was playing catch-up on our lives. We never hung out because every weekend she would go out with Dylan. It was exhausting trying to make plans with her. I kept trying, until eventually we had a serious talk about how I felt we were drifting and I didn't want that to happen. She said she'd make more of an effort to see me. So we made plans for a big group hangout on Sunday that week.   
  
On Saturday, she went out with Dylan.   
On Sunday, she came over to mine.  
  
From the jump, something was wrong. She kept texting Dylan the whole time, looking really stressed. Turns out, he was mad that she kept her plans with me and didn't drop them to see him. He was in a sour mood because the plans he'd made with his friends fell through and he wanted her to see him. That whole day, I tried to stay focused on the hangout with everyone while also consoling her because, surprise surprise, they broke up again. 

And the weirdest part is, she said she felt relieved. Things were tense for weeks and their 1 year anniversary was awful because they'd had another fight. She told me she was feeling better about the breakup after we talked.   
Then she went home.   
And they got back together.   
That's when she told me about him hating me. At first, I thought it was because he was worried she was cheating on him with me, as most of her exes did. But once she explained, I admit, I didn't keep my cool. I went off about him still holding a grudge, ruining our hangout, and making her feel like shit when things are bad between them.   
But she told me all couples fight and that he 'had a really good reason for being so upset'. She wanted to work through it with him, so they were going to work through it. I told her I'd support her. And... I tried... but I couldn't do it. I talked to her a lot about how she deserves someone who doesn't bring up things she confided in about, only to use as insults in an argument. She said she agrees but she still wanted to be with him. Eventually, I couldn't take it and told her I'm not happy she's with him. I think that was mistake number 1. 



**Part Three: Mistake Number 2**

We drift some more. We catch up. We promise to work at being friends. Repeat ad nauseam.

Then one day I'm getting ready for work and I get a text from Flora. It reads something like this -

*Flora: Hey, can I talk to you about something difficult?*

Naturally, I jump into protective best friend mode. 

*Me: Of course, I have time now. Do you want to call?*

Flora says she'd rather text and then she types for a long time. A really long time. I finish getting ready for work and *ping* there's a giant text from her. 

  
*Flora: This is really difficult and I love you a lot but we need to take a step back from our friendship.* 

Cue, confusion, disbelief, and the most intense sadness. From that one line alone I can feel myself start to shake. 

  
*Flora: Dylan and I have been talking about our future plans and how we want to do life together, and how situations involving people close to us affect that.* 

She goes into detail about how he couldn't come to her graduation because I was there. How she wishes things were different because she loves us both so much. How if the roles were reversed, and if one of Dylan's friends didn't like her, she wouldn't have 'the strength and patience to try as he did with you'. That one hurt a lot.   
Basically, she said it would be hard to be close because she can't split her life in two and live like a child of divorce with her life events.   
(Sorry if I'm being vague about this part it makes me so sad to reread those texts, and yeah I just... it hurts a lot.)

I called my girlfriend just sobbing, and I could barely focus at work after this. She came over to my place as soon as she could to comfort me and sat with me while I typed out a response. There was back and forth about feelings and my stance on her relationship and our friendship and how sad I was that she would throw me away like that. He literally told her if she stays friends with me he'd break up with her. She said she was sad too and she didn't want this. I had a lot of feelings about everything and I tried to phrase in a way that wasn't accusatory towards her (I was more mad at him than her at this point). In the end, I told her that all I want for her is to be happy. And that as long as she's truly happy, I'll be okay with what she wants to do.   
So she talked to Dylan again and he *graciously* allowed her to be friends with me again.

We texted for a few days, then she didn't reply to a message of mine, and I didn't follow up with her. Two weeks went by. The longest we'd ever gone without talking to one another (and this was the kind of friendship where we'd message good morning with cute nicknames every day).   
My mental health crumbled so quick. I was having anxiety attacks all the time, my work was suffering, my whole world just felt so dull and meaningless. My girlfriend was the best person ever during this whole time. She let me talk about it for hours, and cry, and be mopey and sad. Eventually it got a bit much for her and she said while she supports me wanting to stay friends with Flora, she doesn't think this friendship is worth saving. We disagreed a lot during this time and she felt the pressure of being my only support through it (I hadn't told any of my other friends or my family even though we're all close to Flora), so I promised I'd get my mental health back on track.   
And I thought that fixing my friendship with Flora was the answer to that.

So when she messaged saying how hurt she was that I hadn't texted her for two weeks, I was completely honest about what I needed from this friendship. And we both agreed on the boundaries and such. The most important thing was that I told her that if she ever does a friendship breakup with me again, I'm done. This was the line I was drawing. She said she understood, that all my points were valid, and she won't do it again.  
Mistake number 2 was thinking we'd be fine.

  
**Part Four: The Final Chapter**

So... I was still feeling really hurt. My mental health wasn't doing any better. My girlfriend didn't want to continue her friendship with my best friend, and I understood the stress Flora must have felt. But the difference is, my girlfriend never once threatened to break up with me if I stayed friends with her. She said she'd attend the events I planned even if Flora would be there. She'd be polite, but she wouldn't engage. I was grateful she was even willing to do all that. 

Things were tense and awful but Flora and I tried to go back to how we were. It felt forced on my end, like I was pretending to be her friend. I loved her, I wanted her to be happy. I wanted to be in her life. But though she promised she'd make time to hang out with me, she didn't. She promised she'd make it up to me by taking me out for coffee so we could talk face to face about everything, and then the one free afternoon she had, she took a coworker for coffee instead. Finally, one Saturday, she said she could pick me up to run an errand with her and we'd make a day of it.   
I was so excited. 

It was really nice. We did some Christmas shopping and had lunch together and talked about everything. Absolutely everything. The decision we came to (and I was riding the high of our hangout, so I happily relayed all this to my girlfriend, who looked at me like I was the most naive person ever) was that we'd keep our respective relationships out of our friendship with each other. No mutual events, no crossovers. Her future wedding wouldn't include my girlfriend in the guest list, and her boyfriend was banned from all the hangouts I planned. A stupid plan, in hindsight.   
  
She drops me off at my girlfriend's place. We say how much we mean to each other. We both part ways feeling like best friends again.   
  
My girlfriend and I have a fight at her place about the situation. It was ugly, in all honesty, but we figured it out and were good after a few hours.   


I go home and see a text from Flora. She says that she's had a fight with Dylan. Her profile picture isn't the two of them anymore. Naive me thinks this is it, there's no coming back from another huge fight like this. They're breaking up for good.   
  
Her profile picture changed back to the two of them, and the one she broke up with was me.

Below are screenshots of our final conversation. I was pissed, as you can tell. And so I blocked her. 

But it's been a couple of months and I miss her so much. I know she was a terrible friend to me in the end, but I wasn't perfect either. And I know if she broke up with her boyfriend, we would still be best friends. He's not a nice person to her when things are bad. And things are bad so often. If she leaves him, I know she could find someone who isn't threatened by her having such a close best friend. And I wonder... have I doomed her to rely on him forever by choosing to walk away from our friendship? I think I made a mistake by cutting her off. Yes, I'm sad at her choices, but I think he's the problem, not her. I'm worried he's trying to isolate her from her other relationships, and I've fallen for it.  
  
So, AIO for blocking my best friend? Should I stay and help her out of this relationship?

**Some info about general health**

Don't smoke, drink beer, sedentary job, but try to walk at least two times a week for a few hours and generally good diet, drink few coffees a day, but have a bad sleep schedule, go to sleep late and get like 7hours max. I've had bad posture for years and sometimes have musculoskeletal pain around left and right pectoral and shoulder area, usually resolved by moving arms. I do queasy if I stand up quickly. I don't take any medications except calming gummies and D vitamin.

I was sick with COVID in 2020 for a month, got lung infection that was cured by antibiotics. Afterwards got tired easy, felt after effects in my lungs, but that went away after few months.

**So the heart skipping beats issue**

It started one evening after laying down. I did one of my 20 minute cardio workout on an elliptical earlier in the day, targeting 150BPM. I had same pectoral pain and noticed these once a minute sensations in center of my chest, tried to sense pulse on my neck and the heart beats were elevated and shallow, but interestingly once a minute there was a missing beat followed by a flurry of quick beats. I was stressed, but once I calmed down after an hour I fell asleep.

Morning I woke up all fine, so after week gave the elliptical one more go, but lowered heart BPM target just to be safe, but same thing in the evening.

I'm a generally anxious person, so i thought the pain was related to moving arms on an elliptical and skipping beats was just my anxiety and mix of caffeine. Same thing and this time lasted for a few days, but with lower occurrence. I tried calming gummies and it helped.

Problem is I've not been on an elliptical for some time and recently started having these randomly again, like few times an hour. They are rarer and generally happen in the second part of the day, but contributing factors are sitting with a bad posture, anxiety. Again, calming gummies, walking outside seem to help with the anxiety, but I'm worried if that's the real cause or just palpitations causing those skipped beats...

I (F19) started recently getting calf cramps when going asleep. Usually just the left leg, sometimes the right one too. Sometimes the pain kind of radiates into my thigh, knee or ankle, even the buttock. It's not a strong pain, moreso annoying. Kind of feels like a compression sock + muscle cramp. The pain eases when I stand up or walk, and I don't feel it at all during the day. Sometimes the pain also just switches legs for a moment. My mom checked my legs, and neither felt hot to the touch, swollen, bruised or hard in any way. I'm fairly certain it's muscle cramps as her checking kind of massaged my leg and eased the pain, but I have no idea why my muscles would cramp and I'm concerned nonetheless.

Now, I am on contraceptive pills (Slinda, which only has drospirenone, a progestin) which can increase the risk for blood clots. Before Slinda I've been on 4 different contraceptives at different times, which have either contained ethinylestradiol+dienogest, ethinylestradiol+drospirenone or ethinylestradiol+levonorgestrel in varying amounts. I have also not been able to be as physically active as I'd liked these past few months thanks to school - my school schedules overlap with my sports practices and basically all my waking hours are spent on schoolwork, if not eating, getting ready, taking care of my hygiene etc. I still walk to school daily (~15 min brisk walk, maybe 1,4 km, with some hills and stairs), always take the stairs instead of elevators and dance for at least a few minutes daily. I don't know if I'm genetically predisposed, as I haven't heard of any relatives getting blood clots but some have had many health problems, so it's possible. I'm not a smoker (though I used to date one and have friends who do, so sadly an unwilling passive smoker whenever standing further away isn't possible), not diabetic as far as I know of, possibly dehydrated as I definitely don't drink enough water and no past with cardiopulmonary or blood-related issues. I'm not obese, even according to the flawed BMI I'm in the healthy range. I mostly have healthy habits, I eat a lot of fresh vegetables and fruits and avoid heavily processed foods, preferring homecooked meals, but I do have a sweet tooth and use both alcohol and caffeine in moderation (0-3 cups of coffee or tea per day, 0-6 portions of alcohol per month). I am of legal drinking age where I live.

It's currently 2am and I can't sleep due to the anxiety surrounding this... Could anyone help? I know this sounds hypochondriac... I just got worried because the pain started radiating to my upper thigh and buttock for the first time and I got worried that it was a moving blood clot.

AIO?,"Hi. I'm confused on what to do and could really use some insight from an outsider's perspective.

I met this guy a while back. We worked at the same local coffee shop. We clicked immediately. I told him I was in a committed relationship and could only be friends, and he told me that was the best possible outcome because he's extremely gay and would rather die than be heterosexual.

I was like, okay! This is great! I was 19, new to the state (my husband and I moved across the country), and was delighted at the idea of being able to make new friends, especially if that friend is my coworker who I'd be seeing frequently. I don't work there anymore, career changed to a different field that's closer to my passion.

I truly feel like beside my husband, this guy is my ride or die. He makes being gay his entire personality, so I've never thought that maybe he's faking it until I sat down and really thought about it. I want to reiterate that he's like if RuPal and Ellen DeGeneres had a baby, but that baby was non-binary. He talks in a very stereotypical high-pitched, flamboyant, over the top voice, acts extremely feminine, wears rainbows everywhere he goes, and just acts like a proud, gay man.

Obviously, I'm fine with all of this. I'll always be an ally, and I'm walking right alongside him, even if I am straight. His actions never bothered me when it comes to his gay pride, and it doesn't now. I'm just...confused on the handsy part of being gay. The ONLY reason I'm saying it's included in being gay is because that's what HE always tells me, and I'm scared of being offensive to him or to the gay community, so that's another large reason I'm posting this because I know LGBTQ people will see it.

He's always touching me. And I mean always touching me. It's getting to the point where I don't want to be around him anymore. He's always taking the initiative to slap my ass, or grab my breasts, or hold my baby bump. The first time he groped me, I panicked and yelled at him. I have a history with sexual abuse, and I think he weaponized that against me, but I'm not sure. He got extremely offended. He told me ""that's just what girls do"" (he always refers to himself as a girl/woman/girlie/lady/whatever). He told me he understands I was abused in the past, but it's unfair to him if I take that out on him just trying to be friendly and act like how ""the girls"" are meant to.

I haven't told my husband yet. Every single time I try to, the words get stuck in my throat and I just can't. My husband trusts my best friend a lot, and they're also close, so I think a large part of me doesn't want to accuse anyone of anything and possibly ruin a friendship that my husband really appreciates.

I feel like I'm going insane. I see so many videos of women having gay best friends and they're all extremely no boundaries, so I feel like he's telling me the truth. I don't know if I really am projecting my trauma onto him or not.

What do you all think? His extreme handiness began about a month ago, and it happens every time we hang out, so I've started to ignore his messages or come up with excuses for why we can't hang out. AIO?

Sorry if this is all over the place. I'm extremely dyslexic and it gets worse when I'm upset. I'll explain anything better if I need to.

Thank you.

TL;DR: My gay best friend keeps touching me and when I get upset, he tells me it's just how the ""girls"" act and says I'm taking my trauma out on him. I don't know if this is true or not. I've started to distance myself from him because I'm unsure of how to proceed with him constantly touching me.",16,1769300583.0,AmIOverreacting,43,1.0,False
1qm3qy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1qm3qy3/guide_to_using_temperaturedependent_bed_meshes/,Guide to using temperature-dependent bed meshes,"I started using a temperature-dependent script since I had my Creality K1 (which has fairly significant warping issues depending on temperature). Having such a script is very useful when you print a range of materials from PLA to ABS.

Since I just gotten my Snapmaker U1, I decided to create a guide on how to do this script. This guide is written specifically from the perspective of the U1, but it should be easily adaptable to any klipper-based printer.

# Pre-Calibration Procedure

### Check probe accuracies
Since there are 4 print heads in the U1, it is very important to check that every print head is mechanically sound. I had issues with my second print head that gave wildly inconsistent reading, which I then managed to trace down to a loose print head.

* **Cean the nozzles:** Start by cleaning all 4 nozzles
* **Check probe accuracy:** Run the following script to check every print head:

```
    T0
    G0 X135 Y135 F9999
    PROBE_ACCURACY
    
    T1
    G0 X135 Y135 F9999
    PROBE_ACCURACY
    
    T2
    G0 X135 Y135 F9999
    PROBE_ACCURACY
    
    T3
    G0 X135 Y135 F9999
    PROBE_ACCURACY
```
You should see fairly consistent range and standard deviation across all 4 print heads like this:

```
probe accuracy results: maximum 0.063333, minimum 0.059167, range 0.004167, average 0.061417, median 0.061667, standard deviation 0.001057
probe accuracy results: maximum -0.028333, minimum -0.045833, range 0.017500, average -0.037667, median -0.042083, standard deviation 0.007386
probe accuracy results: maximum 0.015833, minimum 0.013333, range 0.002500, average 0.014667, median 0.014583, standard deviation 0.000764
probe accuracy results: maximum -0.028333, minimum -0.043333, range 0.015000, average -0.040917, median -0.042500, standard deviation 0.004289

```
If any print head gives poor results, remove and check if the print head is loose and make sure there is no debris on the print head.

**NOTE:** If you make any mechanical adjustment to any of the print heads, you **must** rerun the multi-toolhead calibration again as the relative z-offset of every toolhead is determined from there.

### Change bed mesh settings
The most important setting to add to the default is `zero_reference_position:`, which ensures that the bed zero zeference is aligned to the centre of the bed, which is used for all z-homing commands.

I also found that the default mesh of 13x13 is overkill, and I changed it to a 11x11 bed, which then also allows me to increase the number of `samples` to 9. For reference, this is my `bed_mesh` settings, which I also changed some of the defaults:

```
[bed_mesh]
speed: 200
move_accel: 5000
samples: 9
sample_retract_dist: 1.0
samples_tolerance: 0.03
zero_reference_position: 135, 135
lift_speed: 30
wait_before_setup: 0
wait_after_setup: 0
sample_retract_dist: 0.3
horizontal_move_z: 2
mesh_min: 3, 3
mesh_max: 267, 267
probe_count: 11, 11
split_delta_z: 0.01
mesh_pps: 2, 2
move_check_distance: 5
algorithm: bicubic
fast_horizontal_move_z: 0.5
first_raise_tool_gcode: SHAKE_Z
```

# Generate Bed Meshes

We will need to generate the temperature-dependent meshes. From my own testing, while the 60C and 70C beds are mildly affected by the head soak timing, the 80C and particularly the 90C beds requires a fairly substantial amount of head soak time to stabilise the bed. If you do not allow the bed to stabilise and start probing, the beds will continue to change shape while you probe which may result in an inaccurate mesh.

### Script for generating meshes
The script below incorporates some heat soak times, but feel to experiment on the settings. Simply copy and paste the script into the klipper console, run it, then go grab a coffee and wait.

In the U1, the meshes are not saved in `printer.cfg` like most klipper printers. Instead, they are saved as json files in the `snapmaker` folder inside the config folder. Every profile filename is prefixed by `bed_mesh_`. For example, the default bed mesh will be `bed_mesh_default.json` and the 60C mesh will be `bed_mesh_60C.json`.

This is also a good time to replace the default bed mesh to the temperature that you print most frequently in. If not, the default will be the 90C bed mesh (because that's the last bed mesh that you calibrated for). Simply delete the default bed mesh json file, and duplicate the temperature that you want as the new `bed_mesh_default.json`.


# Configuring the Printer to Use the New Meshes
We will need a add a new script to the printer and change the machine start gcode in order to use the new meshes:

### Add new script to the printer
If you are using the extended custom firmware, I highly recommend that you create a new `bed_mesh_select.cfg` in the `extended/klipper/` folder and paste the code below within. This will ensure that this script will not be overwritten when you flash new firmware. 

If you are using the standard firmware, then simply add code below into `fluidd.cfg`. 

```
[gcode_macro LOAD_TEMP_MESH]
description: Automatically load the closest mesh based on bed target temperature
gcode:
    {% set BED_TEMP = printer.heater_bed.target|int %}
    
    {% if BED_TEMP >= 55 and BED_TEMP < 65 %}
        { action_respond_info(""Bed Temp %dC: Loading 60C Mesh"" % BED_TEMP) }
        BED_MESH_PROFILE LOAD=""60C""
    {% elif BED_TEMP >= 65 and BED_TEMP < 75 %}
        { action_respond_info(""Bed Temp %dC: Loading 70C Mesh"" % BED_TEMP) }
        BED_MESH_PROFILE LOAD=""70C""
    {% elif BED_TEMP >= 75 and BED_TEMP < 85 %}
        { action_respond_info(""Bed Temp %dC: Loading 80C Mesh"" % BED_TEMP) }
        BED_MESH_PROFILE LOAD=""80C""
    {% elif BED_TEMP >= 85 %}
        { action_respond_info(""Bed Temp %dC: Loading 90C Mesh"" % BED_TEMP) }
        BED_MESH_PROFILE LOAD=""90C""
    {% else %}
        { action_respond_info(""Bed Temp %dC: No temperature-specific profile found, loading default"" % BED_TEMP) }
        BED_MESH_PROFILE LOAD=""default""
    {% endif %}
```
### Configure your start print macro
In Orca, go to your printer settings and find the section where `M190` is used in your machine start gcode section. Add `LOAD_TEMP_MESH` directly after this line. For the U1, it should look something like this:
```
;===== 精回零 =================

Enjoy your new temperature-dependent beds!!

**“The Orrery does not wait for pilgrims. It waits for balance.”**

Kirr in a moment of reflection

 

“All to the rest room. All to the rest room.” Loud, noisy.

‘All to the rest room. All to the rest room.’ Quiet, internal.

 

‘Is this a drill?’ asked Feebee.

‘No.’

‘An exercise?’

‘No’

‘How can I be sure?’

‘Good question. Trust me?’

 

Feebee laughed, ‘Could that be a test too?’

‘Fair,’ was all Kirr said.

 

But she thought on it. It was actually a valid point. *Did* *Feebee know the difference between the sims she’d been put through and reality?*

 

*What was her sense of reality? She’d spent more ‘time’ in sims than in the real. And had way more memories gained there than in the real.*

 

Kirr moved on. Had to. They had a situation in the real and needed Feebee.

‘Can you come to the Rest Area?’

‘Now?’

‘Yes.’

‘On my way.’

 

The route to the rest room took her past the armoury.

Peas sat at a bench. In front of her was an assault rifle, broken down. She was cleaning the parts. Seeing Feebee she jumped up and saluted.

‘Ma’am. Found a different rifle to clean.’

 

In the rest room, the two coffee boys sat alone. Their cups half empty, a third cup, full and some biscuits were on a plate in the middle. Bench press and Spotter in the corner, pressing weights and spotting.

 

She crossed to the coffee boys. “Whose is this?” she asked pointing to the full cup of coffee.

After what seemed like an age, one of the coffee boys answered, “It’s Sparky’s.”

“Did he make it?”

 

Another pause…

 

“No.”

 

Then someone Feebee didn’t recognise walked in. She immediately dropped into a low crouch, weapon drawn, intent clear.

“Identify yourself!”

“Sergeant Tiffany, Tiffy. Tech specialist, Engineering ma'am. Can I show you around?""

She shook her head. Déjà vu?

“No,” she said. Getting up and holstering her pistol. “I know my way around.”

“Of course.”

“Join us.”

They waited, then the door that led to the armoury whooshed open. Peas was always last to join.

 

“All present. Right. Who called the meeting?”

‘I did.’ It was Kirr.

 

An avatar appeared on the table between them. It was of a red headed female human, normal looking, maybe a bit thin, dressed in an androgynous JSOC uniform. The rank patches were obscured, as if not fully rendered. The eyes though were a light blue, almond shaped with visible creases above the eyelids. The outer corners of the eyes were elongated and up-turned. They reminded Feebee of cats, of pictures she remembered.

“I called it,” she spoke out loud. The voice was calm and authoritative.

 

‘When did you come up with that?’ Feebee asked.

‘Do you like it?’ The question conveyed hesitancy, something she’d never heard from Kirr before.

‘Oh. Ok, good. Well, it’s not for me to like or dislike it. If this is how you see yourself, it's fine.’

 

Then Kirr spoke to them all, “Hello. I am Kirr. We have a situation.”

 

They all looked to Feebee, she nodded. “Continue Kirr.”

 

Kirr spoke through her avatar that paced the table. “We have activation of many systems throughout the ship. North and South.”

The schematic of the ship appeared above her head, she pointed out the AMBER sections.

“This was our assessment of the ship’s health a couple of cycles ago. More than half the ship was AMBER, none GREEN, many RED.”

Feebee put her hand up, then quickly snapped it back down. “How are you catagorising the RAG status of the areas?”

“RED is less than 15% capability or operational function present. GREEN is a return to 85% operational capability. AMBER is in the middle, fifteen to eighty-five.”

“Looks bad. Two cycles ago?”  
“Yes.” Before Feebee could ask more, Kirr continued, “Now however.” She pointed to the schematic; it refreshed. “Almost all the RED’s gone. There’s more GREEN.”

“How?”

Kirr shrugged, “TBD.”

 

Feebee laughed, “You don’t know do you?”

“I don’t. We don’t.”

Feebee thought for a good minute. The more she thought the stronger the pull became. The ship was calling her.

 

The AI waited, it was literally an eon for it.

“I want to go and see. I have to.”

“That’s not a good idea.” Kirr's response was immediate.

“I’m going to see, with my own eyes.”  Feebee was adamant.

“Then you go alone.” The avatar looked to the others. They nodded.

“Oh, OK. Good. Alone it is.”

 

The EVA suit didn’t fit her anymore. She didn’t get upset. I’ll just print another.

‘Kirr, print me an EVA suit. Enough to get across and back with some redundancy.’

‘Ack. Go to the macro-forge at J.02.14.’

 

The route took her past the armoury. She ducked in.

*Hhmm, where was Peas?*

The bench was empty too. No rifle. Crossed to weapons rack. She put a knife and spare ammo, green and blue, in her backpack. She holstered the pistol at her hip, a clip of blue inserted.

 

She turned to leave. Peas was there, at her desk. Feebee never heard her appear.

She snapped to attention, “Ma’am”

“Do they need cleaning?” she asked pointing to the Ruger Mini-14 in Peas hands.

“They gather dust.”

Feebee smiled, “Bye.”

“Bye Ma’am.”

 

She followed the directions in her overlays. J.02.14 turned out to be a medium sized room on the edge of the SSOCOM area. The macro-forge was in one corner near a stack of feedstock bricks.

 

Feebee could hear chatter from the loader droid. ‘Hi there.’

The droid turned towards her unsure why. It’s limited AI had no protocols beyond the two things it did and did very well.

Collect feedstock when levels got low. Load feedstock when asked to.

It felt pride in its job. Had never failed a load or run empty. All reports on time.

 

There was the characteristic “Ping” as the print finished. Feebee reached across the print plate and took the EVA suit. She lay down her backpack and shucked the suit on.

*It fitted like a glove*. She laughed at the thought. *The gloves fitted like gloves, the suit fitted like a … well, like an EVA suit.*

There was an echo of laughter from Kirr, just a few scratchy tones.

She checked the suit.

POWER: 100%

AIR: 100%

WATER: 100%

INTERNAL TEMP: 37oC

FOOD: 0%

‘Any Choc?’

‘Just water.’ More scratchy laughter.

 

‘Where’s the nearest point of egress South, from here? Show me.’

 

She followed her overlay to an airlock. She could see across to the main ship. Twenty or thirty paces. In the real. Space.

Her heart started to pound. Deep breaths.

 

She started to hum; words formed in her head. *Whisper, whisper…*

 

Stillness returned.

Balance restored.

 

Feebee stepped into the airlock, the door shut behind her. The air was sucked out as it equalised.

 

**The Beast stirred** and reached across time and into her real, her realm. It took effort, lots of effort given the load on its current resources. It had to reduce the priority on some key queries, push them onto its backlog. Humour kept cropping up and was a key to understanding. The Beast was sure about this. It mattered.

 

The Universe groaned.

The Beast heard and was more confused.

 

 

The outer door started to open, the barest crack.

 

Then stopped.

Before Feebee could do anything her suit failed. Not slowly like a power drain but here one second, then gone. No warning, no alarms, no countdown.

A complete failure.

 

She reached across and pressed the green button to close the outer door.

 

Nothing.

She pressed it again.

 

Nothing.

 

No panic. A quiet assessment. Critical thinking.

 

I cannot leave by the outer door.

I cannot close the outer door.

The inner door will not open with the outer door open.

My comms needs power.

My suit has no power.

I cannot access power.

I cannot access more air without power.

My only air is in my suit now.

No power also means no nano-forge.

I have minutes.

Others may come.

 

*If I panic, I die faster. Or I can do nothing and maybe live.*

 

She sat, cross legged. Her fists relaxed as she recited words from Ancient Memory. They were from the Litany to Veltrin and came as Drexari words, all clicks and guttural tones.

 

Slow, breathe.

Hold fast. Be still.

Let this moment be me.

 

I am the peace within the storm.

I am stillness,

The quiet between waves.

 

Waste nothing.

Balance holds me.

Quiet keeps me.

 

 

A green shadow was cast onto the wall of the airlock. Green is good. Was the door closing?

She turned her head. No, it was still open.

 

Slow, breathe.

Hold fast. Be still.

Let this moment be me…

She’s such a difficult person to like. And it could be why this page was started in the first place she herself seems very snarky and very judgmental. 

While I wouldn’t enjoy the snark of a genuine person this doesn’t seem like a genuine person at all. Matter of fact the only reason I found this page was, I was trying to get more data on who this person even is outside of being somebody’s wife and disliking making coffee in the early morning. 

And absolutely all of the data I’ve given prior to what I’m saying now is not enough to think somebody is snarky, but then you hear her attitude. If she was a coffee, her primary add-on would be attitude, 4 pumps no skimping. 

For somebody who seems so rich so privileged so important can’t you have a bit of humility. 

You are privileged beyond your wildest dreams and you still act like a unsatisfied snark. Bitching about low ice in a time like this, ok sugar plum.

I’ll come back to this page when she has a baby and then we can really have a conversation of how maybe some of this is good judgment of character. Good Luck Charlie! ",1,1769300313.0,darcymcqueeny,0,0.67,False
1qm3oyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/snapmaker/comments/1qm3oyy/guide_to_using_temperaturedependent_bed_meshes/,Guide to using temperature-dependent bed meshes,"I started using a temperature-dependent script since I had my Creality K1 (which has fairly significant warping issues depending on temperature). Having such a script is very useful when you print a range of materials from PLA to ABS.

Since I just gotten my Snapmaker U1, I decided to create a guide on how to do this script. This guide is written specifically from the perspective of the U1, but it should be easily adaptable to any klipper-based printer.

# Pre-Calibration Procedure

### Check probe accuracies
Since there are 4 print heads in the U1, it is very important to check that every print head is mechanically sound. I had issues with my second print head that gave wildly inconsistent reading, which I then managed to trace down to a loose print head.

* **Cean the nozzles:** Start by cleaning all 4 nozzles
* **Check probe accuracy:** Run the following script to check every print head:

```
    T0
    G0 X135 Y135 F9999
    PROBE_ACCURACY
    
    T1
    G0 X135 Y135 F9999
    PROBE_ACCURACY
    
    T2
    G0 X135 Y135 F9999
    PROBE_ACCURACY
    
    T3
    G0 X135 Y135 F9999
    PROBE_ACCURACY
```
You should see fairly consistent range and standard deviation across all 4 print heads like this:

```
probe accuracy results: maximum 0.063333, minimum 0.059167, range 0.004167, average 0.061417, median 0.061667, standard deviation 0.001057
probe accuracy results: maximum -0.028333, minimum -0.045833, range 0.017500, average -0.037667, median -0.042083, standard deviation 0.007386
probe accuracy results: maximum 0.015833, minimum 0.013333, range 0.002500, average 0.014667, median 0.014583, standard deviation 0.000764
probe accuracy results: maximum -0.028333, minimum -0.043333, range 0.015000, average -0.040917, median -0.042500, standard deviation 0.004289

```
If any print head gives poor results, remove and check if the print head is loose and make sure there is no debris on the print head.

**NOTE:** If you make any mechanical adjustment to any of the print heads, you **must** rerun the multi-toolhead calibration again as the relative z-offset of every toolhead is determined from there.

### Change bed mesh settings
The most important setting to add to the default is `zero_reference_position:`, which ensures that the bed zero zeference is aligned to the centre of the bed, which is used for all z-homing commands.

I also found that the default mesh of 13x13 is overkill, and I changed it to a 11x11 bed, which then also allows me to increase the number of `samples` to 9. For reference, this is my `bed_mesh` settings, which I also changed some of the defaults:

```
[bed_mesh]
speed: 200
move_accel: 5000
samples: 9
sample_retract_dist: 1.0
samples_tolerance: 0.03
zero_reference_position: 135, 135
lift_speed: 30
wait_before_setup: 0
wait_after_setup: 0
sample_retract_dist: 0.3
horizontal_move_z: 2
mesh_min: 3, 3
mesh_max: 267, 267
probe_count: 11, 11
split_delta_z: 0.01
mesh_pps: 2, 2
move_check_distance: 5
algorithm: bicubic
fast_horizontal_move_z: 0.5
first_raise_tool_gcode: SHAKE_Z
```

# Generate Bed Meshes

We will need to generate the temperature-dependent meshes. From my own testing, while the 60C and 70C beds are mildly affected by the head soak timing, the 80C and particularly the 90C beds requires a fairly substantial amount of head soak time to stabilise the bed. If you do not allow the bed to stabilise and start probing, the beds will continue to change shape while you probe which may result in an inaccurate mesh.

### Script for generating meshes
The script below incorporates some heat soak times, but feel to experiment on the settings. Simply copy and paste the script into the klipper console, run it, then go grab a coffee and wait.

```

SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=extruder TARGET=140

BED_MESH_PROFILE SAVE=90C

SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=extruder TARGET=0
SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=0

```
### Where to find the bed meshes
In the U1, the meshes are not saved in `printer.cfg` like most klipper printers. Instead, they are saved as json files in the `snapmaker` folder inside the config folder. Every profile filename is prefixed by `bed_mesh_`. For example, the default bed mesh will be `bed_mesh_default.json` and the 60C mesh will be `bed_mesh_60C.json`.

This is also a good time to replace the default bed mesh to the temperature that you print most frequently in. If not, the default will be the 90C bed mesh (because that's the last bed mesh that you calibrated for). Simply delete the default bed mesh json file, and duplicate the temperature that you want as the new `bed_mesh_default.json`.

He was the first one to message me, and soon after that we met in person. We lived in the same building. Our first meeting was very fun. I was 21 years old and before that I had never even kissed anyone, so I had no experience at all. After that, we saw each other once more that week, and I remember texting my friends that I had a nice time again. I didn’t think too much about everything, and then I went home for two weeks (I was living in the city where I was studying).

During that time, I started texting with a guy from my university, and through messages I found it more interesting. During those two weeks, I actually liked that guy from university more than my current boyfriend. I was texting both of them. When I returned to the city where I was studying, my current boyfriend briefly came to see me. I remember thinking at that moment that I liked him, but the next day I was supposed to go for coffee with the guy I had been texting.

That coffee didn’t go well. The moment I saw him approaching me in person, I knew I didn’t like him. He was shorter — or rather, he was the same height as me, 165 cm — which I didn’t find attractive. When I returned to my apartment, I immediately called my current boyfriend and we spent time together. That same day, I cut off contact with the other guy. And already the next day, when I saw my current boyfriend again, I was sure that I officially liked him.

Should I feel guilty for going for that coffee? It’s really haunting me now. I keep thinking about it all the time and it affects me. I feel like I can’t live in the present. I feel as if that part of the story will haunt me forever.

I don’t know what is wrong with me. I keep ruminating about this and some other stuff for a year and a half now. It keeps coming back in phases. I realised when it’s not this then it’s something else but I forget about the first thing. And then that thing seems like worst.

Finished now. Damn, things have really gotten interesting. Seems Lewis slipped away, and told Anthony what's up. I was also right about the Belle thing being related to Lewis knowing they're rebelling, so that's something. Pretty impressive the Belles figured things out and asked for their team to help them. Everyone on their team is i think in the Kate faction either way. The teamwork gave Anthony quite some info, it's unfortunate he slipped away though. 

Damn, i'm just wondering how much potential the plot could've had. There's so many tropes, first of all what could've happened if the Benjamin team was able to catch and restrain Anthony? What would've happened if Kate would've told joseph about the rebellion (but not the kate faction) right away they stopped Lewis? What would've happened if both of those things occured

Well, the former.. Anthony being restrained by the Kate faction, with right coordination could mean a cancellation of plan of restraining Lewis due to that raising suspicioun. Kate could've potentially brainwashed Christopher into believing he was abducted by the adults, but that may not be the case if Anthony foresaw Kate's betrayal from a long ago and shared it with Christopher v2. I feel like Lewis and Christopher being brainwashed by that kind of thing is unlikely, but not impossible

The whole meeting of the star bearers betrayal was announced instantly after lewis came back or so i assume. It's unlikely they foresaw this happen already after Benjamin team's act and prepared this beforehand when the star bearers left to come in contact with Lewis

So Lewis getting captured would've led to an opening to capture Christopher aswell. It's likely he wouldn't make a move early on even if he wouldnt be brainwashed by Kate into believing Anthony was abducted by the adults. 

Lmao, that is funny. Anthony's team being forced into hiding and Kate acting under the guise of replacing anthony and christopher while they're away while in reality acting in the background to unbrainwash all them and eventually tell them the truth

That is such a perfect plan so that was probably why it wasn't made that easy.

Afterall, Anthony declaring star bearers enemies means they'd be unable to take refuge in the childrens wing and the people on the kate faction would be hunted down and making a move for them would be hard

And the worst part, telling the children the truth, and that Joseph is on their side (Unless he's deceiving them, which i deem unlikely. His story is quite believable) would blow his cover and highly alert the adults. But damn, not even the adults know of Christopher's rebellion.. Outside Lewis and Joseph

""Blinded by peace"" made me curious about this specific chapter. But i never could've guessed the meaning. Afterall, the meaning of it is that the adults trusted the coffee so much they became oblivious of everything happening in the children's wing. It's about to turn into a warzone now..

Well.. that being said, wouldn't revealing Joseph is on their side only give anthony more evidence to snitch to the big guys on them. I know that Anthony practically declared war against the Kate's faction, and everyone else is likely brainwashed, but the real mess is gonna begin when the adult building consisting of people following TGG actually gets itself involved. Especially those 3rd floor shadows

So what else choice do they have? Sneak Kate and others into the children building without crossing the hall of glory, and work from the shadows in order to convert everyone else to Kate's faction? Well.. that seems likely, i guess

Without Kate, it'll just be Anthony solidyfing that complete control even further, which isn't good. He can also just make everyone drink the coffee and make sure they do which will fish out some people unless someone takes temporary control until Kate's back and tells them to just unbrainwash their living dolls later on. 

Besides.. Maryrose and Gilbert - it's very likely they're still under Anthony's influence. Maryrose dissappearing could've been a move against Kate in the future, so that she won't make her comeback

Maryrose did know Kate had no choice but to search for the culprit, but if she really wanted to Ally herself with her, she could practically do the same thing as she actually did, by falling and most likely using the left up soot after destroying the bridge to also summon a ghost

But then again, sure, figuring out who she is is a big deal but i wouldn't say it's worthy to change your whole plan over and ally yourself with her. So it's really not certain Maryrose is still on Anthony's side. I wanna believe she's on Kate's side and will be brought back later but i just doubt that can be the case

And right now the star bearers only way to getting back inside the children's building is i think flying and shit like Kate did when she escaped Edward during anime-only abduction arc. But how will everyone else get across?.. 

Well, maybe they can sneak out and use the mountains around it. It's time for Kate to live in the shadows, i suppose

Also, i guess the special morphs were really a thing now. We were only told the morph had memories before they imitated a human being at first, but ""special morphs"" actually take over bodies and shit. That's so cool. Afterall, Kate used to have a face

That also increases their lifespan and shit which is cool. Also if Edward isn't a special morph  he probably had absolutely zero way of promotion. That means he's been trying to achieve the impossible the entire time LMAO that is hilarious

That being said though.. Special morphed people still do the unification ritual. It'd be weird not to, how'd they get into the children building? I feel like there are 2 scenarios

1) There's a way to determine if a certain person is a special morph, in which case, a unification method is not needed and they are simply given the fragments of favor and the doll disposed of

2) The unification ritual still proceeds as usual

It's most likely 2), 1 seems far more complicated and risky. But either way, if that is true that means Joseph is initially a half-human, since the morph took him over, but him being a special morph helps him retain more humanity. If he went through the unification ritual aswell, that would mean he's technically 2/3 human and 1/3 shadow, if that makes sense

That being said though.. we aren't exactly aware of how much humanity the special morph-takeovered shadows retain. Uncertain it's 50/50, infact, i'd bet the morph has more dominance since Kate's face was only seen at her early years, and after that she's only been a shadow so far

I wonder if when we get to see Kate's human face, it'll be very similar to Emilyko's. Eh, that is most likely bullshit. Though, i forgot if we've seen Kate's real face back when she was living with Emily. I should check back on that now! 

Oh wow, her face was intentionally hidden. We've only seen her face back when she was a baby, but it doesn't really matter. It's a neat little detail, intentionally hiding her face like that in few frames until she had a shadow-like appearance

Anyway, getting through to brainwashed children will sure be hard.. I wonder how it'll play out after? Joseph's reaction was also a bit hasty when he found shit out which is a slight red flag but i mean, what is there to not panic about if you're on Kate's side anyway? Lewis is about to tell anthony a bunch of shit

It'd be a really cool dynamic if Joseph betrays Kate though. Announce her loyal to the shadows house and ally with upper floor shadows to calm things down, and then... uh.. have fun explaining to children why the fuck did you just do that

... So yeah, that probably isn't happening. Joseph doesn't seem to have any allies in the adult building so it's likely Kate's faction just battles it out with Anthony's faction and that is it

Either way. Peak. This created far more thoughts than i thought it would. ""thoughts"" and""thought"" also sounds like a SH-like pun, there was one during those 4 chapters aswell. The ""Quite a relief"" when referring to the relief team. I love seeing Emi laugh at those silly puns too :)

Chapter 224 : 9/10

Chapter 225 : 9.2/10

Chapter 226 : 9.4/10

Oh wow, never expected Maryrose to reside in coal mine of all things. I'm still in disbelief Edward was able to come into an agreement with her and not fight despite still standing by the loyalty to TGG 

Also, seems she realised Anthony isn't quite the good guy because she found out he killed Alfred, it's pretty cool that she'll join up with Kate. 

Damn, fragments of favor really are the shit aren't they? Aswell as maryrose's OP soot power. To be able to defeat 3 adults at the same time that easily? That's insane. Those guys do seem weak asf compared to her lol

It wasn't even a fight at this point. Just Maryrose showing off and using Edward for her own goals

But damn, was Edward really able to change? I kind of doubt that NGL

Either way, happy Maryrose is back. I've missed her, that entire master robe arc was peak asf. I wonder if Anthony was able to foresee she won't side him anymore? Probably.. He did say he wouldn't need her in the past, so

I wonder what King being the manager of the CB will do with anything. He's probably holding a grudge at them ever since the star bearers embarrassed the shit out of him 

I guess they'll have no choice but to threaten him with shit and use him as a pawn to somehow deal with Anthony

That being said.. How? Majority of the children there are brainwashed, star bearers and like.. no one is allowed inside the children's wing and kate's faction members may have a hard time surviving. Perhaps Kate will reside with Joseph until Maryrose comes back and then she helps her enter the children's building? After that they'll hold a meeting and attempt to make the childrens wing realise Anthony is a bad guy

As long as they're open to reasoning, that wouldn't be an issue tbh. Just have jeremy make quickly working unbrainwashing salt or whatever or make them drink water. Drinking water is for sure harmless so they wouldn't mind it, and the salt wouldn't be an issue either if Jeremy tries it on himself as to showcase. 

But will they reason??

When Maryrose comes back and joins Kate, they may gain an immensely powerful ally, but Anthony still has access to fragments on favor and can basically send children on suicide missions. And Kate would somehow need to prevent that because Margaret 2.0 wouldn't be cool in the slightest, even with Maryrose's help. 

The children's wing really may become a warzone at this point.. 

Well, hopefully Kate is somehow able to prevent that and survive/gain allies at the same time. 

Chapter 227 : 9.4/10  
Chapter 228 : 8.7/10  
Chapter 229 : 9.4/10

(ch227) Lol, looks like King wasn't nearly as annoying as i thought he'd be. I suppose it was a good call making him the manager. Unexpected encounter with Sara and Mia, though.

Really, for the most part i'm now wondering how will Edward react when he sees that the person he hates the most, Kate, and their star bearers have taken over his and his peers room. Ontop of that, coincidentally Kate was exactly the one who took over HIS room. That's just too funny for me i can't really help it

Also hopefully Kate will get to meet with Maryrose soon. Surely they'll be allies this time 

Okay, finished. Mia sure had it rough.. To think she accidentally killed her family, then convinced her it was intentional.. 

And now she has her sister's name. Sarah and Mia's relationship also somewhat reflects Sarah and Mia's relationship back in the village. Except Sarah isn't that hardworking compared to Sarah from the village, but ultimately it still sort of reflects their relationships

Also, to hit Emilyko like that. Screw her. Well, i still want to see her on Kate's side, though.. She had a tragic past and i believe she deserves redemption. After all, Emilyko's influence won over both the Belles and Barbara, who all hit her in the past. 

I wonder what it is Joseph has to talk about. Probably something regarding Anthony or Maryrose. We still don't know what decision did TGG make. If he didn't listen to Joseph, that would surely fasten up the story.. which i hope doesn't happen. I want this arc to be long long and juicy!! 

Could be that he got news about Edward and Maryrose coming back. Quite unsure what'd happen to Maryrose though, but with her powers, surely she finds her way out of whatever she has to face

It seems my theory about Maryrose and the star bearers sneaking into the childrens building was wrong atleast for now, because, well, they're residing in the adults building and it would be suspicious for them to dissappear. 

Anthony isn't defenseless either because of fragments of favor. The worst thing is if the adults attack the childrens wing and Anthony forces people from the kates faction to take FOF and go on a suicide charge. Besides, damn, that guy's malicious af. Chasing out the star bearers like that knowing full well they can snitch to the adults and putting the responsiblity on Kate to prevent her since she knows he'll sacrifice children and make them take FOF one by one in order to fight back

Well, time to pray worst case scenario doesn't happen as i wait for more translations. It's kind of funny that the chapter released just about today at night giving me one more chapter to read through and the translations likely continuing given the translation team finally found a new translator. That just as i catch up to the story, lol. Also i likely won't be taking look at untranslated chapters and summaries and stuff, i wanna go through them myself once they're translated. 

Anyway, that's probably the last part, since there's no more translated content. I'll likely just comment on posts whenever a chapter was translated as that's more convinient. This is just so peak! Can't wait for the next chapter!",4,1769300098.0,ShadowsHouse,0,1.0,False

Should be able to get us 36 runs and hopefully come out with \~100k+ after all is said and done. (Assuming your fishing level/skill is high enough to catch 3k worth per run. May vary by person.) So a net profit of \~80k+ after your boat costs. 

Anyone joining will be committing to purchasing the boat runs when it's their turn in the rotation.

Hey Maximizers! 👋

Ever feel like you're just going through the motions, or that ""ultimate life"" thing is a distant dream? I've been there. It's easy to get caught up in the daily grind and forget that building a life you absolutely love is actually within reach. And guess what? It doesn't require a magic wand or a massive overhaul. It's all about those small, intentional shifts.

Let's talk about unlocking that next level of joy and success.

**Tiny Habits, Big Impact:**

Think about it – those little daily actions you take, good or bad, compound over time.

*   **Morning Ritual Refresh:** Instead of hitting snooze a dozen times, try just one. Or even better, get up and immediately do something small that fuels you. A few minutes of stretching, a quick journal entry, or just stepping outside for some fresh air can completely shift your morning energy.
*   **Mindful Moments:** We're constantly bombarded. Deliberately carving out just 60 seconds to focus on your breath, notice your surroundings, or acknowledge a feeling can be incredibly grounding. It’s a mini-reset button for your brain.
*   **Gratitude Practice, Simplified:** Forget writing essays. Just think of one thing, *one* thing, you're genuinely grateful for each day. It could be the taste of your coffee, a funny meme you saw, or a supportive text. This simple act rewires your brain to see the good.

**Fueling Your Inner Fire:**

Success isn't just about what you achieve, but how you *feel* along the way.

*   **Celebrate Small Wins:** Did you finally tackle that task you’ve been dreading? Awesome! Pat yourself on the back. Seriously. Acknowledging these small victories builds momentum and proves to yourself that you're capable.
*   **Curiosity Over Judgment:** When something doesn't go as planned, instead of beating yourself up, try a little curiosity. ""Hmm, what can I learn from this?"" or ""What if I tried this differently next time?"" This shifts your perspective from failure to learning.
*   **Nourish Your Well-being:** This is non-negotiable. It doesn't have to be a perfect diet or an hour at the gym every day. It's about making *better* choices, more often. Hydration, movement, and getting enough sleep are foundational to feeling your best.

Sometimes, navigating these inner shifts can feel overwhelming, and that’s perfectly normal. If you’re finding it tough to manage your emotions or build these positive habits, remember that support is available.

I am a 28 year old guy living in Germany, hoping to meet someone I can genuinely connect with, whether that starts online or leads somewhere more.

A bit about me:  

I am into anime, series, and video games, and I like balancing that with real life things like hiking, going to the gym, and reading. I am also a big language nerd. I currently speak five languages and I am learning my sixth one right now, so if you like languages or different cultures, we will probably get along well.

I am a big cat and coffee lover. I enjoy conversations about almost anything, from deep talks to random everyday topics.

To be upfront, I have never been in an official relationship before. I was in a situationship where I thought we were building something real until she left after meeting someone in real life. It was a learning experience. I just prefer to be honest about where I am coming from.

1qm3jue,https://www.reddit.com/r/eonhealth/comments/1qm3jue/bpc157_does_it_actually_affect_blood_pressure/,BPC-157: Does It Actually Affect Blood Pressure?,"Most BPC-157 discussions focus on tissue repair and healing.   
  
But animal research consistently shows something else:   
  
**BPC-157 has significant effects on blood pressure through the nitric oxide system.** If you're someone dealing with hypertension, could this peptide offer benefits beyond injury healing? Or conversely, if you're hypotensive, should you be concerned about it dropping your pressure further?  
  
**I. The Common Belief**  
  
The mainstream narrative around BPC-157 centers almost exclusively on:  
\- Tendon and ligament healing  
\- Gut repair and IBD  
\- General tissue regeneration  
  
Blood pressure effects, if mentioned at all, appear as a footnote - ""may affect blood pressure"" with no real exploration.   
  
Even the biohacking community largely treats cardiovascular effects as a minor side effect rather than a potential primary mechanism of interest.  
  
**II. What the Evidence Actually Shows**  
  
**1. The Core Mechanism: Nitric Oxide Modulation**  
  
BPC-157 isn't simply a blood pressure reducer or raiser - it appears to be a **normalizer** that works through multiple mechanisms \[T1\].  
  
**The Src-Caveolin-1-eNOS Pathway** (PMID: 33051481)  
  
A 2020 study in *Scientific Reports* demonstrated the precise molecular mechanism:  
  
1. BPC-157 activates Src kinase (phosphorylation peaks at 30-60 min)  
2. This leads to Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) phosphorylation  
3. Cav-1 normally inhibits eNOS - BPC-157 **reduces Cav-1-eNOS binding to 50%** of baseline  
4. Released eNOS generates nitric oxide  
5. NO causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation  
  
Critically, when the endothelium was removed, vasorelaxation dropped to just 19% even at the highest dose - confirming this is primarily an **endothelium-dependent effect**, not direct smooth muscle action.  
  
When eNOS was blocked with L-NAME or NO was scavenged with hemoglobin, vasorelaxation at 100 μg/ml dropped from 37.6% to \~10-12% \[T1\].  
  
**2. The Bidirectional Effect**  
  
This is where BPC-157 gets genuinely interesting for blood pressure:  
  
**- Counteracts L-NAME-induced hypertension** (PMID: 9298922):  
\- L-NAME blocks nitric oxide synthase, raising blood pressure  
\- BPC-157 given prophylactically **prevented** the blood pressure increase  
\- BPC-157 given after blood pressure was already elevated **reduced** it back down  
  
**- Counteracts L-arginine-induced hypotension:**   
\- L-arginine is an NO precursor that lowers blood pressure  
\- BPC-157 pretreatment **prevented** this drop  
  
**- The critical finding**: BPC-157 by itself does not affect basal normal blood pressure values \[T1\]. It only acts when pressure is disturbed.  
  
This suggests BPC-157 isn't simply ""lowering"" or ""raising"" blood pressure - it's modulating the NO system toward homeostasis.  


**3. Specific Hypertension Models**  
  
**- Salt-Induced Hypertension** (FASEB 2019):  
`In rats fed a 30% salt diet for one month, control animals developed hypertension (132-150 mmHg mean arterial pressure) with compromised optic disc circulation. BPC-157-treated rats showed:`  
`- Preserved optic disc head circulation`  
`- Normalized arterial/vein diameter ratios (~3:4, physiological)`  
`- Better choroidal blood flow [T1]`  
  
**- Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension** (PMID: 34356886):  
In the monocrotaline rat model (which damages pulmonary endothelium):  
  
`Prevention regimen (started Day 1):`  
`- Pulmonary hypertension did not develop`  
`- Right ventricle weight: 0.15-0.18g vs 0.32g in controls`  
`- Pulmonary artery wall thickness: 19-21% vs 42% in controls`  
`- QT interval: 45-49ms vs 78ms in controls`  
`- 0% mortality vs 50% in controls`  
  
`Reversal regimen (started Day 14, after disease established):`  
`- Deterioration halted within one week`  
`- Right ventricle hypertrophy reversed from 0.53 to 0.29-0.34 within two weeks`  
`- Media wall thickness normalized from 41-43% to 22-28% [T1]`  
  
**- Hyperkalemia-Induced Arrhythmias** (PMID: 23327997):  
`- Potassium overdose (>12 mmol/L) normally causes fatal arrhythmias within 30 min`  
`- BPC-157 provided complete counteraction: regained sinus rhythm, less QRS prolongation, no asystolic pause`  
`- All BPC-157 regimens achieved this effect`  
`- The researchers described it as having ""huge life-saving potential"" [T1]`  
  
**4. The L-NAME Paradox**  
  
Here's something unusual: BPC-157 generates nitric oxide at levels comparable to L-arginine. But when L-NAME (an NOS inhibitor) was applied at 10x the dose needed to block L-arginine's effects, **it could not block BPC-157's effects** \[T1\].  
  
This suggests BPC-157 works through additional pathways beyond classical NO generation - possibly:  
\- Alternative NO-generating mechanisms  
\- Direct effects on the VEGFR2-Akt-eNOS pathway  
\- Interactions with dopaminergic and adrenergic systems (documented but mechanism unclear)  
  
**5. What About Goldblatt Hypertension?**  
  
Early research (Sikiric et al., 1993) noted effects on Goldblatt's hypertension (a renovascular model), though ""the mechanism remains elusive."" This was attributed to ""complex interaction with adrenergic and dopaminergic systems"" \[T2\].  
  
**6. Counter Evidence / Limitations**  
  
**a) No human data specifically on blood pressure**:  
\- Zero controlled trials measuring BP as primary outcome  
\- The 2025 IV safety pilot (n=2) showed ""no measurable effects on vital signs"" - but this was a brief infusion in healthy subjects, not hypertensive patients \[T1\]  
  
**b) Concentration concerns**:  
\- Therapeutic dosing (10 μg/kg/day) produces estimated blood concentrations below 1 μg/ml  
\- The vasorelaxation studies showed minimal effect (<20%) at these concentrations  
\- Higher concentrations (48% vasorelaxation at 100 μg/ml) may not be achievable therapeutically \[T1\]  
  
**c) Single research group**:  
\- Nearly all cardiovascular BPC-157 research comes from Dr. Predrag Sikiric's lab at University of Zagreb  
\- Independent replication is lacking  
\- This is a significant concern for scientific credibility  
  
**d) Animal-only data**:  
\- All blood pressure studies are in rats  
\- Human physiology may differ  
\- Doses are extrapolated, not validated in humans  
  
**7, Community Reports \[T3-T4\]**  
  
Reddit and forum reports on BPC-157 and blood pressure are surprisingly sparse. Most users focus on tissue healing.  
  
What exists:  
\- Some users report **dizziness** or **lightheadedness**, which could indicate BP changes \[T4\]  
\- Reports of **fatigue** early in use, potentially from BP fluctuation adjustment \[T4\]  
\- One aggregated review notes that ""a few users experience lightheadedness or mild blood pressure fluctuations"" \[T3\]  
  
Notably **absent**: Specific reports of users with hypertension seeing meaningful BP reductions, or hypotensive users having problems. This could mean:  
1. The effect isn't clinically meaningful in humans at typical doses  
2. Users aren't measuring/tracking BP  
3. The effect is subtle enough to go unnoticed  
  
**IV. The Verdict**  
  
**- Evidence level**: Strong T1 animal evidence for mechanism; zero T1 human evidence for clinical effect.  
  
**- What we can say**:  
1. BPC-157 definitively affects vascular tone through the Src-Cav-1-eNOS pathway in animals  
2. It has a **normalizing** rather than directional effect on blood pressure  
3. Effects are primarily endothelium-dependent  
4. At therapeutic concentrations, the vasorelaxation effect may be modest (16-20%)  
5. The pulmonary hypertension prevention/reversal data is genuinely impressive  
  
**- What we cannot say**:  
1. Whether this translates to humans  
2. What dose would be needed for meaningful BP effects  
3. Whether chronic use maintains or diminishes the effect  
4. Safety in people with existing cardiovascular conditions  
  
**- The honest take**: If you have hypertension and are considering BPC-157 specifically for BP management, you're operating without any human evidence. The animal data is mechanistically interesting but not clinically validated. Standard antihypertensives have decades of human outcome data; BPC-157 has none.  
  
If you're already using BPC-157 for healing and happen to have hypertension, the theoretical effect is likely neutral-to-beneficial, but monitoring is essential.  
  
**V. Personalization**  
  
**1. How to Track if BPC-157 Affects YOUR Blood Pressure**  
  
**Equipment needed**:  
`- Home BP monitor (automatic cuff recommended for consistency)`  
`- HRV-capable wearable (Oura, Apple Watch, Garmin, etc.)`  
  
**Protocol**:  
  
**Baseline (2 weeks minimum)**:  
`- Measure BP same time daily (morning, before coffee/food recommended)`  
`- Record: systolic, diastolic, heart rate`  
`- Track HRV trends from wearable`  
`- Note any symptomatic episodes (dizziness, lightheadedness)`  
  
**Intervention (4-6 weeks)**:  
`- Begin BPC-157 at chosen dose`  
`- Continue exact same measurement protocol`  
`- Add: timing of dose relative to BP measurement`  
  
**What to look for**:  
`- Change in average systolic/diastolic from baseline`  
`- Change in BP variability (standard deviation)`  
`- HRV changes (theoretically could increase if NO-mediated vasodilation improves cardiovascular flexibility)`  
`- Any symptomatic episodes`  
  
**Success criteria for ""BPC-157 affects my BP""**:  
`- Consistent >5 mmHg change from baseline mean`  
`- Direction of change (up or down depending on your starting point)`  
`- No concerning symptoms`  
  
**Red flags to stop and consult physician**:  
`- Systolic drops below 90 or rises above 160`  
`- Symptomatic hypotension (dizziness, fainting)`  
`- New onset palpitations or arrhythmia symptoms`  
`- Any concerning symptoms`  
  
**2. For Those With Existing Hypertension**  
  
If you're on antihypertensive medications:  
1. **Do not** stop or adjust medications based on BPC-157 use  
2. Track BP more frequently initially (twice daily)  
3. If consistent reductions occur, consult your physician about medication adjustment - don't self-adjust  
4. Be aware that theoretical interactions with NO-affecting medications (like nitrates) could exist  
  
**3. For Those With Low Blood Pressure**  
  
The animal data suggests BPC-157 should not worsen hypotension (it prevented L-arginine-induced hypotension). However:  
1. Track BP before starting  
2. Be alert for any worsening of orthostatic symptoms  
3. Consider starting at lower doses

I’m looking for some advice on the best way to exit a micro-project I launched about 10 days ago.

**The Project:** [zoneless.tools](https://zoneless.tools) — a minimalist timezone planner for global remote teams.

**The Story:** I built it in 3 days and launched it on Jan 14. It immediately caught fire on Reddit and was scouted by a curator, leading to a ""Tool of the Day"" feature in the **Morning Brew** newsletter (4M+ subscribers) on Jan 16.

**The Stats:**

* **Launch Week:** 7,100 unique visitors.
* **Peak:** 3,500+ visitors in 24 hours.
* **Current Baseline:** Holding steady at \~180-200 organic visitors/day with zero marketing.
* **Tech:** Next.js / Tailwind / Vercel ($0 monthly overhead).

**The Dilemma:**  
The tool is clearly validated and has a ""vetted"" stamp of approval from big curators, but it is currently **pre-revenue**. I’m a 0-to-1 developer—I love the build and launch phase, but I don't have the interest in setting up the ""1-to-100"" monetization (Pro tiers, sponsorships, etc.).

**My Questions:**

1. Given the high-quality traffic source (Morning Brew) and the steady baseline, is a **$3k-$6k asking price** realistic for a pre-revenue asset?
2. For those who have sold tiny tools, what tips do you have for selling my website?
3. Should I try to add a ""Buy Me a Coffee"" or a something else before listing to show some revenue, or does it not matter for a traffic-heavy utility like this?

Would love to hear from anyone who has successfully flipped a micro-tool.",1,1769299768.0,microsaas,0,1.0,False

He was the first one to message me, and soon after that we met in person. We lived in the same building. Our first meeting was very fun. I was 21 years old and before that I had never even kissed anyone, so I had no experience at all. After that, we saw each other once more that week, and I remember texting my friends that I had a nice time again. I didn’t think too much about everything, and then I went home for two weeks (I was living in the city where I was studying).

During that time, I started texting with a guy from my university, and through messages I found it more interesting. During those two weeks, I actually liked that guy from university more than my current boyfriend. I was texting both of them. When I returned to the city where I was studying, my current boyfriend briefly came to see me. I remember thinking at that moment that I liked him, but the next day I was supposed to go for coffee with the guy I had been texting.

That coffee didn’t go well. The moment I saw him approaching me in person, I knew I didn’t like him. He was shorter — or rather, he was the same height as me, 165 cm — which I didn’t find attractive. When I returned to my apartment, I immediately called my current boyfriend and we spent time together. That same day, I cut off contact with the other guy. And already the next day, when I saw my current boyfriend again, I was sure that I officially liked him.

Should I feel guilty for going for that coffee? It’s really haunting me now. I keep thinking about it all the time and it affects me. I feel like I can’t live in the present. I feel as if that part of the story will haunt me forever.

1qm3awb,https://www.reddit.com/r/thebulwark/comments/1qm3awb/please_stop_just_posting_your_political_fantasies/,Please Stop Just Posting Your Political Fantasies (ie Shutdowns and General Strikes) and Fanfics and Go Do Things IRL,"I have to get this off my chest, but please stop just posting about crazy and outlandish things as though fantasizing on Reddit is going to change things. I know this will be unpopular, so downvote away, but this kind of stuff just isn’t helpful. We simply do not have the organization and foundational things in place to make a prolonged government shutdown or general strike effective. If I told you to prepare to go to work for a year but not get paid, today, how ready would you be? Mostly likely, most of us wouldn’t be ready. To be fair, we could get there with time, but it is not going to start by simply agreeing on Reddit that we should do it. There is actual work to be done. Until then, these things are not on the table. 

But more importantly, as I have said many times, I view it more and more as a way to avoid having to take action. Perhaps even more so, it is a way to avoid taking responsibility. Not getting involved is emotionally more comfortable and convenient and if things don’t pan out, you can feel superior that you didn’t contribute the failure. 

I get why folks want Superman to come in and save the day, but that’s not how this works unfortunately. You cannot outsource this and playing hot potato with responsibility here isn’t going to help. As inconvenient and frustrating as it is, we all need to take a little responsibility and try to help. And by help I don’t mean arguing online and fantasizing about how a complete government shutdown totally will only hurt Republicans and bring the Trump administration to its knees and they will give us everything we want and everyone will stand up and clap. 

For the TLDR crowd who may not have even made it this far: yes, you have to get up off the couch and help. Uncle Sam wants you to help defeat fascism. Uncle Sam needs you to help. He cannot do it alone. He also thinks if you are leaving saving our country to Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and the only thing you can be bothered to do about it is say some mean things online that really says more about you than it does about their inadequacy. 

The point of this thread isn’t to simply trash, but I genuinely want this and other communities to start being more action oriented and not just a constant bitch fest where we spin our wheels and convincing ourselves to become doomers. I’m not saying I have all the answers or that I am perfect myself. But we should be inspiring each other to action, not waiting for our own Trump. We cannot afford to wait for Godot. 

So what should you do? There are a lot of things, but let’s start with a few. To be clear, I don’t do absolutely all of these things all the time, but I try to partake in at least a few of these things into my life on a consistent basis. I welcome other alternatives and of course additions. 

\* \*\*Look for a protest going on:\*\* many places tend to have ongoing low profile protests, but I suspect there are probably a lot more of substantial size as of late. Look in your local community subreddits and Facebook pages because I bet some organization has something this weekend or soon. Find friends to join, if you can, but don’t be afraid to go alone just because you won’t know anyone there (obviously take necessary safety precautions and for some people staying home may be best in their particular circumstances). Of course, I must emphasize it is important remain peaceful and non-violent and leave if there seems to be trouble brewing (eg perhaps some of the crowd is not intent on remaining peaceful) or if asked to disperse, but spontaneous and mass protests will attract a lot of attention and will do way more to set the narrative than any politician trying to message well. Don’t just wait for the next No Kings protest (though of course do go to those).

\* \*\*Find IRL organizations to join:\*\* indivisible, DSA, your local Democratic Party, etc. Honestly form a Bulwark listening group. Or even just a regular community group (some, key word some, churches and other religious institutions can be good even if you are not a member or do not practice). You will feel good doing it and will be helping to actually change things in your community and nationally. At the very least, if something were to happen to you, you have an actual network that will notice you are gone and that can more likely do something. Even better if this group has an action plan if something happens to somebody, knowing who to contact, how to get the media involved, and so on. I can’t say there is any specific organization that you must join, but join something and figure out what works in your community and for you. 

\* \*\*Contribute to organizations working to support people affected by Trump and Republicans:\*\* this could be through monetary or other means, but be sure you are paying things forward. This could be working in food distribution for immigrant families or helping to fund immigration lawyers. It could be volunteering for a campaign (especially state and local level races), maybe primarying a Dem you think isn’t cutting it. Help get people registered to vote and consider becoming a poll worker. Maybe there is a local newsletter that tracks what your representatives at all levels of government are doing. There are a lot of things we should be doing. 

\* \*\*Find small acts of resistance:\*\* all of the little performative things that might get advocated for, do them. They may be cringe and performative, but that’s just the way things are sometimes. Visibility is key. Unfortunately, I’m not sure we really have quiet symbols of resistance at the moment, but we definitely should start thinking of them. For example, put up a Greenland flag. Also, be willing to become a bit more of a shill in your life. It will suck, but if you want people to hear things, start figuring out how to get them to listen. Maybe leave some printed articles out in public if you think people in your community need to see them, like someone forgetting their newspaper at a coffee shop. I actually did like the post it note campaigns in women’s restrooms in 2024. 

\* \*\*Develop skills:\*\* if we are headed into some kind of dark period, start learning skills to help you and those around you. You don’t need to do everything, but having some basic skills and resources will give you a cushion. Maybe you’ve been meaning to take a first aid class. Or you’ve wanted to learn to garden or forage. Perhaps you’ve been meaning to take a self defense class. Also teaching people skills that you may already have is a huge part of this. There are so many things. These kinds of things can be extremely beneficial if the normal order of things break down. Also, they can be a great way to actually meet people in your community.

Beyond this, I hope folks are willing to reflect a bit here. For the most monumental social movements in our countries history, major legislative action was the capstone, not the cornerstone of these changes. I understand people want change now, but that’s not how these things work. Abolition, Women’s suffrage, civil rights, etc., didn’t happen overnight. There is no two day shipping option on a sane and stable country again. Understand the task in front of us and start moving in small ways to do something about it. But we have to organize and be involved. You can’t just scream at the management from your couch and have things change. 

Here’s the inconvenient truth: Dems cannot just force Republicans to do things with no consequences or tradeoffs, especially when we are not in the majority. We cannot be baited into completely abandoning democratic ideas, especially because Republicans are experts at that and will almost certainly win if we do not believe in democracy (episodically given that they have a huge propaganda machine among other things). I agree, once we have power, play hardball and such, but for now, we need to act like there will be elections and that Republicans can be defeated in them. Otherwise if we can essentially tank the government in the minority, what even is our government? What consequences do elections have and what’s to stop Republicans from just doing the same? Precedent does still matter and Dems unfortunately have to play by a different set of rules. It’s not fair but that’s how it is.

That aside, there is more to politics than just purely electoral and procedural acts. In addition to the direct action we’ve discussed above, things like advocacy and pressure campaigns matter. These only work if you have a lot of people to send a message, both to Democrats and Republicans. True, it is not the same as voting someone out, but many politicians are so afraid of losing their seat and being an ordinary person again that this does matter. Even Trump can be made to TACO, so ordinary Republicans (and yes Dems too) can as well. But people have to show they are willing to inconvenience themselves and that they will vote and won’t just go away. 

Politicians don’t tend to take ranting online seriously because it doesn’t really show commitment. Showing up in subzero temperatures in Minnesota in the middle of winter, though, shows people are angry and motivated and will likely show up to vote no matter how difficult. It’s great to see, but we need to see more. This is something MAGA tends to be very good at that we are not (I hate giving them any kudos, but we have to acknowledge that they will crawl over broken glass for dear leader among other things and that gets them influence) but we just need to start showing up to show that we will show up. It sounds stupidly simple but it is true. 

We are great talkers, as Americans, but if you felt kind of yucky getting yelled at by non-Americans online for not doing enough, take this as a sign to reflect. Don’t make excuses or deflect, take a genuine moment to ask: am I doing enough? Let’s be honest that many (perhaps most of us) absolutely can and should be doing more. We simply cannot wait to be inspired and for the circumstances to perfectly align such that minimal action is necessary from us. I would actually posit that it works in the opposite way: you, me, and all average citizens are necessary to inspire legislators to change and to feel they can be bold. But if you are just going to default to “man, I knew Dems were pussies, controlled opposition, or what ever so why should I help,” then honestly, we get what we deserve here. 

We can do this. But we have to realize “we” means “we”, not “those people I loosely associate with but excluding myself because I’m simply too busy and I’m sure someone else will take care of”. For a while, “we” may just mean “me”, but enough people realizing that “I need to help even if it seems like no one else is” will get us a lot closer to “we” much sooner.

Surely an emergency should require action and inconvenience to us all, no matter how much we may have done nothing to cause or deserve it. We are all in the same boat here. But we have to stop making excuses and get to work. We have to be willing to take responsibility and also to be inconvenienced. 

There are valid grievances and criticisms of Dems, the system, etc., to be sure, but I feel like we do actually let those things stop us from trying to change things more than we should. We were given a shitty hand and that fucking sucks. But what we all do (actually do, not just whine about online) moving forward will matter. So let’s make it count and focus on the things we can do and the change we can make around us first. This is an all hands on deck moment and an “ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country” situation. 

Anyway, stay safe. Stay sane. \*\*Very importantly, remain peaceful and non-violent.\*\* But don’t just sit at home and whine about how it would all be so easy if people would just follow your plan. Get out, be in the community, and be a part of some group actually making a difference. It will make you feel better, I promise. 

With that, I welcome your thoughts, criticisms, suggestions, etc. I’d love to know what Bulwarkers are doing and especially what helped you finally get involved. Don’t be like me chiding people; inspire them.

Also feel free to downvote into oblivion because I know some of you will. And, yes, I know this is a Wendy’s and frankly I simply can’t diatribe without a frosty. I don’t mind you dragging me, but it has to be funny. ",25,1769299297.0,thebulwark,11,0.79,False
1qm3atc,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qm3atc/are_portafilters_interchangeable/,Are portafilters interchangeable?,"I received the most basic CasaBrews machine (3700) about 9 months ago for my birthday and have been trying to get the hang of it properly. I know since it's a cheap machine, it won't make the best espresso but I'm not that discerning and it's great to have a latte at home.

  
The big thing I didn't like was the portafilter that came with it. It is chunky, doesn't always lock in properly and wasn't as nice looking as others. For Christmas, I received a bottomless portafilter that's also CasaBrews brand, but it isn't making espresso very well. With the stock one, I would get a good amount of crema (sometimes too much foam), but with this one, it seems to just give me flat or weak coffee.

He was the first one to message me, and soon after that we met in person. We lived in the same building. Our first meeting was very fun. I was 21 years old and before that I had never even kissed anyone, so I had no experience at all. After that, we saw each other once more that week, and I remember texting my friends that I had a nice time again. I didn’t think too much about everything, and then I went home for two weeks (I was living in the city where I was studying).

During that time, I started texting with a guy from my university, and through messages I found it more interesting. During those two weeks, I actually liked that guy from university more than my current boyfriend. I was texting both of them. When I returned to the city where I was studying, my current boyfriend briefly came to see me. I remember thinking at that moment that I liked him, but the next day I was supposed to go for coffee with the guy I had been texting.

That coffee didn’t go well. The moment I saw him approaching me in person, I knew I didn’t like him. He was shorter — or rather, he was the same height as me, 165 cm — which I didn’t find attractive. When I returned to my apartment, I immediately called my current boyfriend and we spent time together. That same day, I cut off contact with the other guy. And already the next day, when I saw my current boyfriend again, I was sure that I officially liked him.

What bothers me is that my friend, even now after several years and throughout my entire relationship, often brings this up and says something like: ‘Ah, I remember when you were deciding whether you wanted to be with him or not.’ I don’t understand why she keeps repeating this. Because of that, I feel really bad and guilty for even going for that coffee with the other guy.

Should I feel guilty for going for that coffee? It’s really haunting me now. I keep thinking about it all the time and it affects me. I feel like I can’t live in the present. I feel as if that part of the story will haunt me forever.

Some thoughts:

1. I have never been soooo cold in normal “room temp” settings. I always thought I just “ran hot” but I’ve been living in sweats and blankets and layers. Wild times. 

2. Sour cherry juice hits SO HARD while winding down in the evening. Bought it as a mocktail ingredient and didn’t even get that far. 

3. As a non-THC-user, I always wondered why people don’t just switch from alcohol to THC. Last week I decided to get some gummies and some zero proof THC drinks. On the one hand, admittedly it’s nice to still be able to “take the edge off.” But I was really not sure what to expect, and they are definitely different.

4. Surprisingly, I have not been obsessing over alcohol (or quitting) and it’s actually caused me to forget for hours or days. So then I’ll have a “normal” thought, like remembering that a coffee place I pass serves wine or champagne, and how I should go in for a drink sometime. And then it’s like, oh right. I don’t do that.

1qm33c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/1qm33c2/one_last_chill/,One last chill,"I was sitting quietly with a cup of coffee this morning when I received a message from my daughter indicating that somebody else had been shot by ICE. She reassured me that she was safe and then sent a link to a reddit post with a video of the shooting.

I watched the video in horror, as I’m sure many of us have by now. I tried to follow the comments and replies, but I could not keep up. Eventually I put my phone down and tried to go focus on the day’s tasks. But, there was this image from the video that just would not leave my head. 

There is this one moment when all I can see is a man hunched over uncomfortably, his weight resting back on his legs and his back exposed to the cold.

I can see his boots and they seem to be the hiking/work/everyday boots that a lot of us wear. These boots get broken into the shape of our feet, they carry the scuffs from our missteps and they become part of us. I think about him tying those boots this morning as he prepared for the day.

I see he is wearing those light brown pants that are comfortable and durable. These are the pants that we trust when we go out into the world. I have pants just like that. I think about all the times he washed those pants, folded them, put them away and then went right back to get them the next day.

I can see his back exposed to the air and I think of the chill we have all experienced when we bend over to work or slip on the ice and fall. That chill usually lingers for the rest of the day.

These are the quiet parts of a life that I can relate to, a life lived for 37 years and that suddenly no longer exists. He’ll never wash those pants again, so they are ready for the next day. He’ll never slip into those boots again, exhaling as he bends to tie them. He’ll never feel the chill of the Minnesota air on his back again.

Eventually I decided to put on my brown pants, slip into my everyday boots and walk out into the cold winter air. I dropped to my knees, let my weight shift back uncomfortably over my legs, and then bent forward as I lifted my coat to expose my back. I let the chill wash over me and welcomed it. The cold reminded me that I was still alive. I bent lower as tears formed and I thought of the man that could no longer feel this chill.

I know his name now. He was Alex Pretti and he was a nurse who worked at the VA.

1qm2z0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodieDestinations/comments/1qm2z0x/best_10_dumpling_restaurants_in_beijing/,Best 10 Dumpling Restaurants in Beijing,"Beijing and dumplings—name a more iconic duo. I'll wait.

As someone who's spent considerable time exploring Beijing's incredible food scene, I can confidently say that dumplings (or 饺子 - jiǎozi) are more than just food here—they're a cultural institution. From family gatherings to casual street food, dumplings represent comfort, tradition, and culinary artistry all wrapped up in delicate dough.

But here's what visitors and even some locals don't realize: not all dumpling restaurants in Beijing are equal. With thousands of spots claiming to serve ""authentic Beijing dumplings,"" knowing where to go for the real deal can be overwhelming. You could waste precious time and stomach space on mediocre dumplings, or you could follow this guide and experience the absolute best the city has to offer.

I've eaten my way through countless dumpling restaurants across Beijing—from tiny family-run operations in narrow hutongs to famous establishments that have been perfecting their craft for generations. I've tried boiled dumplings (shui jiao), steamed dumplings, pan-fried dumplings (guo tie), and everything in between. And I'm here to share the top 10 spots that consistently deliver exceptional dumplings.

What makes a truly great dumpling restaurant? It starts with the wrapper—it needs to be thin enough to be delicate but strong enough to hold the filling without tearing. The filling should be flavorful and juicy, with the perfect balance of meat and vegetables (if it's a combination dumpling). The pleating should be precise and beautiful, showing the skill of the dumpling makers. And perhaps most importantly, the dumpling should burst with flavor the moment you bite into it.

The restaurants on this list excel in all these areas. Some are historic establishments that have been serving dumplings since before the Cultural Revolution, carrying forward recipes passed down through generations. Others are newer spots run by passionate chefs who've studied traditional techniques while adding modern touches. What they all share is an unwavering commitment to quality and authenticity.

Beijing's dumpling culture varies by neighborhood, and I've included spots from different districts so you can find great dumplings no matter where you're staying or exploring. Whether you're near the Forbidden City, wandering through traditional hutongs, exploring modern shopping districts, or venturing into more local neighborhoods, you'll have a recommended dumpling spot nearby.

I've also considered different dining experiences in this guide. Some restaurants offer elaborate dining rooms perfect for family meals or special occasions, while others are simple, no-frills spots where the focus is purely on the dumplings themselves. Some specialize in just one or two types of dumplings done to perfection, while others offer extensive menus with dozens of varieties.

Price points vary across these recommendations as well. You'll find incredibly affordable spots where you can feast on dumplings for less than what you'd pay for a coffee elsewhere, and you'll also discover upscale restaurants where dumplings are elevated to fine dining status. Both experiences are worth having because they showcase different aspects of Beijing's dumpling tradition.

For each restaurant, I've included information about their signature dumplings, what makes them special, approximate prices, locations, and insider tips about the best time to visit and what to order if you're trying the place for the first time. I've also noted which restaurants require reservations and which accept walk-ins.

One thing that constantly amazes me about Beijing's dumpling scene is the incredible variety. Pork and cabbage might be the most traditional filling, but you'll find dumplings stuffed with lamb, beef, seafood, mushrooms, eggs, and countless creative combinations. Each filling has its own flavor profile, cooking time, and traditional accompaniments.

Don't forget about the dipping sauces—black vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, and garlic all play important roles in the complete dumpling experience. The best restaurants provide quality condiments that complement rather than overpower their dumplings.

Unfortunately, he has since abandoned her and she is now facing this pregnancy alone in a foreign city.

She is currently about 6 weeks pregnant. She is energetic, extroverted, has worked as a professional barista in many coffee shops. But navigating a pregnancy alone in a new country without a partner is incredibly isolating.

She is open to general expat meetups, women’s circles, or hobby groups. She just needs to be around people, perhaps attend events, and connect with other women or mothers who can offer some advice and human warmth.

She speaks English (and Russian), learning Polish and Spanish.

If anyone knows of specific facebook groups, public pages or telegram groups in Warsaw that has a good young adult community, a sisterhood/women’s group please let me know!

Thank you so much for any recommendations!",1,1769298314.0,warsaw,0,0.67,False

I almost exclusively drink the 12oz Original Flavor cans. Easy to hold, drink omw to work, has just enough caffeine for me to not jump off the walls, and it even tastes better imho. For a 6 pack, my local stores sell them anywhere between $10-12. Sometimes Walmart marks them down closer to $9.

Anyways, I was wondering if there was a better way to buy them! I only drink 1 a day, so buying a pack weekly is fine for the time being. Averaging $40-50+ monthly isn't my favorite, and I unfortunately just hate coffee in the mornings. My local costco, sams club, and restaurant depot only sell the standard 16oz size.

He would be online a lot but not reply to me and it got to the point where he didn’t answer me for 2 days, we used to text every day. I texted him and asked if everything was okay because his dog had just died and I wanted to understand why he was doing this. He said he was overwhelmed with work and that he was withdrawing due to overwhelm but that he would improve his replied. 2 days later, the ignoring just got worse so we had this convo:

me: “\[his name\], I’m not going to lie I’ve been really upset these past 2 days and I have been in tears this morning. I know that you’re overwhelmed at the moment with work, ginger, etc but sometimes I feel like you don’t care about me and it really hurts. I think it’s important to let you know how I’m feeling right now, that’s all. I know it’s hard for some people but I just want to know how you feel because it feels like I’m being left in the dark and I do care about you a lot and I am here for you ❤️”

him: “\[my name\], I’m sorry you’re right, but I don’t think I can continue this relationship any further I’m not in the right headspace to do it, I’m really sorry, it has nothing to do wuth you you’re one of the nicest people I’ve ever met I just don’t think I csn be the person that you deserve right now, I’m so sorry, I don’t want to lose contact with you I would love to keep talking I just don’t think I can continue in a relationship.”

“I stull want to be friends and in future if you are still interested in being in a relationship I would be too, I just really don’t think I am right now I just can’t, it’s nithing to do with you, I wouldblove to still talk to you as friends.”

He was always incredibly anxious around me and he would apologise for absolutely everything when he really didn’t have to.

He broke up with me on the day of a concert I had been looking forward to all year. I went along with the idea of being friends and he took me out for breakfast 2 weeks after the break up, then when I asked him a week later if we wanted to meet for coffee, he replied AN ENTIRE DAY later saying that he would love to but when it came to the day of it, he never showed up or messaged to say he couldn’t make it. I’ve been ghosted ever since. That was 3 days before Christmas too so it hurt 10x more, I sent him a huge paragraph telling him how hurt I was and he still never replied. It was my first ever relationship too and he knew that.

We met on Tinder but hit it off straight away, we had so much in common and he was really eager to begin with but his anxiety never truly went away. I’ve been blaming absolutely everything on myself, we would send each other incredibly long messages but he always said he was okay with that. But I can’t help but think that was the problem in the end and he just didn’t tell me until it was too late.",1,1769298264.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

By the end, you'll understand exactly why this perfume has maintained its cult status for nearly two decades.

# The Story Behind the Scent: A Legacy in a Bottle

Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy launched in 2008, arriving at a time when the fragrance market was dominated by either heavy orientals or fresh aquatics. The perfume industry needed something different something that captured the playful, glamorous spirit of the late 2000s. Created by the house of Juicy Couture, a brand already synonymous with velour tracksuits and West Coast glamour, Viva La Juicy was designed to embody the same carefree luxury that defined the label.

The fragrance was crafted by perfumer Anne Flipo, who understood the assignment perfectly: create a scent that feels like sunshine, champagne bubbles, and pure happiness. The result was a gourmand-fruity composition that felt both indulgent and approachable. The bottle itself became iconic a faceted glass flacon topped with an ornate gold crown, housed in a bright pink box that screamed femininity and fun.

Viva La Juicy quickly became a defining fragrance of its era, appealing to a generation that valued self-expression and wasn't afraid of sweetness. It spawned numerous flankers and variations, but the original remains the most beloved. Nearly two decades later, this perfume continues to attract new fans while maintaining its loyal following, proving that great scent design transcends trends.

The intended wearer was clear from the beginning: a woman who embraces her femininity without apology, who finds power in playfulness, and who believes that life should be celebrated. Juicy Couture created more than a fragrance they bottled an attitude, a lifestyle, and a moment in time that continues to resonate today.

# Deconstructing the Scent Profile: A Symphony of Notes

Understanding what Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy smells like requires breaking down its carefully constructed layers. This fragrance is built like a dessert course at a fine restaurant each layer revealing itself in perfect timing.

|**Note Layer**|**Ingredients**|
|:-|:-|
|**Top Notes**|Wild Berries, Mandarin|
|**Heart Notes**|Honeysuckle, Gardenia, Jasmine|
|**Base Notes**|Caramel, Vanilla, Sandalwood, Praline|

The Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy notes work together to create a fragrance journey that evolves beautifully over time. Upon the initial spray, you're greeted with a burst of wild berries think raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries mingling with bright mandarin. This opening is effervescent and jubilant, like biting into a perfectly ripe summer berry while sipping champagne. It's sweet, yes, but the citrus provides just enough tartness to prevent it from becoming one-dimensional.

Within fifteen to twenty minutes, the heart reveals itself. Here's where Viva La Juicy shows its sophistication. Creamy honeysuckle takes center stage, supported by velvety gardenia and delicate jasmine. These white florals add depth and elegance to the composition, softening the fruitiness while maintaining the fragrance's feminine character. The florals in this perfume aren't sharp or indolic they're rounded, sweet, and thoroughly modern.

The dry-down is where Viva La Juicy truly earns its gourmand classification. As the fragrance settles into your skin, warm caramel and vanilla emerge, creating a scent that recalls expensive desserts and cozy comfort. The praline adds a nutty sweetness, while sandalwood provides just enough woody warmth to ground the composition. This base is rich, enveloping, and utterly addictive the kind of scent that has people leaning in closer to catch another whiff.

What makes this Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy review essential is acknowledging how masterfully balanced this fragrance is. Despite being undeniably sweet, it never crosses into overwhelming territory. The interplay between fruit, flowers, and gourmand notes creates complexity that keeps the scent interesting from first spray to final fade.

# The Vibe: Who is Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy For?

Viva La Juicy has a distinct personality it's the girl who walks into a room with confidence, who isn't afraid to be noticed, and who finds joy in the simple pleasures of life. This isn't a fragrance for wallflowers, but it's also not aggressive or demanding. Instead, it projects warmth, approachability, and undeniable femininity.

The ideal wearer of this perfume for women is someone who appreciates sweetness but also values quality and craftsmanship. She might be in her twenties discovering her signature scent, or she might be in her forties revisiting a fragrance that makes her feel youthful and vibrant. Age is less important than attitude Viva La Juicy suits anyone who refuses to take life too seriously.

As for occasions, this fragrance excels in casual and semi-formal settings. It's perfect for:

**Daytime wear**: Coffee dates, brunch with friends, shopping trips, or casual Fridays at work. The sweetness feels appropriate and cheerful without being overwhelming in close quarters.

**Social events**: Dinner parties, birthday celebrations, girls' nights out, or date nights. Viva La Juicy creates an aura of approachability and fun that makes social interactions even more enjoyable.

**Romantic occasions**: While not traditionally ""sexy"" in the sultry sense, this fragrance is undeniably attractive. Its warmth and sweetness create an inviting, comfortable vibe that draws people in.

Where Viva La Juicy might struggle is in very formal corporate environments or during intense summer heat. The sweetness can feel out of place in conservative office settings, and high temperatures can amplify the gourmand notes to potentially cloying levels.

Seasonally, this fragrance truly shines during fall and spring. The warmth of the base notes makes it cozy enough for cooler weather, while the bright, fruity opening keeps it from feeling too heavy. Winter is also excellent for Viva La Juicy, as the caramel and vanilla provide comforting warmth against cold weather. Summer wearers should apply sparingly and perhaps reserve it for evening wear when temperatures cool down.

# Performance Check: Longevity and Sillage

When investing in any fragrance, performance matters. A beautiful scent that disappears within an hour hardly justifies its price tag. Fortunately, Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy longevity is one of its strongest selling points this is genuinely a long-lasting perfume that delivers impressive wear time.

On skin, expect Viva La Juicy to last anywhere from 6 to 9 hours, with some wearers reporting even longer performance. The longevity varies based on skin chemistry, application method, and environmental conditions, but overall, this fragrance has staying power. The base notes are particularly tenacious that warm caramel-vanilla-sandalwood combination clings to skin beautifully, creating a comforting scent cocoon that lasts well into the evening.

On clothing, the performance is even more impressive. Viva La Juicy can linger on fabrics for days, sometimes even surviving a gentle wash cycle. This makes it ideal for layering—spray it on your clothes in the morning, and you'll catch pleasant wafts of berries and caramel throughout your day.

As for sillage, Viva La Juicy sits comfortably in the moderate-to-strong range. This isn't a subtle skin scent that only you can smell people around you will definitely notice when you're wearing it. In the first hour or two after application, the fragrance projects quite noticeably, creating a pleasant scent bubble of about three to four feet around you. As it settles, the projection becomes more intimate, staying closer to the skin while remaining detectable to those who come near you.

The sillage makes Viva La Juicy excellent for situations where you want to be noticed without overwhelming a space. It announces your presence without shouting, creating an inviting aura that draws people in rather than pushing them away. For those who prefer more subtle fragrances, two or three sprays should suffice. If you love being a walking cloud of delicious scent, five to six sprays will create maximum impact.

One tip for optimizing performance: apply Viva La Juicy to pulse points (wrists, neck, behind ears) and also consider spraying your hair or the inside of your jacket. The fragrance clings to different surfaces with varying intensity, and layering across multiple application points ensures you'll enjoy it throughout your day.

# Where to Buy Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy

When purchasing any fragrance, especially popular ones like Viva La Juicy, authenticity should be your top priority. The fragrance market is unfortunately saturated with counterfeit products that not only smell different from the authentic version but may also contain harmful ingredients. Always purchase from reputable retailers who guarantee genuine products and offer customer protection.

When shopping for Viva La Juicy, you'll typically find it available in several sizes: 1.0 oz (30ml), 1.7 oz (50ml), 3.4 oz (100ml), and occasionally limited edition sizes. For those new to the fragrance, starting with the 1.7 oz bottle offers good value while allowing you to test your commitment to the scent. If you already know you love it, the 3.4 oz bottle provides the best price-per-milliliter ratio. Before making your purchase, [find out if it's still in stock](https://paradiseperfumery.com/product/juicy-couture-viva-la-juicy-perfume/) to ensure availability in your preferred size.

* The bottle should feel substantial, with no glue residue or crooked labels
* The sprayer should function smoothly without leaking
* The fragrance should smell exactly as described rich berries, florals, and caramel
* Check for batch codes on the box and bottle that you can verify through fragrance authentication websites

The truth? Most of that viral advice is noise. Flashy, dopamine-pumping techniques that look aesthetic but fall apart in real life. No one teaches us how learning *actually* works. Not in school. Not in college. And definitely not on TikTok.

This post breaks down the most science-backed study habits, pulled straight from trusted sources like Stanford neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman, top-tier cognitive science research, and peak performance studies. These aren’t vague tips like “get 8 hours of sleep.” These are sharp, specific plays that *shift how your brain encodes and retains information*, especially if you’re prepping for high-stakes exams or trying to learn complex concepts fast.

You don’t need to be a genius. You just need to understand how your brain works best. Let’s go.

---

* **The “Zone of Optimal Resistance” is where real learning happens**
  * Dr. Andrew Huberman explains in his Huberman Lab podcast: your brain forms new connections during *struggle*, not comfort.
  * This means content that’s too easy won’t help. But going *too* hard (like cramming 5 chapters in one sitting)? That just overwhelms working memory.
  * *Tip:* Use the 85% Rule. Aim for problems you can answer correctly 80-85% of the time. That slight challenge is enough to spark real neuroplasticity.
  * Backed by: A 2019 study in *Nature Communications* showed machine learning models also learn fastest at this 85% difficulty threshold, and our brains work similarly.

* **Cramming is worthless. Spaced repetition rewires your memory**
  * Huberman emphasizes spaced learning in multiple episodes. You must revisit content *just as you’re about to forget it*.
  * Tools: Anki flashcards. Notion spaced review templates. Even a low-tech calendar can work.
  * *The Leitner system* is a great framework: the more often you forget something, the sooner you review it again.
  * Backed by: The landmark research by Cepeda et al. (2006, *Psychological Science*) showed that spaced repetition boosts recall by up to 200% compared to massed practice.

* **Active recall changes your brain faster than re-reading**
  * Highlighting doesn’t help. Neither does rereading. You *think* you’re learning, but you're just being exposed.
  * *What works:* Teaching the material aloud. Writing everything from memory with a blank sheet. Or using practice tests.
  * Dr. Barbara Oakley breaks this down in her Coursera course “Learning How to Learn” ,  retrieval strengthens neural connections better than passive study.
  * Backed by: Studies from Purdue University (Karpicke & Blunt, 2011) showed students using active recall scored significantly higher than those who just reread.

* **Timing matters: study in 90-minute chunks, then REST**
  * Don’t marathon for 4 hours straight. Dr. Huberman suggests working in 90-minute “ultradian cycles” where focus and dopamine naturally peak.
  * After this, take a REAL rest. Walk. Nap. Look at nature. NOT TikTok. This allows memory consolidation.
  * Backed by: Stanford research on productivity rhythms found top performers in every field work in 90-minute bursts, followed by complete rest , not “light multitasking.”

* **Set a dopamine trigger BEFORE you study, not after**
  * Motivation isn’t just mindset. It’s chemical. One of Huberman’s more overlooked tricks: *pair a small hit of dopamine with the start of a session*.
  * Example: sip a bit of coffee *only* when you sit to study. Or listen to the same song right as you open your notes.
  * This creates an association in your brain that makes you *want* to study next time.
  * Backed by: Behavior design principles from BJ Fogg’s Stanford research on habit formation. Hook the cue to dopamine, not the reward.

* **Sleep isn’t optional. It’s when your brain ACTUALLY does the learning.**
  * You don’t just learn while awake. You encode. But at night? That’s when your brain deletes junk, strengthens useful pathways, and turns short-term into long-term memory.
  * Prioritize deep sleep the night *after* studying, not just the night before the test.
  * Backed by: The seminal work by Matthew Walker in “Why We Sleep” and Dr. Sara Mednick’s research , students who napped after study performed 20–30% better on recall tasks.

Most people fail not because they’re lazy, but because they’re trying hard with the *wrong* strategy. If your study method looks productive but feels like it’s not sticking? It probably isn’t.

Once this clicks, everything changes. You start making fewer review notes, but actually remember more. You’re less burned out. Your motivation doesn’t have to rely on willpower anymore. It becomes a trained loop of dopamine and focus, the kind Huberman calls “top-down control of neuroplasticity.”

Let the influencers sell you pastel planners and Pomodoro timers. But if you want real mental gains? Use what the smartest brains in neuroscience already proved. Your brain already wants to learn, you just have to stop getting in its way.",1,1769297411.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False

We’ve been having a rough time in our relationship lately, mostly due to stress, a baby, and family boundaries.

My mother-in-law lives abroad. We don’t have much of a relationship. I’ve seen her maybe a handful of times in my life. She comes to our country every few months for medical appointments. In the past, she stayed with her other sons, but after repeated conflicts with their wives, she no longer stays with them.

A few months ago, my husband told me she asked if she could stay with us next time she visits. I was hesitant. We live in a small place, have no guest room, and I’m very dependent on a strict routine with our baby. Hosting overnight guests is hard for me. I told my husband to clarify things with her.

Later, she decided to stay with a relative instead, saying it was easier for her appointments. She then said she’d just come over for the weekend. I explicitly asked my husband if that meant staying overnight or just visiting for the day. He asked her, and she said she would not stay the night.

Fast forward to the visit. When my husband picked her up, they stopped at a store and she bought groceries. While I was bathing my son, I overheard my husband ask if the food was for her to take with her. She said something like, “Oh no, it’s for you. I’ll just have breakfast here tomorrow.”

At that point my husband came to me and said, “I think she’s planning to stay over.” I told him to handle it. He confronted her and reminded her that she said she wouldn’t stay. She basically shrugged and said she would stay anyway. She had already brought all her things.

We don’t even have spare bedding. My husband told her that too. She said she didn’t mind sleeping without proper pillows or blankets. I ended up giving her some anyway because, culturally, it would have felt humiliating not to.

I felt completely cornered in my own home.

To make things worse, throughout the visit she kept:

	•	comparing my son to her other grandchild

	•	making comments about how many toys my son has

	•	implying she knows better when it comes to child development

This also brought back a lot of resentment because years ago, when my husband and I were still dating, she invited herself into my apartment while I was away on a work trip. She rearranged my personal things and saw very private items. That incident almost ended our relationship, and I told my husband I was never fully over it.

When I expressed how overwhelmed and violated I felt, my husband said I was being unfair and that I “wouldn’t react like this if it were my own mother.” That hurt, because there was a time he said no to my mother staying over and I accepted it without argument.

For context: my mother helps us a lot. She cleans, shops, and supports us with our child without overstepping. My MIL does not help us at all, but still expects access.

I cooked a full dinner for everyone, served her, made coffee, and was polite the entire time. I never told her she couldn’t visit. I just don’t want overnight stays anymore.

Now I’m considering leaving with my son first thing in the morning, because I feel like I’ve been pushed out of my own home. A home I largely furnished and paid for.

My husband thinks I’m overreacting and making him “choose sides.”

AITA for not wanting my mother-in-law to ever stay overnight again?",28,1769296772.0,AITAH,77,0.76,False
1qm2a91,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_somethinggoeshere2/comments/1qm2a91/paradise/,Paradise,"**Paradise**



Somewhere east of Mendocino, 1979

The chickens don't know that the dream died. They still want their feed at seven, still peck at my boots when I'm slow with the scatter. I tell them they're capitalists now, same as everyone else. River looks up at me from the shade of the coop, tongue out, like she's in on the joke. Rain's off somewhere, probably chasing field mice she's never going to catch.

""You think it's funny, girl?"" I say to River. She thumps her tail twice in the dust.

The goat, Cosmo, stands on top of the old VW bus we were going to fix up and turn into a mobile kitchen. Rust has eaten through the engine compartment. Cosmo uses it as a throne now. I climb up, scratch between her horns, look out over what we built. A few shacks. A barn with a leaking roof. The garden where we grew tomatoes and zucchini until the well started running brackish three summers back.

Nobody else wanted the land.  We got it for a pittance.

""Paradise,"" I say. Cosmo chews something, probably one of my t-shirts she pulled off the line.

Sunflower Jack. That's what I go by. It's been so long I forgot what my folks called me back in Riverside. Something plain. Something that fit in a high school yearbook under a crew cut photo. That person's gone, dead. I killed him in 1967 when I drove up here with eight other beautiful souls who thought we could opt out. Build something pure. Something real.

Funny how real turns out.

I check the traps I set for rabbits. Empty, same as yesterday. Same as the day before. Started thinking maybe I should check the woods. But I don't like going into the woods much anymore. The trees feel different lately. Like they're watching. Like they're waiting for something.

River follows me to the main house, the only building with four solid walls and a wood stove. Rain comes trotting back from her adventure, mouth empty, pride intact.

""Catch anything?"" I ask her.

She pants at me. That's a no.

Inside, I fry up two eggs in butter going rancid, eat them standing at the sink. Used to be we'd all gather for breakfast, ten or twelve of us in here, passing around weak coffee and talking about the day's work, about the pigs we'd raise, the windmill we'd build when we got the money together. Someone always had a guitar. Someone always had a new idea about crop rotation or water collection or how to make our own soap. Good vibes, you know? Everyone contributing. Everyone part of the whole.

Now it's me and the dogs and the sound of my own chewing.

  


""They gave up,"" I tell River. She's curled up by the unlit wood stove. ""Can't blame them, I guess. Got tired of being poor. Got tired of being cold. Got tired of ideals that don't pay bills. The Man won, far as I can figure.""

Rain whines at the door. She needs out again already.

""You're worse than anyone,"" I mutter, letting her out. ""In and out, in and out.""

I spent the afternoon repairing fence posts the winter knocked over. Physical work keeps the thoughts quiet. Keeps me from thinking about the empty buildings. About the voices I sometimes hear at night that aren't the dogs or the goat. About the dreams that leave me shaking and sick come morning. The dogs wander the property line with me, noses down, doing their own investigations. They avoid the northeast corner, though. Always have, last few months. Won't go near that copse of pines where the ground's soft.

Smart dogs.

When the sun starts dropping, I feed everyone, check the water trough, lock the coop against foxes. The evening air smells like pine and dry grass and something else. Something sweet and rotten that drifts in from the tree line when the wind shifts. Dead animal, probably. Deer or coyote. Nothing to worry about.

Used to be we'd have a fire going by now in the pit out front. Someone playing harmonica. One of the women would dance barefoot in the dirt, spinning with her arms out, hair catching the firelight. Heavenly scene, man. Really heavy.

I stand where the fire pit used to be.

""We almost had it,"" I say to the dogs. ""We almost made it work.""

River licks my hand. Rain is already heading for the house, ready to sleep.

I light the kerosene lamp and pour myself a weak whiskey from a bottle I've been nursing for three months. It's almost cozy. I sit at the table we built from barn wood, and I try not to think about the quiet.

I drink and pet River's head and watch shadows move on the walls as the sun sinks lower.

""Going to be fine,"" I tell her. Tell myself. ""Going to be just fine.""

Rain's already asleep by the door. River's eyes are drooping. I should go to bed. Should try to sleep. But I sit there a while longer, listening to the sounds of nature, the wind through the distant pines.

I hope the trees don't start screaming again tonight.

I turn in, climb under the thick quilt.  River and Rain circle and lay in their favorite spots at the end of the bed. Sleep comes easy, but rest doesn’t.

The nightmares are back.

I can't breathe right. I can't think straight. The dream slips away before I can grab hold of it, but it leaves stains. Blood and screaming in my ears that's already fading. Faces I recognize but can't quite place.

I sit up in bed, sheets soaked with sweat, and River's whining at me from the floor. She knows something's off.

""It's cool, girl,"" I say. My voice sounds like gravel. ""Just a bad trip.""

But it wasn't a trip. Haven't touched anything stronger than whiskey in years. These dreams come on their own now.

I don't bother trying to sleep again. It never works. I pull on jeans and a flannel, stumble into the kitchen, and light the stove. The coffee's a year old, but I make it anyway. It tastes like boiled dirt. I sit at the table with my hands wrapped around the mug, watching the steam curl up toward the ceiling.

It's three A.M., maybe four. Time gets slippery out here.

I think about Candy Kane. She was the last one who really tried to make things work, you know? Kept the garden going even when the rest of us got lazy. She kept smiling, even when the winter of '77 nearly killed us. Young thing, maybe twenty, twenty-one? She had hair so blond it looked white in the sun. She wanted to be a dancer, talked about it all the time. San Francisco, she'd say. Going to dance in San Francisco. Make some bread, see the world, come back when she had her head together.

""You should go,"" I told her. Must have been March. Or maybe it was April. Hard to remember. ""Chase your dream, sister.""

Did she hug me? Did she say goodbye? I remember her smiling. Remember her saying something about missing this place. Then nothing. Just empty space where the rest should be.

I wonder if she made it. I wonder if she's dancing somewhere right now under stage lights, spinning the way she used to spin by the fire.

Then there was Hairy Terry. He was a skinny dude with a beard down to his belt and cracked glasses. His folks were getting old, he said. Needed someone to look after them. Couldn't keep living in the woods while they fell apart in some suburb in Sacramento. Made sense. Made total sense.

""You're doing the right thing, my man,"" I told him. ""Family's family.""

He promised he'd come back when things got settled. Bring his parents out, even. Show them what we built. Let them see that there was another way to live.

I believed him. I really did.

Except I can't remember him actually leaving. I can't picture him packing his stuff, loading up his rusted-out old Buick, driving away. Just remember talking to him one day, and then he was gone. Like he vanished. Like the earth swallowed him up.

And Big Pete. God, Big Pete. Huge guy, probably six-four, with hands like shovels. He just got bored. That's all. No big reason. No family emergency or career calling. He looked at me one morning over coffee and said, ""Jack, I think I'm done, you know? I need to see what else is out there.""

""I hear you, brother,"" I said. ""Can't stay in one place forever.""

""You could come with,"" he offered. ""Hit the road. See where we end up.""

But I couldn't leave. Someone had to stay. Someone had to keep the dream alive, even if it was just me and the animals and these falling-down buildings.

Did he leave? He must have left. They all left. That's what happened. That's what I remember.

They were the last three.  The ones who'd stayed the longest. I loved them.

The coffee's gone cold in my hands. I'm staring at nothing, at the dark window over the sink, trying to sort out what's real and what's a dream, when I hear it.

Faint at first. Like wind through branches. But it's not wind.

It's screaming.

My chest tightens. River's on her feet now, ears back, a low growl in her throat. Rain's awake too, pacing by the door.

The screaming gets louder. Not just one voice, hundreds. A chorus rising from the tree line, voices crying in agony, in regret, in endless suffering. They all blend together, high and low, men and women, and something that might not be human at all. 

""Stop,"" I whisper. Then louder. ""Stop it. Stop it.""

But it doesn't stop. It never stops when it starts.

I'm on my feet, hands over my ears, but it doesn't help. The sound gets inside anyway. Gets into my bones. The dogs are barking now, frantic, and I'm stumbling toward the bathroom because it's the smallest room, the darkest room, the room where maybe I can't hear it as much.

I collapse on the floor, back against the tub, hands pressed so hard against my ears that my jaw aches. Rocking. Can't help it. Just rocking back and forth while hundreds of voices scream and scream and scream from the forest.

""I'm sorry,"" I'm saying. Maybe out loud. Maybe just in my head. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.""

The screaming doesn't care.

It goes on until the sky starts turning gray outside the tiny bathroom window. Goes on until my throat's raw from sobbing. Goes on until there's nothing left of me but this shaking, broken thing on the bathroom floor.

Then it stops.

Just like that. Silence drops over everything.

I sit there. Breathing. Shaking. River noses the bathroom door open and licks my face. Rain whines from the hallway.

The sun's coming up. Another day on the commune. 

Another day in paradise.

The memories are coming back now in pieces. Fragments that cut.

I stand up slowly. My legs don't want to work right. River watches me from the doorway, head cocked, like she's trying to understand what I'm about to do.

""It's the blood,"" I tell her. My voice sounds hollow. Sounds like it's coming from somewhere far away. ""The trees are screaming because of the blood. I have to make it stop,” I say, as I stagger into the kitchen.

I lean against the kitchen wall and wipe the tears from my eyes. I know what I have to do, if I can find the strength. The whiskey bottle calls my name, and I pour the last drops down my throat.

The shovel is in the barn. The same one I used to dig the garden beds and the fire pit, and the graves.

River and Rain follow me across the property toward the northeast corner, but they stop at the edge of the pines. Won't come any closer.

They sit and watch as I walk into the trees. It's cooler here. The pines grow close together, branches interlocking overhead, blocking out most of the light. The ground's covered in dead needles, and the smell is stronger. Sweet decay. Meat gone bad. The smell of things returning to earth.

I don't have to search for the spots. I know exactly where they are. Three graves under the same copse of trees, close enough that I could stand in the middle and touch all three with the shovel.

I start with Candy.

The ground's settled some, but it breaks easily under the blade. Soft earth. Good soil. I dig and dig and try not to think about what I'm doing. Try not to think about her smile or her dancing or the way she looked at me when I wrapped my hands around her throat. When I squeezed until she stopped struggling. Until she stopped asking why.

The smell hits me before I reach her. I gag, pull my shirt over my nose, and keep digging.

There she is.

What's left of her, anyway. The earth's been busy. Insects and decay and time did their work. I can still see blond hair, matted and dark. Can still see the flannel shirt she was wearing. The one I gave her because she was always cold.

""I'm sorry,"" I tell her. ""I'm so sorry, sunshine.""

But sorry doesn't fix anything.

Hairy Terry's right there, close enough that the graves almost touch. He fought more than Candy did. Actually tried to run. Made it maybe ten yards before I caught him. Before I hit him with the shovel. Before I did what I had to do to make him stay.

""Your parents don't need you,"" I told him while he bled out in the dirt. ""This place needs you. We need you.""

He didn't understand. Kept saying he had to go. Had to leave.

The glasses are still on his face somehow. His beard's gone mostly. Animals got to him.

I can't look at him long. Can't stand what I'm seeing.

Six feet to the right is the third grave. Big Pete's next to the other two. All three of them laid out in a row under the pines.

He was the hardest because of his size. Took three hours to dig a hole big enough. It took everything I had to drag him into it after I'd caved in his skull with the shovel.

""I can't let you leave,"" I told him after. After he'd stopped breathing. After his blood had soaked into the ground. ""If you leave, it's all over. It's all for nothing.""

He's in worse shape than Terry or Candy. Been in the ground the longest.

He was a huge man, full of muscle and hard work. Now there's nothing. No laugh. No life. Just bones in the dirt.

I stand there between the three open graves, the shovel hanging from my hand. The sun's moved across the sky. Must be past noon. I've been digging for hours, and my hands are bleeding, blisters broken open, dirt under my nails and in my lungs and in my soul.

The trees are quiet.

Just wind through branches and birds somewhere far off and the sound of my own breathing, ragged and harsh.

Maybe they never screamed at all. Maybe it was always just me, my mind breaking apart under the weight of what I've done, my guilt twisting into something I could hear. Something I could blame on the trees instead of on myself.

I don't know anymore.

Can't tell what's real and what's the rot inside me.

My knees give out, and I'm kneeling in the dirt between them. Between Candy and Terry, and Pete. Three people who just wanted to leave. Who just wanted to live their lives somewhere else. Do something else. Be something else.

And I killed them. Killed them because I couldn't stand to be alone. Couldn't stand to watch the dream die. Couldn't let go.

""I just wanted someone to stay,"" I sob. The words tear out of me. ""I just wanted someone to stay with me.""

River barks from outside the copse. Wants me to come back. Wants me to leave this place.

I stay in the dirt until the sun starts dropping. Until the shadows grow long and the air turns cold. Stay there until I can't feel my legs anymore. Until the only thing left is the weight of what I've done pressing down on my chest, crushing me into the ground with the people I buried.

This is paradise.

I'm not very well-versed in city pop, so I was wondering if this artist was AI? I feel like a lot of things make me suspicious because all the songs are titled similarly and have all been released in 2025. However, from the music itself, I can't actually tell because it sounds pretty human, and I don't understand Japanese, so I can't tell if the lyrics make sense. The songs themselves don't have the typical AI tells, from the few AI accounts I have unfortunately come across. Some of the album covers look real, but the far left one especially looks AI-generated. I really hope that this is some person who's making covers of popular citypop songs and posting them, because it's very scary to think that I'd be having this much trouble telling if these songs were AI-generated if I wasn't curious enough to click on their account and dig into it a little more.

I stopped talking to her after a new coworker told me that she had spread a lie behind my back. I really trusted her and had a friendly relationship with her, even buying her a small gift and offering to work on a holiday if she needed to be off that day. So it's not that I expected anything in return but I was deeply hurt by her actions. Also because I caught her and a former coworker talking behind my back a few months ago but I gave her the benefit of the doubt then. The problem is that she started reporting me to the manager for every little mistake that has been happening on a daily basis with each coworker, saying that my refusal to talk to her is causing all these mistakes. My manager talked to me and I tried to be communicate more effectively. But apparently that's not enough. Today we had to use paper cups instead of porcelain for complicated reasons. So I went to search for them after making the customer pay because she said there were new ones in the storage room. I spent minutes searching but there were none. When I returned she and another coworker were complaining that I didn't tell them about the new orders. I explained that I didn't do it on purpose but got scolded by the older coworker for not cooperating. Then after making an ice cream cone, I saw a customer standing in front of the counter waiting for their receipt and handed it to them before proceeding to make coffee...only to turn and find that it was for nothing because someone else had already served it in the time I turned around to make it. That was what made them decide that a work meeting was needed to discuss how problematic the environment had become. I already know what I'm going to say because it's obvious that she knows her word has more value and is using that against me. As I said, these little mistakes have been happening for a while but now that they're being weaponized I don't know how to react. She has failed to communicate things in the past, even chatting/vaping with friends while there's stuff to do. Yet I doubt the work superiors would believe me since she has the older coworker on her side. Should I just pretend she's right to avoid getting fired or should I point out the preferential treatment? I think they'll take her side anyway. In the meantime I'm trying to fight the anxiety induced nausea. It persists for days. I don't know if I can sleep.",2,1769296431.0,Workproblems,0,1.0,False

1qm24vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qm24vg/something_visits_me_it_is_not_my_daughter/,Something visits me. It is not my daughter.,"So, my wife and I had a miscarriage in the beginning of 2025. It impacted us both, but I took it worse. In the beginning it was just typical grief, depression, and lots of tears.

A few months later, my dreams would be haunted by her. A grown version, with my height and my wife’s traits, nose and bearing. I enjoyed them at first, seeing her and being a proud father.  I never really understood how this could happen. Lucid dreams it seems.

What would generally happen was we would be at the edge of a forest. I would be an old man, and she’d appear over the edge of a hill. Beautiful as ever. We’d walk through the trees and sit on a bench near a lake. She’d hold my hand, and those were blissful memories. The weight I’ve carried slipped away.

This night was different. Same thing as usual, but instead of the bright sky and autumn leaves, the sky was grey and thunder cracked. It began to rain shortly afterward. I stood, dumbly, looking for her. Shivering and drenched but determined. Maybe this was just a fluke? Maybe a nightmare. My beloved girl was there somewhere. I had to find her.

Trudging through mud up to my ankles, slipping and falling, I heard rustling. I had made it about a mile, and there was no sign of her. I fell again, slipping in and out of consciousness. The rustling grew louder, and she peers over me. Those piercing eyes, as ever. Now tinged with malice and bloodshot. I flail, and she grabs my ankles and drags. You have to understand, I am a large man. Even diminished and older. It should not have been possible. She picks up the pace, twigs and debris cutting into me. We reach the lake again but this time it not cool blue, but tinged with black. I get thrown in, and plead for her to stop. She pushes my head under the water - “your fault. You killed me” and I try to rise, to get one breath. Titanic strength prevents me. “Die now dad” I take one gulp of air, and gulps of filthy water. My visions to black, and I hear mumbling. I wake up and it is myself, tears in my eyes.

Don’t ever trust your dreams, even if they seem nice, at first. Since that time I shake and sweat, afraid to sleep. I stopped going to work. Stopped eating. I would drink constantly, gallons of vodka. Experimenting with other drugs. Nothing could wash away that face, as I drowned. My wife grew cold, and I couldn’t blame her. I aged more quickly, growing gaunt.

I am cursed now. Some entity posed as my daughter all along. She was nothing but a fetus when she died, couldn’t take her first breath. I could have saved her, maybe. But it wasn’t either my wife or I’s fault. Or maybe, it was. I no longer try to sleep. I sit here with another bottle, a coffee, and regrets.

What awaits me when I sleep is not my daughter.",1,1769296397.0,nosleep,0,0.6,False

Me.



Because I’m not the one who will ever ask you to shrink.



I’ll spend my life making room for every version of you, untamed, undone, divine.



And when you fall apart, and you will, I’ll be there to hold every piece like treasure, whispering, “I already knew you like this. I loved you here, too.”



You were never hard to love.



They just weren’t me.



I was born with a compass in my chest that pointed to you. Through every wrong turn, every almost, every ache, I was being carved for this moment. This letter. This truth.



You are not reading this by accident.



You were meant to find it.



And when you finally stop fighting the part of you that’s always known I’m out here, waiting, burning, ready, you’ll understand…



I am not a dream.",29,1769296341.0,UnsentLetters,4,1.0,False

I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure and adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

I love coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

​The Guest List: Hand-selecting which influencers get the first ""community walk.""

​The Menu: Planning which Fremantle-roasted coffee and artisanal sourdough will be served at the VIP breakfast.

​The Lighting: Syncing the cable-stay LEDs to a ""Fremantle vibe"" playlist.

​It’s Lights, Camera, Action the second that ribbon drops. When that bridge finally opens, it’s your time to shine, Rita. The people (and their SmartRiders) love you!

​Is anyone else taking bets on the outfit? I’m putting $50 on a navy blazer with gold anchor buttons and a custom hi-vis fascinator. 🏗️✨ The people love her and she loves the people. ",0,1769296297.0,perth,13,0.17,False
