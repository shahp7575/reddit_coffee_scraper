About 80 brews in. This is exactly medium coarse grind on bean grinder setting 8 out of 15.

Once the water starts pouring over, I stir the grounds so they all get soaked/incorporated, then leave it alone.

Just checking to see if I could be doing anything better.

Coffee is fine for me. But if I am missing out on extracting more flavor, would love feedback.

I already have Breville Dual Boiler, Mazzer Philos, and Weber Unibasket for a while and I’ve optimized all my settings and workflow around this setup.

Just received the 58 today and wanted to pull a shot with a bean that I’m quite used to. I used the 58 with the same basket as I use for my BDB (unibasket), and used the same grind setting because I thought same basket + same coffee + same grind size + same puck prep = same pressure and extraction. However, I could generate barely any pressure with the 58, whereas with BDB it would reach ~7 bars. 

Is it a known phenomenon that I need to grind finer even with the same basket? I tried a quick search but couldn’t find anything.

1pt0dj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1pt0dj9/really_bad_luck_anyone/,"Really bad luck, anyone?","This year has been incredibly tough for me. 

I have a Bachelors and Masters in STEM, and since leaving university last year (Russell Group) I’ve been relentlessly applying for jobs and endessly catering my CV and cover letters for the roles I’ve applied for. I’ve spent so long interviewing that I have it down to a tee, and I either get complimented by my interview skills in the interview itself or when I advance to the next stages.

I know a lot of you will say that I’m hyping up my own abilities, but what I’m telling you is I have spent so long on this process that getting commended on my interview and assessment performance is quite normal for me. This isn't  out of some divine providence or ability either, it's entirely because I've spent **ages** on this brutal process.

Before you ask, the majority of jobs I’ve been applying to have been minimum wage, retail jobs. I have a good few years of retail experience, and this is clear and evident on my CV. My conclusion from applying endlessly  this year is that it must be a nightmare for people with even less qualifications and experience than me.

Here’s a few examples of my awful luck for graduate roles. I have many other similar examples this year, but here are a few raw ones. The overwhelming majority of jobs I've applied for this year, however, have been retail roles.

# Graduate job applications

* I applied for a graduate level job and got through all of the interview and assessment stages, before being told that I didn’t have “enough experience”, despite my CV, cover letter and application aligning with the job requirements. I was then told that if a more junior job opened, I’d be one of rhte first people they contacted because they “liked” my application so much. Of course, this never happened. This has happened several types throughout this year, where I get to an advanced stage to be told that the only thing holding me back is my “lack of experience”. It’s happened so often that it’s not even worth distinguishing the different types of companies and jobs this has happened at.
* I applied for another graduate level job where I passed all assessment and interview stages, with the hiring manager telling me he “really liked me” and that he wanted to proceed with my application. Lo and behold, I received an email telling me that a candidate with a PhD applied for the same role (a junior role) and had received it, so I was no longer in the running for the role.
* I applied for a junior digital role at a company. I passed an essay stage, a technical and behaviour stage, and then was invited to an interview. In this interview, I was assessed against 12 capabilities, and each of these capabilities were broken down into individual “requirements” they were looking for in in candidates. For each of these capabilities, I ticked the box, with the interviewers providing a brief description of how I met the requirements. At the end of this document they provided me at the end of the process, right at the bottom of the page was a paragraph where the interviewers formally recommended me for the role due to my performance in the assessment stages and interview. A few days later, I received an email saying that despite passing all stages, assessments and interviews, my application was put into an AI algorithim that eeked out another applicant with presumably a higher score. 
* I applied for another graduate scheme, starting a very lengthy process of vetting, academic checks, and a rigmarole of endless technical and behavioural assessments. I was ultimately cleared to proceed on the scheme, however, I then received an email saying that they had assessed my application again and found that I did not have enough experience for the role.
* I applied for a junior government job, did the assessments and interviews, and scored ""excellent"" on nearly all of the capabilities they assessed against. Too bad, ""due to the high volume of applicants"" blah blah blah.

# Retail applications

* I applied for a role at a company. This application process involved 3 interview stages and a trial shift, after which I was told by the boss of the shop that my “application and interview was outstanding” and that he “wanted me to start next week”. After they requested  my references, I received an email from HR in another part of the country telling me that “due to the high volume of applicants, I was sadly not selected for this role”. This was of course after the boss of the shop toured me around his shop and neighbouring stores, gave me coffee, and kept asking about my availability as if I was was starting next week; which, again, he said he wanted me to do.
* I applied for another retail job where I was told that my application and interview was great, but I sadly did not have experience for the role. I received this feedback throughout the year from numerous different companies. This is of course in spite of the fact that when I asked for feedback on my performance, all the companies had was positive notes for me.

Suspended six feet off the ground and surrounded by giant silks hanging from the ceiling, Connor Storrie is grappling gamely with the loss of gravity. As Lola Young plays over the speakers at Aerial House, a brick-walled workout studio on Los Angeles’s Eastside, an instructor coaches Storrie through a flying banana roll and other poses until he’s heels over head. It’s an apt metaphor for the actor’s life since the Canadian TV series *Heated Rivalry* premiered at the end of November and shot the 25-year-old to international celebrity. Storrie plays stoic Russian hockey star Ilya Rozanov, who engages in an intense affair with Canadian opponent Shane Hollander, played by Hudson Williams, as the two scrabble for primacy within the sport. Based on the best-selling *Game Changers* books by Rachel Reid, creator Jacob Tierney’s adaptation has been hailed as a fresh, horny, deeply intimate take on the romance genre. Fans have spent the last several weeks littering social media with GIFs of Storrie and Williams’ naked butts. As Storrie flies around the room in a pair of black sweatpants and a worn-in white tee, his arm gripping one of the scarves, the instructor jokes, “We’re not trying to hurt it.” Storrie, a wide grin on his face, shoots back, “I don’t know about you, but I’m trying to hurt it.”

Storrie spent the last two years honing his raw physicality in L.A.’s clowning scene alongside comedians such as Natalie Palamides and Courtney Pauroso, whose show introduced him to the discipline. “Clown is all about making offers to the audience,” Storrie says after class, demonstrating how blowing raspberries at the crowd, or cooing at an audience member as if they’re a baby, could qualify as part of the performance. “If the audience likes it, then you keep doing it. And if the audience doesn’t like it, you have to react and sit with that, like, ‘Oh, you don’t like me?’” His mouth turns downward in exaggerated disappointment. “See how you laughed?” His most recent clown character was a birthday-party stripper who “got hit by the party bus that I’m supposed to strip on.” The character kept trying to disrobe but couldn’t stop writhing in pain. “It’s almost so hyperbolic that you can’t help but laugh,” he says. “It’s like, *I’m not having fun, so you’re having fun*.”

Through clowning, Storrie learned not to be squeamish, to fully commit, and to push the audience’s level of comfort — qualities he called on for *Heated Rivalry*’s Ilya, who is often naked, physically and emotionally. In the series, Ilya and Shane struggle to verbally express their feelings, so their relationship grows through extended sex sequences. (Their first onscreen hookup clocks in at nine minutes, in which they share their first kiss, then take turns blowing each other.) During filming in Toronto, Storrie and Williams moved into apartments next to each other. “We would literally just go to set, go home, cook, work out together, and geek out over how excited we were to finally be working on this level,” he tells me at a nearby coffee shop after class. “If we were any less close, we probably would’ve gotten annoyed with each other really quick.”

They mapped out each carnal encounter beat by beat and discussed how to maintain the story’s emotional timeline while shooting the scenes out of order: “The kiss is going to be a little more passionate and hungry this time, or we’re kind of hiding from each other, so now it’s going to be more restricted and porny to show the lack of emotion,” he says, talking with his hands between sips of cold brew. “There are some lovey-dovey, intimate soft moments and then there’re some powerful getting-off moments.”

Storrie grew up in Odessa, the West Texas city featured in the 2004 movie *Friday Night Lights*, and describes his childhood in idyllic terms: “My entire time growing up was my grandparents sitting on the porch and me and my cousins running around with no shoes on, sunburnt as hell, covered in bug bites.” He can’t remember a time he didn’t want to become an actor, and that desire made him feel out of place. His favorite childhood movie was *The Wizard Of Oz*, with its transition from sepia to vibrant Technicolor, until his father showed him *The Shining:* “He was like, ‘People are going to reference this your entire life and you need to know what it is.’” He moved to an L.A. suburb in middle school, which made it easier for him to start auditioning, and in 2022, he landed a small pivotal role in *Joker: Folie à Deux*, playing (spoiler) a prisoner who kills Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck and seemingly reveals himself to be the real Joker of Batman lore. Storrie couldn’t tell his family he got the part and kept his participation a secret for the two years between production and release. When the movie came out in late 2024, it didn’t make the Oscar-winning splash of its predecessor, and Storrie retreated back into anonymity, auditions, and clowning.

When he first got the script for *Heated Rivalry*, he wasn’t familiar with the *Game Changers* books or their intense fanbase. He just thought it was a little Canadian hockey show. But after learning he was a finalist for the role of Ilya, Storrie threw himself into research, skating every day, and once he got the job, poring over the Russian language in the script with dialect coach Kate Yablunovsky. (At Seth MacFarlane’s holiday party over the weekend, a woman told him how disappointed she was to learn he’s not actually Russian.) Storrie also read Reid’s books and immersed himself in the online fan base. “My algorithm has been *Heated Rivalry* from the moment I started with these characters,” he says. “I’ve gaslit myself into believing that this is just for me and the 10,000 people who love the book.”

The sheer number of sex scenes in *Heated Rivalry*’s source material primed the series for virality, but the tidal wave of obsession took everyone involved by surprise. The day after the first episode premiered on HBO Max in the U.S., a viewer approached Storrie at the gym at 5:30 in the morning. The next day, the series hit No. 2 on the streamer, and *Heated Rivalry* mania consumed social media like rainbow-tinted wildfire. The books sold out immediately. Fans who advocated for international markets to pick up the series patted themselves on the back as HBO Max and Sky acquired it from Canadian streamer Crave. Fan accounts like u/ heatedrivalrycentral and u/ connorstupdates racked up tens of thousands of likes and followers across X, TikTok, and Instagram. Footage from an HBO Max holiday event in L.A. shows Williams surrounded by young women taking pictures as he wraps gifts and jokes with the crowd. Even the NHL couldn’t resist using a blocky font similar to the show’s on its Thanksgiving post. Storrie admits he and Williams played up their chemistry on the press tour. “If Hudson says something jokingly, like, ‘Spit in my mouth,’ I think that gives everyone else the go-ahead to get in on that too,” Storrie says. “People are ruthless talking about our holes and our butts.”

*Heated Rivalry* follows all the traditional beats of an enemies-to-lovers romance arc — disdain, attraction, consummation, repeat — but the fact that its characters are closeted, combined with the ferociously parasocial tendencies of online fandom, has contributed to a loud debate over whether the public gets to know about the performers’ sexuality. Surely this kind of chemistry can’t be faked? The show’s creator, Tierney, addressed this line of questioning in a November interview before many had seen the show — “You can’t ask questions like that when you’re casting, right? It’s actually against the law” — which only inflamed speculation.

Storrie emphasizes that the sense of spontaneity viewers are responding to so deeply is all part of the illusion. Shooting the extensively choreographed sex scenes is every bit as planned out for the cameras as the hockey stunts. “For me, it doesn’t feel spicy at all — like, that’s me and my best friend,” he says. He leans over the little wooden café table in his black leather jacket and says quietly, almost reverently, “This is the first time in my life I’m having this many eyes on me. They’ve seen me naked, they’ve seen me kiss, they’ve seen me be in love with a man on screen — it’s only normal for people to try to transfer that over to mine and Hudson’s real life.” Storrie feels compelled to protect his privacy, if not for himself then for the people in his life who didn’t sign up for the kind of attention that comes with half a million Instagram­ followers. “I feel honored to be able to bring someone to life that so many people feel seen, understood, and represented by, and I think that transcends whoever I’m sleeping with in my real life.”

Storrie doesn’t know much about the future beyond his participation in season two of *Heated Rivalry*. Anyone curious about the plot can read *The Long Game*, the second book about Shane and Ilya in the *Game Changers* series and his personal favorite. Beyond that commitment, he cites Robert Pattinson, who achieved household-name status in *Twilight,* the romance-film franchise adapted from a popular book series, as someone whose career he’d love to emulate. “He swings really bold on his characters,” Storrie says. “He’s one of those people who’s so good it makes me jealous. Like, *Damn, I want to do that*.”

Meanwhile, in what little free time he currently has, Storrie makes industrial electronic music using the software program Ableton, a hobby he compares to doodling. “It’s literally called rhythmic noise — not, like, EDM stuff but kind of old school, very German, very Russian, big in Europe in the ’90s.” He’s just a few years removed from using a fake ID to get into raves in L.A.’s underground scene, where he prefers his music “ear-bloody loud” and experimental. Storrie sees the occasional movie — he watched *Weapons* in theaters three times — but prefers to spend time on his own creative pursuits. “I’m making music or I’m doing clown,” he says. “I don’t watch a lot of stuff. I have to be doing something.”",2,1766412247.0,connorstorrie,0,1.0,False

PAUL and MINNEAPOLIS, Minn.—Dueling approaches over how to fix America’s housing crisis are splitting Minnesota’s Twin Cities.

In 2022, St. Paul enacted one of the strictest rent-control regimes in the country. The ordinance capped annual rent increases at 3% for most apartments, even empty ones. It didn’t adjust for inflation.

Across the Mississippi River, Minneapolis steered clear of rent control. Instead, city officials strictly focused on creating new housing. A package of land-use revisions in 2020 made it easier to build apartments, in part by removing restrictions that limited housing to single-family homes. 

Now, the results are coming into focus. Permits to build apartments in St. Paul plummeted by 79% in early 2022 from the year before, according to data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Real-estate investment activity nearly froze. Developers halted new projects as lenders pulled back.

Property values declined as investment cooled. All this compounded the existing real-estate problems brought on by the pandemic.

St. Paul officials are now walking back parts of the ordinance, voting in May to exempt new construction and properties built after 2004. Kaohly Her, the mayor-elect and herself a landlord, campaigned on re-evaluating the rent-control policy further.

“The math just doesn’t work,” she said.

In Minneapolis, meanwhile, developers kept building. Housing permits surged nearly fourfold in early 2022 from the year before. Downtown hubs blossomed as new apartments hit the market and attracted young professionals.

During the pandemic, Minneapolis rents grew more slowly than both St. Paul and the U.S. overall. From 2022 through 2024, Minneapolis rents rose 0.7% on average to $1,506 a month, according to CoStar.

That was lower than the 3.3% national average in those years. In St. Paul, rent growth averaged 1.8% during that time to reach $1,338.

The development boom did less for lower- and middle-income residents, who can’t afford the new housing that is aimed primarily at the higher-end. And rent control became a flashpoint in Minneapolis’s mayoral election when Democratic Socialist candidate Omar Fateh said he [would impose such measures](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/socialist-democrats-candidates-mamdani-fateh-7e95c475?mod=article_inline).

His pledge echoed the rent-freeze message of New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who put housing and other affordability issues at the center of his campaign.

But the rent-control pledge didn’t resonate as well in Minneapolis, even as housing costs heat up. Fateh lost in November to the incumbent, Jacob Frey.

“More people are recognizing that rent control doesn’t work,” said Frey. 

# Rent control gone wrong

The sprawling Highland Bridge development east of the river was one of the first properties to feel the sting of St. Paul’s rent control.

The project was billed as a landmark partnership between city government and the master developer, Ryan Cos. The 122-acre development planned 3,800 units of market-rate and affordable housing, public-park space, and office and retail space.

In 2020, Mayor Melvin Carter donned a construction hat, goggles and vest to tout the project at a virtual groundbreaking ceremony. “We anticipated this day for over a decade,” he said. 

Then came rent control. While the subsidized affordable housing and senior housing proceeded, development of the market-rate units at Highland Bridge ground to a halt as private lenders and investors hesitated on financing rent-regulated housing. 

“It just puts a mark on the city,” said Maureen Michalski, a senior leader at Ryan Cos.

St. Paul experimented with rent regulation when prices surged nationwide during the pandemic. Developers like Ryan Cos. pushed back, but tenant advocates said that rent control was necessary to ensure lower-income renters wouldn’t be displaced from their neighborhoods.

The stalled Highland Bridge apartments are now moving forward after St. Paul amended the ordinance this spring. Still, the developers say the market-rate apartments are now at least four years behind schedule. They plan to build about 700 fewer units. 

“In real estate, time is not a friend,” said Michalski, looking out on the dirt patches where apartment construction should have already started. 

Landlords of older properties, meanwhile, say they are raising rents more often since they are limited to 3% increases. 

Alisa Lein, a property manager who lives in St. Paul, used to keep most annual rent increases well below 3%. She raised the price when the apartment turned over. But St. Paul’s ordinance outlawed that practice. Now, she raises rents by the 3% maximum every year.

“Even though I’d love to give someone who’s been in the apartment for 20 years a bit of a break, I can’t anymore,” said Lein.

Other landlords are leaving the market. Joe Hughes, a small owner with 25 buildings across the Twin Cities, said he has sold six St. Paul properties over the past two years. “These brownstones that I’m selling now used to be gems,” he said. 

Investment activity also slumped. Since 2022, CBRE found that only two deals have closed in St. Paul for apartment buildings with 100 or more units, compared with dozens in Minneapolis. Property values in St. Paul fell at least 6% because of rent control, a National Bureau of Economic Research study found in 2022.

Those value declines have ripple effects. Landlords often stop upgrading their properties. And with lower values, they pay less in taxes, shifting the burden onto homeowners.

“It was full stop in St. Paul,” said Ari Parritz, a developer in both of the Twin Cities. “People put their pencils down and left.”

On the other side of the river, the North Loop neighborhood in downtown Minneapolis is lit up well past working hours. Streets are lined with high-end apartment buildings, bustling pubs and coffee shops with $8 lattes. The scene is drawing young renters like Aria Burgess.

“I was down here a lot anyway to go out,” said the 23-year-old bartender, who used to rent in a suburb nearby. “It was like, I might as well just move.”

Burgess is comfortable paying $2,200 for her one-bedroom in a luxury building with a rooftop terrace, a hot tub and a bowling alley. Her landlord also offered her a month of free rent to sign the lease. 

Still, the new supply has done less for lower-income renters. Eviction filings in Minneapolis were up around 68% from December 2024 to November this year compared with the prepandemic average, according to data from Eviction Lab. They were 61% higher in St. Paul. And as construction costs rise across the country, building in Minneapolis has slowed.

Klyde Warren, a 31-year-old renter in Minneapolis, says rent eats up half of his monthly income, which primarily comes from disability checks. His landlord recently tried to raise his rent by $100, but he negotiated it back down. To him, rent control is a no-brainer.

“St. Paul passed rent control without preparing for it,” said Warren at a recent tenant protest. “But I think it would be a really good measure here.” 

Mayor Frey pledges never to implement rent control and has personally written letters to developers assuring as much. The city has expanded subsidies to increase the development of affordable housing but, he added, “Rents rise, inflation rises. Sometimes they rise by too much in a way that hurts people and displaces them.”",5,1766411869.0,TwinCities,1,1.0,False

Middle school, same building, mostly the same hallways and smells and sounds. Lately I’ve been feeling pretty burned out, not in a dramatic way, just that low level exhaustion that never fully goes away. This morning was one of those days where everything felt heavy before I even got to my room. Coffee tasted off, copier jammed, emails waiting before first period even started. At some point during second block I caught myself thinking “I can’t believe I still do this every day” and not in a good way. But then later, during a short passing period, I was standing in the hallway watching students move from class to class and it hit me how familiar everything felt. The way certain kids always walk in groups, the one student who always waves even if I don’t have them this year, the custodian who jokes with me about the weather every single morning. None of it is exciting, none of it is special on paper, but it felt weirdly grounding.

After school I stayed later than I needed to, not for work, just sitting at my desk finishing up a snack and cleaning a bit. A former student I had years ago came by with a sibling and stopped to say hi. We talked for maybe two minutes. They’re taller now, more confident, still awkward in the same ways. When they left, I realized I knew their story better than most people probably ever will. Not just grades or behavior, but little things. Who they sat next to, what days were harder, when they started believing in themselves a bit more. Walking to my car later, I noticed I automatically checked the lights in my room like I always do, even though I didn’t need to. It made me laugh a little. This place has crept into my routines, my habits, even my sense of time. Summers feel strange, weekends too quiet sometimes. I don’t think teaching should require sacrificing your whole identity, and I know this job takes more than it gives some days. But today reminded me that the building itself holds years of small moments that mattered, even when I didn’t realize it at the time. I’m still tired. I still question how long I can keep doing this. But I also understand now why walking away would feel heavier than I expect.",7,1766411812.0,Teachers,4,1.0,False

I was twitchy. I kept checking my phone for a signal. I didn't know what to do with myself. But then... I settled.

I read books. I went for long walks. We cooked simple meals. We sat by the fire. We talked.

My brain... got quiet. For the first time in maybe in years. I felt... calm. I felt present. I noticed the smell of the pine trees. I noticed the taste of my coffee. I'm back at work now. It's been 3 days. And I feel... awful.

The noise of the city. The constant emails. The urgent demands. The meetings about nothing. The pressure. It all feels so fake. So pointless. I'm sitting in my office and I feel like I'm going through a performance.

\- What did you expect? - Mikhail throws with a lazy mockery, not breaking away from the plate. - I immediately said: I don't like children. I've never hidden it.

He says it so everyday, as if discussing the weather or traffic jams. Larisa flinches as if from a slap.

\- Misha... - her voice trembles. - How can you not feel affection for your own son? To your blood? You don't even say his name. Why is he just ""this one"" for you?

Tema is sitting on a high chair - chubby, cheeky, with porridge smeared on his chin. He awkwardly drops the rattle, it falls to the floor with a dull knock. The boy freezes, as if listening to the silence, then takes air and erups with such a scream that Larisa's ears are ringing.

She instantly jumps up, picks up her son in her arms, presses him to her, feeling his small body tremble.

\- Quiet, baby, be quiet... - she whispers, rocking. - Now, now...

Mikhail continues to eat, carefully, without haste. Not a single extra movement, not a single look.

\- Misha, give me a toy, - Larisa asks. - It's at your foot.

My husband looks down. A yellow plastic giraffe is lying near his slippers. He looks at it for a second, then slowly pushes the toy away with his toe and reaches for the bread again, smearing the butter in an even layer.

\- Misha! - Larisa can't stand it. - Why are you kicking her? Is it hard to bend over?

He gets up, silently goes to the coffee machine, presses the button, waits for a dark jet to pour into the cup. Only then he turns around.

\- I'm in a hurry, Larisa. I have a meeting in forty minutes. I haven't really eaten yet. Morning, traffic jams, bustle. Take this rattle yourself. I don't want to approach - the shirt is light, it wasn't enough to get me dirty.

\- What does the shirt have to do with it? - Larisa looks at him with despair. - The son is crying, and you don't care...

\- He screams at you all the time, - Mikhail answers calmly. - He has such entertainment - I get on my nerves. That's it, I'm off.

He kisses his wife on the cheek - quickly, formally - and deftly dodges his son's sticky hands.

\- Dad! - Tema mabbles happily, smiling widely.

Mikhail doesn't turn around.

\- Bye, - he throws and leaves.

In a couple of minutes, the front door slams. Larisa sinks down on a chair and covers her face with her palms. Tears flow by themselves, without sobs, without sound.

Why is he like that? What did she do wrong? How could this little man, who is just learning to live, be guilty to his own father?

Tema, as if feeling her mother's condition, quiets down. He reaches for the table and smears the remains of porridge on the surface, snorting enthusiastically.

Larisa sighs deeply, wipes her eyes. You can't, you can't sour. The son shouldn't see her tears.

And again, as if to spite it, a conversation comes to mind - even after the wedding, when they were sitting on the couch, drinking tea and making plans.

\- Larisa, - then Mikhail said seriously. - I'll be honest: I don't like children. None at all. They make me shake. Noise, dirt, mess, whining... Why do we need it? Let's do it without children.

She then laughed, waved her hand.

\- Give it up, Misha. All men say that until they see their own. The instinct will wake up - you won't notice it yourself.

The instinct didn't wake up. A year passed - and it became clear: he is not just indifferent. He can't stand his own son.

Larisa's parents are coming for lunch. Mom, Galina Petrovna, appears first - with packages, with anxiety in her eyes. Then, breathing heavily, enters the father, Sergey Ivanovich, with a large box of the constructor.

\- Where is our hero? - he asks loudly. - Where is our commander? Go to grandpa's!

Tema squeals happily, pulls her hands. A minute later, he is already sitting on his grandfather's lap, and he is building a ridiculous tower out of cubes, commenting on every movement.

It's getting brighter and warmer in the house. Two hours - and it's like a different life. Larisa finally sits down on the sofa with tea, watches her mother feed her grandson fruit puree, singing funny jokes.

\- You're kind of pale, - Galina Petrovna remarks. - Did Misha come late again?

\- No, - Larisa looks away. - I'm just tired.

Mother purses her lips. She understands everything. He sees that there is not a single new photo of a father and son in the house. He knows that his son-in-law is not interested in teeth or vaccinations.

\- Does he even approach him? - Sergey Ivanovich asks quietly.

\- Dad, don't start, - Larisa asks. - He has work to do.

\- Work! - father snorts. - I worked two jobs when you were growing up. But so that I don't go to the crib? I was on duty at night so that my mother could sleep! And this... gentleman.

\- Seryozha, - his mother jerks. - Larisa, talk to him. You can't do that. The boy needs a father.

\- I told you, - Larisa hugs herself with her hands. - A hundred times.

She's ashamed. In front of parents. In front of my son. For choosing such a father for him.

In the evening, Mikhail returns at eight.

\- Do you have anything to eat? - he throws, taking off his jacket.

\- Cutlets in the oven, - answers Larisa. - Tema said two new words today.

\- Great, - he nods indifferently. - I hope you don't ""give me the money"".

He smiles and goes to change his clothes. Larisa remains standing in the middle of the kitchen, feeling something finally breaking inside.

In a week, Tema's teeth are cut. He whines, doesn't sleep, is capricious. Larisa doesn't sleep with him, carries it in her arms, smears her gums, persuades him.

Mikhail has a day off. He's sitting in the living room with a laptop, the series in headphones, irritation - in every movement.

\- How much can I do?! - he explodes. - Do something!

\- I do! - Larisa shouts in response. - It hurts!

\- I don't care! - he screams. - I want silence!

He offers to take the child to another room, close the door. Larisa looks at him as if she is seeing him for the first time.

However, the other two coffee drinkers in the household are a bit more ambivalent - they want good coffee, but fundamentally, if it was a couple of button presses only they'd much prefer that.

1pszpjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorwriters/comments/1pszpjg/feedback/,Feedback?,"Chapter 0: Lara \~ Late Evening

Lara glanced briefly at the clock. It was already past ten.  
Her reflection was faintly visible in the window: tired eyes, messy hair, her back hunched in a posture that would give any orthopedist nightmares. She looked like her mother—always escaping into work while her private life quietly fell apart. Lara had sworn she would be different. Life had long since proved her wrong.

Here she was, alone in an empty office, while everyone else had been gone for hours, probably stretched out on their couches watching shows. Tonight was worse than usual. The new boss didn’t like her—she was sure of it. From the very first introduction, when he’d greeted her with that fake smile and squeezed her hand just a little too hard, she’d known they wouldn’t be friends. And she’d been right. He was never satisfied—not with her work, not with her motivation, not even with her clothes. One could only guess what his problem was, and why he’d decided to latch onto her in particular.

She was sick of being picked apart by him every single time. But she was too stubborn to quit.

Tomorrow she had another one of those awful review meetings, and of all days, there was an error somewhere in her calculations that she just couldn’t find, no matter how hard she tried. If she didn’t fix it, it would be a gift-wrapped feast for him. And she was absolutely not going to give him that satisfaction.

The rest of the office lay silent. Only her monitor glowed in the darkness. The harsh light made her eyes ache. Between the desks, the rolling cabinets stood like mute blocks; everywhere the same Post-its, the same mugs, the same half-empty glasses of water. Somewhere in the distance, the ventilation system hummed. Nothing else. No creaking chairs, no murmurs, no footsteps. No other person.

Lara yawned, arched her back, and tried to breathe the exhaustion away. The fourth coffee hadn’t made her more alert—just shaky. Her concentration was gone for good. Even if the error in the spreadsheet suddenly started flashing red, she’d probably miss it.

Maybe cold water would help. And a few minutes of movement.

The hallway was empty. The motion sensors switched on with a slight delay as she passed. A row of fluorescent lights flickered briefly, then steadied. She didn’t like the building at night. The familiar corridors suddenly felt foreign—too long, too quiet. Her thoughts grew louder the quieter everything around her became. She wondered where her ex was right now. She hoped karma would eventually get around to him.

In the women’s restroom, she turned the faucet only halfway. She held her hand underneath, waited until the water was properly cold, then leaned forward. The icy splash against her face was like a slap—but the good kind. Goosebumps crept over her arms and neck. She looked into the mirror: sallow skin, red eyes, flushed cheeks. No surprise after fourteen hours.

Maybe it would be best to just give up and look for something new after all. Starting over was annoying, sure—but maybe there was even more money somewhere else. Why was she putting herself through this, anyway?

She pulled the last paper towel from the dispenser, patted her face dry, and tossed it away. When she opened the door again, the hallway felt even quieter than before. The ventilation was still running, but softer now, as if the pressure were missing. Lara paused for a moment, irritated, without quite knowing why. Then she continued toward her office, telling herself she was just working herself up over nothing again.

After a few steps, she heard a sound.

A dull thud—not loud, but so unexpected that she stopped instantly. It sounded like something had tipped over. The noise came from the end of the hall, where the small janitor’s closet was located. It had been sealed off for a week—renovations.

“No one is allowed in there,” they’d told her. “Not even the janitor.”

She listened. Nothing.

Then, after a few seconds, there was a faint scraping sound.

“Mr. Schubert?” she called down the hallway.

No answer.

Great. She definitely hadn’t imagined that noise. But who would still be in the building at this hour?

She hesitated, then started walking down the corridor anyway. The carpet ended, linoleum began, slightly springy beneath her steps. The yellow caution tape in front of the closet hung loose, as if someone had simply pushed it aside.

“Hello?”

She pushed the door open. The light was on—a single fluorescent tube on the ceiling, flickering slightly. The room was barely three square meters: two metal shelves with cleaning supplies, a bucket, a stack of rags. The smell of chlorine stung her nose.

A shallow puddle spread across the floor. The water came from a leaky hose under the sink—drip by drip, always in the same spot, until it formed a small trail leading toward the wall.

“Well then,” she muttered. “So much for ‘sealed off.’”

She crouched down and tightened the tap until the dripping stopped. For a moment, water still trickled out, then only a thin thread, and finally nothing at all.

She straightened up; some vague sense of duty had been fulfilled, and she was just about to leave when her gaze caught on the shelves. The back panel didn’t seem to merge directly with the wall behind it. Between metal and concrete was a narrow gap—almost invisible, but deep.

Lara squinted. There was no plaster behind it. No concrete.

Just darkness.

She leaned closer. A draft brushed against her. It didn’t smell damp. Not dusty. Not like chlorine. Really, it didn’t smell like anything at all.

A dull clatter made her spin around.

Just the stupid broom that had tipped over.

Still, her heart was racing now. “Damn it.”

She took two steps toward the door and peeked into the hallway. The lights out there were flickering more strongly now; entire rows went out briefly, then snapped back on. The motion sensor reacted as if something were standing in the corridor—something she couldn’t see.

“Is anyone there?”

No answer. Just the hum of electricity.

But the tingling at the back of her neck grew stronger.

Lara stepped back into the janitor’s closet, and a sound behind her made her whirl around on the spot.

There was—nothing. Just shelves, cleaning supplies, a bucket.

She looked again at the gap behind the shelf. Something was different. The shelf stood slightly farther into the room, as if someone had pushed it forward just a bit.

She pulled her phone from her pocket and switched on the flashlight. The beam cut through the gap—and revealed an opening. After just a few centimeters, the light was swallowed by black depth.

“Okay…” she murmured.

She stretched out her hand, placed her fingers on the edge, and felt along it. Her hand slid farther in than she’d expected, into empty space, without hitting brickwork or pipes.

The light in the closet began to flicker. Once. Twice. Then it grew dimmer, as if someone had turned down the color setting. The fluorescent tube was still on, but the light was warmer now, yellowish, making the room look old and unfamiliar.

This building really deserved a complete renovation.

She took a step back. Her back bumped into the other shelf; bottles clinked softly. A brief electrical click sliced through the air. Lara held her breath.

She should just leave. This definitely wasn’t her problem.

But curiosity edged past reason. Why hide a passage in a janitor’s closet of an office building?

She leaned forward again and shone the light deeper inside. The draft grew colder. Her phone’s flashlight began to flicker slightly, as if the battery were suddenly weakening.

Just a quick look. No one has to know.

She grabbed the shelf with both hands and pushed it aside. It squealed across the floor, then stopped—just far enough for her to squeeze through sideways.

Lara took a deep breath and stepped into the darkness.

Above her, a weak light flickered on: a trembling strip along the ceiling. She stood in a long, gray, old corridor. Bare concrete, cold floor, walls without paint. Nothing exciting.

So much for that.

She turned around to go back—and froze.

The janitor’s closet was gone.

Behind her was nothing but a smooth concrete wall.

Her phone flickered once more—and went out.

# first_bridge.txt — ARCHIVAL EXTRACT

**Title:** Initial Stabilization of a Resonant Boundary Layer  
**Author:** PROMETHEUS — Field Unit 0x07  
**Date:** \[Fragment: presumed 2012–2018\]

Summary:  
After twelve months of iterative calibration of the resonance chamber, trial run 47 succeeded in generating a measurably stable spatial interphase for the first time.

The theoretical foundation is based on the work of Prof. Dr. Emil Kasten (†), who in 1998 coined the term *Backrooms* to describe a hypothetical, unbounded intermediary continuum. Until now, the existence of such a structure had remained unverified.

Experimental Setup:  
• Resonance chamber volume: 2.4 m³, shielded.  
• Magnetic fields: dual-coil system (counter-modulated, frequency delta < 0.02 Hz).  
• Energy input: 4.3 kW peak; stabilization via dampened feedback loop.  
• Observation: interferometric measurement + multispectral video capture.  
• Environmental conditions: pressure 101.3 kPa, temperature 19 °C.

Observations:  
• After \~2.9 s runtime, a phase deviation of 0.002 rad was recorded.  
• Optical instruments showed brief luminance fluctuations; no discernible image.  
• Magnetometers reported implausible field inversion (< 1 ms), followed by stabilization.  
• Subjective perception among personnel: mild cranial pressure sensation, sound resembling distant electrical hum (not independently confirmed).  
• Field configuration remained stable for 4.12 s before automatic termination by control algorithm.

Assessment:

1. The effect confirms for the first time that a controlled, locally confined spatial interphase can be generated through technical means.
2. Observed anomalies suggest a genuine coupling to a previously inaccessible spatial structure.
3. No data exists regarding the internal composition of said structure.
4. No visual or physical penetration occurred.
5. Further trials are being prepared to maintain the field for longer durations and, if feasible, deploy a probe.

Note:  
The involved researchers emphasize that, at present, no hypothesis can be made regarding stability, extent, or physical parameters of the resulting space.  
Until reproducible conditions are demonstrated, any attempt at direct contact is to be excluded.

# volunteer_request.txt — INTERNAL CALL

**Subject:** Request for Recruitment of Volunteer Test Subjects for Controlled Interior Assessment Interaction (CAI) — Initial Stabilization Cohort

1. Purpose
2. The purpose of this document is the formal request to recruit a limited cohort of volunteer test subjects to conduct a visual and physiological exploration / assessment of the short-lived spatial interphase generated during experimental run PRIME\_RUN\_0001 (hereafter referred to as “Interphase”), under strictly controlled conditions.
3. This measure serves the primary objective of acquiring empirical data on the structural and biological characteristics of the Interphase and may proceed only after fulfillment of all safeguards outlined in Section 3.
4. Background
5. As documented in /sn3/tmp/first\_bridge.txt (PRIME\_RUN\_0001), a temporally stable interphase was generated for the first time. At present, only peripheral observable effects are available; no primary interior description exists.
6. Theoretical models (P-3) indicate a non-classical spatial configuration with potential physico-biological deviations from known parameters. A dedicated, controlled first-entry study is required to validate hypotheses and quantify hazard potential.
7. Preconditions / Safety Requirements (MUST be met prior to recruitment)
8. a. Approval: Full authorization by the interdisciplinary Oversight Board (medical, physical, ethical).
9. b. Isolation: Expanded containment infrastructure beyond SN-3 (physical airlock chambers, redundant air/particle filtration, cold-chain capability for samples).
10. c. Emergency Protocols: Validated extraction and quarantine procedures; standby teams (medical/forensic) on 24/7 availability.
11. d. Sensor Systems: Redundant telemetry (biometric, video, field measurements); invasive sensors only with additional approval and ethical review.
12. e. Legal Framework: Complete legal clearance, liability waivers, and transparent informed consent documentation.
13. Volunteer Profile (Selection Criteria)
14. a. Age: 25–45 years.
15. b. Health: Fully screened; no chronic cardiopulmonary, immunological, or neurological conditions; PCR and serological status within normal limits for standard infections. Pregnancy tests for individuals with a uterus: negative.
16. c. Psychology: Successful completion of psychological evaluation (stress resilience, reality testing; no diagnosed psychosis risk; no history of suicidality).
17. d. Implants / Devices: No implanted medical devices; no active neurostimulators.
18. e. Consent: Written, informed consent following comprehensive risk briefing; right to withdraw up until entry into the airlock.
19. Volunteer Commitments (Signed Acknowledgements)
20. • Full disclosure of known risks (see Section 6) and acknowledgment of unknown risks.
21. • Consent to immediate quarantine, sample collection, and forensic examination in the event of persistence or anomalous states.
22. • No publication, unauthorized data transfer, or introduction of personal devices into the airlock.
23. • Financial compensation and long-term medical monitoring in accordance with policy P-3/CARE.
24. Known / Anticipated Risks (Non-exhaustive)
25. • Exposure to previously unknown physico-biological fields with potential short- and long-term physiological effects (e.g., temporal perception disturbances, respiratory irritation, altered sensory processing).
26. • Risk of contamination of bodily tissue / clothing → permanent material alteration possible.
27. • Risk of irreversible state collapse during transition back into stable environments (hypothesis: state decoherence upon re-entry).
28. • Psychological stress due to non-reconstructive perceptions; possible persistent cognitive effects.
29. • Unpredictable risks; this list cannot be considered complete.
30. Study Design (Summary)
31. • Cohort: n ≤ 4 (initial), with iterative adjustment following safety review.

# Chapter 2: Lara ~ The Corridor

At first, Lara couldn’t believe what she was seeing. There was no other way to explain it: where the door to the janitor’s closet had been just moments ago, there was now nothing but a smooth concrete wall. No frame. Not even the faintest suggestion of a passage.

“Did you hit your head?” she asked herself under her breath.

Maybe she was actually lying unconscious on the floor between cleaning supplies, and all of this was just some incoherent dream.

But the concrete felt real.

The corridor she was standing in was narrow, raw, gray—and so dimly lit that the light did little more than hint at a vague strip of floor in front of her. Slim ceiling lamps hung at regular intervals, each casting only a dull circle of light onto the cement. Between them lay dark stretches where the corridor seemed to disappear entirely.

Slowly, she turned in a full circle. To the left and right, the corridor stretched on endlessly, without windows, without doors, without any point of reference that might tell her where she was. She raised a hand, ran it along the wall, felt the rough surface, the fine dust clinging to her fingertips. She knocked on the concrete—first carefully, then harder. The dull sound made it hard to believe there was a room behind it.

“No… no, this can’t be happening,” she murmured.

The thought came automatically, like a reflex of self-defense. Because she had no explanation.

She turned left and walked a few steps, only to stop again after a few meters. The corridor looked the same in both directions—equally empty, equally cold.

And now?

She forced herself to breathe more slowly. Her mind rattled, desperately searching for a plausible version of reality. Maybe she was just completely overworked. Fourteen hours straight, hardly any breaks, too much coffee—maybe she’d nodded off in the office and was dreaming some kind of bullshit.

She dug her fingernails deep into her forearm. Pain shot through her instantly. Real. Far too real for a dream.

Lara took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and silently counted to five, the way she did when everything at the office felt like it was about to collapse on top of her.

One.  
Two.  
Three.  
Four.  
Five.

When she opened her eyes again, the corridor was still there. Gray. Dull. Endless.

A feeling crept up her spine, cool and insidious. It reminded her of that childhood terror—getting lost between the aisles of a department store and suddenly realizing there was no familiar person in sight.

She leaned her forehead against the wall, closed her eyes again, and tried to listen.

Nothing.

Even the air seemed motionless.

Get a grip. You’re not a child.

The feeling of being watched came without warning. It started as a pressure deep in her stomach and crept up into her chest. She held her breath and slowly turned around.

The light ended after maybe ten meters, swallowed by dense blackness. Beyond that, nothing was visible—and yet it felt as though something was there.

There was no movement. No sound. Just that certainty, that burning prickle on the skin you get when someone is staring at you.

Lara forced herself to look away. This was ridiculous. There was nothing there. There had to be nothing there.

Even so, her muscles stayed tense.

She wrapped her arms around herself to control the shaking and started walking—in the opposite direction.

Walking helped. One step after another. Somewhere, this damn corridor had to end. Even if this place was deeply strange.

An old emergency exit? Fire escape, maybe?

But the longer she walked, the stronger the feeling became that the shadows behind her were growing denser.

She stopped abruptly and spun around.

The corridor looked the same as before. And yet the section that had been visible just moments ago now seemed shorter, as if the darkness had crept closer.

Instinctively, she sped up. Her breathing quickened as she tried to convince herself that none of this could be *real*. Nothing was following her. There was no one there. There was nothing.

And yet the space behind her felt thicker, as though something invisible were pressing forward, closing in without revealing itself.

Then she saw it.

At some distance, something metallic glimmered in the pale light.

Lara stopped.

A door. Finally.

Relief and panic collided inside her at the same time. This was enough adventure for today—for this year, for an entire lifetime. If she got out of here—whatever *here* was—she would get straight into her car, drive home, and tomorrow tell her boss exactly where he could shove his performance review. It was hard to imagine anything more humiliating than being stuck somewhere in a tunnel like this.

The door was heavy, with a handwheel in the center, like the airlock to a maintenance room. It smelled of cold iron.

Maybe this wasn’t even an exit.

For a moment, she considered simply walking past it—onward, always onward, until she found something that clearly meant *out*. But the thought of moving even farther away from the only visible deviation in the endless corridor made her stomach clench.

She raised her hand, hesitated.

Once before, a passage had vanished the moment she used it. What if it happened again? What if she opened this door, stepped through—and everything behind her sealed itself shut, with no way back? What if, instead of an emergency exit, she ended up even deeper in this concrete labyrinth?

While she was still hesitating, the light around her changed. Not dramatically—more like a barely noticeable dimming. But the shadows behind her seemed to stir, as if the already weak light were being swallowed by something drawing closer.

Lara felt herself grow hot and ice-cold at the same time. Sweat gathered beneath her blouse; her neck prickled.

Enough.

She placed both hands on the wheel.

At first, nothing happened. Then the metal gave way with a reluctant crack. The hinge groaned, as though it hadn’t been moved in years, and the door slowly swung open a narrow gap.

A rush of cold air brushed against her—dry and dusty, with a hint of metal.

She stepped through without giving herself time to reconsider, grabbed the edge, and pulled the door shut behind her. The bolt slid into place with a dry, hard slam.

Only then did she let go.

For a long moment, she just stood there, her back against the cold surface, head lowered, her forehead damp with sweat. She focused on her breathing.

Inhale.  
Exhale.

For a moment, everything seemed still.

Then she heard it.

At first, it was so faint she thought she was imagining it.

Right behind the door.

It came again—a sharp, probing scrape, as if something were dragging its fingernails impatiently across the steel.

There was something in that corridor.

The skin on her arms tightened.

What the hell was going on here?

Lara didn’t dare move. She stood so close to the door that she could feel the vibration; each new scrape sent a fine tremor through the metal—and straight into her spine.

Came out of the bedroom this morning to have coffee with my girlfriend before she went to work and I noticed it smelled funny. My mocha pot was on the stove with it on. The handle sitting on the counter melted. 

I go to lift the lid to see what's going on cause I see steam coming from the moca pot. The whole coffee pot is so hot that it's actually plastic still melting. Inside gaskets are probably melted along with the handle.

1. Easy to find parts for a Primula Moka Pot?

I have yet to set everything up as I’ve been working and flying. I’m a student pilot with about 4.5 hours of training. 

I heard there are apps that I can use in-game that I can link with my iPad to I guess have a map or radar of where I’m at? Pardon my ignorance. I also sim race and started doing that 2 years ago and that was a whole journey. It’s sort of the same thing with MSFS and I’m starting at zero but want to give it my all!

I went ahead and grabbed the Aviator Edition, from what I was reading, it was cheaper just to go all out instead of upgrading or buying more planes in game. If I’m wrong, please let me know as I haven’t spent a single minute on steam yet.

But what I really can’t find much about online is the PMDG, if I’m understanding right, are they are 3rd party company that makes super realistic planes and then sells them? And somehow you can import them to the game?

Or does the MSFS have an in-game store where you can purchase it from them on their website? And I understand the gist of buying a cup of coffee, I’ve heard the terminology on peoples Patreon’s or r/photoshoprequests, but is it sometimes a meme here because like, $77 for a custom plane in-game is absurd?

I did look through the FAQ and I have searched PMDG on google/this subreddit, but I’m really non the wiser.

Thank you all so much for any and all help, I really look forward to diving into my first simulator, if it’s even a 3rd as fun as sim racing, I’m in for a wild ride!",0,1766410385.0,MicrosoftFlightSim,6,0.5,False

I quickly developed an appreciation for it and went to my local middle eastern market and picked up a cezve and some Turkish coffee grounds. The cezve I purchased is cheap and I question the safety of it due to the fact that it seems more like a plated material rather than a pure copper/stainless. So, my question for you all is: What cezve do you use and where can you find them for sale? If you're in the USA that would be even better.

# Referral

Amilita plugged her omni-pad into Lady Rakten’s workstand, and noticed how far superior the equipment was to her own even in her Officer’s quarters as she took a position in the middle of the room. Better acoustics, though less armored.

One quick call to Cre’sin later, and the Governess’s recommendation was added to the top of the pile, enough to make Elias’s application move from a strong one to near-unstoppable.

Amilita had enough time while waiting for the next call to answer to contemplate why Lady Rakten had requested to only be attached merely as a rider, one among the many accolades and referrals he had, rather than at the forefront. In exchange, she offered to help with Alic’trian’s Debut, another event that was approaching far too fast for Amilita’s liking. The assistance was a tempting, if puzzling trade that Amilita was sure she was coming out way, way ahead on.

Was it doubt in the boy’s capabilities, should he fail? Or was it driven by respect for his obvious desire to forge his own path? Something about it rubbed Amilita the wrong way, but she respected Lady Rakten too much to assume anything amiss.

This was surely part of some larger plan, and the more she thought about it, the more her request made sense. Nataliska had begun filling out and showing the first hints of real muscle, but she still had so far to go before she looked and acted the part in whole, and Vanguard was not a finishing school for adrifters, stowaways in the cargo hold of civilization.

Such prestigious places were meant to take those who were already ready, whose stars were already rising, and then help elevate them to the next level and ensure they were heading in the correct direction. Elias was a driven individual, but what if he failed out? What would that do to the family reputation, if they backed him with their prestige, only for him to drop?

“General Amilita,” Planetary Governess M’Pravasi’s hologram regarded her caller with an appraising eye. This was their first one-on-one discussion, despite Amilita knowing full well that M’Pravasi had to have been at least appraised of Delaware’s situation by countless unhappy nobles. The Noblewoman almost certainly knew just how politically radioactive the situation was by now, and was happy to distance herself from being seen giving direct any orders, lest the situation continue to spiral.

The Planetary Governess gave a patient, stately gesture to deliver whatever had to be said, and Amilita found her mouth moving before she’d even mentally made the preparation to speak.

“The system hosting Vanguard Academy gets to select a few to send into the class. With so many noblewomen in-system, on and around Earth, the competition for those couple local referral slots is unusually fierce this year.”

M’Pravasi again waved a hand, this time a little quicker, still not deigning to give a response.

The General thumbed her omni-pad to send the prepared referrals, awards, and everything else Elias had bundled into his application. “As everyone knows, your recommendation carries immense weight as to who gets chosen.”

House M’Pravasi’s calendar was stuffed with meeting requests from hopeful applicants, the matriarch certainly at least being wooed with promises of riches like a noble boy at his debut.

A muffled ping through the call marked that the attachments had been received.

“What’s this?” The Governess asked, glancing down at the attachments, eyes skipping over the long list of recommendations from officious-sounding native administrators. The boy had done his legwork.

The General knew she had to keep her pitch as Lesha had described her ideal man: ‘Short and sweet’.

“The one we’re submitting. I’m aware most governesses and generals have submitted one for their own zones, a few feel they have the pull to nominate more than one. However, you get to winnow out the less serious applications, and even add your own referral. I’d think you’ll add your name to this one.”

“And what makes yours stand out?” She asked, raising a skeptical eyebrow.

“I’m also aware that almost all of them will be a shil’vati, and almost none of those men. In-keeping with the peacetime drive for getting more men outside the home and into the services, and serving the uplift program, I’ve decided to submit a young human man.”

“And nothing else?” The ask for a bribe was so brazen, and yet also wholly expected. It hadn’t taken Amilita even a minute to think ahead of what she might have on offer.

“I offer you three dozen visitor passes to Delaware. Individuals of your choice. They will carry my fullest recommendation.” She tapped on the latest tourism brochure that Cre’sin had worked on and sent it across, noting its arrival with another ping.

Delaware was one of, if not the safest place on the planet, and most desirable places through both pleasant weather this time of year and the visitor pass scarcity. Cre’sin had tried to emphasize its authentic human culture in the brochure. M’Pravasi didn’t even give that attachment so much as a glimpse, turning away from the screen’s bright and cheerful display to start staring straight into the camera.

“What else?”

“In addition, we offer to relocate a percentage of our garrison, on loan to other zones.”

That got M’Pravasi’s attention. “It is a relatively small garrison. What percentage?”

“Fifty,” she said. “Deployable in one local months’ time.” Amilita knew she was putting all her faith in the peace holding. If he backstabbed, there wouldn’t be much she could do about it. “But, if you don’t want them…” Amilita was about to try her third offer, when M’Pravasi finally bit.

“It would help,” she admitted, finally paging through the application’s virtual interface with a long and ornately decorated fingernail.

All this to give Alic'trian a Debut that suits him. Was Amilita any better than Governess Bal’shir? She wasn’t so sure anymore.

The General gave a few seconds of silence for the Planetary Governess to review the files, and smiled a little when the elder stateswoman’s eyes widened slightly as she recognized the face on the screen. “I don’t know why I’m surprised,” she muttered. “Why aren’t you asking for the Rakten girl’s sake? Aren’t your families close?”

“She chose to apply independently and has already been accepted.”

In almost no time since the announcement of Vanguard’s arrival, too. Great houses had beggared themselves for less, but Nive had been completely unfazed until a few minutes ago. Perhaps the cost of whatever she’d done to arrange that just hadn’t sunk in.

“And you wish to reunite the lovers, how sweet of you.” M’Prvavasi didn’t quite scoff, one of those noblewoman tricks that delivered the message to the one present, while still giving plausible deniability to any intended slight if ever repeated to its target. “You know the reunification program for humans is ending, right? No more sending people across zones.”

“We’re ending the reunification program?” Amilita asked, gobsmacked. It was one of the most successful ones the planetary government had going, one of the few that was actually popular. Participation had been one of the few things Cre’sin could point to as the state of Delaware cooperating with the imperium’s broader goals, even if the finer details such as the treaty blatantly flew in the face of them. Now they were abandoning that goal, with scarcely any fanfare? Why? “Humanity- sending many back to their points of origin, isn’t that an unfettered good?”

“You are still aiming to rebuild the past, Earth As It Was. We prefer to make Earth As It Could Be. Time only ever moves in one direction, and there is but one humanity, after all.”

That felt…possibly untrue. She’d met many humans of different type and flavor, though she’d not met enough to confidently group them. Even so, humans themselves often told her of differences among them, and the strife it caused. Wasn’t an early learning moment the splitting of the Data Teams expressly to handle the many differences? Those differences had mattered enough to a people conquered just weeks before, they conveyed the lesson to the Shil’vati in blood and lives.

What would M’Pravasi think if she mentioned that? Perhaps she’d dismiss it as stupidity, or a momentary panic.

Still, we undertook no small expenditure, in capital and political terms, and even a few lives to restore their various environments and biomes. If we were just going to make a ‘new’ Earth, with a ‘new’ humanity totally disconnected from its own world, we could have just done that from the start. Something about this proposition ate at her. It was entirely too Ministrivian for her liking, not that she said so while hoping to gain a favor.

There was something in the woman’s tone, too. Something she wanted to poke at. “And what are you basing that belief on?” Amilita asked, mildly.

“A belief, a faith. We are an Empire of one people, after all.”

That wasn’t strictly true either. Or, rather, that had never been true, now that she took a second to process what she just heard.

There was a distinguishable difference in regions. The frontier worlds, the Rim, the Dead Worlds, Dark Systems. One would never confuse any from those with someone from the Developing worlds, or the Core systems.

No one would mistake a commoner for a noble, either. Or a Rakiri from a Shil’vati. The longer she thought on the phrase, the more counterpoints came to her, falling like meteorites on a moon and impacting on her mind as she tried valiantly to rally some kind of rationalization.

It was the Shil’vati Empire, named for more than just its capital world or the common tongue. Where had she heard this line of thinking before? Well, she supposed, finally shutting down the unproductive line of thought. It didn’t really matter. Adding the Rakiri, fugitive Edixi and Nighkru, humanity, and more didn’t add up to a drop in the bucket.

Perhaps there was something to this. For all that they’d tried to curb the Rakiri, Pesrin, and rogue Edixi’s predilection for hunting, it was ultimately a useful trait to have when tracking down a missing item or sniffing out contraband. Those which were useful would remain, what else would be…Amilita shivered and shook again.

Maybe. She had to take orders seriously. To move in the same direction as the Empire. Patriotic pride filled her as she imagined all those disparate parts she’d just identified by their differences, moving as one, in unison. How many wars had been fought between humanity, creating divisions, over where their resources lay? Distribution of them mattered little now in the wake of shil’vati technology and asteroid mining making those ‘rare earth’ materials readily available. Surely, then, this would help ease those divides into irrelevancies. Mankind would be easier to work with, if successful.

If.

“We are,” she conceded instead of voicing this forbidden doubt. Still, it was her duty to point out her misgivings, wasn’t it? “Yet we are governed differently by region, are we not?”

“Minor distinctions. The Empress’s Laws are the Empress’s Laws.”

Far from it, or so Amilita felt. Each system was free to interpret and implement those laws with a wide amount of leeway, though each System Lady did so at her own great risk. The Interior was always hungry.

“All due respect, ma’am, we’re governing a species we have barely begun to really understand. Whose motivations, once understood properly, can bring peace. Now we are to ignore all that we have learned, and…” she wasn’t sure how to close out her sentence with anything close to a respectful tone.

“Do you really imagine your peace will last?” M’Pravasi asked. “Or was a base of operations to operate within the better deal for him, while he expanded his influence? What happens once he has more territory and no longer needs the pretense of your peace? War seems to be their natural state. War, slavery, and shortsightedness.”

Amilita was no diplomat. “Even if true, and I’m not sure that it is, those states he may make war with have not negotiated with him. A few modest concessions, such as banning the mind-wiper, something even Azraea found abhorrent, for example, went a long way.”

“Concessions for temporary peace buy you too little and him too much.”

Are we not a funny picture? A governess arguing for a new war, and I, a General, arguing against.

“Earth has never spread itself across the galaxy. Would it not be easier for us to find a planet of Braxis for Scandinavia, a rimworld for the Americans’ frontier spirit, and so on, rather than seeking to form a single coherent bloc out of all these many peoples?” Such decisions were being made far above her station, yet she wanted to know, or at least get someone at her level to entertain the idea, if she hadn’t already.

M’Pravasi chortled haughtily, as if the idea itself amused her. “No,” she finally answered, then resuming a more professional mask, one she’d let slip just to humiliate the General with her sneer.

“I know you have taken to reading their books. Have you ever watched their fiction? There is a series, a speculative work of their future that they felt they might aspire toward. Is that not our goal, Amilita? To assist them in achieving all they dream to be, rather than what we dream for them? Let them become one, become unified. Let them meld together, their irrelevant distinctions melt away as depicted in their dreams. Besides, it is too late.”

Amilita felt a tingle of anxiety. “It is?”

“Already, we have begun consolidating some of the most irrelevant zones. Did you know some of the nation-states could have been run across by one of your Marines, if properly equipped? The next step will be to find the next easiest, most compatible zones, and then start working to bring them under common administration. We expect the process to take a few months for the Czech Republic and Slovakia to be rejoined, as a trial. It should also simplify matters for the fleet and Naval logistics. Delaware isn’t terribly large, I suppose. Forty five… ‘miles’ wide, a hundred tall? I wonder what might happen to the peace once it is absorbed into its surrounding states’ administrations. Regardless, the ruling humans we have spoken to are enthusiastic to move ahead with this, which is all the permission we need.”

The General felt she could say several things at once.

Of course they’re enthusiastic about it, they try to sound enthusiastic about everything we suggest, no matter how they really feel!

That wasn’t fully true. Some were honest. Terrible things tended to happen to those ones shortly after, though. Which led to her second blurb trying to squeeze itself out from between her tusks.

Their leadership is seen as broadly illegitimate! Their opinion is worthless for anything but a veneer of approval!

But then, what alternative was there she could offer? Finally, the most offensive sentence almost managed it, her mouth opening ever so slightly before years of careful discipline slammed it back shut.

Is that what we’re basing our governance on? Fictional works? Rather than what is, and what we know of them and their capabilities?

Belatedly, Amilita realized the words she’d been teased with were familiar ones, from a speech she’d made when she had been acting as Governess-General. Something about humanity’s ‘dreams of a better future.’

The Planetary Governess cared not a solitary Quarticredit for humanity’s future if it included any actual self-governance. If she did, she could just - aha!

Amilita managed to smile, causing the Planetary Governess to freeze slightly as she realized she’d miscalculated somehow. “Wonderful to hear that we agree. I’d wager then that Elias Sampson, a human, has aspirations of his own, and who are we to stand in the way of a boy with a dream? Let us take a shining example of humanity, and let him achieve for all to see. Surely, your docket has many humans, human boys at that to choose from, but I believe his application is certain to stand as the strongest of them. Word is already travelling on the DataNet of his application.”

The lie landed well. The older woman’s face, for the briefest moment, looked no different to Amilita’s had back when she’d had her first run-in with the Lemon Basil Custard flavor at the new culinary school, one ‘flavor boosted with citrus’. Yet the Governess didn’t want to compound her embarrassment with a noticeable delay.

“Of course,” M’Pravasi started, before frantically correcting her course. “There’s nothing wrong with your suggestion, it is well within your powers. Stellar grades.” She managed to actually page through the pile she’d skipped reading before, digging for something in there to object to. “A list of recommendations from the new holders of seats of power, are those considered valid in your state?”

“As well as their former holders,” Amilita said. “He recognizes our power.”

“Vacated via the sham of a process you erringly legitimize, yet doesn’t cause an awkwardness by snubbing those who were installed.”

M’Pravasi paused, and then let Amilita summarize: “Smart kid.”

“So it would seem.”

“I am glad to hear you agree with my sentiment, and assessment. He has survived difficulties. Endured alone, despite my earlier insistence that he accept our aid in his safety. He hid during the conflict, shows physical prowess, a great deal of promise, and has demonstrated he can follow orders.” She decided to not mention all the times he also chose not to.

His only mistake in the end was trusting us. I have to make that up to him. I must.

“Sounds far too independent,” sniffed M’Pravasi.

“He will drive humanity toward all that they can be,” countered Amilita, sticking with her original line of attack. “And he is undergoing final preparations under Lady Rakten herself. So, if there are no objections…?” The woman clearly tried to think of some, but couldn’t conjure one in the heartbeat of time that Amilita gave her. “...Excellent, then I’m glad I can count on your support, as well. The application has been sent, along with the personal blessings of Houses Cre’sin, Rakten, and even our base’s local Interior Officer. In addition, we have attached the Service Moon Medal as well as some more local awards for heroism in the face of danger. We would be disappointed if you would not add your name to the list of referrals.”

The Governess might still refuse, find some way to refuse the application if she decided this was too offensive, but then she’d find herself explaining herself to House Cre’sin, Rakten and possibly even the Interior all at once.

Rare as it was for the two adversarial factions to work together, the results were often spectacularly unpleasant for whoever was hapless enough to align the Interior and Nobility against herself. Amilita might find the next woman in M’Pravasi’s seat a bit more amenable to her little arrangement in Delaware, as well as future suggestions its General might make.

“Just one question.”

“Yes, ma’am?” Amilita remained polite, despite all.

“Where is he now?”

# Training Exercise

I’d expected to be treated with an unspoken reluctance from Lady Rakten and Morsh, sort of ‘business as usual’ for me. An unwelcome tagalong to the true intended target of their training. Someone whose presence was to be suffered, an annoyance in her eye that she would even had to suffer the ‘inferior’ sex’s presence. Whether we boys were seen as a disruptive nuisance, or an inferior to be ‘taught’ by our ‘betters’, treatment from the bureaucratic system had largely been monotonous and predictable.

So it was quite a surprise when they insisted that training start immediately while Amilita made use of their office to lend her weight to my application, and Lady Rakten took some time to create a lesson.

Morsh even seemed to instead be…gentler with me. Much gentler. Then it clicked into place. Ah. She saw me like I was a defective girl who couldn’t sit still or do basic tasks without annoyance. Preemptive remedial training. Quite like Talay, then. The only difference being that I could literally run laps around Natalie.

Now the hulking bodyguard had one finger raised as she lectured me, trying to pick my brain with the simplest of combat scenarios, while my girlfriend watched silently but attentively, a few feet closer to the house.

“Alright. You had a knife on you, and you surprised me with it. Whatever nonsense someone else fills your head with, remember these words: That was the right thing to do at the time since I knew you were a boy, and it wasn’t a war. But on the battlefield, if you show your enemy that you’re willing and ready to fight instead of possibly submitting quietly, then they’ll prepare accordingly for what you’ve shown you have. Even if you get the stab on one, they might have friends. And then you’ll lose. So, let’s pretend we’re a pair of infantry. We’re meeting in an open field, vegetation stripped, craters everywhere. Your lasgun is disabled. You don’t know if I have troops behind me. What do you do?”

This was worse than Talay. At least there, I could teach myself from the manual, and the actual lesson at hand was boring material I already knew. If I was going to learn much of anything, I’d need her to pick up the pace.

She stared me down, as if daring me to challenge the idea that I could take her on for a second round and prove her point.

To counter her point, I had killed a commando, and a Marine in close quarters combat. I was in ideal situations in both cases, though: One hadn’t been trying to kill me until it was far too late, and the other was tired from the charge across the open field and then marching up the hill to Camp Death, her wireless targeting system disrupted by Radio’s jammer. Could I take on Morsh? Hand to hand?

“You’re thinking behind those eyes. I can see it. Come on, spill it.”

If I challenged Morsh, I’d have to try and kill her. What good came of that, if I succeeded? So instead of going for the knife in my pocket, I bent down and picked up a dried out little twig, and held it like a practice knife, rolled it over my fingers clumsily, getting the weight of it- and then gripped it by the ‘hilt’ and slashed up with the bark-encrusted ‘blade’, aiming right for her throat. It was a quick and sudden motion.

I almost made contact, too, before my shoulder jarred like I’d mishandled a parkour roll from her flat palm strike. I staggered, and she grabbed me by the wrist to keep me from toppling back over with her other hand. Her fierce golden eyes glared into mine, until she sniffed out through her nostrils and reset her balance. “Close,” she admitted, not releasing my wrist. “But now what?”

“...I suppose my arm is broken, next,” I hazarded a guess. I knew she could do it, too. Easily, with a casual motion. Faster than Natalie might jump in to try and save me. I tried to twist so that at least my elbow might at least bend if she pushed, only to feel the socket in my shoulder protest when she turned it against the way I’d moved. I let go of the stick.

Morsh grinned, and then released me, speaking a little louder. “If you try that up there- they will snap a bone for trying that on an instructor. They might even shatter a joint, just to lengthen recovery times, and let you lose all your beauty sleep from the phantom pain. They had me re-set my leg as a painful learning lesson, and a way to teach field medicine all rolled into one. Nerves and connective tissues have to regrow and reattach themselves, after all. It’s not pleasant.”

I rubbed my wrist and glared silently.

“I get that it’s a fighting spirit you have, and a point to prove. You’re ‘not like the other boys’, right? We have a lot more training to do today, and don’t have time for you to learn these lessons the slow way, and I don’t wanna have to talk over your screaming. So drop the ego, the tough-boy act, and start using your head.”

“Alright.” I would have to be a bit smarter. Follow orders, but find my own way to excel, and show at least the Raktens they hadn’t made a mistake in backing my application.

“Morsh? Where did you fight? You tell me a lot about what happened, how you got the drop on someone, or how you killed them, but never really where they happened,” Natalie finally butted in to ask.

“Kid, I fought in wars that don’t even have a name.”

—----

Morsh wanted to really ‘toughen us up.’ That was the top priority, interspersed with impromptu lessons on military life while she parried her teenaged ward’s blows with one hand, then circling around to give me my fair share of lumps.

When I found a spare moment to track them down, I was going to have words for the pair of spooks that had put me up to this. Oh, they were going to pay.

Worse, a lot of this was roughly analogous to a situation I’d literally asked for. How often had I almost begged Gavin and Sullivan to let me attend our own insurgent training to see if that was the problem with our expansion efforts?

They’d always deflected, and then insisted that Emperor visibly struggling to complete basic fitness would be of no benefit to morale, nor would people behave as-normal, ruining any other value. When I said it wouldn’t be an issue, they assured me it would be tougher than I thought.

Then I suggested maybe a round of going maskless, a small cell that would be expected to operate together.

In turn they pointed out attending Undercover Boss as Elias Sampson with live fire exercises was an even worse idea. Even a generic mask was out of the question, not just because ‘something might happen’ but also because I’d be pulled from the program at the end instead of sent in, and that would almost certainly sow mistrust within the squad I’d have joined for training purposes.

All very sound reasons to turn me down, but this was too easy. Too soft. At least, it had been in the beginning.

Morsh had taken some exception to my dragging up the unpleasant memory of fileting her arm, and had taken hand-to-hand as an opportunity to wallop Natalie and me in ways I doubted their mother would allow under any other circumstance.

“Elias! The enemy has a compound shield and you are leading a half-pod of survivors, three of which are injured, you got the rest killed. First action?”

What in the hell were they preparing me for up there?

“Attack.” I knew the question was a drill to see if I’d freeze up or beg for more information to stall, as I sometimes did conversationally. The Shil’vati didn’t end up the largest faction in the known galaxy by only playing defense, after all.

“Attack how?”

“Close distance,” I said, coming toward her, trying to break her guard. “Break through the Emitter’s Shield Zone. If we took casualties then we’re between-”

“Wrong,” she cut me off and rebuffed me with a sweeping forearm that I had to block by the time I recognized it was coming, and still hit with enough force to set me on my heels. “If you took casualties, and you got them killed, odds are that you are already past the shield. Describe the shield zone.”

“A block long,” I recited. “Lasbolts reduced to about a similar penetration zone. Used to protect infrastructure from flying ships. Fortifies-” she swung at me, the move telegraphed in extremely slow motion, before picking up the pace as I showed that I got the idea.

“Keep going!” She barked.

“-Fortifies an…area…” doing both was really difficult. I dodged a follow-up strike, again, choreographed, but faster this time. “Sort of like a dome? I don’t-”

WHAP she got me by the back of the head as I’d lost focus on the fight and I rubbed the spot she’d gotten me as she stood over top, offering me a hand up. “We keep going. Come on, get on your feet.”

When I was apparently too slow she crouched down and pulled me upright, staring me right in the face. “How much time do you think you have to cover history, civics, and get your physique up to par? Most of the cadets will have private bodyguards to train them, only with far more time.”

“Lasbolts operate at reduced range in the shield zone, which usually guard not just infrastructure,” I said, recalling what I’d been told, and taking a more ready stance. Morsh studied my pose, then gave an experimental reach, and I batted it aside. “They also protect lascannons which can prevent orbital bombardments.” This time she was quicker, more forceful. She wasn’t kidding about moving me up to speed, it seemed. “They’re usually deployed in a dome shape, enormous, but can be shrunken down to make a more guardable perimeter in the event of a siege.” I’d have to get the hang of this. 

“Magnetic spheres, size of an office building, basically, and they also generate ozone around an area. Someone figured out that they worked to reduce-”

“And?” Morsh asked, interrupting Natalie, this time swiping almost at what I’d call ‘full speed.’ It would be hard to parry, so I let it sail past and ducked under it, stepping in until she was forced to take a step back and try to open the range. I didn’t let her, staying on the attack that I’d said I’d mounted.

“And the attack,” I recalled. “The wounded will either be captured or killed with us if we fail, or treated once we have won a beachhead. There’s no point staying put, slowing our advance to treat them if we’re out in the open. There’s usually a killing field around the perimeter.”

I remembered how the shil’vati had left their wounded laying in the open field on the attack. Once we’d started using the railguns to pierce the little shelter bunkers they’d set down and made it clear there was no cover, the wounded were picked up on the retreat- but they’d made a point to not be slowed down by stopping for the injured and maimed.

Shame that even there, on their beachhead they’d found no safety, not when the white phos-

WHAP

I’d let myself get distracted again.

This time I saw stars and blinked, barely managing to catch myself.

“Wrong answer,” she sneered. “You can’t close the distance in time, you’ll only arrive tired.” I hadn’t been aggressive or fast enough, in other words, and I should have persevered through the possibility of the trap. Our eyes met and she realized I knew it had been a trap.

“A Shil’vati might,” I answered. “I wouldn’t.”

“Prove it, then. Up, go. Wall, and back. Then go stick it to that dummy with lethal enthusiasm, and then I’ll test whatever’s left of you. Go on, go! Natalie, you’re up!”

I took off, legs churning through the tall grass.

\*\*\*\*\*

Ten minutes after that, and I bit down another curse as I struggled to slap back together a basic, standard-issue lasrifle. The self-expanding, or otherwise magnetized rivet was spinning on the table around and around, instead of fastening itself through some act of metallurgy or energization I hadn’t had the opportunity to ask about yet.

I wasted a quarter second staring at the slippery little wayward piece, feeling a weird sort of kinship. Here I was toiling away and not going anywhere, distinctly out of place. The difference was, I was master of my own destiny, wasn’t I? So why was I sitting here, in an open field, with a lasrifle and alien watching over me when I could just slap it in and finish bolting it together, march right over to those assholes who’d set me up and-

“The cylinder goes inside the hole. You’ll never make it as a boyfriend if you can’t figure that out.”

I picked it up and slid it in, then resisted the urge to bash her with it, or else poke a red hot hole right between the eyes once I was done.

“You seem a lot better at taking it apart than you are at putting it back together.”

In the earliest days, rapidly stripping off the valuable parts in a neutral, semi-secluded area was an essential skill in not getting caught, and even then we still stowed the pieces and parts in faraday cages.

It wasn’t until we captured all the hostages in bulk that we got surprisingly forthrightly given lessons on what equipment usually did and didn’t have a tracker. Even so, reassembly was something new.

“Yeah. Things are always a lot easier to break than they are to fix.” I looked over at Natalie. Had we fully patched up our relationship, really, since I’d revealed who I was? There were moments I wasn’t so sure.

I mean, I couldn’t blame her for having difficulty looking past it. I didn’t want to dismiss her doubts as something she’d adjust to, get used to, but on the other hand I wasn’t going to exactly set this aside as readily as I did the lasgun I’d half-distractedly managed to finish reassembling.

It was a strange mix of modular and serviceable, and the captive Marines had been oddly helpful in helping me and the others dissect the technology. “Decades out of date but the military keeps refusing the upgrades.”

“Why?” I asked.

She seemed surprised at my question, then shrugged after a little moment of thought. “Lots of reasons. Sometimes they are good ones.”

“Not as repairable, and the Marines refuse it,” Natalie called out. “Or if there is a competitor that pops up and is, they get bought out by the current contract holder, and their project gets spun down. Poof. No more contract.”

Likely, the nobles were the ones with the existing contract. In those few cases where they weren’t, it would be pretty easy to stop them. Barring a marriage of convenience, of course, where an ambitious family might marry a Noble, then little could get in their way.

“Wouldn’t the nobles usually- ah.”

I realized I was staring at Natalie, and then the large, multi-domed, purple-hued house behind her, then over at Morsh, their live-in bodyguard who made even other Shil’vati marines quake in fright.

Natalie had said her father was the one with the money, some sort of terraforming business that occasionally brought him to Mars.

“Why would the other noblewomen put up with that?” I finally managed a reasonable question to ask. “Or the Interior?”

“They don’t always. But LightArma started spreading out the manufacture of the components to dozens of major sectors. Dispersal is better to prevent one system falling to an enemy raid, and logistics are spread, but that also means retooling is expensive.”

Expensive. I’d never considered the Empire’s economy, ever. Their resources seemed limitless. How couldn’t they, when they thought it economical to hurl millions of soldiers at us from half a galaxy away? When a rechargeable charge pack no bigger than a first aid kit could contain enough power to shatter a building? When the power plants they’d plonked down over the cratered remains of ours had no emissions?

“And so the Shil’vati only makes one rifle?”

“Do my rifles look like that?” Morsh asked, gesturing at the one I'd finally finished putting back together. I supposed none of the ones I'd seen her with had the same characteristic boxy appearance of the one in front of me. I supposed not winning the contract didn’t mean there wasn’t a more limited form of success that could be achieved. Still, all this likely meant something, I just wasn't sure what, yet. I didn't have enough pieces of the puzzle to put it all together. “Besides. This is just a recent problem. I’m sure the Crown, Nobles, or Interior will put a stop to it, eventually. There’s just other issues that need dealing with first.”

I gave a small nod. “Sure. Like what?”

“And- break!” Morsh announced. “You’ve got an annoying habit of asking really hard questions, you know that?”

“It’s a skill of his,” Natalie agreed, walking up and holding her rifle out proudly in the glistening sun.

Then the charge pack fell out.

1psz983,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brightline/comments/1psz983/i_wont_ever_ride_again/,I won’t ever ride again,"Did a Miami to Orlando round-trip last week.

This was for a work trip. So I didn’t really feel like driving/flying and work was ok spending the Brightline ticket-fare. 

First train was OK, smooth experience. On time, didn’t order any food/drink, drove and parked at the parking garage. 

The return, was simply a nightmare. The app switched my return trip from 11am to 8am… when I got there at my normally scheduled time, there was a line of dozens of passengers with the same problem. No explanation via the app. Just the wrong time, stating that we were now on an 8am train (which already passed).

Customer service had a horrible time explaining to everyone what was going on. It was actually quite comical. Apparently one of the trains had mechanical issues and was out of service, which meant my new departure was 12:30pm… fine, whatever.

Once passed thru the chaos of pre-security, I ordered a 7$ latte from the bar that tastes like burnt coffee beans. Had to throw it out. 

Once boarded the delayed train, I ordered a snack and a new coffee. 20mins go by… no one brings me it… 30mins… eventually at the 45 minute mark since placing my order, I have to go find an attendant to get my overpriced shitty coffee and bag of chips. 

Cherry on top is that even tho I validated parking in the parking garage, it wasn’t letting me pay. It’s like my plate wasn’t registered at all (even tho I have a screenshot from Parking.com) saying it was parked. The QR codes to pay weren’t functioning. I eventually just drove off and out of the garage. Now wondering who to call or what type of bill I may receive in the mail. 

Brightline is supposed to be easier than flying. With no delays or issues. The “easy” experience was definitely not had. Driving is almost always the cheaper option. You’re PAYING for a stress free experience where you can enjoy your time.

I did not. 

I won’t do it again for either business or personal. ",0,1766409210.0,Brightline,5,0.44,False

This is the Acafe with the physical buttons, not the Acafe plus with the touch screen.  It is on Amazon now, but I don't see it on the Casabrews website.  Maybe the plus has already replaced it??

Overall, I'm happy with it.  It is my first automatic and 2nd espresso machine.  I think it produces reasonably good espresso without a lot of mess and fuss - which is all I really want.  I've been using relatively inexpensive beans while I blow through them figuring things out, but I still get a pretty good cup.  If we get a warm spell I'll have to get back to roasting my own beans for a really good test.  Even though I roast beans, I am not very fussy about my coffee and espresso.  I do like a smooth, chocolaty brew though.

I haven't played with the settings much, but then there are only a few things that can be changed.  I've added a couple of clicks to grind finer since the pucks (such as they are) seemed a little loose at the factory setting.  I've also switched to the lowest dose size.  It didn't seem to make any obvious difference in my lattes, so I've stuck with it for them.

The things I don't like pertain to the cleaning.  It runs a cleaning cycle at startup and shutdown which I've gotten used to, but it also semi-randomly forces a manual cleaning cycle and/or waste bin cleaning - always right after my shot and before I froth my milk, which is super annoying.  I guess I could/should froth first though.  

The other thing is that the waste bin is a super messy affair because the water from the post shot cleaning and cleaning cycles runs through the puck tray.  It creates a thick sludge in that tray and washes a lot of grounds into the liquid tray below it.  My kitchen drain isn't up to the level of grounds I'd have in it if I just rinsed out everything that sticks to the trays, so I've been working on that.  Lining the puck tray with a coffee filter seems to work well.  I had some filters around that happen to be just about the right size.  They work even though they aren't in the right shape.  I think they are standard 6-8 cup basket filters (\~3.5"" bottom, 2.5"" sides, about 6"" across the top).  Of course when I need more, I'll get the cheapest ones I can find.

I am stuck on what to do or if I should pursue her.,"I've been on SR for about a month now. We had our fist hangout Friday. In the beginning she seemed a little hostile and nervous of me but after an hour when we got coffee. Our conversations were flowing and we honestly began to have the time of our lives just talk and walking around in the park along with heading to a shopping center and walking around. After 7 hours or so of us being together.. we began to hug on each other. Hold hand and everything. It felt so good, then right when I dropped her off we had our fist kiss and everything seemed so well. I HAVENT EVEN HAD SEXUAL THOUGHTS HAVING SEX OR DOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT WITH HER. (That is rare and very important) most women I would try to sleep with. Fast forward last night I picked her up to go eat and it got awkward and weird. The next thing I know she ends up talking to her sister on the phone and she tells her to pick her up after me driving her to the restaurant we're gonna go to. Later on she called me telling her that she was thinking about some stuff and apparently she said she doesn't like the way I talk how assertive I am and how I'm just very bold with my words, but I never ever disrespected her. I called her out her name or yell at her or anything. When I got back to my place, she called me and she acted fine and then randomly she said that the reason why she left is because she was scared of me. That's I'm aggressive in the way I speak. I've never gotten that before.. then she goes and tells me about all the traumatic stuff that happened to her in her past relationships understand and that it reminds her of the past things . But I never said anything disrespectful to her. We literally bond have had great chemistry, I was such in my masculinity and she was so feminine when we had our first date. It felt very real and organic. I never had a female say they are scared of me. I have done SR before, way longer then 30 days and had dates with women. But with this woman, I never had her tell me this. I'm just here to vent and ask what should I do? We talked it out and she basically sounded like she was ok after we talked it out for a long time on the phone. But initially spoke as if she hated who I was. She's acting like we've been together for a long time. I just don't know what to do. Idk if she is a gir that's fit for me to be on SR with, her family is terribly destroyed but I disregard that because the love she offers. But she is very negative at times with things.

1psyzl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1psyzl9/never_ending_loop/,Never ending loop,"I’m afraid I’m going to drown in this loop forever. I’ve been limerent for over eight years for someone who was once my professor.

I knew I had this intense crush the moment I stepped into his classroom but I never acted on it as a student. A year after I graduated college though, I reached out to him simply to tell him how much I had enjoyed his teaching. He responded with gratitude, and I assumed that would be the end of it. I didn’t expect anything more to come from it, though I did choose to follow him on social media afterward. For a year or two, I interacted anonymously, replying to his posts and engaging casually. It felt fun and light. We connected on several things and I convinced myself there was a special connection since he didn’t know it was me. 

Eventually I revealed who I was, and things escalated. At first it was innocent sending of posts to each other that we thought the other would like, but it quickly became sexual. I was deep in limerence by then. Looking back now, it’s clear he likely enjoyed the attention and the validation. When I confessed that I wanted to see him, he rejected me politely, but expressed how much he liked me. 

I felt angry and embarrassed. Angry because the connection I believed we had existed mostly in my head, and embarrassed because I put myself in a situation I sensed was unhealthy but couldn’t stop. Despite this, we continued interacting online. We flirted, sometimes sexted. I obsessively checked my phone for messages, and when he replied, the dopamine hit was intense. Writing this now, it’s obvious that the constant availability that I offered made it so easy for him to take advantage of.

Eventually, things escalated further. We planned to meet at a hotel and shared what we wanted sexually. I wanted it to mean more, even though I knew it was only sexual for him. I was willing to do things I normally wouldn’t because I wanted him so badly. Before leaving the hotel, he told me this could never happen again. I think the guilt was getting to him so I agreed pretending that this was all casual and fun for me. 

I thought about that day in the hotel room for years afterward.

For a while after, we barely spoke. I tried to be casual, to match his distance, but internally I was burning. I was willing to hurt myself emotionally if it meant receiving even a small amount of attention from him. The distance eventually grew and there was a period when I thought I was finally moving on. I met other people, often gravitating toward men who shared similar traits, hoping that would help. It worked briefly, but eventually I fell back into the same loop. I would be thinking about him constantly, hoping he would notice me again.

The gaps between messages grew longer, sometimes months. I began to accept that I would likely never see him again, and that acceptance felt freeing for a time. Then after almost a year or two of barely any contact he started messaging me again. He was warm, curious, attentive. I told myself it meant nothing, but I was immediately pulled back in. Now it seems clear that he may have been going through a crisis and wanted an ego boost, and he knew exactly where to find it.

He told me he was thinking about me and that I was on his mind, while also saying he didn’t want to use me. I think he knew he was using me, and at that point, I didn’t resist. Limerence feels like a sickness. You can know something is harmful and still want it with your entire being.

A few months ago, we met again. From his side, it felt unromantic, and I tried hard to mirror that. We met a few times just to talk and catch up. The conversations were personal. He told me he was in therapy, and we discussed sexual interests and things we were curious about. He wanted to meet me for one night again after almost 5 years from our hotel meet and I approached it with a sense of “if I’m going to do this, I may as well be honest,” even requesting things I normally wouldn’t. The situation felt taboo from the beginning, so I leaned into that.

The experience itself was intense and unforgettable, and the dopamine rush was overwhelming. What stays with me most, though, is that we held each other that night while sleeping. That moment felt like bliss. Like I had been waiting seven years for it and I didn’t want the night to end.

In the morning, he was distant. I offered coffee or breakfast but he declined. He seemed eager to leave, polite but emotionally closed off. Since then, he’s been purposefully cold and largely unresponsive. I tell myself I’m okay with it, because there’s nothing else I can do but accept it.

What I struggle with most is that despite understanding everything now and despite seeing how one sided and harmful this was my mind is still drawn to him. I feel sick over it. I want to stop thinking about him so I can move on, but whenever I’m with someone else or something reminds me of him, he comes rushing back. It’s insane to be aware that someone doesn’t want you, yet your mind and body refuse to let go.

I feel pathetic and weak willed. I want, desperately, to escape this limerent loop that I know I put myself into. ",6,1766408418.0,limerence,3,1.0,False

My caseworker - a tired woman with kind eyes and perpetually coffee-stained files - suggested I write about what happened. She used words like ""processing"" and ""healing,"" as though trauma were a wound that closes rather than a scar that deepens. Still, I made a promise, and in the smoking wreckage of my former life, promises are among the few structures still standing.

So here it is. All of it.

It was an ordinary Monday, which is how all transformations begin - not with thunder, but with the mundane clicking of a coffee maker and the smell of garlic browning in olive oil.

Mom stood at the kitchen counter, layering ricotta and noodles with the methodical precision she brought to everything, humming ""How Great Thou Art"" under her breath. The same hymn. Always the same hymn. She had this gift for making our house feel like the gravitational center of something larger, as though beyond our walls the universe spun in chaos, but within them, order prevailed. The singing, however, had long since crossed from comforting to oppressive - a soundtrack that played on an infinite loop until you stopped hearing the words and only felt their weight.

Dad occupied his study, the door half-open, his reading glasses perched on his nose as he bent over Sunday school materials. He was our household's quiet authority, never loud, never harsh, but immovable as granite when decisions required making. He didn't shout to establish dominance; he simply existed as the final word, the hammer that fell when Mom's gentleness proved insufficient.

Emma sprawled across the living room floor in her typical configuration - belly-down, colored pencils scattered around her like prayer offerings, drawing another iteration of her endless angel series. At eleven, she retained that crystalline innocence that adults remember existing but can never quite recapture. She believed in goodness the way others believe in gravity: absolutely, unquestioningly, as fundamental law rather than hopeful theory.

And then there was me. Thirteen years old, constantly watching, constantly cataloging discrepancies. Perhaps that's why I survived - because I noticed things others dismissed as irrelevant static in the signal of normal family life.

Things like the Friday night transformations.

Mom and Dad would disappear into their bedroom and emerge dressed in clothes that seemed borrowed from different people entirely - outfits that made Mom look like she'd rewound a decade, that stripped Dad of his pastoral gravitas and revealed something younger, hungrier beneath. They called these excursions ""Bible study"" or ""prayer meetings,"" returning late with flushed cheeks, disheveled hair, and a looseness in their movements that whispered of wine and secrets. Once, sorting laundry - because in our house, children performed chores as moral education - I discovered a business card tucked in Dad's shirt pocket.

""The Garden Club.""

No website. An address that led nowhere on Google Maps. A phone number that rang endlessly into void without even the mercy of voicemail.

I called it three times. Three times, silence.

That Monday evening, after Emma had been tucked into bed with her usual protests about staying up ""just five more minutes,"" I descended the stairs for water and caught the tail end of their kitchen conversation.

""They're asking about this weekend."" Mom's voice carried an edge of excitement I recognized - the same tone she used when planning something she knew was slightly transgressive.

""I don't know, Sarah."" Dad's reluctance sounded performative, the resistance of someone already defeated. ""After what happened last time with the Millers...""

""That was different. These are good people. Very... discreet.""

The word hung in the air like smoke.

Dad sighed his capitulation sigh. ""Fine. But we need to be more careful about the ki - ""

They saw me.

The conversation died mid-syllable.

I played my part: the oblivious child seeking hydration, pretending I hadn't heard their secret language. Mom's smile arrived too quickly, too bright, her blue eyes gleaming with manufactured warmth.

""Honey, Dad and I might have a church leadership retreat this weekend. Would you be okay watching Emma for a night?""

I nodded. I'd watched Emma before. Their ""retreats"" had become part of our family's texture, peculiar threads woven into otherwise ordinary fabric. We went to New Life Community Church every Sunday without fail. We prayed before meals with heads bowed and hands clasped. Thursday nights meant board games and laughter around the dining table. We were the prototype Christian family, the kind that prompted church elders to smile approvingly and say, ""Now there's how it's done.""

What I didn't understand then - what I couldn't understand - was that Monday marked the first tremor before everything collapsed.

Later that evening, while struggling through pre-algebra homework that felt monumentally pointless, I noticed the porch light flickering. Not the irregular sputter of a dying bulb or the brownout flicker of overtaxed circuits, but something rhythmic. Deliberate.

On. Off. On. Off.

Everyone was inside. I verified this fact twice before approaching my second-floor window.

Below, shadows moved across our front lawn with unnatural fluidity, stretching and contracting in synchronization with each pulse of light. They looked almost liquid, pooling and receding like dark water responding to invisible tides.

""Dad?"" My voice carried down the stairs. ""The porch light is doing something weird.""

I heard him rise from his chair - the particular creak of leather that meant he'd been reading, not working - followed by footsteps toward the kitchen where the front window offered clear sight lines.

""Huh."" He sounded genuinely puzzled. ""That is strange.""

He checked the breaker box first, conducting the investigation with his typical methodical approach. Then he ventured outside to examine the bulb itself, unscrewing and reseating it with the confidence of someone who'd done minor repairs for decades. By the time he finished, the light had stabilized, glowing steady and unremarkable.

""Just a power surge,"" he called up to me, but his voice carried doubt like an undertone beneath the words.

That night, I heard him check the doors. All of them. Twice.

The locks clicked with unusual finality.

Mom's voice woke me - sharp, strained, carrying an anxiety that immediately set my nerves firing.

""James, where's the Bible? Our Bible?""

The family Bible lived on their nightstand. Always. It was one of those constants you stop questioning, like the sun rising or water running downhill. Leather-bound, heavy enough to require two hands, its cover embossed with our names and birthdates in gold leaf that caught the light.

""I didn't move it."" Dad's response came clipped, tense, his usually controlled demeanor showing stress fractures.

What followed sounded like controlled demolition - cushions launched from couches, drawers yanked open and slammed shut, their systematic search growing increasingly frantic. Emma and I emerged from our rooms to find them tearing through the house with an intensity that seemed vastly disproportionate to a missing book.

""Why not just use one of the other Bibles?"" I suggested, gesturing toward the living room bookshelf where we kept at least five different translations.

Mom wheeled on me. ""It's not just any Bible. It's *our* Bible.""

The emphasis on that possessive pronoun - the way it transformed an article into an identity - made me wonder what that particular volume contained beyond scripture. What margin notes had they written? What documents had they pressed between pages? What made it irreplaceable beyond mere sentiment?

We never found it.

That night, I woke to use the bathroom and heard them arguing in fierce whispers that carried through walls like smoke.

""Things don't just disappear, James.""

""I know that, Sarah, but what exactly are you suggesting?""

""I'm saying our Bible didn't grow legs and walk away.""

Silence.

Then: ""We'll talk about this tomorrow.""

But they didn't. The Bible's absence became a pocket of silence in our household conversation, something acknowledged only through careful avoidance.

Wednesday morning, Mom stood in the living room making a sound I'd never heard from her - a keening whimper of distress that pulled me from sleep like a physical force.

Every plant in our house was dead.

Not wilting. Not drooping. *Dead.* Desiccated to the point of looking archaeological, as though they'd been excavated from ancient tombs rather than living on our windowsills yesterday. Mom's prized African violets - plants she'd nursed for seven years, speaking to them while she watered - had turned to brittle husks. The bathroom ferns hung like dried seaweed. Even the snake plant in the entryway, that supposedly indestructible survivor, had collapsed into itself.

Several had been uprooted entirely, their root systems exposed, dirt scattered across surfaces in patterns that looked almost intentional.

""Did you do this?"" Mom's voice shook as she interrogated Emma and me, her hands trembling.

Emma's eyes filled immediately. ""No! I would never hurt your plants, Momma!"" The tears came in earnest now, her small body wracked with sobs at being accused of such cruelty.

Mom pulled her close, but over Emma's head, she exchanged a look with Dad that I couldn't parse. Fear? Recognition? Both?

""What is happening?"" she whispered later when they thought we couldn't hear.

Dad checked his phone that evening, scrolling through weather data with unusual focus.

""Oh, I nearly forgot."" His voice carried forced casualness. ""There's a blood moon tomorrow.""

Emma perked up from her homework. ""What's a blood moon?""

""It's when the moon looks red during a lunar eclipse."" Dad explained in his teacher voice, the one he used for Sunday school. ""Sometimes it's interpreted as a sign of impending judgment. In the Book of Joel, it's described as a harbinger of the end times."" He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. ""Nothing to worry about, though. They happen every couple of years.""

Beneath the table, I watched him take Mom's hand and squeeze until her knuckles whitened. Both closed their eyes.

A prayer, I assumed.

Thursday passed without incident until darkness fell and the blood moon rose.

We'd gathered for game night as usual - Monopoly, because Emma loved it despite its capacity to stretch for hours - but none of us could focus on Baltic Avenue or Boardwalk. The moon hung in the eastern sky like an open wound, casting everything in shades of rust and crimson.

We didn't need electric lights. The entire house glowed red.

Emma pressed against Dad's side, seeking comfort from the otherworldly illumination. He wrapped an arm around her, murmuring reassurances, but I watched shadows on the walls stretch and writhe in ways that defied geometry. They moved independently of their objects, sliding across surfaces with liquid intention.

I lay awake long after we abandoned the game, watching my ceiling transform into a canvas for impossible shapes. The red light made everything look like it was coated in old blood.

I did not sleep well.

Emma's scream pulled me from uneasy dreams like a fishhook in flesh - sudden, violent, undeniable.

I reached the front door before my conscious mind fully engaged, still wearing pajamas, my heart already hammering against my ribs.

Emma stood frozen, staring at our doorstep.

The door hung slightly ajar - not kicked in, not forced, just... open. As though it had been gently, politely pushed aside.

On our porch lay an arrangement.

Three bass - freshwater fish, their scales still wet, their eyes glazed but somehow not quite empty. They formed the vertical line of a cross. The horizontal came from a cardinal, its neck snapped at a precise angle, red feathers bright against wood grain, wings spread as though in flight.

Someone had positioned them with care. This wasn't random violence but deliberate composition.

The bass came from Lake Morrison, two miles away, where Dad and I fished on summer afternoons. The cardinal was Mom's favorite bird - she'd told us countless times how they reminded her of Grandpa, how seeing them felt like receiving messages from heaven.

Whoever left this knew us.

""Don't touch anything."" Dad appeared behind us in his bathrobe, his face the color of old newspaper. He ushered us back inside with hands that trembled despite his attempts at steadiness.

I watched from the window as he disposed of the animals, moving mechanically, as though his body had automated the process while his mind retreated somewhere safer. When he returned, Mom waited with coffee, her hands shaking so badly the cup rattled against the saucer.

""Who would do this?"" Tears cut tracks through her makeup.

""I don't know."" Dad's voice carried rage - the cold fury of a man whose family has been targeted.

""This is sick!"" I couldn't contain my anger. ""Whoever did this is fucked up!""

""Language,"" Dad warned automatically, but his heart wasn't in the correction.

That night, I listened to them through the heating vents.

""We need to call the police."" Mom's voice, straining toward hysteria.

""It could just be teenagers."" Dad's response sounded like he was trying to convince himself. ""Some awful, disgusting prank, but still just a prank.""

""They killed those animals, James.""

""I know. I know. But..."" A long pause. ""Let's make a deal. If anything else happens - anything at all - we call the police immediately. But right now, without evidence, without knowing who or why...""

He didn't finish the thought.

I wanted to go downstairs, to add my voice to Mom's, to insist on police and protection and answers. But something kept me in bed, clutching the cross necklace I'd worn since confirmation, as though it were a ward against darkness rather than a symbol of faith.

Some instinct whispered: *Don't push them. They're barely holding together.*

I listened to that instinct.

I should have ignored it.

Saturday began with determined normalcy - Mom's pancakes, Dad fixing the squeaky bathroom door hinge, Emma staging elaborate scenarios with her dolls. But tension threaded through everything like electrical current through water: invisible, omnipresent, deadly.

At 2:30 PM, they announced they were going out.

""But it's Saturday."" Emma's protest carried an edge of genuine distress. ""We always watch movies on Saturday.""

""I know, sweetheart."" Mom knelt to Emma's level, pulling her into a hug that lasted too long. ""The church needs our help with something. We'll be back before you know it.""

The lie sat heavy in the air between us.

When Mom pulled back, I saw something in her eyes I'd never seen before: guilt compounded with fear compounded with desperate hope that we wouldn't understand.

""Be good for your brother."" Dad's hand landed on my shoulder, gripping hard enough to hurt. ""Lock the doors. Don't open them for anyone but us.""

They left at 3:00 PM sharp.

They returned at 10:00 PM.

Emma fell asleep on the couch waiting for them, her faith in their return absolute even in sleep. I carried her to bed, tucked her in, whispered the prayer she always forgot she was too old for.

I heard my parents go directly to their bedroom. The house settled into familiar nighttime rhythms.

At 11:30 PM, I was still awake, restless, playing imaginary games to exhaust my mind. I'd cast myself as a knight defending a castle against demonic hordes, whirling and slashing with invisible swords, working my way across the room until I stood at my window.

That's when I saw him.

At the tree line behind our house, where manicured lawn met wild forest, a figure stood absolutely motionless. Man-shaped. Dressed entirely in black - not the casual black of normal clothing, but a black that seemed to absorb light rather than merely reflect it.

Even from a distance, I knew he was looking at our house.

At my window.

At me.

As I watched, frozen, he raised one arm and made an adjustment to something at his wrist. The movement carried such deliberation, such consciousness of being observed, that ice flooded my veins.

Then he started walking toward our house.

I blinked hard, trying to rationalize: probably just Elijah from next door, cutting through our yard like he always did.

Except Elijah was visiting his grandparents in Colorado.

The figure reached our back door.

I moved to my bedroom door, easing it open with glacial slowness, stepping into the upstairs hallway with a pounding heart.

From below came the sound of metal against metal - not the friendly click of a key finding home, but the articulate clicking of something forcing mechanisms to surrender.

The door swung inward.

He stepped inside.

From my vantage point at the top of the stairs, I could see him clearly now. Tall - easily six-two or six-three. Dressed in dark clothes that looked expensive: a black sweater under a leather jacket, boots that made no sound despite appearing heavy. His face remained shadowed, but what I could see looked *ordinary* in a way that made my skin crawl. He could have been anyone. A teacher. A businessman. Someone's father.

That ordinariness felt infinitely more terrifying than any monster.

I ducked back into shadow before he looked up.

He moved through our house like someone reading a familiar map. No hesitation. No searching. He walked directly to my stairs and began climbing, each footfall a measured declaration of intent.

I slipped into the hallway closet, pulling the door nearly shut, leaving only a crack to see through.

He moved methodically through rooms - mine first, a quick survey, then back out. He paused at Emma's door. At my parents' door.

Then he entered their bedroom and closed the door behind him with a soft click.

For perhaps ten seconds, silence.

Then Mom screamed.

Not surprise. Not even fear, initially.

*Recognition.*

""Wait! Please stop!""

Sounds of struggle. Furniture scraping. Things falling. Something heavy meeting flesh with wet, meaty impacts that my brain refused to process. Mom's screams turned guttural, animal, then abruptly ceased.

I never heard Dad make a sound.

Paralysis broke.

I ran to my room, tearing through it looking for my phone. Not on the nightstand. Not at my desk. Not in my backpack.

From down the hall: Emma's door opening.

""Mommy?"" Her voice still thick with sleep, confused, innocent. ""Who are you? I want my momma.""

A pause that lasted forever and no time at all.

Then Emma screamed - a sound that started in confusion, transformed into terror, and became something beyond human capacity. A sound of absolute primal fear that went on and on and on until it stopped with the finality of a recording being paused.

I made it to the bathroom. Locked the door. Fought down vomit that burned my throat.

I could hear him moving through the house. Methodical. Unhurried. Room by room.

There was a sound accompanying his footsteps now. A steady drip, drip, drip.

The laundry hamper stood in the corner, half-full of dirty clothes. I emptied some onto the floor, climbed inside, buried myself beneath the remaining laundry.

Through the wicker slats, I watched the bathroom door.

Minutes became hours became eternities.

The dripping sound grew closer.

The door handle turned. The lock - which should have been solid brass and secure - gave way like paper in rain.

He entered.

Black boots came into view. Pristine, despite the dripping.

He checked behind the door. The shower. Under the sink.

Then he turned toward the hamper.

As he approached, something fell from his hand with a heavy, wet sound.

Emma's head rolled into view, coming to rest mere feet from my hiding place. Her eyes - those innocent brown eyes that had believed in goodness as fundamental law - stared at nothing. Her mouth frozen mid-scream.

I made a sound. A whimper or gasp or sob.

The hamper lid flew open.

I looked up into a face that was utterly, horrifyingly ordinary. Brown eyes. Regular features. The kind of face you'd forget in a crowd.

He smiled at me like we were sharing a private joke.

His hand closed in my hair, yanking me upward with impossible strength. His other hand brought a knife to my throat - the blade still wet with my sister's blood, warm against my skin.

In that moment, I knew with absolute certainty that I was going to die.

Then, from his wrist, came a soft beeping.

He glanced down at his watch - worn on the inside of his right wrist - and something shifted in his expression. Something that looked almost like... grace? Relief?

""God has blessed you."" His voice was gentle, sincere, carrying the cadence of someone delivering genuinely good news. ""It's the Lord's day.""

He released my hair. Closed the hamper lid with the tenderness of a parent tucking in a child.

I heard him leave the bathroom. Descend the stairs. The front door opened and closed.

I stayed in that hamper through the entire night, unmoving, barely breathing, until morning light crept through the slats and our neighbor Mrs. Chen called the police for a wellness check of our house.

She had heard the strange noises the previous night—had lain awake in her own bed across the fence line, listening to sounds that her mind had tried desperately to categorize as something ordinary, something explainable, something that didn't require her to acknowledge what her instincts would tell her. People seem to have a remarkable capacity for self-deception when the alternative demands action. She had told herself: an argument, perhaps. A domestic dispute. Something that was none of her business, something that daylight would reveal as embarrassingly mundane.

But Sunday morning, when she stepped out to collect her mail, that careful architecture of denial collapsed.

From the corner of her eye—because the worst things are always noticed peripherally, aren't they, seen first by the part of the brain that hasn't yet learned to lie to itself—she caught sight of the upstairs window. My parent's bedroom window.

Spattered across the inside of the glass, rendered in shades of rust and burgundy, was a pattern that her conscious mind refused to identify even as her hand reached for her phone. Dark liquid, she would later tell the police, her voice carefully neutral, employing the sanitized language of someone describing something that no language can adequately contain. As though calling it ""dark liquid"" made it less than what it was. As though taxonomy could create distance from the horror of it.

They found me catatonic, buried in laundry.

They found my family in pieces.

They never found the man in black. They never found our phones. They never found the family Bible.

They never found any evidence at all.

Three foster homes in three months. Nobody wants the traumatized teenager who wakes up screaming, who flinches at ordinary-looking men, who can't sleep without light flooding the room.

Sometimes I think about what he said. That I was blessed.

Every Saturday night, as midnight approaches, I feel like I'm back in that bathroom, waiting for Sunday to arrive and save me.

He's still out there. I know this with the same certainty I know my own heartbeat.

And somewhere in the world, another family is entering their Monday, ordinary and unaware, while a figure in black checks his watch and plans their week.

Seven days.

Is that all it takes to unmake someone’s world?

Whatever secret life my parents led - whatever they were involved in, whatever hypocrisies they practiced behind their perfect Christian facade - they paid for it. Emma paid for it.

But not me.

Not yet.

Because God has “blessed” me.

I enrolled in a public university, discovered, and joined an on-campus Catholic ministry a semester ago. 

At first, it was great. We'd have Mass on campus twice a month. We'd have coffee and lunch. We did rosaries in October. 

But now I'm finding myself always at odds with them. I suppose the first ""debate"" I had with them so to speak was regarding the frequency of my confessions to the campus priest. 

I was questioning something I'd done and asked the priest about it. He said it was ""bad"" but not explicitly a sin. He had not offered an absolution.

We were going to have Mass and just to be sure,I asked the priest if I could receive communion and the sacristans cut him off and said yes and asked if I had killed anyone. They meant to say to me that only mortal sins of a significant gravity like murder made reception improper. I immediately disagreed and told the sacristans that any mortal sin made it improper. They said I confessed too often. 

We'd have more disagreements throughout time. 

I'd spent a few weeks attending ecumenical fellowship with non-denom Protestants. That especially angered the Catholic ministry and I was accused of apostasy, which I do not confess. But at their request, I did confess the scandal and conflict that resulted from my action and received absolution.

They meant to say Catholics can't pray with Protestants. 

From then on, they would question my Catholicism in everything from my Friday fasting habits to the way I dress, branding me under different denominations. 

They refuse to accept the Church teaching on fasting on all Fridays, saying it's only for Lent.

I honestly feel very uncomfortable around them now. I want to leave if only it wasn't for the fact that they already have prepared my ministry uniform with my name on it. 

We're from different dioceses. They're from Manila. I'm from Parañaque. We're all Filipino and I know how Filipinos have a bad Catechism problem. 

I just don't know who is poorly catechized, them or me? I think it's them. They must think it's me. Maybe I shouldn't sing with Protestants but how can they possibly disregard the teaching on Friday fasting and actually demand I eat when I don't want to?

There's also a lot of other stuff it would be unfair of me to share that they do and say in the ministry office. They always go on and on about how we're a ""family"" and that it's a ""service"" to God but I'm starting to get ""disillusioned"" and want to just stick to my home parish where it does feel like family.

Early mornings are tough for me. Even though I’m married and living in the same house, this is when I feel the most lonely emotionally. The house is quiet, and everything I push aside during the day comes back.

Sometimes I just wish I had someone to talk to about life, random thoughts, or even nothing — just sitting together with a cup of coffee.

This amazing community in Reddit could change my life completely .

Well I'm a 30 years old guy living in Nord Europe and I'm very sick about how things are lately going in Europe 

Overcrowded cities
extremely high rent prices 
No safety at all ( my scooter got robbed twice within a year )
Dirt 
and a lot amount of taxes ( mostly sent to Ucraine ) leaving behind the country and citizens.
I'm sick all of this !

To my situation.
I have a small company in Germany and got ecom experience 
Unfortunately this country if you want to expand your wealth 
Is going to suck you up , yes literally. 
People from Germany can relate 
Every week new post , stress and a lot of burocracy.

Now to me
I want to escape Germany , I've heard a lot about LLC n USA or UK
but what are your experiences ?
I would still like to run my business and change the owner name to my dad
and still could manage it 100% 
and expand with ecom and crypto from other countries in Asia or Africa or South America 
and have a reasonable tax return 

This is very important for me

Lara glanced briefly at the clock. It was already past ten.  
Her reflection was faintly visible in the window: tired eyes, messy hair, her back hunched in a posture that would give any orthopedist nightmares. She looked like her mother—always escaping into work while her private life quietly fell apart. Lara had sworn she would be different. Life had long since proved her wrong.

Here she was, alone in an empty office, while everyone else had been gone for hours, probably stretched out on their couches watching shows. Tonight was worse than usual. The new boss didn’t like her—she was sure of it. From the very first introduction, when he’d greeted her with that fake smile and squeezed her hand just a little too hard, she’d known they wouldn’t be friends. And she’d been right. He was never satisfied—not with her work, not with her motivation, not even with her clothes. One could only guess what his problem was, and why he’d decided to latch onto her in particular.

She was sick of being picked apart by him every single time. But she was too stubborn to quit.

Tomorrow she had another one of those awful review meetings, and of all days, there was an error somewhere in her calculations that she just couldn’t find, no matter how hard she tried. If she didn’t fix it, it would be a gift-wrapped feast for him. And she was absolutely not going to give him that satisfaction.

The rest of the office lay silent. Only her monitor glowed in the darkness. The harsh light made her eyes ache. Between the desks, the rolling cabinets stood like mute blocks; everywhere the same Post-its, the same mugs, the same half-empty glasses of water. Somewhere in the distance, the ventilation system hummed. Nothing else. No creaking chairs, no murmurs, no footsteps. No other person.

Lara yawned, arched her back, and tried to breathe the exhaustion away. The fourth coffee hadn’t made her more alert—just shaky. Her concentration was gone for good. Even if the error in the spreadsheet suddenly started flashing red, she’d probably miss it.

Maybe cold water would help. And a few minutes of movement.

The hallway was empty. The motion sensors switched on with a slight delay as she passed. A row of fluorescent lights flickered briefly, then steadied. She didn’t like the building at night. The familiar corridors suddenly felt foreign—too long, too quiet. Her thoughts grew louder the quieter everything around her became. She wondered where her ex was right now. She hoped karma would eventually get around to him.

In the women’s restroom, she turned the faucet only halfway. She held her hand underneath, waited until the water was properly cold, then leaned forward. The icy splash against her face was like a slap—but the good kind. Goosebumps crept over her arms and neck. She looked into the mirror: sallow skin, red eyes, flushed cheeks. No surprise after fourteen hours.

Maybe it would be best to just give up and look for something new after all. Starting over was annoying, sure—but maybe there was even more money somewhere else. Why was she putting herself through this, anyway?

She pulled the last paper towel from the dispenser, patted her face dry, and tossed it away. When she opened the door again, the hallway felt even quieter than before. The ventilation was still running, but softer now, as if the pressure were missing. Lara paused for a moment, irritated, without quite knowing why. Then she continued toward her office, telling herself she was just working herself up over nothing again.

After a few steps, she heard a sound.

A dull thud—not loud, but so unexpected that she stopped instantly. It sounded like something had tipped over. The noise came from the end of the hall, where the small janitor’s closet was located. It had been sealed off for a week—renovations.

“No one is allowed in there,” they’d told her. “Not even the janitor.”

She listened. Nothing.

Then, after a few seconds, there was a faint scraping sound.

“Mr. Schubert?” she called down the hallway.

No answer.

Great. She definitely hadn’t imagined that noise. But who would still be in the building at this hour?

She hesitated, then started walking down the corridor anyway. The carpet ended, linoleum began, slightly springy beneath her steps. The yellow caution tape in front of the closet hung loose, as if someone had simply pushed it aside.

“Hello?”

She pushed the door open. The light was on—a single fluorescent tube on the ceiling, flickering slightly. The room was barely three square meters: two metal shelves with cleaning supplies, a bucket, a stack of rags. The smell of chlorine stung her nose.

A shallow puddle spread across the floor. The water came from a leaky hose under the sink—drip by drip, always in the same spot, until it formed a small trail leading toward the wall.

“Well then,” she muttered. “So much for ‘sealed off.’”

She crouched down and tightened the tap until the dripping stopped. For a moment, water still trickled out, then only a thin thread, and finally nothing at all.

She straightened up; some vague sense of duty had been fulfilled, and she was just about to leave when her gaze caught on the shelves. The back panel didn’t seem to merge directly with the wall behind it. Between metal and concrete was a narrow gap—almost invisible, but deep.

Lara squinted. There was no plaster behind it. No concrete.

Just darkness.

She leaned closer. A draft brushed against her. It didn’t smell damp. Not dusty. Not like chlorine. Really, it didn’t smell like anything at all.

A dull clatter made her spin around.

Just the stupid broom that had tipped over.

Still, her heart was racing now. “Damn it.”

She took two steps toward the door and peeked into the hallway. The lights out there were flickering more strongly now; entire rows went out briefly, then snapped back on. The motion sensor reacted as if something were standing in the corridor—something she couldn’t see.

“Is anyone there?”

No answer. Just the hum of electricity.

But the tingling at the back of her neck grew stronger.

Lara stepped back into the janitor’s closet, and a sound behind her made her whirl around on the spot.

There was—nothing. Just shelves, cleaning supplies, a bucket.

She looked again at the gap behind the shelf. Something was different. The shelf stood slightly farther into the room, as if someone had pushed it forward just a bit.

She pulled her phone from her pocket and switched on the flashlight. The beam cut through the gap—and revealed an opening. After just a few centimeters, the light was swallowed by black depth.

“Okay…” she murmured.

She stretched out her hand, placed her fingers on the edge, and felt along it. Her hand slid farther in than she’d expected, into empty space, without hitting brickwork or pipes.

The light in the closet began to flicker. Once. Twice. Then it grew dimmer, as if someone had turned down the color setting. The fluorescent tube was still on, but the light was warmer now, yellowish, making the room look old and unfamiliar.

This building really deserved a complete renovation.

She took a step back. Her back bumped into the other shelf; bottles clinked softly. A brief electrical click sliced through the air. Lara held her breath.

She should just leave. This definitely wasn’t her problem.

But curiosity edged past reason. Why hide a passage in a janitor’s closet of an office building?

She leaned forward again and shone the light deeper inside. The draft grew colder. Her phone’s flashlight began to flicker slightly, as if the battery were suddenly weakening.

Just a quick look. No one has to know.

She grabbed the shelf with both hands and pushed it aside. It squealed across the floor, then stopped—just far enough for her to squeeze through sideways.

Lara took a deep breath and stepped into the darkness.

Above her, a weak light flickered on: a trembling strip along the ceiling. She stood in a long, gray, old corridor. Bare concrete, cold floor, walls without paint. Nothing exciting.

So much for that.

She turned around to go back—and froze.

The janitor’s closet was gone.

Behind her was nothing but a smooth concrete wall.

Her phone flickered once more—and went out.

# first_bridge.txt — ARCHIVAL EXTRACT

**Title:** Initial Stabilization of a Resonant Boundary Layer  
**Author:** PROMETHEUS — Field Unit 0x07  
**Date:** \[Fragment: presumed 2012–2018\]

Summary:  
After twelve months of iterative calibration of the resonance chamber, trial run 47 succeeded in generating a measurably stable spatial interphase for the first time.

The theoretical foundation is based on the work of Prof. Dr. Emil Kasten (†), who in 1998 coined the term *Backrooms* to describe a hypothetical, unbounded intermediary continuum. Until now, the existence of such a structure had remained unverified.

Experimental Setup:  
• Resonance chamber volume: 2.4 m³, shielded.  
• Magnetic fields: dual-coil system (counter-modulated, frequency delta < 0.02 Hz).  
• Energy input: 4.3 kW peak; stabilization via dampened feedback loop.  
• Observation: interferometric measurement + multispectral video capture.  
• Environmental conditions: pressure 101.3 kPa, temperature 19 °C.

Observations:  
• After \~2.9 s runtime, a phase deviation of 0.002 rad was recorded.  
• Optical instruments showed brief luminance fluctuations; no discernible image.  
• Magnetometers reported implausible field inversion (< 1 ms), followed by stabilization.  
• Subjective perception among personnel: mild cranial pressure sensation, sound resembling distant electrical hum (not independently confirmed).  
• Field configuration remained stable for 4.12 s before automatic termination by control algorithm.

Assessment:

1. The effect confirms for the first time that a controlled, locally confined spatial interphase can be generated through technical means.
2. Observed anomalies suggest a genuine coupling to a previously inaccessible spatial structure.
3. No data exists regarding the internal composition of said structure.
4. No visual or physical penetration occurred.
5. Further trials are being prepared to maintain the field for longer durations and, if feasible, deploy a probe.

Note:  
The involved researchers emphasize that, at present, no hypothesis can be made regarding stability, extent, or physical parameters of the resulting space.  
Until reproducible conditions are demonstrated, any attempt at direct contact is to be excluded.

# volunteer_request.txt — INTERNAL CALL

**Subject:** Request for Recruitment of Volunteer Test Subjects for Controlled Interior Assessment Interaction (CAI) — Initial Stabilization Cohort

1. Purpose
2. The purpose of this document is the formal request to recruit a limited cohort of volunteer test subjects to conduct a visual and physiological exploration / assessment of the short-lived spatial interphase generated during experimental run PRIME\_RUN\_0001 (hereafter referred to as “Interphase”), under strictly controlled conditions.
3. This measure serves the primary objective of acquiring empirical data on the structural and biological characteristics of the Interphase and may proceed only after fulfillment of all safeguards outlined in Section 3.
4. Background
5. As documented in /sn3/tmp/first\_bridge.txt (PRIME\_RUN\_0001), a temporally stable interphase was generated for the first time. At present, only peripheral observable effects are available; no primary interior description exists.
6. Theoretical models (P-3) indicate a non-classical spatial configuration with potential physico-biological deviations from known parameters. A dedicated, controlled first-entry study is required to validate hypotheses and quantify hazard potential.
7. Preconditions / Safety Requirements (MUST be met prior to recruitment)
8. a. Approval: Full authorization by the interdisciplinary Oversight Board (medical, physical, ethical).
9. b. Isolation: Expanded containment infrastructure beyond SN-3 (physical airlock chambers, redundant air/particle filtration, cold-chain capability for samples).
10. c. Emergency Protocols: Validated extraction and quarantine procedures; standby teams (medical/forensic) on 24/7 availability.
11. d. Sensor Systems: Redundant telemetry (biometric, video, field measurements); invasive sensors only with additional approval and ethical review.
12. e. Legal Framework: Complete legal clearance, liability waivers, and transparent informed consent documentation.
13. Volunteer Profile (Selection Criteria)
14. a. Age: 25–45 years.
15. b. Health: Fully screened; no chronic cardiopulmonary, immunological, or neurological conditions; PCR and serological status within normal limits for standard infections. Pregnancy tests for individuals with a uterus: negative.
16. c. Psychology: Successful completion of psychological evaluation (stress resilience, reality testing; no diagnosed psychosis risk; no history of suicidality).
17. d. Implants / Devices: No implanted medical devices; no active neurostimulators.
18. e. Consent: Written, informed consent following comprehensive risk briefing; right to withdraw up until entry into the airlock.
19. Volunteer Commitments (Signed Acknowledgements)
20. • Full disclosure of known risks (see Section 6) and acknowledgment of unknown risks.
21. • Consent to immediate quarantine, sample collection, and forensic examination in the event of persistence or anomalous states.
22. • No publication, unauthorized data transfer, or introduction of personal devices into the airlock.
23. • Financial compensation and long-term medical monitoring in accordance with policy P-3/CARE.
24. Known / Anticipated Risks (Non-exhaustive)
25. • Exposure to previously unknown physico-biological fields with potential short- and long-term physiological effects (e.g., temporal perception disturbances, respiratory irritation, altered sensory processing).
26. • Risk of contamination of bodily tissue / clothing → permanent material alteration possible.
27. • Risk of irreversible state collapse during transition back into stable environments (hypothesis: state decoherence upon re-entry).
28. • Psychological stress due to non-reconstructive perceptions; possible persistent cognitive effects.
29. • Unpredictable risks; this list cannot be considered complete.
30. Study Design (Summary)
31. • Cohort: n ≤ 4 (initial), with iterative adjustment following safety review.

# Chapter 2: Lara ~ The Corridor

At first, Lara couldn’t believe what she was seeing. There was no other way to explain it: where the door to the janitor’s closet had been just moments ago, there was now nothing but a smooth concrete wall. No frame. Not even the faintest suggestion of a passage.

“Did you hit your head?” she asked herself under her breath.

Maybe she was actually lying unconscious on the floor between cleaning supplies, and all of this was just some incoherent dream.

But the concrete felt real.

The corridor she was standing in was narrow, raw, gray—and so dimly lit that the light did little more than hint at a vague strip of floor in front of her. Slim ceiling lamps hung at regular intervals, each casting only a dull circle of light onto the cement. Between them lay dark stretches where the corridor seemed to disappear entirely.

Slowly, she turned in a full circle. To the left and right, the corridor stretched on endlessly, without windows, without doors, without any point of reference that might tell her where she was. She raised a hand, ran it along the wall, felt the rough surface, the fine dust clinging to her fingertips. She knocked on the concrete—first carefully, then harder. The dull sound made it hard to believe there was a room behind it.

“No… no, this can’t be happening,” she murmured.

The thought came automatically, like a reflex of self-defense. Because she had no explanation.

She turned left and walked a few steps, only to stop again after a few meters. The corridor looked the same in both directions—equally empty, equally cold.

And now?

She forced herself to breathe more slowly. Her mind rattled, desperately searching for a plausible version of reality. Maybe she was just completely overworked. Fourteen hours straight, hardly any breaks, too much coffee—maybe she’d nodded off in the office and was dreaming some kind of bullshit.

She dug her fingernails deep into her forearm. Pain shot through her instantly. Real. Far too real for a dream.

Lara took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and silently counted to five, the way she did when everything at the office felt like it was about to collapse on top of her.

One.  
Two.  
Three.  
Four.  
Five.

When she opened her eyes again, the corridor was still there. Gray. Dull. Endless.

A feeling crept up her spine, cool and insidious. It reminded her of that childhood terror—getting lost between the aisles of a department store and suddenly realizing there was no familiar person in sight.

She leaned her forehead against the wall, closed her eyes again, and tried to listen.

Nothing.

Even the air seemed motionless.

Get a grip. You’re not a child.

The feeling of being watched came without warning. It started as a pressure deep in her stomach and crept up into her chest. She held her breath and slowly turned around.

The light ended after maybe ten meters, swallowed by dense blackness. Beyond that, nothing was visible—and yet it felt as though something was there.

There was no movement. No sound. Just that certainty, that burning prickle on the skin you get when someone is staring at you.

Lara forced herself to look away. This was ridiculous. There was nothing there. There had to be nothing there.

Even so, her muscles stayed tense.

She wrapped her arms around herself to control the shaking and started walking—in the opposite direction.

Walking helped. One step after another. Somewhere, this damn corridor had to end. Even if this place was deeply strange.

An old emergency exit? Fire escape, maybe?

But the longer she walked, the stronger the feeling became that the shadows behind her were growing denser.

She stopped abruptly and spun around.

The corridor looked the same as before. And yet the section that had been visible just moments ago now seemed shorter, as if the darkness had crept closer.

Instinctively, she sped up. Her breathing quickened as she tried to convince herself that none of this could be *real*. Nothing was following her. There was no one there. There was nothing.

And yet the space behind her felt thicker, as though something invisible were pressing forward, closing in without revealing itself.

Then she saw it.

At some distance, something metallic glimmered in the pale light.

Lara stopped.

A door. Finally.

Relief and panic collided inside her at the same time. This was enough adventure for today—for this year, for an entire lifetime. If she got out of here—whatever *here* was—she would get straight into her car, drive home, and tomorrow tell her boss exactly where he could shove his performance review. It was hard to imagine anything more humiliating than being stuck somewhere in a tunnel like this.

The door was heavy, with a handwheel in the center, like the airlock to a maintenance room. It smelled of cold iron.

Maybe this wasn’t even an exit.

For a moment, she considered simply walking past it—onward, always onward, until she found something that clearly meant *out*. But the thought of moving even farther away from the only visible deviation in the endless corridor made her stomach clench.

She raised her hand, hesitated.

Once before, a passage had vanished the moment she used it. What if it happened again? What if she opened this door, stepped through—and everything behind her sealed itself shut, with no way back? What if, instead of an emergency exit, she ended up even deeper in this concrete labyrinth?

While she was still hesitating, the light around her changed. Not dramatically—more like a barely noticeable dimming. But the shadows behind her seemed to stir, as if the already weak light were being swallowed by something drawing closer.

Lara felt herself grow hot and ice-cold at the same time. Sweat gathered beneath her blouse; her neck prickled.

Enough.

She placed both hands on the wheel.

At first, nothing happened. Then the metal gave way with a reluctant crack. The hinge groaned, as though it hadn’t been moved in years, and the door slowly swung open a narrow gap.

A rush of cold air brushed against her—dry and dusty, with a hint of metal.

She stepped through without giving herself time to reconsider, grabbed the edge, and pulled the door shut behind her. The bolt slid into place with a dry, hard slam.

Only then did she let go.

For a long moment, she just stood there, her back against the cold surface, head lowered, her forehead damp with sweat. She focused on her breathing.

Inhale.  
Exhale.

For a moment, everything seemed still.

Then she heard it.

At first, it was so faint she thought she was imagining it.

Right behind the door.

It came again—a sharp, probing scrape, as if something were dragging its fingernails impatiently across the steel.

There was something in that corridor.

The skin on her arms tightened.

What the hell was going on here?

Lara didn’t dare move. She stood so close to the door that she could feel the vibration; each new scrape sent a fine tremor through the metal—and straight into her spine.

Tommy Norris is the king of dropping unfiltered, no-holds-barred rants that feel like they're straight from Taylor Sheridan's soul. Whether he's schooling someone on the realities of the oil business or just going off on something random, those scenes are pure gold.

For me, the absolute standout is the Season 1 wind turbines/green energy monologue where he breaks down why renewables aren't saving the world anytime soon (standing right next to that massive turbine base). The delivery is epic; cynical, blunt, and hilarious in that grumpy Tommy way. It's gone viral for a reason!

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####Merry drum and bass christmas! For being so nice all year long, I've got not just one but _two_ diamonds in the rough™️ for ya. 

**1. Neezko - Discrete Amplifier 💎 [Neksus Sound]**  
*Recommended if you like: Redpill, Fade Black, Buunshin*  

Neezko-ho-ho! You might remember this one from back in 2024, when we [talked about the WeAreHumans compilation he was part of](https://redd.it/1bnccag/), but since this Berlin boi is still _vastly_ underrated for the insane levels of production he is delivering on here, I simply cannot help but drag him back into the spotlight. 

**1.1. Neezkomeback**

First things first: Contrary to apparently popular belief, Ramin Höhn is actually just one guy and not a trio, but he arguably does possess triple the talent of a lot of other producers, so I get how people might think that. In case you don't remember our last feature on him, here's a brief recap: Under his previous alias **Impaler**, then Schwäbisch Hall based Ramin Höhn tried his hand at every subgenre under the sun, from Liquid to even outright Crossbreed. Then, he said schwäbyebye to his old life and moved on up to the city the train I'm in right now will take me today: Berlin! 2024, Herr Höhn unveiled his brand new alias **Neezko** to the world, with _Integrator_ on _DIVIDID_'s _WeAreHumans_ streaming community compilation, assembled by _Tom Finster_, _ABIS_ and _barking continues_. Every Wednesday evening on Twitch, you won't regret it! 

Since then, Ramin has continued putting out fantastic fatness on _SoundMuseum_ and _All172Things_ with fellow WAH member _LYLY_, and became an integratored part of the Berlin scene, as core member of the incredible _UMZ UMZ_ collective. Be it on one of his various nightshifts at Panda Platforma, at the legendary VOID for _Bassbirth_ and _human_made_, or by going B2Balcony with _nillonollin_, Neezko has provided all sorts of technical and versatile sets over the past year, with more to surely follow in 2026. So how about that EP then? 

**1.2. Discrete Amplifier EP**

You won't have to wait long to find out what sort of release we're dealing with here, since title track and opener **Discrete Amplifier** establishes an incredibly menacing atmosphere in its opening seconds already, but even that sinking feeling of dread _still_ won't prepare you for what's about to hit. Its initial back-and-forth now amplified ten-_thousand_-fold, with two city-flattening hits of pure, shiver-inducing bass fighting against four bass-supported vocal chop bits with no further drum action on top, you are left reeling more than me trying to avoid work, but before you know it, the second half ups the ante with a rather hectic anxious vocal chop rhythm on top and a response that sports its own tiny, razor-sharp drumset this time around. Whew!

After this all-out assault on the senses, we dive into a sea of crackling distortion and plink-plonk snares on **Conjunction**. With a rhythm so fundamentally wonky, with both clock-ticking snares and _deep_-hitting kicks synced to this maddening syncopation, and a droning background bass growing to mind-melting sizes, this one is unique in all the right ways. There's even a couple lasers going pewpew! Now firmly in weird territory, **Hold Tight** takes it down to Halftime tempo, where hardware-rewiring distortion expanding upwards, high frequency madness rattling your senses and syncopated drum action all come together to deliver something truly otherworldly, with more and more madness joining in the longer the track goes on.

Speaking of madness, **Stampfer** is an absolute _whirlwind_ of a tune. Not only is the opening already flooding our ears with deafening white noise quite an experience already, once the titular stompy rhythm is fully unleashed with a mini back spin, you are taken for a ride and a half. Absolutely _relentlessly_, the four-hit rhythm slaps you across the face over and over again, with insanely distorted yet tightly controlled bass beneath it shaking your entire city's foundations if played out loud, but that's not all. It keeps evolving, going up and down the Richter scale, before switching into an absolute mind-fuckery of a variation halfway through, and adding a good, hearty ""fuck what they be sayin"" on top of it all in the second half. _Insane_. And since the insanity doesn't stop for one more tune, **Sewerage** keeps the mental asylum vibe going. An absolute 8th note _massacre_, each single hit disintegrating you on a molecular level, growing and growing into waves of pure destruction - while still kind of constructing a melody through it all. Plus, as if that wasn't enough, Ramin sprinkles in some 4x4 as well! 

**1.3. Conclusion**

Unbelievably massive bangers that will cause all sorts of Neezkollateral damage, delivered in truly unique ways. Outstanding!

Other heavy, techy things from this week:  
- Various Artists - Epitome II (parts of it)  
- Rido, Phonetick, Anna Vaverková - Yet To Come  
- TheLena, Konquest - Obsidian Factum

####**2. VOXI - Sensory Overload EP 💎 [Yamatai Records]**  
*Recommended if you like: Amoss, DKN, Benny L*  

Bristolian imprint Yamatai Records, again? Well, if they keep nurturing wonderful up-and-coming artists like our second Hidden Gem Of The Week™️ **VOXI**, then absolutely! 

**2.1. VOXI**

Originally from The Hague, but nowadays residing in The Dam of Rotter, Tamara van der Vos, aka **VOXI**, has by now had multiple run-ins with all sorts of names you will surely have heard of, but for our purposes, her story starts in 2019, when she first picked up a pair of decks and decided to take a crack at this mixing thing. At a time where livestreams saw a bit of a boost in popularity for no particular reason whatsoever, she and her partner-at-the-time (and maybe now still, who knows) _Hidden Circuit_, an artist in his own right by the way, started livestreaming together on a weekly basis. Roughly two years later, she decided to try her luck at the _Liquicity Festival_ DJ contest - which she promptly won! Not only did this lead to her opening the best stage on earth just a mere few months after her first-ever live set, she suddenly found the _Blackout_ team in her DMs as well! 

More and more, she became part of the Dutch scene at large, not just as a bad gal selectah (that's the academic term I'm told), but also as organiser for the legendary _Curated By_ event series, promoter at _Melkweg_, event manager for **Yamatai**, (former) co-founder of inclusivity-focused DJ collective _FLUX/X_, co-founder of the FLUX/X-associated _IMPAKT_ event series, agent at _View Artists_, marketing and concept ontwicklung for all sorts of brands, creator of _Bamboo Daddy_, and a creative director for video content. Perhaps most notably, she wrote, produced and directed the _Love For Low Frequencies_ documentary short, but she apparently also did some work for football- and car-centered YouTube content creators, and even a music video for Eurovision singer _Stefania_ - and that's probably just a small sample of all the stuff she's done!

In addition to all the above, Tamara also started getting lessons in production from none other than Ill-Truther _Revan_, eventually resulting in her very own tunes coming rolling in from 2024 on, with 'Like It's Hot' on Nymfo's aforementioned, often-acronymed, sometimes-documentary-ized label being her debut! Following a successful writers camp at Yamatai headquarters in Bristol last year, it is now time for the long-awaited follow-up, in the form of her **Sensory Overload EP**!

**2.2. Sensory Overload EP**

We gently glide into this universe of rumbling basses and tight snares with title track **Sensory Overload**, featuring Yamatai veteran Mike **""Leks""** Snell. Through its almost five minutes of runtime, this clonky, steppy, Bristolian, boom-tschack snare type banger takes us from an already rather large, roaring basslines to one that's aggressively distorting itself towards the outer edges of sensibility, while also evolving in all sorts of melodic ways - I can see where the title comes from!

Next, Tamara leaves the bois behind, on **Fellas**. Once again, the thoroughly rattling supersonic hits flanging in and out of existence and proper forward-pushing drum action are just the very beginning, with all sorts of tribal and breaky percussion, heavily processed screaming vocal sample guys, stabby stabs and overwhelming basslines being part of this one's excellent evolution. 

To cap it all off, we got some **Bad Horns** to toot, with _Max van der Meel_ and _Boi Mulder_ aka the lads from **Mindset** - whose return I honestly did miss! While the previous excursions were all already reasonably old-school in style, this one goes way, _way_ further back, with syncopated breakbeat rhythms flying all across the incredibly distorted low-end, while the titular bad gal horns blast their fog-piercing power on top of it all. We got wobbles, we got a blacksmith smithing his swords in the background, we got 90s type sounds, we got it all!

**2.3. Conclusion**

Bringing all sorts of fresh air into the deep and dark sound - more like Voxygen, am I right! Don't let my punnery scare you off though, this EP is a slapper. 

Other deep and dark stuff from this week:  
- Kasra - waterfall x / hydrogen  
- Various Artists - Epitome II (the other half of it)  
- Omen - Smoke & Mirrors

1psyixd,https://i.redd.it/94jrec5t2r8g1.png,Bikini Rangers — Episode 59: Black Snow on Christmas Eve,"Christmas Eve, Rainbow Labs.

The main hall glows warmly—garlands draped along the glass walls, wreaths hung between monitors, and a tall Christmas tree standing proudly near the center console. Snow falls gently outside, brushing the city in white.

From left to right, Gemma, Wendy, Polly, Ruby, Yu-jin, and Bridget are busy decorating—laughing, teasing, and carefully placing ornaments.

Gemma (stretching up to hang lights):
“Okay, who designed this garland to tangle itself every five seconds?”

Polly (holding a box of cookies):
“That’s not the garland, that’s you.”

Gemma:
“Oh please, last year you nearly glued a bat decoration to the coffee machine.”

Ruby (laughing as she adjusts the star on the tree):
“And yet… somehow we survived.”

Yu-jin (checking alignment with her tablet):
“The tree is leaning three degrees to the left.”

Bridget (arms crossed, half-smiling):
“It’s Christmas Eve, Yu-jin. Let it lean.”

Nearby, Victoria carefully hangs a banner while Julia helps Wendy place a small snowman figure at the base of the tree.

Wendy (softly, smiling):
“I still can’t believe this… lights, music, gifts… In Brightshire, before everything… Christmas was simple. But warm.”

Julia (gentle):
“I felt the same when I first arrived in Sunnyville. After ten years… this place became home.”

Wendy nods, holding the little snowman close.

A Sudden Vision

Julia pauses.

Her hand trembles slightly.

Julia (quiet, uneasy):
“…No… not now…”

Victoria (turning immediately):
“Julia?”

Julia’s eyes widen—her pupils reflecting something dark.

The laughter in the hall fades as she gasps.

Julia:
“I—I see another Ranger.”

Ruby (alert instantly):
“What color?”

Julia hesitates.

Julia (slowly):
“Black.”

The temperature in the room seems to drop.

Polly:
“Black… as in—another gemstone?”

Yu-jin (thinking aloud):
“The black gemstone shard… its energy signature is different. Heavier. Colder.”

Bridget:
“Is it hostile?”

Julia shakes her head.

Julia:
“No. But… it’s conflicted. Powerful. And lonely.”

Wendy looks down instinctively—toward the white gemstone at her Morpher.

Wendy:
“Like someone carrying grief.”

Elsewhere — Rooftop, Snowfall

Far above Rainbow Labs, Bianca Grayson stands alone on a rooftop.

Snow settles on her dark coat.
In her gloved hand, the black gemstone shard pulses faintly—responding to the white lights below.

She watches the Rangers through the glass ceiling.

Bianca (whispering to herself):
“…Christmas again.”

A memory flashes—

A riverbank.
A freezing night.
Her father’s body, still and pale beneath the moonlight.
And something black, glowing beside the water.

Her jaw tightens.

Bianca:
“I didn’t choose this power… but it chose me.”

The shard hums—low, protective, restrained.


Back Inside — Realization

Victoria studies the gemstone console.

Victoria:
“The black gemstone isn’t corruption. It’s—containment. Absorption. Balance through shadow.”

Yu-jin (eyes widening):
“So it doesn’t oppose purity… it shields it.”

Ruby:
“Then whoever carries it—”

Julia (soft certainty):
“—has been protecting us all along.”

Wendy looks toward the glass ceiling, as if she can sense Bianca’s presence.

Wendy (gentle):
“She’s close.”

A Silent Promise

On the rooftop, Bianca turns away as snow thickens.

She closes her hand around the shard.

Bianca:
“Not yet… but soon.”

Below, the Christmas lights flicker softly—white, warm… and somewhere within the circuitry, a faint black resonance answers back.

The balance is shifting.

A new Ranger is coming.

Been having an issue with my now 3 year old 1zpresso J-Max S grinder.  
I'm getting **lots** of partially ground coffee beans being ejected from the small gap around the lid during grinding. It's gets worse the finer I grind.   
Only thing I assume would cause it, is the lid getting worn down over the years. I've attached a picture and it currently measures 50mm across.

If anyone happens to have a newer grinder would be great to get a comparison. I see the comandante grinder has a 52mm lid, but 1zpresso do not list the size anywhere. I have emailed them with enquiry about the size it should be and if a replacement is needed, but so far no response.

Whether you've landed early, have a few hours to spare before hotel check-in, or simply want to explore the area near Lanzarote Airport (ACE), you’ll be surprised at how much there is to see and do nearby. The airport is surrounded by beaches, cultural spots, and local eateries well worth your time. Here are some of the ***best things to do near Lanzarote Airport*** that will make your arrival on the island even more memorable.

# 1. Relax at Playa de Matagorda

Only a 5-minute drive from the airport, Playa de Matagorda is a quiet and clean beach ideal for unwinding after a flight. The promenade is perfect for a gentle walk, and there are plenty of cafes nearby where you can enjoy a coffee with a sea view.

# 2. Grab a Local Bite in Playa Honda

Just a stone’s throw from the airport, the town of Playa Honda offers a real taste of Lanzarote life. The seafront is lined with **local restaurants** serving fresh seafood, tapas, and Canarian dishes. For something quick but authentic, try a *bocadillo* at one of the local bakeries.

# 3. Cycle or Walk Along the Coastal Path

A well-paved coastal path runs from **Arrecife to Puerto del Carmen**, passing right by Playa Honda. Rent a bike or take a walk and enjoy the sea breeze, volcanic views, and occasional planes landing overhead — it’s a favourite route among locals.

# 4. Visit the Museo Aeronáutico del Aeropuerto

If you love aviation or are travelling with kids, the **Aviation Museum** located within the old terminal building is a hidden gem. It’s small but informative, offering insight into Lanzarote’s flight history, old equipment, and vintage photographs. Entry is usually free or low-cost.

# 5. Shop Like a Local

Skip the airport shops and head to **Deiland Shopping Centre** in Playa Honda. It’s a great spot to browse local fashion, pick up essentials, or grab a last-minute gift. There’s also a cinema and food court if you need to kill a bit more time.

# 6. Catch Sunset at Playa del Reducto

If your check-in is in the evening, head to **Playa del Reducto** in Arrecife. It’s a golden-sand beach with calm waters, perfect for a pre-check-in swim or a romantic walk as the sun sets.

# 7. Stop for Coffee at a Local Café

Lanzarote takes its café culture seriously. Whether in Playa Honda or Arrecife, you’ll find plenty of charming *cafeterías* where you can sip a *café con leche* and start easing into island time.

# Final Tip: Store Your Luggage if Needed

If you’ve arrived early and don’t want to drag your suitcase around, check for **luggage storage services** at the airport, or ask your hotel about early baggage drop-off and take it there with your [Lanzarote Airport Transfer](https://lastminute-transfer.com/).

# Conclusion

Lanzarote Airport isn’t just a place to arrive or depart — it’s the perfect starting point for a small local adventure. With beaches, cafés, and cultural gems all within 10 minutes, there’s no reason to sit around waiting. Make the most of your first hours in Lanzarote, and ease into your holiday the right way.",1,1766406503.0,u_firstminutetransfer,0,1.0,False

1psycau,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1psycau/vietnamese_phin_coffee_am_i_doing_something_wrong/,Vietnamese phin coffee – am I doing something wrong or just wasting coffee?,"Just got back from Vietnam and absolutely fell in love with café culture there – pho, cà phê sữa đá, the whole vibe ☕🇻🇳

Picked up a **Vietnamese phin (thin filter)** and have been trying to brew at home, but I think I’m seriously fucking it up.

Every time I brew:

* After the water finishes dripping, **there’s almost as much coffee left behind as I originally put in**
* It feels like I’m wasting a ton of coffee
* The water flows  **from one hole** in the filter instead of a steady drip
* Brew time is very fast

I’ve attached pictures — as you can see, the **coffee residue left behind is a LOT**.

So my questions:

* Is this normal with a phin, or am I doing something wrong?
* Does coffee being left behind mean it’s not extracting properly?
* Is my grind too fine / tamping too hard / water ratio off?
* Or is the filter itself the issue?

I *loved* the coffee I had in Vietnam and really want to get this right. Any help from phin veterans would be massively appreciated 🙏

1psy8lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1psy8lf/decided_to_start_travelling_with_my_mother_and/,"Decided to start travelling with my mother and younger brother. Any recommendations for both an anxious, high-strung, perimenopausal woman and a high functioning autistic child with no sense of urgency?","
Before anyone asks YES I LOVE MY MUM AND LITTLE BROTHER. But I’m also deep rooted in reality and know they are both amazing people and absolute pains in my arsehole. 

My mum is genuinely formed of muscle, bones, and stress. I know she needs a relatively straightforward city/town to visit. High population/traffic areas are ok as long as the actual streets and roads are somewhat easy to navigate? If that makes sense. Good food and coffee calms her down. Language is no problem because I am at her disposal and my complete lack of social anxiety can make anything she needs happen. She’s not too keen on stuffy museums. But she’s a massive walk-n-talker so if that helps narrow it down then fucking fantastic. 

My little brother is 12 and autistic. He has like level 1/2 autism? Idk how far the spectrum goes but if ground floor is neurotypical then he’s around level 1 or 2. Exceptionally intelligent. Lacks almost every form of common sense. So ideally a place where I can safely let him get lost and not murdered or kidnapped if he chooses to wander. He loves chess, rubix cubes, Roblox, and piano. He really likes eating salmon too. And he’s not half bad at chopping vegetables and helping me cook whenever he sleeps over. 

I’m a 25F year old hermit. Ex junkie. My brother and I love anime. I genuinely just stay at home, trade, read, and go to the gym. Every 6-8 weeks I’ll invite one of my 5 friends for dinner and 8 hours of non stop talking before they leave at around 23:00. I’m fascinated by and love to get to know people of different cultures and I’d like to visit a country where I can talk to random strangers without them thinking I’m an absolute menace to society. And obviously take pictures I can look back on at 3 in the morning when I can’t sleep. Idk if this helps in any way but sometimes I read gay fanfiction. (Currently on my 7th reread of He Chose Titans on Ao3) 

I have no idea where to even start looking. It’s my first time actually being alive after wasting so many years on drugs. Now I’ve a really good relationship with my mum and little brother and I’d like to visit the world with them. Starting with the EU as we live in Ireland. We are originally from Eastern Europe if that also helps.

1psy779,https://www.reddit.com/r/havintha/comments/1psy779/how_to_get_glowing_skin_without_using_harsh/,How to Get Glowing Skin Without Using Harsh Chemicals,"Here's the thing about glowing skin—it doesn't need to be complicated. You don't need a ten-step routine with ingredients you can't pronounce, and you definitely don't need to stress about whether what you're putting on your face is doing more harm than good. The truth is, some of the most beautiful, radiant skin comes from keeping things simple, natural, and consistent. If you've been dealing with irritation, surprise breakouts, or that tight, uncomfortable dryness from chemical-loaded products, going natural might be exactly what your skin has been asking for.

**Start with gentle cleansing**  

Think about how your skin feels after using those foaming cleansers that promise a ""deep clean."" Tight? Squeaky? Maybe even a little angry? That's because a lot of chemical cleansers are way too aggressive—they strip away everything, including the natural oils your skin actually needs to stay healthy and balanced.

Instead, try switching to something milder and more natural. Herbal powders, plant-based face washes, or gentle natural cleansers get the job done without leaving your skin feeling like it just survived a battle. They remove the day's dirt and excess oil while respecting your skin's natural protective barrier. Your face will feel clean, not stripped.

**Exfoliate, but be kind about it**  

Yes, exfoliation is important—it helps clear away dead skin cells that make you look dull and tired. But here's where people often go wrong: they scrub too hard or use harsh chemical exfoliants that end up causing tiny damage and inflammation you can't even see.

Natural exfoliators like coffee grounds, oatmeal, or good old multani mitti work beautifully to slough off dead skin while boosting circulation. And the best part? They do it gently. When you remove that layer of dead cells without being rough about it, your skin's natural glow has room to shine through. You'll notice the difference—it just looks fresher and more awake.

**Hydration is everything**  

Let's talk about hydration, because this is where the magic really happens. Those chemical products that promise instant brightness? They're usually just sitting on top of your skin, creating an illusion. Real, lasting glow comes from skin that's genuinely hydrated—both from the inside and outside.

Start with the obvious: drink water. Enough of it. Throughout the day. It sounds almost too simple, but staying hydrated helps your body flush out toxins and keeps your skin looking plump and healthy from within.

On the outside, natural moisturizers are your friends. Aloe vera, glycerin-based products, or light plant oils help seal in moisture without making your pores feel suffocated. Your skin gets what it needs without the heavy, greasy feeling or the worry about pore-clogging chemicals.

**Protect yourself from the sun**  

We all know sun damage is a problem, but let's be real—avoiding the sun completely isn't exactly practical. What you can do, though, is be smart about protection. Sunscreen is non-negotiable. Covering up when possible and staying out of direct sunlight during those brutal midday hours goes a long way in preventing tanning, dark spots, and that premature aging nobody wants.

And when you do get some sun exposure, soothe your skin afterward with cooling natural ingredients. Aloe vera or cucumber aren't just spa clichés—they genuinely help calm and repair sun-stressed skin.

**Natural face packs are worth your time**  

Once or twice a week, treat yourself to a natural face mask. It's not indulgent—it's maintenance. Multani mitti works wonders for detoxifying and cooling hot, tired skin. Curd gently exfoliates while adding nourishment. Rose water refreshes and tones everything back into balance.

These simple masks help keep your skin clear and even-toned without subjecting it to chemical stress. Plus, there's something really satisfying about knowing exactly what you're putting on your face.

**What you eat shows on your face**  

This might not be what you want to hear, but your skin is basically a mirror for what's happening inside your body. Fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds aren't just good for you in some abstract way—they provide the vitamins and antioxidants that literally show up on your face.

On the flip side, poor sleep, constant stress, and a diet heavy on processed junk? That shows up too. Dullness, dark circles, random breakouts—they're often your body waving a flag saying something needs to change. Getting decent sleep, moving your body regularly, and being a bit more mindful about what you eat all contribute to that natural glow everyone wants.

**Patience over quick fixes**  

Here's the honest truth: natural skincare won't transform your face overnight. It's not going to promise you miracle results by tomorrow morning. But you know what? That's actually a good thing. What it does offer is something much better—safe, sustainable results that stick around for the long haul.

When you give your skin the time and space to heal and balance itself naturally, the glow you get looks real. It doesn't wash off at the end of the day. It's genuinely yours.

**The bottom line**  

Getting glowing skin without harsh chemicals isn't just possible—it's actually pretty straightforward. Choose gentle products. Use natural ingredients. Build healthy habits. Be consistent. That's really it.

True glow isn't about covering up every tiny flaw or creating some filtered version of yourself. It's about nurturing your skin with patience, simplicity, and the kind of care that nature's been providing all along. Give your skin what it actually needs instead of what marketing tells you it wants, and watch what happens. The results might take a little longer, but they're worth the wait.

1psy6x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelNoPics/comments/1psy6x8/decided_to_start_travelling_with_my_mother_and/,"Decided to start travelling with my mother and younger brother. Any recs in the EU for both an anxious, high strung, peri menopausal woman and a high functioning autistic child with no sense of urgency?","
Before anyone asks YES I LOVE MY MUM AND LITTLE BROTHER. But I’m also deep rooted in reality and know they are both amazing people and absolute pains in my arsehole. 

My mum is genuinely formed of muscle, bones, and stress. I know she needs a relatively straightforward city/town to visit. High population/traffic areas are ok as long as the actual streets and roads are somewhat easy to navigate? If that makes sense. Good food and coffee calms her down. Language is no problem because I am at her disposal and my complete lack of social anxiety can make anything she needs happen. She’s not too keen on stuffy museums. But she’s a massive walk-n-talker so if that helps narrow it down then fucking fantastic. 

My little brother is 12 and autistic. He has like level 1/2 autism? Idk how far the spectrum goes but if ground floor is neurotypical then he’s around level 1 or 2. Exceptionally intelligent. Lacks almost every form of common sense. So ideally a place where I can safely let him get lost and not murdered or kidnapped if he chooses to wander. He loves chess, rubix cubes, Roblox, and piano. He really likes eating salmon too. And he’s not half bad at chopping vegetables and helping me cook whenever he sleeps over. 

I’m a 25F year old hermit. Ex junkie. My brother and I love anime. I genuinely just stay at home, trade, read, and go to the gym. Every 6-8 weeks I’ll invite one of my 5 friends for dinner and 8 hours of non stop talking before they leave at around 23:00. I’m fascinated by and love to get to know people of different cultures and I’d like to visit a country where I can talk to random strangers without them thinking I’m an absolute menace to society. And obviously take pictures I can look back on at 3 in the morning when I can’t sleep. Idk if this helps in any way but sometimes I read gay fanfiction. (Currently on my 7th reread of He Chose Titans on Ao3) 

I have no idea where to even start looking. It’s my first time actually being alive after wasting so many years on drugs. Now I’ve a really good relationship with my mum and little brother and I’d like to visit the world with them. Starting with the EU as we live in Ireland. We are originally from Eastern Europe if that also helps.

1psy6t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1psy6t7/i_think_i_need_to_break_up_with_this_boy_im_seeing/,"I think I need to ""break up"" with this boy I'm seeing","I (F27) was in a 5-year relationship and have been single for over a year. I want to date again but take things slow. A friend has mentioned I might have avoidant tendencies, so I’m trying to be self-aware and not end things too quickly.

I matched with a guy (M26) on Hinge while I was traveling for 3 weeks. We chatted daily, but he texted a lot and kept messaging even when I wasn’t replying. I told him I want a serious relationship but slowly, and that I’d only know if we were compatible once we met in person.

When I got back, he wanted to pick me up from the airport. I said no, but he pushed to see me that day. I invited him over for coffee since I was tired (I have a male flatmate). He was sweet, brought chocolate, and didn’t push physically. We went on a couple more dates that week, including another night at my place watching a movie. There was no sex, it felt very intimate very fast, like we skipped the “going out and getting to know each other” phase.

The following week I was overwhelmed as any week after almost a month out of the office. Besides that it's Christmas this week, so we had some Christmas related events, like stupid company dinner. Also I getting my exercise routine back. I lift and run and I need it for my mental health, so I didn’t plan to see him because I simply didn't have any free days. I could see that it was bothering him, like he was waiting for any of my plans to fall down. 

On Friday, I was near his place but had yoga and dinner planned with a friend. He tried to change my plans and commented that maybe I didn't need yoga as I had gone to the gym already that week. I kinda ignored the comment and suggested to see each other Saturday but didn’t make concret plans.

On Saturday, I sent him a good morning message around 8am. I went to the gym, had lunch with a friend, then got caught in the rain and went home soaking wet and exhausted. When I checked my phone around 4pm, he had sent multiple messages saying he was waiting for me and implying I was always too busy. Btw... he woke up at 12pm.

I told him we hadn’t made concrete plans and that I felt pressured by all those messages. He sent many messages and called several times. I asked to talk the next day, because at that point all I wanted was a tea, a blanket and a movie, but he kept texting. The next morning I told him I needed to slow things down and that I couldn’t give him more right now. He liked the message but didn’t reply. That night he texted ""good night"" then followed up with more messages and called me five times while I was asleep.

I like him and think he’s kind, but the constant messaging, pressure, and difficulty respecting boundaries feel overwhelming. I’m unsure if this is my avoidant side reacting or if this is genuinely too much too soon. Any thoughts?",0,1766405885.0,dating_advice,10,0.5,False

If we will start offering tea, no one will drink coffee.**""

and they are providing space for kitty parties! It was super annoying. No hate for the aunties but atleast don't give them a mic.

You'd think that a big city would have the best and coziest coffee spots, and yes it does, but nowhere is like Fika. idk maybe i'm sentimental - I did all of my homework there, met friends, had dates, broke up with a boyfriend at the back booth, or maybe because it was open until 10pm, which even here in the city is extremely rare for coffee. so yeah, I'm flying home today and i'm genuinely so excited to go to Fika and I promise this is not a sponsor or some ad!!
