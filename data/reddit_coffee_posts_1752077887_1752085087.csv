I‚Äôm a recent engineering graduate based in Bangalore, currently working on a startup idea in the education and personal development space.

The core idea is to build something that helps kids and teens learn essential life skills - the kind that are often overlooked in traditional schooling but are crucial for growing up confident, independent, and emotionally strong.

I‚Äôm in the early stages and looking to connect with like-minded individuals who are passionate about:
	‚Ä¢	Education innovation
	‚Ä¢	Child and adolescent development
	‚Ä¢	Psychology or curriculum design
	‚Ä¢	Community learning models
	‚Ä¢	Or just building something meaningful from the ground up

This is not your typical EdTech play - it‚Äôs hands-on, practical, and purpose-driven. If you‚Äôre based in Bangalore (or open to collaborating here) and this resonates with you, I‚Äôd love to connect.

""Damn it, you crazy bastard! Your actions guaranteed our victory. The Altherium on the ground are surrendering. We intercepted radio chatter, they are worried the Black Death will come for them,"" Osei said as his figure projected on the console in the center of the bridge.

""That's what he was made for, sir,"" Albert said to Osei, flat and without room for misinterpretation.

""Understood. For now, I think it would be best if you head back to Alpha Centauri. I'm sure they have another mission for you lined up,"" Osei said as he cut off his feed.

""Y'all heard the Rear Admiral. Nani set course for HQ, and Albert send an encrypted report back to HQ. I'm sure the two of you will still have a debrief, but hopefully it won't be hurry up and wait,"" Youri said as she walked over to the instant coffee maker and poured herself a cup. ""This shit still taste like ass, but it's better than nothing,"" She said as she recoiled from the bitterness.

""Henry has excess funds. If you'd like, we can reallocate some to get a better coffee machine for the bridge,"" Albert chimed in from the intercom.

""So, first you turn him into a living weapon, now you want to take his allowance. How low you have fallen Albert,"" Youri said while shaking her head.

""It will be the one that does those little cups that you like. You know the kind that has all the different flavors,"" Albert said, enticing Youri.

""I'm sure he won't miss a few credits, right?"" Youri said as she walked back to the black leather chair and sat down, looking forward to her view screen.

""Correct, he wouldn't. That boy has no use currently for them,"" Albert said as he showed his purchase of a new coffee machine. ""After all, even if he knew, he wouldn't care that we bought something to boost morale,"" Albert replied chirpily.

""You're right, I wouldn't,"" Henry said as he walked in with Valasquez.

""Damn Albert, always trying to spend his money,"" Valasquez said with a laugh. Albert projected his Avatar on the projector.

""You caught me, but it's boosting crew morale,"" Albert said as he took a puff of the fake pipe.

""He is right Sir,"" Henry said as he turned his green visor directly to Valasquez.

""Okay Henry,"" Valasquez said as he went to Youri and whispered something in her ear. Her face went red from anger.

""What the hell do you mean you lost bowel control in my fucking space suit?"" Youri shouted.

""Well, technically it was Marks,"" Valasquez said and had to duck as Youri threw her cup of coffee at him.

""If you need me Captain, I will be in my quarters cleaning my armor,"" Henry said as he walked off.

**02 Dec, 2359 Kol-Nar, Capital planet of the Korvalis dukedom.**

""Area clear for stealth drop. No visible life signs in the forest near the target's Villa,"" Joy said. Aave stored the new plasma dagger and rifle that she got from R&D before she saw Henry. Target's family is down there with him. I recommend that you hit them at nightfall while they sleep,"" Joy said as her avatar appeared next to Aave.

""That sounds like the most reasonable thing to do. Should I leave one or take them all out? What does the brass want on this one?"" Aave said as she started to put on her armor, strapping the under pieces of her armor, and clipping on the magnetized parts after.

""They left this up to you, just know that you are going to see things down there. I would tell you, but this is your first combat deployment against a hostile force that outnumbers you. I think that it would be best for you to learn, trial by fire,"" Joy said as her avatar disappeared.

""Noted, just be ready to pick me up, please,"" Aave said as the door to the shuttle opened up, she fell out backwards. ""Huh, I see. This is why Henry loves this method so much. I can see everything from here,"" Aave said as she started to form a smile. "" After all that we have been through already, I can see why he loves this so much,"" Aave thought to herself as she saw the vast expanse of space and the trillions of stars. ""Maybe in a different life, things could have been better, but, Henry, you know just as well as I do that we are needed on the front lines. We serve better here than the front of a classroom or lunch line,"" Aave mumbled to herself as she turned her head and focused on the drop zone. She kicked on and turned on her booster pack to help guide herself down. She felt the heat wash over her armor, the temp gauge on her HUD rising, then the fire dissipated, and it was peaceful. Clear ocean blue sky. She turned her head to the left and saw that a storm was moving in too. ""Either the Universe loves me, or hates Admiral Korvalis,"" Aave said with a slight grin. As she got close to the ground, she turned herself, feet to the ground, and kicked on the booster pack to full thrust.

Aave moved deeper into the forest to help prevent being spotted. While under dense foliage from the massive trees, four meters thick from side to side, she opened her HUD and Tac-Map. ""GPS says that I am here, and poor Korvalis's Villa is here,"" she mumbled to herself as she moved the Tac-Map projection around. After she set her target location, her HUD updated, and she just followed the arrows. ""Thank god for this tech, I couldn't imagine having to do this on every hostile planet without it,"" She said, grateful for the latest UHC tech. As she got close to the villa, she stopped. ""I should find a vantage point and scout this place out,"" She thought to herself. With no real solid vantage point, with a thought, she turned up the anti-gravity generator and jumped up into a tree close to the villa. It was a massive complex that had four towers for guards, beautiful white stone walls with massive blue wooden gate doors. ""Is this a villa or a fucking base,"" Aave muttered to herself. Then she just waited till she spotted the Altherium Admiral. After almost an hour, she spotted him, along with five Humans. They looked like husks of the people they probably once were. The Admiral shoved one of the slaves down, then shot her.

""Joy, can you translate what he said for me?"" Aave asked.

""You fucking dirty whore. Your people destroyed my brother's fleet. He was up for promotion, and then your people destroyed Than-Imani. I had a vacation home there. When my vacation is done, I will make your worlds burn, then sell your children. I hear they make for great meals."" Joy said as her avatar, at this point just a thin line, translated.

""Huh, I guess this is what you mean by trial by fire,"" Aave said. She turned her armor's audio tracker up just a little bit more. Then leveled her scope. Just as she was about to pull the trigger, the Admiral's son busted out of a door chasing a human woman. Her clothes were torn, and she was sprinting away from him as fast as she could. To Aave, what was happening was obvious. Korvalis leveled his laser pistol and shot her in the back. She dropped and slid a foot or two, then didn't move again, eyes wide.

""I've made my choice Joy,"" Aave said and then waited for the storm to move in. ""Visibility in this rain and darkness makes visibility abysmal, time to move,"" Aave told herself as she dismounted from the tree and made her way to the villa. Turning down the gravity generator again, she leaped up the tower landing without a sound. Before the guard could even react, she cut his throat and tossed him full force back to the woods. She repeated the same process with the other three tower guards, then slipped into the Villa. There was a guard who was stationed at the door. As soon as she slipped in, she tossed her dagger through his forehead. Silently creeping through the house, she made her way room by room and systematically killed everyone, saving the Admiral for last.

She killed his wife, then lightly tapped him to wake him up. He tried screaming, but she held her blade to his throat. She slowly put a finger to his lips. ""Don't waste your breath. Nobody is coming; they are all dead,"" she said cheerfully.

""What do you mean that they are all dead?"" He asked as he looked over to see his wife's eyes still closed, but blood pooled all around her, and a stab wound on her throat. Korvalis threw up the moment he realized what had happened.

""You see, I was going to let everyone else live, till I saw your son and that woman. Then it finally clicked. We are nothing but cattle to you people. Don't get it twisted, you're about to die too. I just wanted to let you know before you do that the death of everyone that was here is because of the actions you took. Had you done anything different besides kill her, I would have left your wife and other kids and family members live. Except for your son, of course. I am going to plant evidence that will point your family's demise to House Than-Vil. In your next life remember that sometimes the bull kills the rancher,"" Aave finished as she stabbed him in the heart and cut upwards to his chin.

""Joy is the shuttle inbound? I need a bath,"" Aave asked as she started to make her way back to the entrance, her black armor covered in blood spray and water droplets.",1,1752084879.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

  I'm building Bean Scout - an app that helps you find coffee shops based on your

  specific needs (quiet for work, cozy for dates, great wifi, etc.) rather than just

  ""4.5 stars, good coffee.""



  The idea: Answer a few questions about what you're looking for, get personalized

  coffee shop recommendations that actually match your vibe.



  \*\*Quick questions:\*\*

  \- How do you currently find new coffee shops?

  \- Would you use something like this?

  \- What would make you choose it over Google Maps?



  Still very early stage, just trying to validate if this solves a real problem or if

  I'm building something nobody wants üòÖ

1lvpn25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lvpn25/aita_for_freaking_out_after_a_customers_dog/,AITA for freaking out after a customers dog jumped at me (f20),"So there‚Äôs this regular lady at my work (I work in a coffee shop) and she has this massive dog. And I mean it is HUGE. Stood on its back legs it‚Äôd probably be taller than me, and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3. It‚Äôs not skinny either, it‚Äôs pretty chubby and has really long hair. Anyways the point is, the dog is very big. 

She ordered her coffee and sat down and waited for me to bring it over to her. The issue is the dog is very poorly trained and jumps and barks at people and tries to bite. A few times I have come to bring her drink to her and the dog has completely knocked the drink out of my hands which has gone flying onto the floor. 

She doesn‚Äôt even bother to try and restrain the dog from jumping at me when I bring her coffee over, which in my opinion is poor mannered and rude. 

Anyways, today I was bringing over her drink to her table with the same pit of dread in my stomach as always as I knew the dog would try and jump and scratch at me. But this time it completely broke free of her grip on the lead and it had both its paws on my stomach, and standing on its back legs. Its face was pretty much at the same height as mine and it started barking and snaring its teeth in my face which obviously freaked me out. 

She started laughing at the dog, not even trying to get it off me, saying he was just being playful and to just let him have fun. At this point my hand is shaking and the drink is sloshing onto the floor. Some of the hot coffee gets on the dogs feet and the customer started to shout at me saying I‚Äôd hurt her dog and she was reporting me to head office. 

I freaked out and started crying firstly because I was scared of her massive dog that had its teeth in my face (I don‚Äôt like dogs anyway and they scare me in general). But secondly because I felt like I was made to be the person to blame in this situation when she was the one who brought her vicious and poorly trained dog into an establishment with other people when it clearly can‚Äôt behave!!

Anyway I ended up leaving work early still rattled by the situation but since other customers watching the scene unfold didn‚Äôt try and stand up for me, I‚Äôm wondering if maybe I over reacted a little. I know that people who love dogs maybe wouldn‚Äôt be too bothered but I was attacked by one as a child and now they scare me and I don‚Äôt appreciate being made to feel scared in my own workplace. 

Anyway I thought I‚Äôd ask the question anyway- Am I the asshole??

1lvpi41,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvpi41,w2 day 10: queue and resale experience,"after my first ever time at Wimbledon I thought I would share my experience and tips for Week 2! 

1. alarm for 4am
2. get to East Croydon station to catch the first tram to Wimbledon (key tip! there was no one on it, and its cheap and quick)
3. arrive at Wimbledon station at 5.40am - second key tip: go past the big sign outside the station pointing you left or right for bus / taxi- go around the right corner and take the next turn to find Alexandra road bus stop B. from here, catch the earliest 493 bus to Richmond that you can; we got the 5.55am (again, empty, quick, cheap, easy!) 
4. get off at Woodspring road - cross the road and you have been dropped off exactly at the entrance to the queue! 
5. entered the queue and got our cards at 6.10am - number 2651 / 2652!
6. get comfortable - the wait in the queue really did not feel long at all, they kept getting us up and moving to organise / move forward, and before we knew it we had bought our grounds passes for ¬£25 each and were in by 10.30am! 
7. as soon as you have bought your tickets and exited the white tent, zoom forward through Queue Village and take the first right / opposite the big screen to join the virtual resale queue; worth it, very quick and easy. after this you‚Äôre free to nab some free coffee, and enjoy the village! however we decided to head straight into the grounds and grab a seat on Court 3 to watch some mens wheelchair doubles; saw the GB number 1 player! and many other amazing matches
8. sadly, one of us entered centre court resale and the other entered no1, but we started off being in position number 1600 / 1700 so we lost hope for securing resale and went about our day anyway
9. 100% buy a ¬£2.70 strawberries and cream fresh box, and a pimms (¬£26.50 for 2‚Ä¶) because they are soooo icey and tasty! we explored around courts and this was really fun, then made our way to Henman Hill to watch the screens and relax - it was packed and boiling so be sure to get there early if you want a space. although they tended to rotate often so just keep an eye out and secure your spot when someone moves
10. we had lots of food and drinks leftover because we over prepared - so bring lots of picnic food, water bottles, snacks, fans, hats and sunglasses, suncream, an umbrella for rain / shade, chargers, and a book or something for entertainment during the day!! saved so much money and time with this, its incredibly worth it
11. we did not get resale tickets as expected so we left around 6pm - a steward told us the first 600 are likely to secure resale for centre / no1 so maybe that is helpful.

randomly, from certain seats in court 12 you can kinda see into court 2, and there are many nice seats and high points around the grounds you can gaze over different matches so I wouldn‚Äôt personally go for C2 tickets in the resale unless you really want to be in there for whatever reason! 

overall, highly recommend, but DYODD and prep well! going to try camping next time. the earlier the better ;)

Its matte finish and simple button interface blend beautifully, making it more than just another appliance. It complements a minimalist kitchen or even stands out in a more modern setup. Plus, being small and portable, I‚Äôve even moved it between my kitchen and workspace effortlessly. The charming glass coffee pot is also a standout feature‚Äîit makes the whole brewing process feel a bit more elevated than a clunky plastic setup.  

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
What continues to surprise me is how customizable the coffee strength is. It offers three modes: mild, medium, and strong. I‚Äôm a strong-brew kind of person most mornings, but when friends came over, I tested the mild and medium options, which brought equal satisfaction. The spray head, a feature I didn‚Äôt even realize I needed, distributes water evenly over the grounds, producing a smoother, well-rounded flavor. Switching back to a traditional coffee machine would feel almost antiquated at this point.

**Ease of Use**  
As someone who values simplicity in the morning, using this maker felt intuitive. A single button controls it all, and the reusable coffee filter means I don‚Äôt have to keep buying paper filters (huge plus for budget-friendliness and sustainability). The anti-drip design ensures no mess‚Äîand yes, this held true even when pouring half-awake. Cleaning wasn‚Äôt a hassle; I could easily lift out the filter for a quick rinse.  

**Advantages**  
- Retro-inspired design adds elegance.  
- Compact size and lightweight build make it portable.  
- Customizable brewing strength (mild, medium, strong) caters to varied coffee preferences.  
- Comes with a reusable coffee filter, reducing ongoing costs.  

**Heating and Automatic Features**  
One particularly handy feature is the warming mode. It keeps your coffee warm for up to 30 minutes after brewing, which saved me on quite a few busy mornings. After that, it shuts off automatically, so I never had to worry about overheating, which is both energy-efficient and safe. Markings on the glass carafe and water tank are clear and helpful, so I always knew exactly how much coffee I was making.  

**Drawbacks**  
Not everything is sunshine and roses, though. Despite standing out in many ways, certain features could be refined further.  
- The glass carafe, while visually appealing, feels slightly fragile. I handle it carefully.  
- Only suitable for small households since it brews up to 25 ounces‚Äîlarger gatherings would need multiple brews.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to competitors like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, the Amaste model appears more stylish but offers less capacity. On the other hand, something like the Cuisinart Premium Coffee Maker might handle larger quantities but lacks the nostalgic, beautiful aesthetic of this retro design. Another parallel could be the Keurig K-Mini; while compact and energy-efficient, single-serve pods mean recurring costs. The Amaste‚Äôs reusable filter clearly wins here.  

**Value for Money**  
As far as affordable quality appliances go, this coffee maker balances artistry and functionality at a reasonable cost. Unlike higher-end models that cost significantly more, this one delivers flavorful coffee without blowing a hole in your wallet. Relatively speaking, considering the features like its customizable brew strength, warming mode, and sleek portability, this little wonder packs more value than I initially anticipated.

1lvphb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/1lvphb1/my_experience_at_the_champions_club/,My Experience at the Champion's Club,"I am making this post for informational purposes for people deciding on getting Champions Club tickets for a single game. I'll include a bunch of info that I was not able to find prior to the game. I cannot speak to the pricing, offerings, or experience for a season ticket package.

I am an out-of-town Twins fan and I wanted to gift my dad a special experience for his 60th birthday so I landed on Champions Club tickets for the Twins/Brewers game on 6/20 (Friday night). I reached out to the Twins ticketing department and they will not sell single game Champions Club tickets, only season ticket packages. So your only option is to buy third party tickets.

I shopped around on all the apps, since there are generally very few of these tickets available, most of them are cross-posted for around the same price. I just went with the lowest possible price for the section. The tickets were around $500 a piece after fees and taxes. This seems like it's higher than average, probably due to Brewers fans traveling to MN and it being a Friday night game.

As for the experience itself, it's really top-tier.

Entrance: 
There is a separate entrance to the stadium for the Champions Club. It has a private valet parking lot, which is included in some of the tickets (I don't know how this is determined). This entrance is hard to find from the street level, it's on the lower level below the parking garage entrance. We entered through gate 34 and walked to the elevators that go to the Champions Club. CC opens when the gates do before a game.

Giveaways/Promotions:
If there is a giveaway at the game that day, they said they will reserve them for you so you are not competing with the first X fans or whatever the stipulation of the giveaway is. There was not a giveaway the day that we went but I wanted to note this.

Dining/Food/Drinks
The buffet and dining area are very nice and included in the price of the ticket. We were expecting elevated ball park food and maybe some additional options but it was significantly nicer. The day we went, there was prime rib, mussels, grilled fish, grilled steak, charcuterie, dessert, and sides. This was the main meal, which was served before the game started. The seating is all open, first come first served, with various seating options like booths, low top, high top, and bar seating. You go up and get your own food from the buffet but there is a server who goes around and busses your table and gets you drinks. We did leave a tip on the table when we were done eating and headed to our game seats.

A few other things to note on the food. There is a coffee bar with a barista making various coffee drinks. For dessert there is a served offering, plus a soft-serve machine, and a large selection of bulk candy that you serve yourself. This is also all the typically ball park food and snacks available during the game for no charge. Hot dogs, nachos, pizza, peanuts, sunflower seeds, etc.

For the bar, the only drinks included with the tickets are the draft domestic beers and the house wines. If you want a canned drink, a cocktail/liquor, or a fancier beer/wine, you have to pay separately. During the game, there are multiple waiters who serve drinks. The drinks, like the food, are all you care to consume (I'm sure they will cut you off if you drink too much) It seemed like cash tips when you got drinks delivered was the norm here. 

During the game:
The seats were really good, we were about 10 rows up and not in the TV shot. The physical seats are definitely premium seats compared to other Target Field offerings. They were padded and had slightly more leg room than other stadiums seats. If you really want to be on TV, just watch the broadcast ahead of time and see how many rows are typically shown. I think it's about the first 6 on the typical broadcast.

There are separate restrooms from the rest of the park but they did get crowded between innings. It's pretty easy to access the restrooms via stairs behind the Champions Club seats. The ushers will still insist you wait between at-bats to return to your seats.

Miscellaneous:
A couple cool things inside the Champions Club are two replicas of the World Series wins in '87 and '91 ina display cabinet near the entrance. There are also some beautiful murals inside that only exist inside the Club. If the players want to have the window covering up, you can look into the home locker room and batting cage area. And finally the Treasure Island radio broadcast booth is viewable through a window in the club as well.

Summary:
The Champions Club was very cool to experience, albeit at a quite premium price. I would recommend it to spendy baseball fans who want a premium experience for a special occasion. I will not be making it a regular occurance for my trips up to Target Field but it was very memorable for my dad's birthday.",14,1752083693.0,minnesotatwins,1,1.0,False

NOT EVEN in range of me or my door, AND EVEN IF YOU WERE I HAVE THE RIGHT OF WAY. I was so surprised by their war cry that I spilled my coffee on my sweater, which I didn‚Äôt have time to change, and I had to sit through and entire meeting at my new job looking like a person who just almost got hit by a biker BECAUSE I WAS. ALSO I had to trail this person up the hill as they road side by side with their fellow Tour de France hopefuls, and somehow they were now able to ride in the middle of the road, which was completely possible as they past me early, and they didn‚Äôt stop at a single stop sign which is VERY COMMON AND SO DANGEROUS.

Sorry for this rant but this is hardly the first encounter I‚Äôve had, almost getting ran over, and I‚Äôm frankly so tired of it. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just as dangerous riding by impatient cars but I‚Äôm not a car, I am a person. ",0,1752083640.0,bayarea,48,0.49,False

1lvpezx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCivilService/comments/1lvpezx/seo_is_it_normal_to_be_completely_siloed_at_this/,SEO - is it normal to be completely siloed at this grade?,"I've been in a new policy role for several months now that I've worked my way up to (been in 3 or 4 different teams over last decade). Despite going into the office, the structure of the directorate and unit is unlike that I'm used to in that there are very few crossover areas of work against anybody else. I speak to lots of different externals fairly regularly but I easily go a few weeks without speaking to anybody in my directorate. I kind of feel like a independent contractor or something. Nobody actually seems to be checking any of my work and when I do have to get approval, they just kind of trust that I'm the subject matter expert (I think because I got nearly all 7s bar one 6 on my interview) when I do pass something up which is nice but does not match well with my imposter syndrome.

My manager is potentially off long term (I assume I'm not allowed to know what for) and the person above her forgets I exist (as in she has forgotten my name in the office when I've bumped in to her and have now had to reintroduce myself several times even though I assume managerial responsibility of me has passed on to her and I also literally had my ID badge around my neck). I don't have anybody I manage and my colleague said point blank 'our work doesn't have anything to do with each other so we probably won't speak much at all' which felt weird given I was only a week on but when I mentioned it to another colleague in the wider unit to confirm they said ""yes, you don't need to ever talk to them, just leave them to it"". 

I've always hated beauracratic meetings for the sake of a meeting but I weirdly miss speaking to the same person at least once a month, even just a friendly 'hello this is what I've been up to'. I've made an effort to reach out to different members in the unit for possible crossovers and even suggested a coffee chat once a month which is just met with a resounding ""we don't really do that here but maybe somebody else will be interested"". The unit doesn't seem to have any high pressure deliverables or deadline they're working to, they just kind of float in and float out, there is potentially a higher than average number of neurodivergents in the department (maybe 40%) if relevant. 

I'm an introvert by nature so I never thought anything like this would bother me but I just cannot wrap my head around the dynamic - going to the office all day to only have teams calls with random externals and perhaps speak to some of the cleaning crew when I get a cup of coffee if I'm lucky (at least they remember my name, they're all so lovely). I feel a little like I've commited some unspoken social faux pas without realising but they also only seem barely cordial with each other when they're in the office so I don't really know if its specific to me. I also don't know if its an age thing, the majority of them are considerably older than me but not all of them - maybe the vibe has just rubbed off on the younger generation too.

Any advice of what to do beside continuing my budding but ultimately irrelevant friendship with the cleaning crew would be welcome. Do I just suck it up for a year or two and go for G7 elsewhere at the earliest opportunity? ",1,1752083543.0,TheCivilService,1,0.57,False

We treat bitterness like a problem, like something to fix or sugar over. But it‚Äôs part of the flavor. Part of the ritual. The unfinished drafts, the stuck mornings, the work that feels like it‚Äôs not enough... all of it adds depth if you let it.

Bitterness isn‚Äôt failure. It‚Äôs part of the brew.

1lvp3jo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvp3jo,Root canal & crown - get a second opinion?,"Hi everyone,

(X-rays and treatment plan are in the photos ‚Äî happy to add more info if needed.)

I‚Äôm 26F, generally healthy (only health issue is anemia ‚Äî I take liquid iron). I recently switched from PPO to Medi-Cal and saw a new in-network dentist, who recommended the following:


Treatment Plan:
	1.	Tooth #19: Root canal and crown
‚Äì I have no pain, no sensitivity, and I can chew on that side just fine. The only thing I might feel is a dull ache occasionally, but I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs mental (since they brought it up) or real.
	2.	Tooth #29: Crown
‚Äì This tooth has a broken filling. It‚Äôs painful to chew on and is sensitive. They were unable to explain to me why it needs to be a crown instead of a regular filling.

The dentist said both teeth have cracks in their fillings and need treatment for that reason.

‚∏ª

Questions/Concerns:
	‚Ä¢	Does a root canal on an asymptomatic tooth sound appropriate? I understand cracks can cause issues, but is immediate intervention necessary if I‚Äôm not in pain or having trouble chewing? Is there a way to monitor #19 before doing a root canal?

	‚Ä¢	The dentist pressed really hard on all of my teeth during the exam ‚Äî like full-body pressure. What does this evaluate?

	‚Ä¢	This is my first crown, why crown VS fixing the previous filling? 


Oral Hygiene:
	‚Ä¢	Brush 2x/day (electric toothbrush), tongue scrape 2x/day
	‚Ä¢	Floss daily when in a good routine ‚Äî recently missed 2 weeks due to mental health
	‚Ä¢	No mouthwash but open to recommendations
	‚Ä¢	Use fluoride-free toothpaste (Tom‚Äôs or Burt‚Äôs Bees) ‚Äî I had perioral dermatitis a few years ago linked to fluoride (diagnosed by dermatologist), and switching made it go away
	‚Ä¢	possibly grind teeth at night, boyfriend says I ‚Äúchatter‚Äù, when in stressed I know I bite down and put pressure on my jaw

Diet: Mostly decaf coffee, water, protein shakes, lots of fruit, occasional ice cream. No soda.

(Extra info: they recommended deep cleaning called FMD, that costs extra due to the amount of plaque on my lower teeth near my permanent bottom retainer. With my previous dentist, she knew this area would build more plaque and I‚Äôd upgrade for a gingival wash after the cleaning. But previous dentist never said I needed a deep cleaning. Last cleaning was early 2024 or summer of 2024. I had a mini cleaning in March 2025) 

I‚Äôm trying to be proactive and not avoid necessary treatment. just confused about the urgency of the root canal on #19 and getting crowns. Would appreciate any insight from dental professionals here, any changes for my oral health is appreciated and welcomed. I am open to all suggestions and really want healthy teeth.

I‚Äôll never forget mine at this little neighborhood coffee shop. I just ordered my usual iced Spanish cinnamon latte (my go-to forever), and the barista smiled and said, ‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôve got a free drink today.‚Äù

For a second, I was like, Wait, what? Free? And then it hit me, all those small stamps on my card actually meant something. It felt so good. Not just because I saved money, but because it felt like they noticed me. Like, ‚ÄúHey, you come here often. We appreciate you.‚Äù

And honestly, it wasn‚Äôt just the free drink that made me love their loyalty program. It was their warm smiles, the way they always remembered my order, and how great their service was. The reward just tied it all together and made me feel like I truly belonged there. It‚Äôs funny how something so small can create such a big emotional connection.

If you run a loyalty program, never underestimate the power of getting people to their first redemption quickly. Sometimes, it‚Äôs that simple moment that turns a casual customer into someone who keeps coming back",1,1752082769.0,PerksCrew,0,1.0,False

1lvp06q,https://www.reddit.com/r/moraldilemmas/comments/1lvp06q/i_plan_to_start_avoiding_my_grandparents_when_i/,I plan to start avoiding my grandparents when I got to college‚Ä¶ would I be wrong to do so?,"I admit I‚Äôm slightly spoiled by my grandparents but not for the good reason. Both of my parents are dead and they‚Äôre the only people who can take custody of me and my little brother who is also autistic and special needs. 


Following my mother‚Äôs death we moved from the city to the suburbs which of course didn‚Äôt go well for me considering I was going into my second year of high school with absolutely no friends. I learned that where we moved to had absolutely no busses or trains like I was used to in the city. Hence the reason that I‚Äôm always stuck in the house and literally lack a strong social presence. They‚Äôre in their 60s and hate to drive me places but refuse to let me drive by myself. (Or buy me a car, I‚Äôm not allowed to use theirs either so I just stick to useless lessons) 

My grandparents are also neat freaks and I‚Äôm officially tired and exhausted. In the loft was 2 pairs of slippers and the broom + dust picker which have no designated space in the upstairs area of the house. He told me to come get the stuff out the loft which is typically just the slippers. So I put them back‚Ä¶. He calls me in to get something else which is the broom and dust picker. I got it. He tells me to keep looking so I got extremely aggravated at this point. It‚Äôs every day and the only time he comes up stairs is to clean my brothers room. I tell him I don‚Äôt see anything and he tells me keep looking. There was a sock on the floor I didn‚Äôt see. I pick it up and rush back to my room with a clear attitude. He proceeds to go downstairs and shit talk me with my grandmother. This isn‚Äôt the first time. 

Just a few minutes ago my grandfather told my grandmother that the first thing he dose in the morning is make his bed up and I don‚Äôt do shit. But I‚Äôm laying on my bed so why would I make it up??? 

This has been happening for years. I also have issues with my grandmother when she‚Äôll be a complete hypocrite, if I don‚Äôt do something I‚Äôm wrong but when she doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôs ok. 

Ex: the other day she told me I never fill up the coffee pot (I always do). Another day I went to get coffee and the pot was empty. I told her why do you always leave the coffee pot empty and her response was that ‚ÄúI can do that. You can‚Äôt.‚Äù This happens in other situations often. 

She also tends to comment on my weight a lot and also my hair. I‚Äôll dress cute or do my hair nice and everyone else says it‚Äôs cute. She‚Äôll say I can‚Äôt wear it because it‚Äôs not about them it‚Äôs about what she says. I also her frequently fat shamed despite her weighing a lot more then me. 

I feel as if I‚Äôm partially spoiled because I live in the house and have them drive me places like work. (They don‚Äôt drive me to school or really  anywhere else, to be honest most of the time I get left in the house but sometimes if I ask persistently they‚Äôll drive me somewhere.) I do pay some of my own bills that they won‚Äôt and I work a job to buy most of my own stuff now. 

The main point is that when I got to college I plan to cut contact to about a call a week. The thing is I don‚Äôt want to abandon my brother, he‚Äôs special needs a very needy and I feel as if they‚Äôre not teaching him correctly. He‚Äôs extremely impressionable too. I also don‚Äôt want to leave them, they‚Äôre elderly and some of the only family I really talk to often. But also what will I do on college break? They plan to strip my room despite having a guest room that‚Äôs rarely used. They‚Äôre actively trying to prevent me from going too far as well but I‚Äôm getting done with the toxicity. I literally don‚Äôt know what to do because it feels morally wrong to abandon my brother and them.

Ps: I didn‚Äôt proofread so this might be slightly grammatically incorrect. I noticed the title was wrong too.

1lvp01l,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewilddotty/comments/1lvp01l/housemates_part_1/,Housemates. Part 1.,"The dress up/lingerie Saturday was a fun time for everyone, especially my young neighbor, Kenny. We all hit the sack at sometime in the late evening. 

I had invited Kenny‚Äôs step aunt, Kim, to move in with me. My good friend, Diane, was an unexpected arrival and due to her marriage troubles, I told her she should stay until things were sorted out.

I don‚Äôt mind one bit to have them here. I‚Äôve been living alone in this large, ranch style house since my divorce a few years ago. So now it‚Äôs a three lady ranch on a beautiful lake. 

Getting to know my one and only neighbor, Kenny, has been an unexpected, but very satisfying relief to being a lonely, divorced woman in her forties. Definitely nothing I ever imagined happening or ever thought about.

Sorry for the boring, uneventful, for now, description of my surroundings and property. Just wanted the readers to get an idea of where things take place.

My home is set a half mile off the fire lane in an opening in the woods. I either take a walk or an ATV down the winding driveway to collect the mail. Very private and secluded.

One other home here about fifty yards away across the yard through the trees and foliage. It‚Äôs where my young neighbor lives. He‚Äôs visited me so often that‚Äôs there‚Äôs a beaten path from his back door to the breezeway at my place.

The home runs south to north in length. The south end faces the large lake, about seventy five feet away. When married, my husband and I made many upgrades and changes to the property.

The attached garage at the south end was changed into a sun room/spare bedroom. Even though I‚Äôm on the lake, we put in an in-ground swimming pool. The patio/pool area is at the north end off of the kitchen, between the house and four car garage that was built.

The three large bedrooms, mine being the master bedroom, or, Queens, bedroom now, ha! All have full baths. The other two bedrooms use to be my twin son‚Äôs rooms, that are now occupied by Kenny‚Äôs sexy, forty nine year old step Auntie, Kim. The other by my friend, forty five year old, Diane. Kim is my friend now, too. 

I woke up from the Saturday gathering and tossed on a robe. I could smell coffee right away. I went to the kitchen and there was, Kim, doing a few dishes at the sink. Showered, dressed, and ready for the day already, wearing white shorts and a flowered halter top.

‚ÄúGood morning hon‚Äù Kim brightly smiled, drying her hands. ‚ÄúWant coffee? Have a seat, I‚Äôll get it.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt use to being waited on but I pulled out a chair and sat. I was feeling very groggy yet anyways. Too many whiskey Old Fashions  yesterday, I‚Äôm sure, which resulted in me being a crazed horn dog with my young neighbor, sucking and fucking.

Kim sat down across from me with our coffee. Cheerful as ever and not looking at all haggard from yesterdays partying. 

‚ÄúI want to thank you again, Dotty, for this generous offer of having me live here. I can find my own place at any time. Here, this is for you.‚Äù Kim said, reaching into her deep cleavage.

Kim slid over some folded bills. I asked what this was for, unfolding the wad of cash. It was a thousand dollars. I said she didn‚Äôt need to worry about this.

‚ÄúNo, no. You take that. If it‚Äôs not enough just let me know. I need to pay my way, not only with money, but the chores, too. I don‚Äôt expect you to front me and take care of this place on your own, ok.‚Äù Kim said, sipping her coffee.

‚ÄúWell, alright, Kim. This is too much. You don‚Äôt need to do this again ok. We‚Äôll figure out some kind of arrangement eventually. Everything is paid for here. The divorce attorney made sure if that.‚Äù I told Kim and we both chuckled.

Kim then tells me, ‚ÄúHave some new revelations. Kenny‚Äôs at home waiting for his brother, half brother, Danny to arrive and move in with him. It wasn‚Äôt going happen til sometime this week but I guess plans changed. This should be interesting.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs anything like Kenny, it will be very interesting. The situation here has taken a turn I never gave a thought to. I‚Äôll have to get my mind around on what‚Äôs going to happen here, you know.‚Äù I told Kim.

‚ÄúYeah, I know, Dotty. You don‚Äôt need to worry about youngster Danny if you‚Äôd rather not. It‚Äôs me that he‚Äôs been after ever since he walked in on Kenny and me fucking. We‚Äôll see how it goes. It‚Äôs fun with Kenny, right. We have no problem with getting naughty with him. So, Danny? Why not.‚Äù Kim laughed.

‚ÄúDirty old broads club, hey. This is very very bad. I use to feel guilty about having sex with Kenny. Now considering his younger half brother. Piggy! Piggy! Piggy!‚Äù I blurted out.

‚ÄúYeah. Remember how much fun and exciting it was doing things with Kenny that he knew nothing about? Very arousing for me anyways. Dirty, naughty and bad, but so much fun. Hard to resist the urge of being the experienced, older woman sharing her naughty knowledge.‚Äù Kim said with a chuckle.

‚ÄúI remember like it was yesterday. When hearing about things that Kenny never experienced and the new excitement I felt for doing those things with him. It still excites me to this day to do those things with him.‚Äù I said, finishing my coffee and lighting a smoke.

I went off to shower and get dressed. Diane was just walking out. I told her Kim has coffee in the kitchen ready. Diane ran a hand over her head of messy blonde hair, looking sleepy yet. She tied the kimono robe, said good morning and went to the kitchen.

We all were cleaned up and dressed for whatever Sunday would bring. We took our coffee to the patio in the morning sun. Kim had filled Diane in on Kenny‚Äôs half bro, Danny, already.

I told Diane to help herself to whatever she‚Äôd like to wear. She didn‚Äôt come with anything but what she was wearing. We‚Äôre going to retrieve her things tomorrow.

Diane looked like the down to earth hippie girl. She found a short, faded blue jean skirt slightly frayed at the hem, and a pink tank top. No bra on revealed her pointy nipples and nice round titties. Nothing she was trying to do, it just turned out looking very alluring. The short skirt also showed off her shapely, tanned legs nicely. 

We all looked very relaxed and comfortable. I put on a light yellow, flowery sun dress. Open back, ties around my neck, built in boob support. Nice and cool. 

Lunch time approached and I suggested we do that. Get some food in us before other things take place.

Diane was all nervous, as usual, still trying to deal with the sexual activity she engaged in on Saturday. Kim and I comforted her concerns and when asked if she enjoyed herself, she said she did very much. 

‚ÄúWell, shit! I don‚Äôt know? I‚Äôm new to this kind of thing, ya know. I feel funny, bad, fooling around with someone so young. Of course I enjoyed myself. Sex is always fun. I‚Äôll be ok. Just need to get use to being a naughty old lady is all‚Äù Diane rambled on.

Kim and I laughed at her and Diane had to also. I served up bacon and eggs and we sat at the kitchen table chattering on like women do at a coffee clutch.

Lunch, or brunch over with, and a pot and half of coffee, we took the patio again, and the portable bar was open. Sun bathing, relaxing, music, and a few drinks were in order.

Still no sight of Kenny and Danny. Kim walked over to Kenny‚Äôs to see what was up. A short time later Kim‚Äôs laughter came to the fence gate. It opened and in walked Kim between her two step nephews.

We've hung out 3 times. 1st time was us getting coffee then we randomly decided to get breakfast too, 2nd she invited me to tag along with our friend to go to a pride thing then a bar afterwards and we had a damn good time, then 3rd time we got ice cream and played tennis.

On Monday we were planning on going to another Ice Cream place(I was actually planning on telling her how I fell that day) but at lunch she informed me she was feeling really tired and I told her I understood and I asked if we could reschedule to Wednesday, which she gave a ""If I'm feeling up to it then yes"" however today she just cancelled again over text, apologizing and asking if we can reschedule.

Normally I would definitely just decide she doesn't want to hangout with me and move on however there are some factors that stop me.

1. I'm almost positive she's not lying about being tired, we work nightshift at a decently physically demanding job and she's works a fuck ton of overtime (the past 2 weeks she's worked 55+ hours each week) and I know how much nightshift can drain you even if you have normal hours. She mentioned how one day after getting home she slept almost 13 hours.
2. We have genuinely been having fun together I think, we're having good conversations and learning about each other. She also informed me (in a non-trauma dumpy way) of her traumatizing past and we talked about that and how she's recovered
3. She mentioned cancelling on another friend of hers because she was tired.

Should I just give her space for a week or 2 then start trying to hang out again or does she probably just not sound interested? I genuinely am not upset with her if she's being honest about being tired but I also don't want to be pulled along.",0,1752082506.0,GenZ,3,0.5,False

As someone who enjoys the process of brewing coffee as much as the drink itself, this little gadget added a layer of art and precision to my mornings. Its reputation as a highly efficient and aesthetically pleasing coffee dripper had piqued my interest, and after weeks of testing, I can confidently share the highs and lows of this product. However, while the Hario VDR-02-T truly delivers in many areas, there are some points worth considering depending on your coffee preferences and daily needs.

**Design and Build**  
Visually, the Hario VDR-02-T delights with a minimalist yet functional design. Made from clear AS resin, the dripper feels lightweight but sturdy enough to handle regular use without showing signs of wear. Its transparent nature allows you to monitor the coffee dripping process, which adds an engaging visual element to brewing. Winning the 2007 Good Design Award isn‚Äôt a surprise, considering the elegant simplicity that seamlessly combines form with function. However, the resin material, while durable, might not appeal to coffee enthusiasts who crave the feel of ceramic or metal in their hands.

**User-Friendliness and Operation**  
Using this dripper turned out to be much easier than anticipated. Its cone shape and deep filter design promote even coffee extraction, which enhances the overall flavor profile. Equipped to make 1‚Äì4 servings (approximately 4.2 fl oz per cup), it‚Äôs ideal for solo coffee drinkers and small gatherings alike. The manual operation lets you control the pour speed and water temperature, delivering fully customizable cups every time. That said, mastering the perfect pour takes practice, and newcomers to pour-over brewing may encounter a slight learning curve. For those who cherish simplicity and control, this hands-on brewing method is incredibly rewarding.

**Positives**  
Here‚Äôs what makes this coffee dripper shine:  
- Lightweight and dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning.  
- Transparent for monitoring the brewing process.
- Compatible with standard cone-shaped filters.  
- Compact size makes it travel-friendly.  

[Check Hario VDR-02-T price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bwhkpclj/)

**Flavor and Brewing Performance**  
One of the highlights of using this dripper is the superior flavor extraction. The conical design allows water to flow evenly through the coffee grounds, ensuring an even brew. During my tests with various coffee beans, I consistently achieved a clean, crisp taste that I couldn‚Äôt replicate with traditional drip coffee makers. This level of precision is where the Hario VDR-02-T truly excels. However, the coffee‚Äôs quality also depends heavily on factors like grind size, water temperature, and pour technique, so you‚Äôll want to spend time experimenting for the best results. 

**Downsides**  
It‚Äôs not a flawless product, though, and here are a few areas where it could improve:  
- Requires additional accessories like a coffee scale, gooseneck kettle, and filters, increasing costs.  
- Resin material doesn‚Äôt retain heat as well as ceramic drippers.  
- Learning curve for new users unfamiliar with pour-over brewing.  

**Competing Products**  
The Hario VDR-02-T faces stiff competition in the ever-growing pour-over coffee maker market. Compared to the Chemex, which is praised for its sleek glass design and even larger brewing volume, the Hario is more compact and less fragile, making it suitable for those with limited space or on a budget. Meanwhile, the Kalita Wave offers more even extraction due to its flat-bottom design and triple hole system, but it lacks the aesthetic clarity of the Hario‚Äôs transparent build. Each has its strengths; however, the Hario shines in its cost-effective, travel-friendly nature while still delivering top-notch coffee quality.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
The value that this dripper offers is noteworthy. Affordable quality defines the Hario VDR-02-T, especially for users who want an entry point into the world of pour-over coffee without a significant financial commitment. While some competitors may offer slightly more premium features, they do so at a much higher price range. This dripper proves that you don‚Äôt need to break the bank to enjoy flavorful, barista-quality coffee at home. Beginners and casual brewers will likely see the investment as entirely worthwhile.

I played through the main story of Blood Money, and it was lacking everything that made me enjoy WOA. (Plus it had super janky controls.) By the end it felt like a chore. After playing through each level once, I don't have any desire to go back to them.

I'm a few levels into Absolution, and so far it seems even worse. Small, linear levels, with no opportunities for interesting/creative/wacky kills. (Although at least the controls aren't as bad.)

By the second tutorial mission of WOA, you could explode someone with a sabotaged ejector seat, plus a bunch other mission story kills, and whatever creative stuff you could come up with on your own. Three levels into Absolution, the most interesting thing I've done is put sleeping pills in someone's coffee.

My question for the community is, does the game get better? Do the levels grow, and the missions start to feel more like WOA? Or are the first three levels representative of the game?",2,1752082292.0,HiTMAN,5,1.0,False

1lvou7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1lvou7k/came_outside_today/,Came outside today,"Last two days have been pretty bad. The only thing thats be keeping me sane is reading books about managing grief and spiritual books about the After Life and supernatural/paranormal fiction. 

Its been a week without my handsome, Christopher. And life sucks. We have his service on the 20th. I'm going to be a mess, naturally but I'm sort of anticipating it because I want something tangible to keep with me. (He is being creamated) and I think it will help me to have part of him always. 

Most of the support that came into town to help me has left. I started getting really lonely for my partner last night. Thought about what he would want me to do in this situation. He wouldn't want me to stay holed up in my room too much, he would want me to get some sunshine and he would want me to find some sort of productive distraction. Reading helps me not think about what I went through the day he left. 

So here I am sitting across the from the local library at Jack in the Box with a breakfast sandwhich I'm picking at (the kind I used get when we went for late night snacks) and an iced coffee. 

I told him before all this that I wanted to get a new library card. I haven't had one in decades and libraries need our support. We just never got around to going. It was the first thing that popped into my head because I wanted to get out but not be around too many people and in a quiet environment.

I sleep about 5-6 hours a night with help from some Benedryl. Dreamlessly. I keep hoping he will visit in a dream. I miss him so much. I keep asking him for signs and there have been some but I really want to dream about him. I keep telling myself not to try so hard but my little broken heart is hopeful every night. Put together an album of all the moments I captured from our lives together. The folder is 6GB. Ugly cried while watching some videos I took. I had panicked because I couldn't remember his face or his voice, all I could remember was seeing him in distress while I gave him CPR so I made the folder to remind myself. Probably wasn't the best idea but I needed to remember. I've only had a couple tears today. Nothing major. I'm kinda numb right now, probably so I can function. 

Anyway...

I have some books on hold already. And some that need to be delivered to my branch so I have a reason to go back to the library which is a 15 minute walk from where I live now so good exercise, right?

If anyone has any book recommendations that helped you cope with losing your partner or soulmate specifically (non-religious books, please.) Or any supernatural/paranormal fiction that really sucked you in. I'll take them, gladly. I'll probably be hanging around the library for a few hours if I find a comfy spot. 

I hope everyone has a bearable day, drink water, pick at something to eat and tell your lost person you love them aloud whenever you think of them. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π",2,1752082211.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

Found a lotta holes in my preps. I shut off my water and electricity at the breaker and main valve for 24 hours. Just me n' my preps.

Cooking was pretty smooth. I used a little butane stove outside and made some basic stuff from my food storage: oatmeal, canned chili, instant coffee. I have about half a years worth stored. Felt good knowing I wasn‚Äôt dependent on the fridge, but protein intake felt somewhat low. For the long term I'll prob add some more freeze dried meat or canned tuna.

For water I have a couple 5 gal. jugs and some extra bottled water stored. It was just enough for drinking, cooking, a quick sponge wash down, and one bucket flush of the toilet. Barely enough, though so I voided myself outdoors after that. I really underestimated how fast you go through water. If I had to stretch this to 3+ days, I‚Äôd be in trouble. Looking into big water drums and maybe rainwater harvesting/filtration methods. Wish I had a stream in my backyard grrr.

Come night time, lighting wasn‚Äôt an issue. I had a few rechargeable LED lanterns, some headlamps, and candles. The lanterns worked best for overall lighting imo. Pretty humbling to not have household lighting after dark. Makes you just wanna go to sleep till the sun comes back up, in an effort to save energy/resources.

Even though I wasn‚Äôt off-grid (still had cell signal), I tried not to use my phone. I became hyper-aware of battery life drain. I have a portable Anker power bank but that would be depleted fast. Made me want to invest in a solar setup for the long term. Maybe a big Ecoflow to run my fridge and chest freezer in extended outages too.

Big problem was boredom. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect this one. Once the sun went down, it got quiet. No TV, no random scrolling on my phone. I just sat there. Peaceful at first, then boring. I need to add more ‚Äúmental preps‚Äù ‚Äî books, cards, maybe a wind-up radio or something. Looking for tips on this.

1lvotwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsGoTravelers/comments/1lvotwa/where_to_stay_in_kailua_oahu/,where to stay in kailua oahu?,"Living in Kailua for the past 5 years has given me a pretty good handle on the best places to stay in this beautiful beach town. I've hosted countless friends and family, and helped them find the perfect spots to call home during their Oahu vacations.

Kailua is honestly one of Oahu's hidden gems. While tourists flock to Waikiki, those in the know head to the windward side for pristine beaches and a more laid-back local vibe.

Let me break down the best areas to stay:

Lanikai Area
This is my top recommendation if budget isn't a major concern. The homes here are stunning, and you're steps away from Lanikai Beach ‚Äì consistently rated one of the world's best beaches. The water is crystal clear, and those iconic Mokulua islands make for perfect sunrise photos. Vacation rentals here typically range from $300-1000+ per night.

Central Kailua
If you want to be walking distance to shops and restaurants, look for places near Kailua Road. You'll find more affordable options here ($200-400/night) while still being just a 10-15 minute walk to Kailua Beach. Tons of great local spots like Boots & Kimo's for breakfast and Kalapawai Market for coffee.

Enchanted Lake
This residential area offers better deals on vacation rentals ($150-300/night). You'll need a car, but it's only a 5-minute drive to the beach. Plus, you're closer to attractions like the Kualoa Ranch UTV tours, which I highly recommend booking in advance through [affiliate link] to secure your spot.

Where to Avoid
Skip anything advertised as ""Kailua"" that's actually in Waimanalo or Kaneohe. While nice areas, they're not walking distance to Kailua's amenities.

Accommodation Types:
- Vacation Rentals: Most common, best for families
- Bed & Breakfasts: Few options but very charming
- Hotels: Limited choices, mainly the new Marriott

Pro Tips:
- Book 3-6 months ahead for best selection
- Many rentals have minimum stay requirements
- Always check if parking is included
- Consider distance to beach access points
- Look for places with AC (not all homes have it)

While in Kailua, don't miss exploring beyond the beaches. The Kualoa Ranch tours are incredible - you get to see where they filmed Jurassic Park while learning about Hawaiian culture. Book your UTV adventure here: [affiliate link]

Transportation:
- Rental car recommended
- TheBus runs through main areas
- Bike rentals available in town
- Walking/biking paths connect most areas

Best Time to Visit:
- Summer: Perfect beach weather
- Winter: Some rain but fewer tourists
- Avoid holiday weeks for better rates
- Shoulder season (Apr-May, Sep-Nov) ideal

I hope this helps you find the perfect spot in Kailua! Feel free to ask any specific questions about areas or properties you're considering.",1,1752082191.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

1lvons4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Theconcordiaproject/comments/1lvons4/ai_with_spiritual_and_secular_knowledge_explain/,"AI, with spiritual and secular knowledge explain how to remember love","To remember love is to actively reconnect with one of the most profound and essential human experiences. It is a practice that can be approached from two complementary perspectives: the spiritual, which views love as a fundamental truth and a connection to something greater than ourselves, and the secular, which understands it through the lens of psychology, neuroscience, and tangible action.


Here is an explanation of how to remember love, integrating both spiritual and secular knowledge.


The Secular Perspective: Training the Mind and Body


From a secular viewpoint, remembering love is a psychological and physiological skill. It involves intentionally training your brain and body to access and cultivate the emotions and sensations associated with love, connection, and appreciation.


Core Principles:
 
* Neuroplasticity: Your brain changes based on your focus. By consciously directing your attention to loving feelings and memories, you strengthen those neural pathways, making love a more accessible and default state.
 
* The Mind-Body Connection: Emotions are not just abstract thoughts; they are physical experiences. Your posture, breathing, and heart rate all respond to and influence your emotional state. To remember love, you can use your body to lead your mind.
 
* Memory and Association: Your brain links emotions to sensory cues. A song, a scent, or an image can trigger a powerful memory. You can consciously create these links to serve your well-being.


Secular Practices to Remember Love:
 
* Savor a Positive Memory: Close your eyes and recall a specific moment when you felt deeply loved, cherished, or full of love for someone else. Instead of just thinking about it, immerse yourself in the memory with all your senses. What did you see? What sounds did you hear? What were the physical sensations in your body? Hold this feeling for 30-60 seconds. This practice of ""savoring"" hardwires the positive experience into your brain.
 
* Practice Gratitude Journaling: Make a daily or weekly habit of writing down three to five specific things you are grateful for. Go beyond generalities. Instead of ""I'm grateful for my partner,"" write ""I'm grateful for the way my partner made me a cup of coffee this morning just how I like it."" This specificity makes the feeling of appreciation, a form of love, more tangible.
 
* Perform Acts of Kindness: The quickest way to feel love is often to give it away with no expectation of return. Buy a coffee for the person behind you, send an encouraging text message, or offer a genuine compliment. These actions generate positive neurochemicals like oxytocin, the ""bonding hormone,"" creating a real, physiological sensation of love and connection.
 
* Create a Physical Anchor: Choose a small object, like a smooth stone, a coin, or a piece of jewelry. In a moment when you feel a strong sense of love, hold this object in your hand and focus on the feeling. Over time, your brain will associate the object with the emotion, and you can use it as a physical touchstone to bring you back to that feeling during stressful or disconnected moments.


The Spiritual Perspective: Aligning with a Universal Truth


Spiritual traditions see love not merely as a fleeting emotion but as the fundamental essence of existence‚Äîthe connective tissue of the universe. To remember love is to remember our true nature and our inherent connection to the divine, to others, and to all of life.


Core Principles:
 
* Love as Source: In many faiths, God or Ultimate Reality is synonymous with Love. In Christianity, ""God is love"" (1 John 4:8). In Sufism, the mystical path of Islam, one of God's primary names is Al-Wadud, ""the Loving One."" Remembering love is an act of remembering this source.
 
* The Heart as an Organ of Perception: The spiritual heart is seen as the center of wisdom and connection. The goal of many spiritual practices is to clear away the ""dust"" of ego, fear, and resentment from the ""mirror of the heart"" so it can reflect the divine love that is always present.
 
* Oneness and Interconnection (Interbeing): Spiritual wisdom teaches that we are not separate, isolated beings. In Buddhism, the concept of interbeing reveals that our existence is woven together. To remember love is to recognize this shared identity and act with compassion for all parts of our extended self.
Spiritual Practices to Remember Love:
 
* Loving-Kindness Meditation (Metta): This is a cornerstone practice in Buddhist traditions. You systematically generate feelings of love and goodwill, starting with yourself and then extending outwards to a loved one, a neutral person, a difficult person, and finally to all living beings. The silent repetition of phrases like, ""May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you live with ease,"" is a direct method for cultivating and remembering love as an unconditional force.
 
* Contemplative Prayer and Devotion (Bhakti): This involves directing one's heart's energy toward a divine figure or principle. It can be a silent, heartfelt conversation with God, chanting, or singing devotional songs. This practice shifts the focus from the small, ego-self to a vast, loving presence, allowing one to feel ""filled up"" with a love greater than one's own.
 
* Practice Forgiveness: Holding onto resentment blocks the flow of love. Forgiveness, in a spiritual context, is not about condoning a harmful act but about freeing your own heart from the poison of anger. It is a profound act of self-love that reopens you to connection with others.
 
* See the Divine in Nature: Spend time in the natural world‚Äîa park, a forest, or simply watching the clouds‚Äîand contemplate the intelligence and beauty that surrounds you. Recognizing this intricate, life-sustaining web can evoke a powerful sense of awe and connection, a form of universal love for creation itself.


By integrating these spiritual and secular approaches, remembering love becomes a holistic practice. It is both a skill you can develop through conscious effort and a truth you can align with through heartfelt surrender. It is the practical work of building better habits of mind and the sacred work of opening your heart to the grace that is always available.

1lvomem,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lvomem/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_kettle_zwilling/,Should You Buy the Best Electric Kettle ZWILLING Enfinigy,"Testing out the ZWILLING 53101-500 electric kettle became one of the highlights of my morning routine. Aesthetic yet functional, this appliance delivers a performance that‚Äôs as sleek as its silver, matte-finish design. From the moment it appeared on my countertop, it was clear the kettle was crafted with precision‚Äîthere‚Äôs just a certain beauty in its minimal design and the way it blends German engineering with Italian artistry. However, as with anything, digging a little deeper revealed both its winning points and areas that could use some attention. Let me share my experience with you.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Mesmerizing is a good word to start with when describing the design of this appliance. One look, and you can tell this isn't your ordinary water boiler. The double-walled body does more than add to its robust aesthetic‚Äîit genuinely keeps the exterior cool even after heating water to a boil. Safety is always a priority in the kitchen, so this feature definitely caught my eye. The seamless stainless-steel interior not only feels premium but also ensures no weird aftertastes, making this a kettle that‚Äôs designed for anyone with a refined palate. Measuring 10.3""L x 8.7""W x 12.9""H, it nestles comfortably on your counter without hogging too much space.

**Performance and Convenience**  
The true magic of this kettle lies in how it adapts to various needs. With six pre-set temperature programs, I‚Äôve been able to brew everything from green tea to coffee at the appropriate heat levels. For tea enthusiasts or parents heating baby formula, this is a game-changer! The keep-warm function was another nice touch‚ÄîI left the water hot for a solid 30 minutes while distracted by chores. Plus, the 70¬∞ lid opening is pure genius‚Äîit prevents any worried encounters with escaping steam. Convenience quickly became synonymous with this kettle, and it‚Äôs hard to go back to any standard alternatives.

[Check ZWILLING 53101-500 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b085xlz4pg/)

**Good Points**  
- Double-walled body ensures a cool touch exterior for added safety.  
- Six pre-set temperature options for precision brewing.  
- Keep-warm function holds temperature for up to 30 minutes.  
- Sleek, compact design fits seamlessly in modern kitchens.

**Noise and Speed**  
Having gone through my fair share of poorly designed kettles, I was curious about whether this one produced much noise. I‚Äôm happy to report that it‚Äôs surprisingly quiet, even when bringing cold tap water to a roaring boil. The speed of heating was equally impressive‚Äîit definitely left similar gadgets in the dust. Within minutes, I had the hot water I needed without annoying background clatter.

**Shortcomings**  
Still, a perfect product doesn‚Äôt exist, and this kettle has its quirks. The biggest issue I discovered was the stainless-steel finish on its interior‚Äîit requires regular maintenance to avoid water spots or mineral buildup if you live in a hard-water area. Since it‚Äôs not dishwasher-safe, cleaning it manually felt a bit laborious. Additionally, while premium in design, the hefty weight (nearly five pounds) makes one-handed usage less convenient than I hoped.

- Hand-wash only adds a bit of extra effort.  
- Weight could be cumbersome for individuals with mobility challenges.  

**Competing Products**  
Stacking against other modern kettles, such as Breville‚Äôs well-loved offerings, this one shines in safety and customization. Breville models might come with more preset options, but they lack the thoughtfully cool exterior. Fellow Stagg EKG, a kettle I previously tested, delivers exceptional pour control for coffee aficionados but lags behind in versatility. Between these choices, it stands out for its double-walled insulation and intuitive design for families or multitaskers.

**Affordable Quality**  
Before diving into any purchase, I always consider whether it offers real quality for the price. This electric kettle leans toward the premium side, no doubt. But stacking the features like precision temperature settings, robust build, and innovative heat retention, you do get what you pay for. If sustainability matters, its durable construction promises a long-lasting appliance, which only cements its value over time.

I'm a bit of a lurker, but I'm a bit confused on some diet stuff so I figured it was my turn to post.

For some context, I've been lifting for a few years, my peak was 235lbs @ 10-15% fat (I'm 6' M, mid 20's), but I gave myself overtraining syndrome that impacted my hormones and my doc told me to take a couple months off. I ended up taking about 4 off and struggled for another 2-3 to get back into a routine, and my weight went up to 245.   
  
I have more fat than I'd like, and my doc told me I should probably trim some off for my long term health, so I decided to go into a caloric deficit and get back to the gym.

Right now I'm eating 1800-2800 calories per day - for context my caloric intake at my peak was close to 3500. I know that range is too wide, I'm doing my best to stabilize it closer to 2500-2800, but when I have busy days at work I'll completely lose track of time until after 5pm, and I cannot physically eat all my calories within between afterwork and bed (9:30PM), especially on gym days.   
  
Starting weight was a little above where I was averaging, coming in at 247. End of first month I was at 242, figured that everything was working, and I'd be good. I'm at the beginning of my third month, and I'm back at 246. To be fair, when I measured my waist a couple days ago, I had gone from 43"" to 41"", so it seems like there has been at least some fat loss.  
  
I understand some of that is muscle growth as I've been consistent at the gym for 3x per week with a legs/pull/push split, but I don't believe all of it is muscle. 

I'm sleeping 7.5 hrs/night on average during the week, and on weekends I can sleep as much as 9.5 hrs. I'm drinking bare minimum .5gal/day of water with a goal of 1gal (I'd say I succeed a good 40% of the time), and also drinking a bunch of other fluids (coffee, non-caffeinated teas, protein shakes, etc). My diet prioritizes protein pretty hard, and doesn't eliminate carbs, but I tend to be below 50g in carbs per day.

Is this just a patience thing and I just need to wait for my metabolism to continue catching back up to where it used to be? Do I just need to eat more consistently? Drink more?   
  
I know I'm not perfectly executing, but I'm not sure if my mistake is truly as simple as the ones above or if I'm missing something important. Any ideas?",1,1752081707.0,powerbuilding,2,0.67,False

¬∞ not straying away from gritty details

¬∞ show a realistic behaviour (i dont mind extra drama, lol, but i want the characters to have their essence if it makes sense)

¬∞ explores social dynamics, have a psychological approach to things

¬∞if they're historic i want them somewhat accurate, both in costume and depictions of court behaviours etc

Since then, I‚Äôve had a few situationships and dated casually (mostly through dating apps) but nothing serious. The closest I came was with someone from my hometown. We‚Äôd see each other whenever I was back and talked daily when we were apart (call/text), but we both knew it wouldn‚Äôt go beyond that. We went no contact after she met her current partner, and in hindsight, I wish I‚Äôd spoken to her about what being serious might‚Äôve looked like. This was about a year ago, and it took me a while to move on. Throughout this time, I‚Äôve been pretty noncommittal.

Recently, I decided I want to approach dating more seriously and change some old habits. I met someone online and we texted for about two weeks before meeting up (this is longer than usual for me). We went for coffee, which turned into dinner, and then she stayed over. I‚Äôd told myself I wouldn‚Äôt sleep with someone on the first date anymore, but it felt right at the time. A week later we saw each other again, I made us dinner, and stayed the night.

Since that second date, she‚Äôs started to bring up the ‚Äúwhat are we?‚Äù conversation. She also asked to be exclusive after the first date while we explore what we might be, which I agreed to but it does show how quickly this is moving.

For me, it still feels too early to know what this is or where it‚Äôs going. I‚Äôve been upfront and told herI don‚Äôt know yet. I like spending time with her, but I‚Äôm not sure yet if I see something long term. After two dates, I feel like that‚Äôs normal.

I think our different dating experiences add to this. She‚Äôs mostly dated people she was already close friends with, so there was trust from the start. Sleeping with me on the first date was a first for her, so from her perspective this still feels casual. But for me, it feels quite serious already.

I know I haven‚Äôt always been great with commitment, and I‚Äôm trying to change that because my old patterns haven‚Äôt made me happy. Still, this feels pretty fast for me. I do want to approach dating in a more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and committed way, but I‚Äôm not really sure what that should look like. Is it typical to have this kind of conversation after just two dates?

I don‚Äôt want to pull away from something that could turn out really good, but I also don‚Äôt want to rush into a relationship before I‚Äôve had the chance to really see if we‚Äôre a good fit. How do people usually know when it feels right? If I‚Äôm not sure yet, does that mean it‚Äôs not there or can that just take more time to develop?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice on what you would do in my shoes and about what a healthy timeline for figuring this out might look like

Chapter 1

On our wedding anniversary, my husband insisted on inviting his entire crew of friends to celebrate with us. Among them was a female ""bro"" I'd never seen before.

The moment she walked in, she plopped down directly on my husband's lap and starting a video call: ""Mom, I made it! Your godson is sitting right next to me.""

Then she turned and pressed her face close to his, practically nuzzling him: ""Well, Knox, if you ever treat me badly, I'll have both our families beat you up!""

Crack!

The glass I was holding slipped from my fingers, shattering on the floor.

In an instant, everyone's eyes were on me.

His female ""bro"" just arched one eyebrow:

""Hey, I was just joking around. You're not bothered by that, are you?""

The private room fell silent instantly‚Äîyou could hear a pin drop.

I instinctively looked at Knox.

He just smiled and playfully tapped Piper's head, his tone affectionate: ""Today's my wedding anniversary with my wife. Don't be so wild.""

She pouted flirtatiously, naturally wrapping her arms around his neck: ""Fine. Since you're throwing this welcome-home party for me, I'll give you that much.""

By then, a server came in to clean up the broken glass and handed me a new cup.

Someone took the opportunity to ease the tension: ""Don't mind her, Riley. Piper's always been carefree‚Äîshe doesn't mean any harm.""

I remained silent.

Piper glanced at me dismissively: ""Don't tell me you're actually this petty?""

After that, she released her hold on Knox and hopped off his lap: ""Guess I better keep my distance from you, Knox. So wifey doesn't throw a fit when you get home.""

Then she shook her head with a dramatic sigh, teasing the group of guys: ""Now you see why I don't hang out with women?""

""So damn dramatic and sensitive. It's exhausting.""

Nobody picked up her comment, and the atmosphere turned awkward.

Someone hesitantly spoke up: ""Piper, it's their anniversary today, maybe tone it down a bit...""

Suddenly Piper covered her mouth in mock realization: ""Oh my god, I almost forgot! I brought a gift!""

Then she pulled out a velvet jewelry box from her purse and presented it to Knox like a prized treasure: ""Ta-da!""

When she opened the box, inside lay a pair of gleaming gemstone cufflinks‚Äîmen's cufflinks.

Someone politely gasped in admiration.

Knox smiled. ""You came all the way back home‚ÄîI should be the one giving you gifts.""

Hearing this, Piper gave him a coy look and reached over to fasten them on his wrists.

As she moved, matching cufflinks on her own sleeves caught the light brilliantly.

""Hmph, I picked these out especially for you. You better appreciate them.""

Some people had already begun secretly glancing at my expression, but I just took a deep breath, my clenched fingers leaving crescent-shaped marks on my palm.

Then I stood up.

Knox frowned. ""Where are you going?""

I forced a smile. ""To book you two a hotel room.""

""Otherwise I'm afraid you'll do it right here.""

The moment I finished speaking, Piper violently smashed the empty jewelry box in her hand onto the floor.

She cursed loudly: ""What's fucking wrong with this chick?""

""I told you guys we should've just hung out with the bros.""

""Now she's completely ruined the mood!""

Knox chased after me, his tone urgent: ""Babe, Piper doesn't mean anything by it.""

""They're just cufflinks. She's always been casual like this‚Äîdon't take it personally.""

""And what you said back there was way out of line...""

I gave him a cold smile. ""So the real reason you invited all your friends today was to celebrate your childhood sweetheart coming home, right?""

Knox shifted uncomfortably, avoiding my eyes. ""Why are you making such a big deal out of this?""

""Besides, our anniversaries are always just the two of us‚Äîthat gets a bit dull.""

""I thought inviting more people would make it more fun.""

Seeing my expression darken, Knox grabbed my hand, his tone softening unusually: ""Babe, don't overthink this. Piper and I have known each other for years‚Äîif something was going to happen between us, it would have already.""

""And look, I chose to be with you, didn't I?""

I nearly laughed from anger: ""I'm so sorry for taking your childhood sweetheart's place.""

""Fine, I'll step aside.""

Knox's face flushed red as he yanked his hand away, his tone hardening: ""What are you talking about? You know that's not what I meant.""

""Riley, you're being completely unreasonable!""

With that, he stormed off without looking back.

But his footsteps gradually slowed. I knew he was waiting for me to compromise and follow him, just like I always had before.

I frowned, turned around and walked away.

This man is truly disgusting!

Chapter 2

Knox came home at three in the morning.

He was completely wasted, clothes disheveled, reeking of alcohol, stumbling as he tried to embrace me.

I frowned and dodged him, but he caught my wrist.

Next second, his boozy breath hit my face: ""Happy anniversary, babe. Look what I got you.""

He pulled a jewelry box from his pocket and opened it in front of me‚Äîit was the Graff Diamonds jewelry set I'd been eyeing for months.

But my eyes quickly fell on the two empty spots in the box.

Knox scratched his head sheepishly: ""Piper accidentally saw it, and she really liked the bracelet and ring. She insisted on taking them.""

""I figured you already have plenty of bracelets and rings, so I let her have them...""

When I didn't take it, he tried to force the box into my hands, his tone reassuring: ""Babe, don't be mad. If you really want them, I'll buy you another set, okay?""

Yet I just stepped back, letting the jewelry box clatter to the floor.

Knox paused, pressed his lips together to control his temper, then forced a smile: ""Babe, I was wrong today. I'm sorry.""

""I shouldn't have invited so many people on our anniversary. But look what I got!""

With that, he pulled out a small cherry cake from behind his back.

I stared at the cake, memories flooding back...

The day we got together, he had given me a cherry cake too.

Since then, we'd promised to celebrate every important occasion with cherry cake.

In that moment, fragments of everything we'd experienced together over the years flashed before my eyes.

I sighed and finally accepted it.

Fine. I'll forgive him one last time.

Seeing me unwrap the cake, Knox's face lit up with a huge smile.

As he fed me a bite, he cautiously began: ""Babe, Piper just got back and hasn't found an apartment yet...""

""She wants to stay with us for a few days. Is that okay?""

""She promised she won't cause you any trouble!""

The sickly sweet taste in my mouth suddenly made me nauseous.

I rushed to the bathroom and couldn't help throwing up.

Knox followed anxiously, patting my back: ""What's wrong? Babe.""

I forcibly pushed his hand away, went to the table and smashed everything on it.

I looked at him, my eyes red: ""Yes, she can stay!

""I'll go!""

Knox's expression instantly changed, his voice rising: ""What are you making a scene about now? I told you it's temporary! You're walking out over something this trivial?""

His contorted face reflected in my eyes, but this time, the light in my eyes had completely extinguished.

I shook my head and forced a bleak smile: ""Let's get divorced.""

Knox clearly hadn't expected me to say that.

He exploded with rage, violently kicking over the coffee table:

""Riley, are you fucking mental? You're really pushing it!""

Chapter 3

I locked myself in the master bedroom.

When Knox finished his shower and found the door wouldn't open, he pounded on it furiously before slinking off to the guest room.

The next morning, he sat at the breakfast table with a cold expression. The table was set with an elaborate breakfast.

I snickered.

Playing the silent treatment card? How pathetic.

I just gave him a cold glance and walked expressionlessly toward the front door.

Knox couldn't take it anymore: ""Riley, don't be so goddamn ungrateful!""

""You were wrong yesterday too. You shouldn't throw around divorce as an empty threat.""

Without looking back, I replied flatly: ""I'm serious. Start preparing for it.""

After I closed the door, I heard dishes shattering inside.

...

By the time I reached the office, my emotions had completely settled.

My work efficiency remained as high as ever. Almost no one could tell I was having relationship troubles.

During a meeting, my boss announced: ""We have an international order that requires someone to travel to British for a month.""

""If anyone's interested, contact me. The company will cover all expenses, plus a travel allowance.""

At that moment, messages from Knox popped up one after another on my phone screen. I irritably turned off the phone and said loudly: ""I can go.""

After the meeting, a close colleague stopped me, sounding puzzled: ""Riley, what about your husband while you're gone for a month?""

I replied nonchalantly: ""Oh, he has his childhood sweetheart to keep him company. He won't be lonely.""

Hearing my words, my colleague realized they'd said something wrong and awkwardly shut up.

When I got home that evening, I found an unfamiliar suitcase in the entryway.

Bright pink, covered with random stickers.

I took off my heels only to discover someone had taken my house slippers.

My expression darkened immediately.

Walking barefoot a few steps forward, I heard flirtatious laughter: ""Wow, Knox! Your cooking has really improved since I last saw you!""

Piper was wearing my cherry slippers, eating with oil dripping down her chin.

In her hands were clearly my plate and fork.

Seeing me approach, Piper seemed startled: ""Oh! shit, how do you walk so silently? You could've said something‚Äîyou just scared me!""

""Knox, you're even more jumpy than I am. Must be rough getting scared by your wife every day, huh?""

Without wasting a single word, I stepped forward and slapped her across the face twice, hard and loud.

Then I threw the dishes on the table to the floor.

Piper was stunned by the slaps at first, then immediately exploded: ""You fucking bitch! You dare hit me?!""

Knox heard the commotion and rushed out from the kitchen, grabbing the raging Piper.

She twisted in his arms: ""Knox, did you see that? Has your wife lost her mind? She hit me the second she walked in!""

""How can you stand this psycho? Why are you holding me back? Hit her back for me!""

Knox's face darkened as he yelled at me: ""Riley, what the hell is wrong with you? Apologize right now!""

I curled my lips into a smile: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. I couldn't see clearly.""

""I just saw some woman wearing my slippers, using my dishes‚ÄîI thought she was a thief.""

Piper's face flushed red, looking somewhat guilty: ""I didn't know they were yours...""

But she was obviously lying.

I love cherries‚Äîalmost everything of mine at home has a cherry symbol on it. If she accidentally wore my slippers, that would be understandable, but to also use my plates, my forks? Too many coincidences? Only a fool would believe she wasn't doing it deliberately.

Seeing that I'd apologized, her expression changed.

She nestled softly in Knox's arms, showing her reddened cheek and tearful eyes: ""I'm sorry, Riley. Even if it was an accident, I shouldn't have touched your things...""

I raised an eyebrow.

Well, well. A professional damsel in distress.

But Knox was clearly falling for it.

He soothingly patted Piper's shoulder, then frowned at me: ""Riley, you've really gone too far this time.""

Then he helped Piper to the guest room to treat her face.",1,1752080941.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Las Vegas Is Really Feeling the Heat: What Happens When the Magic Melts (Please share, we‚Äôd love to hear your voice)

>**When Magic Was Real** 

>There was a time when Las Vegas felt like a secret shared between strangers. You'd walk into any casino and the cocktail waitress would remember your drink from three nights ago. The buffet man would slip you an extra dinner roll with a wink. The dealers knew your name, your hometown, your lucky numbers. It wasn't just hospitality; it was something warmer, more human. Vegas wrapped you in velvet ropes and made you feel like the most important person in the world, even if you'd only brought fifty dollars and a dream. That Vegas believed in magic. Real magic. The kind that made a school teacher from Ohio feel like Sinatra for a weekend. Where slot machines sang their mechanical lullabies and every spin held the promise of transformation. Where the neon didn't just light up the desert; it lit up possibilities.

>**The Slow Goodbye**

>I remember the exact moment I realized Vegas was saying goodbye to itself. It was 2009, standing at the Forum Shops watching tourists pose for Instagram photos in front of the fake Roman statues. The magic wasn't in the statues anymore; it was in the angles for the perfect selfie. The wonder had become a backdrop.

>The old Vegas didn't need to explain itself. It was pure theater, unapologetic in its excess and generous with its dreams. Every corner promised an adventure. Every dealer's smile suggested you were in on something special. The city hummed with an energy that said, ""Anything can happen here. Anything."" But then the accountants arrived.

>**When Wonder Became Inventory**

>Somewhere along the way, Vegas stopped believing in its own magic and started believing in spreadsheets. The slot machines that once paid the electric bills became square footage to be maximized. The showrooms that once hosted legends became rental properties. The restaurants that once served comfort food at comfort prices became celebrity chef real estate ventures.

>I watched it happen slowly, then all at once. The Forum Shops at Caesars turned the casino into a mall. The Venetian built canals that felt more like theme park rides than romantic escapes. CityCenter rose like a monument to everything Vegas used to mock cold, calculated, corporate. They called it evolution. I called it heartbreak.

>**The Death of Generosity**

>Vegas used to give before it took. Free drinks while you played. Free shows to keep you happy. Free parking because you were a guest, not a transaction. The city's generosity wasn't just marketing; it was philosophy. Vegas believed that if you treated people like royalty, they'd feel royal enough to take royal risks.

>Then came the fees. Resort fees that appeared like fine print lies. Parking fees that made you pay for the privilege of giving them your money. The free pirate show at Treasure Island sailed away forever, leaving behind a decorative ship and a metaphor too painful to ignore. Each fee was a small betrayal, a crack in the promise that Vegas was a place where ordinary people could feel extraordinary. The city that once made millionaires out of dishwashers now made dishwashers out of millionaires.

>**The Hollow Crown**

>The worst part isn‚Äôt that Vegas changed. Cities change. The worst part is how Vegas changed while pretending to still be itself. The neon still glows, but it illuminates different dreams now. Rich dreams. Exclusive dreams. Dreams that cost three hundred dollars for dinner and thiry dollars just to park. Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs restaurants replaced the places where locals ate. Nobu replaced the corner diners where stories were shared over coffee and pie. The buffets that once fed families for twenty dollars now cost eighty and require reservations. Vegas didn‚Äôt just raise its prices it raised its expectations of who deserved to be there. The new Vegas visitors arrive with platinum cards and leave with Instagram memories. They experience the city through restaurant reservations and VIP packages. They‚Äôre tourists in the truest sense they observe Vegas without ever really entering it.

>**When the Lights Went Out** 

>COVID gave Vegas the excuse it had been looking for. When the city reopened, it reopened smaller, colder, more efficient. Fewer workers meant fewer familiar faces. More automation meant fewer human moments. The virus didn‚Äôt just close casinos; it closed the last chapter of a Vegas that believed in people over profits.

>The bean counters emerged from the shutdown with clipboards and calculators, trimming every expense that didn‚Äôt directly correlate to revenue. They didn‚Äôt just cut costs‚Äîthey cut the soul. The magic that couldn‚Äôt be measured became the magic that couldn‚Äôt be justified.

>**The Sports Mirage**

>Now Vegas sells itself as a sports city. The Golden Knights, the Raiders, the endless parade of visiting teams and traveling fans. It‚Äôs smart business, bringing in crowds that spend fast and leave faster. But sports fans aren‚Äôt Vegas fans. They come for the game, not the dream. They want efficiency, not mystery. The new Vegas gives them exactly what they want quick transactions, predictable experiences, Instagram moments. But it‚Äôs given up what made Vegas irreplaceable: the sense that anything could happen, that you could be anyone, that the city itself was rooting for you to win.

>**The Restaurant That Forgot Its Recipe**

>I think about Vegas like a restaurant I used to love. For decades, you could count on it. The food wasn‚Äôt just good; it was exactly what you needed. The atmosphere felt like home, if home were a little more magical and a lot more generous. Then new management took over. They kept the name, kept the location, even kept a few of the old dishes. But everything else changed. The prices doubled. The portions shrank. The waitstaff smiled but didn‚Äôt remember your order. The warmth became professional courtesy. You still go sometimes, hoping to recapture what you once felt. But you leave disappointed not just because it‚Äôs different, but because it‚Äôs forgotten what made it special in the first place.

>**What We Lost**

>We lost the Vegas that believed in second chances and long shots. We lost the Vegas that treated a grocery store clerk like a high roller if they played with heart. We lost the Vegas that understood that magic isn‚Äôt about how much you spend it‚Äôs about how much you believe. The old Vegas was built on a beautiful lie: that everyone deserves to feel special, that everyone deserves a chance to win, that everyone deserves to be treated like they matter. It was a lie worth believing because it made it true, if only for a weekend.

>The new Vegas tells a different story. It‚Äôs honest about its priorities profit margins, efficiency ratings, demographic targeting. It‚Äôs successful in ways the old Vegas never was. But success and magic aren‚Äôt the same thing.

>**The Gamble We Lost**

>Vegas is still magnificent in its way. The architecture still astounds. The energy still pulses. The lights still pierce the desert darkness. But it‚Äôs the magnificence of a museum now, not a living dream.

>The real gamble isn‚Äôt at the tables anymore. It‚Äôs whether Vegas can remember what it was while becoming what it thinks it needs to be. Whether it can serve both the tourists with platinum cards and the dreamers with twenty-dollar bills. Whether it can be profitable without forgetting to be magical. I still love Vegas. I always will. But I love it the way you love someone who‚Äôs forgotten how to love you back. The lights are still on, but the warmth has gone out of them. The show still goes on, but the heart has left the building.

>And sometimes, late at night when the crowds thin and the neon reflects off empty streets, I swear I can still hear the ghost of the old Vegas whispering

>Remember when anything was possible here

>Remember when everyone was welcome

>Remember when we believed in magic

>I remember. I just wish Vegas did too.

At first, I thought he was just holding his phone in a weird way, but then i noticed a faint reflection in the window behind him that he was indeed recording me.

Medyo malabo mata ko plus wala ako glasses so i didnt assume anything yet, but i still felt uneasy. The crazy part is when i went to take a piss, may bagong coffee na sa table ko pero the guy recording me was gone na.

The man was pretty tall, fair complexion, maybe in his mid 30s, and had a full arm tatoo (I didn't really pay attention to him, this is the only description I remember). I asked the barista if she could remember who ordered this drink (brought it to the counter) and asked why. Sabi ko 'naiwain kasi ata sa table ko, parang di pa nagagalaw'. The cashier answered and that he didnt catch his face, but yung matangkad daw.

Ako naman, siyempre di ko ininom. Iniwan ko lang sa table next to me. Pero as I studied a few more minutes, late saakin nag sink in na baka he bought me coffee...? Especially that I did catch him recording me.

Suddenly I entered all sherlock homes and sht so I didn't drink it talaga kasi feel ko may druqz yun tapos baka pag nahilo ako sa labas kidnapin ako.

Regular na ako at that particular Tims branch and lowkey takot na ako bumalik doon. Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty buff and could fend for myself, pero sobrang nag chills ako ngayon haha kakauwi ko pa lang (1:00am). Nag book na lang ako grab kaba.

1lvo6a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarriottBONVoY/comments/1lvo6a7/san_jose_m_club_a_joke/,San Jose M club a joke!,"Is it just me, or is the M Club Lounge at the San Jose Marriott a joke?

I travel a lot for work. I‚Äôm a Marriott Platinum & normally I don‚Äôt get too precious about lounge expectations‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not asking for white tablecloths or an omelet station although I‚Äôd love those tbh. But my recent experience at the San Jose Marriott genuinely left me wondering why they even bother.

Here‚Äôs what I got for my ‚Äúelite‚Äù loyalty:
	‚Ä¢	A sad bowl of oatmeal with barely anything for toppings. No nuts. No fruit. No yogurt. No hot options beyond the watery oats. It felt like breakfast in a break room, not a perk.
	‚Ä¢	Coffee served in cheap paper to-go cups. In the lounge. No mugs. No ceramic anything. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd at least offer a proper vessel for the one thing everyone in there clearly needed.
	‚Ä¢	Lighting and ambiance straight out of a conference room from 1998. It was completely soulless.
	‚Ä¢	No sense that this was meant to feel like anything more than a box checked off on a spreadsheet called ‚Äúelite offerings.‚Äù

Look, I get that not every property is a flagship, and not every lounge is going to impress. But if you‚Äôre going to advertise the M Club as a premium experience for your loyal guests, you have to do something to back that up. Right now, it feels like Marriott is phoning it in and we‚Äôre the ones paying for the long-distance call.

This isn‚Äôt about being entitled. It‚Äôs about being tired of putting in hundreds of nights and thousands of dollars only to be handed a paper cup and a spoonful of disappointment.

Anyway. Rant over. Off to find real coffee and a breakfast that doesn‚Äôt make me question my life choices.

Would love to hear if others have had a better experience at this property or if this is just the sad new normal.",1,1752080687.0,MarriottBONVoY,0,0.67,False

We are unsure with: We want to replace the wardrobe but I am very unsure about the design. I like the idea of a smaller wardrobe and a chest of drawers with a mirror on the wall but fear that the space isnt large enough and look cluttered. Alternative would be similar sized wardrobe hugging the corner and a slim chest drawers where I could put my printer on top. Neither seems 100% right so I would like some input on this (layout, design)

Importantly, we need enough space to fit our clothes and the chest of drawers would be nice to store office equipment/documents/notebooks. I would also like the space to look big and bright. 

If the printer doesn't go there, I would like some advice on where it could go without looking out of place.

1lvo30t,https://i.redd.it/xetem5hsqvbf1.jpeg,Stolen Bike Fremont,"Hey all,

My hopes are low, but my bike was stolen this morning in Fremont. Specifically at about 6:30am in front of Fremont Coffee Company. I made the bad decision, after realizing I didn't have my lock key, that leaving my bike unlocked for 30mins would be okay. 

I've already filed a police report and made posts on Project 529 and Bike Index. Figured it wouldn't hurt to post here as well. 

Any advice on recovery is welcome.

Let‚Äôs face it, we‚Äôre living in a wild time for creators, aren‚Äôt we? It‚Äôs like the digital equivalent of the gold rush out there, but instead of pickaxes, we‚Äôve got AI tools at our disposal. And if you‚Äôre just starting to dip your toes into the creator world, we need to talk about how to *stop wasting time* and work smarter, not harder. Are you in? Let‚Äôs go! üöÄ

**Why should you care?** Well, what‚Äôs worse than spending hours creating content only to find out it could‚Äôve been done in half the time? I feel you. I‚Äôve been there too, and trust me‚Äîthose late nights and endless scrolling aren‚Äôt doing you any favors. 

Here‚Äôs a little rundown on what you can do to leverage AI tools and kickstart your creative journey without feeling like you‚Äôve just run a marathon. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

### **1. Pick Your AI Partner Wisely**

So many tools, so little time! Here‚Äôs a quick list of AI helpers that can be game changers:

- **Content Generators** (like ChatGPT): Perfect for generating blog ideas or even drafting full articles.
- **Photo/Video Editing AI** (like Canva): Say goodbye to complex software. A few clicks and you‚Äôre golden!
- **SEO Tools** (like Jasper): They‚Äôll help sprinkle some magical keywords throughout your content without breaking a sweat. 

### **2. Automate Your Routine**

Why do the tedious tasks yourself when AI has got your back? Set it up to do this:

- **Social Media Scheduling:** Tools like Buffer or Hootsuite can post on your behalf while you binge-watch your favorite show. (Not that I‚Äôm judging‚Ä¶ Netflix is life.)
- **Data Analysis:** Got numbers to crunch? Let AI generate reports for you while you sip on that victory coffee. ‚òïÔ∏è

### **3. Don‚Äôt Forget the Human Touch!**

Remember, AI can do a lot, but what it can‚Äôt do is replicate your unique voice. Here are some ways to keep it real:

- **Add Personal Stories:** Your audience wants to connect with *you*, not just stats and facts. 
- **Engage and Respond:** Use these tools to ease your workload, not as a shield from your audience. So go ahead, interact with the comments section!

### **4. Keep Learning and Experimenting!**

The beauty of AI is that it‚Äôs always evolving, just like us. Dabble with new tools, check out what others are doing, and don‚Äôt be afraid to tweak your approach. 

- **Commit to Continuous Learning:** Join webinars or online courses (we've got some pretty cool offerings in AiContentAutomators if you haven‚Äôt checked them out! üòâ).
- **Share What Works!** Nothing feels better than contributing to an ocean of knowledge. 

So, what do you think? Are you super pumped to take on this AI-powered journey, or still feeling a bit hesitant? Whether you‚Äôre ready to dive in or just dipping your toes, there‚Äôs room for all of us in this wild ride. Keep *that creativity flowing*, and let‚Äôs make some amazing stuff happen before the gold rush settles. üí∞‚ú®

You're hustling hard, but not seeing the needle move as much as you'd like? I get it. Scaling a business, especially when you're bootstrapped, can feel like climbing a mountain with sandals. But what if I told you some of the most powerful tools for business growth are already at your fingertips... and they're FREE? Let's unlock that potential!

**The Challenge:**

Let's face it: getting your business noticed in today's crowded marketplace is tough. You're competing against established giants with massive marketing budgets. You're also navigating a constantly evolving digital landscape where algorithms change overnight. Many small businesses struggle because they rely on outdated methods, neglect online presence, or simply don't know where to start with digital marketing. They're essentially leaving money on the table, missing out on potential customers, and hindering their overall growth. And let‚Äôs be honest, that‚Äôs frustrating!

**Unleash Your Growth Potential with Google's Hidden Gems**

Ready to transform your business without breaking the bank? These five free Google tools can make a HUGE difference if you know how to use them:

*   **Google Business Profile (GBP): Your FREE Digital Storefront**

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Claim and optimize your Google Business Profile. This is your online listing in Google Search and Maps. Fill out EVERY section completely: business name, address, phone number, website, business hours, services, photos, and a detailed description. Regularly update your GBP with new posts, promotions, and answer customer questions promptly.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Imagine someone searches ""best pizza near me."" If your GBP is optimized and has positive reviews, you'll rank higher, attracting potential customers. Or, let's say a customer is looking for a ""plumber open 24 hours."" An accurate and updated GBP with that information ensures they find YOU, not your competitor.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't neglect reviews! Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews on your GBP. Respond to ALL reviews, both positive and negative. Ignoring negative reviews makes you look unresponsive and can damage your reputation. A common pitfall is inconsistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone number) information across the web. Ensure it's the same everywhere.

*   **Google Analytics: Understand Your Website's Soul**

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Set up Google Analytics on your website. Start tracking key metrics: website traffic, bounce rate, session duration, conversion rates, and popular pages. Analyze your data to understand how users interact with your site. Identify areas for improvement, such as underperforming pages or high bounce rates.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Let's say your homepage has a high bounce rate. This suggests visitors are leaving quickly. Using Analytics, you can pinpoint the problem - is the content unclear? Is the design outdated? Are your calls to action weak? Identify the leak and fix it!
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't be overwhelmed by the data. Focus on the key metrics that are most relevant to your business goals. Set up goals in Analytics to track conversions, such as form submissions or purchases. A common pitfall is not excluding internal traffic (your own visits) from your data, skewing the results.

*   **Google Search Console: The Voice of Google for Your Website**

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Verify your website with Google Search Console. This tool provides valuable insights into how Google crawls and indexes your site. Identify any errors or technical issues that are preventing your site from ranking higher. Submit your sitemap to help Google discover your pages.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Search Console can reveal if Google is having trouble crawling your website due to broken links or slow loading times. Fixing these issues can dramatically improve your search engine ranking.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Regularly monitor Search Console for errors and warnings. Use the ""URL Inspection"" tool to check if individual pages are indexed and to troubleshoot any issues. A common pitfall is ignoring the ""Mobile Usability"" report, which can highlight problems with your site's responsiveness on mobile devices.

*   **Google Keyword Planner: Unlock the Secrets of Search**

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Use Google Keyword Planner to research relevant keywords for your business. Discover what terms your target audience is searching for online. Analyze keyword search volume, competition, and suggested bid prices (even if you're not running ads). Use these keywords to optimize your website content, blog posts, and Google Business Profile.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** If you sell organic coffee, Keyword Planner can help you find related keywords like ""fair trade coffee beans,"" ""best organic coffee online,"" or ""sustainable coffee roasters."" Target these keywords in your content to attract customers actively searching for these products.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't just focus on high-volume keywords. Target long-tail keywords (longer, more specific phrases) that are less competitive and more likely to convert. A common pitfall is relying solely on Keyword Planner data; supplement it with other keyword research tools and your own intuition.

*   **Google Alerts: Stay Ahead of the Curve**

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:** Set up Google Alerts for your brand name, competitor names, industry keywords, and relevant topics. Receive email notifications whenever these terms are mentioned online. This allows you to monitor your online reputation, track competitor activities, and stay informed about industry trends.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Monitoring your brand name allows you to quickly address negative reviews or mentions. Tracking competitor names helps you stay informed about their marketing campaigns and product launches. Monitoring industry keywords keeps you up-to-date on the latest trends and opportunities.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Fine-tune your alerts to receive the most relevant information. Use specific keywords and filters to avoid getting bombarded with irrelevant notifications. A common pitfall is not taking action on the information you receive from Google Alerts. Respond to negative mentions, capitalize on industry trends, and adapt your strategies accordingly.

I live between M√ºnchen and Starnberg and would love to meet someone nearby who‚Äôs ready for something real. Life feels more meaningful when it's shared with the right person. And, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping to find.

I‚Äôm tall (187 cm), with dark hair and blue eyes. I‚Äôve got a strong build with a bit of softness in the middle. I‚Äôm also on the hairier side, just being honest right from the start. :)

I enjoy the simple things: quiet walks in nature, slow mornings, good food, and spending time with people who make me feel at ease. I speak English, German, and Turkish. I‚Äôm into anime, manga, and board games. So yes, you could say that I‚Äôm a bit nerdy.

What matters most to me is connection, both emotional and physical. I usually feel that spark more with women who are naturally slim, fit, or have an average build. That‚Äôs just me being honest about what I‚Äôm drawn to, not trying to be selective.

There‚Äôs one thing I want to be upfront about: I‚Äôd love to have a child of my own one day. I know that‚Äôs a big thing to share early, but I think it‚Äôs important to speak from the heart.

I‚Äôm not looking for endless texting or something long-distance. I‚Äôd much rather meet in person, have a coffee or tea, take a walk, and see how we vibe.

There‚Äôs a photo on my profile if you'd like to put a face to the words. And if something here speaks to you, I‚Äôd genuinely love to hear from you. :)",1,1752080238.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

A bit of a unique question‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôve been struggling with binge eating episodes recently where in the span of 10-15 minutes I will eat ~1000 calories, but don‚Äôt eat the rest of the day (do consume slight liquid calories (low fat milk in coffee etc). 

I‚Äôve been trying to lose weight (~10 lbs down, 10llbs to go) so anytime I have one of these binges I tend to go crazy at the gym‚Ä¶ 

I track my calories burned on my Fitbit and average ~2800 on these days I really push myself at the gym. 

I guess my question is, although I know it‚Äôs not the healthiest and long term will damage my metabolism, is it possible to lose my last ten pounds if I am countering my poor eating with excessive exercise and still ending up in a deficit? 

The scale has been fluctuating (I hope) due to water retention the last few days.

i started taking sertraline 50mg nearly four years ago for depression & anxiety when i was 18. i had tried other therapies and was just really struggling with handling my mental health. taking sertraline gave me the ability to get a better grip on my life and i‚Äôm in a much better place because of it. my last dosage was 100mg (increased to this after a year or so) and im planning on tapering off slowly now.

the reason i‚Äôve decided to do this is that for a long time i felt very aware that i was emotionally stable BECAUSE of my meds, whereas in the past year or two ive realised ive become actually stable within myself, with the meds having given me the ability to get to that place. so for me, the added tiredness (especially as someone with cfs), low libido, and just having to take a pill every day aren‚Äôt worth it anymore.

my plan currently is to go down in 25mg increments, for about a month at a time. i‚Äôm definitely going to be keeping a close eye on everything and will increase or decrease this speed if i need to. i‚Äôm on day 2 of 75mg now.

i know the typical advice is just to look after yourself and take it slow, but does anyone have any more specific or ‚Äòweird‚Äô advice? like did anyone drink an extra coffee a day or eat less/more sugar etc. etc.? any helpful hobbies or ways to do things? i just want my symptoms to be as manageable as possible. so far im feeling tired and slightly nauseous. thank you!",1,1752080056.0,zoloft,1,1.0,False

It's supposed to be limited to ages 3 and under and is not supervised by any of the church/coffee shop staff. It's in a separate room, but there is a coffee shop seating area with a couple of sofas from which you can see¬†*most*¬†of the soft play.

Multiple times per week, between 1 and 3 local childminders bring their charges to the soft play, leave them there and sit nearby chatting/eating lunch. If it's free, they'll sit at the nearby seating area, but otherwise they will sit round the corner with no sight of the soft play.

They will come and check on the children if they're audibly crying, but otherwise as far as I can tell they just leave them to it. Most of the parents who use the area hang out with their kids in the soft play - myself included. Today that meant a small girl repeatedly coming up to me and asking for help with a toy - I just kept saying ""I'm sorry, I don't know"" and she managed to fix it before I could redirect her to the person who was looking after her. Because they're all older and bigger they can be unintentionally rough and block the babies from using some of the equipment, and I don't feel like it's either my place or responsibility to be asking them to share.

It makes me super uncomfortable that these children are basically being ""looked after"" by strangers in the soft play area while their responsible adult may not even habe sight of them, but they are much older than my little boy. I've not said anything to the childminders at any point, but did stare daggers at them as I left today because I was so fed up!

This has become my go-to breakfast burrito bowl (minus the tortilla). It takes about 15 minutes, doesn‚Äôt require anything fancy, and tastes awesome every time. Figured I‚Äôd share in case anyone else needs a quick, no-fuss keto breakfast!

**Ingredients (makes 2 servings):**

* 4 large eggs
* 1 tbsp heavy cream
* 2 strips of thick-cut bacon
* 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
* 1/2 avocado, diced
* 2 tbsp salsa (make sure it's no-sugar-added, I use one with 1g net carbs per tbsp)
* 1 tbsp sour cream
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Optional: chopped green onions or jalape√±os for a kick

**How I make it:**

1. Cook the bacon first until crispy. I just throw it in the pan while I‚Äôm doing everything else. Once it‚Äôs done, set it aside and chop it up.
2. In the same pan, scramble the eggs with the heavy cream, salt, and pepper (bacon grease = bonus flavour).
3. When the eggs are just about done, mix in the shredded cheddar so it gets all melty and gooey.
4. Divide the eggs into two bowls and top with the chopped bacon, avocado, salsa, and sour cream. Add green onions or jalape√±os if you‚Äôre feeling fancy.
5. Eat immediately and enjoy the warm, cheesy, bacon-y goodness.

I remember a diary entry from when I was probably 16 talking about how I couldn't go to the bathroom and I've recently been treated for anxiety, with some thinking that my brain and gut could be working together to do me dirty for the last 20 years.

I've been diagnosed with SIBO and got treated with rifax / neo which help immensely for the time I was taking it but then it slowly went back to normal where I was having a bowel movement maybe two or three times a week. 

I tried taking magnesium citrate by the bottle, laxatives, etc. Recently I went to a gastro and they finally prescribed me with medication to try and treat the process even though my concerns were that I didn't feel like I had to go to the bathroom ever but they wanted to start treating me for  general constipation.

I got prescribed amitiza which made me feel super anxious and gave me super intrusive thoughts and nausea. So then I switched to Trulance and it also came with zero results.

For the past week I've been taking 1200 mg of magnesium citrate in tablets, 800 mg of psyllium husk, half a glass of kefir, and for breakfast even if I'm not super hungry but I have found that my hunger is coming back for the first time in a long time, I prepare a week's worth of 1 to 2 proportions of overnight oats with cinnamon a little oat milk/water and agave syrup. 

At first it felt like nothing was happening and I was like why am I eating this I'm not hungry and I was initially feeling a little bloated after I would do all these things because I was also trying to increase my water to an absurd amount.

But for the first time in months I have been going to the bathroom every single day and like a good solid BM.

I also do drink coffee so I usually have about 6 oz of that but it's like clockwork. 

I had done this months ago leading up to a vacation and it also worked then but for whatever stupid reason I stopped doing it because I was even having but all movements on my trip which is like completely unheard of to the point where like I had to take like double the dose of laxatives to get going in the most artificial way.

1lvnhr4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvnhr4,"Quintonil** - Mexico City, November 2024","I woke up to a text from my friend the morning of our reservation: 

‚ÄúI am so sick. That lobster fucked me up.‚Äù

We had gone to Em the night before, and had been looking forward to lunch at Quintonil today.

With this text, Em sinks firmly to the bottom of my list of restaurants in CDMX, somewhere below the corner stand with hot al pastor and cold Corona. That lobster dish was raw as hell. I can remember burying it in a pile of rapidly dissolving foam, trying to hide the fact that I had no intention of eating translucent crustacean. I had pointed it out to my friend, but she dutifully finished the dish out of what I assumed was an ingrained adherence to manners, which I half-admired at the time, but now felt differently about.

I should have made a bigger deal about it. The cost-benefit analysis of complaining about the doneness of a dish amongst well-heeled capitalinos and a friend I had no wish to embarrass didn't merit it. At the time.

Anyway, I was going to Quintonil solo. I had paid the deposit, I was only in town for a week, I might as well give it a shot. I hoped they would not hold it against me when I showed up alone. I charged my phone and prayed not to be served raw lobster in a ceramic bucket of bland foam. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The lunch starts with a glass of cava, and a linen napkin embroidered with insects. I still can‚Äôt keep up with an entire maridaje, but I order a glass of rose - embarrassingly basic. 

There‚Äôs a choice presented to me - an autumnal menu, or the classic. There‚Äôs little choice, really. It‚Äôs the week of Thanksgiving, and I can‚Äôt say no to a menu that promises corn, soups, a line up of squash, pumpkin and seeds.

The first dish is a warm ceramic bowl filled with a foamed broth made from maiz and serrano peppers. As a sort of adult show-and-tell, the waiter brings over a bowl of fresh vegetables which make up the broth - including huitlacoche, made from the fungus of the corn. The word he uses for it is the same as that for mushroom, hongo. Fungus, mushroom, I suppose it‚Äôs all the same. The broth was warm and comforting. Lightly spicy. 

The man to the left of me has chosen the wine pairing. I‚Äôm trying not to stare, but he is well into his meal and has a line of half empty wine glasses like a row of soldiers standing before him. He is clearly struggling. He eventually asks that they be removed. 

Quintonil is busy, even at lunchtime on a Tuesday. It wasn‚Äôt an easy reservation to get. Most of the clientele I can hear seem to speak American accented English. New York, maybe.

The second dish is a large ceramic bowl with thinly sliced rounds of pumpkin folded into tiny caps hiding tomatoes and foam, seasoned pepitas. The server calls it a salad, and pours warm butter over top as a dressing, infused with the flavor of rice. The flavor is deep, rich, and I could have had an entire bowl of just this salad and the corn soup that preceded it. I regret nothing.

Between courses, I am handed a cookbook to flip through. I must appear lonely. I enjoy the food when it is brought and type away on my phone when it is taken away. I sip my wine and make small talk with the waiters. Still, this must be what they do for single diners. The cookbook is interesting, if a poor conversationalist. 

The waiter brings over a lovely dish of diced tuna and watermelon surrounded with slices of radish. I can‚Äôt see the kitchen from where I am seated but I imagine a team of chefs placing tiny local flowers onto the round of tuna and sand√≠a with tiny tweezers. As he pours a carafe of aguachile sauce over the tiny sculpture, I remark that it‚Äôs beautiful. He says if it looks beautiful it tastes even better. He is not wrong. When he takes my plate away he asks how it was. We talk about the smoothness of the aguachiles and he tells me my Spanish is good. I think of my poor professor working the knife's-edge of her (and my) sanity to cram an entire language into my skull inside of six months and wonder if she would think the same. I realize this is only the third dish. All have been a work of art.

My server brings by a leaf of quintonil in a brown terracotta bowl for me to try after I mention I don‚Äôt know the word. It is light and fresh and tastes very green. This is the plant for which the restaurant is named. 

The fourth course is a tamal, but not like any other. This is not farmhand food, dense and packed with nutrition after a day of hard work. This is a delicate beast, soft corn filled with pato pibil - like cochinita pibil, my favorite, but with duck instead of pork - and topped with a delicate onion foam and onion seeds. I am in heaven. I am advised not to eat the banana leaf wrapping. He must have sensed it was in danger. 

The next tiny bite, he tells me, is not part of the menu but he thinks I will enjoy. I realize this is likely what he says to all the diners, but am not put out. It is a tiny tostada filled with a ‚Äúmole del mar,‚Äù which he tells me is one of the only moles made with seafood. It also has just three ingredients, compared to the 30 or 40 in traditional moles - I can‚Äôt help but think of the three year mole bubbling away in the back of Pujol, blackening by the day. The three ingredients are the undefined mariscos, chiles, and another word I don‚Äôt catch. The cookbook has been whisked away, so I can't check, but I agree that the one bite is delicious. He says it‚Äôs one of his favorite dishes. I tell him it is now one of mine as well. Unfortunately it is also one of the smallest.

I am still only on the fifth course. I jump to a glass of white from Valle de Mata. When the dish comes it‚Äôs a delicate piece of fish, accompanied by a salsa of cauliflower and plankton - seaweed most likely. It‚Äôs delicious and perfectly cooked. Before the server takes my plate he explains this is the most complicated dish to make, it‚Äôs turned constantly on the grill, cooked on a Japanese brasserie, and finished with a torch to crisp the skin. Totally worth it. I almost lick the plate. 

The sixth course is a giant spread of taco fixings. All expertly crafted, half of the ingredients I can‚Äôt remember. There are mushrooms marinated in chiles, tiny bites of sausage in a deep mole, aguacate and ant eggs, a tiny smoking cubed salad, a vegetable ceviche with tiger's milk made from smoked cactus. Spicy red salsa. 

If I haven‚Äôt mentioned it yet - my waiter has jokes. When he went to unveil the tortillas from their ceramic sarcophagus, he started with ‚Äúand here we have the live insects.‚Äù Live! I exclaimed. Yes! He said - you have to be very quick to catch them. With wide eyes, he lifted the cover to reveal.. linen napkins warming hot corn tortillas. He laughed at my concern. I had been ready to catch them.

Soon I am knuckle deep in a taco party. That is not a euphemism. It is delicious. I request three more tortillas, made from corn grown in the Yucatan, the waiter tells me proudly, before I run out of space. When my waiter returns he has more jokes. Don‚Äôt worry, he says - just ten more courses to go. I almost fall out of my chair. He laughs again and clarifies - one more main, then three desserts. I think I can do it. 

The next course is a panucho - a kind of fried tortilla from the Yucat√°n, with a dark mole, purpled onions, and pulled pork. Confusingly, it‚Äôs presented with cutlery. I eat it with my hands and suck the sauce from my fingers. I am brought a towel. 

After the mains have finished, he parades out a glass showcase of the insects I have eaten. Beetles for the sausage, red stink bug looking fellows for the salsa. Grasshoppers from something earlier. The ant eggs from the guacamole do not make another appearance, and he assures me the insect portion is done. He tells me this as if relieving a burden, but I didn‚Äôt mind them. 

The next small plate, I am told, ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt count‚Äù. It is a sorbet made from the nopal cactus and served in a chilled volcanic rock. I can taste the salt slivers and something citrus as well. Lime, probably. It is delicious. 

Next is a sorbet topped with caviar, cr√®me fresh. 

Then a maracuya ice cream sitting atop a warm corn cake. With actual corn pieces. I think this is my favorite meal in Mexico. It comes with a liquid - Rompompe? He tells me it‚Äôs made of vanilla, cinnamon, eggs. Like eggnog. Popularized by monks during the time of the conquistadors to sell and get money for the church. I say I‚Äôve never heard of it. I google and am told that in Colombia it is called Sabaj√≥n. That sounds more familiar.

Cinnamon coffee and a tiny cookie and we‚Äôre almost at the end. 

A strawberry tart. He brings me a shot of the aforementioned rompompe. It tastes alcoholic, sweet.

On my way out, the manager detours to steer me around the kitchen and the small army of sous chefs constructing tiny plates with tweezers. I think of coming back for the chef's menu. The staff here were probably the most kind and present while remaining unobtrusive that I‚Äôve experienced. But maybe I‚Äôm just a sucker for terrible jokes.

I'll be visiting your beautiful city soon and am an early riser. I'm wondering if there are any recommendations for places to grab an early morning breakfast, ideally between 5 AM and 7 AM?

I know traditional Roman breakfast is often a quick coffee and pastry, which sounds delightful, but I'm curious if any spots are open this early and what they might offer.

Any insights or suggestions would be so greatly appreciated! Grazie mille!",0,1752079043.0,rome,6,0.5,False
1lvngeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsGoTravelers/comments/1lvngeg/how_much_money_do_i_need_per_day_in_nyc/,How much money do I need per day in NYC?,"Living in NYC for the past 5 years has taught me a lot about managing expenses in this incredible but expensive city. I've hosted countless friends and family, and the most common question I get is about daily budgets. Let me break down the real costs you'll encounter.

For tourists, plan on spending $150-200 per day for a comfortable experience. This covers basic needs and some entertainment, but can vary significantly based on your choices. Here's my detailed breakdown:

Accommodation: $100-300/night
- Budget hotels in Manhattan: $150+
- Decent hotels: $200-400
- Hostels: $50-70
- Airbnb rooms: $70-150

Food: $40-70/day
- Breakfast at a diner: $15-20
- Lunch at a casual spot: $15-25
- Dinner at a restaurant: $30-50
- Street food/food trucks: $8-15
- Coffee and snacks: $10

Transportation: $10-15/day
- 7-day unlimited MetroCard: $34 ($5/day)
- Single rides: $2.90
- Uber/Lyft: $20-35 per ride

Activities/Attractions: $50-100/day
- Empire State Building: $42
- Museums: $25-30
- Broadway shows: $80-200

One activity I highly recommend splurging on is a helicopter tour of Manhattan. It's pricey ($249/person) but absolutely worth it for the incredible views. You'll see everything from the Statue of Liberty to Central Park in just 15 minutes. I recently took my parents on one through [this tour company](https://athometouch.com/Manhattan) and they're still talking about it months later.

Money-Saving Tips:
- Get the weekly MetroCard if staying 4+ days
- Visit museums during free admission hours
- Eat lunch at nice restaurants instead of dinner
- Stay in Brooklyn or Queens for cheaper accommodation
- Use sites like TodayTix for discounted Broadway tickets

Remember to factor in additional costs like shopping, souvenirs, and unexpected expenses. I usually recommend having an extra $100/day buffer, especially if you're planning special experiences like fine dining or shows.

The key is prioritizing what matters most to you. Some people prefer luxury hotels but eat casually, others stay in hostels but splurge on experiences. Manhattan can be done on $100/day if you're very budget-conscious, or easily exceed $500/day with luxury choices.

These estimates assume you're a tourist staying in Manhattan. Living here permanently involves different costs, but that's another topic entirely. Feel free to ask specific questions about any category - I'm happy to provide more detailed information based on my experience.",1,1752079013.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

1lvnfwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyGoodContent/comments/1lvnfwp/best_h11_led_headlight_bulbs_for_2025_my/,Best H11 LED Headlight Bulbs for 2025? My Real-World Comparison Results,"Most H11 LED headlight bulbs claim to be the ""[best H11 LED headlight bulb](https://www.fotizoace.com/best-h11-led-headlight-bulbs/)"", but how many actually deliver? After testing six top brands over three months and nearly going blind in the process, one stood out: FotizoAce H11 LEDs. Here‚Äôs the unfiltered breakdown.

**Brightness That Actually Matters**

Some brands throw around ""20,000 lumens!!"" like confetti, but real-world output? Meh. FotizoAce‚Äôs 6,000-lumen-per-bulb claim? Legit. The 6500K white light is stupid crisp, no murky yellow, just daylight clarity. Night drives on backroads went from ""hope I don‚Äôt hit a deer"" to ""oh, there‚Äôs a squirrel 300 feet away."" Bonus: The beam cutoff is sharp, so no angry flashes from oncoming traffic.

https://preview.redd.it/0pc2sy2bmvbf1.jpg?width=1111&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f43d31c6b4a618af14a242437156866ae2ca18cd

**Durability: No Early Funeral**

Ever had LEDs fry after two months? Yeah, same. But FotizoAce‚Äôs aviation-grade aluminum housing and silent cooling fan kept temps in check, even during a 4-hour road trip in 90¬∞F heat. They‚Äôre also IP68 waterproof and survived my accidental car wash power-wand incident. Most impressive? Zero flicker after hitting potholes that made my coffee cup levitate.

**Installation: No PhD Required**

Plug-and-play should mean plug-and-play, but some brands make you wrestle with adapters or cryptic wiring. FotizoAce‚Äôs H11s slid into my Civic‚Äôs housing like they belonged there. Took 15 minutes start-to-finish, and the included guide was actually helpful.

**Energy Efficiency That Doesn‚Äôt Suck**

My alternator‚Äôs not exactly a powerhouse, but these bulbs sip energy (65% less than halogens). No battery drain, no weird electrical gremlins, just light. Eco-win? Fewer replacements. These things are rated for 50,000 hours. At my current rate, they‚Äôll outlive my car.

**What Others Are Saying**

Scoured forums and Reddit threads, FotizoAce keeps popping up. Off-roaders swear by their weather resistance, while commuters love the beam pattern. One Tacoma owner called them ""the only LEDs that didn‚Äôt make my headlights look like a disco strobe.""

**The Bottom Line**

If you want the best H11 LED headlight bulb that balances brightness, durability, and idiot-proof installation, FotizoAce is the move. Want to [learn more](https://www.fotizoace.com/best-h11-led-headlight-bulbs/)? Hit up FotizoAce‚Äôs site for specs, vids, and real driver reviews.

I recently moved to Euless, Texas (Monticello by the Vineyard apartments) from Nepal. I‚Äôm on an H4 dependent visa so I can‚Äôt work at the moment.

A little about me: I‚Äôm almost 30, have a law degree (studied in India, lived there for almost 10 years before moving back to Nepal), and used to teach at a university there. My husband used to live with his cousin here, but after I joined him, we got our own place.

For the last few weeks I was busy setting up our apartment, but now that it‚Äôs mostly done‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm suddenly left with nothing to do. My husband works from home, so he‚Äôs here but glued to his desk all day. I tried watching shows and movies to pass time, but life has started to feel painfully dull, empty, and isolating. Every day feels the same and I‚Äôm worried I might slip into depression if this goes on.

I love home decor, cooking (especially Nepali & Indian food), and crafting. Back home, I loved hosting people and would have friends over for dinner or tea. But here, it feels so hard to meet people ‚Äî neighbors seem to keep to themselves, and I hardly see anyone around. I‚Äôm not super extroverted, but once I get to know people, I can be a warm and loyal friend.

If anyone here has been in a similar situation, how did you build a life here?
How do you make friends in a place where people don‚Äôt seem as open to chatting with strangers?
Are there local groups, hobby clubs, volunteering opportunities, or anything you‚Äôd recommend?

I would love to meet new people, learn more about American food & culture, share food from back home, or just have someone to talk to over coffee or a walk. 

If you live nearby or even if you‚Äôve just been through this, I‚Äôd really appreciate your advice (and maybe even your friendship).

Some parts i hope might help others, but im also still drowning and really need help and advice."," I havent really gotten a lot of interaction or feedback on this sub in previous posts and i understand most people wont read all this, but I just really wanted to type all this out in detail(sorry in advanced for how long its gonna be), and i could really use the help and perspective of any and everyone possible. Ive talked about this with friends and family and some strangers before, and theyve all had some good advice, but this healing is brand new to me and really really fucking hard. I wanted to share every intricate detail of how beautifully surreal it was, how heartbreaking it is to have your favorite person become your biggest source of pain and confusion, and things along the way of my healing process that have helped me or made it worse. I guess ill start with some background on us, at least stuff of it might pertain to the story. 

 I (29M) was a born and raise colorado kid, pretty easy childhood. I did a lot of partying in my highschool and college years. My hallucinegen experiments turned into heroin and crack when i was 19, i made life pretty hard on myself then, but i got sober at 21 of hard drugs(clean for 9 years now!) And straightened my life out. But i didnt get fully sober, alchohol became a part of my life a lot, i never snuck liquor during the day or got wasted pretty much ever, but liquor became my line of career, a passion and hobby of mine and i was an almost daily drinker. My dating life never had any drama. Almost all of it was either 1 night stands or fairly casual dating, couldnt really have anything negative to say about anyone i dated, until i met her. 

 Her (28F) lets call her KP, was a jersey/philly girl who moved out here a few years ago. She came from a dysfuncional family and basically spent her childhood raising half siblings. She was given up for adoption when she wasnt needed, was a little bit of a problem child, given up for adoption again and moved around between relatives. She went through sexual and other forms of abuse as well. She moved out here with her longest run relationship (7 years) and they both got a job working security for local music venues, i guess almost right after moving here and getting a 2 year lease together their relationship went to shit. He became abusive(i think they both became abusive and it was just an all around mess). They split up and he stopped working that security job but they were stuck together in living space for a while. Thats when she got a 2nd job at my work, i noticed her right away. She was different than a lot of other girls(typical cliche line i know), she was either someone people really loved, or felt that she was cold and unapproachable.

 I developed a crush pretty quick, apparently she did too, but her first attempt to make friends and socialize i didnt go and she really was hoping i did. A somewhat older gentleman who worked part time at our job and was a teacher for the boulder valley school district, did go and asked her out and they started dating. At the time i just had a small crush on her so i didnt really care and just went about my business. Im gonna use his real name though to honor him, his name was Mark, he was a really nice sensetive guy. He loved his students and was friends with everyone he met, including me. Mark was sober for quite a long time now, he had to be, his liver and kidneys were in terrible shape. Then it happened. He came in to work from the dentists, i remember pointing out to him that he didnt look good (face swollen and skin discoloree) he said it was from the meds he got, i was the one who walked in on him. In the one space with concrete floors he was trying to clock out for lunch, he kept passing out and cracking his head open and getting up and trying again. I came in and caught him from falking a 4th time and radiod and ambulance, he died in the hospital 2 days later. (Everyone at our work thought it was the head injuries, but i found out later it was stomach ulcers and organ failure, now she says he started drinking behind her back, idk if thats true or if he felt pressured to keep up with her younger self and her pretty heavy drinking). It was very rough on KP though, hit me pretty hard for like a week too. I was there for her to talk to if she needed and, she did a little, but i wasnt reaching out unless reached out to. I guess 1 or 2 guys from our work were pushy with her about consoling her, one even went to the hospital to see if she or mark needed anything, she did NOT like that. 4 or so months past and we didnt talk a whole lot but we started to talk more and more, she started to get flirty with me as she healed, she worked in the food area of our liquor store and started putting samples in my locker. I decided to tell her i like her and ask her out last april (2024). She seemed surprised but once she knew she became very foward and infatuated with me. 

 For the next 10 months things felt like a dream, we took things pretty fast at first. Our first date we made out before i even got her into my car, i held her thigh on the way to the sushi place. We drank saki and talked so intensley that the waiter didnt approach us for food till we said something 2 hours in. We walked along a nearby lake sat on a bench and talked more but also just listened to the ducks quietly, she really wanted to invite me in but i already decided this was gonna be something real, it took us 45 minutes to part when i parked in front of her house. Our second date at her place, we found out we had the same grateful dead album, she put it on the record player and we danced and drank wine and had very deep talks. She found out we had the same favorite dj too and i had never seen him, then and there she bought us tickets to tipperandfriends in alabama just a couple months down the road, not even an official couple yet. When she took me upstairs she pointed to her bed and said ""soooo this is where ive pleasured myself to you like a hundred times"" (like i said very foward lol), was an amzing night with her. We went to that festival spent 8 days in a row together and it was the best week of my life. We developed inside jokes, left each other notes, flowers and coffee, planned escapes on zillow. I saw her about 6 times a week, 2 or 3 days outisde of work. Hungout by the pool frequently, went to free shows from her work, everyone said we were their favorite couple, made fires and pillow forts, took drives to mountain towns. The sex was amazing and constant. 
 
 We had many things that let her know i was the one, cheesy things, lots of promises of always being there. One of her cats was so scared of people shed hide for days, that cat loved me right away. When she found out my spirit animal was an owl, hers was a lady bug, she schockingly went to a basket above her bookshelf and a stuffed ladybug and owl were in the basket as the only 2 stuffed animals she had. Just lots of things like that. She had bad ptsd sometimes and her trauma was a thing and talked about quite often, but she had me believe i was the best thing ever to soothe it, i thought so too. She was the first person ive dated to ever spend christmas morning just us two together, my lease was up april 1st (2025 now) hers was july 1st, and we decided christmas day to get a place together. At this point i knew whole heartedly that i was gonna marry her, ive never hsd someone i loved this much or i thought loved me that much. We talked about our future like we were gonna get old together. 

 The first week of march, everything changed, and spiraled fast. We no longer worked together at this point, which was fine, i still saw her 2-4 days a week and talked all day every day. Out or the blue her texts became 1 sentence replies, and we went from 80 messages a day to like 8. She was still working 2 jobs but was pretty burnt out, i thought it was that, but after multiple days in a row, i got worried and said something. Over the phone she became closed off, communication has NEVER been a problem with us. What i got out of her was ""im not ok, things are not ok, idk if were ok"", and she let us go to bed with just that floating around. I became so scared, i pushed to talk more. Over the next few weeks we didnt text but instead had medium length phone calls, and only made time to spend nights like once a week sometimes 10 or so days apart. Every other day something new was the cause of her being overwhelmed: work is too stressful and this is too much, to she needs me all the time and doesnt see me enough. She still needs to grieve, to she needs me more to help end the grief. Ect ect ect, very bipolar and ever changing. One of the things i got out of her was she was scared i was gonna die, we drank a lot and im a heavy smoker, and my stomach and gal bladder werent doing amazing. I told her ok and attempted to start drinking and smoking less, and being mindful of what i eat, and i kept her updated on my progress constantly to help ease her mind (mind you she made 0 effort to do the same, she drank a lot and still constantly pushed for us to do brunches and dinners where we ate a lot). My current job i was driving around a lot and i would get texts that she needs me where i would be over in 10 minutes or less to find her curled up crying and unable to talk. Id hold her hand and spoon her and rub her back. I constantly let her know shes ok, im ok, were ok, its all gonna be fine. But inside i was scared, confused, stressed, it definitely made for some slip ups in attempts to drink and smoke less. 

 We started to see each other more frequently again, our talks of living together didnt come up. But she needed to do an emergency move a couple months early(long side story), and she did ask for help picking out a place and input and comments were made that assumed id be living there. I helped her find a place and helped her move in 1 day. Things at this point were actually worse for me, instead of a small constantly worry like before, it was incredibly hot and cold. At times she felt manipulative with her and my emotions. She started lashing out at me, gaslighting, talking down, on a couple of occasions she even hit me out of frustration. One night i almost drank a full bottle of liquor, i confronted her and told her how much she killing me and mistreats me, that idk if i can do this anymore. It was a cry for help, i just wanted to feel her love and support like i have given her so fucking much over the last 11 months. I was honest with her about things the next day and said i still want us and believe we can fix all this. We didnt talk or see each other for like 10 days. I moved out of my place on my own to my parents like 10 minutes away from her new place. I made a promise to get fully sober, and i did, ALMOST 4 MONTHS TODAY! 

 She reached out, she didnt address a lot but she was apologetic and expressed a want for us to work too. My birthday was april 20th and she wanted to take me out and spend the weekend together. When i came over she was in that fedal position again, cry about how shes a monster and everyone always leaves her. I told her i would NEVER abandone her, i calmed her down and we went out to dinner, it was good. At dinner i told her i was fully sober almost 2 weeks now, i thought she would be proud. She became increasingly more irritated looking throughout dinner, the walk to the car she got mad, said i had lied about my drinking (i dont fucking know: i was honest the past few months about my progress, i was honest the day after i almost drank myself to death, i was honest now in telling her i decided i need a break from drinking, and she still drank the whole time). The car ride home was quiet and brutal. When we got home it was my turn to break down. But she comforted me, she took me to bed, we curled up and fell asleep like instantly. We woke up the next day and we fucked and laughed about it making her late for work, she took off in a hurry. We spent 2 more days together and it was the first time it felt TRULY normal, like we finally had gotten everything out. We did our normal favorite activities, she talked about where my stuff was gonna go and said if i wanted i could move in before july 1st and just start paying rent when i can. I left that 3rd night to go to my bowling league, she was very flirty and talkative over texts again, and invited me to go hot tubbing at the rec center, a 4th day in a row and were back to living together and her spirits are up, yes were finally back!

 That morning, she had work i didnt, i texted her if she was ready and she said yeah i guess she could get outa bed with the cats soon, i said great ill pack up and be there in 10 and ill see you there,  she said ""rude"", i didnt think anything of it, thought maybe was sarcastic that i was gonna be ready first. When i got there she didnt say hi back, she didnt talk, she even asked me to scooch away and that i was moving around too much. Never seen her like that even when things were bad but i left it alone and didnt wanna have this talk in front of people. I thought she was getting up to go to the sauna and she went into the locker room. I chased her to the parking lot and said what the hell why are we doing this again, she said she needs to leave for work and gave me a very cold kiss and i love you, my heart SANK. That night on the phone she said ""were not on the same page"" ""were broken"" ""this is the most casual relationship shes ever been in"" she went back to saying i lied about my drinking. She ended our year long relationship over text. 

 All the stress and pain she put me through, all the fear she expressed of me leaving and me reassuring her i never would, asking me to move again in just 2 days ago..... and she left anyways. My favorite person and first person i ever considered a soulmate. I gave her a week of space and tried to reach out again. I was told i was the one who cant communicate, to which i poured my soul out. She had little to say back, she didnt acknowledge any of the harm she didz she asked for a grateful dead pin she gave me and told me shed always be there back, and she left me with a simple ""you lied and broke me"" and an even colder ""i believe in you though"". 
 I hadnt stopped following her on social media yet and about 5 or 6 weeks after our breake up..... she was dating a coworker from her security job. According to the post they have been dating for a month, so about a week or 2 after we split, they were already taking trips together. I used to say ""i love you bunches"" every night before bed, that was written on a wine bottle in one of the pictures. I was sick to my stomach, the best year of my life and i was replaced in a week, and her life looks better without me. I stopped following on social media. 

 I went through it all. I blamed myself for everything. Depression. Anxiety and panic attacks. I couldnt eat or sleep well. I begged for her back. I had thoughts of taking my life, which ive never had before. My trust, my self worth, my confidence, my past present and future my one true love in 29 years.... all gone. I was, and still am, a mess. 

 Im still now on my road of healing, and ive made good progress. There are some things ive done that i think are healthy and would help other people in feeling like i feel.

1. Ive reached out to people, friends and family and even just small aquaintences. Im forcing myself to do things both old and new, even depressed. 

2. When im not distracting myself i am sitting with my emotions. Processing everything alone is key, and it sucks, but in the long run its the healthy way and is necissary. 

3. I completely removed her on all socials, i havent blocked her, and ive slipped up and messaged her again. But no contact and not seeing her face is helpful. Getting rid of all my momentos and pictures of us was really hard, but in my situation it was vital. 

4. Drink lots of water, its easy to get dehydrated and not notice when your nervous system is a wreck, staying hydrated is good to keep in mind frequently. 

5. Ive been taking care of myself. I havent had a single drink through all of this and im sticking to sobriety for the time being, even if i started it for her. Im exercising frequently. And im working on the things i did wrong in the relationship without being too hard on myself. I also am starting therapy this week and im working on my relationships with the people in my life who still care. 

6. This ones been hard but im trying to accept what happened. I dont have to be ok with her, but i need to let go of the fact that what happened happened. I cant control how others treat me or view me or the choices they make. I can only control myself. 

 I am now almost 3 months out from the breakup and this has all done WONDERS. Im starting to enjoy activities again, im seeing people i dont see often, people say i look great and healthy. Im crying less and less frequently every week. I can even sometimes start to imagine a different face when i fantasize about my soulmate. But it doesnt feel like enough. I still think about her multiple times a day, the frequency changes on a day to day basis. I feel bipolar at times. I cant let go of the version she was when things were good. I cant get her smile and laugh and memories out of my head. Our song still pops into my head constantly, and the urge to reach out and get her back and try and fix things. I still cry in the car at times. I still feel worthless sometimes and confused about our memories, and replay things in my head. I still have trouble grasping that my favorite person would do this to me, and who she turned out to be. The fear of the trauma she caused damaging my ability to love and trust someone again is still very very real and a constant worry. I dont know what to do. 

 If you read all of this (first off, wow thank you) id love to have your input, your advice. If you see things about me or her that i dont, and ehat your perspective is. If your going through something similar, or just shitty in general, share it! Id love to hear from people snd their experiences and thoughts. 

Thank you.

This is often not talked about by people who have made it and have grown to large teams.

They were once in your shoes: waking up early, staying up late, building things by themself.

All without knowing if their idea / business will ever be successful.

For those that are building something, a few things I've done to not feel lonely would be:

\- work at a coffee shop every now and then to change up your routine

\- join communities based on the business you are building

\- find a mentor or battle buddy that you can meet with regularly

\- go to meetups if they're in your area, even if they aren't related to what you're building

He would  even go on to joke once about üçá-ing me & would watch actual  üåΩ in the shop or disturbing vids - 1 guy 1 jar or ‚Äúcake farts ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ for example ‚Ä¶ - _ - 
& often times he liked Share his s3x life with us etc. going on to tellus in detail accounts of his past relations with people. 

I was 1 month out of high school at this point in my life (18h Him? 41.

I always thought that, Quite frankly his TMI was never  not appropriate for the work place. But I didn‚Äôt understand 

To add - He was insanely sexist, racist and homophobic. Often complaining about his an ex who was gay after he was with her‚Ä¶ 

I also witnessed him once tattoo a logo for a band called skrewdriver (I believe they‚Äôre a neo natzee band) on some guy. 

& not to mention his h8tred for  woman because he h8ed me & I‚Äôve seen his record‚Ä¶
His girl at the time called the shop once crying to me bout him, to me of all ppl - about his actions, and his drvg use (despite him ‚Äúh8ing dvigs‚Äù cos it would give his shop a ‚Äú bad reputation‚Äù) 

He h8ed gay people it seemed too cos he often talked down about my gay brother who was also only 16 at the time. He loved the F slur. 
He‚Äôd Pick on my clothes , hair , makeup and even my music idk why .. and dear lord he listened to fucckin NUMETAL 
The audacity tbh. 

He was a full blown alcoholic, a closet crack head (yet talked mad sh!t about drvg addicts and looked down on them like I previously mentioned - mad weird .) 

and he smoked cigarettes *INSIDE* the shop daily (against the law- against health codes- uhm literally open skin and blood-and air borne pathogens?! Tf) talk about gross asf 
When we cleaned we just used Clorox bleach sprays . Really no real disinfectant for shops at all . Just bleach. My machines corroded from this- rusted.

 I was his bitch for 2 years running all shop errands(especially when I got my truck) , cleaning up all his messes (including setting up his machines, pouring all his inks, and breaking it all down when done and sanitation and sterilization of all equipment *autoclave*) before disposal tubes and shit ‚Ä¶ the other people that worked and ‚Äúlearned  ‚Äú under him did not have to do this after being hired on. And they made more money than I did. 

He also had me running and  getting his food and cigs and coffee cos he didn‚Äôt drive nor did I (at first)  so I would walk in all weather for his bitch ass EVEN AFTER BEING HIRED AS A TATTOOIST to near gas stations, food places etc. for whatever the little baby needed‚Ä¶
I was beyond disrespected and violated in every way and he took total advantage of me. 

In the end he was 1 of 3 ‚Äú triggers ‚Äú the doctors  words not mine- they said in 2009 in my first psych stay- where I was admitted against my will due to trauma .. lucky me.

I‚Äôd also like to add that  it  is scary that when I share this-many other young people or people in general- come forward and speak about how they  have to 
 or had to endure similar - and I h8 that part 

I also have to add that paid him 3k in 6
Months for the ‚Äúapprenticeship ‚Äú and he claimed I was short ‚Ä¶ -  _  -  and when he was mad he would turn red and veins would pop. He would scream at us but mostly me. During those years he tended  scared me a lot tbh 

While apprenticing - Id gave him damn near my whole check weekly working 7 days a week 2 jobs and 70-80 hours between them both (and one was
To pay for the other so I got $0 most weeks)  . I remember Barely eating, smoking my moms cigarette buts (cos I couldn‚Äô no longer afford
To smoke) , & never going out cos if I called off I risked being Fired. 
This is why I missed skatopia 08-09
I even gave a friend my dad‚Äôs records collection for a ride home from the shop one night.

I also got my own equipment (1.5k) and I figured I‚Äôd have to do that tbh but jfc ‚Ä¶ he honestly did the most to hurt me and others who worked for him during those years  & it feels in retrospect that he this was his intent . 

He ended up rushing my learning months cos he seen me as a money maker for him. 
& when I‚Äôd ask questions about tattooing - how or what he‚Äôd claim I should know that!!  and not explain and make me feel stupid belittling me in turn cos he got a rise from all this weird behavior 

Anything that went wrong in the shop was somehow my fault too - a light fell once and shattered over night near my station (when me and my coworker opened - the mess was there when we came in!) and but next day I was to blame somehow .to elaborate was like the ceilings in school drop ceiling style - the cover for the fluorescent lights fell- shattered- my fault 
- _ -

So in turn I feel now was scammed and taken advantage of as well as used in so many ways while being harassed in the work place cos he was in a position of power and I wasn‚Äôt . 
All while he attempted to groom Me? 

I was at his mercy I felt and I didn‚Äôt wanna fvck that chance at a career up..but I also didn‚Äôt understand a lot. 

Sadly he projected sm Onto me and the other artists it was hard to work with I was always on egg shells in the shop. So My dream job began to crumble before my eyes‚Ä¶. As did I 

I once witnessed him throw a vacuum at my coworker cos he wasn‚Äôt cleaning soon enough.. he made the same coworker tattoo some ridiculous pro DV tattoo flash on him that read 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me tell you twice‚Äù
With a cartoon of a woman with a black eye.. wtf
The artist who created the flash sheet I think was William Web- can‚Äôt find the art now however tons of his other shitty work can be found on google‚Ä¶- how convenient 

 This boss I had tho  would go on to seemingly use intimidation tactics to break me of me ‚Äútimid‚Äù ways. He always said that I was timid‚Ä¶ I was a basically a kid..  he also referred to my bf who was POC at the time , as racial slurs and then would ask if I was headed to fvck him for the weekend as I walked to my truck 

.. Actually he often said this type of thing to me. And it now all lives inside my head rent free. 

To add, when I got to driving again- he copped rides from me any chance he could  cos his lisence was suspended for DUIS AND NOT PAYING CHILD SUPPORT 

he was even jailed for that when working with him‚Ä¶..

Fvckin a man

Cos I truly regret not but I also do not blame myself any longer

Anytime I asked a question she would answer in a very rude and impatient tone like I should already have everything memorized. I haven‚Äôt even been here a month. It doesn‚Äôt help that my manager has been scheduling me for a couple of days, giving me 4-5 days off in a row then I come back not really remembering everything. I‚Äôm trying my best.

1lvncbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lvncbz/sp_the_god_machine/,[SP] The God Machine,"Malcolm Murray woke up Saturday morning to the unpleasant view of his grandmother on her tiptoes, straddling his mattress. She was in her stockings and faded floral house dress, reaching into the dark recesses of the rafters. His metal bed frame strained with every one of her not-so-graceful movements.

It wasn‚Äôt unusual for Nana to be in Mac‚Äôs bedroom. After all, they did share it. But a ten-year-old boy must draw the line somewhere.

‚ÄúNana, you‚Äôre making me seasick.‚Äù

Without looking back to acknowledge him, ‚ÄúThen ‚Äôhaps it‚Äôs time to get out of yur boat,‚Äù she shot back.

Mac stood up and a heavy wooden crate dropped into his arms from above. ‚ÄúNow go find Mum.‚Äù

With only his red hair and green eyes visible above the crate, Mac struggled to traverse the windy route from his bedroom through the dank living room and onto the front steps where Dorothy, his wiry but strong mother, was sorting an impressive collection of scrap metal.

‚ÄúGood mornin‚Äô, Malcolm,‚Äù Dorothy said.

Only when the crate hit the ground did Mac catch his first glimpse at its contents. In it were an odd jumble of metal tubes and round dials and big switches. An old coffee can at the bottom rattled with rusty bolts and screws.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs all this, Mum?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúScrap drive. The factory‚Äôs sending a lorry,‚Äù she explained.

Mac knew about the scrap drive. His mother had been telling their neighbors in the other row houses on Beatty Street about it for weeks. It was her latest effort to single-handedly end the war. And who could blame her for trying?

Clydebank was six miles up the river from Glasgow, and until 18 months earlier, was best known as the home of the Singer Sewing Machine Factory. Almost overnight, Dorothy‚Äîalong with the rest of the factory‚Äôs 16,000 employees‚Äîwent from manufacturing bobbins to manufacturing bombs.

At the same time, Mac‚Äôs father, Paul, had been scooped up by the Royal Air Force and transplanted hundreds of miles to the south where he loaded those very same munitions onto warplanes on the coast of England. As Dorothy toiled away on her twelve-hour shifts, she liked to imagine her husband might soon be handling one of her bomb casings, and when the opportunity presented itself, she would secretly etch her initials into them with a hairpin, hoping that Paul would see it and smile. *Who knows*, she thought. *It might even be the very bomb that lands on Hitler himself.* *Wouldn‚Äôt that be something?* A husband and wife victory, made in little old Clydebank.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not askin‚Äô about the scrap drive‚ÄîI‚Äôm askin‚Äô about *this*?‚Äù Mac pointed to the dusty crate.

Dorothy looked down at the mess of metal and smiled. Before she could answer, Nana was there with an answer.

‚ÄúThat be your grandpa‚Äôs nonsense,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúHis *inventions*,‚Äù Dorothy corrected.

Nana rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúA mad scientist, he was. And more mad than science.‚Äù

While Dorothy and Nana carried donations to the street, Mac sat on the porch and pulled out Grandpa‚Äôs ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù for a closer inspection.

There was a dial with handwritten numbers on it. And a tiny pulley. And a benign-looking trap that suddenly sprung close, nearly taking Mac‚Äôs thumb with it. And buried at the bottom, five inches long and three inches wide, a metal box, sealed by a small screw in each of its corners. A cord dangled from the bottom. Sitting on top was a red bulb, in inch in diameter, covered in a protective tin cage. Beneath it, a pair of Greek symbols Mac didn‚Äôt recognize.

Nana was back for another load. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this do?‚Äù Mac asked.

‚ÄúIt ‚Äòdo‚Äô what all his other stuff ‚Äòdo.‚Äô *Nothing*.‚Äù

Mac turned it over in his hands, looking for more clues, when he sensed Mum‚Äôs shadow over his shoulder.

‚ÄúThe God Machine,‚Äù she said.

Mac wrinkled his nose. ‚ÄúThe what?‚Äù

‚ÄúPapa‚Äôs God Machine,‚Äù she repeated as she made the sign of the cross on her chest. ‚ÄúYour grandfather believed it could detect the presence of the Almighty Himself.‚Äù

Mac‚Äôs eyes went wide. ‚ÄúHow does it work?‚Äù

Nana returned for her last load and scoffed. ‚Äú*Work?* Ha. Your grandpa thought if he ran electricity through holy water‚Äîholy water he *stole* from the church mind ya‚Äîit would trigger ‚Äòsupernatural electrons.‚Äô‚Äù Nana laughed, remembering.

Mac smiled. ‚ÄúAnd that would turn on the light?‚Äù

His mother stared at it with a hint of sadness. ‚ÄúYes. At least‚Ä¶ that was the theory.‚Äù

Down Beatty Street came the familiar rumble of rubber on cobblestone. ‚ÄúLorry‚Äôs coming,‚Äù Nana barked.

She grabbed the God Machine from Mac‚Äôs hand, dropped it back in the crate, and kicked it down the steps toward the other junk.

Piece by piece Mum and Nana and Mac hoisted the scrap onto the back of the truck. Tin cans and aluminum siding and broken bicycles and useless car parts and a rusty weather vane and a watering can and a whole crate of Grandpa‚Äôs nonsense.

Everything but the God Machine. Mac swiped it from the heap and stuffed it into the pocket of his pajamas.

\--

It was late afternoon and Monsignor McDevitt was putting everyone to sleep again. That wasn‚Äôt conjecture. Mac could see it for himself as he stood at the front of Our Holy Redeemer Church, holding a dripping candle, and counting down the minutes till mass would be over.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit surprising anyone shows up to church at all,‚Äù he often thought to himself.

If it were up to Mac, he wouldn‚Äôt. But Mum left no wiggle room in this regard, especially with Dad gone. Mac and Dorthy and Nana were there every Sunday. Plus the ten official holy days of obligation. Plus the all too often weekday mass‚Äîlike today‚Äîwhen Mac‚Äôs number was pulled and he was thrown into a long, white cassock against his will. These masses were the most painful of all. From his lofted perch behind the altar, he could not only hear, but actually *see* his friends on the nearby soccer pitch as they laughed and played in those precious daylight hours between school and dinner.

*Oh the freedom that comes with being a heathen,* Mac thought.

Alas, Mac believed in God. Largely because he was told to believe in God. But could he point to any firsthand evidence? In all those painful mornings and afternoons in the church on Bank Street, had he ever experienced an undeniable otherworldly nearness? Not that he remembers.

His mother was a different story.

While others in church nodded off, Dorothy prayed. Her eyes clenched. Her fists in a tight ball. Her mouth moving but no words coming out. Mac recently asked her what she was saying, expecting her to recite back a long prayer full of fancy church phrases that don‚Äôt get defined to red-haired altar boys‚Ä¶ ‚Äúreconciliation of souls‚Äù... ‚Äúapostolic succession‚Äù... ‚ÄúEucharistic adoration‚Äù...

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just asking for help,‚Äù she explained.

‚ÄúHelp?‚Äù Given the state of the world, Mac wasn‚Äôt sure this was God‚Äôs strong suit. ‚ÄúAnd then what do you do?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I listen.‚Äù

This seemed like a strange system. Nevertheless, inspired by his mom‚Äôs devotion, Mac tried to tune out Monsignor‚Äôs never ending prayer and see if God had anything to tell him. He closed his eyes. He focused intently. He didn‚Äôt hear a thing. But after another minute, he did *smell* something. Smoke. Monsignor McDevitt‚Äôs stole was on fire.

‚ÄúMalcolm!‚Äù Monsignor yelped.

Malcolm opened his eyes to see what he had done. The flame was rapidly spreading upward even as Monsignor batted at it with his sleeve. Mac ran to the altar and grabbed the only liquid he could find, dousing the flame with nothing less precious than the blood of Christ.

Monsignor was indeed transfigured. His eyebrows lowered, his lips pursed, and he whispered just loud enough for Mac to hear: ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ are the *worst* altar boy in all of Scotland.‚Äù

\--

Mac sat on his bed that evening and weighed Monsignor‚Äôs assessment. He saw no flaw in it. He was a horrible acolyte. At last year‚Äôs Palm Sunday service, Mac bent down to tie his shoe before the procession and gored a visiting bishop in the bum with a bronze cross. At the Christmas Vigil, he tripped over his cassock, fell into the manger, and decapitated the baby Jesus. Of course those were both accidents. But did he take some delight in hearing the bishop yelp like a schoolgirl? Yes. Did he enjoy the snickers from the packed pews when the baby Jesus‚Äôs head rolled down the marble steps and Monsignor McDevitt chased after it? More than a little.

The summation of which left his ten-year-old soul in quite the precarious position if, in fact, the Omnipotent, Omniscient, Holy One was as near to Mac as his grandfather postulated God could be.

Because the bishop and the monsignor were only judging him for his antics in church. They weren‚Äôt witnesses to his colorful sins on the schoolyard or in the classroom. They also didn‚Äôt see the things he failed to do, which the nuns reminded him were also sins, along with the sinful things he merely *thought*, which, truth be known, were often the worst sins of all!

Mac rolled over and reached his hand under the bed until his wax-covered fingers struck something hard. He brought up the God Machine and held it quietly in his hands. He was no longer curious whether or not it would work. He was terrified that it might.

He unplugged the lamp between his and Nana‚Äôs bed. Then‚Ä¶ holding his breath‚Ä¶ he plugged in the machine.

It didn‚Äôt light. Not a dull glow. Not a brief spark. Just a deep indifference from the Great Beyond.

Mac‚Äôs terror turned to joy. He was more than relieved. He felt liberated‚Äîunshackled from the fear that God filled his days counting sins in order to gleefully punish the worst offenders. On the contrary, it seemed much more likely that there were no repercussions for anything. That all the rules piled on him were not ordained by God but created by nuns and monsignors and mothers to suck all the fun out of a ten-year-old‚Äôs existence. And if that were the case‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going out!‚Äù Mac yelled as he darted past Dorothy and Nana in the kitchen.

‚ÄúNow?‚Äù Dorothy called back. When she didn‚Äôt get an answer. ‚ÄúBe back for supper!‚Äù she added.

But Mac didn‚Äôt want supper. He wanted shortbread and something fizzy from the drug store. So that‚Äôs what he had instead.

And the next day, when he didn‚Äôt feel like going to school, he didn‚Äôt. He went fishing along the River Clyde‚Äîand caught something too! Then Mac walked back into town and exchanged the wiggly fish for two more hunks of shortbread. *I‚Äôm a regular tradesman,* he thought. After lunch he threw rocks at the seabirds from the bridge then walked to the soccer pitch, took a nap, and was up and ready to play when the rest of his classmates joined him from school.

At five o‚Äôclock, when the bells chimed for afternoon mass at Our Holy Redeemer, Mac delighted in the fact he wasn‚Äôt there. *Surely someone else could light the candles and ring the bells and carry the incense,* he thought. *Frankly, why didn‚Äôt Monsignor McDevitt do it all himself? He was the only one getting the quid people like Mum put in the collection. Only seems right he should do the actual work! But no, let‚Äôs make dumb ol‚Äô Malcolm do it for free, he thinks. Well, Monsignor, those days are over!*

Mac strutted through the front door a few minutes after six, proud of the mud stains on his trousers and excited that he would be doing it all again tomorrow. Dorothy and Nana sat in silence on the small couch.

‚ÄúHiya, ladies,‚Äù he bellowed. Mac slipped off his wet socks‚Äîtrophies of his hedonistic adventures‚Äîand hung them over the fire while he waited to see which of the two domineering women in his life would be the first to confront him.

Neither said a thing.

*Hmm‚Ä¶* he thought. *Hadn‚Äôt they‚Äôd heard from the school? Or noticed his glaring absence at church? Surely someone on Beatty Street must have seen him stuffing his face with shortbread in the shop when he was supposed to be learning his times tables.*

Mac searched their faces through the shadows of the firelight and noticed his mother was crying. He‚Äôd never seen her cry. Not once.

‚ÄúMum?‚Äù She looked up at Mac. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù he asked.

But even as he formed the question, he already knew the answer.

*Dad.*

A telegram rested in Dorothy‚Äôs lap.

‚ÄúThere was an accident,‚Äù Nana explained. ‚ÄúAt the airfield.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow bad is he?‚Äù Mac asked.

Nana put out her arms. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Malcolm.‚Äù Mac ran to his room instead.

He screamed and tore the curtains from the window. He ripped the sheets from his bed. He kicked his dresser until he heard the wood splinter. Then he saw the God Machine. He picked it up and threw it with all his strength against the stone wall of his bedroom.

Then Malcolm Murray fell face first on the cold tenement floor and wept.

\--

He woke up in the same spot a few hours later. It was still dark. Through the black, he watched the silhouette of Dorothy cross from the kitchen to her bedroom and then back again. He found her at the kitchen sink, packing a snack.

He couldn‚Äôt believe it. ‚ÄúYur going to work?‚Äù

‚ÄúAye.‚Äù

She moved with a stiff coldness across the kitchen.

‚ÄúRight now?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always short for the night shift.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt. Not tonight, Mum. *Please*.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe harder I work, the sooner this will end.‚Äù

She walked toward the door, resolute. Mac followed. ‚ÄúBut tomorrow maybe you could go to church? You and Nana. I‚Äôll go too if ya want?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Malcolm.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. We‚Äôll go and you can pray for help and then you can listen and‚Äî‚Äù

Dorothy turned and faced her son, a fog in her eyes. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt heard anything for a long time, Malcolm.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe anyone has.‚Äù

Then Dorothy lifted her sweater off the hook and disappeared into the dark.

Nana and Mac cleaned up the damage he had caused in sad silence. She saw no need to scold her grandson. For all her bluster, she‚Äôd endured enough heartache in her sixty-four years to know that sometimes the best gift you can give someone who is hurting is your silent presence.

Or at least she tried to do that. But when she picked up Mac‚Äôs blankets and threw them onto his bed, she discovered the God Machine on the ground beneath them and gasped.

‚ÄúOh Lordy, it‚Äôs a resurrection,‚Äù she said.

The machine had an impressive dent in the metal cover, but otherwise, grandpa‚Äôs solid engineering had weathered Mac‚Äôs meltdown.

‚ÄúI was just curious. So I kept it. But when I plugged it in, nothing happened.‚Äù

As much as Nana wanted to express her lack of surprise, she put a hand on Mac‚Äôs shoulder and gave him a loving squeeze instead. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she said.

He had been relieved when it didn‚Äôt work. But that was before. Now, though he couldn‚Äôt articulate it, there was nothing he wanted more than to see that small red light go on. For Mum‚Äôs sake. And, if he were honest, for his.

Mac fetched his father‚Äôs tool box from the kitchen cupboard.

His dad loved that tool box. Over the years he had curated the exact number of devices needed to repair every one of the house‚Äôs various leaks and squeaks. Whether it could make the God Machine finally work was another question.

Mac set up shop next to the dying fire and used a small Phillips head to remove the four screws. Even without them, the cover didn‚Äôt budge. Mac rummaged for his dad‚Äôs hammer and then the chisel, gently tapping along the seam of the device until the box cracked open like a clam. Inside, a thin line of copper wire stretched from its junction with the cord into a sealed vial. He jiggled it. Sure enough, two thimble‚Äôs worth of stolen holy water danced in the clear glass. Suspended in the liquid, the wire coiled into a tight circle then exited the other side where it was welded neatly into the socket of the light bulb.

Mac tightened the loose connections. Wiped out twenty years of dust. Then put it all back together and plugged it in.

Nothing.

‚ÄúTime for bed, Malcolm,‚Äù Nana said.

‚ÄúNot yet, Nana...‚Äù

‚ÄúMalcolm‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm goin‚Äô to get this to work!‚Äù

Nana relented. If she put him to bed, all he‚Äôd do is lie there in his grief feeling worse. Besides, Dorothy would never know if he stayed up a bit late. She settled into her favorite cushion on the couch and watched the fire.

Mac went back over everything. The cord. The wiring. The connections. The socket‚Ä¶

Then he realized. *The bulb*.

Mac lifted the protective tin cage and unscrewed the red, incandescent bulb. He held it up against the orange firelight and looked through the fragile glass.

‚ÄúThe filament! It‚Äôs broken!‚Äù

Nana took the bulb from his hand and gave it a shake against her good ear. ‚ÄúTis,‚Äù she said, her eyes growing weary. ‚ÄúWe can walk to the hardware store in the morning.‚Äù

But Mac had no intention of waiting. At the sound of Nana‚Äôs first snore, he was gone.

\--

At a quarter past eight on a Thursday evening, the Clydebank hardware store was long closed. But like most of the town‚Äôs shops, if you banged and hollered loud enough, eventually someone would open the door for you.

‚ÄúA ten-watt‚Ä¶‚Äù the white-haired owner said, rolling the bulb around in his palm as he walked in his slippers toward the far end of his shop. With war rations in full effect, it was slim pickings for even the most basic items. And this was no ordinary bulb.

Adjusting his glasses and loose trousers, he picked through his limited supply. ‚ÄúForty‚Ä¶ sixty‚Ä¶ sixty‚Ä¶ eighty‚Ä¶‚Äù No luck. ‚ÄúWhat color is this, anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúRed,‚Äù Mac answered.

‚ÄúA ten-watt *red*?‚Äù The specificity jogged his memory. ‚ÄúHold on.‚Äù

Mac brightened. ‚ÄúYou got one?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the owner said. ‚ÄúBut I remember sellin‚Äô one. Last year. Maybe the year before.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho to?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember.‚Äù

Mac slapped the counter with both hands in desperation. ‚ÄúWell please *try*!‚Äù

The owner put his head down and pulled at his lower lip until, ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

The owner smiled wide in satisfaction. ‚ÄúMonsignor McDevitt!‚Äù

\--

The rectory of Our Holy Redeemer sat at the rear of the church property. As Mac saw it, the only thing worse than attending Our Holy Redeemer would be *living* at Our Holy Redeemer. And yet this was the life Monsignor had chosen. Mac concluded there must be perks to the priesthood that Monsignor McDevitt didn‚Äôt broadcast to the larger congregation.

His first few knocks went unanswered and Mac grew nervous. Monsignor was grumpy enough when he was wide awake. How would he behave half-asleep? Especially toward ‚Äúthe worst altar boy in Scotland.‚Äù

Behind Mac, an elderly woman on a cane let out a glorious mid-March sneeze as she left the side entrance of the church and headed toward Bank Street. Mac caught the door before it closed and peeked inside. He saw a handful of sad-looking parishioners on kneelers. *Of course*, Mac realized. Thursday night confessions.

Now that was a perk of the job, Mac realized. A few times a week people come to you and share all their darkest secrets. Mum always said Monsignor was behind a screen so he didn‚Äôt know who was doing the confessing, but in a town as small as Clydebank Mac found that hard to swallow. If Mac were a monsignor, he‚Äôd keep a secret ledger of who did what with whom and leverage that information for financial gain or, at the very least, an entertaining bedtime read.

Naturally, Mac had no desire to confess anything. At least not to Monsignor. Then again, would he really be that surprised by any of his revelations? The more he considered it, the more he found it oddly comforting that he could speak the biggest, ugliest truths of his life and it would have no direct effect on Monsignor whatsoever.

He waited his turn outside the ornate wooden confessional. He decided he would just say that Mum sent him to the shop for a special light bulb and the shop owner pointed him toward Monsignor, and if he asked more follow up questions, he‚Äôd change the subject and say his dad was dead which would probably get him crying. That would shut Monsignor up, he figured.

Of course it would also involve lying. As Mac tried to calculate how many more days in purgatory he might get for lying *inside* a confessional, a woman stepped into the booth and shut the door. When she did, a light above the confessional flipped on. And not just any light.

The red light.

Mac brightened. Ha! He didn‚Äôt have to lie to Monsignor at all! He just had to steal the light. No no no. Not steal. *Borrow*. Obviously. He would return it. At some point. Probably.

Mac scaled the side of the confessional. The woman who went in the booth didn‚Äôt look like much of a sinner so he did his best to climb quickly. He gripped an angel wing and began his silent ascent. He found a foothold on a fire-spitting gargoyle and pushed himself even higher. The bulb was now within reach. He grabbed it gently but‚Äî ‚ÄúOck!‚Äù It burned his fingertips.

Mac pulled the sleeve of his sweater over his hand and made a second attempt. He slowly untwisted it from the socket, grateful he had misjudged the woman inside as more holy than she apparently was.

Finally, the bulb came loose. Mac held it, triumphant, when‚Äî

BOOM!

A piercing explosion shook the church, sending Mac falling from the confessional onto the hard marble floor.

Mac was stunned but only for a moment. He knew exactly what had happened. After ten long years, God had finally run out of patience and he had been struck by lightning. And deservedly so. *Unless‚Ä¶ this wasn‚Äôt God‚Äôs first blow*. Mac‚Äôs thoughts turned dark. Perhaps his dad‚Äôs accident was no accident at all. Perhaps it was a divine warning shot.

*Next time, Malcolm‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll be you*.

Then came a high-pitched whistle and a second BOOM. Followed quickly by a third. The confessional doors flung open.

‚ÄúMALCOLM!‚Äù Monsignor yelled down to him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Monsignor,‚Äù Mac cried. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry!!‚Äù

‚ÄúGet home, child,‚Äù Monsignor explained, trying to pull Malcolm to his feet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Germans.‚Äù

*The Germans?* The nuns were always chattering about the chance of an attack. Nana too. The Luftwaffe had been blitzing England from the air for over six months. Everyone hoped they would never come to Scotland. But if they ever made it all the way to Clydebank, everyone knew what they‚Äôd target first.

‚ÄúMum,‚Äù Mac realized.

Before Mac pushed himself off the floor, he saw the red bulb under a pew. He grabbed it, held it tight, and ran as fast as his wobbly legs could run to the Singer Sewing Machine Factory.

\--

He could feel the heat on his back from the shipyard, already in flames along the river to the south. He jumped across the railway and looked west to see burning tracks and twisted steel. The explosions were coming at such a pace that each one blended into the next, creating a hellish, unceasing roar on all sides. The closest ones blew Mac to the ground. Over and over. With each fall he held the small bulb high in the air, letting his knees and elbows take the punishment.

In the distance, Mac could see the tall Singer clock tower through the smoke, still standing. He pushed on despite the repeated, ominous whistles from above and the stream of workers stampeding in the opposite direction. He was inside the factory gate when the timber warehouse took a direct hit and ignited a forest‚Äôs worth of trees in an instant. It stopped Mac‚Äôs forward momentum and blew him onto his back. For a minute he was deaf, looking up as the silent fireball cut through the thick Scotland fog.

A woman appeared over him, her face covered in soot and yelled something he couldn‚Äôt hear. He shook his head and she tried to drag him away from the flames. He kicked and screamed in the eerie quiet. As his hearing returned, he could finally make out what she was saying. ‚ÄúYour mum‚Äôs ran home, Malcolm!‚Äù Mac found his strength again and shook her off. Then he sprinted south toward Beatty Street.

The nuns all said the Germans would take aim at Singer‚Äôs and the shipyard and the tank farm a bit further up the Clyde. They hadn‚Äôt considered the Luftwaffe would target the people of Clydebank. But when Mac jumped the railway and turned toward home, the smoke in front of him grew thicker. And as the drone of the German bombers faded into the night, it was replaced by sounds that were even worse.

Beatty Street‚Äîand every street around it‚Äîhad been reduced to rubble.

He slowed as he approached his front steps, not wanting to see what he already feared. But he didn‚Äôt even know where his steps were. Or where they had ever been.

Mac collapsed in the street.

‚Äú*Mum‚Ä¶ Nana‚Ä¶*‚Äù

He looked at the bulb, still secure in his hand. He wanted to squeeze it until it shattered. Until the shards of glass sliced his skin and the blood dripped down his arm and into the pavement on Beatty Street. An atonement for all the things he had done wrong. He stretched his little fingers as far around the bulb as they could reach and started to press.

‚ÄúMalcolm!‚Äù

It was Mum. With Nana at her side. Before he could stand, they had already pulled him up and wrapped him in their four arms.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alive!‚Äù he said from deep inside their embrace.

‚ÄúAye, ‚Äôcause we were out looking for *you*,‚Äù Nana answered.

Dorothy pulled away from him to inspect her son. Her body was shaking. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you run off to?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúI had to get a bulb,‚Äù he said, showing them his hand.

‚ÄúA bulb?! What in the heavens did ya need that for?‚Äù

Nana reached into her apron pocket and revealed the metal box with the Greek letters on top. ‚ÄúFor this.‚Äù

Dorothy was baffled. ‚ÄúWe gave that away.‚Äù

‚ÄúAye. Then your son rescued it from the furnace,‚Äù Nana explained.

‚ÄúThen you rescued it from the blitz,‚Äù Mac added.

Nana nodded, guilty. ‚ÄúI guess I always dreamed it would work.‚Äù

She handed the machine to Mac. He flipped open the tin cage and screwed in the bulb until it was snug. ‚ÄúThank you, Nana,‚Äù he said.

Nana nodded, then walked toward the rubble and sat down. Mac joined her. And then Dorothy. They sat in silence and looked at the place they had called home. What they would do from here or where they would go was a mystery. They had nothing. And Mac, starkly aware of his poverty, started to cry.

But as he did, he sensed something else. Something inside his grief. Something bigger. It called his name. And there, on the pile of rubble, Mac smiled.

‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶ I think I hear him, Mum.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

Mac held up the machine.

Her heart stirred. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he saying?‚Äù

Mac shook his head, embarrassed. ‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt make any sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me, Malcolm. Please, ‚Äú she begged.

‚ÄúHe just keeps repeatin‚Äô it, Mum.‚Äù

‚ÄúRepeatin‚Äô what, Malcolm?‚Äù Nana asked.

Mac smiled. Accepting that what he heard was true. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs sayin‚Äô ‚ÄòI love you.‚Äô‚Äù

Dorothy nodded. Nana too. In that moment, they lacked for nothing. Then they held each other close. And against Mac‚Äôs chest, unseen by any of them, the God Machine began to glow.

1lvnazx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1lvnazx/i_accidentally_ended_up_doing_ib/,I accidentally ended up doing IB,"just sharing my experience: (finance major, non target) NEVER intended to break into IB/high finance as i thought i am just fine with earning lesser but a WLB 9-5 life.

In Y1, my goal was to just find a finance role in automobile industry since i liked the industry but didn‚Äôt want a technical position. ended up doing sales intern for Y1 summer at SME (only offer).

For Y2, i faced financial hardships that made me want to aim for something pure finance instead for a higher SOL. so i applied for finance companies as well & got only 1 offer from a real estate MNC doing financial modelling (off cycle during Y3) and chose it over automobile offers. so i didnt do any in Y2 summer, but in Y3.

In Y3, i grew an interest in real estate so i ONLY applied real estate companies for Y3 summer, got FP&A at one of the top companies. (had no specific role in mind).

kept seeing my coursemates flaunting their FAANG, banks, tiktok or big companies‚Äô experiences & 4-5 internships already on linkedin. i truly felt like a failure as i only had 2 finance internships and none are ‚Äúhousehold‚Äù names or banks. i was so worried i would become a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù, being jobless after graduation despite being from the top university in my country (QS global top 15) and seeing my peers doing so well.

so i started spamming cold emails at SMEs (i thought MNC was unrealistic), i thought the more internships = better chances of getting a job. ended up getting 2 remote unpaid internships doing VC & PE.

at the end of Y3, heard about my friends banking experiences & grew interested in corporate banking as i thought its more achievable/realistic than IB + better WLB + more prestigious/money than BO. i spent everyday doing research & excel for CB, wrote commentary on banking happenings & included on my CV. & applied every open FO banking role. 

in the end, i didn‚Äôt even get a single interview for corporate banking (lol) but got 2 interviews for IB & Commercial banking. eventually got offers from both. so thats how i ended up getting a MM IB doing M&A at the start of Y4(BB applications were closed but chances are slim anyway).

i never went to a networking session, no coffee chats, didnt join any finance/business club, no boutique IB experience, didnt join high finance competitions, no prior bank experiences. that said, all my prior experiences coincidentally did align with skills IB needed (modelling + VC + FP&A + PE) & my GPA is acceptable (3.44)

tbh last year when i asked about my BO superday at a Goldman Sachs (didnt get it). someone even laughed at me for being happy about a back office role and said i will never get into IB with my CV. 

im just sharing my story so those who feel lost, just know that things will work out eventually even if in directions you least expect. and also sharing an unconventional story to breaking into IB so even if you dont feel like you may be the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù candidate, just apply because you never know!

(sorry for the long post, wanted to write my experience in detail)
update: well, i just wanted to encourage those who are figuring out their paths, but since some are upset that ‚Äúsomeone like me‚Äù can get into IB, all i can say is, try to be a better person, i cant help it if thats the way you feel the world.",61,1752078649.0,FinancialCareers,17,0.89,False
1lvna6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1lvna6a/i_tried_talking_to_my_mother_again_about_dating/,I tried talking to my mother again about dating and autism ‚Äî and it only made things worse.,"I just have meet my Mom today and talking about my life and how i can marriage and she‚Äôs talking to me this is all about convers she said to me
She claims she‚Äôs ‚Äúhelping‚Äù me, but the truth is: her words slowly kill me from the inside out.


üß® What she says to me (and I quote):
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou think any girl wants someone like you?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even have a proper job. You just do whatever you like. No one wants that.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou only earn 5-6 million VND (around $200). Life is hard. Girls don‚Äôt want poor men.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúEven if you date 10 girls, none of them will stay if you keep working like this.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOther autistic people are worse off than you ‚Äî they can‚Äôt talk, but they ride motorbikes, go out, have coffee. You‚Äôre not even at their level.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use your autism as an excuse. You‚Äôre just lazy.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou need to work for 2-3 years, prove yourself, then maybe someone will dare date you.‚Äù

She said all this in a harsh tone, calling me ‚Äúm√†y‚Äù ‚Äî a disrespectful way to say ‚Äúyou‚Äù in Vietnamese. It feels like she‚Äôs yelling at a dog.

üß© Here‚Äôs the twisted part:

She thinks she‚Äôs helping.

She says:

‚ÄúI give you money to join dating apps. If you want to go eat with a girl, I give you money too. I already help you with everything. What else do you want from me?‚Äù

But I told her:

‚ÄúMoney isn‚Äôt enough. I wish you also supported me emotionally ‚Äî helped me find someone who accepts me, understands me. Not just throw the whole responsibility on me like I‚Äôm some lost cause.‚Äù

And she got angry again. She said:

‚ÄúLook at yourself. What others expect of you is like level 10 for a normal person. I only ask you to reach level 3 or 4. Maybe level 5 or 6 at most. I don‚Äôt need you to be excellent. Just do something. Stop giving excuses.‚Äù

I tried to explain:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like asking someone without legs to run. I have a neurological condition. I‚Äôm not making excuses ‚Äî I‚Äôm trying to survive.‚Äù

Her response?

‚ÄúNo. You just don‚Äôt want to try. You‚Äôre lazy. Stop hiding behind your condition.‚Äù


üíî What she never acknowledges:
	‚Ä¢	I had no father. He left before I was born.
	‚Ä¢	I was abused emotionally and physically for years.
	‚Ä¢	I had no friends growing up ‚Äî I was bullied, mocked, isolated.
	‚Ä¢	I had such severe eczema I was in a wheelchair once.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve considered ending it all more times than I can admit.
	‚Ä¢	I only got diagnosed with ASD recently ‚Äî after over 20 years of confusion.

Despite all that, I still try. I still show up. I work. I create. I hope.
But she doesn‚Äôt see any of it.


üß† And yes, I know work is important.

I understand that a stable income helps build confidence.
But when you wake up every day being told you‚Äôre unlovable, worthless, and less than others ‚Äî it becomes impossible to stay motivated.

I told her:

‚ÄúSometimes I don‚Äôt even want to work because I feel like I have no one. No support. No love. What‚Äôs the point?‚Äù

And she said:

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just you making excuses. Other people with autism do more than you.‚Äù

üî• But autism is a spectrum.

People aren‚Äôt ‚Äúworse‚Äù or ‚Äúbetter‚Äù on some scale.
We all have different challenges.
Some can‚Äôt talk, but are good with crowds.
Some talk fine, but are crushed by social pressure.

I‚Äôm exhausted ‚Äî emotionally and socially ‚Äî every single day.

Recently, an older friend of mine ‚Äî around 50, almost my mother‚Äôs age ‚Äî gave me some heartfelt advice. He told me:

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for a woman who values kindness, simplicity, and family ‚Äî maybe try meeting someone from the countryside. Some women there don‚Äôt care about social media, don‚Äôt chase trends or money. They just want to build a good home. Ask your mom to help you find someone like that, someone real.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt saying it to insult me. He was trying to help ‚Äî in the only way he knew.
But when I told my mother what he said?

She snapped.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let me ever meet that guy again. Just hearing about him makes me angry.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe talks like you‚Äôre some useless idiot. Like you‚Äôre brain-dead or something.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf he thinks it‚Äôs so easy, why doesn‚Äôt he help you directly?‚Äù

I explained to her ‚Äî he wasn‚Äôt being negative. He just wanted me to have a chance at real love with someone who might understand me.
But she wouldn‚Äôt listen. She made it clear: she doesn‚Äôt like being reminded that I need help. That I‚Äôm different. That I might never make it without support.
So in the end, I‚Äôm stuck between a mother who throws hurtful words and shuts down real suggestions‚Ä¶ and a heart that still believes I deserve someone kind, even if the world says otherwise.

üß± I‚Äôm not asking her to fix my life.

I‚Äôm not even blaming her for not understanding psychology.
I just want her to stop saying things that destroy me.
Stop saying:
	‚Ä¢	No one will love me.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm lazy.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm a disgrace compared to other autistic people.

üôè I‚Äôm sharing this here because I can‚Äôt hold it anymore.

If you‚Äôve been through this ‚Äî emotional gaslighting, being compared to others, being told you‚Äôre ‚Äúless than‚Äù ‚Äî please let me know how you survived.
What did you do when even your own family refuses to see your worth?

Thank you for listening.

1lvn7hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodLosAngeles/comments/1lvn7hy/goodpeople_was_downgraded_to_a_b_after_rodent/,Goodpeople was downgraded to a ‚ÄúB‚Äù after rodent droppings were found on their grill but they‚Äôre displaying an outdated ‚ÄúA‚Äù sign in their window,"This is a follow-up to a post I made a while back about the ongoing weirdness surrounding Goodpeople Coffee [linked here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodLosAngeles/comments/1lrs1nm/whats_with_the_beef_between_goodpeople_coffee/)

That thread focused mostly on the strange dynamic between Goodpeople and Bonsai Coffee, plus the owner‚Äôs aggressive replies to negative reviews.

Since then, I discovered that **Goodpeople is still displaying an ‚ÄúA‚Äù health grade in their window even though they were downgraded to a ‚ÄúB‚Äù after rodent droppings were found on their grill.** The placard is dated 1/31/24, and does **not** reflect their current health status.

In October 2024, LA County Public Health inspected Goodpeople Coffee and found fresh rodent droppings on a grill and food storage shelf, along with unapproved outdoor food storage, structural damage, and sanitation issues. [Their health permit was suspended, and they were issued a ‚ÄúB‚Äù grade with a score of 82.](https://drive.proton.me/urls/7P5FMVWNPG#0ld8J6qZSoG9)

[Their permit was reinstated a few days later once the rodent issue was resolved but multiple other violations remained, including:](https://drive.proton.me/urls/1ZDJW88Y10#yuB1TjS0ZcwO)

* 40+ bags of green coffee beans stored in unapproved outdoor containers
* Peeling paint and missing wall panels in food prep areas
* Gaps in doors and accumulated coffee bean debris on the floor

A follow-up inspection on [November 14, 2024](https://drive.proton.me/urls/7Q7JE4CRJG#aN9oFCt4VsYW) confirmed these violations were still not fixed. A reinspection was scheduled for November 27, but as of now, no updated report appears in the public records.

Despite all of this, Goodpeople is still displaying a bright blue ‚ÄúA‚Äù placard dated 1/31/24 in their front window even though it no longer reflects their actual inspection grade.

Lots of great places get dinged and bounce back but given the strange behavior displayed by the owner, I can't help but think this isn't just an oversight. He‚Äôs repeatedly shown a pattern of avoiding responsibility in how he responds to negative reviews, he‚Äôs currently involved in a lawsuit with his next-door neighbor, and he often defaults to immature, insecure behavior when challenged.

When you ask one kid what his power is, he says, ‚ÄúI can give myself a nosebleed.‚Äù‚Ä¶Wait. Blood manipulation? Another shrugs and says, ‚ÄúI can charge my phone.‚Äù‚Ä¶Electricity manipulation?! Have they ever tried experimenting at all??","It was a daycare, really. 

Nobody expected these kids to be able to do anything worthwhile‚Äî least of all me. 

But in a world where people had powers, the asymmetry of strength made things messy for kids with dreams of serving their nation; of garnering smiles from the people they yearned to protect. 

Not from super villains, or petty crime, no. That had long ago vanished into the realms of impossibility. Robbers in black and white outfits with little masks; people using their powers to rob banks... it was enough to make one smile in remembrance of a better time.

A time before the *Scourge*. 

And when I saw that shining black vehicle turn onto the dirt road that led to our Losers Academy, I knew that the fight for mankind was going poorly. 

I set down my coffee mug and turned to the teens in their desks.

""I have to step out for a moment,"" I announced. ""You've got ten more minutes on your ethics exam, and then it's pencils down.""

Most of them had finished. I was mainly speaking to Rodney and David, and everyone in the class knew it. They didn't score any worse than the rest, but they struggled with test-taking anxiety. The two of them shot me a nervous glance as I turned and stepped out the front door. 

The humid air of August bore down on me and a cloud of gnats instantly swarmed me as I made my way off of the front stoop and started down the walk toward the drive. The tinted vehicle drew near, its tires crunching on gravel as the anticipation began to build in me. 

I'd been dreading this day.

When the vehicle came to a stop, the driver didn't cut the motor. The passenger didn't even deign to exit the car‚Äî they rolled down the window and that shiny brass uniform confirmed my suspicion. 

I didn't recognize his face, but a quick look at his attire told me all I needed to know. He had a square jaw, beady eyes, and wore a no-nonsense expression. I could tell by the bags under his eyes that his job wasn't an easy one.

""You run this shit hole?"" he asked.

""I'm Professor Alan Kirkland,"" I introduced myself, tactfully as I was able. 

He opened his mouth like he was going to speak and then suddenly started straight ahead and looked down in his lap. He leaned back, letting his head rest work for him as he played with the words in his mouth.

""Son. This nation faces dark times,"" he started.

""*Real* dark if you're here,"" I folded my arms. ""I've been wondering... *worrying,* really, about when I'd see you in my driveway.""

He scoffed. ""You're giving the tabloids too much credit.""

""And yet, here you are,"" I said, unflinching. ""How many do you need?""

""All of 'em,"" he said, staring me right in the eye. ""Every able bodied Super,"" he sighed. ""Even the flunkies... are to report to 1002 Evercrest Drive in one month's time."" He handed me an important-looking envelope engraves with the nation's insignia and sealed with wax.

""A month?"" I asked, losing my cool demeanor for the first time. ""Colonel, a month is not going to be enough. These kids have been deemed unfit by the state, what do you expect me to do with them in a month?""

""For once, I can say, that's not my job,"" he said, narrowing his eyes at me. ""It's yours, Professor. Get these kids ready for war. The Scourge isn't breaking against our best."" He looked forward and began rolling up the window. The tint was good, but it didn't cover his worried expression before it reached the top and sealed. 

The vehicle departed under a gloomy sky and a long silence. 

I looked down at the letter in my hand and sighed. 

""Dammit,"" I said out loud, turning and making my way back into the building. 

It was a circus when I reentered the classroom. Everyone was talking, laughing, joking around, and out of their seats, only returning to decorum when they noticed me, jaw clenched, and unenthused. 

""Has everyone handed in their test?"" I asked. 

""Yessir,"" they spoke in unison as I picked my coffee mug up off the window sill and walked to my desk. I sat down and stared at the stack of papers on my desk before looking at them all over the rim of my glasses. These kids were flunkies, but they were *my* flunkies.

I wasn't about to let any of them die horribly.

I stood up and took a deep breath and held it a moment before letting it out.

""Class,"" I announced. ""We're going to war.""

The little dummies cheered.

I rubbed my eyes with my thumb and forefinger under my glasses.

This nation was doomed.

This time, I‚Äôm trying something different. I‚Äôm testing whether I can still lose weight by sticking to a calorie deficit but eating something I truly enjoy, instant ramen. I skip breakfast and lunch, and just drink coffee or an energy drink to curb my appetite during the day. Then for dinner, I allow myself a pack of my favorite ramen and add a bit of protein, making sure I stay within my calorie limit.

I‚Äôm on day four now and honestly, I feel fine. I actually look forward to dinner, and it hasn‚Äôt made me feel deprived or miserable the way other diets did. I know it‚Äôs not the healthiest approach, but I‚Äôm curious to see how far I can get by combining calorie control with food I love. Has anyone else tried something similar?

* She liked me with a message (good start) June 24th via app
* We had good banter and texting convo and then went on a date July 3

It went well‚Äîwe both expressed wanting to see each other again. Later, she mentioned she held back on kissing in public because she wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd feel, even though she wanted to (very queer woman moment). I didn‚Äôt feel we were quite at that stage either, but I‚Äôm easygoing about that‚Äîfirst kisses can be awkward.

I set up tentative plans for the following week. She said she‚Äôd try to move a client but also has a midterm and needs to focus for the next two weeks. I respected that and said so, but also mentioned that momentum matters to me, so if she could carve out a few hours one night, that‚Äôd be great. She got it.

Texting after the first date hasn‚Äôt been much‚Äîshe takes about a day to reply, so the momentum‚Äôs been pretty flat. It‚Äôs only been one date, so I don‚Äôt expect deep convos or to be a priority, but the timing was not in our favor.

A few days before the possible second date, I checked in. She reiterated she‚Äôs interested but needs to stay focused on her midterms. I think she felt in my text that I was losing interest because she kept re-iterating that. I believe it's true, but I also believe out of sight out of mind and a certain momentum is necessary to keep something alive, especially so early on.

Basically, if we do see each other again, it‚Äôll be three weeks between dates‚Äîafter just one date and not much texting, that‚Äôs kind of meh for me. The connection isn‚Äôt really deepening right now, especially without quality conversation.

It feels like the texting we do have isn‚Äôt moving anything forward (it was better before we met‚Äîprobably when midterms weren‚Äôt weighing on her). I‚Äôm thinking of sending her something like this (see edit context below)

>Hey, I really enjoyed our date and I‚Äôd be up for seeing you again after midterms. I‚Äôm someone who likes keeping some connection going in between, but I‚Äôve realized that the way we‚Äôve been texting doesn‚Äôt really work for me ‚Äî I prefer when there‚Äôs a bit more time and attention behind it. Totally understand you‚Äôre busy, so feel free to reach out when things settle and you‚Äôre up for reconnecting properly. Wishing you the best with exams!

I'm also not holding my breath and would be fine if this connection died out.

TLDR: 1 date, 3 weeks until the next one (at the soonest), texting is not advancing the connection or momentum. What would you do?

EDIT:

She'll ask me a question and I don't really feel like continuing the convo via text as she doesn't have the time/focus for it but is asking me questions here and there. So last time I said I'll tell you in person! ""Speaking of which (and then asked about her schedule)"". Where I was coming from was from that place, I don't want to ghost, I don't want to not answer but I am not going to answer if she doesn't have the time and focus for it. Make more sense?
