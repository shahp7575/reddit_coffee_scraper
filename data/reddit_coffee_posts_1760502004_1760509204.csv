I see lots of posts of people who are just finding out their BRACA status. Is it because I‚Äôve lived with this for so long that I feel like it‚Äôs average Tuesday coffee gossip or have I gotten that cynical?

A few girlfriends have found out they have BRACA and they have come to me devastated, which I totally get. But they ask me how I cope and I‚Äôm kinda sitting here like ‚Äú member in college when you thought I was insane for switching doctors like five times in a year cause they kept denying me a mammogram and an mri? This is why‚Äù I have been dealing with this outcome since I was 12. Not to be gross but I started my period the day my mother went into surgery for a mastectomy. I‚Äôm 34 I‚Äôve got 22 years of this hanging over my head. 

One girlfriend called and was furious that I didn‚Äôt tell her that I had to go back in for a 3rd surgery. Like cupcake it‚Äôs an average Monday for me. I was only supposed to have two and now it‚Äôs like a a Harry Potter style series of events. I let people know I was okay after. And I don‚Äôt let people come and visit when I‚Äôm done having surgery except my dad. I‚Äôm bitchy, hot, drugged to hell and back, and mostly just want a slushie. 

Mostly I want my life back. My skin isn‚Äôt healing like it should, BUT I have a completely closed front on both sides. Just the right under side is being a pain in the ass atm. I‚Äôd like to go back to the gym and lift. I wanna do my job like my full job not this paper pusher desk crap I‚Äôm stuck on till I full heal. I would LOVE not to have to worry if I‚Äôm eating enough protein in one meal. Like I did my time. I spent many a college night getting blackout ignoring a looming cloud. Any lump or bump I stuck my head in the sand or bit my nails down to stumps. I‚Äôve been the nervous Nelly. I‚Äôm tapped out, it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs turn.

1o738tw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o738tw,My magic moonlight wreath,"I jumped on the Hobbii magic moonlight CAL a bit late but got really enthusiastic and finished up the last of the sewing with my morning coffee before work today.

It was a challenging project, I started crochet this year and while I‚Äôve made multiple Pica Pau amigurumi this was a whole other level of complexity. The instructions were really clear and it was a lot of fun to see it come together. The final part of sewing it together was a headache though, it‚Äôs all very 3D and difficult to get good angles, and all of my pins are too short so I just had to sew on the go. 

Had anyone else done this project? How did you find it?

Project details:

Yarn: I bought my own yarn so it‚Äôs not identical to the Hobbii set.

Schachenmayr Catania - black (00110)
Friends 8/4 - sunflower (24) 
Friends 8/4 - lilac (63)
Friends 8/4 - navy (86)
Friends 8/4 - anthracite (122) 
Friends 8/4 print - summer sunrise (01) 
Diablo - Lilac (62)
Diablo - cobalt (31) 
Silver thread from my stash

Size: I had to size up my wreath to 30cm diameter (I bought a set of four sizes of rings which I‚Äôm glad I did!)

1o736lq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o736lq,Ordering Universes Beyond From the Hasbro Website is absolute Hell.,"It started like any ordinary morning, except I woke up knowing today was the drop‚Äî
 the Universes Beyond Magic: The Gathering Furby Edition. I laughed about it at first, in that way you do when you think the world‚Äôs gotten a little too weird, but deep down I was curious. Not excited, exactly. Maybe a little desperate. I tried to tell myself I didn‚Äôt care, but it‚Äôs hard when you‚Äôve played Magic for years and suddenly, here‚Äôs this bizarre mashup that everyone‚Äôs talking about. The kind of thing you know will vanish before you even get a shot at it.

The sun was barely up and my phone was already buzzing. The official Wizards site announced the sale with that usual cheery tone, all pastel-colored Furby heads floating in a sea of cardboard. I felt a nasty little itch in my gut, anxiety, maybe, or just that old, familiar FOMO. I poured coffee, hands shaking as I checked the countdown again and again. The worst part was knowing I‚Äôd get sucked into the circus, even though I hated everything about it.

The page loaded slow, like it always does when you actually care about something. I refreshed, heart thumping, convinced I could hear the seconds scraping past behind my walls. It was almost funny, how much pressure can build from something so trivial, how you can feel watched, not by people, but by the faceless presence of a company that knows exactly how to twist the knife. The site crashed, of course. I stared at a frozen spinning wheel, my own reflection warped in the black screen. I could almost hear laughter echoing from somewhere deep inside the wires, like the sound of a thousand Furby eyes blinking open in a dark room.

By noon, I‚Äôd gotten nowhere. The forums and subreddits and discords were a mess, stories of failed transactions, products being sold out, bots, carts emptied in the final second. I scrolled and scrolled, reading the same stories, that same collective panic. People begging, people raging, people laughing at how broken the Secret Lair website had become.

The drop was over. Sold out, the page said, as if it hadn‚Äôt been mocking me all day. I stared at the words for a long time, feeling empty. Not sad, not angry, just tired. I thought about what Magic used to be.

Wizards of the Coast doesn‚Äôt care about people like us anymore. That‚Äôs the real horror, I think. Not the missed drop, not the laughing Furby faces, not even the bots. It‚Äôs the slow realization that the game you loved is gone, replaced by something hollow, something stitched together out of other people‚Äôs dreams, just so Hasbro can squeeze out a few more dollars. And just outside my window, the world kept turning, cold and indifferent as a pair of plastic Furby eyes, blinking in the dark.

1o735lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o735lw/heart_broken_in_3/,Heart broken in 3,"One night I met this girl and we hit it off straight away. She was cute, bubbly, giggly and our energy synced straight away.  Some guy tried to grope her and I got him away from her then offered for her to crash at my place and we cuddled all night talking.

Within two weeks of talking we were officially dating. She liked to party, drink and smoke which I didnt like the smoking but I looked past it. I went with her to a few parties and the same thing kept happening. She would get drunk, leave me by myself so she could go mingle and then it would look like she was being flirty so I would get insecure and uncomfortable then walk around the block to calm down then return as I didn't have a car back then. I would always explain how I felt and she would apologize but the same thing would happen the next time we were out drinking.

One time her best friend's boyfriend pulled me aside and told me that they had made plans for a 3sum before I came around and it was happening whether I like it or not. I talked to her about it and she said she remembered discussing it with them but didnt know they were serious and she swore she wouldn't. I thought she was a virgin like I was but when I asked she said she had slept with 7 people before me, which I was not happy to hear and unfortunately lectured her about it because I was upset. (15 years later She says it was a lie she told everyone back then and she was actually a virgin too)

Few weeks later at a party of her close friends, we were all drinking in the lounge but my girlfriend her BFF and the boyfriend all went into the bedroom, we heard a loud crash and found the three of them on the floor laughing with the bed snapped in half. Later I went back in to check on them when they went quiet and I found my Gf cuddling her BFF while the BF was cuddling my Gf. I tried to wake her up and get her to move and instead she gets up and slaps me across the face and moved to the other bed, going back to sleep. I went and walked it off around the block then slept in the lounge. Tried to talk to her about it in the morning but she said couldn't remember it but apologized and i forgave her.

We had my first time a few days later. A few days later her religious friend convinced her of abstinence, which I objected saying it would have been fine if she did that before doing the deed with me but I wasn't okay with it now.

She started uni in the city a few weeks later so I would drive from my place to the train station (40 minutes) to catch the train with her in the mornings, then have lunch, then ride the train home with her. One of the days while I was waiting for her to finish, someone took her phone and said she didnt want to be with me anymore and to just leave. After alot of back and forth I decided to confront the person and when I went to the class passed alot of people then found my girlfriend walking out so I asked her what that was all about and she said someone must have had her phone. Usually her phone is stuck to her hand so this seemed weird to me.

2 months later I found out i found that she rented a house and was flatting with 2 female course mates and her ex boyfriend who doesn't go to uni. She said hes only there to help pay rent and he was staying in a sleepout so not even in the house. I had only found out from a bebo photo she put up of her with rosey cheeks (been drinking)  being in the middle of a cuddle of two other guys I didnt recognize with her 2 classmates in the background. One of the guys was wearing the earings I bought her as a gift to add insult to injury.

I stayed over a few times before being hospitalized with a ""flu"" or something which she stayed with me the 2 days in there till I got released. She had a flat party that night and she went even though I was still really ill. I had a pit in my stomach so I showed up to the party and when she saw me she lead me to the room and said I can stay in there and rest then closed the door and went back to the party. I came out and sat in the lounge and she came and sat next to me. One of the guys from the bebo photo came and sat next to her and whispered in her ear, she giggled and I watched them whisper then walk in the kitchen and start chatting with some other people. I followed her out and observed, then they walked past me back to the lounge so I got upset and went for a walk to calm down. Long story short I got a call from her new bestie to come back asap as she is drunk and the guy is trying to get with her and she is wondering where I went. So I headed back she hugged me, said she was tired, the guy was banging someone in our bed so I told him to gtfo and kicked him out then she got in bed, I got her out, changed the sheet then we went to bed and had ""adult time"". I got up for some water saw her flatmates in the lounge looking through my partners camera and saw some photos of her and the guy sitting on our be with him kissing her cheek while she giggled. And there was multiple of them. I questioned her the next day and she said he kept doing that whenever she tried to take a photo and kept pushing him away.

Fast forward the messy flat breakup, the mess of her family finding out she was pregnant, the birth of our unplanned child, moving into my parents house. I was the sole worker and she was a loyal stay at home partner. We never had any issues during this period. We had parties and stuff without issues apart from my anxiety and introversion. 

There were a few instances where I had females hit on me but I didn't indulge it as is believe in loyalty to my partner and that she is the only one for me.

Skipping ahead a few years to where inflation made it so we both had to work she started a new job and I could feel she was coming home drained and emotionless towards me, we would have intimacy once a month if that and life just became work and I would game while she would live on youtube. She would get stinking drunk at the work functions and I would have to come pick her up, (often passed out or vomiting) and when we got home no matter what state she was in, she was not interested in intercourse with me. She would have a guy from work drop her home alot when I couldn't get her (even though there is a bus system) and she went to a few of his parties which made me wary and when I went to his poker night she sat next to him while I was on the other end of the table. She always said hes with ---- you dont need to worry about him. Then he left the company and O had a sigh of relief but still she would come home drained but be bubbly towards everyone.

During the 10 years that passed, her parents reconnected with us, we got married and had a second child. She was still acting the same towards me (drained and numb) but bubbly towards everyone else except when we went on holidays or date nights together was when her old self would shine through to me but as soon as were home, tired. Guys at her work were still a worry and My work was not working out so she got me a job with her. There was me thinking its going to be easier to know whats going on first hand. It wasnt.

5 years ago, She was the manager and I was working under her. I could see the trade customers would make weird comments, stare at her body and she would giggle and laugh with them as if it was all okay. There was one guy in particular that she would go out the back and they would talk for 20 minutes at least 3 times a week. She would be laughing hysterically, waving her hand around and pat his arm/shoulder and it made me so uncomfortable but whenever I would bring it up she would say hes happily married and wouldn't do that and she wouldn't do anything. One day she had to come clean because she had told him about a colone she liked and he went out and bought it, into her office with it on and got her to sniff his neck. She said she felt uncomfortable and told his rep but when I talked to the rep about this more recently they said they never heard about anything between my wife and him.

Eventually 3 years ago, she moved up to area manager and I moved to manager. Staff would watch her bully me at work telling me what to do even when it was something she could manage and my staff hated that. My wife would have to travel for work and whenever I would ask where she is going today I would get a why? Or why do you always ask that? Rather than answering the question. She would still treat me like a ghost at home and live her home life watching youtube of other people living their life and that killed me inside but I wasnt going to leave her or my children behind.

Because I wasn't getting any emotional conection at home i invested more time into my friends, helping them with their cars going on road trips and just hanging out. One day, my staff members car had broken down and I was more than happy to go fix it. She had expressed how my wife was treating me was wrong and I should complain at work multiple times or at least stand up for myself, but we also had some really engaging discussions about aliens, politics, life and adventures. I felt like I had found a great connection to a new friend. I had a work event I had to do with her and it was fun we chatted while giving advice and after we finished, walked around the venue trying all the different foods, alcohols and had such a good time I asked her to chill at the beach afterwards. We sat there listening to the waves talking about our lives and what we had endured in our childhoods to be here now and it was such a wholesome moment. I dropped her home and we continued to be friends until things went pear shaped.

Other women at work were telling my wife that something was going on between me and this girl which was making my work and home life increasingly volatile. One day the girl came in my office crying and said I cant stop dreaming about you! I was so shocked and surprised I didn't know what to say. I consoled her for being upset and this is where my wife started making it difficult. We had discussed everything as a couple and I said I didnt feel the same as the girl but my wife said that I had to feel that way too as she had been drumming into me for a few weeks and I blurted out so what should we just have an open relationship then and she said well i chose the tradie which is exactly what i was worried she would say, so i said f it and we agreed. My wife dressed me up I went around to the girls house who was so surprised about the whole thing and said she was keen, then we started. It only took me going on 3 dates to see I was really into her and my wife had massive breakdowns and regrets after the third time and said I needed to end it with the girl. When I went to sleep that night I woke to my wife texting someone about meeting at a coffee shop the next day and when I asked about it she quickly closed her phone and said it was a staff member she was buying coffee for so I didnt end the relationship knowing it was to meet the tradie and that following night my wife ended it with me because ""i didnt do ehat she asked"". We both cried, I said I would stop and she said its too late. I told the girl it was over between me and my wife and she said you need to fix it and ended things with me aswell.

The next day my wife told her work friend who then got other people involved that I had been dating this girl which made a huge problem for the 3 of us because it spread through the work place. It devided everyone into teams My wife, the reps and my 2ic against Myself the girl and the other staff that hadn't put it together. The higher ups didnt talk to me and bypassed me for everything to my 2ic. Noone was speaking to me at work except for the girl and when she saw I was not looking after myself she would buy me food on lunch breaks and bring it to me while I withdrew in my car.

As christmas drew near I had a family Christmas event and because I hadn't told any of my family yet, I brought my kids and let my wife come with. There were substances there with I tried for the first time and she had some too but next minute everyone is in the room with her she was balling her eyes out saying how I betrayed her and that she loved me so much how could I do this to her. Everyone that night kept picking fights with me without hearing my side of the story and when it came time to leave my wife wanted to stay there so my daughter and I made the trip home and I had to go collect her the next day.

Leading upto christmas I had given up on her and turned my attention to the person that kept showing up for me and after new years I moved out on my own and started dating the girl again.
We had a great time exploring new places, going on dates etc but there were always things that got to me. She was always buried in her phone, texting, reddit, videos etc when she was with me but would take hours to reply when I wasn't around, which left me thinking I was a convenience rather than her partner. She also smoked weed 2-3 times a night which would leave her in a trance where she couldn't hold a discussion or would just pass out into a deep sleep.

After 3 months, the distance got too much for me and I told her if she couldn't change it was over then she turned it around on me and said that I was the one being distant and a bad partner and she could do better. We were broken up for 2 days before I reached out to talk about it and she was happy that I contacted her. So we went out for dinner she broke down crying apologizing for how she treated me and that she was only trying to protect herself but that she didnt want to end it she just ended it first so it didn't hurt as much. So I accepted her apology and we got back together. We both agreed not to let anyone at work know we were back together to make it easier which means I didn't tell my wife either because of what happened last time. 

A month or so in the same patterns had returned. she was distant taking ages to reply, didnt seem worried about my feelings when I would discuss them and made me again feel like I was just being kept around. Meanwhile whenever I would go to see my kids my wife would be cold so I felt like I was getting that at both ends. I stopped trying to please my girlfriend and went to doing what I wanted to which was reconnecting with someone. I was being friendlier to my wife and giving the distance my girlfriend gave me to see if she would notice but didn't really at first.

I started testing to see if my wife actually hated me or was just hiding feelings and it turned out she still cared. I ended up spending more time with her and eventually slept with her. I had my girlfriend on the other hand now realizing there was distance and trying to pull me back in too which made my time difficult and everything was far more stressful. We had a work function come up and as we were given hotel rooms I wasnt going to say no to a free room even though my girlfriend didnt want me to go. I ended up getting pretty drunk, being carried to my room by the wife and trying to sleep with her before passing out 30 seconds in.

I woke up to being hit or shoved and she had taken this time to go through my phone and read all of my messages between my girlfriend and I and told me I needed to figure out what I really want because she wasnt okay with any of this. When we got home I didnt say much to my girlfriend for the first couple of days trying to work out how to tell her. When I did tell her, I said she deserves better, and that I would be there for her if she needed but she freaked out and begged me not to leave and that we could work through it, never to lose contact etc, then I left.

I messaged her as I said I would but had no response. She had ghosted me, and for good reason too. It had been 1 month before I heard from her again during that time my wife and I had tried to work on things but the contact with the girl kept holding us back. I went to meet up with her to hear what she said and it was basically a lecture of how I hurt her at first, then she explained how she missed us and how we used to be, I told her that things had changed and that I was working on things with my wife and she said okay like it wasnt a big deal. A few weeks later we had a counciling session and my wife was upset because I had met up with the girl to chat without her knowledge  so the councilor basically told my wife to leave me if I dont cut contact and we had an discussion about it and I said I wasn't ready to let go, so we ended things.

Shortly after I got back with my girlfriend who wanted proof I had changed so she suggested while her flatmates were away on holiday that I come stay with her for the week so she wasnt home alone. It was going well until we had a spat about cooking differences, about what to do in our down time and we would go to bed but she would sit on her phone instead of interacting as a couple. All our deep conversations had turned surface level, and our time together just turned into being present which im not about that. When I tried to discuss it with her she had a go at me saying none of her exes had a problem with her smoking weed or being on her phone and that deeply upset me so I told her to go back to those losers then and packed my stuff. After a trip to my car she said wait and wanted to cuddle with me and so I caved and I tried to talk through the issue but she rolled over and went quiet, falling asleep shortly after so I got back up and packed all my essential stuff then went to sleep. The next few days things were good until Sunday when the flatmates returned home. All of a sudden shes saying oh I need some time alone and when I pressed her on what that meant she said she needed to go to sleep on time for work (she went to bed at 2am not 10pm that night) and said we spent the whole week together so she needed some time to recharge which I didnt understand why that meant I had to leave. She kept giving reasons that made no sense so I packed the rest of my things, she walked me to the door and I left. 

This had happened a few times before where she would want to be away from me to ""recharge"" but she would still be hanging out with other people so I found that weird, just be in a different room, doesnt mean your partner should have to leave the house. It also happened when I had asked for changes to be made and she would do it for a day or two but then need ""time alone"" like she couldn't keep up.

I slowly stopped going around after that and pulled away as it seemed clear she didnt car about my feelings. 3 weeks later she started trying to get me to come around, promises of sex and to watch movies etc. I would take her out but would drop her home then leave back to my place and never stayed. Eventually I told her I couldn't handle the push pull anymore because she wasnt trying when I needed it and only when I pull back. She waited another week before telling me she had changed everything, going to the gym, stopped smoking weed or vape, wants to live together, cook dinner, buy a house basically all the things I had told her I want out of life. I told her words are just talk because she has said it before and its a little too late. I said I was proud of her making these changes for herself and she needs to prove she can keep it up.

A few days later she started a conversation of lengthy paragraphs explaining that it takes two to make things work and because we had been through so much together already we should be able to make this work and asking why I wasnt trying. I said I had tried for so long and she didn't meet me and I wasnt going to come for another round of the same old, I was happy to be here friend through all this and she fell silent and had ghosted me once more.

It took 1.5 week for me to start feeling the absence and I decided I was going to get clarity no matter what that looks like. So I called her work and when she answered I only gave her a time and location, she shakily said okay see you then. When I met with her she basically just wanted to use me cheating on her as the reason for everything she was doing which felt like downplaying her part in this. Whenever she would say something I agreed with from my side I said that is one of the reasons I broke up with you because I wasn't getting this from you. After a long chat in circles she had to go back to work and I left feeling like we didnt resolve the core issue but I did gain some clarity from it. Something that keeps ringing in my mind is she said her mother had told her not to date guys that hate themselves because they would hate you for loving them. I dont know why she put that out there.

From this whole experience I feel like I had no self worth from forgiving and just letting things go all those years ago. Then after feeling neglected for so long getting into a relationship that felt very much like the young version of what I once had, having my family and friends turned on me with no way to repair it and I have been feeling lost for a while now, not knowing which way is up and struggling to find myself through all this. I would appreciate other perspectives.

Chapter¬†1¬†

**Chapter¬†1**¬†

The¬†day¬†before¬†my¬†wedding,¬†I¬†dropped¬†my¬†best¬†man¬†off¬†at his¬†hotel¬†and¬†saw¬†my¬†fianc√©e,¬†Isabella,¬†checking¬†into¬†a¬†room¬†with¬†her¬†ex‚Äìboyfriend.¬†

Just¬†ten¬†minutes¬†earlier,¬†she¬†had¬†texted¬†me:¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll¬†be¬†waiting¬†for¬†you¬†tomorrow,¬†my¬†love.¬†Come¬†and¬†take¬†me¬†home.‚Äù¬†

I¬†swallowed my¬†rage¬†and¬†filmed¬†the¬†video¬†of¬†them¬†kissing¬†in¬†the¬†hallway.¬†

The¬†next¬†day,¬†at¬†our¬†wedding,¬†I¬†played¬†it¬†for¬†everyone¬†to¬†see.¬†

**1**¬†

The¬†moment¬†the¬†video¬†played,¬†the¬†reception¬†hall¬†erupted.¬†

Isabella‚Äôs¬†younger¬†brother¬†was¬†the¬†first¬†to¬†react,¬†pointing¬†at¬†the¬†event¬†staff¬†and¬†screaming.¬†

‚ÄúWhat¬†the¬†hell¬†are¬†you¬†people¬†doing?¬†Why¬†would¬†you¬†play¬†a¬†video¬†like¬†this¬†at¬†a¬†wedding?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHow¬†dare¬†you¬†embarrass¬†the¬†Thorne¬†family!¬†Is¬†your¬†company¬†trying¬†to¬†go¬†out¬†of¬†business?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs¬†your¬†manager?¬†Get¬†them¬†out¬†here‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

His¬†voice¬†trailed¬†off¬†as he,¬†along¬†with¬†every other¬†guest,¬†became¬†glued¬†to¬†the¬†screen.¬†

I¬†nodded,¬†satisfied.¬†

‚ÄúEveryone,‚Äù¬†I¬†announced,¬†‚Äúwelcome¬†to¬†my¬†breakup¬†party with¬†Isabella¬†Thorne.¬†From¬†this¬†day¬†forward,¬†we¬†are¬†finished.¬†Please,¬†eat,¬†drink,¬†and¬†enjoy.‚Äù¬†

Realizing¬†she¬†was¬†the¬†star¬†of¬†the¬†show,¬†Isabella¬†rushed¬†toward¬†me,¬†desperate¬†to¬†explain.¬†But¬†I¬†had¬†already¬†*dropped*¬†the¬†microphone¬†and¬†walked¬†out.¬†

The¬†second¬†I¬†stepped¬†outside¬†the¬†hotel,¬†my¬†father‚Äôs¬†call¬†came¬†through.¬†I¬†let¬†my¬†phone‚Äôs¬†Al¬†assistant¬†handle¬†it.¬†When¬†I‚Äôd¬†first¬†told¬†him¬†I¬†was¬†marrying Isabella,¬†he‚Äôd¬†been so¬†ecstatic¬†he¬†stayed drunk¬†for¬†three¬†days,¬†bragg-¬†ing¬†to¬†anyone¬†who¬†would¬†listen¬†about¬†how¬†his¬†brilliant¬†son¬†was¬†marrying¬†a¬†wealthy¬†heiress.¬†

He¬†would¬†be¬†the¬†last¬†person¬†*to*¬†accept¬†this¬†wedding¬†being¬†called¬†off.¬†

Back¬†at¬†my¬†apartment,¬†the¬†calls¬†from¬†my¬†father¬†were relentless.¬†Annoyed,¬†I¬†finally¬†just¬†pulled¬†the¬†SIM¬†card¬†out¬†of¬†my¬†phone.¬†I¬†tossed¬†my¬†wedding¬†suit¬†in¬†the¬†trash¬†and¬†found¬†the¬†nearest¬†bar.¬†

My¬†social media,¬†anything¬†that¬†connected¬†me¬†to¬†Isabella,¬†was¬†blowing¬†up¬†with¬†notifications.¬†But¬†I¬†had¬†a¬†new¬†phone¬†now.¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†see¬†their¬†chaos¬†even¬†if¬†I¬†wanted¬†to.¬†

The¬†bar¬†owner¬†saw me¬†and¬†strolled¬†over,¬†a friendly¬†grin¬†on¬†his¬†face.¬†

‚ÄúFlying¬†solo¬†tonight,¬†Leo?¬†Where‚Äôs¬†your fianc√©e?‚Äù¬†

Chapter¬†1¬†

I¬†glanced¬†over¬†my¬†shoulder,¬†a¬†wry¬†smile¬†on¬†my¬†face.¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll¬†be¬†here¬†soon.‚Äù¬†

A¬†second¬†later,¬†a¬†familiar¬†figure¬†appeared.¬†

14:07¬†

Isabella¬†was¬†frantically¬†pushing¬†her¬†way¬†through¬†the¬†crowd,¬†her eyes¬†glued¬†to¬†her¬†phone¬†as¬†she¬†scanned¬†the¬†

room.¬†

A¬†man¬†who¬†had¬†been¬†watching¬†me¬†from¬†a¬†distance a¬†moment¬†before¬†moved¬†toward¬†her.¬†She¬†fought¬†him¬†off,¬†shoving¬†him¬†away.¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†hear¬†what¬†he¬†said,¬†but¬†it¬†left¬†a¬†*look*¬†of¬†pure¬†resentment¬†*on*¬†her¬†face¬†as¬†she¬†push-¬†ed¬†him¬†aside¬†again¬†and¬†continued¬†her¬†search.¬†

The¬†man¬†watched¬†her¬†go,¬†his¬†posture¬†radiating¬†a¬†deep,¬†lonely pain.¬†The¬†bar‚Äôs¬†flashing¬†lights¬†obscured¬†his¬†features,¬†but¬†there¬†was¬†something¬†unsettlingly¬†familiar¬†about¬†him.¬†I¬†assumed¬†he¬†was¬†a¬†friend¬†of¬†Isabella‚Äôs¬†who¬†had¬†spotted¬†me¬†and¬†tipped¬†her¬†off.¬†Yet,¬†racking¬†my¬†brain,¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†place¬†him.¬†

It¬†was¬†the¬†bar¬†owner¬†who¬†broke¬†my¬†train¬†of¬†thought.¬†

‚ÄúLeo,¬†your¬†fianc√©e¬†is¬†calling¬†my¬†phone¬†now.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYour¬†phone‚Äôs¬†on,¬†isn‚Äôt¬†it?¬†What‚Äôs¬†going¬†on?¬†You¬†two¬†have¬†a¬†fight?‚Äù¬†

I¬†looked¬†up,¬†and¬†he,¬†thinking¬†I¬†wanted¬†to¬†answer,¬†accepted¬†the¬†call.¬†He¬†even helpfully¬†turned¬†it¬†on¬†speaker.¬†

Isabella‚Äôs¬†voice,¬†frantic and¬†loud,¬†came¬†through¬†the¬†phone.¬†‚ÄúLeo,¬†honey,¬†I¬†know¬†you‚Äôre¬†at¬†a¬†bar.¬†Please¬†just tell¬†me¬†where¬†you¬†are.¬†Give¬†me¬†a¬†chance¬†to¬†explain.‚Äù¬†

I¬†hung¬†up.¬†The¬†owner¬†stared¬†at¬†me,¬†bewildered.¬†

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt¬†you¬†*going*¬†to¬†find¬†her?¬†Aren‚Äôt¬†you worried¬†about¬†her¬†being¬†out¬†alone?‚Äù¬†

I¬†glanced¬†back¬†at¬†the¬†*spot*¬†where¬†the¬†mysterious¬†man¬†had¬†been.¬†He¬†had¬†already¬†vanished¬†back¬†into¬†the¬†cro-¬†

1. wd.¬†

‚ÄòShe‚Äôs¬†not¬†my¬†fianc√©e¬†anymore,‚Äù¬†I¬†murmured,¬†my¬†voice¬†hollow.¬†‚ÄúShe¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†need¬†me.‚Äò¬†

**3**¬†

It¬†was¬†past¬†two¬†in¬†the¬†morning when¬†I¬†finally¬†stumbled¬†home.¬†

I¬†looked¬†up¬†and¬†saw¬†her,¬†Isabella,¬†huddled¬†by¬†my¬†front¬†door.¬†It¬†was¬†always¬†her¬†move¬†after¬†she‚Äôd¬†done¬†somet-¬†hing¬†wrong.¬†

‚ÄúLeo,¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†find¬†you¬†at¬†the¬†bar,¬†and¬†your¬†phone¬†was¬†off.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve¬†had¬†so¬†much¬†to¬†drink.¬†You¬†can¬†barely¬†stand.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCome¬†on,¬†let‚Äôs¬†get¬†you¬†inside.‚Äù¬†

*2/7*¬†

14:07¬†

Chapter¬†1¬†

She¬†greeted¬†me¬†with¬†a¬†bright,¬†relieved¬†smile,¬†fussing¬†over¬†me¬†as¬†if¬†nothing¬†had¬†happened.¬†

I¬†shoved¬†her¬†away.¬†‚ÄúGet¬†off¬†me.¬†Don‚Äôt¬†touch¬†me!‚Äù¬†

14:07¬†

She¬†froze,¬†her¬†eyes¬†filled¬†with¬†a¬†wounded¬†look.¬†‚ÄúHoney,¬†it¬†was¬†the¬†wedding¬†company.¬†They¬†were¬†trying¬†to¬†mess¬†with¬†us.¬†The¬†video¬†was¬†a¬†deepfake.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve¬†already¬†called¬†my¬†lawyer.¬†I‚Äôll¬†find¬†the¬†proof,¬†I¬†promise‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI¬†filmed¬†it.‚Äù¬†

My¬†voice¬†was¬†cold¬†as I¬†looked¬†at her.¬†‚ÄúYou¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†even¬†wait¬†to¬†get into¬†*the*¬†room.¬†You¬†were¬†so¬†into¬†tha¬†kiss,¬†it‚Äôs¬†no¬†surprise¬†you¬†didn‚Äôt¬†see¬†me¬†standing¬†right¬†there.‚Äù¬†

The¬†color drained¬†from¬†her¬†face.¬†She¬†stood¬†rooted¬†to¬†the¬†spot,.¬†lost.¬†

The¬†alcohol¬†in¬†my stomach¬†churned.¬†I¬†pushed¬†past¬†her,¬†ran¬†to¬†the¬†bathroom,¬†and¬†collapsed¬†over¬†the¬†toilet¬†heaving¬†until¬†tears¬†streamed¬†from¬†my¬†eyes.¬†

Isabella¬†followed¬†me,¬†silently¬†tending¬†to¬†me.¬†She¬†handed me¬†tissues,¬†found¬†the¬†hangover¬†pills,¬†and¬†went¬†to¬†the¬†kitchen¬†to¬†cook¬†me¬†noodles.¬†

She¬†didn‚Äôt¬†say¬†a¬†word.¬†

But¬†every¬†second, the¬†image¬†of¬†her¬†and¬†her¬†ex,¬†desperate¬†for¬†each¬†other¬†outside¬†that¬†hotel¬†room,¬†played¬†on¬†a¬†oop¬†in¬†my¬†head.¬†Seeing¬†her¬†now,¬†so¬†full¬†of¬†care¬†and¬†concern,¬†felt surreal¬†and¬†absurd.¬†

‚ÄòIsabella,¬†I¬†don‚Äôt¬†want¬†to¬†see¬†you¬†again.¬†Get¬†out¬†of¬†my¬†apartment.‚Äù¬†

Suddenly,¬†there¬†was¬†a¬†crash¬†from¬†the¬†kitchen‚Äìthe¬†sound¬†of¬†a¬†bowl¬†shattering.¬†

She¬†was¬†silent¬†for¬†a¬†long¬†moment.¬†Then,¬†she¬†brought¬†out¬†the¬†noodles¬†and¬†the¬†pills,¬†placed¬†them¬†on¬†the¬†table¬†

n¬†front of¬†*me*,¬†and¬†quietly¬†cleaned¬†up¬†the¬†broken¬†porcelain.¬†

Leo,¬†just‚Ä¶¬†take¬†some¬†time¬†*to¬†cool*¬†off.¬†I‚Äôll¬†come¬†back¬†in¬†a¬†few¬†days,¬†and we¬†can¬†talk.‚Äù¬†

was¬†slumped¬†on¬†the¬†sofa,¬†my¬†hand¬†covering¬†my¬†eyes.¬†

Get¬†out.‚Äù¬†

didn‚Äôt¬†touch¬†the¬†food.¬†I¬†spent¬†the¬†night¬†on¬†the¬†sofa,¬†wrapped¬†in¬†my¬†own¬†arms.¬†

Early¬†the¬†next¬†morning,¬†a¬†loud¬†banging¬†rattled¬†the front¬†door.¬†

opened¬†it,¬†and¬†my¬†father¬†stormed¬†in,¬†nearly¬†knocking¬†me¬†over.¬†

‚ÄòLeo!¬†Have¬†you¬†lost¬†your¬†mind?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄòIsabella¬†is¬†from¬†a¬†wealthy¬†family!¬†Of¬†course¬†she‚Äôs¬†had¬†boyfriends!¬†Once¬†you¬†were¬†married,¬†you¬†would¬†have¬†had¬†everything!¬†You‚Äôre¬†going¬†to¬†throw¬†all¬†that¬†away¬†over¬†one¬†little thing?‚Äù¬†

Chapter¬†1¬†

‚ÄúAll¬†our friends¬†and¬†family¬†were¬†there!¬†How¬†could¬†you¬†humiliate¬†me¬†like¬†that?‚Äù¬†

1407¬†W¬†

My¬†head¬†was¬†pounding.¬†‚ÄúDad,‚Äù¬†I¬†said¬†weakly,¬†‚Äúdid¬†you¬†not¬†see¬†the¬†video?¬†She¬†was¬†with¬†her¬†ex,¬†the¬†day¬†before¬†

our¬†wedding‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

He¬†waved¬†his¬†hand¬†dismissively.¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt¬†talk¬†to¬†me¬†about¬†that!¬†She‚Äôs a¬†fourth‚Äìgeneration¬†heiress!¬†Men¬†are¬†lining¬†up¬†to¬†marry¬†her.¬†This¬†only¬†happened¬†because¬†you¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†keep¬†her¬†satisfied!¬†If¬†you¬†were¬†man¬†enough¬†to¬†keep¬†her¬†focused¬†on¬†you,¬†this¬†never¬†would¬†have¬†happened.¬†You¬†were¬†about¬†to¬†marry¬†up,¬†to¬†enter¬†a¬†whole¬†new¬†world,¬†and¬†you¬†just¬†walk¬†away?¬†You‚Äôre¬†thirty¬†years¬†old,¬†Leo!¬†Where¬†are¬†*you¬†going*¬†to¬†find¬†another¬†woman¬†who¬†can¬†do¬†more¬†for¬†you¬†than¬†Isabella?‚Äù¬†

Hearing¬†those¬†words¬†come¬†from¬†him¬†was¬†no¬†surprise.¬†His¬†greed¬†knew¬†no¬†bounds,¬†especially¬†when¬†it¬†came¬†to¬†

rich¬†women.¬†

But¬†I¬†had¬†my¬†limits.¬†

‚ÄúDad,¬†if¬†you¬†love¬†her¬†so¬†much,¬†why¬†don‚Äôt¬†you¬†ask¬†her¬†to¬†adopt¬†you?‚Äù¬†

He¬†sputtered¬†with¬†rage,¬†his¬†hand¬†flying¬†up¬†to¬†slap¬†me.¬†I‚Äôd¬†been¬†drinking¬†all¬†night¬†on¬†an¬†empty¬†stomach,¬†and¬†

the¬†stress¬†sent¬†a¬†sharp,¬†cramping¬†pain¬†through¬†my¬†gut.¬†I¬†shoved¬†him¬†aside¬†and¬†ran¬†for¬†the¬†bathroom¬†again.¬†

Even¬†then,¬†he¬†didn‚Äôt¬†stop¬†yelling,¬†telling¬†me¬†I¬†was¬†inflexible,¬†that¬†my¬†lifestyle was¬†unhealthy.¬†But¬†every¬†senten.¬†

ce¬†somehow¬†circled¬†back¬†to¬†Isabella.¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs¬†beautiful,¬†she‚Äôs¬†sophisticated,¬†and¬†her¬†family¬†is¬†top‚Äìtier!¬†You couldn‚Äôt¬†hold¬†on¬†to¬†her,¬†and¬†now¬†she‚Äôll¬†fin¬†

someone¬†better¬†looking,¬†more¬†successful,¬†and¬†more¬†open‚Äìminded¬†than¬†you!¬†You‚Äôll¬†be¬†left¬†with¬†nothing!‚Äù¬†

His¬†words¬†echoed¬†down¬†the¬†hall¬†and¬†drilled¬†into¬†my¬†ears.¬†I¬†thought¬†of the¬†heartbroken¬†man¬†at¬†the¬†bar¬†last¬†

night.¬†The¬†delayed¬†realization¬†hit¬†me like¬†a¬†sledgehammer,¬†pounding¬†against¬†my¬†chest.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre¬†a¬†grown¬†man,¬†and¬†*you*¬†can‚Äôt¬†even¬†clean¬†up¬†after¬†yourself!¬†What¬†are¬†these¬†drops¬†of¬†blood¬†on¬†the¬†floor?¬†

‚ÄúOnly¬†Isabella¬†would¬†put¬†up¬†with¬†you.¬†Any¬†other¬†woman¬†would have¬†burned¬†this¬†place¬†to¬†the¬†ground¬†by¬†now.‚Äù¬†

I¬†slammed¬†the¬†bathroom¬†door¬†shut¬†and¬†crawled into¬†bed,¬†pulling¬†the¬†covers¬†over¬†my¬†head.¬†I¬†curled¬†into¬†a¬†

ball,¬†cocooned¬†in¬†the¬†darkness,¬†and¬†finally¬†let myself¬†sob.¬†

**5**¬†

My¬†relationship¬†with¬†Isabella¬†didn‚Äôt¬†start¬†the¬†way¬†my¬†father¬†thought‚Äìme¬†climbing¬†the¬†social¬†ladder,¬†her¬†being¬†a¬†convenient,¬†docile¬†rich¬†girl.¬†

We¬†had¬†been¬†together¬†for¬†ten¬†years.¬†

We¬†fell¬†in¬†love¬†during¬†a¬†time¬†when¬†my¬†father‚Äôs¬†control over¬†my¬†life¬†was¬†at¬†its¬†most¬†suffocating.¬†In¬†our¬†tenth¬†year¬†together,¬†through¬†my¬†own¬†hard¬†work,¬†I¬†had¬†finally¬†bought¬†an¬†apartment¬†and¬†a¬†car¬†in¬†the¬†city¬†where¬†her¬†family¬†lived.¬†

I¬†had¬†teased¬†her,¬†‚ÄúApartment¬†and¬†car¬†are¬†paid¬†in¬†full.¬†I‚Äôve¬†saved¬†for¬†the¬†wedding,¬†and¬†I¬†even¬†bought¬†you¬†your¬†favorite¬†style¬†of¬†ring.¬†How¬†much¬†longer¬†do¬†I¬†have¬†to¬†wait¬†before¬†you‚Äôll¬†marry¬†me?‚Äù¬†

14:07¬†

14.08¬†

Chapter¬†1¬†

She¬†had¬†cupped¬†my¬†face¬†in¬†her¬†hands¬†and¬†kissed¬†me,¬†her¬†love¬†enveloping¬†me.¬†When¬†she¬†pulled¬†back,¬†her¬†eyes¬†were¬†shining.¬†

‚ÄúThis¬†year.¬†Let‚Äôs¬†get¬†married¬†this¬†year.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLeo,¬†do¬†you¬†still¬†want¬†to¬†marry¬†me?‚Äù¬†

I¬†didn‚Äôt.¬†

I¬†should¬†have¬†said¬†no¬†right¬†then.¬†

Isabella,¬†you¬†said¬†I¬†was¬†your¬†present¬†and¬†your¬†future.¬†I¬†was¬†the¬†one¬†who¬†healed¬†*your*¬†past,¬†the¬†one¬†who¬†brou-¬†ght¬†you¬†peace.¬†I¬†was¬†the¬†one¬†you¬†were¬†supposed¬†to¬†walk¬†down¬†the¬†aisle¬†with.¬†

So¬†why?¬†Why,¬†when¬†I¬†was¬†closer¬†to¬†happiness¬†than¬†I¬†had¬†ever¬†been,¬†did¬†you¬†have¬†to¬†*go*¬†back¬†*to*¬†him?¬†

My¬†father¬†harassed¬†me¬†for¬†days,¬†a¬†cycle¬†of¬†threats¬†and¬†pleading,¬†all¬†aimed¬†at¬†getting¬†me¬†to¬†reconcile¬†with¬†Isabella.¬†When¬†he¬†realized¬†I¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†going¬†to¬†budge,¬†he¬†slammed¬†the¬†door¬†and¬†left¬†in¬†a¬†huff.¬†

I¬†locked¬†myself¬†in¬†my¬†apartment.¬†No¬†one¬†called.¬†My¬†phone¬†was¬†off.¬†I¬†heard¬†nothing.¬†I¬†lay¬†on¬†my bed¬†like¬†a¬†corpse,¬†utterly¬†lifeless.¬†

On¬†Monday,¬†I¬†went¬†back¬†to¬†the¬†office.¬†

My¬†colleagues¬†immediately¬†started¬†congratulating¬†me.¬†

The¬†wedding¬†didn‚Äôt¬†happen.¬†Sorry,‚Äù¬†I¬†said¬†flatly.¬†

Their¬†faces¬†shifted¬†from¬†cheerful¬†to¬†awkward.¬†‚ÄúOh.¬†That‚Äôs‚Ä¶¬†sudden.¬†I‚Äôm¬†so¬†sorry,¬†I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†mean¬†to‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄòLet¬†me¬†buy¬†*you*¬†a¬†coffee,¬†man,¬†I‚Äôm¬†really sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

cut¬†them¬†off with¬†a¬†weak¬†smile.¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt¬†worry¬†about¬†it.¬†It‚Äôs¬†over.‚Äù¬†

The¬†busy¬†morning¬†was¬†a¬†welcome¬†distraction.¬†I¬†went¬†to¬†the¬†breakroom¬†to¬†get¬†some¬†water¬†and¬†overheard¬†a¬†

few¬†people¬†whispering.¬†

‚ÄúWhy¬†didn‚Äôt¬†Leo¬†get¬†married?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHis¬†fianc√©e¬†is¬†gorgeous¬†and¬†comes¬†from¬†a¬†great¬†family.¬†You¬†think¬†she¬†got¬†cold¬†feet?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo¬†way.¬†She¬†was¬†crazy¬†about¬†him.¬†She¬†used¬†to¬†bring¬†him¬†different¬†kinds¬†of¬†homemade¬†soup¬†every¬†week¬†to¬†help¬†his¬†stomach¬†problems.¬†When¬†he¬†was¬†hospitalized¬†for¬†that¬†ulcer,¬†she¬†never¬†left¬†his¬†side.¬†She¬†even¬†drove¬†him¬†to¬†and¬†from¬†work¬†for¬†a¬†while¬†after¬†he¬†was¬†discharged.¬†She¬†was¬†completely¬†devoted¬†to¬†him.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThen¬†what¬†could¬†it be?¬†You¬†don‚Äôt¬†think¬†Leo¬†was¬†cheating¬†on¬†her,¬†do¬†you?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGet¬†out¬†of¬†here!¬†We‚Äôve¬†worked¬†with¬†him¬†for¬†years.¬†He‚Äôs¬†capable,¬†responsible,¬†has¬†a¬†great¬†sense¬†of¬†humor¬†but¬†always¬†knows¬†the¬†line.¬†He‚Äôs¬†a¬†solid¬†guy.‚Äù¬†

Chapter¬†1¬†

I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†stay¬†to¬†hear¬†the¬†rest.¬†I¬†bought¬†a¬†coffee¬†from¬†the¬†vending¬†machine¬†and¬†went¬†back¬†to¬†my¬†desk.¬†

As¬†soon¬†as¬†I¬†sat¬†down,¬†my¬†father¬†called.¬†I¬†ignored¬†it,¬†but¬†then¬†the¬†texts¬†started.¬†

‚ÄúHow¬†could¬†you¬†block¬†Isabella?¬†Are¬†you¬†a¬†child?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt¬†you¬†two¬†just¬†sit¬†down¬†and talk¬†this¬†out¬†like¬†adults?**‚Äù**¬†

I¬†read¬†the¬†messages¬†with¬†a¬†detached¬†numbness.¬†I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†know¬†how¬†*to*¬†respond.¬†My¬†entire¬†being¬†felt¬†hollow.¬†By¬†the¬†time¬†I¬†snapped¬†out¬†of¬†**it,**¬†my¬†father‚Äôs¬†number¬†was¬†in¬†my¬†block¬†list.¬†

A¬†thunderstorm¬†raged¬†outside,¬†the¬†wind¬†howling.¬†Flashes¬†of¬†lightning¬†illuminated¬†the¬†faces¬†of¬†my¬†colleagues¬†as¬†they¬†rushed¬†to¬†get¬†home.¬†I¬†waited¬†until¬†the¬†office¬†was¬†empty¬†before¬†heading¬†down.¬†

I¬†opened¬†my¬†bag¬†and¬†remembered:¬†I¬†never¬†carried¬†an¬†umbrella.¬†For¬†ten¬†years,¬†Isabella¬†had¬†always¬†been¬†the¬†one to¬†remind¬†me.¬†Before¬†I¬†left,¬†she¬†would¬†give¬†me¬†a¬†playful,¬†insistent¬†look¬†until¬†I¬†finally¬†grabbed¬†it.¬†

I¬†had¬†gotten¬†so¬†used¬†to¬†following¬†her¬†lead.¬†I¬†trusted¬†her¬†unconditionally.¬†

That¬†kind¬†of¬†blind¬†trust¬†is¬†a¬†terrifying¬†thing.¬†

I¬†held¬†my¬†briefcase¬†over my head¬†and¬†dashed¬†into¬†the¬†parking garage,¬†only¬†to¬†find¬†my car¬†wouldn‚Äôt¬†start.¬†I¬†slammed¬†my¬†fist¬†on¬†the¬†steering¬†wheel¬†in¬†frustration.¬†It¬†had¬†been¬†working¬†fine.¬†

In¬†the¬†end,¬†I¬†had¬†no¬†choice but¬†to¬†brave¬†the¬†storm¬†and¬†head¬†for¬†the¬†subway.¬†

The¬†moment¬†I¬†stepped¬†out¬†of the¬†garage,¬†I¬†saw¬†her.¬†Isabella,¬†standing¬†in¬†the¬†pouring¬†rain.¬†

She¬†saw¬†me¬†and¬†ran¬†over,¬†her¬†voice¬†filled¬†with¬†worry.¬†‚ÄúLeo,¬†you‚Äôre¬†getting¬†soaked!¬†Let‚Äôs¬†just¬†go¬†home¬†and¬†we¬†

can¬†talk‚Ä¶*‚Äù*¬†

‚ÄòLet¬†go¬†of¬†me!‚Äù¬†

ripped¬†my¬†arm¬†from¬†her¬†grasp¬†and stormed¬†off¬†into the¬†downpour.¬†She¬†ran¬†after¬†me,¬†calling¬†my¬†name,¬†trying¬†to¬†shield¬†me¬†from¬†the¬†rain¬†with¬†her¬†small hands.¬†

‚ÄòLeo,¬†I¬†drove¬†here!¬†Please,¬†let¬†me¬†give¬†you¬†a¬†ride!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄòYou¬†have¬†stomach¬†problems!¬†You‚Äôll¬†get¬†sick¬†if¬†you¬†catch¬†a¬†cold!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄòIf¬†you¬†won‚Äôt¬†get¬†in¬†the¬†car,¬†at¬†least¬†take¬†my¬†umbrella!¬†I‚Äôll¬†worry¬†about¬†you‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLeave¬†me¬†alone!¬†Stop¬†following¬†me!‚Äù¬†

‚Äù¬†

I¬†stopped¬†dead¬†in¬†my¬†tracks¬†and¬†screamed¬†at¬†her,¬†all¬†my¬†pent‚Äìup¬†frustration¬†and¬†pain¬†exploding¬†out¬†of¬†me.¬†

‚ÄúJust¬†get¬†away¬†from¬†me!¬†GO!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI¬†never¬†want¬†to¬†see¬†you¬†again!¬†I¬†don‚Äôt¬†want¬†to¬†hear¬†another¬†word¬†from¬†you!¬†Do¬†you¬†hear¬†me?‚Äù¬†

I¬†was¬†shaking,¬†my¬†face¬†a¬†mess¬†of¬†rain¬†and¬†tears.¬†My¬†throat¬†was¬†raw,¬†as¬†if¬†I¬†had¬†screamed¬†myself¬†bloody.¬†

Why?¬†The¬†day¬†had¬†been¬†so¬†normal.¬†I¬†had¬†closed¬†a¬†deal¬†with¬†a¬†client,¬†I¬†had¬†eaten¬†properly.¬†I¬†had¬†even¬†decided¬†to¬†finally¬†schedule¬†a¬†check‚Äìup¬†for my¬†long‚Äìneglected stomach¬†issues.¬†I¬†thought¬†I¬†was¬†moving¬†on.¬†

Why¬†did¬†the¬†sight¬†of¬†her¬†make¬†me¬†fall¬†apart¬†all¬†over¬†again?¬†

The¬†only¬†umbrella¬†we¬†had¬†was¬†knocked¬†from¬†my¬†hand,¬†snatched¬†by¬†the¬†wind and¬†*sent*¬†tumbling¬†down¬†the¬†street.¬†Isabella‚Äôs¬†elegant¬†dress¬†was¬†ruined,¬†plastered¬†to¬†her¬†skin¬†by¬†the¬†rain.¬†We¬†stood¬†*there*,¬†two¬†pathetic¬†

drenched¬†figures.¬†

Despite¬†my¬†furious¬†rejection,¬†she¬†stood¬†as¬†still¬†as¬†a¬†statue,¬†just¬†staring¬†at¬†me.¬†Her¬†lips¬†*moved*,¬†soundlessly¬†

orming¬†my¬†name.¬†

Seeing¬†her¬†so¬†broken¬†and¬†lost¬†brought¬†me¬†no¬†relief.¬†It¬†only¬†made¬†the¬†weight¬†on¬†my¬†chest¬†heavier.¬†

A¬†few¬†passersby¬†were¬†staring.¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†stand¬†it¬†any¬†longer.¬†I¬†wiped¬†the¬†water¬†from¬†my¬†face¬†and¬†walked¬†away,¬†leaving¬†her¬†standing¬†alone¬†in¬†the¬†storm.¬†

Back¬†home,¬†after¬†a¬†hot shower,¬†I¬†could already¬†feel¬†a¬†cold coming¬†on,¬†and¬†a¬†dull¬†ache¬†in¬†my¬†stomach.¬†I¬†tool¬†some¬†medicine¬†and¬†was¬†about¬†to¬†lie¬†down¬†when¬†my¬†phone¬†lit¬†up¬†with¬†a¬†call¬†from¬†an¬†unknown¬†number.¬†

Chapter¬†1¬†

**Chapter¬†1**¬†

The¬†day¬†before¬†my¬†wedding,¬†I¬†dropped¬†my¬†best¬†man¬†off¬†at his¬†hotel¬†and¬†saw¬†my¬†fianc√©e,¬†Isabella,¬†checking¬†into¬†a¬†room¬†with¬†her¬†ex‚Äìboyfriend.¬†

Just¬†ten¬†minutes¬†earlier,¬†she¬†had¬†texted¬†me:¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll¬†be¬†waiting¬†for¬†you¬†tomorrow,¬†my¬†love.¬†Come¬†and¬†take¬†me¬†home.‚Äù¬†

I¬†swallowed my¬†rage¬†and¬†filmed¬†the¬†video¬†of¬†them¬†kissing¬†in¬†the¬†hallway.¬†

The¬†next¬†day,¬†at¬†our¬†wedding,¬†I¬†played¬†it¬†for¬†everyone¬†to¬†see.¬†

**1**¬†

The¬†moment¬†the¬†video¬†played,¬†the¬†reception¬†hall¬†erupted.¬†

Isabella‚Äôs¬†younger¬†brother¬†was¬†the¬†first¬†to¬†react,¬†pointing¬†at¬†the¬†event¬†staff¬†and¬†screaming.¬†

‚ÄúWhat¬†the¬†hell¬†are¬†you¬†people¬†doing?¬†Why¬†would¬†you¬†play¬†a¬†video¬†like¬†this¬†at¬†a¬†wedding?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHow¬†dare¬†you¬†embarrass¬†the¬†Thorne¬†family!¬†Is¬†your¬†company¬†trying¬†to¬†go¬†out¬†of¬†business?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs¬†your¬†manager?¬†Get¬†them¬†out¬†here‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

His¬†voice¬†trailed¬†off¬†as he,¬†along¬†with¬†every other¬†guest,¬†became¬†glued¬†to¬†the¬†screen.¬†

I¬†nodded,¬†satisfied.¬†

‚ÄúEveryone,‚Äù¬†I¬†announced,¬†‚Äúwelcome¬†to¬†my¬†breakup¬†party with¬†Isabella¬†Thorne.¬†From¬†this¬†day¬†forward,¬†we¬†are¬†finished.¬†Please,¬†eat,¬†drink,¬†and¬†enjoy.‚Äù¬†

Realizing¬†she¬†was¬†the¬†star¬†of¬†the¬†show,¬†Isabella¬†rushed¬†toward¬†me,¬†desperate¬†to¬†explain.¬†But¬†I¬†had¬†already¬†*dropped*¬†the¬†microphone¬†and¬†walked¬†out.¬†

The¬†second¬†I¬†stepped¬†outside¬†the¬†hotel,¬†my¬†father‚Äôs¬†call¬†came¬†through.¬†I¬†let¬†my¬†phone‚Äôs¬†Al¬†assistant¬†handle¬†it.¬†When¬†I‚Äôd¬†first¬†told¬†him¬†I¬†was¬†marrying Isabella,¬†he‚Äôd¬†been so¬†ecstatic¬†he¬†stayed drunk¬†for¬†three¬†days,¬†bragg-¬†ing¬†to¬†anyone¬†who¬†would¬†listen¬†about¬†how¬†his¬†brilliant¬†son¬†was¬†marrying¬†a¬†wealthy¬†heiress.¬†

He¬†would¬†be¬†the¬†last¬†person¬†*to*¬†accept¬†this¬†wedding¬†being¬†called¬†off.¬†

Back¬†at¬†my¬†apartment,¬†the¬†calls¬†from¬†my¬†father¬†were relentless.¬†Annoyed,¬†I¬†finally¬†just¬†pulled¬†the¬†SIM¬†card¬†out¬†of¬†my¬†phone.¬†I¬†tossed¬†my¬†wedding¬†suit¬†in¬†the¬†trash¬†and¬†found¬†the¬†nearest¬†bar.¬†

My¬†social media,¬†anything¬†that¬†connected¬†me¬†to¬†Isabella,¬†was¬†blowing¬†up¬†with¬†notifications.¬†But¬†I¬†had¬†a¬†new¬†phone¬†now.¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†see¬†their¬†chaos¬†even¬†if¬†I¬†wanted¬†to.¬†

The¬†bar¬†owner¬†saw me¬†and¬†strolled¬†over,¬†a friendly¬†grin¬†on¬†his¬†face.¬†

‚ÄúFlying¬†solo¬†tonight,¬†Leo?¬†Where‚Äôs¬†your fianc√©e?‚Äù¬†

Chapter¬†1¬†

I¬†glanced¬†over¬†my¬†shoulder,¬†a¬†wry¬†smile¬†on¬†my¬†face.¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll¬†be¬†here¬†soon.‚Äù¬†

A¬†second¬†later,¬†a¬†familiar¬†figure¬†appeared.¬†

14:07¬†

Isabella¬†was¬†frantically¬†pushing¬†her¬†way¬†through¬†the¬†crowd,¬†her eyes¬†glued¬†to¬†her¬†phone¬†as¬†she¬†scanned¬†the¬†

room.¬†

A¬†man¬†who¬†had¬†been¬†watching¬†me¬†from¬†a¬†distance a¬†moment¬†before¬†moved¬†toward¬†her.¬†She¬†fought¬†him¬†off,¬†shoving¬†him¬†away.¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†hear¬†what¬†he¬†said,¬†but¬†it¬†left¬†a¬†*look*¬†of¬†pure¬†resentment¬†*on*¬†her¬†face¬†as¬†she¬†push-¬†ed¬†him¬†aside¬†again¬†and¬†continued¬†her¬†search.¬†

The¬†man¬†watched¬†her¬†go,¬†his¬†posture¬†radiating¬†a¬†deep,¬†lonely pain.¬†The¬†bar‚Äôs¬†flashing¬†lights¬†obscured¬†his¬†features,¬†but¬†there¬†was¬†something¬†unsettlingly¬†familiar¬†about¬†him.¬†I¬†assumed¬†he¬†was¬†a¬†friend¬†of¬†Isabella‚Äôs¬†who¬†had¬†spotted¬†me¬†and¬†tipped¬†her¬†off.¬†Yet,¬†racking¬†my¬†brain,¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†place¬†him.¬†

It¬†was¬†the¬†bar¬†owner¬†who¬†broke¬†my¬†train¬†of¬†thought.¬†

‚ÄúLeo,¬†your¬†fianc√©e¬†is¬†calling¬†my¬†phone¬†now.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYour¬†phone‚Äôs¬†on,¬†isn‚Äôt¬†it?¬†What‚Äôs¬†going¬†on?¬†You¬†two¬†have¬†a¬†fight?‚Äù¬†

I¬†looked¬†up,¬†and¬†he,¬†thinking¬†I¬†wanted¬†to¬†answer,¬†accepted¬†the¬†call.¬†He¬†even helpfully¬†turned¬†it¬†on¬†speaker.¬†

Isabella‚Äôs¬†voice,¬†frantic and¬†loud,¬†came¬†through¬†the¬†phone.¬†‚ÄúLeo,¬†honey,¬†I¬†know¬†you‚Äôre¬†at¬†a¬†bar.¬†Please¬†just tell¬†me¬†where¬†you¬†are.¬†Give¬†me¬†a¬†chance¬†to¬†explain.‚Äù¬†

I¬†hung¬†up.¬†The¬†owner¬†stared¬†at¬†me,¬†bewildered.¬†

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt¬†you¬†*going*¬†to¬†find¬†her?¬†Aren‚Äôt¬†you worried¬†about¬†her¬†being¬†out¬†alone?‚Äù¬†

I¬†glanced¬†back¬†at¬†the¬†*spot*¬†where¬†the¬†mysterious¬†man¬†had¬†been.¬†He¬†had¬†already¬†vanished¬†back¬†into¬†the¬†cro-¬†

1. wd.¬†

‚ÄòShe‚Äôs¬†not¬†my¬†fianc√©e¬†anymore,‚Äù¬†I¬†murmured,¬†my¬†voice¬†hollow.¬†‚ÄúShe¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†need¬†me.‚Äò¬†

**3**¬†

It¬†was¬†past¬†two¬†in¬†the¬†morning when¬†I¬†finally¬†stumbled¬†home.¬†

I¬†looked¬†up¬†and¬†saw¬†her,¬†Isabella,¬†huddled¬†by¬†my¬†front¬†door.¬†It¬†was¬†always¬†her¬†move¬†after¬†she‚Äôd¬†done¬†somet-¬†hing¬†wrong.¬†

‚ÄúLeo,¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†find¬†you¬†at¬†the¬†bar,¬†and¬†your¬†phone¬†was¬†off.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve¬†had¬†so¬†much¬†to¬†drink.¬†You¬†can¬†barely¬†stand.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCome¬†on,¬†let‚Äôs¬†get¬†you¬†inside.‚Äù¬†

Chapter¬†1¬†

She¬†greeted¬†me¬†with¬†a¬†bright,¬†relieved¬†smile,¬†fussing¬†over¬†me¬†as¬†if¬†nothing¬†had¬†happened.¬†

I¬†shoved¬†her¬†away.¬†‚ÄúGet¬†off¬†me.¬†Don‚Äôt¬†touch¬†me!‚Äù¬†

14:07¬†

She¬†froze,¬†her¬†eyes¬†filled¬†with¬†a¬†wounded¬†look.¬†‚ÄúHoney,¬†it¬†was¬†the¬†wedding¬†company.¬†They¬†were¬†trying¬†to¬†mess¬†with¬†us.¬†The¬†video¬†was¬†a¬†deepfake.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve¬†already¬†called¬†my¬†lawyer.¬†I‚Äôll¬†find¬†the¬†proof,¬†I¬†promise‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI¬†filmed¬†it.‚Äù¬†

My¬†voice¬†was¬†cold¬†as I¬†looked¬†at her.¬†‚ÄúYou¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†even¬†wait¬†to¬†get into¬†*the*¬†room.¬†You¬†were¬†so¬†into¬†tha¬†kiss,¬†it‚Äôs¬†no¬†surprise¬†you¬†didn‚Äôt¬†see¬†me¬†standing¬†right¬†there.‚Äù¬†

The¬†color drained¬†from¬†her¬†face.¬†She¬†stood¬†rooted¬†to¬†the¬†spot,.¬†lost.¬†

The¬†alcohol¬†in¬†my stomach¬†churned.¬†I¬†pushed¬†past¬†her,¬†ran¬†to¬†the¬†bathroom,¬†and¬†collapsed¬†over¬†the¬†toilet¬†heaving¬†until¬†tears¬†streamed¬†from¬†my¬†eyes.¬†

Isabella¬†followed¬†me,¬†silently¬†tending¬†to¬†me.¬†She¬†handed me¬†tissues,¬†found¬†the¬†hangover¬†pills,¬†and¬†went¬†to¬†the¬†kitchen¬†to¬†cook¬†me¬†noodles.¬†

She¬†didn‚Äôt¬†say¬†a¬†word.¬†

But¬†every¬†second, the¬†image¬†of¬†her¬†and¬†her¬†ex,¬†desperate¬†for¬†each¬†other¬†outside¬†that¬†hotel¬†room,¬†played¬†on¬†a¬†oop¬†in¬†my¬†head.¬†Seeing¬†her¬†now,¬†so¬†full¬†of¬†care¬†and¬†concern,¬†felt surreal¬†and¬†absurd.¬†

‚ÄòIsabella,¬†I¬†don‚Äôt¬†want¬†to¬†see¬†you¬†again.¬†Get¬†out¬†of¬†my¬†apartment.‚Äù¬†

Suddenly,¬†there¬†was¬†a¬†crash¬†from¬†the¬†kitchen‚Äìthe¬†sound¬†of¬†a¬†bowl¬†shattering.¬†

She¬†was¬†silent¬†for¬†a¬†long¬†moment.¬†Then,¬†she¬†brought¬†out¬†the¬†noodles¬†and¬†the¬†pills,¬†placed¬†them¬†on¬†the¬†table¬†

n¬†front of¬†*me*,¬†and¬†quietly¬†cleaned¬†up¬†the¬†broken¬†porcelain.¬†

Leo,¬†just‚Ä¶¬†take¬†some¬†time¬†*to¬†cool*¬†off.¬†I‚Äôll¬†come¬†back¬†in¬†a¬†few¬†days,¬†and we¬†can¬†talk.‚Äù¬†

was¬†slumped¬†on¬†the¬†sofa,¬†my¬†hand¬†covering¬†my¬†eyes.¬†

Get¬†out.‚Äù¬†

didn‚Äôt¬†touch¬†the¬†food.¬†I¬†spent¬†the¬†night¬†on¬†the¬†sofa,¬†wrapped¬†in¬†my¬†own¬†arms.¬†

Early¬†the¬†next¬†morning,¬†a¬†loud¬†banging¬†rattled¬†the front¬†door.¬†

opened¬†it,¬†and¬†my¬†father¬†stormed¬†in,¬†nearly¬†knocking¬†me¬†over.¬†

‚ÄòLeo!¬†Have¬†you¬†lost¬†your¬†mind?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄòIsabella¬†is¬†from¬†a¬†wealthy¬†family!¬†Of¬†course¬†she‚Äôs¬†had¬†boyfriends!¬†Once¬†you¬†were¬†married,¬†you¬†would¬†have¬†had¬†everything!¬†You‚Äôre¬†going¬†to¬†throw¬†all¬†that¬†away¬†over¬†one¬†little thing?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAll¬†our friends¬†and¬†family¬†were¬†there!¬†How¬†could¬†you¬†humiliate¬†me¬†like¬†that?‚Äù¬†

My¬†head¬†was¬†pounding.¬†‚ÄúDad,‚Äù¬†I¬†said¬†weakly,¬†‚Äúdid¬†you¬†not¬†see¬†the¬†video?¬†She¬†was¬†with¬†her¬†ex,¬†the¬†day¬†before¬†

our¬†wedding‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

He¬†waved¬†his¬†hand¬†dismissively.¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt¬†talk¬†to¬†me¬†about¬†that!¬†She‚Äôs a¬†fourth‚Äìgeneration¬†heiress!¬†Men¬†are¬†lining¬†up¬†to¬†marry¬†her.¬†This¬†only¬†happened¬†because¬†you¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†keep¬†her¬†satisfied!¬†If¬†you¬†were¬†man¬†enough¬†to¬†keep¬†her¬†focused¬†on¬†you,¬†this¬†never¬†would¬†have¬†happened.¬†You¬†were¬†about¬†to¬†marry¬†up,¬†to¬†enter¬†a¬†whole¬†new¬†world,¬†and¬†you¬†just¬†walk¬†away?¬†You‚Äôre¬†thirty¬†years¬†old,¬†Leo!¬†Where¬†are¬†*you¬†going*¬†to¬†find¬†another¬†woman¬†who¬†can¬†do¬†more¬†for¬†you¬†than¬†Isabella?‚Äù¬†

Hearing¬†those¬†words¬†come¬†from¬†him¬†was¬†no¬†surprise.¬†His¬†greed¬†knew¬†no¬†bounds,¬†especially¬†when¬†it¬†came¬†to¬†

rich¬†women.¬†

But¬†I¬†had¬†my¬†limits.¬†

‚ÄúDad,¬†if¬†you¬†love¬†her¬†so¬†much,¬†why¬†don‚Äôt¬†you¬†ask¬†her¬†to¬†adopt¬†you?‚Äù¬†

He¬†sputtered¬†with¬†rage,¬†his¬†hand¬†flying¬†up¬†to¬†slap¬†me.¬†I‚Äôd¬†been¬†drinking¬†all¬†night¬†on¬†an¬†empty¬†stomach,¬†and¬†

the¬†stress¬†sent¬†a¬†sharp,¬†cramping¬†pain¬†through¬†my¬†gut.¬†I¬†shoved¬†him¬†aside¬†and¬†ran¬†for¬†the¬†bathroom¬†again.¬†

Even¬†then,¬†he¬†didn‚Äôt¬†stop¬†yelling,¬†telling¬†me¬†I¬†was¬†inflexible,¬†that¬†my¬†lifestyle was¬†unhealthy.¬†But¬†every¬†senten.¬†

ce¬†somehow¬†circled¬†back¬†to¬†Isabella.¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs¬†beautiful,¬†she‚Äôs¬†sophisticated,¬†and¬†her¬†family¬†is¬†top‚Äìtier!¬†You couldn‚Äôt¬†hold¬†on¬†to¬†her,¬†and¬†now¬†she‚Äôll¬†fin¬†

someone¬†better¬†looking,¬†more¬†successful,¬†and¬†more¬†open‚Äìminded¬†than¬†you!¬†You‚Äôll¬†be¬†left¬†with¬†nothing!‚Äù¬†

His¬†words¬†echoed¬†down¬†the¬†hall¬†and¬†drilled¬†into¬†my¬†ears.¬†I¬†thought¬†of the¬†heartbroken¬†man¬†at¬†the¬†bar¬†last¬†

night.¬†The¬†delayed¬†realization¬†hit¬†me like¬†a¬†sledgehammer,¬†pounding¬†against¬†my¬†chest.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre¬†a¬†grown¬†man,¬†and¬†*you*¬†can‚Äôt¬†even¬†clean¬†up¬†after¬†yourself!¬†What¬†are¬†these¬†drops¬†of¬†blood¬†on¬†the¬†floor?¬†

‚ÄúOnly¬†Isabella¬†would¬†put¬†up¬†with¬†you.¬†Any¬†other¬†woman¬†would have¬†burned¬†this¬†place¬†to¬†the¬†ground¬†by¬†now.‚Äù¬†

I¬†slammed¬†the¬†bathroom¬†door¬†shut¬†and¬†crawled into¬†bed,¬†pulling¬†the¬†covers¬†over¬†my¬†head.¬†I¬†curled¬†into¬†a¬†

ball,¬†cocooned¬†in¬†the¬†darkness,¬†and¬†finally¬†let myself¬†sob.¬†

My¬†relationship¬†with¬†Isabella¬†didn‚Äôt¬†start¬†the¬†way¬†my¬†father¬†thought‚Äìme¬†climbing¬†the¬†social¬†ladder,¬†her¬†being¬†a¬†convenient,¬†docile¬†rich¬†girl.¬†

We¬†had¬†been¬†together¬†for¬†ten¬†years.¬†

We¬†fell¬†in¬†love¬†during¬†a¬†time¬†when¬†my¬†father‚Äôs¬†control over¬†my¬†life¬†was¬†at¬†its¬†most¬†suffocating.¬†In¬†our¬†tenth¬†year¬†together,¬†through¬†my¬†own¬†hard¬†work,¬†I¬†had¬†finally¬†bought¬†an¬†apartment¬†and¬†a¬†car¬†in¬†the¬†city¬†where¬†her¬†family¬†lived.¬†

I¬†had¬†teased¬†her,¬†‚ÄúApartment¬†and¬†car¬†are¬†paid¬†in¬†full.¬†I‚Äôve¬†saved¬†for¬†the¬†wedding,¬†and¬†I¬†even¬†bought¬†you¬†your¬†favorite¬†style¬†of¬†ring.¬†How¬†much¬†longer¬†do¬†I¬†have¬†to¬†wait¬†before¬†you‚Äôll¬†marry¬†me?‚Äù¬†

I recently started exploring Vietnamese coffee, and honestly, it's been a game-changer not just for my morning routine but also for my skin. I was reading about the [benefits of coffee for the skin](https://thecaphevietnam.com/collections/coffee), and it turns out that the antioxidants in high-quality beans can actually help reduce puffiness and brighten your face. Wild that the same cup that wakes me up might also help my skin glow.

Here in Dubai, I've been exploring different coffee beans, and the Vietnamese ones stand out for their bold yet smooth flavour. There's something earthy and comforting about the roast; it evokes the feeling of slow mornings and conversations with friends.

I'm curious. Has anyone else here tried Vietnamese beans or experimented with skincare recipes using coffee grounds? I'd love to hear what worked for you.",1,1760507595.0,u_Zealousideal_Bee100,0,1.0,False

So I got some savings, quit my job and am planning on going for a 2-3 month trip to Asia. Want to live off my savings for about 3 months and see if I manage to make any living online, if not, will have to go back to West üòü

(Want to focus on a few online projects while I'm happily unemployed, but no point spending that time in the west, where you have to cook by yourself, rent, food and bills are expensive.-- so might as well stay somewhere for those 3 months that's warm + more affordable living)

Nov-Feb

* Some place to relax, refresh, work out and be fit, eat healthy, good and affordable.

Places we've been considering 

* Koh Samui - (Been) really nice beaches, people, nice to relax, cheap food, although stays can add up a little, as I think recently got more popular
* Koh Chang - Really pretty beaches, never been but looks like really relax vibe, the stays can be quite expensive, you can find 13-17$ per night but they look OKAY, to find something nicer its 25-30+
* Da Nang, more affordable stays, nicer looking stays, cheaper food than Thailand and coffee, although less to see around apart from the long beach, but we have never been to Vietnam.

Not sure where else would be good to consider Uluwatu, Indonesia?

  
We plan on staying in one place for about 1.5 months to focus and lock in, then maybe travel around Asia, China, HK, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, for a month

  
Thank you for help!

After that we were both traveling him first and then me. I felt like in our time apart we never ran out of things to talk about and would just itch to jump on the phone.

     FTM to a 3 month old girl. She is honestly such a sweet, happy baby and generally easily soothed, and I felt really fortunate that (with my husband‚Äôs help) the newborn stage was about 10% as bad as I expected. She‚Äôs never been one to wake up on her own to eat, so from the beginning I would stay up until 2 am to do her night-feeds, husband would give her a bottle at 5, and I‚Äôd wake up at 8. She was easier to put down as a newborn (go figure) and now we‚Äôre in this stage where she needs multiple 2-3 hour naps per day otherwise she gets overtired and MAD. If I put her down, she won‚Äôt sleep longer than 20-30 minutes, so I spend most of the day feeding her/changing her, interacting with her for about an hour, and then holding her for several hours while she sleeps and then the cycle continues. I am also exclusively pumping (having to supplement more as supply is dropping due to me struggling to keep up with pumping during the day). 
     So, often times I have done literally nothing productive outside of taking care of this baby by the time my husband‚Äôs off work.  On good days, maybe I‚Äôll have time to frantically wash some bottles or meal prep a VERY basic meal. I feel terrible because my husband works full time and helps a ton with the baby/cleaning and yet I feel like I‚Äôm barely hanging on by a thread by the time he gets home. It‚Äôs not unusual for me to not drink any coffee or water if he doesn‚Äôt bring me any in the morning because it doesn‚Äôt cross my mind and I have to have easy food on hand otherwise I won‚Äôt eat. But then I see videos of moms with similar aged babies and they have entire morning routines (get dressed, cook, etc), will workout with baby in a bouncer or something and clean their houses etc. I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything extra until my husband‚Äôs off and can hold the baby. My core strength still isn‚Äôt great after pregnancy so holding her and doing stuff is difficult, and doing stuff with her in a carrier helps but is still much more difficult than just having my hands free. 
     So, most of the day I lay around with the baby and make dinner, maybe wash some bottles/pump parts and that‚Äôs it. I basically only do any cleaning on weekends while my husband usually does dishes/trash. And I somehow still feel so exhausted. I just feel guilty and lazy. Is this normal? How do I make it better??",2,1760507206.0,beyondthebump,4,0.75,False

I park my bike, unbuckle my helmet strap.  
My usual space is taken.  
A few meters ahead, I find a gap beside a familiar blue scooter - hers.  
We were once good friends, close enough to share comments about the office guys and our half-hearted plans to quit someday.

Hi,

Do you want to meet up for a cup of coffee or dinner in Tokyo (16-19Oct) with a Danish family who wants to understand Japanese life a bit more? 

We are a Danish couple+baby(7 months old. Very ‚Äúkawaii‚Äù ‚ò∫Ô∏è) travelling Japan and interesting in understanding Japanese life and culture a bit more during our trip - We are observing and hearing so many interesting things about Japan that we would love to understand better - A ‚Äúkawaii‚Äù-culture with cute toys, so many Vending machines, very polite but also cautious/formal people, high-tech country, working long hours, low fertility rate.

We are based in Tokyo close to Kita city office, but we are flexible in terms of meeting at a place that fits you. We are open to meeting at a restaurant, cafe or at your place and also the time(anytime between 9am and 7pm preferably)

Had some of their other sandwiches a few times, which were spectacular. The real MVP, for me anyways, is their breakfast combo.

Last time I checked it was $6 for just the sandwich, but for just over $7 you can get the sandwich and a coffee.

I have never done a mortise and tenon joint before, and I wanted to try one with this coffee table shelf I'm building. Perhaps too ambitiously.

The idea was to have the panel go into two stretchers, which in turn to into the lower parts of the legs.

I wanted to do a breadboard end style joint with haunched tenons and drawbores.

I used a mortiser in my makerspace to get the mortises, but realized I undersized it, so I was chiseling away at them for a long time.

In the process of trying to get the damned things to fit, I trimmed the longer tenons a little too short for me to be comfortable. Is there a way for me to lengthen them to better fit into the mortises I already cut?

The shoulder cannot be cut deeper: the panel length is already exactly the size of the aprons, and the aprons cannot be resized because they are castle jointed to the legs already.

I know this is huge to ask but i would really really appreciate any suggestions or feedback on this. We are also trying for a baby so would want to avoid raw food so any suggestions are highly appreciated. We want to do core tourist attractions and tourist traps as well because I do feel they offer a nice taste of the activity since they are so tourist oriented. I am also a part time content creator so i want to do fun instagram-worthy things as well hence kimono rental,etc are in the list.

A Concerning Trend at City Council Meetings Attending City Council meetings over the last few years, I‚Äôve noticed a troubling trend emerge. Since Othoniel Sierra became Mayor, public participation in council meetings has been increasingly restricted. Public comment time per person has been cut from five minutes to three, rules have been imposed that limit how residents are allowed to address Council, and even clapping is only permitted with the Mayor‚Äôs approval. On multiple occasions, the Mayor has threatened to have residents removed by the police for a simple applause being ‚Äúout of order.‚Äù If public comment exists to give residents a voice, doesn‚Äôt limiting that voice discourage involvement in our own government? Mayor Othoniel Sierra threatening to remove residents for clapping (2023): [https://www.youtube.com/live/G-J8l9m3D24?si=Fkzd-y0bDVFO6ADA&t=6179](https://www.youtube.com/live/G-J8l9m3D24?si=Fkzd-y0bDVFO6ADA&t=6179) September 22, 2025, a 70-year-old woman and another attendee asked to leave the Council chambers for clapping: [https://www.youtube.com/live/HE5JaTObO6w?si=dXtuz4w7FTU7D\_Zt&t=10468](https://www.youtube.com/live/HE5JaTObO6w?si=dXtuz4w7FTU7D_Zt&t=10468)

We have seen over the years under the current mayor, the participation of citizens getting up and speaking in front of council being on the decline. Council should welcome feedback from all voices, regardless of position rather than continue down a path of suppression.

It‚Äôs not just Englewood. We have seen a growing trend across our nation to silence the voices of opposing views. Our country was founded on free speech and we should hold that as sacred. Our government should be the guardians of free speech and ensure that all voices are heard.

The difference of council meetings between Englewood and Littleton are night and day‚Ä¶ Clapping at Littleton is fine, respect is shown between citizens and council. Strong turnout for certain topics at Littleton and everyone is encouraged to speak if they so choose too!

A waste of everyone's time. Truly? This is the type of viewpoint that supresses the voice of the citizens to accommodate personal desires or bias. It is a poor argument at best. When a citizen decides to become a servant of the city they need to understand everything that goes with the position.

The changes made to public comment were made because of listening to constituents. The timing was shortened so that more people can be heard within the time frame allotted and so that no one is forced to be at city council until the wee hours. Additionally, many of us spoke up about the applause and shouted comments because they make chambers hostile for people who are there to share differing view points - and we've said as much during public comment. There is a stipulation to free speech that refers to ""time, place and manner"" and as such city council is trying to uphold those values.

I agree with this and Rita while being a very nice person has her issues with her visions also. The time limits were probably put into place because people are usually complaining about stuff and become very rude themselves. As far as the applauding being restricted it was again for the same reason. People need to whine and when their supporters are with them they are just as rude. City Council members are in a thankless job and everyone is always thinking they are manipulating and thieves and always holding meetings behind everyones back. The true answer is that if you don't like run for office so we can throw mud at you or move.

This is not accurate History. I remember when the ‚Äúgood old boys‚Äù ran Council. I can tell you from personal experience that Randy Penn, Bob McCaslin, Linda Olsen and the others on council in the mid 2010‚Äôs did not vote with or support Rita. In fact last I checked Linda Olsen and her husband are active members of Vibrant Englewood‚Ä¶and actively supporting Othoniel and the pack of 4 during this election. So I ask you, is the pack of 4 the current ‚Äúgood old boys‚Äù on council?

If you truly paid attention to the councils of the past. Including the Penn days, you would understand that Rita was hardly in Rany's camp. In fact, she was quite often the dissenting voice to little avail. What we trul y need is a council that isnt in the pockets of the developers.

Sad that the mayor is more interested in control than in government for the people and by the people. I notice this trend in Douglas County also with the commissioners wanting to control everything, trying to make decisions behind closed doors, and limiting citizen‚Äôs input if it doesn‚Äôt agree with what they want.

Jackie except none of that‚Äôs actually true about what‚Äôs going on in Englewood. The same people were taking up all of the public comment spots for every single meeting and simply repeating the same thing they said at the previous meeting. The rules were changed to make a shorter comment time and to make folks who had already spoken wait until everyone else had gotten a chance to repeat. Additionally, the comment portion has gotten so out of hand with people, hooting and hollering and clapping that some folks didn‚Äôt feel comfortable, giving an opposing point of view. No silencing is being done of anyone. People are simply asked to be respectful and limit their time and not repeat themselves.

City council meetings are certainly different than they used to be. I used to go to almost every meeting. Getting to know the council members and having some real time interaction was important to me. I believe they have no concern about what citizens have to say there since the current majority took over. I believe they have more compassion and more attention to homeless people than the people who pay taxes since the current majority took over. I believe they are all in on giving away Englewood neighborhoods to the ""something for nothing"" crowd than they are the ""I earned what I have and am proud of it"" crowd. Government was not intended to be like this. Local governments should be a give and take at the meetings; citizens / council in conversation. Council should be listening to concerns of the citizens, not the politicians at the State Capital trying to drive the local agenda. It should be respect all the way around. Respect has been lost for the council and for the citizens.

They are part of a plan to 'transform' Colorado, set out in words by BObama long ago, a part of his rhetoric press to divide the nation, which he has unfortunately succeeded in doing, to it's slow deterioration. Look at the disaster for the low income people in Chicago, in their neighborhood where his egotistical hulk of a monument is being incompetently built, months and months delayed; he promised the residents that the area would not be gentrified, but the signs that it will be, are throughout. Look at the plans for the Ball Arena area - the front range of Colorado & beyond is going the same way, sIick tongued eIitists, one unprepared town at a time.

Sorry I disagree with the premise of this post. Citizens were not commenting or providing useful information or suggestions in many cases. One person spoke at every council meeting and started with ‚ÄòWith all due respect, no respect is due!‚Äù And then she would launch into the exact same 5 minute diatribe she had read from the meeting 2 weeks earlier, rinse and repeat at each meeting. Incidentally, she also posts on this app under a couple of different assumed names that are different from the name she uses when she addresses council. There were many repeat speakers repeating the same points at every meeting. It‚Äôs a waste of everyone‚Äôs time and insulting to these people who have stepped up to serve our city for very minimal pay. It‚Äôs time for people to be adults and learn a very valuable lesson that I learned from my father early on‚Ä¶ Just because your way was not chosen does not mean you were not heard. I think it‚Äôs wonderful for everyone to feel free to get up and give their viewpoint. But give it once give it succinctly, without insult‚Ä¶. and don‚Äôt expect people to applaud.

If you would have paid attention over the past years since Othaniel has been in council he has directed this change in how the citizens are now able to address council. This only happened under his watch. We went decades with no changes. So to Matt's point, when he and he ilk on council dont like how things are going they use austere measures to get their way. My duaghter used to do that when she was a toddler.

In the video clip, if he moved on to the next topic, the clapping was low and already fading, a sign, as I have experienced, that the person clapping was stopping, then he started in with his irritation, his mandate, and then a threat of removal. He has a bad attitude in an era in this nation where millions are sick of the canceI cuIture dispositions of forcing upon others a thing detrimental to the applicable community, and shutting them out of any say, and as has been seen in Lakewood, where their own CC actually nullified a citizen vote effort; how ironic that the offenders are those who claim to be defending democracy; when no one can say anything which is taken seriously, even a legally qualifying vote by a public can just be swept away. The hypocrisy reeks of rot.

Littleton doesn‚Äôt have homeless all over their Main Street area, perhaps reach out to the leaders there to see what they‚Äôre doing right. Pressure them more (make it uncomfortable) to move out of the area and to communities that have outreach and services to help. Englewood is small in comparison and we as a community do not have the funds. Attract business instead of rubber stamping multi unit housing. Businesses will grow the tax base, which we obviously need with all of the businesses that have left and our closing.

Check out the post from Vicky Hoffman on how Littleton‚Äôs council meetings are conducted! Such a contrast to Englewood‚Äôs. It sounds like a great example of respect and inclusion. I think the entire city of Englewood would benefit as a whole from warm welcoming actions encouraging participation from city council! Doing so would inspire the vast creativity and intelligence citizens have to contribute to the council! A warm welcoming tone especially on public comments vs curt tones conveying a overt pressure to get through the section of the meeting send completely different messages. I believe the citizens want to voice and see that their voice is respected and responded to. How included would you feel witnessing the mayor's speech and actions that genuinely covey, ""I am listening to you and I am working for you""?

1o72ly1,https://v.redd.it/b1ppr17ko7vf1,Fixing my Espresso Shot Problems [Breville The Barista Touch BES880],"I‚Äôll start and summarize by saying that if you‚Äôre just starting out, most of your problems are due to grind or dosing issues. Even if you manage to get some okay espresso from your first bag of beans, you‚Äôll quickly find out that as you switch beans or even just switch bags of the same beans that you may need to dial-in your grind and dose each time you change. I think I read this somewhere, but I did not truly grasp how crucial that would be. 

I found myself here trying to wrap my head around what seemed to be a ‚Äúpressure‚Äù related issue where I wasn‚Äôt getting much espresso ‚Äúflow‚Äù and after doing a lot of digging I thought I‚Äôd share. Turns out, my grind was too fine, so I was almost making a mud patty instead of a nice moist, but firm puck.

My biggest issue was overthinking rather than thinking through it logically. I was more worried about the grind than the dose, until I realized that the dose is just as important.

To fix the issue,I started by making incremental changes starting with:

1.	‚Å†Increasing my grind sized 2 points, then pulling a shot. Presto- we were flowing again, but too fast, and under extracting.
2.	‚Å†The next time, increased the dose to 18g, better, but still a bit too fast and under extracted.
3.	‚Å†Next time adjusted the grind finer, and it was over extracting again (dripping slowly. what seemed like not enough pressure again, but not as bad).
4.	‚Å†Put the grind back to one notch more coarse, and instead added .5g making my dose 18.5g.

It worked.

I‚Äôve found from several resources that a 30 second total pull with extraction starting at 6-8 seconds resulting in a 1:2 (dose:yield) ratio is on the money.

It‚Äôs pulling perfect shots for the first time ever.

Hope this helps someone.

Update- I‚Äôm at a 17.6g dose, pulling a 35g yield. Im finding that a new, fresh bag of beans will be over extracted by keeping the grind the same. Rather than recalibrating my grind, reducing the dose by .4g, I can still achieve 1:2 ratio.

When I get to about 1/2 of the 2.5 lb bag of beans, I can go back up to 18g of grinds and get 36g of espresso.

Denn Reddit bestimmt mit, was KI √ºber Marken erz√§hlt: Bist du vorbereitet? üß†

Viele im Marketing halten die Plattform hier immer noch f√ºr eine nerdige Nische mit Memes und Text-Tapeten. Doch tats√§chlich hat sie sich ‚Äì wisst ihr alle ‚Äì zu einem der spannendsten Orte f√ºr Markenkommunikation entwickelt.¬†**Nicht zuletzt durch GenAI:**

Warum?

Zum einen wird Reddit gerade zur wichtigsten Plattform weltweit f√ºr echte, von Menschen gepr√ºfte Erfahrungen ‚Äì und damit zum Gegenpol zur wachsenden Flut an KI-Content ungewisser Herkunft.

Zum anderen nutzen die KI-Systeme selbst Reddit als eine bevorzugte Quelle, um Antworten zu generieren. Wer hier sichtbar ist, erreicht also nicht nur Millionen Nutzer:innen, sondern auch die ‚Äûdigitalen Gehirne‚Äú von ChatGPT, Gemini & Co.

Bei unserem n√§chsten Coffee & Learn am 16. Oktober erkl√§ren meine Kollegin¬†[Nadine Nicolas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-nadine/)¬†und ich, was Reddit f√ºr die neue Realit√§t der Internetsuche bedeutet und wie Marken die Plattform strategisch im eigenen Kanal-Mix einsetzen k√∂nnen.¬†**Seid dabei und bringt eure Sichtweisen ein!**",1,1760506023.0,ContentMarketing,0,1.0,False
1o72kd6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o72kd6,Is it possible to extend a tenon's length if it's too short?,"So I have never done a mortise and tenon joint before, and I wanted to try one with this coffee table shelf I'm building.

The idea was to have the panel go into two stretchers, which in turn to into the lower parts of the legs.

I wanted to do a breadboard end style joint with haunched tenons and drawbores.

I used a mortiser in my makerspace to get the mortises, but realized I undersized it, so I was chiseling away at them for a long time.

In the process of trying to get the damned things to fit, I trimmed the longer tenons a little too short for me to be comfortable. Is there a way for me to lengthen them to better fit into the mortises I already cut?

The shoulder cannot be cut deeper: the panel length is already exactly the size of the aprons, and the aprons cannot be resized because they are castle jointed to the legs already.

I didn't think this was remotely possible..I'm on birth control and I have PCOS. I've always been told that it would likely be incredibly hard for me to get pregnant if I ever chose to go that route. My dr sent me to the ER where I learned that the baby was still inside me and I hadn't...fully miscarried yet, but was certainly going to and my obgyn set me up for an emergency d&c. I found out that I was 12 weeks and 5 days pregnant. So fucking insane to me. I was *so* pregnant and I had..no idea. But so many things make sense now. The signs were there and I just didn't know.

I requested to see the ultrasound and there it was; my baby. My dr said it looked healthy and had a heartbeat. In the moment I couldn't let myself feel too attached because I knew it was going to go away no matter what I wanted. I think I would have chosen to terminate because of where I'm at in life, but I feel so much loss and idk how I could've made that choice in hindsight. In some ways I'm glad the choice was taken from me, but in other ways I feel so betrayed by my body. I feel so much guilt. I've been living life normally..drinking, going out, daily coffee, eating sushi, taking my adderall (as prescribed), etc. I'm so scared this was my one and only opportunity and I fucked it up. Idk how it happened and idk how it slipped past me. I feel such a deep sense of loss, I feel so heartbroken, I feel so fucking devastated that I didn't know and I didn't have any time to feel a connection to my baby. I could have loved it. I shared my body with it (them? idek how to talk about it üò≠) for such a long time and only got to know for like 12 hours :(. I feel fucked up grieving when I probably would have terminated anyway, especially when other women know they're pregnant and know they want to keep their baby. I just don't know how to make sense of things, how to make sense of my feelings, what to do with this grief. I touch my tummy and I wish so badly it was still with me. Every day gets a little better physically but it's getting harder to compartmentalize my feelings and I'm so heartbroken.

How can I even feel this way? I have an appt with a therapist tomorrow but I feel bad even doing that, like it's not for someone like me. Have any of you gone through a similar situation? I know this is fairly unusual and I feel so so alone. ",2,1760505252.0,Miscarriage,0,1.0,False

You ever wake up feeling like the Tin Man after a rainstorm? ü§ñ Yeah, I get it. One minute you‚Äôre all spry and ready to take on the world, and the next, you‚Äôre groaning like you've just run a marathon‚Ä¶ in quicksand. 

But here‚Äôs a little secret: reclaiming your mobility after 50 doesn't have to feel like climbing a mountain. üôå It‚Äôs more like a gentle stroll in the park, complete with a few cheerful stretches! Let‚Äôs ditch the stiffness and embrace some zest in our lives. 

### Here are some simple stretches that can really transform your day:

- **Neck Rolls**: Tilt your head gently to one side, then roll it slowly forward, and to the other side. Repeat a few times. No more ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt look left‚Äù frustrations!  
- **Shoulder Shrugs**: Shrug those shoulders up to your ears like you‚Äôre saying ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the deal?‚Äù Then let them drop. Repeat. It‚Äôs like giving your stress a little exit strategy!  
- **Seated Torso Twist**: Sitting? Perfect. Twist gently to one side, then the other. It‚Äôs like giving your spine a little massage while you‚Äôre at it!  
- **Hamstring Stretch**: Stand and reach down toward your toes (or as far as you can). Feel that sweet relief in the back of your legs. Just don‚Äôt fall over, okay? üòÇ  
- **Hip Openers**: Stand up, lift your knee to your chest, and then rotate it outwards. Now you‚Äôre ready to dance like nobody‚Äôs watching! üíÉ  

Just imagine gliding through your day with ease instead of waddling like a penguin. 

The best part? You don‚Äôt need to set aside an hour for this. Just a few minutes in the morning, or even while watching TV, can make a huge difference. Seriously, I once did a little stretch while waiting for my coffee to brew, and my back thanked me later. ‚òïÔ∏è 

And let‚Äôs not forget:

**Keep things light and fun!** It doesn‚Äôt have to be a serious workout session. Put on some music, or grab a friend to join you. Remember, we believe in strongest people, and taking these small steps is a big deal! üí™ Check this out for some inspo: [Link](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb)

Sometime around 2015-2018, I came to Portland and went to a coffee shop that I still dream about. They only served black drip coffee, and I remember it tasting like a blueberry muffin. It was the best black coffee I‚Äôve ever had. 

I remember it was near a former Blue Star Donuts location on Mississippi Ave, near where Laughing Planet Cafe is now. 

I‚Äôm really hoping this place moved somewhere else. Please someone remember this place. ",2,1760505106.0,askportland,0,0.75,False

Hi everyone! 

I've (23 F) run into a interpersonal issue with someone (23M) at my workplace, and was hoping to get some outside perspective on what might be going on here because I'm having a hard time reading it. 

So I'm new to the workplace, and our team has a program where we're paired with a peer-mentor of sorts to answer questions and ease the transition. My peer mentor has been here for a year, and I believe we are the same age in the same position. 

I reached out initially and set up a meeting. He suggested a Cafe and was very friendly, extremely talkative. He even treated me to a coffee. I wanted to make sure my questions wouldn't infringe or burden him at any point, so I clarified whether he was comfortable with me texting him if I needed something answered. He was super open to the idea and said ""I'm an open book"". 

Then I saw him at a couple of work events and we spoke normally - he had the same enthusiastic tone. Over text he was also extremely kind and excited to answer questions. So essentially I thought we were more like new friends and coworkers. 

However, sometimes when i would see him unplanned or outside of a social event, it would seem he didn't recognize me. No hi/hello/how are you. Not even a smile. Just a blank expression. He would also never say hi first. I'm the kind of person that says hi to everyone I know, and new people I meet often say that im very welcoming, so usually ppl reciprocate my greeting warmly. If he'd respond, it would always be a short ""oh, hey"". This happened a couple of times, and sometimes he would cut a convo I began and get distracted by something else. I found this pretty rude, so for a while I just thought he disliked me, and therefore wasn't interested in holding a conversation or initiating one. I dont know if this is relevant, but at one point, I remember suggesting that I might be asking too many questions over text, and he just responded with ""no problem"" without any sort of exclamation (like he usually would) which made me think I was right about being an annoyance to him.

I spoke to some of my friends about it and they told me to match his energy. Essentially, if he doesn't reach out, not to reach out to him. Which I did. I felt pretty uncomfortable with the dynamic, because over text he would Crack jokes and be very expressive, but in person, it seemed like he would avoid me. I wanted to essentially end the peer mentorship cleanly bc it seemed we didn't mesh well. Some context, I did tell him that I would pay him back for the coffee (personally just makes me feel even when I pay ppl back if they pay for me). 

One day I met him outside work, and suggested to return the favour (this was my way of getting even and leaving things on a good note). He seemed pretty short with me then too. I don't blame him, I kind of just saw him, and like I usually do, struck up a conversation and asked if he could spare 30 min. But also, I didn't like his energy and was glad things were coming to an end. It was a short meeting, very awkward and dry. He did try asking me questions about myself though. I avoided talking too much bc I thought he already disliked me at that point. I also stopped messaging him with questions.

Since then though, I have noticed that whenever he sees me, he smiles and says hi. He even came up to me multiple times one day at work to strike a conversation. More often it's just the smile, wave of the hand, and hi, though. 

He seems pretty knowledgeable and has given pretty good advice until now. So I do value his presence, but now I'm confused about his boundaries. I'm left with 2 possibilities that might explain the situation: 
1. He dislikes me/i make him uncomfortable, but tolerates me and keeps up pleasantries 
2. He is socially awkward and has a hard time holding conversations when not planned. 

If it is the 2nd, I wouldn't mind striking up more conversations, but I don't want to be a burden or make him feel even more uncomfortable, in case I'm wrong. I also cannot just ask him which one it is since I don't know him that well. 

A bit of context, I haven't seen him interacting with others where he initiates conversations very often, unless it is at a event he is involved in. He seems to be comfortable around a small group of close friends though.

I'm not sure what to do, or how to interpret his behaviour? What do we think is the move?",3,1760505093.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False
1o72aut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1o72aut/mr_sunshine/,Mr. Sunshine,"My name is Nathan Malcolm. I used to work for the FBI. I did my share of drug busts and tracking organized crime, but I‚Äôve only hunted one serial killer. In the early 2000s, my team and I were assigned to hunt down the serial killer known as Mr. Sunshine. As is the case with many serial killers, he gained the nickname through his M.O. His victims‚Äîfifteen that we know of‚Äîwere always found in locations facing the East and at times when they would be discovered at sunrise, and based on the reports from the coroners, they were all killed at dawn, just minutes before the sun would come up. They were all found with their faces forced into smiles. It wasn't that he had mutilated them to create the smile; they had been found with their throats cut. Their smiles, though, had been determined to have been the result of the muscles in their faces somehow pulling their lips back into a forced grin that stretched literally from ear to ear, to the point that their lips had torn like rags. This would be odd enough, but unlike most serial killers, he had witnesses on multiple occasions, but when it came to describing his face, all they would ever say was that he smiled. Naturally, we considered the possibility that perhaps we were dealing with multiple killers, or that Mr. Sunshine was drugging the witnesses somehow. What was even stranger, though, was the fact that the victims had no apparent connection, nothing to connect an M.O. to. They were seemingly picked at random. Furthermore, their bodies all vanished at numerous points, even with an increase in security. 

My team‚ÄîAgents Langstrom, Prescott, Martinez, Kilpatrick, Rosencoff, and myself‚Äîhad received a tip that Mr. Sunshine had been sighted in an abandoned warehouse. By this point, he had claimed the lives of eight people, and we were getting desperate. So after getting the proper clearance, we entered the building, guns drawn, intending to arrest or put down this creep. The second we entered, we heard it: the echoed laughter. We didn't turn on our flashlights, as the lights inside were on despite the electricity being cut off two years prior, something Kilpatrick confirmed.

He took Langstrom first. 

We had only traveled a few paces in and were getting used to the light when it suddenly flashed off, like someone had flicked a light switch, then immediately turned it back on. It disoriented us at first, and even before I looked around, I sensed something in our footsteps, or more accurately, the absence of one pair. We turned and there was no sign of Langstrom anywhere. No blood, no noise‚Äîhe was just gone. Like We began getting worried, reporting back to HQ of our situation. We were told to proceed with caution. HQ then told us to begin investigating separate parts of the warehouse, two agents to search for our missing comrade as well as potential victims/survivors and the remaining three to continue our sweep for Mr. Sunshine. As Kilpatrick and Rosencoff broke off from the main group, we continued traversing the warehouse. Martinez noticed it after we‚Äôd traversed a quarter of the warehouse. She looked from the back to the front, then pointed it out to us pale-faced. 

We hadn‚Äôt moved further than twelve feet from warehouse‚Äôs entrance, where Langstrom had been taken. 

As we noticed it too, we heard Rosencoff begin to give his report, before stopping. ‚ÄúWha‚Äî‚Äù His radio cut out, and the light flashed again. We kept trying to call him, and at one point, Prescott, a close friend of Rosencoff, yelled out for him. Our radios broadcast the same deranged laughter we had heard before. Then the light flashed again, and we quickly did a headcount. Martinez, Prescott, and myself were still there. That meant‚Ä¶

We began calling frantically for Kilpatrick, to no avail. We radioed to HQ for orders. We received nothing but dead air. At least, so it seemed until a man‚Äôs voice giggled childishly.

Our professionalism left us then. We began screaming into the warehouse, demanding that Mr. Sunshine show himself. Whenever we heard laughter in any given direction, we would begin firing at it. Then the lights flashed twice. I kept my eyes shut, expecting to be taken like the others. But as I opened my eyes, I saw that I was still standing in the dusty, bright warehouse. Instead of relief, I felt my stomach drop, and any bravado I had left evaporated. I didn't need to turn around‚ÄîI felt the absence of Prescott and Martinez. 

It was resignation rather than courage or hope that drove me onward. I wasn't holding out hope that I might be able to save my teammates; I just moved forward, going through the motions. Somehow, I managed to push through the oppressive light, and that was when I saw him on a catwalk above me. Mr. Sunshine was dressed in an immaculately white two-piece suit with a red button-up shirt and a pair of red gloves, as well as impossibly shiny black shoes. On the lapel of his jacket was an ornate pin of something I couldn't identify. And his face was hidden in the light, except for his toothy, equally shiny grin. I made my way up the metal stairs, aiming my gun at him and telling him to get on the ground. Then he raised his hand, and the light dimmed just a little. But it was just enough. Enough for me to take in the horror of what he had done. I understand now what the witnesses meant when they said they couldn't place any distinct features‚Äîthey probably had their memories locked away from the horror.

Above him hung my team, along with the other fifteen. They were suspended in midair, held aloft by this unholy light in various positions. Except I realized that it wasn't just their bodies he was keeping; it was *them.* Their souls, their energy‚Äîhe was keeping *them*, feeding on them. Like how a spider saves its prey wrapped in silk, so too was he holding them wrapped in these infernal rays. And even now, they gazed down vacantly, forced smiles on their faces and tears running from their eyes. 

Not knowing what else to do, I aimed my handgun at Mr. Sunshine and unloaded each round into him, tears of grief, rage, and terror running down my own face. The bullets struck him, and blood began staining his suit. He staggered back, his smile turning into a pained grimace, and in an instant he was inches in front of me, his gloved hand around my throat, lifting me up. I heard vicious words in my head, saying that I didn‚Äôt belong up there yet. He told me that if I knew the truth about my team, I would understand why they were up there, and why the other victims were as well. He threw me off the catwalk, resulting in a broken leg. Just like that, the light vanished, and he along with his victims were gone. The radio came back to life, with HQ frantically demanding a status report. 

I was unable to provide a plausible explanation as to how my team had vanished without a trace, or why our radios had suddenly stopped working properly. It wasn't as if they had been turned off; they were receiving signals. But all HQ heard from my team was laughter. *Their* laughter. I was cleared of suspicion; there was simply no evidence pointing to me. 

I resigned after my leg had healed up. The trauma of losing my team coupled with what I had witnessed was too much for me. In the years following the incident, I often wondered what he was talking about, what the victims possessed that made them desirable to Mr. Sunshine, and what I lacked. I studied up and down, looking in obscure places for knowledge on the occult that might tell me who or what Mr. Sunshine was. Then I received an unmarked envelope this morning. Inside was a letter. 

*Dear (former) Agent Malcolm, 

I hope you‚Äôre doing well. I understand our last meeting was brief, and we had little time to spare. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve had questions aplenty about why I let you go. The simplest answer was that you were to me what a minnow is to a fisherman, or a fawn to a big-game hunter. Your team and my previous smilers all had something I wanted: pain. I suppose Kilpatrick never told you about the time his four-year-old brother was swept away by a river current when he was six despite his best efforts to save him, and how it had happened after they got into a childish argument that caused the brother to slip, or how Martinez accidentally shot her father thinking he was a burglar as he drunkenly stumbled back into her home when she was nine. And don‚Äôt get me started on how Prescott left his son unattended in a supermarket for a total of ten seconds, only for the boy to vanish. The others all had similar issues. You, though? You were remarkably ordinary. Disappointingly ordinary. Oh, you had the odd death in the family here, a failed relationship there, but nothing that truly haunted you. But then you met me. I‚Äôve consumed your thoughts like rabies to the nervous system, corrupting every thought you‚Äôve had. You barely smile, if ever, because it makes you think of me. You never leave your home because you know I‚Äôm out here. And I‚Äôll show my hand here: you surprised me. Before then, I had been confident that you would be too consumed with terror and awe to pull the trigger. Perhaps I had grown too arrogant. In any case, perhaps a little reunion is in order. The anniversary is coming up, after all. Why not meet us at the same place? You can decline if you wish, but it would be wonderful to see you again. And who knows? Maybe you can do what you tried to do the first time. Or maybe not. You never know until you try. 

Regards,
Mr. Sunshine.*

The handgun I‚Äôve kept in my home has been sitting on the coffee table in front of me for hours, along with several mags, the letter, files on Mr. Sunshine, and a picture of my team and I. 

I don't know what to do. I want to move on with my life, leave Mr. Sunshine in the dust, but at the same time, I want to finally close the book on this. If I could make him bleed once, I can do it again. I just don't know. Something happened a few minutes ago that may be tipping my indecision, however. The broken radio I kept unbeknownst to the Bureau crackled to life, and I heard laughter on the other end. Laughter from Martinez, Kilpatrick, Rosencoff, Prescott, Langstrom, and Mr. Sunshine.

any old country diner. It‚Äôs about the size of a short, double wide trailer. So, the interior is a
bit claustrophobic, but just spacious enough that you won‚Äôt feel trapped. It has a unique‚Ä¶smell‚Äî like cigarette smoke and floral perfume had some fucked-up love child and decided it needed to die there. Pictures of unidentifiable people eating are randomly taped to the wood-paneled walls (partially for advertising but mostly to cover some holes). A flickering neon ‚Äúopen‚Äù sign sits in one of the large windows. They‚Äôre framed with old Christmas lights and let in a natural light when the sun‚Äôs up, but also allow you get a full view of the road and surrounding woods. 

Another sight you may have the misfortune, (or blessing depending on who you ask) of
seeing out those windows, would be what we have dubbed as ‚Äúthe sign dancer.‚Äù A hairy and
rather‚Ä¶voluptuous man who will occasionally appear and pole dance on the sign out front.
We‚Äôre not sure if he‚Äôs a ghost or just some dude with too much time on his hands, but we do know that his dances can make people feel things. It‚Äôs different for everyone, Mrs. Kelvins
said she felt peace for the first time in years, while Mr. Branson said he felt ‚Äútrue‚Äù horror.

However, after having watched the man dance myself, I‚Äôd say it was interesting, but mostly
kinda disturbing. (Like watching someone chug expired milk.) 

If you feel eyes on you, like someone watching you, then don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs probably just Lucky, the diner‚Äôs resident veteran coyote.

He‚Äôs not exactly a vet, as he‚Äôs never really been in any war‚Äî not any major ones, at least.
Just the on-going one that he has against the local farmers and their chickens, but it‚Äôs left
the poor bastard looking like he just came out of Nam. 

He‚Äôs only got one eye, three feet,
half an ear, and the fur on his tail seemingly refuses to grow normally. We (and by we, I
mean *I*) felt bad and gave him a piece of so old food, *one time*. And now, he refuses to leave. He‚Äôs been hit by at least three cars and two trucks (that we know of) and still insists
on staring at people as they eat.

As for upkeep, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just seen as an aesthetic choice.

An old, eyeless mannequin with a purple Mardi Gras necklace and a name tag sticker on its
chest that reads ‚ÄúHello! My name is: Tomila‚Äù sits next to the entrance as a makeshift
coatrack. If you get close enough to it, you‚Äôll notice it has that sickly sweet aroma of rot
clinging to it. (No matter how much it‚Äôs cleaned or sprayed with Febreze, it will *not* go away.)
A cork board covered in papers, ranging from a handful of have-you-seen-me‚Äôs to advertisements and newspaper clippings, sits on the other side. Booths are lined up against smudged windows and advertisements for local businesses are trapped under the clear, yet sticky, plastic coverings on the tables.

There‚Äôs an open kitchen, with grease-stained utilities that haven‚Äôt been updated since poodle skirts were a thing, and coffee pots that look like they survived Chernobyl. A dented mini fridge softly hums at the back wall, next to the batter covered waffle irons that strangely smell like burnt hair every time they‚Äôre used. There‚Äôs a milkshake station (It‚Äôs continued functionality is proof that miracles really do exist, and honestly, it‚Äôs what gets me through the day sometimes.) that sits next to the drink machine, where the stubborn, red sticky mess beneath it all has been fighting with the grease to become a permanent fixture.

The checkered linoleum floors are cracked and stained in some places. Sometimes when it rains, a mysterious brownish liquid‚Äî that smells like pennies ‚Äîoozes from them and forms shapes similar to human footprints. A jukebox, riddled with bullet holes, sits next to
the bathroom hallway (Sometimes it ‚Äúglitches‚Äù and the screams of, what I can only assume are, the damned come from it (Usually, it has to be unplugged for a few minutes whenever that happens.) and plays country music and the occasional pop or rock song.

I‚Äôm not one hundred percent sure, but I think the health inspector is either sleeping with the
owners‚Äô daughter or has brain damage or (who knows) maybe it‚Äôs both. Like, this guy will
straight up look at the weird black goop stuff in the mop station and be like, ‚ÄúYeah, this is okay.‚Äù It‚Äôs shady as fuck, but if there‚Äôs one thing we can count on, it‚Äôs that he‚Äôll sign off on this shit hole as being ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù like, pretty much no matter what.

If you find yourself needing to go number one or two (or three) after a meal or just in general, then you may find a hot dog on the floor next to the toilet paper rack. 

Its appearance in one of the two bathrooms depends entirely on what day of the week it is,
though. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, it will be in the men‚Äôs room. But on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, it will be in the women‚Äôs room. It‚Äôs absent on Saturdays. And while we highly suggest against its consumption, we cannot control what you do.
Having said that, the people who have eaten it claim it allowed them to have seen into the future for a few hours. Others became violently ill (just as we predicted they would), and were doomed to spend their evening in the very room they consumed the forsaken cylinder
of meat in.

If you do stop by, don‚Äôt be a stranger! I live out back, am pretty much always on the clock, and I‚Äôm more than happy to take your order or sit and chat or both! I‚Äôm bored as fuck and my current coworker, Kurt, isn‚Äôt a very good conversationalist. And there isn‚Äôt any phone service or internet at the diner. So, if you have any important calls to make, you‚Äôll have to go out to the edge of the parking lot. Or you can use the old phone booth! It‚Äôs pretty much in the same place. It‚Äôs next to the only streetlight we have out here, so it‚Äôs pretty hard to miss. Do be careful if you ever have to use it, though. We have the occasional hobo or crazy person come out of the woods to try and ‚Äúphone home.‚Äù They can get pretty violent, and as much as I‚Äôd like the show, I‚Äôm supposed to treat the parking lot fights as though they were happening in-store. The owners put that rule in place, and they review the cameras to make sure we break them up. And while I was given a large walking stick to help, I really don‚Äôt want to deal with anymore violence than I already have to.

On the odd occasion that I‚Äôm not there, but you still want to chat with someone. Then I
highly suggest that you be cautious with the locals. Some of them are lovely people, don‚Äôt
get me wrong. I‚Äôd just rather not leave any of my co‚Äôs to deal with a fight, should one break out. Because, while Southern hospitality is a given with most of our regulars, it can still‚Ä¶run a bit short, if you know what I mean.

If you go in the mornings you may meet a fair bit of them, like Mr. Stimson, an older man
who usually comes between the hours of seven and nine AM to order a few cups of coffee
and a gravy biscuit. He used to own the old scrap yard. And despite there not being any big
wild cats native to this area and the nearest zoo not housing any, he will tell you all about
how his dogs were snatched, one at a time, by a black panther. Never mind the fact that
he‚Äôs only ever had but one dog. (It‚Äôs very sweet and follows him like a little shadow.
Sometimes he brings it to the diner.)

Mr. Canterbury, he always gets the morning special that comes with one waffle, two eggs,
and a side of bacon or sausage. But he gets the bacon instead of the sausage, because he
claims that it ‚Äútaste too much like human flesh.‚Äù (I can assure you now, that the sausage is
not made of flesh. We‚Äôre not sure where it comes from, but the owners assured us that we
weren‚Äôt eating living people.)

Ms. Cleo Janice comes in late in the afternoon and orders exactly one egg, a thing of cheesy
hash browns, and a strawberry milkshake. She always says that Tomila is ‚Äúcrying‚Äù and that
the mannequin is ‚Äúsick.‚Äù I think she may be projecting her feelings and trying to ask for
some form of help. But the last time I just up and asked if she needed any, she had what I
can only call, a nervous breakdown. Where she proceeded to take one of her boobs out and
play with it in front of me, all the while insisting that it was *Tomila* that was needing help. I‚Äôve considered banning her from the diner, but she tips, like, really good. So, I just keep my mouth shut and give her what she orders.

Then there‚Äôs Mr. Johnson. He doesn‚Äôt really have a usual meal, insisting that we should
‚Äúsurprise‚Äù him and give him whatever. However, he always refuses to drink water. He claimed it had made him unable to eat fish. As every time he saw one, it apparently had his late wife‚Äôs face and would *‚Äúbeg him to stop‚Äù* or *‚Äúlet go‚Äù* with her voice.

If you have questions, then so do I. But unfortunately for the both of us, they will forever go unanswered. Because Mr. Johnson, the slippery bastard that he was, died. They found his face nailed to his kitchen table a few months ago, with his skinless body out by Muffler‚Äôs dam.

The local police are still trying to find both the rest of his skin and who did it.

But to sum it all up, the diner‚Äôs weird as fuck, but it‚Äôs become a major part of my life. So, I
figured I‚Äôd start sharing a few of my experiences with y‚Äôall.",1,1760504572.0,ComedicNosleep,0,1.0,False

It's about the quiet mornings spent sipping coffee as the world wakes up around us, it's about the unexpected kindness from a stranger that restores our faith in humanity, it's about the feeling of warm sunshine on our skin on a perfect summer day. Yet, amidst these beautiful moments, there exists a silence‚Äî a silence that speaks volumes in its depth and complexity, a silence that often goes unnoticed but holds immense power.

- It's the silence of unspoken thoughts and untold stories that linger in the air, weaving a tapestry of emotions and experiences that shape our inner world.
- It's the silence of a heartbreak that hushes the soul, forcing us to confront the raw vulnerability of our human existence.
- It's the silence of unshed tears and stifled laughter, of words left unsaid and feelings kept hidden behind closed doors.
- It's the silence of longing and nostalgia, of memories fading like echoes in a vast, empty room.
- It's the silence of unanswered questions and unexplored possibilities that hover on the edge of our consciousness, begging to be acknowledged.

In a world inundated with noise and distractions, the power of silence is often underestimated. It is in these quiet moments, devoid of external chaos, that we can truly listen to ourselves and connect with our innermost thoughts and emotions.

- Embracing silence is not about avoiding conversations or shying away from interactions; it's about finding peace and solace in the spaces between words and actions.
- It's about cultivating mindfulness and self-reflection, allowing ourselves the opportunity to sift through the complexities of our minds and hearts.
- It's about learning to appreciate the beauty of solitude and stillness, recognizing that silence can be a companion rather than an adversary.
- It's about acknowledging that in the absence of noise, our inner voices can speak volumes, guiding us towards self-discovery and emotional growth.

1o722ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o722ft/lost_boys_an_scp_1802_story/,Lost Boys (an SCP 1802 story),"Terrance Phillips was a kind-hearted man who lived in a home inherited from his grandmother. He lived alone in the two-story colonial but the memories of his grandmother were enough to keep him company most days. 

Terrance was a writer by trade. More specifically, he was the editor of the King George Journal Press, a local newspaper in northern Virginia. He spent most days working from home since the pandemic and enjoyed the quiet his grandmother's home afforded him. With no one else occupying the house, he often worked late into the night, happily typing away on his computer while listening to his grandmother's old records. 

It was on one of these nights when he heard a knocking at the door. Terrance glanced down at the clock, it was already half past midnight. Grabbing his pistol from the drawer and tucking it into his waistband, Terrance strode to the door with baited breath. A knock at this hour could mean nothing good. 

To Terrance‚Äôs surprise, he opened the door to see five middle school-aged boys standing in the snow on the doorstep. Terrance braced himself for whatever social media prank he would soon be the victim of but to his surprise, the short boy in front spoke politely and with a slight British accent.

‚ÄúExcuse me, mister, we've gotten a bit lost in the dark, all these old houses look the same in the streetlight. We was wondering if you would mind us coming in from the cold for a bit while we get our bearings?‚Äù
Terrance was caught off guard but thought there could be no harm in letting a few neighborhood kids warm themselves for a minute. So Terrance made his first mistake of the evening. 

‚ÄúI don't see why not, I've already got a fire going in my living room to the right here. You boys are welcome to sit around the fire until I finish my work for the evening or until you're feeling ready to venture back out into the cold.‚Äù

The boys thanked him profusely and hurried in to huddle around the fire.
Terrance suddenly felt as if he was forgetting something he should have asked earlier
‚ÄúDo you boys need‚Ä¶ Excuse me, could you not touch the walls? The paint is very old and it's difficult to clean without damaging it. Um, what was I saying‚Ä¶ oh right, do you boys need to borrow my phone to call your parents?‚Äù

The short boy was again the one to reply, ‚ÄúNo, sir, that‚Äôs all right our parents know already‚Äù

Terrance turned to the kitchen, confused by what the talkative boy had meant. Perhaps the group had texted their parents while still on the steps. Terrance shrugged before grabbing a fresh cup of coffee for himself and loading up a serving dish with mugs of hot water and a variety of tea flavors for the boys to choose from. 

Terrance returned to the living room and set the dish on the coffee table. 

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs some tea if you boys would like some, I remember being your age and staying out in those woods too late a time or two, it brings joy to my heart to see kids can still play outside.‚Äù

There was an awkward silence as none of the boys acknowledged Terrence‚Äôs attempt at small talk, but they all politely thanked him for the tea and sat back down. 

Resigned the the fact that he was out of touch with the youth, Terrance opened his laptop and got back to editing. Soon Terrance had all but forgotten about the boys as he was sucked back into his work. That is, until his columns had been finished for the night. 

‚ÄúOh, you're still here,‚Äù Terrance said with a start. Glancing at the mantle he saw that it was nearly four. 

‚ÄúHadn't you all better be going? Surely your parents will be worried if you don't come home soon.‚Äù 

The boys all continued staring into the smoldering flames as the same boy spoke once more, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt go home yet, he won't let us.‚Äù

Terrance grew concerned, he hadn't seen anyone out in the street following the boys had he? 

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by ‚Äòhe won‚Äôt let you‚Äô, is someone causing you boys trouble?‚Äù
The Boys‚Äô eyes stayed glued to the fireplace, emotionless and unblinking. As the leader spoke again, ‚ÄúHe said we live here now.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúMaybe this is some kind of internet prank,‚Äù Terrance thought to himself, ‚Äúbut it's quite a long con, my friends and I wouldn't have been able to keep an act like this up for this long, and something about these boys just feels off‚Äù. 

Terrence snapped back to reality, ‚ÄúWell whatever ‚Äòhe‚Äô said, you don't live here and you‚Äôd better be on your way, so I'll take these dishes to the kitchen and then I‚Äôll be seeing you boys off. ‚Äú

Terrance pondered the odd circumstances as he walked the plate of empty mugs to the kitchen. Could these boys really be playing a prank on him? Had they asked their way into his home to steal something from him? Were these boys really just lost in the snow in their own neighborhood? Suddenly the boys‚Äô original story was sounding a bit suspicious.

Terrance had no time to think any further though, when he looked up he found himself not in his kitchen but in his second-floor office. Understandably confused Terrance turned around not to see his second-floor hallway and his bedroom, but the stairs leading up from his basement cellar. Terrence set down the tray and drew the subcompact pistol he had not wanted to remove in the presence of the boys. 

Terrance immediately suspected himself to be in a nightmare and that this dream would soon end and lead into another where he was at an amusement park with all of his high school exes or some similar absurdity.

However as Terrence continued up the steps and through several other rooms out of order, he slowly began to realize that he was far too in control of himself to be in a dream. Soon Terrence found himself back in the living room, with the boys standing in a half circle, facing him as he entered. 

‚ÄúAlright, I'm getting pretty tired of whatever this is and I'd like for it to all end now. Please just get out of my house.‚Äù

The tall one in the back was the one to speak this time, ‚ÄúWhy? Don't you feel safe? We feel very safe here.‚Äù

Terrence raised the pistol in his hand and pointed it at the tall boy, ‚ÄúAll right, that‚Äôs it, everybody out, y‚Äôall are being freaky as hell. And for your information, asking if I feel safe in my own home is a good way to make someone feel very not safe in their home.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not very nice.‚Äù whispered one of the boys in the corner. Terrance turned to point the gun at him. 

‚ÄúAbusing someone‚Äôs hospitality isn't very nice either, so how about you all leave, and we call it even.‚Äù

Terrance caught a glimpse of something moving in the reflection off the grandfather clock behind the boys. He thought it looked like his grandmother for a brief moment before he felt a gentle hand on his shoulder. This caused Terrence to make his second mistake of the night. 

The feeling on his shoulder startled Terrence so much that he jerked the trigger of the Sig in his hand, launching a bullet directly into the face of the boy in front of him. 

A spray of sawdust trailed behind the boy's head as he fell to the ground. The others turned to watch him fall, stared for a moment, then slowly turned back to face Terrence as the boy sat up and stared along with them. The lights flickered and Terrence felt a chill as the boys kept staring for what felt like an eternity. 

In unison, they calmly stated, ‚ÄúYou shouldn't have done that‚Äù.

Terrence turned to run and immediately found himself waist-deep in a swamp. In a rush, the smell of stagnant water flooded his nostrils. Terrence choked on the sudden humidity and had to keep himself from gagging.

As Terrence whirled to leave the way he came, he froze. In the distance, he saw his grandmother walk away behind a tree.
‚ÄúGrandma! What is this place?‚Äù he called after her. But she did not respond. 

Through the buzzing of the flies circling his head Terence thought he heard a voice on the wind, beckoning him deeper into the swamp. As fast as Terrence splashed through the swamp his grandmother was always beyond the next tree, until Terrence came to a clearing where he saw his grandmother‚Äôs silhouette through the fog.

He waded toward her, not slowing even as the silhouette grew and began to tower over him.

Mississippi, and just a few more into the southern tip of the Appalachians, there‚Äôs a town.

It‚Äôs small‚Äî one of those ‚Äúblink-and-you‚Äôll-miss-it‚Äù type places. But if you blink and you
miss it, don‚Äôt worry. Just drive a few more miles into the woods and you‚Äôll see a diner. It‚Äôs
old as shit and right next to the road. You can‚Äôt miss it.

Literally, you *can‚Äôt miss it*.

If you do, then you‚Äôll wind up at the old warehouse at the end. The religious group in the woods likes to use it for it for their bimonthly celebrations, and going there isn‚Äôt really a good option.

The diner, though, is almost always open. (The only time it‚Äôs ever closed was that one time
a tornado came through. And even then, people were still able to get food from the back
window.) So it‚Äôs the best place to stop by if you get lost.

And if you were to go by and pop in, you‚Äôd probably get just about what you‚Äôd expect from
any old country diner. It‚Äôs about the size of a short, double wide trailer. So, the interior is a
bit claustrophobic, but just spacious enough that you won‚Äôt feel trapped. It has a unique‚Ä¶smell‚Äî like cigarette smoke and floral perfume had some fucked-up love child and decided it needed to die there.

There‚Äôs an open kitchen, with grease-stained utilities that haven‚Äôt been updated since poodle skirts were a thing, and coffee pots that look like they survived Chernobyl.

The checkered linoleum floors are cracked and stained in some places. Sometimes when it rains, a mysterious brownish liquid‚Äî that smells like pennies ‚Äîoozes from them and forms shapes similar to human footprints. A jukebox, riddled with bullet holes, sits next to
the bathroom hallway (Sometimes it ‚Äúglitches‚Äù and the screams of, what I can only assume are, the damned come from it (Usually, it has to be unplugged for a few minutes whenever that happens.) and plays country music and the occasional pop or rock song.

I‚Äôm not one hundred percent sure, but I think the health inspector is either sleeping with the
owners‚Äô daughter or has brain damage or (who knows) maybe it‚Äôs both. Like, this guy will
straight up look at the weird black goop stuff in the mop station and be like, ‚ÄúYeah, this is okay.‚Äù It‚Äôs shady as fuck, but if there‚Äôs one thing we can count on, it‚Äôs that he‚Äôll sign off on this shit hole as being ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù like, pretty much no matter what.

If you find yourself needing to go number one or two (or three) after a meal or just in general, then you may find a hot dog on the floor next to the toilet paper rack. 

Its appearance in one of the two bathrooms depends entirely on what day of the week it is,
though. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, it will be in the men‚Äôs room. But on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, it will be in the women‚Äôs room. It‚Äôs absent on Saturdays. And while we highly suggest against its consumption, we cannot control what you do.
Having said that, the people who have eaten it claim it allowed them to have seen into the future for a few hours. Others became violently ill (just as we predicted they would), and were doomed to spend their evening in the very room they consumed the forsaken cylinder
of meat in.

If you do stop by, don‚Äôt be a stranger! I live out back, am pretty much always on the clock, and I‚Äôm more than happy to take your order or sit and chat or both! I‚Äôm bored as fuck and my current coworker, Kurt, isn‚Äôt a very good conversationalist. And there isn‚Äôt any phone service or internet at the diner. So, if you have any important calls to make, you‚Äôll have to go out to the edge of the parking lot. Or you can use the old phone booth! It‚Äôs pretty much in the same place. It‚Äôs next to the only streetlight we have out here, so it‚Äôs pretty hard to miss. Do be careful if you ever have to use it, though. We have the occasional hobo or crazy person come out of the woods to try and ‚Äúphone home.‚Äù They can get pretty violent, and as much as I‚Äôd like the show, I‚Äôm supposed to treat the parking lot fights as though they were happening in-store. The owners put that rule in place, and they review the cameras to make sure we break them up. And while I was given a large walking stick to help, I really don‚Äôt want to deal with anymore violence than I already have to.

On the odd occasion that I‚Äôm not there, but you still want to chat with someone. Then I
highly suggest that you be cautious with the locals. Some of them are lovely people, don‚Äôt
get me wrong. I‚Äôd just rather not leave any of my co‚Äôs to deal with a fight, should one break out. Because, while Southern hospitality is a given with most of our regulars, it can still‚Ä¶run a bit short, if you know what I mean.

If you go in the mornings you may meet a fair bit of them, like Mr. Stimson, an older man
who usually comes between the hours of seven and nine AM to order a few cups of coffee
and a gravy biscuit. He used to own the old scrap yard. And despite there not being any big
wild cats native to this area and the nearest zoo not housing any, he will tell you all about
how his dogs were snatched, one at a time, by a black panther. Never mind the fact that
he‚Äôs only ever had but one dog. (It‚Äôs very sweet and follows him like a little shadow.
Sometimes he brings it to the diner.)

Mr. Canterbury, he always gets the morning special that comes with one waffle, two eggs,
and a side of bacon or sausage. But he gets the bacon instead of the sausage, because he
claims that it ‚Äútaste too much like human flesh.‚Äù (I can assure you now, that the sausage is
not made of flesh. We‚Äôre not sure where it comes from, but the owners assured us that we
weren‚Äôt eating living people.)

Ms. Cleo Janice comes in late in the afternoon and orders exactly one egg, a thing of cheesy
hash browns, and a strawberry milkshake. She always says that Tomila is ‚Äúcrying‚Äù and that
the mannequin is ‚Äúsick.‚Äù I think she may be projecting her feelings and trying to ask for
some form of help. But the last time I just up and asked if she needed any, she had what I
can only call, a nervous breakdown. Where she proceeded to take one of her boobs out and
play with it in front of me, all the while insisting that it was *Tomila* that was needing help. I‚Äôve considered banning her from the diner, but she tips, like, really good. So, I just keep my mouth shut and give her what she orders.

Then there‚Äôs Mr. Johnson. He doesn‚Äôt really have a usual meal, insisting that we should
‚Äúsurprise‚Äù him and give him whatever. However, he always refuses to drink water. He claimed it had made him unable to eat fish. As every time he saw one, it apparently had his late wife‚Äôs face and would *‚Äúbeg him to stop‚Äù* or *‚Äúlet go‚Äù* with her voice.

If you have questions, then so do I. But unfortunately for the both of us, they will forever go unanswered. Because Mr. Johnson, the slippery bastard that he was, died. They found his face nailed to his kitchen table a few months ago, with his skinless body out by Muffler‚Äôs dam.

The local police are still trying to find both the rest of his skin and who did it.

But to sum it all up, the diner‚Äôs weird as fuck, but it‚Äôs become a major part of my life. So, I
figured I‚Äôd start sharing a few of my experiences with y‚Äôall.",1,1760504242.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been on Zep since April and have lost 36 pounds so far. I started my 7.5mg dose five weeks ago because I stalled for over a month on 5. I‚Äôve been doing fine on 7.5 in that my weight loss began moving again (although the last 2 weeks I‚Äôve barely lost a pound). 

Starting last week (so a month after beginning 7.5) I started getting awful food aversions, especially the first 2-3 days after my shot. (FWIW I craved salt on 5 mg, which was weird.) Right now I‚Äôm sitting next to a lemon chicken/spinach pasta dish I made, of which I could only eat about half of (maybe). Right now the smell is making me nauseous. Most foods either sound gross to me or nothing appeals. I‚Äôm getting calories in for the most part, but it‚Äôs a struggle and everything feels gross. So far things I‚Äôve been okay with have been oatmeal, tuna, turkey bacon, dragon fruit, and coffee. Tonight my husband was a little concerned that I‚Äôm not eating enough.

Any excuses shes out giving is just major cope. At least most of the women if not all, wants her man/family/friends to make her feel special on her birthday. It‚Äôs once in a year occurrence and every one wants that day to be memorable. 

Again it does not need to be any thing extravagant but At least put some minimal effort into it Larry? Getting her flowers? Im sure tats cute but tats what some guys do on regular days. 

Even a basic gesture like making her coffee, decorating the table for her, getting her a book, heck even a handwritten letter or card would be appreciated at this point. He doesn‚Äôt need to cook, but just help her out in the kitchen cant you do that? Why not include Liam into this and you both can plan a small surprise and give it to Mindy? Some handwritten note from Liam(i still don‚Äôt know if he can do that) but still. Something, any thing!! 

Instead he literally lets her make her own birthday cake, and makes a guest appearance for dinner in her vlog. Tats all he does!! And the table looks plain and the whole set up looks gloomy. No brightening it up with flowers or candles!! 

Not a fan of Mindy, but every one deserves to have a nice birthday. And Mindy inspite of having a husband, a family and 2 kids still manages to have a lame birthday, even though most of it is her own fault.

I have insomnia again. I‚Äôm not sure if I will fall back asleep after I write this or not. My favorite painter is Edward Hopper. His most famous painting is ‚ÄúNighthawks‚Äù. I have a print of it that hangs on my wall next to my dining room table. Sometimes, I envision myself sipping my coffee next to those solitary figures in the painting. I suppose this evening/morning is one of those times. 

A bit about me. I posses an odd intense demeanor. I‚Äôm stoic on the outside, but I have a rich inner life. I find comfort in strange, pessimistic writings. E.M. Cioran once wrote ‚Äúif we could see ourselves as others see us, we would vanish on the spot‚Äù. It‚Äôs a comforting thought for someone who can be a bit self conscious. I also love studying history because it liberates us from the immediate hellscape in which we live. As Milan Kundera wrote, ‚Äúthe struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting‚Äù. Yet, I‚Äôm very emphatic, I try to be kind, and I‚Äôm quiet. Until, of course, I get to know you, then I might not shut up. Kurt Vonnegut described my approach to life best when he wrote, ‚Äú‚Ä¶there‚Äôs only one rule: goddamn it, you have to be kind‚Äù. I‚Äôve spent some time, lately, trying to figure out how to preserve that kindness when just living being wants to erode it. 

I‚Äôm drawn to music with deeper lyrics. Leonard Cohen, Cloud Cult, Bright Eyes, the National, Okkervil River, Phoebe Bridgers, and the Mountain Goats are among my favorites. And I will quote liberally from these bands. I love to read and I‚Äôm currently reading ‚ÄúLife and Fate‚Äù. Anton Chekhov, Raymond Carver, Milan Kundera, Chris Hedges, E.M. Cioran, and Frank Kafka are some of my favorite writers. I love watching cerebral and absurd films. Ingmar Bergman especially captures my inner struggles. Michelangelo Antonioni, Charlie Kauffman (I love ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Thinking of Ending Things‚Äù and ‚ÄúSynecdoche, New York‚Äù), Wes Anderson, and the Coen brothers are some of my favorite filmmakers. 

I‚Äôm excited fall is finally here. I love long walks among the changing leaves. Especially when the air is crisp and a hint of frost is present. I also survive by writing poetry and I dabble in short stories. Physically, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù. I have brown hair and bluish green eyes. I have an average body type. It‚Äôs always hard for me to describe my physical appearance, so I‚Äôm happy to exchange SFW pictures once we are both comfortable. 

If anything I wrote intrigued you at all, I would love to get to know you. Here are some ice breakers, but don‚Äôt feel compelled to answer them. What is the last song that made you cry? Who are your favorite filmmakers? Is there a philosopher who changed the way you look at existence? Is there a piece of art you still think about long after you first saw it? 

I‚Äôm ultimately looking for my person, but I know it takes time. Regardless of whether I hear from you, I hope you find your person. I know how lonely this process can feel.

Thus for anyone who wants to preserve their oral health and prevent fillings, you might look into giving up sugar in your drinks, switching to artificial sweeteners if necessary.

The mechanism by which sugar erodes tooth enamel is this:

Sugar does not directly damage tooth enamel, but sugar feeds the bacteria which live on your teeth in dental plaque, and these bacteria secrete acids as they metabolise the sugar. It is the acids secreted by oral bacteria which corrode and dissolve tooth enamel, leading to dental carries.

For those who sip coffee or tea all day long at your workplace, if these drinks contain sugar, you will be constantly bathing your teeth in a sugary solution, leading to a lot of bacterial acid production.

This is my first time posting on reddit so I hope you guys won't mind if it's a bit long or it feels like I over explain or if it's a bit TMI. Let me know if there's parts that seemed skipped. A lot has happened and I'm trying to summarize it as best as I can. It also might seem like a rant. English is also not my first language so I hope you guys understand. Also, he is not my boyfriend. Sorry for the title mistake. We were exclusively dating for 8months. 

I (22F) ended things with him (24M) because I think he's emotionally immature. So I am on my last year of uni. One of the things on my bucket list is to actually go on a date with someone before I graduate. Since my course is pretty demanding, I didn't really venture much in the romantic aspects. 8 months ago, I randomly decided to download a dating app. Despite my lack of dating experience, I didn't think it was bad idea. One date and if it didn't work out then it would be fine, right? I matched with this guy and we immediately clicked. It's been years since I felt this kind of attraction with someone. We started talking until late in the morning and he did ask me if I had any guy best friends to which I said no. I do have guy friends and we do talk and hangout but that's about it. There's no flirting or hugs. After, he finally asked me out on a date. At first, I had to decline because I have a beach trip with my friends (which consisted of 3 guys, 7 girls.). One was taken, 1 is gay, 1 swings both ways. When I went back home, he asked me again to go on a date with him to which I agreed. It was pretty awkward at first, I didn't know how to act but the date went well. I really really liked him. He was a gentleman, funny, and gave me flowers. As someone who is slow to open up and grew up in a culture where it's better to get to know each other first before actually doing any couple stuff, I told him that I would prefer if we take things slow. Get to know each other first and also meet some of my friends so you can see how I am outside our relationship.

**A few weeks of talking...**

We continued to see each other after and he would visit my uni from time to time. He asked how many guys liked me before or tried to at least court me. I was pretty honest. I said that there are a total of 3 during my years in college. The first guy, let's name him Mark, was a good friend of mine and part of my friend group during the initial two years of uni. He confessed and asked me out but I declined. We agreed to stay as friends and our friendship didn't really change after. Next guy is named Koko, he was a friend of my best friend's boyfriend who also became her friend. She introduced me to him last year since I would usually visit my best friend during her class hours. Koko and I would usually talk about random stuffs that interests us and sometimes suggest different places that has the best coffee, food, etc. Around January, he admitted that he used to like me but that feeling has long faded. I just said ""okay thanks"" and we moved on to our next topic. Lastly, an org mate named Rocco, kept on hitting me up and asking me out on a date. I would always decline and keep our relationship professional.

After he heard all of this. He said that it seems like I am leading them on with the two guys. I disagreed and said that we started as friends first so its easier to just act normal around these stuffs. I think leading them on would mean that I didn't give them a clear answer but I did. I do not constantly talk with Mark and Koko, only when there is related school works, House of the Dragon content, or books (for Mark), and music recommendations, cars that he'd like to share, or places he would go on abroad (architectures) (for Koko). I am pretty open with him and both Mark and Koko knows I am seeing him. I do not mind showing him our chats because again, I don't think there's nothing wrong with it.

**But cue to a month of talking**,

He said that he feels uncomfortable that I am friends with them. To him, it seems like they were my guy best friends and he's jealous. I assured him that I have my boundaries with them. I do not chat with them everyday or hangout with them now. Everyone is busy nowadays. He said that Koko sending a spotify song to me and chatting ""Also, here's a song I thought you'd like"" is flirting. Again, I told him that him sending a spotify playlist was because of me. Koko is well-versed in music and as someone who has a hard time exploring different genres, I asked him to send me some playlist he thinks I would like. He didn't buy that and that created a lot of tension the past few days which he proposed that he would not pursue me anymore if I keep ""entertaining"" Mark and Koko. I declined at first and said they were my friends, he said that my reply means that I prioritize my guy friends over my future partner. At the end, I agreed to stop talking with them.

I admit that I am completely in the wrong. After agreeing to not speak with them again, I started to secretly reply to them. I did not flirt with them, nor did they but morally, what I did technically breached his trust. He caught me multiple times and I would always ask for forgiveness. He would look at our chats and say that I am such a flirt. Our chat just consisted of Koko sending a car pic from a carshow, I then replied ""Will your family buy a new car?"". Those are like the vibes of our chats. Mark on the other hand, asked me if I wanted to see a movie. I was completely thrown off there and didn't reply to him at all when he said that.

Another thing, he did let me know that someone from the dating app (this was when we only talked for like a day and haven't gone on a date) scouted him and asked him to join a dating show. Honestly I do not know what to feel. He was saying he was doing it for the money and I didn't want to feel guilty so I agreed to it. As long as he kept it professional and received the money, that's okay. (Conclusion: he posted a story on all of his social media, posted a picture of him and the girl on his instagram,and followed the girl. He didn't talk to the girl at all after the event but that made me sick to my stomach.)

**Two months of talking...**

We stopped talking for about a week (I thought we ended thing) and I went back to talking with Koko (not consistently). I didn't tell him any fights about our relationship and the talks just consisted of superficial stuff. He reached out me again, wanting to get back, but as soon as he heard that I talked with Koko again. He was so mad. He asked me if I'm the type of girl who can't seem to stop talking to a man. Summary of it all, he said that he'll agree to take me back if I (1) fuck him, (2) strip naked and he takes a video of it, (3) turn back time and not talk to Koko. I was begging him to give me some time to think because I am not comfortable doing any of that but he was pressuring me and counting down. In the end, I ended up agreeing to do number 2. It was humiliating to say the least. He said that he'll keep the video as leverage and if I talk to Koko again, he'll post it.

The next day, I went to class and a bit disassociated. I excused myself to go to our university's psychologist. I opened up everything to him. He forbids me to go eat with my friends after class (All of my classes ends at 9PM) because there are guys there, he would use words that doesn't relate to me at all (I'm touchy or super close with my guy friends, I can't seem to live my life without my guy friends, etc.), doesn't want me to hangout with my college friends because there are guys, and he wants that all of my time are spent on him. Even hanging out with my friends on the weekends, he would get mad that I'm not spending it on him. He would always say ""prioritize your partner over your friends"" as a way to justify everything. The psychologist immediately alarmed our guidance and I was immediately sent home with my parents informed. My dad and I went to the police station and said that I should file a case and sue. I was conflicted because he just graduated. Suing him and winning the case means he would end up in jail. I asked my dad if we can just talk to him and his parents and just request to seek therapy. My dad just agreed since he didn't want to push me away further. We spontaneously went to their house but his parents went out of town so my dad and I only talked to him. He apologized and also said that he does plan to delete it and it was all empty threat to make me believe and make sure that I won't be contacting Koko again. I told him to seek therapy and please tell your parents what you've done. We ended on good?? terms. (Spoiler alert: he didn't tell his parents and his parents thought my dad and I were rude to come in unannounced and scolded their son. I came across this information after a few months.)

After a few days, he contacted me and said he wants to meet up with me. I agreed even though my friends were adamant about it. He just dropped by my building and gave me a letter and a flower. The content of the letter basically said that he knows that what he did was wrong and I hope that I could forgive him, and maybe next time, we can meet when we're both mature.

During those few days, he has been messaging me and telling me that he wants to make it right and he would make it up to me. To just give him another chance but he also said to me that he deserved better?? A part of me loved him but a part of me just feels some sort of injustice. Despite my friends and family's disapproval, I risked it. I agreed to continue dating him again and to see if he would really prove himself.

**8 months of talking**

I'll summarize everything that has happened the past few months. To take accountability for what I did wrong on the first month. I blocked Mark and Koko, so he can have his peace of mind. I also made sure that when I agreed to something, I will go through with it. He voiced out that he is not comfortable that I would go to cafes near our uni with Baron for thesis work (we're individual thesis but we just like to talk about our work and help each other give criticisms.), I agreed to not meet up with him. Even if Baron would ask to go and do thesis work, I would decline. Honestly, I did not think Baron would be a threat to him because nobody assumes that he's straight.

His mom also made a comment at the dinner table when we were all eating. He was serving me food and she said something along the lines of ""Does she not know any housework? Why are you the one serving her? A woman should be the one serving the guy."" in front of his whole family. I was dealing with the stress of thesis, the trauma of what he did, and that comment didn't really made it better. He also didn't defend me, he just said ""She knows housework."" and ate. When we went to his room, I broke down and told him that he's such an asshole. He didn't think that not telling his parents would not have consequences. I would always get the short end of the stick. He was just apologizing and promised to tell them.

After he told his parents, his mom became more kinder and would always compliment me. I honestly don't know what to feel. I feel misunderstood, judged, and overall not accepted for the way I am.

I ended things with him a few days ago, despite taking accountability for what I did wrong, I did not see that with him. He grew inconsistent. He continued to pressure me with physical intimacy, constantly find some guy to be jealous of, find excuses to not go therapy (even saying that the reason I want him to go therapy is to allow me to hangout with guys) and would constantly make comments that I keep prioritizing my friends over him. He would always say that I have a lot of guy friends when that is clearly not the case. When a guy would go near me and make small talks during events, he would blame me for entertaining them even though it was just networking. When he started working, he also got drunk and his arms were hanging on the shoulders of two girls and went skiing with a girl. I got mad and he apologized and admitted it was wrong. But he would keep bringing up the past on how I lied and didn't keep with the agreement every time we were arguing, saying ""It's difficult that the girl you love is so close with men"". He also did a lot of things that crossed my boundary and disrespected me but I never did that to him.

When he was depressed, I cancelled last minute on my friends, bought him food and his favorite drink, and went to his house late at night to comfort him. When I was depressed because I was stressed from my thesis, upcoming qualifying exams, and attorney requirements (family land problems), what did he do? nothing. He would ragebait me even further. He would also make bad comments about my guy friends even though they were nothing but respectful, gentleman, and kind people. His best friend? A cheater. I didn't forbade him from seeing him because I know he had a life before me and I trust him that he won't follow or be influenced by his best friend's attitude.

I'm sorry if it feels my writing is all over the place. It just feels unfair that he demands so much from me. I am not showy with my affections? I adjusted. I open up really slow to new people? I adjusted it for him. He disrespected me multiple times? Therapy? Kept delaying. I forgave him. I feel like I made up for the things I did but he didn't.

I'd like to know your thoughts on the situation. I want to know different opinions so I can reflect better on what went wrong in this relationship. Thank you!!",3,1760502724.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

**Mood Spoiler:** >!rough for OOP but they'll be ok!<

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1mf4ojr/removed_by_moderator/)**: August 1, 2025 (recovered)** 

This happened a couple months back, but I saw a skit online that was scarily similar to what actually happened to me IRL.

For context, I‚Äôm a divorce attorney. Been practicing for about 8 years now, mostly family law stuff. Generally pretty routine work - people want to untangle their lives, I help them do it legally, everyone moves on.

Let‚Äôs flash back to last March‚Ä¶

I took on what seemed like a straightforward dissolution case. Client I‚Äôll call Dave - nice enough guy, been seperated from his wife for over a year, just wanted to make it official. Nothing complicated, decent retainer, figured we‚Äôd have it wrapped up in a few months. Dave seemed reasonable, not one of those vindictive types trying to burn everything down out of spite.

Around the same time, I‚Äôd been seeing this woman Sarah for a couple months. Met her at a coffee shop near my office, really hit it off. She mentioned going through a divorce but I didn‚Äôt pry - not exactly first date conversation, you know? She had a different last name from what was in my client files, so when I ran my conflict checks, nothing flagged.

Everything was going great with Sarah. Really great, actually. We were taking things slow but it was heading in a good direction‚Ä¶

Until we scheduled the first four-way settlement meeting.

I walk into the conference room with Dave, chatting about keeping things amicable, and there‚Äôs Sarah sitting across the table with her attorney.

I literally just stopped mid-sentence. My briefcase slipped right out of my hands and hit the floor with this loud thud. Sarah went completely white. Dave looked back and forth between us for what felt like an eternity, and I could see the exact moment it clicked for him.

‚ÄúAre you fucking serious right now?‚Äù he says. Not shouting, but definitely not pleased.

Sarah started tearing up. Her lawyer looked like he wanted to crawl under the table. I‚Äôm standing there feeling like the biggest moron in legal history.

Had to immediately excuse myself with Dave. Guy was understandably pissed. Started grilling me - how long had this been going on, did I know who she was, was this some kind of setup to screw him over. I‚Äôm trying to explain that I‚Äôd been dating his wife for a couple months without having any clue who she was. He didn‚Äôt buy it at first.

‚ÄúWhat kind of lawyer doesn‚Äôt ask basic questions?‚Äù he keeps saying. Had to pull out my intake notes to prove the name thing, show him how the conflict check works, basically convince an angry client that I‚Äôm incompetent rather than malicious.

Took about twenty minutes before he finally believed it was just spectacularly bad luck. Even then he‚Äôs shaking his head, muttering about how fucked up this whole situation is.

I explained I‚Äôd have to withdraw from his case and help him find new counsel. There‚Äôs no getting around it - I‚Äôve got a personal relationship with the opposing party, which makes it impossible for me to represent him properly.

By the end he‚Äôd calmed down enough to say ‚ÄúThis is the weirdest goddamn thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me.‚Äù Still wasn‚Äôt happy about starting over with a new lawyer, but he understood why it had to happen.

The paperwork was a nightmare. Had to file a motion to withdraw since we were already in litigation, transfer all his files, deal with refunding unused fees. Sarah and I didn‚Äôt speak for two weeks after that meeting - we were both mortified. Her attorney spent forever trying to convince himself this wasn‚Äôt some elaborate scheme.

Even though nobody intended for this to happen, it was still my screwup. Should have had better procedures to catch conflicts like this. Doesn‚Äôt matter that it was an accident - you mess up the conflict check, you deal with the consequences.

Dave texted me a few weeks later, but it wasn‚Äôt friendly. More like ‚Äúhope you realize this completely fucked up my timeline.‚Äù Can‚Äôt say I blame him.

And just to add insult to injury, my malpractice insurance premium went up when I had to report the conflict.

**TL;DR: Been dating a woman for months, then unknowingly took her husband‚Äôs divorce case. Found out during our first settlement meeting when we all ended up in the same room. Had to withdraw from representation, everyone was pissed, professional disaster all around.**

***OOP's Comment:***

Commenter: I mean you did waste a lot of his money on whatever time you spent that the new lawyer would have to redo...

Did you and Sarah at least continue dating afterwards?

>**OOP:** Highjacking top comment to answer some questions.  
Sarah used another name socially that Dave had not disclosed. Her file had her legal name. Our check didn‚Äôt catch it and I didn‚Äôt connect the dots. Her and I‚Äôs relationship was less emotionally involved to keep it brief.  
I‚Äôve been overworked and dealing with more than a full caseload. Yes I could‚Äôve done better at preventing this from happening. This was a major FU.  
On her end I don‚Äôt think she knew based on her reaction as well as her being a workaholic too. Pretty much all communication had been directly between me and her counsel.   
No her and I did not continue seeing each other for obvious reasons.  
Also, not a bot. Made a throwaway specifically so this would not be traced back to me or my firm.

*OOP commented on the reupload of his post:* 

>I don‚Äôt fault Dave at all. I was sleeping with his wife while representing him there‚Äôs no version of that where I‚Äôm the victim. It doesn‚Äôt matter that I didn‚Äôt know who she was at first. By the time I figured it out, the damage was already done.  
He had real things riding on that case - money, time, his business - and my withdrawal blew up his timeline. I can say it wasn‚Äôt intentional, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt wreck him. He had every right to hate me for it.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1o1g7ou/tifu_by_accidentally_becoming_my_clients_wifes/)**: October 8, 2025 (2 months later)**

So it‚Äôs been about seven months since the conference room incident, \[editor's note- since the incident, not OOP's OG post\] and people have been asking what happened. Short answer: it‚Äôs been a mess.

About three weeks after I withdrew from Dave‚Äôs case, I got called into a meeting with the senior partners. Three partners, our firm‚Äôs general counsel, and a rep from our malpractice carrier on video call. The managing partner slides a folder across the table. ‚ÄúOpposing counsel reported a conflict of interest issue to the state bar under Rule 8.3. We‚Äôve been notified of a disciplinary inquiry.‚Äù Fuck.

Dave‚Äôs new attorney filed the report. They don‚Äôt get to decide what happens - they just report potential violations and the bar takes it from there. I have to explain everything. How I met Sarah, how we‚Äôd been casually dating for a couple months, how she used a different name socially, how my conflict check on her legal name didn‚Äôt flag anything because I never connected the dots.

The general counsel is taking notes. ‚ÄúWalk me through your conflict check process.‚Äù I explain the intake procedures, how the system works, how Sarah‚Äôs legal surname didn‚Äôt match what she‚Äôd told me. It sounds worse when I say it out loud.

‚ÄúThis is a clear Model Rule 1.7(a)(2) issue - material limitation conflict,‚Äù the general counsel says. ‚ÄúYou were correct to withdraw under Rule 1.16, but we need to understand how this wasn‚Äôt caught earlier.‚Äù The malpractice carrier rep unmutes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need to document this as a circumstance that could lead to a claim. It‚Äôll be noted when your policy comes up for renewal.‚Äù Great.

The firm mandates that I complete an eight-hour CLE on conflicts of interest before taking any new client intakes. They‚Äôve already registered me for a seminar that Saturday. Eight AM, of course. I show up at a hotel conference room with about twenty other attorneys. One of the instructors is Patricia, a divorce attorney I‚Äôve opposed a few times. She definitely knows why I‚Äôm there based on the look she gave me.

Most of the morning is standard material - rules, case law, procedures. Then we get to case studies and Patricia brings up In re Johnson, a 2019 disciplinary matter. Attorney representing a divorce client starts dating someone, turns out to be the opposing party, discovers it at a settlement conference. Same exact situation as mine from six years ago in a different state, and I wanted to sink through the floor. At lunch, another attorney mentions he heard about something similar happening ‚Äúat a firm in town recently.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs me, but clearly the story‚Äôs getting around.

I finish the seminar, pass the exam, bring the certificate back to the firm. A few weeks later, the bar sends a letter. The inquiry is closed with a private caution - basically a warning that stays in their files but isn‚Äôt public discipline. Could‚Äôve been worse. My malpractice premium went up about 15% when it renewed in September. The carrier cited the ‚Äúreported disciplinary circumstance‚Äù in the renewal letter.

The firm implemented some new procedures for me specifically. For the next six months, I have to get conflicts pre-cleared by the general counsel before taking on any new client. They also added mandatory AKA/nickname fields to our intake forms and conflict check system.

The worst part isn‚Äôt the official stuff though. It‚Äôs that people know. Not everyone, but enough. I‚Äôve been called ‚Äúthe coffee shop lawyer‚Äù twice at bar events. Last month opposing counsel asked if I‚Äôd ‚Äúmet the other party before‚Äù with this look on her face. The story‚Äôs definitely circulating. Some versions have me engaged to Sarah. One has me not finding out until trial. It‚Äôs becoming one of those cautionary tales people tell each other.

Haven‚Äôt dated anyone since March. Deleted the apps. Before I did, I matched with someone who mentioned her divorce and I immediately asked who her lawyer was. She unmatched pretty quick. Can‚Äôt really blame her.

Dave, if you see this - I‚Äôm sorry, man. I really didn‚Äôt know. I hope things worked out okay for you.

Sarah - hope you‚Äôre doing well.

Everyone else - just ask the basic questions. Run proper conflict checks. Verify AKAs. It‚Äôs not worth it.

TL;DR: Opposing counsel reported the conflict to the bar under Rule 8.3, firm made me do mandatory CLE, inquiry closed with a private caution, malpractice premium went up 15%, now I need pre-clearance on new clients and the firm added AKA fields to our system. Story spread around the local legal community, got a nickname, haven‚Äôt dated since. Officially just a caution, but reputation took a real hit.

***Top Comments:*** 

**theijo:** Thanks for the update. Honestly, speaking from my non-lawyer brain, I think you really drew the shittiest hand.

I don't think it's your fault and that you took the right steps when you found out.

I hope this will turn into a funny story soon. I was already routing for you after your first post.

I dont think this says ANYTHING about your skills as a lawyer.

**suaveSavior:** I work for lawyers and its such a small community, even in a big city. I, without ever asking or digging, know so much dirt on so many lawyers. I know whos had the mental breakdowns, who's been to rehab (and for what), who got arrested for soliciting underage prostitutes, who knocked up their secretaries, who shot himself with a fellow lawyers gun...

And thats just the first few off the top of my head and doesn't even include the dirt I know about attorneys Ive actually worked for.

Man, I feel for you.... but in a few years time, it'll feel more like mythology and less like a ghost haunting you.

>**jcrc:** I‚Äôm a paralegal and this is so true. If I heard this story about an attorney I knew I wouldn‚Äôt think less of him. Attorneys daring their staff, taking sexual favors as payment, skimming from trust accounts‚Ä¶that stuff is way worse.

**PossibleLettuce42:** Man, I don't know how long you've been an attorney but discipline cases get so, so much worse than this. Stop beating yourself up. First, it was not intentional or through some incredibly basic neglect, basic conflict checks were done and just didn't ring an alarm bell. Second, you immediately did the right things once you realized. Third, you've paid your price, man. You've done your stupid all-day CLE, all these new procedures, paid the new premiums, taken the small and temporary reputation hit...man, you've¬†*been*¬†penalized. Stop adding more time on to your sentence.

There was a local attorney who was OPENLY DATING clients, in lieu of payment, MULTIPLE TIMES and it still took two years before he was finally suspended.

You got zinged with a rare circumstance that let you fine-tune your conflict checks and learn a valuable lesson. You're not a fly-by-night garbage attorney. I have more experience as prosecution, but I've done enough defense work in my private practice years to give you the advice I've given self-flagellating clients: guilt and shame are constructive,¬†*to a point*. Once you've already made amends and done your time, you're benefitting nobody by beating yourself up more.",494,1760502468.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,67,0.95,False

(Delayed delivery scam),"I regularly order certain household items and essentials from Amazon, because it‚Äôs cheaper than Walmart (at least in my area of the world): shampoo and toiletries, but importantly: coffee and diapers. 

And they have repeatedly tested me. They will absolutely try to get you to cancel your order if they think you would pay a higher price. 

Two examples: 

FIRST EXAMPLE; I did a subscribe-and-save for coffee. It was $10.98 per 32oz every two weeks (looking at grocery store prices, that is extremely cheap). I got my first two deliveries no issues. Third delivery: ‚ÄúYour order is delayed. We will let you know when the product is available.‚Äù

I looked up that brand of coffee, 32oz bag of the same variety. It was listed at $14.98. No mention that ‚ÄúThis product may not be available.‚Äù They just wanted me to pay $4 more.  I didn‚Äôt cancel, waited 3 days and suddenly my coffee was delivered at the agreed upon $10.98

SECOND EXAMPLE: Diapers. My son is a toddler with a big ole fat belly that only the Pampers 360 can contain. 

I ordered a pack of 96 diapers at $39 and some change, expecting two-day delivery. The day of expected delivery, I got a notification that my delivery would be delayed for two weeks. I looked up Pampers 360 Size 6 on the Amazon app and the only comparable option was an 80count for $41. So 16 diapers less for $2 more. 

I did not cancel. I went to the dollar store and got some to hold out. And what showed up this morning? A full 12 days before the *expected* delivery? A pack of 96 diapers for $39. 

Amazon has essentials for cheap, but do not let them swindle you. Hold out.
