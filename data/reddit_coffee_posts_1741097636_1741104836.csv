1j3eap2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowthHacking/comments/1j3eap2/boring_startup_industries_but_always_printing_cash/,"Boring startup industries, but always printing cash","I spent several months researching the most lucrative industries that print money.

From adult entertainment to waste management, I'm sharing my findings on the [8 sectors that thrive regardless of economic trends](https://www.setproduct.com/blog/startup-niches-always-money-printing).

No hype, just data. So, lezgo!

Years of navigating startup trenches taught one hard truth: chasing trends burns cash faster than a wildfire. The real gold lies in industries rooted in primal human needs!

# Men’s lust (The unspoken economy)

The adult entertainment sector isn’t just surviving — it’s thriving, quietly generating billions through platforms like OnlyFans and niche subscription models.

Early mornings spent analyzing traffic patterns revealed a key insight: anonymity and accessibility drive this market.

**Pros** include recurring revenue models and low barrier to entry for creators.

**Cons?** Regulatory landmines and societal stigma that can suffocate scaling efforts.

# Women’s beauty (The eternal cash machine)

Observing market shifts revealed an uncomfortable truth: insecurities monetize better than ideals.

Skincare and fast fashion dominate not through quality, but through relentless psychological triggers.

**Pros**: evergreen demand, viral marketing potential.

**Cons**: cutthroat competition and inventory nightmares that’ve bankrupted many optimistic founders.

# Elderly health (The gray gold rush)

Three years spent shadowing homecare startups exposed a harsh reality: aging populations create endless opportunities.

From telehealth to mobility aids, this sector rewards patience.

**Pros**: recession-proof demand, government contracts.

**Cons**: regulatory mazes and operational complexities that turn hair gray faster than you’d imagine.

# Children education (Selling hope to desperate parents)

Tutoring centers in affluent suburbs taught more about human nature than any MBA program.

Fear-driven spending on coding bootcamps and Ivy League prep courses isn’t slowing — it’s mutating.

**Pros**: premium pricing power, emotional customer loyalty.

**Cons**: credential wars and an arms race against AI tutors.

# Wealth management (Playing on paranoia)

Coffee-fueled interviews with private bankers uncovered the dirty secret of high-net-worth clients: they’ll pay anything to avoid becoming “former rich.”

Family offices and crypto custody solutions now dominate this space.

**Pros**: astronomical lifetime customer value.

**Cons**: compliance hell and trust barriers thicker than vault doors.

# Get-rich-quick schemes (Exploiting desperation)

Undercover research in online guru communities revealed a dark truth: poverty breeds gullibility.

From forex courses to dropshipping PDFs, this industry preys on hope.

**Pros**: low overhead, viral scalability.

**Cons**: ethical quicksand and platforms that eventually pull the plug.

# Defense tech (War’s quiet profiteers)

Sleepless nights analyzing Ukraine conflict supply chains exposed an uncomfortable niche: drone startups and cybersecurity firms are printing money while avoiding headlines.

**Pros**: government contracts with margins that’d make SaaS founders weep.

**Cons**: moral dilemmas and clearance requirements that lock out casual players.

# Waste management (The unsexy frontier)

A landfill tour changed everything.

Behind the grime lies a $2 trillion industry hungry for tech disruption: smart bins, recycling robotics, ESG compliance tools.

**Pros**: monopolistic local contracts, zero glamour competition.

**Cons**: regulatory sludge and operational headaches that require steel nerves.

\* \* \*

**Bottom line for surviving the money game**

After burning through two failed ventures and one nervous breakdown, patterns emerged. 

**Do this:** Obsess over industries tied to fear, vanity, or survival; they outlive every trend. Ignore shiny objects. Web3 fads come and go, but Botox clinics stay packed.

Build moats through regulatory expertise or gritty operational mastery.

**Don’t do this:** Underestimate compliance costs in healthcare or defense. Overlook the psychological toll of monetizing despair.

Forget that even “immoral” industries require ethical guardrails.

Karma eventually collects.

Hope this help you to pivot!",1,1741104644.0,GrowthHacking,0,1.0,False

Últimamente me apetece conocer gente nueva fuera de mi grupo habitual, así que aquí estoy probando suerte en Reddit.

Tengo 28 años, gay y me flipa la fotografía analógica (a veces me gasto más en carretes de lo que debería), los videojuegos y descubrir cafeterías guapas. Soy bastante chill, me encanta hablar de todo un poco, soy bastante extrovertido así que me adapto fácil.

También disfruto de planes como salir a explorar pueblos, hacer fotos, gym, tomar un café sin prisa o incluso hacer un poco de teletrabajo en una cafetería . Llevo casi toda la vida en Alicante, aunque estuve un tiempo fuera por trabajo.

Ahora me apetece ampliar el círculo y conocer gente de mi edad mas o menos y hacer planes chulos, ir de cerves o lo que sea :) Si te ape, manda DM!

Heyy!  
Lately, I’ve been wanting to meet new people outside my usual group, so here I am giving Reddit a shot.

I’m 28, gay, and really into analog photography (sometimes I spend more on film than I should), video games, and discovering cool cafés. I’m pretty chill, love talking about anything and everything, and I’m quite outgoing, so I adapt easily.

I’m also into plans like exploring small towns, taking photos, hitting the gym, grabbing coffee without rushing, or even doing some remote work at a nice café. I’ve lived in Alicante most of my life, though I spent some time abroad for work.

Now I’d love to expand my circle and meet people around my age to do fun stuff—grab some beers, hang out, or whatever comes up :) If you’re down, send me a DM!

I’ve been going through Warcraft books lately and have reached Stormrage (you probably know where some of this is going).

The first issue is the lack of otherwise “mainline” books not having audio versions (at least not mainstream ones as far as I can tell). Cycle of Hatred is like the only thing between W3 and WoW and it doesn’t have an audio version, or the Warcraft 2 book prior to the dark portal whose name escapes me. 

There’s also nothing reliable for their short stories, something Games Workshop does for their 40K short stories is combine them into anthologies/collections and publish those as books and audiobooks.

Then there are the narrators. Their talent isn’t the problem is the overall decisions made with them. *Why* in God’s name does Christie Golden narrate all her books about *Orcs.* I like Christie and her work, and she does a really good Sylvanas and Jaina, but Thrall, Durotan, Grom, (and Arthas for that matter) are not vaguely British sounding women. This gets even more ridiculous when you consider Chris Metzen is RIGHT THERE.

Imagine my horror when after 5 books narrated by de Ocampo I get to Stormrage. How did they let this otherwise accomplished voice actor mispronounce *every single fucking name* in the book? Nobody stopped him 12 seconds in? Every single time I think I’ve come to grips with his performance they introduce somebody else for him to butcher. I had to take a break after “Crash-us.”

 AITA? So to give some context , me and my husband have been having a lot of issues lately. He disappears all the time and doesn’t come home at night. this most recent time he did not come home, I told him I was done. He came home the next day while I was in bed with our baby and he told me to get the fuck out and sleep on the couch with the baby, so I did. That pissed him off even more. He started screaming vulgar things at me all night long like how I’m a stupid hag, a shi**y mother, a piece of sh*t, and that his baby mama loves him more than I do. He said that he was gonna go out tomorrow and f*ck another girl. All well our baby and 13-year-old son were in the next room. The next morning at 6 AM he woke me up and kept screaming “ get the f*ck out, get the f*ck out, get the f*ck out of my house right now.” as I got up to take my son and leave he told me I needed to be out of the house before he got home from work. Mind you I have no car no money no food, nothing. I am a stay at home mother. I had recently gotten a message on Facebook from a man who claimed to be 60 and was willing to financially take care of me and all he had to do was meet me to get coffee. (I am a 24f & my husband is 35m) I decided to respond just to see if he was legit because I am now a single mother who was getting kicked out with my baby. He said he wanted to meet and I stopped responding because I’m honestly just not comfortable with going to meet some random man. My husband ended up texting me later that day saying he wanted to work things out and as stupid as it was, I decided to stay. I ended up telling him about how this man had reached out to me and I responded because I was under the impression I was getting kicked out out of the house with my son and now he’s claiming I cheated on him and has disappeared again.

Or wondering if you’d known about lipedema when you were younger, if there’d be a drastic difference in your life and appearance.
So I just wanted to say:
-- I’ve been a vegetarian for over a decade since my early teens, with a focus on low dairy/gluten and limited added sugar, salt, and non-processed foods for the last 3 years
-- I don't drink coffee or caffeinated teas and rarely consume any caffeine or sodas
-- I’ve never drank alcohol
-- I’ve never been on hormonal birth control
-- I’ve been doing sports/working out since I was a kid
-- My vanity comes out in self-care so I’m an incredibly moisturized human being

And I STILL have noticeable lipedema, especially in my thighs. Even when I’ve been borderline underweight with my whole sternum and ribcage popping out or rocking my 4 pack abs, my legs stay the same. And though progression is slow, through old pictures I can also still see it’s gotten a little worse as I age. 

What I will say is I never used to think much about my legs until I discovered lipedema. I’d think “huh they’re a little stocky and ouch they kinda hurt sometimes” but they let me run and play soccer and my mom had the same legs and never let them stop her from achieving anything she wanted to do. I was confident in who I was no matter my leg shape and I’m working on regaining that.

Now that I know about lipedema, I have the whole vibration plate, rebounder, dry brushing, gua sha, legs up on wall routine, but I shouldn’t feel like a failure if I’m too tired or don’t feel like doing that stuff all the time.

So please to all of you, give yourself a break sometimes and a pat on the back for what you can do. This condition isn’t something you did to yourself and please try your hardest to not let it stop you from enjoying life.",4,1741104265.0,lipedema,0,1.0,False

My son wouldn’t sleep for longer than 45 minutes at a time last night, I got 3 hours of sleep, and both kids woke up between 5:30-6am. I twisted my ankle last week and now it’s numb/tingly, can’t walk on it, and very painful but I can’t go to the doctor until Saturday when my husband has a day off. My daughter wanted smoothies this morning and spilled them all over our bed, couch, and carpet. My son is teething, has pinkeye, and has screamed/cried all morning because of the discomfort (and no availability with his pediatrician until tomorrow for the pinkeye)

I finally got him to sleep after an hour of screaming just for my daughter to have used her diaper and needed a change. So he’s back to screaming, being overtired, and cranky. Now our housing company randomly decided to do a housing inspection today right as my kids were going to sleep for a nap. So now I have an overtired, uncomfortable 6 month old and a cranky 2 year old as well. I also ordered coffee which the store got completely wrong and I woke up to all bottles and dishes dirty this morning (I always have to wash all the bottles and it’s incredibly frustrating) So I spent an hour washing all bottles, loading the dish washer, and preparing breakfast for my daughter. 

I’m just exhausted and frustrated today, it’s been a terrible day honestly and not getting any easier. I’m also in so much pain from my ankle I really just want to lay around and cry.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I have a very DIY gift that I've been preparing for her for some time now, but now I'm wondering if this is something too early or too much in the relationship to give her (no, it's not an engagement ring 😂). I'd really appreciate your thoughts and feelings on this.

***RELATIONSHIP CONTEXT***

We met in late May last year, and after months of flirtation, went on a date. We've been dating for a bit more than 4 months now. 

Currently, we're in a place where she's comfortable introducing me to third parties (e.g. her manicurist) as her boyfriend. While she was hesitant about relying on me with even small stuff like getting coffee for her at the start, now she's comfortable with relying on me to help with  really big stuff that can take years to deal with (and also coffee). Whereas we linked arms often during the earlier dates and most of the handholding was initiated by me, now she actively reaches down for my hand. She's said ILY a bunch of times (in a way which is lighthearted and that didn't seem entirely serious), and once quite seriously after she had a bit too much wine (she really felt like drinking that night) although she says she doesn't remember it happening. I've said it to her too, and I'm pretty sure that my actions speak louder than words (while on a work trip she says she forgot to bring her pajamas, and guess who gets a cute pajamas delivered to her at her hotel, rush delivery?). 

***THE GIFT***

Some time around 1.5 months of our dating, in the midst of our flirting, I told her that I think of her every day, and she laughed and said she didn't believe me. So, challenge accepted! I've been handwriting letters to her ***every single day*** since that day, and I've been putting them in a nice, durable box. 

Looking back at them, they chronicle our relationship and its progression, and also my thoughts, feelings and sometimes vulnerabilities, throughout this time. They address things like the promises I've made her and how I've fulfilled them, gratitude for the small things she does that I've noticed, and questions she's asked over our time together. Some are just a paragraph, and others are several pages long.  Some are lighthearted and funny, and others one could mistake as having been written by the Romantic poets themselves.

The letters show a development, at least on my part, from the deep romantic care I had for her when I began the process (when I avoided the ""love"" word entirely), to undeniable love (where I sometimes write things like ""I love you with all my being""). I was careful throughout the process to make sure I made no assumptions about her own feelings in the letters to avoid projecting anything on her.

There are about 70 letters in the box now, and it's close to full.

***THE TIMING***

She's finally going to be taking a few weeks off from work soon, which means she'll have time to read the letters. I'm thinking of giving the box to her during this time. When I give it to her, I also plan to make it abundantly clear that she doesn't need to respond, or even read them.

But now that the time has come, I'm wondering if receiving a gift like this in the current stage of our relationship would scare her or touch her. The last thing I want would be for her to break up with me over this.

So, my dear ISFJs, would you be comfortable receiving a gift like this if you were in a similar relationship stage to the one described above? What would your thoughts and feelings be? Would it make you happy? Would you think I'm crazy and break up with me?

I don’t currently drink coffee, but I’m a freak about doing things right and having all the proper equipment, so I’ll probably start drinking it just to hone my craft.

I made this post because I’m curious about what recommendations you all have. I’m sure there’s a best grinder or maybe some modified piece that takes espresso to the next level. I’d appreciate any tips and tricks for mastering the Breville Bambino. I can’t afford a more expensive machine, so that’s the one thing that won’t be changing, but I’m open to getting a grinder or other upgrades if necessary.",2,1741103859.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

* Lucha Libre show on Saturday
* Mercado Coyoacán
* Frida Kahlo Museum
* Museo Nacional de Antropología

Does anyone have any other recommendations? We are visiting from Toronto, Canada. Very into food, culture, reading, libraries, coffee, mezcal, museums. 

We are more into street food/market food vs. overpriced fancy places but definitely interested in going to nicer places if the food/culture is good and not just overhyped stuff for tiktok/insta.

I mostly use mokka pot for now ( you can hate me ) as I feel like its easy, fast, chill experience and strong taste. 

But what is the discussion here: first time I used K ultra I have put it to 6 as 6 is the middle point to start adjusting for Mokka but once I have put it to 6 I insantly received amazing balanced flavour from pretty medium-dark roast for espresso. 

I cant believe it is so simple to dial in as with my cheap grinder it was like 6-7 tries before a nice cup of coffee. 
How should I know if its correct setup or I should maybe try finer or a bit coarser? 

I know that K-ultra balances flavour for you and you can even play it out to have finer grind and still get up to 24% extraction for filter as an example. 
So basically according to the taste profile it was not bitter so no overextecting as its roast based on medium-dark or almoust dark roast, there were 0 acidity as its the most espresso roast I could find at specialty place,so I assume it is proper taste but should I try more finer to see the point where it gets bitter or should I try couple cups getting coarser and coarser. 
I just dont believe you can dial in from the box for the first use. 

Well I use some things such as weights and extra soft water to make mokka better and more consistent but it was always a pain to dial in and maintain the same quality. ",1,1741103380.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend just got his own car 3 days ago and has been enjoying having his own ride I was very happy for him. He also buys me an iced coffee everyday at dunkin donuts for the past few months. One day I decided to tag along with him and when he pulled up all the dunkin girls seem to know him and they all seemed to have conversations beyond coffee which I found odd. One girl was so happy to see him and he smiled and asked her where she has been. This upset me cause why do you care where she's been?. I felt like I didn't even exist at that moment. It's one thing to ask how's someone day is or hold the door open but to have a flirtatious conversation in front of me felt disrespectful. We argued and I gave him the silent treatment for 3 days. Now I dont think he's cheating on me specifically with the dunkin girls but I do think he's being a bit odd. I felt bad arguing with him so we made up, the same day I noticed he shaved his genital area which upset me again because the 8 years we have been together he has NEVER shaved even when I ASKED him to. When I asked him when he decided to shave he said 3 days ago. Coincidentally the day we argued and didnt tell me until today. I want to add I don't feel like I'm a very insecure person I don't check phones, I don't care when he watches porn , I don't care his facebook is filled with Instagram models with big ol' boob's and butt's. but to see him talk flirtatiously and smiling at another girl kinda got under my skin now all the sudden he's shaving and has his own car to do as he pleases.

I'll give it a shot 'cause why not? I'm a risk taker after all. I don't know what to put as my intro but how about a short story telling for a change?

My Mom once told me when I was a kid that I should never play with someones feelings. Especially when I'm in a commitment with someone. I grew up seeing her go through hardships and struggles, often crying because of the weight she carried. I witnessed all of this at a young age, and it left an impact on me. From that moment, I promised myself I’d love with sincerity and authenticity because I never wanted to see another woman go through that pain. Every person deserves to be loved fully and treated with the respect they deserve. A year ago, my mom also told me that love should never be begged for and love should be unconditional. It’s something that should come naturally, freely, and without hesitation. That stuck with me, and it’s how I approach love—not chasing, not pleading, but waiting for a genuine connection where both hearts are in the same place. So, I’m here, ready to build something real and meaningful with someone who values love, honesty, and genuine connection.

1j3dfm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j3dfm2/relationship_of_4yrs_ended/,Relationship of 4yrs ended,"
Hey y’all, first post on this subreddit and wanted to gain perspective and support for my situation. I 25M got dumped by my 24F gf of almost 4yrs. We started dating in college and this break up completely blindsided me. I’ll go through a timeline below.

We live about 1hr away and Jan 4th she says she’ll come over and we can have a date night. We met for coffee before the gym and in my car, she began to tell me somethings that bothered her that I have been guilty of. She mentioned some guilt tripping and score keeping which I have done and she has mentioned these things before. I have always thought these things were me trying to communicate her needs but I now realize I could have communicated these things in a different way. Nonetheless she is emotional and saying how she needs space and a break from the relationship to heal and she feels she lost herself and seeing some of her friends. I could tell she was hurt and I took it as she needed some distance and to start going to therapy.

The coming week, I reached out a couple times with supportive messages and reassurance. I also texted a few times to try and understand more specifics like what does a break mean or how long etc but she just kept saying she needed time and space. It was hard to stay away and I did my best to reduce the number of messages.

The following week we hop on a call and same thing she says some similar things that bothered her and then brought up the definition of love from the Bible.  She was again very emotional and hurt and I could tell that maybe this wasn’t just a break. I reached out to our mural friend and found out that she took this as a full breakup and does not want to get back together. There were some other things that happened years ago that I think she also never really forgave me for and they stuck around. This is when it all really started to hit me.

I was traveling for work at the time and my anxiety had already been so bad from not having many answers especially since these issues could be fixable. I called her 2 times in the next two days and we spoke for about an hour each and she really helped me because my anxiety was really bad. The following day I actually ended up going to a mental hospital outpatient clinic because I was physically shaking from the shock and anxiety. I let her know, which was probably not the best thing, but at the time I thought it was just to tell her I was getting the help I needed.

Next day she calls and tells me she is going to block me and remove me off all contact because she didn’t want the her decision to affect me and she thought I was going to commit suicide. I was not but I respected her decision. 

In the next few weeks, she made a pretty fucked up tiktok lip syncing the sound “I would check myself into a mental hospital, but I have better things to do”. I was honestly so shocked she did this because I never would have taken her as the person to even do that. She has also created a couple other tiktoks and reposted a bunch of relationship/single tiktok. I have stayed radio silent and not even posted anything on social media at all. 

Fast forward to today it’s been 6weeks and she has removed all our photos on social media and has not even reached out to just check on me. I’m trying to take it day by day and my anxiety has been getting a lot better since I have medication now.

This whole situation has been really weird to me. It’s crazy as well because we spoke about marriage and I even gave her a promise ring and it’s so odd to me that she never let me know how much these things were bothering her to having to exit the relationship. 
I understand I could have handled stuff better in the relationship like being more emotionally available and trying to compromise for stuff but that’s something we both could have worked on better. I did not have the resources I have now like there’s and tons of reading to tackle that stuff.

I don’t know where this will all head in the future but part of me still wants to repair the relationship. I understand I have to move on, yet I think I’m still holding on to that potential “what if” of working through these things in couples therapy. Many of my friends also say that I should move on and she’s showing her true colors now which I completely understand is true. I think I’m leaning more to letting go now but part of me still has some hope.

1j3dfbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/improv/comments/1j3dfbt/my_improv_brain/,My improv brain.,"Need a break from the news? This is my improv brain. What does your improv brain look like? Share it! Let's fill social media with art. Because art is the best form of protest.

Listen to the last thing that was said, and respond only with your heart. And good or bad, hearing them say it, is a relief to your soul. 

Your character needs to go through a change in the scene. They shouldn't be the same person that they were when you started. And the audience needs to see you experience that change. 

Emotions are the fuel that drive our scenes, and relationships are the highway they travel on. The best use of emotions is to have many in a scene. Just like real life, our characters can go from happy to sad to flirtatious, in rapid succession. 

Steal your scene partners line to make your own. It's the highest form of ""Yes, and...""

Take something the wrong way. Take an insult as a compliment. Take a compliment as an insult. If someone in a scene says something that means nothing like ""Bill, you always put cream in your coffee..."" start sobbing. We are not on that stage to do what's expected. 

Forms and games are great. But once you take the stage, be ok with them changing, be ok with them falling apart. YOU are the show people came to see. Not the form. Enjoy the show that's happening right now. The audience doesn't care about your form. They care about you. 

Stop fixing things. Once you fix whatever problem it is that people are going on about, the scene ends and you have to start all over. Instead, make the ""problem"" bigger. If the house is on fire, grab some gasoline and join in the chaos. 

Scenes are like songs. They are about ONE thing. And that thing usually is about feelings and love and relationships. Whatever big thing that happens in the beginning of the scene is usually what that scene is truly about. You can always return to that point anywhere in the scene or the scenes that come after it.  And if you feel that you are starting to invent in a scene, go back to that real moment. 

Remember your lines. If you say something that resonates with you. Repeat it. Say it three times and make each saying of it different. 

Say beautiful things. We only get 3 minutes to do a scene. Why would you not fill that short time with the most beautiful words you can think of? Be verbose! Let your janitor character speak with the tongue of a poet! Blind us with the beauty that is inside you.

Make eye contact. Check in with your partner. What does the distance between you say? How are they standing? Tall and proud? Hunched over with a worried face? How are you standing? How does all of this make you feel? Say that. Say it loud so the people in the back can hear you. 

Play. The game of the scene only can only happen when one of you finds something that you think is fun. When your scene partners notice you are having fun with something, they will naturally want to join in. That's how little kids play, one kid sees another kid playing in the sand box and joins in. That's the ""game"" of the scene. And if they don't join you? Your character are still having fun in the scene. 

Mirror your partner. If they are standing in a way that you can duplicate, do that. It not only creates a lovely scene picture, it connects you with them on a higher level. Move when they move. Mirrors duplicate an image but they also reverse it. If they are standing tall, go low. It establishes a dynamic that you can then break once your character decides to make a change and stand up. Which is then a perfect reflection again. 

Don't let the big things pass you by. If your scene partner says ""I need to talk..."" don't start doing a bit. Listen. Something big is about to happen. The audience never blinks, they see all. And when a player says a line that is honest and real, they notice. You need to notice it too, when something big happens in a scene, that's all the scene is about. Look into your partner's eyes and respond with your heart. 

Be okay with exiting the scene. It's a powerful move to know when to exit. It almost always raises the stake of any scene. But, it also gives your scene partners a moment without you, even if it means leaving someone alone on stage. We might learn their characters hopes and dreams. Then we can re-enter the scene more informed about them. And, if any one leaves the scene you're in, it's your duty to talk about them. That way they can be informed about how your character feels about them. 

Give great names! I try to give my scene partners epic names. I like to take a name that ends in a hard E sound and pair it with a mid 1970's American car. If you call someone ""Donny Cordoba"" chances are pretty good that person and everyone else in the scene is going to remember it. 

Being funny is a side effect of honesty. My wife and children will happily go into great detail about how un-funny I truly am. But, onstage, when I'm just making honest observations about how I feel, the audience thinks it's funny. Release yourself from the burden of being funny. Be honest and watch how the audience reacts. 

Love. Let your heart lead you in the scene. Fall in love. Get your heart broken. Be flirty. Be giggly. And be very loud about it. 

Your job is to make your scene partner look good. You are an expert at this skill. You are part of an elite team, your super power is the ability to raise your scene partner up.

I remember leaving the test center fully in tears and feeling defecated. I was convinced I've failed, only to find out later that I PASSED the NCLEX! I’m still processing it all, but I wanted to share this wild journey because I know there are so many nursing students out there who might be feeling the same way I did: LOL terrified, overwhelmed, and doubting every single answer they clicked😂😂. 
The journey to the NCLEX was brutal. Months of studying, flashcards littering my room, practice questions until my eyes blurred, and coffee sips as I was glued at my study corner. Horrible nights where I’d question if I was even cut out for this. I’ve heard all the horror stories....people saying it shut off at 85 questions and they failed, or it went all the way to 150 and they still didn’t know what to expect.... My friends who had already taken the NCLEX gave me the morale “you’ll be fine” prep talk, but deep down, I wasn’t so sure of the outcome. This exams has been my dream of becoming a USRN on the line.
Test day came, and I was anxious and terrified. I barely slept, my stomach was in knots, it made rumbling sounds that I've never heard before, and I triple-checked my ID and registration like my life depended on it. Walking into that test center felt like stepping into some kind of judgment zone. The silence was deafening, the computer screen staring me down like it was daring me to mess up. And then it started. Question after question, my brain scrambled to recall everything I had crammed and mastered. Maslow’s hierarchy, medication dosages, priority, delegation etc. “Did I misread that? Was that a trick? Oh no, I’m failing.” questions lingered in my mind.
The worst part? It shut off at 85 questions. Eighty-five! I heard that could mean anything FAIL or PASS and my mind immediately went to the darkest place. I sat there, frozen, as the screen went blank, convinced I've bombed it. I held it together just long enough to grab my stuff and stumble out to my car. Then came the tears. Full-on sobbing, ugly-cry tears. I called my mom, barely able to get the words out, telling her I was sure I've failed. She tried to calm me down, but I was spiraling thinking about retaking it, or how I will explain it to everyone.
I couldn’t even bring myself to do the Pearson Vue trick right away because I was too scared of seeing “bad news.” But after a few hours of wallowing (and maybe some stress-eating), I worked up the courage. Shaking, I logged in, paid the fee for quick results, and there it was: “PASSED.” Refreshed the page several times bc I couldn't believe what I'd just seen. PASSED. I screamed so loud my neighbor probably thought something was wrong! The relief hit me like a tidal wave, and honestly, I cried again this time out of pure joy and disbelief.
Looking back, I realize the NCLEX isn’t just a test of knowledge; it’s a test of resilience and patience. Itbis designed to push you to your limits and make you doubt yourself, but getting through it is proof you’ve got what it takes. To anyone out there prepping for it right now: I see you. I feel you. Those tears, that panic it’s all part of the process. But trust me, you’re stronger than you think, and when you see that “PASSED” on your screen, every second of stress will be worth it. 
So yeah, I cried leaving the test center, but I’m a nurse now. And I wouldn’t trade that moment or this victory for anything.

I used Naxlex QBank, Uworld and some bit of Bootcamp. Most questions in the NCLEX were vague to Naxlex.

I really love him and I think he also loves me - he is 3 year 8 months younger to me and thus I feel might have some immaturity. He also had some family issues. But in general when he is happy I love him and the time I spend with him. I earn well so I do spend a lot on us and we have a lot of fun.
Last year in March I found him using grindr and confirmed him. He told me he just moved to a new city and needed a few friends and that's it. Completely ignoring the fact that his bio had a line - ""looking to suck dicks if things go there"". I forgave him.. A month later we had a huge fight where he made me feel like I had made him feel like shit and stuff. It was when I was away on an office trip and couldn't call him in the morning or noon, but only in evening. And then we fought. He told me he is depressed and has cried and not slept. And that he won't eat. Regardless we sorted it out. When we sorted it out and I was just going through his photos, I found his pic with another guy in a coffee shop - an hour after we had our fight that day. I confronted him ki who is this guy and he told me that he met him as a friend and that he's sorry for hiding. Point to note is that just before that I was showing him my pics from the office trip and he got angry at me cuz all he remembered from it was our fight where he felt like shit. Well that also passed by and I forgave him.
A month later i checked his phone because I saw him texting some guys. And I saw that in last 6 months he had sexted with a lot of guys, also planned meetups. I saw him taking cabs to meet other guys in his history. I saw that when we were living together and I went out to friends or family he had met up with other guys at my place. And interestingly we had fought all those times when I went out to my friends.

 I checked his phone cried for a couple of hours and then woke him up asking him why'd he do that to me. He woke up asking me what. And I told him that I checked his phone and found a lot of things. He told me he never cheated on me and that he is sorry. I broke up with him but by the end of the day I forgave him again :). After that a year has passed now and I think about him cheating on me daily. Last November I saw texts in his phone where he asked a guy to meet up to have fun. Although the guy was busy so they didn't meet according to the chat but I don't know if he met with any other guys - because now he deleted his messages - even in front of me.

Everytime we fight I end up thinking this over and over getting anxious wanting to break up but then I see his face and i melt - enough to just stick with him. I don't know what to do. Tomorrow is his bday and I just can't stop thinking about wanting to break up with him. And I'm sure that if i try it over a call or meet I wouldn't be able to do it. 

Should I break up with him? Or should I stick.. and is it okay to do it over text cuz I don't have courage to see him hurt.

Missed a few bad things about me - according to him I don't accept my mistakes and say sorry. I have been trying to do it. Also he thinks I get angry and say hurtful things to him which he can't recover from. He still gets angry and sad at times saying that he just remembered me saying hurtful things (for which I always end up apologizing at the end of the fight - where I didn't even realise how I was more hurtful than him cuz he says pretty mean things at times)

What I did not expect was to fall in love with the coffee. I realized that I had never really had a proper espresso, cappuccino, or latte in my life. I’ve noticed that many American coffee shops don’t even have a shot of just espresso on their menu. 

I was in San Francisco last weekend and wandered into a small coffee shop that looked like they knew what they were doing. I thought it was a good opportunity for me to try a “good” espresso. I don’t typically drink straight espresso, and I wanted to see how to make a macchiato, so that’s what I ordered. My understanding is that a macchiato is espresso with a small amount (a few teaspoons) of milk. They prepared the espresso and then proceeded to add way more milk than I thought and even made some latte art on top. There was less milk than a cappuccino or latte, but it seems like way too much to just “stain” the espresso. I also found the espresso to be sour and not very tasty.

I bought a small inexpensive espresso machine and I’ve been playing it. I like cappuccinos or sometimes a latte, and adding the milk is very forgiving as far as the quality of the espresso. I’ve been taking a small sip of my espresso before adding the milk to see how it tastes. feel like I can turn out a decent cappuccino. Not as good as Italy, but I’m happy with them. I honestly thought the espresso that I’m turning out from my inexpensive little machine and very limited skills was better than this thing I paid for in San Francisco. 

Can you get good, authentic espresso drinks in the US at a coffee shop? ",0,1741101655.0,espresso,17,0.19,False

I was taught to put my own needs and desires last to take care of everyone else. So, it’s no surprise that as an adult, I fell into the same patterns with my family, even after I started setting boundaries.

What I desperately wanted was freedom—the emotional release from feeling responsible for fixing them.

Like many women, I (F53) internalized the messages that told me I had to be the caretaker, that prioritizing myself was selfish. Even with strong boundaries in place, I still struggled with guilt. But I knew that truly healing meant learning to let that go. The first step? Learning to trust myself—to believe, deep down, that my needs and desires mattered. Here’s how I started:

Find a quiet space and take a few deep breaths. Center yourself.

Picture something or someone that brings you deep joy. Maybe it’s cuddling your cat, dancing at a wedding, or laughing over coffee with a close friend. Imagine yourself in that moment. Now, pay attention to your body. Where do you feel this good feeling? Your belly, chest, forehead? What does it feel like—warmth, lightness, waves? There’s no right or wrong answer, just notice.

Now, do the opposite. Imagine something or someone you dread—a toxic coworker, a dentist’s drill, a tense conversation with family. Again, observe your body. Where do you feel it? Your stomach, back, hips? Does it feel like ice, tension, heaviness? Just take note.

This is your internal compass. Family dynamics are messy, clouded by history, expectations, and the pressure to be a “good daughter.” But your body? It never lies. With practice, you can toggle between these sensations and use them as a guide.

Next time you’re with family, check in with yourself. If you feel that same heavy, icky sensation, that’s your sign—it’s not right for you. And that’s okay. Trusting yourself is the first step toward letting go of guilt and reclaiming your life.

This is how I finally released the weight of feeling like I had to fix my family—by learning to trust myself and honoring my needs.

If this resonates with you, I’d love to hear your experience. What does joy feel like in your body? How about discomfort?

Is it reasonable for me to expect the mini fridge provided to not be shared use?

I am so grateful my workplace provided me a private space to pump. It’s a visitors office, with frosted glass, no locking door, but a sign that says “privacy room. do not enter when door is closed”. Inside is a mini fridge, which is super awesome. I brought a cooler bag, but I’m not sure if milk would stay cold enough in there for an 8 hour work day. 
I don’t have my own office here; I work in a cubicle typically, so I come to this office only when pumping. It’s surrounded by other offices in a hallway, then about 30 feet away is a kitchenette with coffee maker and full sized fridge. 

Before my maternity leave, the safety officer showed me where this room would be and showed me that he was cleaning out a mini fridge for my use. He’s a super nice guy, and is out on disability now that I’m returning. Today, I go to put my expressed milk in the mini fridge of the privacy room, and there are other items inside belonging to other people in this hallway. 

Do I totally need a privilege check? Not all mothers are even provided a fridge, so I just count my blessing right? 

My main concern is sanitation and temperature regulation. What if people touch my bottles? what if the door is left open, or opened regularly enough to dip the temperature? Either way it must be better than a cooler bag right? 
Ugh I guess I feel like why can’t I just have the fridge be mine? I have a good reason for a separate fridge and these other people are just being too lazy to walk to the kitchenette. ",2,1741101464.0,ExclusivelyPumping,2,1.0,False

I'm testing my Silent Knowledge simulation again, in order to get help from ""infinity"".

Actually you read about that already, if you read all of the books. Seers are never so powerful as when they try to intend things on behalf of others.

I figure, it's that ""intent gift"" thing. If you put yourself in the middle between the spirit and others being gifted, you get some of the ""fallout"".

I'm satisfied mostly with this scene, but I might adjust it a little more.

And hopefully I'll get to visually watch what to adjust, tonight when I practice darkroom.

This leads up to the man you see going in and out of the visions without any volition on his part, in his physical body, until he finds one he likes which doesn't suck him in and which remains long enough for him to understand what he's seeing. At which point he deliberately zips right off into it, and disappears.

I have a theory about that.  When you have no volition and go in and out of the ""videos in the air"" you see in Silent Knowledge, you really didn't.  You merely noticed that your double is already in there.  You shifted your attention to that of your double, because your energy body has been restored through Tensegrity.

But when you have a chance to watch one of those scenes a little in your tonal body, then you can make the decision to go into that scene in your totality.  Surely you catch up with the double once you get inside, but the act of going into it was ""on purpose"", and the decision made in your Tonal body.  So you bring your full rationality into it, instead of just being a ""ride along"" in the double.

I have no idea how you get back. You just find yourself back where you came from, perhaps the next day. With no bruises on your body from falling over.

And do I have to remind anyone?

This is NOT lame Eastern meditation you do with your eyes closed, and then exaggerate to your meditation buddies in order to get attention or steal money.

You do this all alone, eyes wide open, and completely sober. In your physical body. And NIGHTLY.

Not once so that you can write your, ""I'm an Amazing Yogi"" biography.

We get to do this sort of thing so often that soon it's not even startling or unusual. It becomes more like talking a daily walk at night, exploring the little neighborhoods around your home.

No one does that but us! Although as we make more and more learning materials like this, outside systems will begin to pretend they can.

It's like those ""cake pops"".

Who ever heard of those???

But once Starbucks had them, they began to show up everywhere.

Does that make us the Starbucks of magic?

Better not. Some in our community don't approve of coffee.

Myself, I love that stuff!

Otherwise I'm too old to get up at 2AM to practice darkroom, after being at work for 12 hours during the day.

# Understanding IPTV on Firestick: The Basics

The way we watch TV has totally changed. Remember when we had to wait for our favorite shows at specific times? Those days are gone! IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) has changed everything, letting us watch what we want, when we want. And Firestick users are loving it.

But what exactly is IPTV? Simply put, it's TV content delivered through internet protocols instead of traditional cable or satellite. This means you can access thousands of channels from around the world using just your internet connection and a compatible device like the Amazon Firestick.



I've tested dozens of IPTV services over the years, and the main things to look for include:

* Streaming quality and reliability
* Channel selection and content variety
* Compatibility with Firestick
* User interface and ease of use
* Customer support
* Price and value

The Amazon Firestick has become one of the most popular streaming devices because of its portability, affordability, and ease of use. When paired with a quality IPTV service, it transforms your regular TV into an entertainment powerhouse.

# Why Necro IPTV Stands Out for Firestick Users

After testing numerous IPTV services on my Firestick, [Necro IPTV](https://necro-iptv.com/) consistently performs better than the competition. What makes it stand out? Let me share my personal experience.

First, the streaming quality is exceptional. Many IPTV services struggle with buffering issues, especially during peak hours or when streaming HD content. Necro IPTV maintains stable streams even during high-traffic periods. I've watched live sports events, which typically cause problems on other services, with almost no interruptions.



The installation process couldn't be simpler. As someone who has helped many friends set up their Firesticks, I can tell you that Necro IPTV's setup is straightforward:

1. Subscribe to Necro IPTV
2. Download the recommended app (they provide detailed instructions)
3. Enter your provided credentials
4. Start streaming immediately

Another major advantage is the [multi-device support](https://necro-iptv.com/multi-device). With a single subscription, you can connect up to 5 devices simultaneously. This means your Firestick in the living room, bedroom TV, tablet, and phone can all use the service at the same time without additional costs.

# Comprehensive Channel Selection and Content Library

The [channel list](https://necro-iptv.com/channel-list) offered by Necro IPTV is truly impressive. With over 10,000 live TV channels from around the world, you'll never run out of content to watch.

Their channel lineup includes:

|Category|Number of Channels|Features|
|:-|:-|:-|
|US Channels|1,500+|Local networks, premium cable|
|UK Channels|900+|BBC, Sky, sports networks|
|Sports|1,200+|All major leagues and events|
|Movies|2,000+|Dedicated movie channels|
|Kids|300+|Age-appropriate content|
|International|4,000+|Channels from 60+ countries|
|News|250+|Global news networks|

Beyond live TV, Necro IPTV provides an extensive Video on Demand (VOD) library with thousands of movies and TV shows. The content is regularly updated with new releases, ensuring you always have fresh entertainment options.



What I particularly like is how well-organized the content is. Everything is categorized logically, making it easy to find exactly what you're looking for without endless scrolling. The EPG (Electronic Program Guide) is accurate and updated frequently, something that many competing services fail to maintain.

# Technical Performance on Firestick Devices

Technical performance is where many IPTV services fall short, but Necro IPTV excels. I've tested it on multiple Firestick generations, including:

* Firestick Lite
* Firestick (standard)
* Firestick 4K
* Firestick 4K Max

The service runs smoothly across all devices, though predictably, the experience is better on the more powerful models. On the 4K Max, channel switching is nearly instant, and HD streams start in seconds.

Stream stability is excellent, with minimal buffering even during high-definition content. This is crucial for sports fans who don't want to miss important moments due to technical issues. I've watched entire football games without a single interruption.

Key technical aspects that improve the Firestick experience include:

* Optimized app performance
* Multiple server locations to reduce latency
* Adaptive streaming based on your connection speed
* Regular server maintenance and upgrades

The interface works perfectly with the Firestick remote, making navigation intuitive. Some IPTV services have clunky interfaces that are clearly not designed with Firestick users in mind, but Necro IPTV feels native to the platform.



# Pricing Plans and Value Comparison

[Pricing](https://necro-iptv.com/pricing) is always a major consideration, and Necro IPTV offers competitive plans that provide excellent value compared to both traditional cable and other IPTV services.

Their pricing structure is straightforward:

|Plan|Price|Details|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Monthly|$15|Full access, cancel anytime|
|Quarterly|$40|$13.33/month equivalent|
|Annual|$120|$10/month equivalent (best value)|

All plans include the full channel lineup, VOD content, multi-device support, and 24/7 customer service. There are no hidden fees or extra charges for premium content.

When you compare this to a typical cable subscription ($80-120/month) or even competing IPTV services (typically $20-25/month), the value becomes clear. For the price of a couple of coffees per month, you get access to content that would cost hundreds with traditional providers.

What makes this an even better deal is the [refund policy](https://necro-iptv.com/refund-policy). If you're not satisfied with the service, you can request a refund within 48 hours of purchase. This shows confidence in their product and gives new customers peace of mind.

# Installation and Setup Guide for Firestick

Setting up Necro IPTV on your Firestick is straightforward, even if you're not particularly tech-savvy. Here's a step-by-step guide based on my own experience:

1. **Subscribe to Necro IPTV**
   * Visit the [official website](https://necro-iptv.com/)
   * Choose your subscription plan
   * Complete the payment process
   * Check your email for login credentials
2. **Prepare Your Firestick**
   * Go to Settings > Device > Developer Options
   * Enable ""Apps from Unknown Sources""
   * Enable ""ADB Debugging""
3. **Install a Compatible IPTV App**
   * Download a recommended app like TiviMate or IPTV Smarters
   * You can use the Downloader app to install these
4. **Configure the App**
   * Open the installed app
   * Select ""Add Playlist"" or similar option
   * Enter the M3U URL provided in your subscription email
   * Enter your username and password
5. **Start Streaming**
   * Browse channels or use the search function
   * Customize your favorites for quick access

https://preview.redd.it/wi59ta9gvome1.jpg?width=8256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d501e5462c48678b21e0e8451aaaaf616cda14f

The entire process takes about 5 minutes. Once set up, the app will remember your credentials, so you won't need to sign in each time you use it.

One tip from my experience: After setting up, take a few minutes to organize your favorite channels. This will save you time later when you just want to quickly find something to watch.

# Customer Support and Service Reliability

Customer support can make or break an IPTV service, and Necro IPTV shines in this area. They offer multiple support channels:

* 24/7 live chat on their website
* Email support with response times typically under 2 hours
* Detailed FAQ section and knowledge base
* Video tutorials for common issues

I've contacted their support team several times with various questions, and each time I received prompt, helpful responses. When I had an issue with channel access, they resolved it within minutes.

Service reliability is equally important. In the six months I've been using Necro IPTV, I've experienced only two brief outages, both of which were resolved within an hour. Their server infrastructure is clearly robust and well-maintained.

Planned maintenance is always announced in advance through email notifications, allowing users to plan accordingly. These maintenance windows typically occur during off-peak hours to minimize disruption.



What I particularly appreciate is their transparency. When there are issues, they acknowledge them and provide regular updates until resolution, rather than leaving customers in the dark.

# User Experiences and Community Feedback

Don't just take my word for it. The IPTV community has widely positive things to say about Necro IPTV. After reviewing numerous forums and social media groups, I've noticed these common themes in user feedback:

* Praise for stream stability and quality
* Appreciation for the vast channel selection
* Positive comments about responsive customer service
* Satisfaction with the value for money

One user wrote, ""After trying 5 different IPTV services, Necro has been the most reliable by far. No more explaining to my wife why the TV keeps buffering during her favorite shows!""

Another mentioned, ""The channel organization makes finding content so much easier than my previous provider. Everything is where you'd expect it to be.""

Of course, no service is perfect. Some users mentioned occasional issues with specific channels or EPG accuracy. However, these complaints were notably fewer compared to discussions about other IPTV services, and most users reported that issues were quickly resolved when reported.



The community aspect is important. Active user forums and Facebook groups allow subscribers to share tips, troubleshoot common issues, and stay updated on new features. Necro IPTV's representatives are often active in these communities, showing their commitment to user satisfaction.

# Legal Considerations and Service Legitimacy

It's important to address the legal aspects of IPTV services. The legality of IPTV varies by country and depends largely on the content being streamed and the rights secured by the provider.

[Necro IPTV](http://necroiptv.us) positions itself as a content aggregator that provides access to publicly available streams. They don't host content directly but rather organize and deliver existing streams in a user-friendly interface.

Users should be aware of the following:

* Laws regarding IPTV vary by jurisdiction
* Using a VPN may be advisable in some locations
* Research your local regulations before subscribing

I'm not a legal expert, so I recommend doing your own research about the legal status of IPTV services in your location. Many users choose to use a VPN service alongside their IPTV subscription for additional privacy and security.

That said, Necro IPTV has been operating reliably for years, suggesting a sustainable business model that works within the existing regulatory framework.

# Conclusion: Is Necro IPTV the Best Choice for Your Firestick?

After extensive testing and comparing Necro IPTV with numerous alternatives, I can confidently say it's among the best IPTV options for Firestick users. Its combination of extensive content, reliable performance, and excellent value makes it stand out in a crowded market.

Is it the absolute best for everyone? That depends on your specific needs. If your priorities include:

* Stable, high-quality streams with minimal buffering
* Vast selection of channels and VOD content
* User-friendly interface optimized for Firestick
* Multi-device support
* Responsive customer service
* Competitive pricing

Then Necro IPTV should be at the top of your list. The service excels in all these areas, making it suitable for both IPTV newcomers and experienced users looking for a better alternative to their current provider.

https://preview.redd.it/qmf7x2ievome1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea07fc9354bcbdbe8273c6625fcc4ee0cdb38a88

For Firestick users specifically, the optimized performance and seamless integration make it an even more compelling choice. The easy setup process and intuitive navigation work perfectly with the Firestick remote, creating a smooth user experience.

I recommend starting with a monthly subscription to test the service yourself. With the 48-hour refund policy, there's little risk in giving it a try. Based on my experience and the overwhelmingly positive community feedback, I suspect you'll be as impressed as I was.

1j3cxka,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1j3cxka/premature_worrying_ruining_potential_relationships/,Premature worrying ruining potential relationships,"I often notice that I start to worry a lot whenever I meet a new girl where there seems to be a mutual romantic interest. I met a girl just this weekend. We connected well and it seemed that it could turn into something more. But then, the worry started setting in. All of a sudden, my mind created all kinds of irrational thought patterns that I normally don't do. I started worrying about missing out and overanalyzing even the smallest of behaviors. Even as I'm writing this, I can feel the physical sensation of unease in the stomach (very common way for my body to experience worry).

So where does this worry come from? I did some reflection and found that my worry probably stems from past potential relationships that I missed out on due to a lack of commitment on my part. So whenever I meet someone that seems like it could turn into something, I start to worry and my mind goes:

>""how can i be flirty without being creepy?"" ""should I get a haircut or does it seem too ambiguous?"" ""what if she loses interest?"" ""should I invite her out for a coffee or is it cringe?"" ""I need to make a move or she's gonna go for someone else"" ""is sending a voice note creepy?""

As you can probably see, there's a lot of overthinking going on. And the frustrating part is that whenever I don't worry, I usually manage to commit pretty well. Like this weekend, I connected well with the girl, wanted to get to know her more so I asked for her snapchat. Simple. No worries. Or today, I got a haircut and just now sent her a message asking if she was up to take a coffee sometime. I wish I could have this ""fuck it"" approach more. But it's these short experiences of worry that sometimes makes me think irrationally and I fear it's gonna make me ruin a potential relationship. I wish to be free from it.

The worst part is that worry is a losing game. If everything goes my way (which is an unrealistic expectation), I have not gotten rid of the worry. If it doesn't go my way, it only amplifies the worry. Not sure how to deal with it.

1j3crrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1j3crrk/5_practices_to_improve_your_mental_health_today/,5 Practices to Improve Your Mental Health Today,"Mental health is just as important as physical health, yet it often gets overlooked in our busy lives. Taking care of your mental well-being is essential for living a balanced, happy, and fulfilling life. The good news is that improving your mental health doesn’t require drastic changes; small, consistent practices can make a huge difference. Here are five practices you can incorporate into your daily routine to start boosting your mental health today.

# 1. Practice Mindfulness and Meditation

Mindfulness and meditation are powerful tools for improving mental health. These practices involve focusing your attention on the present moment, helping you stay grounded and calm. They can reduce feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression by allowing you to release negative thoughts and cultivate a sense of inner peace.

To get started, find a quiet space and focus on your breath for a few minutes each day. You can also explore guided meditation apps or mindfulness exercises like body scans. Over time, regular practice can help you become more self-aware, reduce mental clutter, and promote emotional balance.

# 2. Exercise Regularly

Physical activity has a profound impact on mental health. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins—natural chemicals that improve your mood and reduce stress. Regular exercise has been shown to alleviate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even insomnia. It doesn't matter whether it's a brisk walk, yoga, or a dance session; what matters is moving your body.

Try to incorporate at least 20-30 minutes of physical activity into your daily routine. Choose activities you enjoy so that it feels less like a chore and more like a fun, uplifting part of your day. Not only will exercise improve your physical health, but it will also leave you feeling more energized and emotionally balanced.

# 3. Cultivate Gratitude

Gratitude is a simple yet powerful practice that can significantly improve your mental well-being. By focusing on what you’re thankful for, you shift your attention from negative thoughts to positive ones. This practice has been linked to increased happiness, lower stress levels, and improved overall well-being.

Start by keeping a gratitude journal where you write down three things you’re grateful for each day. These can be small moments, like a warm cup of coffee in the morning or a kind word from a friend. Regularly practicing gratitude helps train your brain to focus on the positives in life and fosters a mindset of abundance and contentment.

# 4. Connect with Others

Social connections are crucial for mental health. Loneliness and isolation can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety, while strong relationships provide support, laughter, and a sense of belonging. Making time for meaningful social interactions can improve your mood and help you cope with life's challenges.

Reach out to family, friends, or even coworkers for short chats or quality time together. Whether it's having a conversation over the phone, meeting for a coffee, or participating in group activities, nurturing relationships can provide comfort and boost your mental health.

# 5. Set Boundaries and Practice Self-Care

Taking care of your mental health means recognizing when you need a break and giving yourself permission to rest. Setting boundaries in your personal and professional life is essential for maintaining a healthy balance. Overcommitting and neglecting self-care can lead to burnout, stress, and emotional exhaustion.

Make sure to set aside time for yourself each day. Whether it’s reading a book, taking a relaxing bath, or enjoying a hobby, prioritize activities that recharge your mind and body. Saying “no” when you’re feeling overwhelmed is not only okay, it’s necessary for your mental well-being.

# Conclusion

Improving your mental health doesn’t require major changes—it’s about making small, positive adjustments to your daily routine. Practicing mindfulness, exercising regularly, cultivating gratitude, nurturing social connections, and setting healthy boundaries are all simple yet effective ways to enhance your well-being. By incorporating these practices into your life, you can create a foundation for greater mental clarity, emotional balance, and overall happiness. Start today, and take small steps towards a healthier, more peaceful mind.",1,1741100668.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

What if books had memories? Like, what if they actually remembered everything they went through?

Or worse, gathering dust on a shelf while shinier, newer books get all the attention. Would Harry Potter proudly write about the millions of kids whispering spells over its pages? Would a tattered copy of Pride and Prejudice fondly recall generations of hopeless romantics swooning over Mr. Darcy? And what about those poor, forgotten textbooks—would they bitterly rant about being skimmed at 2 AM before an exam? Some books would have epic, adventure-filled lives—passed between friends, filled with scribbled notes and coffee stains. Others? A tragic existence, untouched and longing to be read again. I don't know why, but now I reallyyyyy want to know—if books could write memoirs, which one do you think would have the best story to tell? Are there any books like this already???

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

This has been snowballing for months, and I honestly don’t know if I’m the one who actually caused this — or if this was bound to happen eventually because of years of tension.

The background:
My cousin (let’s call him Ryan) and I were incredibly close growing up — more like siblings than cousins. We spent our whole childhood together, went to the same school for years, and were each other’s built-in best friend. But once Ryan got serious with his now-spouse (Sarah), things started to change. Sarah and I never really clicked, and there’s been a long history of tension between us that only got worse over time.

Some examples:
	
•	Ryan and Sarah started secretly dating when we were kids, and I was the only one who knew. That alone put me in a weird spot, and even though I kept the secret, things were awkward between Sarah and me from the start.
	
•	For my birthday one year, I planned a group outing to a local water park and invited all my cousins, including Ryan. I paid for everyone’s tickets because I really wanted them all there and wanted it to feel special. Sarah wanted to come, but I couldn’t afford to cover her too. I told her upfront, and she didn’t end up coming — but she later told Ryan she felt excluded, and it became an issue.
	
•	That same year, my dad gifted Ryan and me concert tickets to a band we both liked growing up. It wasn’t “our band” or anything sentimental like that, just something we both happened to enjoy. Sarah got upset and said it was a “couples thing” and that I had crossed a boundary. I remember thinking it was bizarre — Ryan is my blood relative, not my boyfriend. And I didn’t buy the tickets?
	
•	A couple years later, Sarah saw a Facebook post from a family member she had never even met. It was a Taco Tuesday-themed post where someone wore a sombrero. Sarah messaged that family member directly, accusing them of racism and cultural appropriation. She wasn’t at the gathering — she saw the post online and took it upon herself to confront a total stranger from my family. The family member was humiliated and confused, and it caused a lot of unnecessary tension.
	
•	During COVID, Sarah told me I wasn’t social distancing properly after I went running with some friends (masked and distanced). She said I was “the problem” and blocked me — and Ryan followed her lead.

After about a year, Ryan and I patched things up over coffee, and Sarah and I had a long FaceTime where she told me I was a “constant topic” in her therapy. She said she felt like I had always been in competition with her for Ryan’s attention — which floored me, because Ryan is my cousin. I told her that was weird and untrue, but I genuinely wanted to move forward. We agreed to leave the past behind us. I had invited them to all my gatherings, birthday parties, holiday parties, etc.

Then came Ryan’s birthday party — and the comment that triggered all of this.
At the party, my younger cousin asked why my former best friend (let’s call her Emily) and her husband rushed into marriage and kids. I casually said, “Because he’s Hispanic.”

I get how that sounds, but it wasn’t a stereotype I made up. Emily’s husband and I had actually had a deep conversation about this — he told me that his culture and religious background placed a big emphasis on family, marriage, and having kids young, and that it shaped a lot of their decisions. I actually respected that, and I thought it was beautiful. But at a birthday party, I didn’t want to launch into all of that, so I gave a quick, surface-level answer and moved on. I was still really emotional at the time over other things, and I didn’t want to get into it-it wasn’t the time or place. No one said anything at the time.

Months later, Ryan texted me out of nowhere saying he “won’t tolerate racism.”
I had no idea what he was talking about. I asked for clarification, but he ignored me and Sarah blocked me after some back and forth, I tried to apologize but was met with anger. I was completely blindsided. They never-still haven’t-told me directly what the problem was, or what they were upset about. 

I reached out repeatedly.
I apologized if the comment had come across wrong, explained the full context, and made it clear I was open to talking about it directly and working through any hurt feelings. They refused. Instead, they told our extended family that “talking to me enables racism.” It didn’t lead to anyone fully cutting me off, but the vibe definitely shifted — people were a lot more hesitant to engage with me, and holidays felt more awkward than usual.

They eventually responded — but only if we met with a mediator.
This felt extreme for what I thought was a simple misunderstanding, but I agreed. I asked if I could bring someone to support me — either my boyfriend or my dad — since they’d both been helping me process all of this. They refused, saying they had no interest in talking to my boyfriend. That’s when I got uncomfortable — it felt like they were trying to corner me in a two-against-one situation.

Then Sarah sent me a final message:
She claimed I’d had “plenty of opportunities to apologize” and that all my apologies were either “conditional” or “blanket.” She also claimed I said, “You know how Latinos are, they just pop out babies,” which I never said — not at the party or at any point in my life. She called me narcissistic for wanting to explain myself, and said they were permanently cutting me off. They blocked me.

And now, the fallout:
For my dad’s birthday, Ryan bought him concert tickets. But my dad refused to go — he was furious that Ryan would cut me off like this, and said Sarah’s behavior reminded him of my abusive ex. Instead, my grandma came in from out of town,(my dad’s mom) and hosted a birthday dinner for him the same night. Ryan took that as a personal attack and got even angrier.

Now Ryan and Sarah are furious with my dad, my dad is furious with Ryan, my grandma is stuck in the middle, and somehow I’m being blamed for everything. I never asked anyone to take sides — all I ever wanted was a chance to clear up a misunderstanding and move on. Instead, I’m being painted as some racist villain over a poorly phrased comment that was never meant to be hurtful in the first place.

1j3cn05,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1j3cn05/i_am_feeling_confused_about_a_friendship_i_need/,I am feeling confused about a friendship. I need an opinion.,"Long post: 

Hi, I F(29) am best friends with another F(31). 
We got so close during COVID. My older sister had to terminal cancer during this time so becoming friends with this person who is really an aid to my heart. Especially with the state of the world. 
Over the last couple of years we’ve had so many amazing memories, especially when it’s just us two, our bond is one of a kind, we always joke that we were probably past lovers. There’s absolutely no feelings involved I’m married and she is so beyond straight. Just want to emphasize on that. But we both found each other during a very tough time in our lives and I think that that’s why our bond has always been very strong from the gecko. 

I have noticed throughout our friendship I’ve been left feeling very confused. I have ADHD not that that has anything to do with it or maybe it does but it’s really important. I just have stability and consistency in my life, especially with those around me.  I understand we all have off days and sometimes we may be off around other people, but I feel what it happens more so than not I start to question it I not doing enough. Do I not deserve the same treatment as other others and what not and I do find that to be a me problem, not projecting that onto anyone. 

But I guess what is hurtful is that when we’re alone it’s such a great time to the point where I look forward to our hangouts and talking. But the moment we are around other people, I noticed a dynamic completely shift, especially if I start getting complimented or I’m not giving her my full attention. They’re also other instances for example example of something good is happening in my life and I let her know she’ll congratulate me and then all of a sudden she’ll stop responding to my messages for a couple days. She’ll respond here and there but then leave me on read from majority of our messages and this has been a pattern throughout our friendship I try not to judge my friends because I feel like I am nowhere to judge, but I also can’t help myself by noticing these little things. 

Also I feel like we’re both grown and maybe that’s where my judgment falls that there’s no need to act like we’re in high school and trying to compete. I don’t try to compete with her because she is beautiful in her own way. She has all these amazing values. I admire so much. I even look up to her in many things. 
I noticed  when it comes to me, that sometimes she has a hard time, even complimenting me she’ll compliment everyone else in the room and not me and that’s OK. She doesn’t owe me that but I just find that strange. 

This last interaction I noticed that she would get really dry with me if I wasn’t around her as much where if I wasn’t talking to her as much. And then she would switch up on me and be all loving and warm. 

It’s honestly very confusing and I’ve tried to talk to her about this but how can I talk to someone when something may be involving insecurity I could be totally wrong but I just get a sense that maybe there’s something that I do that makes her feel insecure about herself or pisses her off. 

We’ve all been there and sometimes we don’t even realize it. I can think of a time when I was younger and I didn’t feel my most self so I was always trying to be around people. I hope to be one day if that makes sense until later in life, I’ve found my own authenticity in my own voice and my own way of expressing myself. 

There’s a lot of of other instances, but these are the top ones that I noticed repeatedly happen something good happens. She starts acting distance then she’s back like nothing and sometimes if she notices, I’m pulling away, she Venmo me money for coffee or something like that since this has already happened multiple times the times I have to try talking to her. 
She’s deflected or kind of not really addressed much more she will be super kind after and then go back to the same thing. 

Our other really good friend told me that I’m always giving so much that I just give without really thinking things through sometimes, which is a beautiful quality to have, but it’s not OK to give to people that don’t reciprocate that. This same friend also mentioned to me, “I always notice she takes so much from you almost like she expects it now but it’s so hard for her to even give you an ounce of what you give her.” 

And not that it’s about who gives what more to each other but friendships are reciprocations not one-sided. So I don’t know if I should just start distancing myself or if I should just try to talk to her one more time but I feel it’s gonna be such an awkward conversation. I’ve always found worth having difficult conversations with people that you love, but I just don’t know about this anymore. ",1,1741100330.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1j3cm4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustedhousesitters/comments/1j3cm4h/trying_to_figure_out_if_we_would_be_considered_a/,Trying to figure out if we would be considered a desirable sit (in Nashville TN) . . .,"Hello. I have only recently become aware of Trusted Housesitters after friends successfully used this service when they traveled out of the country.  They have been extremely happy with the arrangement and have used the same sitters on multiple occasions.  Here is our scenario; please help me discern if we would be a desirable sit for someone.  We are a lesbian couple living in Inglewood/East Nashville, a very popular historic neighborhood adjacent to downtown Nashville and an easy Uber ride to most anywhere in town.  We are within walking distance of a popular corner with a neighborhood pub, several great restaurants and a coffee shop.  The broader East Nashville area is full of great bars, coffee shops, restaurants, music venues, shops, health food stores, a nice city park, greenway, etc.  Lots of artists and musicians live in East.  We have a small (1400 sq foot) Tudor built in the 1950's.  We are very  clean and organized, which we could demonstrate with pictures and video/FT walk thru's.  We have a large fenced back yard and a very nice deck to hang out on. The actual living arrangements are quite comfortable and cozy with 2 BR's and 2 bathrooms, though we would ask sitters to use the guest bed and bath for showering.  We have a 7 year old female greyhound.  While she is quite sweet and easy in most ways, here are the ""downsides"":  she is skittish when it comes to strangers petting or touching her, and will snap if someone puts their hands on or near her to pet her, even though she seems to want pets and love.  Our current dog sitter has, over time, learned her ways, and gives her wide berth bc of the ""space guarding"".  She hasn't ever bit anyone directly, but I always advise people who visit us to not pet her.  She has never snapped at anyhone who has not put their hands in her space.  She gets on the furniture and sleeps in our bed, so a housesitter would need to sit on the opposite end of the sofa and sleep in the guest room (queen size memory foam mattress).  The other big concern is that she will go through phases where she eats her poop \~ I know, it's SO GROSS.  For this reason, we watch her when she goes out and scoop the poop and toss it over out back fence.  Since we have such a big yard, she would not need to be walked.  We did have a sitter leave our gate open once and our previous greyhound got out, so for this reason, we ask everyone to park outside of the gate.  This has never been a problem with other dog sitters.  She's a good eater, doesn't have any medical issues, doesn't pee or poop in the house, isn't destructive, doesn't have separation anxiety (can be left alone for 7-8 hours assuming she has used the bathroom just prior to being left alone).  As we are neat and clean, we would want anyone who stays in our home to respect the space and also keep it tidy.  Because Ursula (our dog) space gaurds, we would not want any other guests to come into the house.  As far as sitting lengths, it could be a long weekend up to 10-14 days, and as we move towards retirement, even up to 3 weeks as go out in our camper.  So, is this a desirable sit?",1,1741100263.0,trustedhousesitters,6,0.67,False

I'm looking for a partner in crime to share adventures with, both IRL and online. Bonus points if you want to rob a bank with me, fly to Bahamas, and 420 together on a tropical hotel beach resort. It'll be a blast!

Some info about me: I'm 33 yrs old and from Sweden, but ethnically Russo-Bengal. I'm 176 cm in height, black hair (tbh more like salt n' peppery), and kind brown eyes. On the heavier side because life really messed me up for a while, but I've lost a little bit and am working on myself both physically and mentally. That said I also have a lot of empathy for your own life struggles. Neurodivergent (very likely autistic, currently waiting for an evaluation), left leaning politically, a mix between a classic and modern man. A humanist and a romantic.

I'm looking to settle down with someone, I've always worn my heart on my sleeve - gone above and beyond for everyone I've ever cared for, so it'd be nice to have some reciprocity. I'm an introvert and a homebody but don't mind going out once in a while, whether it be for something grander or just a cozy coffee together. I get along best with clingy nerdy introverts, and if you're kind and into cute things I'm sure that'll help melt my heart =)

Some of my interests are:

- PC Gaming (WoW Anniversary/Classic/Retail, Overwatch 2, Risk of Rain 2, Civilization 6, Minecraft, Baldur's Gate 3, and plenty more. Let's find the next cool adventure together)

- Music (Daft Punk, Armin van Buuren, The Cure, Suicideboys, Kendrick Lamar, Pixies, Disarmonia Mundi, Modest Mouse, Provoker, and like a billion more)

- TV Shows (Mr. Robot, Battlestar Galactica, Mad Men, The Expanse, Venture Bros., Generation Kill, etc.)

- Movies (too many to list - where would I even start?)

- Anime (Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, No Game No Life, Darker than Black, etc. etc. etc.)

- Shopping (anything nice really)

- Traveling (The Caribbean, Japan, Canary Isles, anywhere nice really, let's go somewhere together)

- Coding (Currently switching from a niche field to back-end, but I've always wanted to make a game with someone)


There's more to me than that, but perhaps we can save the rest for conversation. DMs open, so tell me a little bit about yourself and let's go from there. I prefer moving to a different app (guess which one is ideal for streaming movies and gaming?) if we hit it off. Cheers and have a nice day/evening!",1,1741099922.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1j3cgr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1j3cgr5/aio_for_believing_my_best_friend_is_emotionally/,AIO for believing my best friend is emotionally manipulating me?,"So my best friend and roommate (M22) and I (F22) are VERY different. Idk how else to describe it but I’m a very anxiously attached person who has put a lot of effort into making things better for myself and he’s VERY VERY avoidant.

Anyways, I was annoyed with him and the rest of our friend group (3 others, but my annoyance was mostly regarding him since he’s been friends with me since freshman year). I was stressed because I was trying to figure a bunch of life and school stuff out. Where things really started to piss me off was with my best friend. For ease of identification let’s call him Tyler. I know our relationship is really weird for one- he’s gay and I’m mostly if not completely into women, but we share a really close bond. Kind of like a besties but more than thing idk. But lately we’ve been going at it because he used to be super nice to me and now he’s kind of just distant and we both SAID we want to fix it. But I feel like most of the time I’m putting in like 100% and he’s putting in like… 10? He said it’ll get better once we graduate and he’s not so stressed but idk if I believe it.

For the past few weeks I’ve been asking (begging? Kinda cause I need to be around other ppl to get my stuff done) to work with him on homework. I’ll always text him that I’m in the cafe or wherever and he almost always says because his work is all on this one computer in the computer lab he can’t. Which is totally fine! Yesterday I was like ‘hey I’m gonna join you if you don’t mind! Gotta get a lot of work done.’ And he said he actually was studying with like 6 others in another building. I’ll admit I probably sounded mean but it was more of a joke when I said “Interesting that you can never leave here because you have so much work on the computer but now all of a sudden it’s not an issue” and he left me on read.

Later he joined me and that’s where things reaaaaally started to take a turn for the worse. Again, I’ll admit I was probably not helping because I missed my medication for the day and the withdrawal was hitting me super hard, because I brought it up again and was like “bro if you just don’t want to study with me you can say that” to which he replied “we are studying together now right? I just wanted a change of pace.” Which I get and that’s fine.

And then things took like a mega ultra nose dive lol. I’ll admit I probably shouldn’t have downed like 3 sugar free coffees but I was tired af. It all kind of hit me at once and while I was super productive I was also super talkative and not in a good way. Basically I went on a rant to him about how I feel like a laughing stock when he and the rest of our friends are all buddy buddy with this like other extended friend group but every time Tyler invites me with him it’s fake as fuck. Like I can FEEL I don’t belong and when I see them and it’s just me I try to wave and be friendly but they just ignore me. Plus it really annoyed me when one of them was turning in their thesis and I messaged saying ‘hey! Are you turning in today? Would love to see you and give you congrats!’ And he didn’t read it till 12 hours later. But sure enough all the other people were there! 

I know I’m probably reading way too much into it and it sounds so fucking stupid to write it out but I feel like it’s hard to understand unless you’re in my head. I grew up being the odd one out and the outcast all through middle and high school, I always knew I was that weird autistic kid no one liked. It was obvious. And when I went to college everyone treated me all nice and then I glued myself to this friend group and in my fourth fucking year I’m realizing that this whole time I don’t even know if they could be considered my friends. When one girl abused and attempted to ruin my life (literally led to me attempting) they were all still friends with her because ‘I can’t take a side.’ Or when someone in Tyler’s major would literally make fun of me TO HIS FACE and he would laugh it off and proceed to tell me but do nothing when I begged him to stand up for me and he said ‘she’s basically my work friend I can’t do that.’

Idk. I just felt like such an idiot because I realized it’s not normal to want the bare minimum from the people you call your best friends. Like I shouldn’t plead with Tyler to stand up for me or give me basic empathy instead of just saying nothing.

Then I was watching a show I like ‘Tuca and Bertie’ and it was like it was destined because there’s a character in it who is JUST like Tyler. And I would have never realized what he’s doing isn’t good until I saw it portrayed with another person. He disregards my feelings and says I need to stop expecting more from him because he doesnt have time to work on empathizing. He expects me to work around his schedule but puts no effort into doing so. And the worst part is whenever we get upset with each other he will just be silent until I bring it up and force him to respond or if I get over it. I feel like that’s kind of manipulative bc he knows I’m upset and knows I’m not alright and refuses to bring it up and instead isolates/takes a vow of silence until it’s over, and by that point I’m just scared to have things be weird between us so I usually just end up apologizing.

I try to change everything about me to please him and it’s never enough. Like he will say he wants an apartment with me in x city so I ONLY look for post grad opportunities in that city and then he’s like “actually I don’t want to plan anything yet haha.” And then when I finally stand up for myself and say the way he acts around me isn’t best friend shit at all, he says stuff like ‘this is how I’ve always been and I don’t know how to change’ but expects me to change because I’m ’too emotional.’ 

Anyways, when I was watching the show Tuca was begging Kara for ANYTHING. A response or an explanation of what she did wrong just something. And all she does is shrug and say nothing. And it was like… boom. Holy crap. That’s exactly what he does. He just ghosts me in person when I’m upset and then when I come crawling back he just shrugs everything off until I end up apologizing for being too much and pleading with him to not drop me.

I know this is long but am I overreacting? I do have OCD so I might be making things bigger than they are but yeah

1j3cg1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1j3cg1e/my_first_steam_next_fest_experience/,My first steam next fest experience.,"I thought I would write this up while it was still fresh in my mind but for my project the next fest was a bit of a fiasco. Hopefully you won't make my mistakes. 

We appealed to be in the fest after the deadline had passed. We had a functioning demo and thought there was no harm in getting some extra exposure. Steam were kind enough to let us partake. 

We worked on getting steam API integration and getting the build to showcase as much as we could about our USP's. However we left it too late to fully integrate and we had just about got it ready to push, we just need to get the web API key linked. This required the account to have a steam guard. I installed it and didn't think anything of it but by steam normal working practice if an account is upgrading to steam guard you CANNOT push new build for 72 hours. So our demo was 3 weeks old and didn't have any of the cool stuff we had been working on. Not great but it was still playable and steam support managed to lift this in around 12 hours but that was the first day gone. 
We pushed a build out pretty quick after however due to a miscalculation on our part the steam API was for the main game and not the demo. Whoops. This one was costly; players would not be able to get past the loading screen for 2 days as it constantly tried to log into the full version of the game ( as the dev it all worked on my end as I had access ) but this where the install of the steam app helped fix it; it brought to my attention the community posts for the project - not something I check that regularly on the desktop and thankfully some players had mentioned that the game was not loading. We quickly worked it out and fixed it but the median game time plummeted from 20 mins to 4 as lots of players just got a loading screen and left. That was 3 days gone. 

Coffee break. 

Day 4 we worked on getting all of the backlog of updates into a pushable build, this required a lot of merging sometimes as deep as the dev branch. The conflicts kept us busy and we had a games night lined up to stress test the servers. However the merged branches were not done perfectly, maybe we rushed it or just more of a refactor was required but a lot of the fixes and updates just stayed on the side branches. We only had around 5 or so active ones. Either way whatever we did caused the game to fail to work with our back end due to it being outdated and out of sync. This was fixed and by day 5 we got a bunch of playtesters to try some of the modes. 

That was our week, we didn't do much more on the weekend. Kids have a way of stopping you from working.

Overall: we got around 400 wishlists and 300 plays. The debugging on the fly and testing in production we super stressful but kinda rewarding. 

Thanks for reading. Anyone relate ?

So lessons: 
1. You should and can apply for festivals even if you are part the deadline.
2. Integrate steam API early on and make sure you get it ready and tested before, way before the festival. This might not be required for some games tho 
3. When working with a back end make sure you plan for the contingency; when game cannot connect. Allow for data collection of faults and allow for launch in offline mode ( show this to the players and send a report to the backend if you can )
4. Monitor all of your means of bug reporting, not just your main ones as people rarely actually bring up bugs even critical ones. They will just move on.",2,1741099792.0,IndieDev,0,1.0,False

1j3cev2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j3cev2/who_messages_first_dilemma/,Who messages first -dilemma,"Hello!

I know this is probably something people discuss often or ask about. I'm female and I'm dating males. I'm not looking for traditional relationship and that is not why I hesitate to sent the first message. My reasoning is this; I live in quite equal country, men don't offer to pay my coffee that often and that is not something I expect. I also usually say I'm going to buy mine when in rare occassions they offer to treat me. Yet, it is still quite common prejudice to expect a man to take the first step. Because that is the case, I have thought it is best for me to wait till he sends the first message. If he really is attracted to me, why would he go against the common ways and not send the message? But since we know men tend to swipe right more than women and do the actual quality check if they get the match, there is danger they might be just pleased to reply since someone approached them. I might not be the one they actually want, but doesn't hurt to meet and hope to get laid even though I'm clear about looking for only serious relationship.

On the other hand, approaching straight away a person you're interested in puts things rolling atleast a bit sooner. But how common it really is that it is seen somehing positive for a woman to take the first step? I mean, we all can say it is nice and equal if we don't follow dusty old gender roles, but when something actually happens, are our feelings and way to read the situation any more free from those internalised gender roles? My main fears are that if I approach, people are willing to reply only because of wrong intentions. Since the old script, why would a man skip sending the first message if he really was interested of me? Should I just continue as usual, and if I get a match but no messages, that it was another ""I swipe right 50% of women and then do the actual pruning while women more commonly do that at the moment when deciding  wether swiping left or right.",1,1741099706.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

#Introduction for new and renewed interest fans.

Baseball has a long season. I don't just mean that in terms of time between opening day and the World Series (which can be considered long as it is), but also the 162 games played in 183 days, 13 times against the same 4 teams each. It can be daunting, and many people lose interest by ""the dog days"" of June and July. 

This guide is meant to help you if you wish to avoid being one of those who feels overwhelmed and loses interest a couple weeks after Opening Day.

First and foremost if you are a new fan or newly returning, you must remember one thing: you do not need to watch every game. Many football fans, and even some basketball and hockey fans, find this difficult, they're used to setting aside a few nights a week to watch their team, and they can watch all the games. Baseball isn't like that. For the next six months, your team will only have 23 days where they won't be playing a game. And some of the games they play will start as early as 8:05am (Pacific Time), others will end after midnight (Eastern Time). If you miss a game it's okay, odds are there's another one tomorrow. If you miss a week, no big deal, even if you get busy for a few months and aren't able to watch you team, that's not an issue, because you can still *follow* your team.

Baseball is a game to be followed. In the old days it meant picking up the morning paper and checking the box scores. Now it means being able to have a final score texted/notified/messaged/emailed/what-evered to you the minute the game ends, or rolling over in bed when you can't sleep and grabbing your phone to check the West Coast scores. It means being able to check reddit in the morning to see any breaking news from across the league, or catch a story you missed. We live in a time where you can go to MLB.com and get a recap of every game from last night in less than 10 minutes. Honestly, baseball was made to be consumed, and the technology age makes it easier than ever, whether you want to spend hours every day pouring over stats and analysis, or 15 seconds to see how your team and their playoff rivals did today.

The rest of this guide is mostly dedicated to ways that you can help yourself follow your team, and if you have time follow the entirety of MLB.

#Tokyo Series and Opening Day

This year the MLB season begins with a two-game series between the Dodgers and Cubs played in Tokyo, Japan on Tuesday, March 18th and Wednesday, March 19th. Get your coffee ready early, because both games will start at 6:05am EDT. Tuesday's game will be on FOX, and Wednesdays will be on FS1.

Domestic Opening Day will be Thursday, March 27th - kicking off at 3:05pm EDT with the Yankees hosting the Brewers on ESPN. The bulk of games start between then and 4:15pm, before the 7:10pm prime time game with the defending World Series champion Dodgers hosting the Detroit Tigers, also on ESPN. Two west coast games start after 10pm EDT to close out a day that should see 9 straight hours of baseball!

[Full opening day schedule.](https://www.mlb.com/schedule/2025-03-27)

#Rule Changes for MLB 2025


Permanent Changes for 2025:

 - When a fielder is found to be in violation of shift restriction rules and the violating player was the first to touch the ball in play the batting team may accept the result of the play or the batter will be granted a free base (enabling any other runners to advance one base).
 - Runners who overrun bases other than first base may be called out for abandoning the bag even if untagged or beating a throw to the base. This will nullify any runs scored after both runners feet touch dirt past the overrun base.

Potential future changes being tested in the minors:

 - Fully automated strike zone 
 - Umps calling strikes, but teams having 3 challenges to a ball/strike call.

#Finding a Team

I always recommend following the local team since you'll have more access to news about them in the local media and should be able to get their radio broadcast, as well as TV broadcasts of them if you have cable/satellite/streaming, and depending on where you're at the occasional over the air game, but if you don't live by a team or don't want to follow the local team, or are just looking for a second team to follow, [I wrote this in depth guide to picking a team that's the right fit for you.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1j2jsn7/looking_for_a_team_to_follow_this_year_help_is/)

---

#Knowing Where Different Teams Stand

Every year ESPN, Sports Illustrated, FOX, NBC, and every other sports related site puts out their season previews. These are great for getting a basic rundown of what is going on with each team, and a simple google search will bring up a plethora of possible articles to read. If you're a podcast fan and have hours and hours of listening time to burn, I recommend *Effectively Wild*'s team preview series where they interview a beat writer for every MLB team.

For a succinct snapshot of team expectations, [you can look at the fangraphs projected standings](https://www.fangraphs.com/depthcharts.aspx?position=Standings) and [projected playoff odds](https://www.fangraphs.com/standings/playoff-odds) or for a slightly different model you can check the [PECOTA projected standings and playoff odds.](https://www.baseballprospectus.com/standings/) While these aren't as in depth as team previews, looking at both can show which teams are consensus favorites, and which ones are more wild cards in how they're expected to perform.

If what you really want is a fans perspective on what each team's expectations condensed into a few short comments, I'd highly recommend [going through each teams day from our annual ""Why will X team exceed expectations?"" series.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/search?q=flair%3AExpectations%2B%2725&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)

#R/Baseball

Alright, so plugging r/baseball on r/baseball seems a bit redundant, but I think it's a good reminder that this is a great hub for all your MLB news throughout the season while still letting you see the occasional amazing college/minor league/foreign league performance.

During the season there are a number of features to keep you informed of all the goings on around baseball. 

Every day of the season (and a portion of the offseason) there are General Discussion threads called Around the Horn. These are great places to ask questions and discuss anything that you want to know about baseball but don't feel like it deserves it's own post. In the Around the Horn post you'll be able to see a full schedule of what is going on around R/Baseball every week.

During the week the subreddit runs a number of features. **Please note that these are always subject to change.*:

**Daily: Game Threads** - New this year, r/baseball is experimenting with additional game threads throughout the week. Exact amount and timing likely to be tweaked throughout the season as demand dictates, but opening day and early on should be a great place to ask questions and get to know the teams.

**Daily: Nightly Pick'Em** - A ten year running contest to pick the result of one game every day. [Here's last year's introduction thread where you can find details.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1bn5dvu/opening_day_nightly_pick_em_contest_season_10/)

**Monday: Power Rankings** - A team of 30 fans from every team in baseball, led by ~~masochist~~ fearless leader /u/kasutori_jack, releases their composite power rankings of the 30 teams. This leads to well thought out discussions and some in depth analysis, as well as salty fans crying about how their team is underrated (there may be more of the latter than the former, but it's still a great way to keep your finger on the pulse of how every team is doing). 

**Monday: State of the Subreddits** -  /u/double_dose_larry took over posting a State of the Subreddits post that gives the top post from each team's subreddit from the last week. This is a great roundup post for staying up to date on what all the different team fandoms are feeling, and helps you catch any milestones you might have otherwise missed.

**Thursdays: Division Discussions** - Rotating between the Easts, Centrals, and Wests to do some more in depth talk about where the playoff races and teams stand. If you only have time for one r/baseball thread every week and want to keep up with the league, this is the thread to set aside time for. 
 
**Friday: Trash Talk/Compliment/Complaint** - FRIDAYS ARE FUN DAYS, ROTATING BETWEEN TRASH TALK, COMPLIMENT, TRASH TALK, AND COMPLAINT THREADS! TRADITION STATES ALL COMMENTS BE IN ALL CAPS AND ENDING IN EXCLAMATION POINTS! ROTATION IS USED RATHER THAN HAVE A SET DAY FOR EACH ALL SEASON BECAUSE IT'S A LONG SEASON AND ANY ONE OF THE THREE THREADS CAN GET STALE FAST IF YOU DON'T LEAVE TIME FOR MORE AMMUNITION! 

**Sunday: Game of the Week** - Sunday night is the only guaranteed exclusive time slot for a game during the week, so there's always a stickied game thread for the game. The Sunday Night Baseball game thread is usually posted a couple hours before the first pitch.

In addition to all these features, it really is a great place to keep up with breaking news and highlights. It'll be posted here minutes after someone tweets it, and long before it's on MLB.com. Team beat writers get the stories first, and it's easier to check in here a couple times a day than follow every one of them.

**Another note - for the best R/Baseball experience, you should use Old Reddit, which you can access by visiting old.reddit.com/r/baseball.** Old reddit includes a fun sidebar with a full scoreboard of the day's action as well as the current league standings (with little flags that tell you who's in wild card position).

---

#Your Team's Subreddit (And other team subs as well)

The mods at r/baseball have one goal - help you have the best possible reddit baseball experience, and a LOT of that is helping you get connected to other fans of your team (which feels a little like a cop-out because it means less work for us if you're doing more on your team's sub, but your team's mods aren't complaining.)

One of the main draws of team subs (other than in depth discussion with like-fan-minded users, getting breaking news and analysis on your team, team-memes, and other reddit discussions that come up from a group of individuals who can agree on one thing) are game threads. At this time (to the best of my knowledge) every team sub hosts game threads for their team's games, and you can easily access them in the sidebar during the season by clicking on the team's logo in the schedule. 

Even if you're not a game thread person though, getting connected with a good team sub can make disappointing seasons more bearable, and great seasons more exciting, and I know plenty of users that said that their team's sub basically keeps them fans. Team subs are also a great place to get connected to...

#Bluesky, Podcasts, and YouTube Channels

The best way to find the people to follow/sites to visit that interest you the most are to hang around your team's sub and note which sites that are linked to that most often peak your interest. Your list of favorite baseball writers is going to be different than my favorite list, and finding the right social media personalities, podcasts hosts, and YouTubers can make game analysis more interesting for you even if your team is playing like crap and it's the middle of July.

Here are some common suggestions for some baseball bluesky accounts, podcasts, and YouTube Channels that are often recommended by those around the subreddit to get you started, but like I said, find what you like and follow those:

#The Statistical Titans: Baseball Reference and Fangraphs

Literally every day you will find a link or reference to BaseballReference.com or Fangraphs.com here, it's a given, and it's because these are the two most extensive free baseball databases that are easy to navigate. If you want to look up anything about baseball history, check Baseball Reference, if you want to look up how players stack up with non-proprietary advanced metrics or read an insightful blog post about why someone is overrated/underrated or overperforming/underperforming, check Fangraphs. With these two sites you have all the stats and figures you need to make a competent argument for basically anything you want with a little cherry picking.

A large part of the modern baseball world is statistics and you're going to find yourself getting more immersed in discussing the game if you can get a handle on all the terms getting thrown around. **If you are brand new to baseball, take a little while to get to know the game before diving into these sites**, but if you have a handle on the basics and are ready to know what this WAR everyone is talking about is, dive into the glossaries and find the statistics.

When you get the basics, creating your own analysis doesn't seem as daunting, and one of the reasons I love baseball is that I can deconstruct pretty much every play and find some meaning behind it. If you are like that and enjoy numbers, theoretical projections, and breaking things down into simple figures before reconstructing them into something long and beautiful, then learning the basics of sabrmetrics will make you a baseball fan for life. If, on the other hand, you just want to enjoy the game for the beautiful pastime that it is by watching, then we've got a little bit to go through...

#Advanced Stat Tracking... aka the Stat Junkies' Crack

Fangraphs and Baseball Reference contain almost all the stats you'd need for a lifetime, but sometimes you just need something different, and there are some very helpful places on the internet to find some other, more specific or advanced data.

If you are looking for Pitch f/x data, strikezone plots, and/or a breakdown of a pitcher's pitches, check out [BrookesBaseball.net](http://www.brooksbaseball.net/). You can quickly find specific at bats in games, or entire games scatter plots to ~~ruthlessly ridicule and rant about an umpire~~ see why that last pitch was called a strike.

If you want to look up certain statcast data, like which pitchers are throwing the hardest, which fielders are having the fastest sprint speeds, who's hitting the ball the furthest, etc., you should check out [BaseballSavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/). Look at the ""Statistics"" and ""Leaderboards"" sections for more information.

If you are into looking up really specific historical queries, or just want pretty much every baseball stat ever, you can usually find it in the [Lahman Database](https://sabr.org/lahman-database/).

If you are looking for MLB API for your next coding project, you can [find that information here.](https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/) And if you're *really* into statistical analysis and want to test out your R skills, [baseballr is the package of choice.](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/)

#Where to Watch? - Your TV and Streaming Guide

So a big part of baseball is, you know, actually being able to watch the games (though as I talk about at the end, it might not necessarily be the case for you, and that doesn't mean you can't enjoy baseball, skip down and see what I'm talking about in the final section).

**TV Networks**

Fox/FS1- ""Baseball Night in America"": exclusive regional coverage of 2 or 3 Saturday afternoon and/or night games. Non-exclusive games on the cable network, usually Saturday afternoon with some irregularly scheduled weeknight games as well. Also includes the All-Star Game, both division series and the league championship series for one league (AL in 2024) which are split between OTA and cable channels, and the entire World Series on the broadcast network. They also pick up some random midweek games during the season.

ESPN - Exclusive Sunday Night Baseball game. Usually on ESPN proper, but may get bumped to ESPN2 in the early part of the season because of the NBA and NHL playoffs. None are currently planned, but can also go to ABC as well. Also includes opening night, the Little League Weekend game (which is on a Sunday anyway), the Home Run Derby, a few extra late-season games, and the entire Wild Card round of the playoffs (with some overflow to ABC and ESPN2).

TBS - Non-exclusive Tuesday night game all season. Also includes the other league's division series and league championship series (NL for 2025). Overflow is handled on TNT for the division series.

MLB Network - Simulcasts local home team broadcasts daily; many days they'll have multiple games. About once a week (though irregular as to which day) they have the non-exclusive MLB Network Showcase, which is produced in-house. Simulcasts and the Showcase are subject to blackout in home markets, and another simulcast will be substituted instead.

Regional Sports Networks - Most teams have contracts for every game not picked up by a national network (and some simulcasts alongside national broadcasts) to be aired on the local Regional Sports Network. Even teams who have streaming coverage direct from MLB have a cable/satellite channel available to watch games with no other programming on the channel.

**Streaming**

Apple TV+ - Two exclusive Friday Night Baseball games produced in conjunction with MLB Network every week. 

MLB.tv - Subscriber package for watching out-of-town local broadcasts. One game a day is always given as a free sample. Blacked out in the teams' home markets (due to deals between teams and sports networks - it has nothing to do with trying to get you to the ballpark) and for some national broadcasts. See section below for more details.

Teams.tv - The Guardians, Twins, Rockies, Padres, and Diamondbacks all have direct from MLB streaming packages branded as (Team Name).tv. These packages can be bought stand alone in market on the MLB app on various devices, or packaged along with MLB.tv for a discount.

MVPDs (multi-video programming distributers) - The Braves, Cubs, Tigers, Royals, Angels, Marlins, Brewers, Cardinals, Rays, Reds, Red Sox, and Yankees all are on networks that are available to order in separate streaming packages without needing to buy a full cable/satellite/streaming television subscription.

Roku - The Roku Sunday Lead Off has one game on Sundays on the Roku App. This does NOT require you to have a ROKU system as the app is available on various devices.

ESPN+ - One local broadcast a day (not the same game as the freebie on MLB.tv) is simulcast live on ESPN+ in addition to being on MLB.tv. Also on Sundays it simulcasts the Sunday Night Baseball game. More of a throw-in than anything, but if you already have an ESPN+ subscription it's already paid for.

There are also streaming services that grant access to most of the previously mentioned channels:

#MLB.TV - the Ultimate Fan Investment

Alright, so a few things to cover with this, first of all YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LEGALLY STREAM IN MARKET GAMES IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA. MLB.tv uses your IP address to see where you are located, and if it pings back that you are in a team's home market it will not let you watch the game LIVE. [Here is where you can find what games MLB.tv will black you out from.](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlbtv/help-center/blackout-info.jsp?question=which-teams-am-i-blacked-out-from) National broadcasts on ESPN, FOX, and TBS are also subject to blackouts within the United States (MLB Network games are not). Before you ask, yes there are less than legal ways to get around this (spoofing your IP address, subreddit dedicated to mlb streams, etc.), but I won't be talking about those in detail here. 

**International fans**, the only potential games you will be blacked out of are the Apple TV games and postseason games if your country has a network that paid for postseason broadcasting rights.

Even if you are blacked out, you will be able to watch the game 90 minutes after it finishes, so if you work a late shift or stay up late it might be worth it for you anyways even if you only want to follow one team.

Pricing tip - [if you donate $25 to become a MLB Players Alumni Association Fan Member you get 50% off MLB.tv the following year if you continue your membership.](https://www.mlb.com/mlbpaa/membership/fans)

Military members and college students, don't forget to apply your 35% discount! 

**T-Mobile Customers**, you can get MLB.tv FOR FREE using the T Life App.

""But I don't want to watch EVERY out of market game, I just want to watch MY team!"" Cool, for $20 less there's a single team option that will allow you to watch all your team's non-blacked out games! Personally, I'd pay the extra $20 for the opportunity to watch every Skubel and Skenes start, or put the Cubs on in the background while working on a Friday afternoon, but to each their own. [For 21 teams there is also pre/post game coverage that you can watch along with the games.](https://www.mlb.com/live-stream-games/help-center/subscription-access-pre-post-game)

""But I don't want to commit for a full year!"" That's okay, there's a monthly option as well in case you know there are months where you can't watch as much. 

Some of the fun features of MLB.tv include the ability to watch four games at once (added to more device apps this year) and quickly swap your audio from one to another (seriously, I'm never on commercial break when I'm watching baseball, unless there's only one game on I'm able to watch it all, and in September that's huge) and condensed games. What are condensed games? They go through and cut out all the time between pitches and innings, meaning if you want to watch a whole game in less than a half hour (or are searching desperately for a play to make a .gif or streamable out of that for some reason isn't considered a highlight) it's really easy. If you're someone who really wants to get into the game but can't figure out how to grind through watching a full game, Condensed Games are great for keeping up with a team while you learn the little details between pitches that somehow make watching the catcher twiddle his fingers exciting for some fans.

In addition, the previously separate MiLB.tv has been rolled in to the MLB.tv subscription, giving you access to watch minor league games from across the country! No more debating whether to pay $20 more to watch that one prospect for a week then forget you have the subscription because there are always MLB games on at the same time - access to watching any minor league games is now included! All triple A and double A teams will have their games streamed, and select lower level clubs will as well.

Also, MLB has added some great baseball documentaries to your MLB.tv subscription, giving you access to more than just games, as well as winter league coverage of the Dominican League.

**In addition, there is a great resource to enhance your total immersion into baseball if there are multiple games going on.** Please note you must already be logged into MLB.tv to make them work. Baseball Reference has [Stream Finder](https://www.baseball-reference.com/stream-finder.shtml) which lets you customize your preferences so MLB.tv will always switch to the game that is most relevant to you. This is great if you play fantasy and want to keep up with your players, are waiting for someone to hit a milestone, or if you want to make sure your action is broken into to follow a no-hitter in progress.

And in case you don't know which game to watch, every night is **MLB Big Inning** which features live coverage of multiple games bouncing back and forth between high leverage moments and storylines in progress, all directed so you don't need to make the game switches yourself. These also are not subject to blackout restrictions, so if your local team is in a tight game you'll likely get plenty of coverage.

MLB.tv also gives you a free subscription to...

#MLB At Bat - The Most Underrated Way to Stay Connected to Baseball

An [MLB At Bat](https://www.mlb.com/live-stream-games/help-center/mlb-audio-is-now-at-bat) subscription gives you access to every team's radio stream for every game during the season and postseason *completely blackout free* across devices. You also get this with an MLB App subscription. If there's a day game, you can bet I'm listening to it at work, if I'm mowing the lawn on a Saturday I'm listening to a game, when I can't sleep at night, on comes a West Coast game.

Baseball was made to be on the radio, it's a sport that is very easy to follow the action with the right announcer. At work (or school) it's great because you can half listen, and when the announcer gets excited you can instantly tune back in to hear what's going on. This is the most underrated way to stay connected to your team throughout the year. Before I could afford MLB.tv, this was the way to go, and it honestly makes me question every year whether getting the MLB.tv package is worth is when I can get 80% of the entertainment value from listening to the games (and every year I manage to ""forget"" to unsubscribe, for many reasons listed above).

Also, as a nice bonus this year, that MiLB.tv subscription that got rolled into MLB.tv was included in MLB At Bat as well! So if you decide you want to watch some games but don't want to commit to an entire year of MLB.tv, you can catch some upcoming prospects playing in the minors without spending the big bucks.

#How to watch baseball?

So this is a question that we get from many new fans who are just trying to figure out what the hell is going on and why people find this game so fascinating. I'll get the elephant in the room out of the way, yes there are some ""boring"" parts of watching baseball on TV. The camera fans to a batter spitting and adjusting his gloves, the pitcher adjusts his crotch then licks his fingers, random shots of a bored looking manager, etc. When you are actually at the ballpark you can be watching where the catcher and fielders set up to try to predict the pitch that is coming (read *The Hidden Language of Baseball* by Paul Dickson for some great insight into how to interpret this), but on TV it's not usually the case. This is where I have some suggestions for new fans trying to get into it.

First off, if you are looking for just a relaxing day, embrace the slow pace with a beer and veg out on the couch while watching. It's meant to be slow and relaxing (until it gets tense and exciting, usually with runners on). Seriously, when was the last time you just sat and did nothing? Mid July afternoon games are a perfect way to reach that zen of half-consciousness, until something happens to get you sucked into the action.

Another option to stay engaged is keeping score. I find keeping score relaxing and looking back through a scorebook can be fun to see what you were doing a few years ago (except for that damn unfinished scorecard from 2015 where A-Rod hit the most predictable home run in Twins-Yankees history and I sent my scorecard flying to the other side of the room). As NPR once put it, keeping score is a knowledge making activity, and if you have the time and patience for it it is a great way to learn the game. There are [a couple](https://teachbaseball.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/how-to-keep-an-official-scorebook/) different guides to [keeping score](http://www.baseball-almanac.com/scoring.shtml), and most scorebooks/cards will have a brief example of how to do so. If you have any questions, the Around the Horn thread is a great place to ask!

Gamethreads are another way to get together with other baseball fans and pass the time between pitches, especially in team subs you get to know the regulars and conversations start to wonder away from baseball at times throughout the game, and that's fine. Baseball is an excuse to enjoy a summer day.

For those that want to actually understand what is going on during that time, though, there are some options. *Watching Baseball Smarter* by Zack Hample (who despite his reputation on this subreddit knows some stuff and actually pops in from time to time to comment on different things) is a good starting place for new fans. *Baseball for Dummies* and *The Complete Idiots Guide to Baseball* are also good starting points for those willing to sit and read for a little bit.

If it helps, I wrote two posts on /r/minnesotatwins to help newcomers understand some of the nuances of the game:

 - [Watching the Count](https://old.reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/ilxdn9/cardith_explains_watching_the_count/)

#Where to watch highlights and game recaps.

There are many many places to see highlights and game recaps, this is not an exhaustive list, but is a good start.

For highlights, bigger highlights will often be posed here on r/baseball a few minutes after they occur, [if you wish to post them please familiarize yourself with the subreddit rules.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/wiki/rules) They also appear relatively quickly on MLB.com in each games Gameday area. For a pretty slick collection of highlights from across MLB, https://baseball.theater/ is a great place to exclusively watch highlights.

There are a few ways to get great game recaps. If you have MLB Network, every day *Quick Pitch* is an hour-long show that recaps every game from the previous day. It usually starts after MLB Tonight (about 10pm EDT) or whatever game MLB Network is showing finishes up, and runs until 10am EDT the next day. MLB.com also puts out recaps of every game by the next morning, usually a 2-5 minutes quick rundown of highlights that can be found on the game recap. It also puts out *Fastcast* videos on youtube and their website every morning which has a brief rundown of all the games from the previous day. [Here's an example of a Fastcast from two seasons ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_hWCizeisY)

If you want one concise place to see most of these, /u/efitz11 has been amazing the last few seasons and posted video links to every game recap and fastcast in the daily Around the Horn thread. [Here's an example.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/992tep/general_discussion_around_the_horn_82118/e4kfyr3/?st=jtbm738k&sh=24d221b5) I am unsure if they plan to continue it this year, but it would be surely appreciated!

#TL;DR Finding what you enjoy about the game.

When it boils down to it, baseball is about finding entertainment and enjoyment, and don't let anyone try to tell you how to enjoy baseball. If you want nothing to do with statistical analysis and just want to enjoy what's going on on the field, don't let anyone tell you you aren't enough of a fan, and if you want to dissect a player into their strengths and components using statcast and advanced metrics don't let anyone tell you you're reading into the game too much. You can follow one team, and only one team, or you can follow multiple teams, don't let anyone tell you you're not a true fan for wearing another team's gear or enjoying their games. You might enjoy bat flips and flamboyance, or reserved speedy home run trots. You might not even enjoy physically watching a game (especially not if your team isn't playing), but find yourself loving keeping track of your team through the season and tracking your players or maybe just the thrill of the standings race and scoreboard watching or maybe you just love all the numbers that get thrown around and arguing about their relevancy. That's okay, eventually I believe enjoyment of the game itself will come, but even if it doesn't, the long baseball season is still creating a place of enjoyment for you, *and that's what matters*. If you have any questions, once again, feel free to ask them in our daily Around the Horn thread, or below in the comments, or if you really want to feel free to PM with questions and I'd be happy to answer.

So watch games this week and join in the discussion here, you'll naturally find yourself gravitating towards certain players or teams and enjoying different aspects of the game. Baseball is a long season, find what you enjoy, stick to it, dwell on it, and enjoy it.

At the same time coffee is promoted as the cure for fatty liver, the influencers are promoting it. It might be true, just like the thought that beer is good for treating kidney stones. However, the overall impact of alcohol is bad on the kidneys, including that of a beer. Beer can help in taking out the kidney stones and also in taking out the whole kidneys as well!

Now, we can find a lot of companies and startups working in the coffee sector, trying to move Indians to coffee culture. All those who are online are made to believe that coffee is a cure for fatty liver and then there is news that 80% IT workers have fatty liver, exactly the demography that the coffee companies are targeting.  How convenient!

It is just like in 90ies, at the time of Indian market liberation, when we were made to believe that couple of pegs after dinner are good for health to remove the taboo on alcohol. Even now, celebrities promote red wine as being good for the skin, when it is not.

I posted my thoughts in this group because it seems to me like marketing from startups. It could be a great marketing lesson about how to pitch a product as a solution to a problem and then make everyone believe that they have this problem. Not that I support this type of misinformation.

My use case is for an EDC on the larger side, for daily carry to a hospital setting, including a laptop and some surgical equipment, but also a carry-on for flights.  It’s usually not at full capacity but I like having the extra flex room.   

My last bag was an Osprey Contrail Day from 2012 which I wore out with EDC used for similar purposes.   

I have not experienced the back digging issues I’ve read about (I’m 6 foot and wear it high).  Although I do think the straps could be more comfortable, they are not uncomfortable. 

I love the top design access to both the yoke pocket (sunglasses for me) and the front pocket (wallet, other small things). 

The vertical zip admin pocket - I do not feel comfortable keeping important things as a few times I forgot to zip it and things fell out when I move the bag.  I keep some snacks and other things not needed frequently in there. 

I’ve changed from keeping my computer in the side laptop compartment to the main compartment to keep the top orientation and from frequently changing the bag’s orientation to access it.  If I’m working at a coffee shop and the pockets are open, I don’t want to change orientation to get out my laptop.  I also want my laptop, notepad and folder in the same sleeve.  I do keep the laptop in the side laptop sleeve for air travel when I want more padding. 

I like the top internal zip pocket in the main compartment where I keep secure items (money, passport). 

My only complaint is the sleeve in the main compartment is too loose and floppy.   

The water bottle pockets are as described by others, great, and they are big with nice stretch. 

It stands well on its own.  Overall built of very good quality.  Stays clean, seems durable. 

For a very secret pocket I have used the zipped pocket between the laptop sleeve and the back padding, where the metal sheet is placed.  In travel situations I put cash or my apple airtag there as its very difficult for someone searching the bag to come across that zipper compartment. 

I ordered both the CTB20 and CTB26, and felt the 26 was better for my use case.

Crazy enough to work or just plain crazy?,"I emailed my (D) Rep this morning and asked her to introduce a bill to put Trump on the 100 bill AND save social security. With specifics. I said to raise the cap on salary for which you and your employer have to contribute immediately and have an annual review to consider raising the cap every year. 

There is a lot of room to be creative with funding social security. After I sent it (and the coffee kicked in) I thought of other options. Raise the cap by 2% every year. Raise the cap to 200K immediately, AND add an additional requirement that those making 10 million or more (wages, bonus AND tips) have to pay 0.5% in. 

I don't expect this to work. I hope it will cause some more fractions in the Trump world. They'll have to address it. Trump may want to be on the bill enough to tell them to pass it. People like Russell Voight will hate it and might piss Trump off enough to fire him. 

Trump may end up getting credit for saving social security, which would be annoying, but I think I could live with it. I'm already living with the woman during the 2020 campaign who said she was voting for him because he got her health insurance. THAT WAS OBAMACARE YOU FREAKING GENIUS!

Mostly this idea is about causing rifts in the Trump coalition in congress and between him and the Federalist society. Political theater is about widening the cracks in the regime. It helps.

this plant is rather old and means a lot to us. my grandma didnt have space to bring it inside this winter and decided to leave it outside. she wrapped it up in a fabric id describe as potato or coffee grounds sacks. we unwrapped it now that theres no temp under 0°C and the plant looks very dead.


the leaves are white and look crispy, the stems look green and the base is green as well. the newest leaf is also completely dead looking. is it possible it would grow new shoots if we cut it off completely? or just the dead parts? if we support it with lots of sun and fertilizer? or is it too far gone?

While I do have to work part time for rent, rely on public transit, and refrain from luxuries (eat out, daily coffee, travel), **I recognize that I am privileged and can afford a safety net.**

I met my friend when she was asking for donations for a non-profit she started that tries to build renewable energy greenhouses. We became good friends while working on the project together. 

Because of ADHD and anxiety, my friend got kicked out of many jobs, making it hard for her to get hired. She doesn't have a car so she can't do Uber/Doordash. Her elderly mom is blind and relies on my friend's care. My friend's mom lives with her siblings who can't contribute anything.

She sings on the streets to get some money. Her only stable source of income is the $1,000 monthly section 8 voucher. Each month, pays $250 for rent and utilities, $50 for transit costs to visit mom, $300 for both of their groceries, $200 for her mom's property taxes (payment plan), the remaining goes to her prescription, mom's utilities, and smoking.

She occasionally asks me for $10 or $20 when the food, train, or utility prices gets unexpectedly high. She's going through programs to quit smoking, lose weight, and get her mental health in check so she borrowed $500 from me.

She says getting a job will take away from her time to focus on the non-profit greenhouse. She plans on paying me back by using a small portion of the non-profit grants (if and when she gets the funding) as operating expenses since I helped with the solar wiring design. I am less worried about being paid back and more **worried about her lack of long-term financial independence for both herself and her non-profit.**

Her backstory of a ""master assassin"" who got bored and wanted to pick up dancing, and raise funds to get out of the city was far too skilled for a level 1 character, but since our group was casual, I let that slide. Every time a talked up her past achievements, she'd chime in with ""damn right, that's me!"" I honestly felt like she needed constant validation, and I was becoming her enabler.

Putting that aside, the character has shown, on multiple occasions, that she only listens in a conversations to gather information on them, so that she knows how to best ""screw them over"" or ""piss them off"", but she keeps her own secrets very close to her chest, and when someone tries to that to HER, they end up on her ""to-kill"" list.

This is NOT, as far as I can tell, making anyone else's experience worse other than mine, but, in my experience, an apathetic assassin that gets blind stinking drunk every night and just wants to spend mornings hungover sipping coffee and not interacting with the world has NO business being in the campaign, but we've been playing for months, and nearly at the end of it, so here I am, trying to write scenarios to end her storyline (so please, spare me ""have a session 0.5"");

Essentially, she could steal a horse, shape shift into someone else, and leave. She doesn't need money to leave, she just SAYS she does (that, or the player hasn't figured that out yet). The only thing keeping her from leaving is ""then the plot doesn't happen"" (even though retiring PCs is a thing). There's some thing about her becoming ""attached"" to her new party members, and, more so, the urchin kids, and the death of one of them shook her, but she's still the same self-centred, sadistic, and hedonistic character at the end of the day.

I'm trying to create drama by reintroducing the assassin guild she was a part of (The Unseen) that are trying get her back into the fold, but she's being all ""Nah, fuck off, mate! Why are so obsessed with me, anyway? You a boner for me or something XD?"" Then, there's a issue of the consequences for being an assassin and killing nobles, which she admits she did for (my much more violent version of) The Unseen ""until she got bored"", but without established evidence, how can she be held responsible for that?  
  
So what does that leave me with; Changeling is an asshole to everyone, and then, when she secures the gold, gets off scot free? Boring! Is she trying to ""grow a heart"" with her attachment to the part of the urchins? I doubt it. Her only actual ""friend"" in the party, the barbarian, recently died, and it's established they just came together as business partners through blackmail; she saw him shape-shift, she thought he was another changeling, she discovers he's lycanthrope, she says ""be me muscle, or the whole city knows your dirty secret!"" That Barbarian's player has now replaced said character with his own mother, and despite all the rogues actions, the mother is still holding on to ""My son trusted her"", unaware of the blackmail angle. 

The problem, I feel, is this is a very anti-social PC created by an incredibly anti-social person who just wants to be left alone to her art, and who just so happens to be an intrinsic part of our group's clique. I've talked to her about this, I've told her I find her character toxic, and she deflected saying ""you were angry as a barbarian, and I couldn't tell if it was real or not, I'm doing the same thing!"" (even though I have an acting background, these barbarian rage moments were sparse, and I always clarified I was okay after each session.

1j3c20r,https://www.reddit.com/r/NclexUSRNs/comments/1j3c20r/passed_in_92_license_posted_but_no_email/,"PASSED in 92, license posted but No email.","I walked out of the test center yesterday a total mess tears streaming down my face, hands shaking, absolutely convinced I’d failed the NCLEX. At some point during the test, I felt utterly defeated. The screen kept throwing tough priority questions and SATA after SATA at me like it was trying to break me. “Select ALL that apply”.... those words alone sent my heart racing. The questions were tricky I wasn’t even sure nursing school had prepared me for them. I freaked out, nerves on overdrive, wondering, “What does this even mean? Am I doomed?” And yet, here I am, still in shock: I PASSED.
Let me back up. The lead-up to the NCLEX was a marathon of anxiety. I’ve been grinding for months—practice tests, Naxlex questions, coffee fueled study sessions where I had to wrestle with prioritization questions and med calculations until my brain got used to it. Everyone warned me about SATA questions, those infamous multi-answer monsters that nursing students dread. “They’re a good sign,” some said. “They mean you’re getting the hard stuff!” But when you’re in the thick of it, staring at a screen with six options and no clue which ones to pick, it doesn’t feel “good” it feels like a personal attack lol. 

Test day hit, and I was a bundle of nerves. I tried to breathe through the jitters, and sat down at that computer like I was facing a firing squad. The first few questions were manageable, but then it ramped up. Priority questions... Those “who do you see first?” scenarios—started piling on, each one trickier than the last. And the SATAs? Oh, they were relentless. “Select all that apply: symptoms of hypokalemia,” “interventions for a post-op patient,” “complications of diabetes.” My mind spun. I had to hover over the options, second-guessing every click. Was I overthinking it? Missing something obvious? By the time the test shut off at 92 questions, I was a wreck. I stumbled out, tears welling up, convinced those tough questions were proof I’d failed.
I couldn’t shake the panic. What did it mean that I got slammed with priority and SATA questions? I’d heard the rumors—if you’re getting harder questions, it might mean you’re doing well, because the NCLEX adapts to your level. But in that moment, all I felt was defeat. I called a friend, sobbing, “It was so hard—there’s no way I passed.” She told me to chill and try the Pearson Vue trick, but I was too scared. Hours later, after some stress-eating and pacing, I finally checked my quick results. “PASSED.” I stared at the screen, refreshed it three times, and then screamed louder than I care to admit. I did it. I’m a nurse.
If you’ve taken the NCLEX or you’re prepping for it, you’ve probably heard the buzz about SATA questions. They’re notorious for striking fear into nursing students’ hearts—and trust me, I get it now. But here’s what I’ve learned: those tough priority and SATA questions aren’t there to ruin you; they’re a sign the test is pushing you, testing your critical thinking. Yeah, they’re brutal. Yeah, they make you feel like you’re drowning. But if you’re seeing them, it might just mean you’re rising to the challenge—even if you don’t feel it at the time.
To anyone out there staring down the NCLEX barrel: I’ve been where you are. The freakouts, the doubts, the “what does this mean?!” spiral it’s all real. Those tough questions don’t define your worth or your future. I cried leaving the test center, convinced I’d bombed, but I passed. You can too. Keep pushing, trust your gut, and when you see that “PASSED” on your screen, every tear and late-night study session will feel like a badge of honor. I’m a nurse now, and I wouldn’t trade this wild ride for anything.
This version keeps your personal experience front and center, emphasizes the emotional highs and lows, and ties in the specific challenge of tough priority and SATA questions. It also offers insight and encouragement for others, making it relatable and uplifting.",1,1741098697.0,NclexUSRNs,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Context: So a little back story-ish? My best friend (f) and I (m) became friends around this time of the month last year. I don't really remember how we became friends—we just clicked lang talaga. At first wala talaga akong feelings and wala rin akong plan to have feelings for her or anything, cuz I have female friends naman talaga and sobrang recent lang talaga 'yong breakup niya with her ex kausap. But as the time goes by, I became more fond of her, grew really close, and then we became best friends. At first, madalas kami nag d-discord call with friends (around 3-5x a week), kasi sabay-sabay kami gumagawa ng research. After ng school year na 'yon, we were still in touch with each other, call sometimes to have chika and laro. 

Fast forward sa present, gr.11 na kami, we're not classmates anymore but parehas kami ng strand. I don't know when kami nag start na naging sobrang close, cuz since January/February, every night kami nag c-call sa discord just to do assignments, notes, review, study, laro, watch movies, and chikahan. In these calls, nag s-share kami ng secrets namin, story about our lives before we met each other, stuff like that. BUT HOLD ON, ito ang favorite part ko, it's when we just make tambay sa call pag wala kaming magawa or mapag-usapan cuz we're always together, we're just there, either pinapakita niya sa'kin 'yong super cute af niyang pamangkins or iniispam niya ako tiktok vids and ig reels. Ito pa, last week Saturday, we jogged with our friends, 8 of us in total. 3 of them are couples so sila ang magkakasama mag jog. Me and her were single and nakiki third wheel so kami ang magkasama mag jog, or so our plan is. From 6:00 am – 8:00 am, we did nothing but walk and yap—for 2 hours! AND I LOVE EVERY MOMENT OF IT. I held her bag, matched her pace, held her flower, took photos and videos. After the jog, we went to a near dunkin donut shop with our friends and she had coffee. We sat next together, and for another 2 hours, we just yapped. After that another yapping session, we went home together and I texted her, ""thank you sa pagsama"", stuff like that, and she hearts my message and sent a thank you message and a heart avatar sticker.

Previous Attempts: Now, kaya I can't confess is that heart sticker and stuff is normally sinisend niya talaga as a joke, kaya idk if it means something or wala. Additionally, madalas niya pa sinasabi na I'm just like her brother or parang kapatid daw kami both, which is sobrang ouchy kasi I don't know if she likes me romantically. Madalas naman me magbigay ng signs, like mga medyo lowkey flirts and such. I think na n-notice niya, I'm not sure though, cause most of the time she doesn't flirt back or just completely ignore that sign. However, may mga times talaga na I feel like na parang she does like me and hinihintay niya talaga ako mag confess. It's not that na takot ako mag confess or I'm scared of being rejected, takot lang ako na if I confess, she'll reject me and we'll stop being friends. I don't want her to think na I became friends with her just because I like her, when I really got to know who she is, that's when I fell, and I fell seriously hard. Haysss, I just can't imagine my life without her na, alam na niya halos buong buhay ko, and even secrets na bilang lang sa daliri ko ang peeps na may alam.",1,1741098407.0,adviceph,3,1.0,False

He is 36 yo who is actually married to his wife and has  4 yo kid. After talking a bit more, we exchanged our numbers and left.

Yesterday he messaged me if I wanna meet. He said he really enjoyed my company and finds me cute. He says that since he is married we wont have anythings serious between us. He wants to meet me for a hookup and if im not comgortable with that then just as friends.

I am attracted to him and dont mind the age gap(should I?) but the problem is that he is married with kids.

I have a friend Darwin 26m that is depressed, this has been going on for more than 3 years. When he first told us (my friend Luke and I) we begged him to go to therapy or tell his parents so that they could help him find a therapist, I reached out to the university therapist but he didn’t want to go. Since then, he told me to not talk to him about therapy anymore. I think it all started when his girlfriend broke up with him but we weren’t really close back then (5 years ago)

I try being supportive but what can I do? He sent a message last year insinuating he’s going to end it so I called him to talk to him, begging him not to do anything until Luke went to his house to calm him down.

We finished our degree and Darwin went back to his parent’s house (about an hour away). My mother in law lives not for away so last time I went there I invited him for coffee at her house, his response was “thanks, that’s nice of you, but no thanks”. TBH I felt a bit hurt but I didn’t say anything cause I am very careful about what to say around him.

I also invited him to my house with our other friends and wanted to do lunch instead of dinner so that he doesn’t drive so late at night, again he refused. 

He only joins us **sometimes** when we play online and he sounds fine but we don’t really talk about his situation since only Luke and I know.

Luke’s birthday is coming up and we both reached out for him to come and celebrate. In the meantime, I had my daughter and Luke got a girlfriend. Luke is so excited since he really wanted to be in a real relationship and I am so happy for him so I told him to bring his girlfriend so that we could meet her. He said he is worried that if I bring my daughter, he brings his girlfriend and one of our other friends brings her boyfriend that Darwin will think that everyone is happy but him. Me on the other hand, I thought that maybe if he sees that Luke got a girlfriend when he started his job that he will see that he will find someone one day without really looking. 

I don’t know, maybe since he is depressed he will probably see things in the negative way?",1,1741098184.0,AITAH,7,0.67,False

I have been researching and watching youtube reviews on various bean to coffee machines and the choices are endless. I drink, double shots, long shots, americanos, and lattes. At first I thought the SMEG would be a great option due to it's sleek exterior and it looking user friendly. Read not great reviews so decided to continue my search. My friend has the Terra Kaffe, but have also read mixed reviews. I found the Jura line and was going to pull the trigger on the ena 4, but if I'm spending that much money I'd like a steamer option on the side.

Now that I have a better understanding of what I want, is there a machine that has it all? Sleek, compact (living in an apartment), option for a decaf hopper/ compartment (delonghi rivelia is out I'm in the US), option to steam milk, and price range is up to $2k. Counter space is limited (11 in × 13 in × 19 in) would be ideal. Many thanks!",2,1741098149.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

by c.w. cobblestone



When I woke up Saturday morning, my right hand was cramped after spending half the night writing 2,000 times in my best cursive:



*Good maids don’t get hair in their bosses’ food/ Good maids don’t get hair in their bosses’ food/ Good maids don’t get hair in their bosses’ food/ Good maids don’t get hair in their bosses’ food/ Good maids don’t get hair in their bosses’ food/ Good maids don’t get hair in their bosses’ food/ Good maids don’t get hair in their bosses’ food/ Good maids don’t get hair in their bosses’ food/ Good maids don’t get hair in their bosses’ food*



Since it was Saturday and I knew everyone would be sleeping in later than usual, I puttered around the house knocking out a few quiet chores. As I worked, I felt thankful that I’d chosen corner time and writing as my punishment rather than three days of starvation. Having picked the first option, my penalty was already over, whereas if I’d chosen no food, I wouldn’t have been allowed to eat for another two days.



Still, that didn’t make it any less embarrassing when I presented the lines to my masters along with their coffee a few seconds after they called for me. Liz didn’t even bother to look at my hard work; when I handed her the papers filled with my neat handwriting, she immediately tossed them in the bedside trash bin.



“Next time I find hair in my food, you’ll be writing ten thousand lines, standing in the corner for eight hours — AND you’ll go on a starvation diet, maybe for a damned week. Do you hear me, maid?”



“Yes, Mistress.”



“I don’t like hair in my goddamn food.”



“I know, Mistress, I’m so sorry.”



Cody sipped his coffee and sighed. “I have to pee,” he drawled. “Go in the bathroom and wait, Mirabella”



I curtseyed and obeyed, and as I knelt near the toilet I wondered if my master would ever tire of humiliating me. Perhaps in a few years, I thought, but not anytime soon — he was enjoying his second chance in life too much to curb his sadistic thirsts.



When my master finally got out of bed and sauntered to the bathroom, Liz again accompanied him and watched from the doorway as I gulped down every drop of the urine that was gifted to me. This time, there was no applause, and Cody didn’t take away a check mark; I thanked him profusely for the honor of drinking his piss, to which Liz sniffed derisively and muttered, “What a little sissy,” before they walked away hand-in-hand.



After brushing my teeth and washing my face, I took care of more quiet chores. On weekend mornings, since I didn’t need to wake the girls, I’d wait until everyone came downstairs before taking their individual breakfast orders. 



Brooke and Mia were excited about their equestrian competition and were up earlier than normal for a Saturday. The elder sibling kindly asked for bacon and eggs, whereas her sister snapped her fingers and barked, “Eggs Benedict, maid, and hurry up; I’m hungry.” Brooke looked at me and rolled her eyes, but otherwise didn’t admonish her sister for being so bitchy with me. Such behavior had become normal, and as long as Mia didn’t treat me too badly, nobody seemed to care anymore. 



Breakfast was dominated by horse talk, and when Mia mentioned how much she wanted to beat “That little witch Lisa Carrington” in the dressage competition, Liz slapped her head and moaned.



“Shit, I forgot — Mrs. Carrington will be there to see her daughter,” she said. “Mirabella, you’ll have to come with us.”



My face lit up. “Really? T-thank you.”



“We’ll have to act like we’re still together, and Cody is just there to see the girls,” Liz said.



“Eww, we have to pretend the maid is our stepdad again? Seriously?” Mia curled her lip. “Why can’t we just tell your stupid boss the truth?”



“Because my stupid boss would fire me in a minute,” Liz snapped back. “Now, you’re going to play along and pretend you like Walt, and that’s all I want to hear about it. It’s not gonna kill you to be nice to him for a few hours.”



Mia smirked at me. “Well, well, it’s your lucky day — you get to pretend to be a normal person for a change.”



“Just don’t get cute,” Liz warned. “Seriously, you need to bend over backward to treat Walt like he’s your stepdad when we’re in public. Unless you want me to lose my job.”



“Okay, okay.” Mia huffed and stared at me with her eyes narrowed. “But don’t forget who you work for.”



“Y-yes, Miss.” I curtseyed and resumed my position, standing at attention while the family’s conversation drifted to other matters.



After breakfast, I changed into one of the few male outfits I had left in my wardrobe other than sweat suits, and the family piled in the minivan to head to Nirvana Stables. Brooke and Mia chattered nonstop from the backseat, and, in keeping up the ruse, I sat in the front next to Liz while Cody huddled in the far back behind the girls. I felt guilty riding up front while my master was forced to ride in the rear, which told me how deeply my submission had set in.



When we arrived at the stables, the girls headed straight to their horses, while Liz and I held hands as we walked to the arena, with Cody bringing up the rear. It was beyond strange with the tables being turned like that, even if everyone involved knew it was just a front. 



As the three of us sat in the bleachers eating popcorn awaiting the competition to start, I recognized Liz’s boss as she made her way toward us smiling.



“Hello, there!” she called with a friendly wave. Liz squeezed my hand, and I wasn’t sure whether she was just nervous or trying to wordlessly tell me, “Don’t fuck this up.”



I took the initiative to open my arms to give Mrs. Carrington a hug. “Nice to see you again,” I said.



“You, too, Walter, you look good,” she said before breaking our embrace and turning to my master. “And you must be Cody.”



“Yes, Ma’am, it’s nice to meet you.” He extended his hand, but Mrs. Carrington ignored it, leaning in and giving him a hard squeeze. 



“Listen, I just want you to know I appreciate your service, and everything you’ve done for our country,” the fifty-something woman said. “It’s not every day I get to meet a real American hero.”



Cody blushed. “Aww, thanks, I just did what I had to do, Ma’am.”



“Well, a lot of people are proud of you,” Mrs. Carrington said. She smiled at Liz and me. “And you two are just great, the way you’re helping him get back on his feet.”



“Hey, like you said, he’s a hero.” I grinned at my master. “Whatever he needs, we’re happy to help out.”



Mrs. Carrington placed her hand on Cody’s shoulder. “Well, thank you again for your service. Now, I’m going back to my seat; I just wanted to come by and say hi.”



With that, Liz’s boss made her way down the bleachers, while Liz, Cody and I sighed with relief that the ruse had worked. When we sat back down, Liz pretended she was reaching for her popcorn and purposely brushed her hand across her lover’s cock. He winked at her, and I sat there feeling like an idiot.



The equestrian event started, and at first, things looked great for both Brooke and Mia, who led in their respective age groups by wide margins. But during the jumping competition, Rocket’s saddle suddenly shifted, and Brooke was thrown from the horse. Everyone in the arena stood and gasped, although, luckily, the teen immediately popped up and ran to bridle her beloved Rocket.



When the competition was over, Mia had pocketed a blue ribbon, although her sister was disqualified after falling from her horse. I could tell Brooke was steaming mad as we walked back to the minivan, and as soon as we were safely inside, she lit into me.



“That was YOUR FAULT!!! The strap on the saddle wasn’t tight like it’s supposed to be, and I know I didn’t loosen it!!”



“Miss, I … I didn’t—”



“QUIET, MAID!! THAT’S FIVE CHECK MARKS!!!”



I bowed my head, feeling the glares of everyone in the family raining down on me, even as pellets of rain started dotting the windshield. Within minutes, the raindrops had turned into a major thunderstorm.



After Liz had driven a safe distance from the stables, she pulled into a gas station and nodded at me.



“Get in the back and let Cody sit up here,” she ordered. 



“Yes, Mistress.”



“You should make him walk home,” Brooke snapped.



“Ooh, yeah, make him walk!” Mia seconded the motion.



Cody smirked at me as I slipped out of the minivan, giving up my shotgun seat. “Dang, sissy, how far would you say we are from home?”



“Um, about ten miles, Master.”



“Then, you’d better walk fast if you want to make it home in time to start cooking dinner.” He snorted. “Damn, Mirabella, it must suck to be you — ten miles is a long way to walk in the pouring rain.”



Everyone other than Brooke laughed at Cody’s cruelty. She shot me a hateful glance just before the door slammed shut and the minivan pulled away.

1j3bpsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1j3bpsl/my_wife_had_an_affair_when_my_mum_died_and_blames/,My wife had an affair when my mum died and blames me for the relationship breakdown,"Hi all,

I (30m) started posting some of these incidents in AITAH but it soon became clear that in some of these cases she very clearly is TAH and there's no point in even asking.
So I've come here just to list all the effed up things that have happened to me in the final months of 2024.
I anticipate this will be very long, have fun.

So for some context

In late 2023 my wife and I bought a house and I was spending a lot of time for a couple of months working on the house almost every evening and weekend I could spare. 
During this time my wife started going out with some new friends including this guy J. 
Randomly one evening she looks a bit funny and says to me, ""I don't trust myself around him"".
I hear this, my heart sinks a bit but I feel like we have a strong relationship and I tell her ""I trust you not to do anything stupid, just be sensible about what time and how you spend time with him"".
She liked this and we moved on, but I decided to keep an eye on the situation.
She started spending more and more time with him and these new friends, going out and getting drunk while I was working late on the house.
It was starting to make me uncomfortable and eventually I said so. I didn't ask for anything, I just expressed my feelings.
She said, she understood but they're just friends and there's nothing to be worried about.
They keep hanging out until one day his partner, a woman married to another man...., forbade him from speaking to my wife because she was jealous.
So he ghosted my wife and she got really upset.
It hurt me to see how upset she was for two reasons,
1. My wife is upset, that's upsetting
2. She's so upset it feels weird and she's acting like a breakup

She asked me to proof read a message she wanted to send and I read a bit and had to put it down, I said "" this is a breakup message, I refuse to do this""
She remained adamant they were just friends and nothing more.
I accused her of having an emotional affair, again she denied it and was adamant they were just friends and that I need to get over this.

Some weeks later J comes back on the scene having broken up with his previous gf. My wife says she's going to talk to him but be very boundaried. I tell her that I'm uncomfortable with all of this, if she's going to see him she should be careful.

A week or two later she comes stumbling in at 5am, I ask where she's been and she explains that she has been out with J, went back to his place at around 2am and they 'played guitar'.

I was hurt and upset, this was the antithesis of everything we discussed. I said ""you can't do that"" to which my wife took great offense accusing me of controlling her and being misogynistic.
To be clear, I never forbade her from seeing him, I never tried to tell her what to do beyond please be careful and don't do anything silly and please respect me. That time I said ""you can't do that"" was the first and only time I specifically said what she could and couldn't do.
And to me, it's obvious I wasn't controlling her I was just not saying the quiet part out loud which is "" you can't do that unless you want to ruin our relationship ""

She is adamant nothing happened, and weirdly I believe her. The issue for me is that she did the opposite of what we both agreed, she disrespected me and my feelings, and she is putting our relationship in jeopardy.
To her the issue is that I tried to control her by being upset, and that I'm putting restrictions on her. She pointed out she's a grown ass woman and she can spend time with her friends if she wants to. My being upset about it is a mode of control and I need to stop.

In principle I have no problem with her seeing her friends, but this guy makes me uncomfortable.

So that all happened, we were on the rocks, she is clearly having an emotional affair at the very least but adamantly refuses to acknowledge it. I'm trying desperately to find a way to move forward and recover our relationship if we can.

Then, October 2024. My mum died suddenly.
I won't go too much into it but it happened, very sudden, shocking, it sucks. My dad died when I was young so a lonely time as well.
This is where my wife's behaviour started to seriously turn, I'm going to list the major events as I remember them in the order they happened. I will also try to list areas where I was less than perfect but to be perfectly honest, I don't think there are many. Like really, I have to keep checking myself - surely it wasn't all so one sided, surely I contributed meaningfully to this.
Just doesn't seem to be the case.

Anyway here goes.

The day after my mum died, we are at the pub with a friend, we are talking about it all. My friend asks my wife how she's doing and she says "" I'm worried everyone is going to forget that my mum died ""
For context her mum passed away 3-4 years ago from a long contracted period of illness. It spanned over COVID and lock down. I lived in their house with them over all of lockdown and helped look after her mum, watching her die and taking care of her for over a year.

My wife had been dealing with this tragic and difficult loss for some time, so I had some sympathy to her reaction. But bottom line, it's a shitty thing to say to your partner who lost their mum one day ago, that you're concerned you're not going to get as much attention any more. That my loss will overshadow hers.
It speaks volumes and sets up what is to come.

A day later she says she's going to go and see this J guy I mentioned above. The one I'm really uncomfortable with.
I made it very clear that I am uncomfortable with this and now is not the time to be testing me like this. I know he's just your friend and there's nothing actually happening (I'm an idiot), but this does upset me and I don't need to deal with this right now. I'd appreciate it if she didn't go.
She said she understood but not to worry, this is the last time she's going to see him really. Their relationship has petered out more or less so it will just be the occasional coffee which is all she's going for.
Oh and they had plans to go see a jazz band in a few weeks time but she'll cancel that on account of the funeral. She's barely going to see him, so don't worry.
I said it was fine. I saw it as, if she's being truthful then I can accept the cost of one more uncomfortable period if the payoff is they really do just leave each other alone for a while. She went and came back a couple hours later, no big deal.

So the following week we had a spa trip booked, I bought it for her for Christmas. We decided to still go in spite of everything because, why not. I need it.
It was great. Had a lovely time, reconnected, I was able to relax and de-stress a bit. 
But on the last day, we're in a hot tub together sharing a cocktail and she's on her phone. She's messaging J and arranging to meet the next day.
I took offense and said ""I thought you weren't seeing eachother any more?""
""It's just to study, I'm falling behind on my thesis.""

So the next day she gets up early and leaves, we agree she'll be back at lunch. I'm very unhappy about all of this and just basically sulk all morning. I leave my phone upstairs and try to get on with my day as best I can, waiting for her to come home and talk about it.
3pm comes and goes. I take a nap. 5PM comes and goes...
I check my phone, a couple messages and a couple missed calls. Apparently she decided to stay out for lunch and asked if it was ok. When I didn't reply she decided to stay out for dinner and drinks too.
She didn't get home until after I went to bed. I spent the whole evening feeling miserable and hurt. I don't need this.
She comes home and I confront her asking if she thought any of that was ok.
Turns out it's all my fault because I didn't reply to her and my lack of immediate response was me emotionally blackmailing her to come home.
It really wasn't, I just didnt want to have my phone on me and was expecting her to be home at the agreed time.
Maybe a little silly and selfish in my part. Maybe. But I'm grieving and she's already pushed my boundaries, I needed some alone time to deal with it. I had no idea I was emotionally blackmailing her.
So anyway, she stays out all day with the person that makes me uncomfortable, days after my mum died, days after she promised she wouldn't, and I'm the asshole for not keeping my phone on me in case she decided to change her mind.
Great.

A week goes by and it's the day before we're due to leave for my home town, ready for the funeral in a few days.
She asks me if we can hold off going for one extra day so she can go to this jazz thing with J. I say, ""wtf? you said that wasn't happening? That's why you saw him earlier because you weren't doing this.""
She says she knows but she really wants to go.
I confront her and say "" I really don't feel like I'm your top priority""
""No, you're not my top priority""
""... Please elaborate""
""Well, I just don't see it as a hierarchy. Everyone's in a circle around me and you're all equal priority. You, J, etc..""
""Right, but I'm your husband and my mum just died. Does that not put me ahead of anyone else?""
""No."" Looking dead in my eyes. No.

Fine! Go to your jazz thing, idgaf.

She says ""might as well, the damage is already done by me even asking, right?""

Yeah. The damage is already done.

I can't believe what she said to me, so cold, so heartless, so unempathetic, so selfish.
Btw, this woman is a qualified therapist.. let that sink in. Hope you don't get her as your therapist, good lord.

So she fucks off the next day and I delay my departure for her social plans.
I contemplated going down without her but the ensuing drama and questions from family would not be worth it. It was my mum's funeral after all, not my marriage's.

The funeral goes fine, the week is fine. She doesn't say or do anything shitty. I focus on the funeral and family and everything and mostly not think about the fireball train wreck that is now my marriage.

On the drive home my wife decides to tell me that she thinks her ex boyfriend (from school days) is ""the one that got away.""
I'm dumbfounded because 
1. What a thing to fucking say as I drive us home from burying my mother
2. It's just patently untrue. So completely ludicrous that I'm not even bothered by the notion that she might be serious.

It is at this point that it dawns on me that she may be hurting me on purpose.

The next day we are having coffee and she says to me
""I never wanted this house, I never wanted this dog, and I don't want kids.""

Let's be clear, I did not push her to get the house or the dog. If anything she pushed for both of them but it was pretty mutual. 
She is now tearing up the entire foundation of our marriage. She is lighting fire to the entire future plans we had.
The house and dog that I poured my heart and soul into for her, for us. She never wanted apparently.
Just brutal. Savage.
She acted shocked when I started crying, ""I didn't expect it to upset you this much"" 
Incredible.
The next day I go to my friend's place and just cry on her for hours. I am in a complete state. It's all too much, overwhelming, awful, and just confusing.
Why is she being so mean? I wondered if she hated me, then I thought.. maybe she's trying to get me to break up with her.
She's clearly having an affair of some variety. My mum just died. Maybe she just doesn't want to be the person to break up with their partner when their mum died. 
Especially a partner who cared for her dying mother.
And especially because she was having an affair.
She'd be seen as such an asshole, so rather than just admitting everything and being an asshole she decided to torture me until I pulled the plug myself. Not her fault then, is it?
Anyway, that thought occurred to me. But I'm in no state to decide the fate of my marriage.
I'm grieving, I'm distraught, I'm reeling from the various harrowing incidents listed above. Barely enough time to process one before another comes along.
It may seem obvious to you and me now, but at the time I just couldn't see clearly what was happening or exactly why.
My friend gave me some advice that I didn't need to decide anything right now, that settled me.
Took some pressure off 
At around this point my perception of time gets a bit funny. Mixture of grief and brain fuckery.

So now I'm pissed at her, I don't trust her. I feel badly hurt.
She says she's going out with J again. I say I don't care. Resigned to this shitty behaviour, unable to reason with her, unable to discuss it, unable to make the call and leave.

She comes back at 4 in the morning high AF, they had taken MDMA together. The oxytocin drug.
Under the influence of this drug he confessed his feelings for her. She was totally shocked by this and said it was all a little uncomfortable.
Ok, I said. Whatever.
The next day we're driving somewhere and I really can't remember what she said but it just set me off. I think it was something along the lines of "" I don't know why you're so upset with me?""
I was furious, I was worn down, I was mistreated.
For the first time, I raised my voice. I was shouting at her. Listing all of these shitty instances that were cutting me up whilst I grieved.
I raised my hand, clenched my fist and brought it down on the steering wheel in anger. It made a dull bang noise.

This was the start of a new narrative from my wife.
The scary, aggressive husband narrative. The perfect excuse, in her eyes, to leave me without raising questions about her betrayal and complete lack of empathy.
You're scary, she said.
I was cowering in the passenger seat, she said.
You're just like my aggressive father, she said.

I tried defending myself but please remember I was in a complete mess mentally and emotionally. I started to believe her.
Maybe I did lose control, maybe I am one of those guys. Maybe I threatened her.
I thought that, yes it was an outburst, but no it wasn't threatening. I'm not a big scary person. I'm just a human being that has been deeply hurt and wounded when they're at their most vulnerable.
But maybe that's not a good enough excuse.
Maybe I crossed a line.

She sowed the seeds of doubt in my vulnerable mind.
I started doubting my memory of events, did I black out for a moment and do something really scary?

She told me that I was 'potentially abusive'. To be clear, she's not accusing me of being abusive, she's accusing me of maybe becoming abusive in the future. And she can't take that risk.
I'm not safe to have children with, you know the children she said she didn't want before I ever shouted.

I believed her.

What a monster I was. How could I be so terrible, I never thought I was like this.
No wonder she was having an affair for the last several weeks.
I shouted at her and hit my hand on the steering wheel in frustration.

She lent into it but not too far. She was manipulating me, telling me it's ok. You just need to go to therapy and sort yourself out.
As long as I'm going along with her narrative, she's all ok my side. If I ever doubt her, I'm terrible and hurtful and potentially abusive.

She decided it was time to end things, she had the get out of jail free card she wanted.

She didn't leave me for another man and emotionally abused me when my mum died, she saved herself from an potentially abusive relationship.

My greatest crime was hitting a steering wheel.

One of the last things she said to me.
She spoke with a friend of hers who had broken up with her partner of 8 years, had two wild years, and then they got back together for several years.
I asked what she meant by wild years, ""just connecting with lots of people"".
So she turns to me and says, I think we're a lot like them, you know?

I wanted to say, I bet she didn't abuse her partner. I bet she didn't hurt him when his mum died. I bet she didn't manipulate him into believing he was abusive.
And the sheer audacity of sitting there and looking to me to approve of her fucking a bunch of people for two years before I take her back.
I said nothing, she nudged me. Desperate for me to implicitly condone her actions and behaviours by giving even the slightest inkling that I might take her back when she's done fucking around.
I turned away and left. I was done.

Not two days after our official break up she declared herself in a relationship with J.
But to her family, she accused me of being aggressive and scary and forcing her to leave. She denies having had an affair, pretending that her and J are not an item.
She goes to my friends and asks them to meet her new partner J. Again, implicitly asking them to condone her actions by meeting this J guy.
My friends all refuse, and begin to cut contact with her.
They've seen what she's done. They knew what she was doing to me before I did. They won't tolerate her BS.
I love my friends.

My wife's sister knows everything, she heard it all from my wife's point of view and STILL she took 'my side'. Then she heard what I had to say.. boy was she pissed.
She told her whole family the truth, my wife tried to convince them that her sister was a liar. That she didn't understand. She's pregnant btw.
My wife just tried to turn her family against her pregnant younger sister.

In her attempts to not be seen as a terrible heartless B, that would abandon her husband when he needed her most, she turned herself into an even worse monster. An abuser according to some. A liar, a manipulated, a nasty piece of work.
Sometimes you meet your destiny on the path to avoid it.

I'm 2 months free.

I don't want to let another human being close to me like that again, but maybe that will change with time.
My therapist, and my wife's sister who's also a qualified therapist both said that she has been emotionally abusive to me.
Coercive controlling behaviour.
I don't know about that, but I know I've been treated unfairly.

Thanks for reading this far, I hope it was entertaining.
