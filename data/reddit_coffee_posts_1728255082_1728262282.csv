Dreamy pajamas and tasty coffee. Scary movies and soft puppies 



I’m reading outside with the hummingbirds. 
Would love to talk an adult about dumb things. Nostalgia, Americana, let’s time travel and time warp(the dance is cool too) and reminisce on places we only see in our dreams

Bare with me a moment things going nowhere 



troubled waters, these dogs are howling in the distance and my dogs are howling just in front of me and everyone’s afraid of the earthquakes we’ve been getting but it can’t be that bad can it?

I was here in 94 and and saw the freeways collapsed and the balconies smashed and the apartments sinking into the ground. 

California dreaming? I have the worst sleep. I take melatonin and I have the weirdest dreams. Always I’m in a bust station or a train station or moving though a casino like an ant on a sugar trail. 

Drunk as drunk on turpentine. 

But I found out Neruda is a piece of so maybe we don’t quote him tonight. 

My dog stepped on a bee and somehow they both lived. Well obviously rhe dog but I managed to get the bee to a hummingbird feeder and he drank up and then flew off. 

I’m afraid of those really blue nights I haven’t seen since I was sixteen coming home to an empty place and I’m outside waiting for that blue light to come but I don’t think it’s coming. 

Who needs coasts when you’re perfectly adrift?

What’s your favorite scary movie?

I want to be an urban legend. 
I want to be haunted. 

I want to live forever. 

My job. I make people feel pretty. And I make things that; with care, can last forever. 

Oh the lemon tree. The lemons are green still but so and when the pomegranates are out we’ll make pomegranate lemonade and listen to my favorite song; it’s called 


Hopelessly dreamy rainy day vibes with new socks and soft sheets and soft windows and soft sunshine. Wake up to turn out the lights. My fears are soft and so are my knees. These dreams have had their fun with me. 


I make art for a living. Dreamy sad moody nostalgic stuff for dreamy people with bad intentions. 



I want to feel my heart drop through my stomach. I want to feel something good or bad and I want something to write about. Let me turn you into literature and bad paintings. Let’s take Polaroids and hide them in library books. 

Collector of old books and Polaroid photos. Constant reader and dreamer. Following foxes down rabbit holes and making all the worst mistakes. 

I want to believe in ghosts but I’ve never seen proof of one. Someone said your hearts as big as your fist. 

It’s okay if you’re dead inside. 

Let’s be zombies. All braindead and ruled by instinct. 

I want to feel something. Tell me the sky is falling. Tell me the world is ending. 
Tell me something you can say today and never again. 

Come in from the rain and trade your wet socks for something new. 

I’ll read you old poems and tell you all about that time,
The one you dream about

1fxvdkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1fxvdkb/am_i_crazy_or_is_he_subconsciously_manipulating_me/,Am I crazy or Is he subconsciously manipulating me?,"You can read my past posts to catch up, but in nutshell, I've been informed by both my christian therapist and pastor that my mexican husband is emotionally abusive, extremely manipulative, and the best choice is to divorce. 

My husband sees it as him trying to help me be the best I can be, giving me everything I need to be successful. I have examples on previous posts that contradict that. When I told him about it being emotional abuse, he said it's the classic American feminist mentality that my therapist is instilling in me, and there are two sides to the tortilla. He said he's always been here for me and wants nothing but the best for me.

Anyway, yesterday there was another two hour lecture (he expressed his feelings for literally 2 hours..sometimes he'll talk for 4-5 hours straight...I might talk for 1 minute total). Usually it makes me sad and often suicidal. Yesterday during the lecture or monolgue, he mentioned divorce (not him divorcing me but me divorcing him). He told me the fact that my therapist thinks he is mentally abusive is crazy and it traumatized him this past week. He said how he's not going to change because a therapist who doesn't even know him thinks he's in the wrong. He said he doesn't hit me or prohibit me from doing most things, so it's not abuse. He didn't get a reaction out of me at all like he usually does (sad and mad).

So after the conversation, he acted very differently. He acted nice.

When was that last time he invited me out to do something, besides a coffee?Maybe April.

Now suddenly that my parents are coming up for a week, he cares about what I'm doing?

Yesterday he wanted to get coffee with me. The last time he asked me to get a coffee was at least 2 months ago, probably more. 

Today, he knows I have plans with my parents...for at least church and lunch. Now, he asks, ""what are you doing tomorrow in the afternoon? I'm in the mood to play pool. Just you and me.""

Hmmmmm, why now suddenly that my parents are coming up? Plus he already said he's going to go to church and possibly lunch with his friends (his own church with his single, younger, friends who are male and female). Now suddenly he wants to change my brakes (one has been shot for 3 weeks) and cut the grass. He'll say its because he didnt have time and money before, but are we sure? Are you sure it isnt because of my parents? Does he not want them to see how it really is?

Why is he now talking to me more today after the original 2 hour conversation...and subtly complimenting me or saying what i want to hear (our son is really interested in basketball. Maybe we can go to the ymca and you can teach him. I told him im not very good at it, but that you are.""

""This chili is really really good. Make sure you dont give it away when everyone's done. If there's any leftover, i want it.""

Last night at 8pm he said, ""You want to go to Walmart with me? I have to get a couple things."" He rarely ever invites me.
I said no (I always say yes), because:

1) It was getting late and I had to wake up at 5 to prepare myself and kids for church the next morning (he knows that) 
2) I can't go out in looking like a mess . I'd have to take some time to look decent.. because he prohibits me from going out in my crocs, without makeup, etc, while I am with him...because he ""has a reputation to maintain"".
3) He would 3 hours in walmart looking at other, matching outfits, asking my opinion, not caring about the fact that it would be getting late I'd have to wake up the next morning. He knows if I don't go to bed on time, I won't go to church...and if I don't go to church, I won't see my family. 
4) If I show tiredness or boredom while at Walmart, he will get mad. He would tell me, ""We barely ever go out. Enjoy the moment"" or ""This is why I don't go out with you. You always have a face (tired/bored...anyone would)
5)If I were to say, ""Ooh I want to look at this or that while I am here"", he would say, ""You could do that another time. You have all the time in the world. Now we do what I want to do.""

If I would have went yesterday to walmart or today to play pool, ge would have regained control of me.
That's my thoughts since I'm just now learning about it.

He would say its all a coincidence. A month ago, I would have too. But I wonder if there is some subconscious manipulation.

1fxvckc,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommates/comments/1fxvckc/roommate_just_will_not_listen_after_multiple/,"Roommate Just Will Not Listen After Multiple Times Sitting Down and Speaking With Him About His Behavior and Cleanliness, What to do at this point?","Hi All - I'm living in a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment with two roommates (3 total of us. - 2 guys and 1 girl) We each pay around $1000 for our own room which is basically unheard of at this point economy wise.

Jackson (37) has been living in this place for over 11 years and it's rent controlled in a major city with a really great central location to multiple dining, bars, public transit etc.

Violet (32) has been living in the apartment for over 2 years now. 

I Xavier (34) been here a 1 year 3 months.

The entire apartment has pretty much been curated by Jackson over the 11 year span. The couch, coffee table, dining table, chairs, etc. are his and Violet and I don't really have much of our own items in the common living area being the kitchen and living room which is fine but almost feels like we're not roommates but ""living in his apartment"" even though we're all paying an equal share of everything. 

In the past Violet brought up cleaning as she sat us down to let us know, so i decided to start a google calendar of everyone's week to clean (one person cleans once a week the common areas of the living room and kitchen. The first cleaning session went myself, violet, Jackson and when we're talking about cleaning where it's deep and not just taking a wipe and spot cleaning (dusting, taking things off the counter, wiping down all counters, cleaning out the sink, cleaning the microwave etc.) During these deep cleanings Violet and I noticed that that there doesn't seem to be consistency and discussed with each other and noticed Jackson was really cleaning but saying he is. 

Fast forward a few months later Violet brings up the cleaning situation again and says let's sit down and talk about this after she creates a physical paper chart of cleaning. We go over the cleaning duties and she expresses the e-mail she sent saying she feels nobody is listening to her and not cleaning anything. I fully admit to not doing a great job cleaning the microwave and vacuuming the living room but Jackson ""hears her"" but usually tries to change the subject.

  
So last week we cleaned out old pots/pans/etc and talked about cleaning to which Violet already deep cleaned one week previously before we sat down and talked and Jackson claimed he cleaned the week after to which Violet responds ""Well the vacuum job was done really shitty"" Jackson changes the subject and ignores and never addresses what Violet says.

Violet pulled me aside and asked if I cleaned last week to which I said no but Jackson filled out the chart saying he did to which there was stuff in the kitchen on the ground in the corners, and the the counters were dirty. He lied about him cleaning which is highly weird that a 37 year old man is lying about cleaning. Don't get me wrong. I'm not the best at cleaning and not under zero fault at all, but I've always admitted what areas I'm shitty at and have tried to improve and always said ""please let me know if I'm doing something that bothers you and I can fix it"" but I've pretty much given up because of Jackson and how he doesn't even try and decides to lie about it.

I share a bathroom with Jackson and it's never really cleaned, toilet seat is left up, bottom of the white shower is basically black feet marks on the bottom. I started cleaning only MY half of the mirror and side of the sink and Jackson still has not cleaned his side so it gets dirtier and dirtier. When we set down he looked at me and said ""oh i also forget to keep cleaning the bathroom"" I know this isn't my personal hygiene problem because he has a toothbrush holder/razor holder that I've NEVER seen him clean and there's dirt in it.

There always seems to be excuse with Jackson to which is pathetic given he's a 37 year old man. Violet and I have sat down multiple times and tried to be nice about it but it doesn't seem to resonate. 

Other example that proves all of this above and shows he doesn't care

Jackson has left a candle lit and LEFT the apartment I text him and asked him what's the story with that and he said ""leave it lit please"" to which I told him that's very dangerous and I'm going to put it out. A few days later he has it lit again and he's left the house. 

So what on earth can Violet can I do about this? Do we need to basically go hard and have a huge fight because this being understanding is NOT getting through to him at all. Violet and I don't want to move out because a lot of her friends are in the area and it's a good area for my work. Additionally the rent is controlled making both our rents increase probably +1000. We thought about getting a cleaner once a month but getting penalized for him financially doesn't make sense. Would love anyone's advice here on what we can do to solve this situation?

Disclaimer: This is a long one. Like, REAAAAAALLLYYY LONG!!!! (9 google docs pages long). Poor grammar, likely excessive and barely justifiable profanity in this post, so if you're part of the grammar or emotional police, now's the time to dip.

Another Disclaimer: This post is me explaining, in very vivid detail, my seven relationships (all of which will remain anonymous bc I respect them), all of which went to shit because I think I'm just a bad person, but since I don't have many friends who would have valid criticisms or validations, I figured a random online discussion forum would be the next best option to verify my sanity (genius, am I right)?.

Starting off with the basics: I am a heterosexual male with few (male) friends to call my best friends (bc they're very dumb, just like me; will be contradicted in the very next sentence), and I'm pretty smart. I'm not the brightest, but I did manage to keep a 4.0-4.2 GPA during high school, so I hold myself to a high account, but I won't toot my own horn bc im not that kinda person.

On to the complicated bit, I will work from my first relationship to my most recent.

**1st gf**

So my first ever relationship was when I was in the 2nd grade. I met this kinda overweight girl (who we'll name Bella). She wasn't a Gloria from Madagascar, but she was a little chubby, you know, she had them love handles. My naive mind saw straight through her physical appearance, as we spent every second of that class together doing random stuff like homework, watching the movie (Beauty and the Beast I think), and eating pizza together. I saw, as a kid, that people like her are more than just their appearance, which is something that I cannot say for other classmates, but whatever. You get the idea, I chat with her for a long while and at the end of the day we both leave for dismissal and since the two classes never interacted with each other after that day, I didn't see her for the rest of the year.

Next year nothing really happened, we saw each other occasionally. However, during fourth grade, a class project where we put names of people we like on paper leaves and things we like about them on the back, and we stapled those onto a tree in the classroom. The day we were allowed to see what was written about us, I looked at my leaf and I saw the words ""you are cute"" followed by an uncannily perfect shaped heart and a smiley face. It was then that I confronted Bella and she said ""noooooooo, I didn't write thaaaaat,"" said with very obvious sarcasm, followed by a heavy snicker. This may seem like a sweet little thing to many others (bc it is), but when you have NEVER had any girl call you cute except for your grandma or mother, it had a very strong effect on me, and I strived to make her my girlfriend. This goal was only completed in the fifth grade, where after exchanging numbers (i could only WiFi call so technically I didn't have a number but yk), we got home and spent the day playing Minecraft. After a few weeks, I scored a playdate (yes childish ik, but it was serious as a fifth grader to a private school \[the school was private btw I'm too lazy to incorporate it earlier into the story hush\]) and during a weekend day, me and Bella spent a whole 10 hours (8 morning to 6 evening) together just hanging out, and having some serious bonding moments. (she also introduced me to hazbin hotel, just a fun fact) At the end of the day, when I was about to leave, Bella gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I was so God damn happy. Having never been kissed, hugged, hell; even touched, it's safe to say I was pretty fuckin happy to go home that day.

However, the very next day, she called me and added me to a group chat of me, Bella, and a random girl I didn't know the name of (not even now), and she confessed that she was lesbian and was dating said girl for three years. I was shot with distress, emotional damage, and betrayal. In retrospect it was just a kid relationship that should've just stayed friends bc I was probably too young to worry about girls, but it hit me hard man, I lost the only person who ""loved"" me, and I was pissed.

Later in the year, I saw them both coming out of a portable restroom (porta potty for us southerners), and Bella was looking REALLY sweaty and was as red in the face as a tomato. A few seconds later (presumably to discourage suspicion) the other girl came out of the porta potty and she looked me dead in the face and smirked. Eventually me and Bella made eye contact from a few hundred feet away, and she just turned, covering her face with a face that read ""oh shit... uh oh"" which is reasonable because I knew exactly what they were doing. I called her that night, told her that I would be blocking her number, blocked it, and wished her well.               THE END

**2nd GF**

So a little later in life (8th grade to be exact) I was a whole lot more mature (enhanced vocabulary, still the same mobility \[which wasn't a whole lot, I'm not fat, but I'm not fit in the slightest\], and overall improvements to my school performance), BUT it did come at the cost of me getting more and more psychological damage. I would always think of Bella; which fucked me up pretty good, even to those days; be outcasted (a mf named Kole always bullied me to extremes, one time trying to get poison ivy on me for literally no reason other than to torture me. He always spread false rumors about me, whether it be eating rocks, hitting myself for fun, being a racist/sexist/you get the idea, and just picking on me with his gagglefuck of dipshits that he had with him, who always felt the need to bully, harass, haze, and straight up physically assault me) by my peers; and the school was just hard at the time. During the first half of the year, this girl named (again making new name) Ada would always call me play names like ""king"", ""prince"", and other names which now that I think about it were clear signs of hitting on me, but I'm naive so her hints went right over my dumbass head and I never caught on.

That is, until the latter half of the year, where (during the 2 weeks around Valentine's day, the school had a program where you could spend a dollar to send a note, and a few pieces of candy to someone) A ""*secret admirer*"" sent me a cake pop (forgot what its called but its like that) with a note that read ""Will you be the king to my queen?"" (it really read ""will you be my king"" probably but I strongly remember the ""to my"" part, but I'm too stupid to put the pieces together so let's go with ""to my queen"" despite how incorrect it sounds), which made me have a brain blast and look over to the other side of the class, where Ada is staring at me, before she quickly looks away shyly and giggles with her friends. It is then that I realize that for the entire year so far, she has been hitting on me and I never noticed it. A few weeks after that moment, the dance was coming up, so after some very convincing shoulder punches and verbal teasing from some friends, I built up the courage to ask her out to the dance. She said yes, and my heart fluttered with excitement, and I was carried by many ""friends"" on their shoulders to the bathroom where I explained everything, and I was the king of the world for the day. For once, everyone liked me and I got the attention that I wanted so fucking much. It was thrilling, I had never in my life felt like it, like a drug, I enjoyed it while I could.

At the dance, I gave her the (rather expensive but fucking beautiful) corsage I bought her, and she had that anime blush on her face and she was speechless. The world was spinning and I think this is where my insanity kicked in, because when she looked at me, I swear, on my life and dignity, I saw literal hearts in her eyes (and I'm not doing the classic ""she had hearts in her eyes"" like in those anime's, I mean I LITERALLY saw hearts in her fucking eyes, so I think I was mentally not ok). After gathering myself, I took her hand and brought her to the dance floor (the gym floor with a 40-y/o they paid $20 to pretend to DJ while babysitting a hundred or so kids) and I looked her in the eyes and we talked for a good few minutes. After that, we danced together, (during the entire dance btw her face was so damn red I thought she was a tomato, like it was concerning to me) and some slow dance music came on. Ada and I looked at each other before I put my hands on her shoulders, and she put one hand on my hip and one hand on my chest (i had not a fucking inkling of how to dance, so I winged it). This, this right here, sent me, and I felt AWESOME. After the music ends, I could still see the hearts (i think I was fucking hallucinating bc this shit was surreal), and she giggled, hugged me, and went to her friends in the bathroom. After that, I went into the bathroom, and every. single. dude in there was cheering me on, congratulating me, and punching my shoulder enough to make a deeeeeeeep purple bruise when I got home. I got over it though, gathered myself, and got out of the bathroom, only to be met by Ada, who was standing right outside the door (technically around the corner but it took three steps to enter it from where she was) and she took my hand, led me to the center of the dance floor, and we stared at each other. I swear when I tell this next part, all of this is true with ZERO exaggeration. I make eye contact with the DJ and he looks at me, I look at Ada, Ada looks at the DJ, Dj looks at Ada, I look at the DJ, Ada looks at me, I look at Ada, We both look at the DJ, (a lot of turning heads) and this dude gives me a thumbs up with a big smirk and changes songs to a slow dance song again (Perfect by Ed Sheeran).

After that, Ada and I look at each other and we get into position. She puts one hand on my chest and one on my waist. With this next part, there is one thing I need you to understand: I am a fucking moron. In the stressful moment I was overwhelmed, and I put my hands BEHIND MY BACK!!! I blundered the FUCK outta that slow dance, but I kept going with it, dancing with her going back and forth. I had 4 minutes to put at least ONE hand on her shoulder or something and my dumbass kept my hands to myself. I thought that if I put my hands on her hips, I would've crossed a line and I would've had some accusations thrown at me, so I didn't take the risk. But I SHOULD'VE, bc after the dance, I get absolutely demolished with insults by my ""friends"" who said I fucked it up. (in the bathroom btw) After the shaming, I gather the confidence to go apologize to Ada, but after I exit the bathroom, she jumps to me (not literally, just runs to me and embraces me with so much force I almost fell over, and ATT I was abt 6 inches taller than her) and hug me so hard I could barely breathe. I hugged her back, and since it was the end of the dance, (all of the lights were getting shut off \[the blacklights, party lights, and disco ball\] so it was very damn dark) I offered to have our picture taken. She agrees, red-faced in blush STILL (i got over the concern), and we await one of my friends to take the picture. Now, the way the camera worked was that it had the 5/3/1 rule. (where the light turns on for 5 seconds to adjust to the lighting, the light turns off for 3 seconds to prepare the quick flash and capture the picture, and the 1 second \[more like fraction of a second but whatever\] that flashed one more time and captured the picture)

**5**: Ada and I are next to each other, my left hand on her left flank (b/t her ribs and her waist), her right hand on my right shoulder, pulling me close.

**3**: Some shuffling happens and I feel something heavy on my front, and I'm kind of dragged forwards, like i'm gonna fall

**1**: I feel some arms around my neck, pulling me down into a deep french kiss, with a very timid Ada on my front, supporting me as she kisses me.

After the clusterfuck of emotions that I went through, contemplating whether or not I'm a true man, Ada pull me aside and she was crying. Apparently, she was going to a different high school than me, and she had a HUGE crush on me but I was too dumb to see her clear-as-day hints. I tried to talk to her but she ran off, saying sorry while she went away. I tried to make sense of it, but I was so heartbroken and distraught that I could do nothing but just stare as Ada left the premises. I was sad, everyone laughed at me, blaming me for the reason she left, I felt absolutely horrible and eventually I gathered the mindset that it was my fault she left and we couldn't be together.

**3rd gf**

Start of high school, freshman, yk, being an idiot as I always am. I wasn't in the mind for a relationship, and I felt like every girl knew my name and wanted nothing to do with me. That was until this random girl in my third period asked me ""you're single, aren't you?"" In a condescending way, I told her yeah and about my past two experiences with women and she felt so bad, she decided to give me the snapchat (BTW I had NEVER in my LIFE used SnapChat, so yeah that went about as well as you can expect it to) of a girl who we will call Bri(anna). After consoling myself and thanking her, I went home, and sent the first message. ""Hey, is this Bri? The girl sent me this acc so I just wanna make sure."" She said yes, and we small talked about things we liked, disliked, hobbies, colors, styles, basically anything you see in a 1900's romance movie, we talked about. And eventually, she told me to wait by her locker in the next morning, and I did. I waited and waited, and eventually, after many minutes of resisting the urge to check my phone to see if she canceled, she showed up. She was cute, short, slim, and didn't have too long of hair. She immediately hugged me, kinda pushing me against her locker, and I hugged her back. After that, we walk the halls together, we say goodbye, and we go to our separate classes. Nothing really happened after that for a few weeks, BUT I noticed that she was very clingy, so I took a massive risk and asked her out to the homecoming dance, and she said yes. I was confident as a fucking delusional feminist on a podcast, and I waited for Bri at the building on homecoming night. After waiting in the freezing cold for like 20 minutes, she finally shows up in a jeep, and I begin walking towards the vehicle. (i was resting on the building wall, which is abt 200 feet from where she was in the parking lot so it would take a while to walk to her, at least 20-30 seconds). As I'm walking for abt 5 seconds, I see her dad get out of the car, but it's pretty dark (the lights were broken except for one on the wall of the building so I couldnt see anything at all), and I think to myself ""huh, her dad is kinda short... eh, i've seen shorter so its not that bad."" Then I see her dad open the door for her to get out. ""Well I mean dads do that, maybe he just wants his little girl to feel spe-"" and as I think that, Bri and this man have an intense make-out session. This wasn't Bri's father, it was her fucking boyfriend. After they finish doing the deed, she notices me staring and from across the parking lot, I see her make an ""oh- fuck.."" face. Her bf notices this, and looks in my direction, and sees a weak mf holding his phone close to his head (me btw) and assumes that he's recording them taking a video. In reality, I was telling my mom to come pick me up, but tell that to a man walking with power towards you while his gf is trying to stop him. With many things going through my mind, I simply stay next to the wall in the dark, waiting for him to come into talking range, but as I begin conversation, he quickly grabs me by the front of my shirt (like a bully would ask someone for lunch money) with one hand and shoves me against the brick wall with all his might. It hurt like a MOTHERFUCKER but I took it like a champ and asked him what he wanted. He then said ""You're talking to my girl!?"" All the while Bri is trying to talk him out of beating my ass. I try to explain the situation, but I see the silhouette of him reaching in his pocket and pulls something out, and I hear a *""click.""* Whether or not it was the click of a sidearm, a switchblade, or his bare fucking knuckles, I wasn't about to be brave, so I put my hands up (his hand is still on my collar) because I don't want to fucking die. After many pant-shitting moments, I say ""listen dude, I asked her out, I didn't know she had a boyfriend, I'm sorry dude. I bought her ticket for her, you want it?"" I pull it out, give it to him, and he takes it, and a kind of crying Bri and her bf walk into the building with Me and Bri's tickets. I saw them enter, and I just sat down on the edge of the building and managed to hold back tears (I literally refused to cry) and an hour later, my mother showed up, and we went home. I never told anyone about it until now, but I'm sure Bri told people.

After confronting her at school a few days later, she said ""I'm so sorry... I forgot I had a bf when you had asked me so I just said yes."" I trusted her, so I walked away, and we never talked since.

**4th gf**

My 3rd gf was during the first half of the year, this one is the latter half of the year, where me and my gagglefuck of dumb friends (me, the short one Braidon, the tall gay one Mason, and the dumbass Jaden) overheard some girls making overtly masculine and funny jokes (not to say women cant be funny, not starting that shit. I mean they were making very ""group chat at 3am"" type of shit like dick, nazi, hitler, racist, sexist \[in favor of masculinity\] jokes and shit) and we immediately got closer to hear. Once we heard a funny joke, we all laughed our asses off, which caught the attention of the girls. We got closer and introduced ourselves, and they did the same. The main girl was Nikki, and the others I forgot their names, but me and Nikki made a pretty good duo. We always finished each others' (sentences) *\[see what I did there? Eh?\]*. Anyways, one of her friends dared her to ask me for my number, so I gave it to her. She said to call later, so when I got home, we called. We talked for hours on end. But... she wasn't the same as she was at school. She was fucking depressing. Always complaining about her family and how nobody loved her. I said that I loved her, and she just laughed and said goodnight. I felt like shit for a bit, but I shrugged it off.

A month goes by and she DOES NOT STOP CALLING ME. Every day, every hour, she always called me. in the middle of the night, every day. It was getting to the point where I went sleepless for some nights, and I have to explain to her that I can't call her because I'm mowing my lawn. She believes that this is just ""another excuse"" and says that if I don't get my shit together and call her she'll leave me. So I tell her to wait for an hour, I'll finish cutting my grass, and call her. She says fine, and that's what I do. It is very late, and I call her, and she doesn't say a fucking word. She just stares off to the side of the camera, like she's looking at something. After a few minutes she grabs something metal and a long sleeve shirt. She leaves the room, and 5 mins later she comes back, shirt on, hands behind her back, but she was crying, and I could see what she did to herself. She was harming herself, and then she hung up on me. She never went to school after that night, and went radio silent for a few weeks. During this period, her friends at school started to harass me and call me a monster. I couldn't help but think of the obvious, and I knew that it was all my fault. She said that if I left her she would... yk. I felt horrible, responsible, and guilty. I went several nights just staring at my ceiling. Eventually, one night at like 11:00/12:00, I woke up to a call from Nikki. She said nothing, but I could hear crying, excessively. I kept trying to talk to her, but she just kept crying for like five minutes. After which, she just said ""i'm... sorry..."" and she hung up, never called back, and didn't answer my texts. Eventually \*TRIGGER WARNING FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE SENSITIVE\* I walk into the bathroom of my house. I look into the mirror and stare for a good minute or so. After a while, my emotions started to get to me. Terror, guilt, anger, sadness, anxiety, everything was piling up, and I got fucking terrified. So scared, that in the mirror, I no longer saw myself. \*TRIGGER SPOT\* I saw Nikki. A naked, bloodied, mangled, cut, and bruised Nikki. I saw a long and deep gash along her wrist. I started to bleed from my eyes, so I grabbed some paper towels and wiped them profusely, but it wasn't blood. It was just tears, and after looking back in the mirror, I noticed that everything was normal. I was in the mirror, crying. After that, I started to laugh uncontrollably, whilst tears are shooting out of my eyes, rolling down my cheeks, and I couldn't stop crying and laughing. Something just took control of me and I laugh-cried for like 10 minutes straight. My eyes were dry as fuck, my throat was aching, and everything hurt. Then nothing hurt, and I stared in the mirror. Drenched in sweat, tears, and insanity, the front of my shirt covered, and the sink wet; I walked back into my room. I sat on my bed, thought about it for a second, then went to sleep.

I don't know what it was, maybe I was just tired, but I swear everything that was stated is true. I saw that shit, and I can never forget it. The end.

**5th gf**

So this one is way less gruesome, but still hurts me. It was during my sophomore year of high school. I was in the FBLA club, and we were going to the regionals. After doing the standardized tests to qualify for state, a dude walks up to me and asks me for my snapchat, claiming that a girl (pointed to a *big* girl who looked pretty) wanted my snap, but was too shy to ask herself. I agreed, giving him my snapchat and my number, but after a minute, the girl walked up shyly and said that the snapchat didn't work, so she scanned my snap, and we talked on there for a good hour or so, just talking about nothings. Then, we talk about relationships, and she says she'd like to get to know me better by meeting after the FBLA conference was over. I agreed, and we talked about where we could meet, but we never decided on a place and we never met after that day. A few weeks go by and we slowly stop talking to each other on snapchat. A few months after that, I send her a THESIS of a message, basically saying that I'm dumb, not in the mind for a relationship, and that since we never truly said goodbye, it haunts me that it's my fault for the failed chance at love. She never responded (well she did but not relevant now, BUT IT IS for my 7th GF, so wait for that one) so never got closure for it, which fucking destroyed me. It was a short and sweet relationship that didn't last that long, hell, some would say that we weren't even bf and gf, but in my eyes, it felt like it... while it lasted.

**6th** **gf**

This one is a doozy, but isn't a whole essay like the previous ones. She wasn't a girlfriend, but rather someone who I ALMOST asked out to a date.

So Braidon, his dad, and I were all going to the mall to shop for a party, and we ran into the Starbucks mini store, and we figured well fuck it. Why not right? So we go into it, and we immediately see a girl sitting by herself watching the television on the wall, and we STOP. She's pretty decent, is decently endowed in the front and back, and my friend and his father immediately say, ""dude, you gotta ask her out"". After trying to dissent my friend and his father's shenanigans, I acquiesce and walk up to the girl, all while under the guise of a confident teenager. I ask her if she's alone and she says that she's waiting for her mother to come get her, as her friends had rides after shopping, but she didn't. I sat down next to her and asked her if I could buy her a coffee to cheer her up. She declined at first, but she accepted on the second ask, trying to be polite (from what I infer). I got her something with caramel, coffee, and milk (cappuccino macchiato deluxe or some shit with a fake fancy name), and after apologizing to my wallet, I give it to her. She thanks me and takes a large sip (abt 1/10 of the drink). I ask her ""so... heh, what's going on in your world?"" She explains why she's there and as I'm about to ask her for her name, she says ""Mmh, something doesn't taste right... what's in this drink?"" I ask her if she's fine and say that it was a smth smth deluxe smth, and she immediately says ""a what!?"" and as she says that, we both hear a very loud gargle/grumble, presumably from her stomach, to which I figure something out and ask, ""Are you lactose intolerant or something?"" To which my question is immediately answered, because she hauled absolute ASS to the restroom. I heard a lot of groaning, followed by some (what I assume is) bowel movements. I thought that people who were lactose intolerant took a few minutes to have intense shits when drinking milk, but I guess I was corrected. (maybe she was allergic? idfk, I'm not a biologist) I tell the barista what happened, and while berating me for not asking for allergies before ordering, I assume she got some workers to aid her, as me, Braidon, and his dad got the fuck outta there. (btw they watched everything from a table across the room, and still laugh about it to this day)

Still can't help but feel responsible for that one as well. (which is fair since I didn't ask)

**7th gf (where the manipulation kind of kicks in)**

This is my most recent, and frankly, the most important relationship I have ever had. At the end of my sophomore year (literally the last day of school on a Thursday) this girl, we'll call her Madi(son), asked me for my number. Now, me and Madi had known each other for a while, she and her friend would always ask me for money for the vending machines (when they fucking worked) and she was good with her money, usually paying me back within a week. But I always felt an attraction to her. She's a big gal, and Imma say it, she was big boned. But she was... endowed, and frankly, she had a nice personality.

About 2 months go by and we are literally Bonnie and Clyde. Always by my side, clinging to me, fending off any woman who came too close to me. I paid no mind to it, and we loved each other for another 2 months. A few weeks after we went on our first ""official"" date, I asked her to the homecoming dance and game. She accepted both. (she also had recently ATT taken my v-bucks card \[iykyk\] so...............) I kept asking her what she was gonna wear, but she just kept saying that she was ugly and self deprecating. I always complimented her to boost her emotions, and she clung to me every time I did it. This process kept on for a few weeks. My 5th gf (there she is) contacted me after so long and said ""hey, sorry I didn't contact you, it was rude and I hope we can still be friends, or try again?"" With my love only for Madi now, I told her ""sorry, I have a girlfriend now. I found someone who loves me, and I'm doing great. I wish you luck, and my girlfriend doesn't like me texting other women. Goodbye, good luck, yours truly."" (yes, Madi absolutely HATED if I ever texted any female, and I'm pretty sure that should've been the first red flag, but I was hooked. Eventually, she pulled me outta fifth period and told me ""I... I think we should take a break. I'm going through a lot of stuff right now, and I need some time to myself."" OBVIOUSLY I agreed, respecting her boundaries and giving her time to herself, but I sent texts and snaps to her every morning and evening to make sure she was ok. The day before homecoming, my friends told me to check our school's daily youtube video (pretty much the MOTD of the school in a youtube video along with other news). I checked it, and I saw my girlfriend and her new boyfriend both holding a hoco poster that said ""would you go with anyone but me?"" She said no, she wouldn't go with anyone but him. Using the ticket I bought her, she went to homecoming with him, and I went to the dance. I saw her at the dance, grinding her front and back against her new bf, clinging to him like a nymphomaniac, but I never made eye contact. I sat in the corner, and some girl sat next to me and put her hand on my shoulder. I barely knew her name, but she asked if I wanted a hug. I said yeah. She opened her arms, and I reluctantly wrapped my arms around her back. I put my head on her shoulder, burying my face away from her face, embarrassed, and letting stress get to my head... I cried. I cried my heart out. No words, just hell let loose on her shoulder. She pat my head and finally, after like 5 mins of crying... I let go. I got off of her, apologized, and walked away to talk to some of my friends (braidon and the dipshits). I had asked them if they knew who the girl was, but they said ""what girl, dumbass? You know damn well no girl approached you."" While laughing, they walked off, but I was just stuck there in time. Who was the girl? Was she real? Am I insane? (yes) But eventually I gathered myself emotionally, and moved on and enjoyed the dance. I cheered for the nominated queen and king court of the homecoming dance, and I moved on. While I was walking out of the building, I saw Madi talking to her bf and she looked like she was crying. (they are still together, she just gets emotional, I would know, she did it all the time when she was with me) She looked my way and smirked, and I just flipped her off and went to my father's truck. He asked me what was wrong, and I said ""I moved on."" And he just nodded and drove us home, where I ate pizza.

I don't wanna accuse Madi of manipulating me, but aaaallllllll her friends are saying that she did it to make me jealous. (which is where the manipulation in this post mainly relies) I almost let it get to me, but I didn't. I still think of her often, but instead I hope she finds someone who loves her for who she truly is. A two-faced backstabbing manipulative cold-hearted whore. She had four boyfriends before me, and she took the virginity of all of them. Good luck.

I just wanna know if my viewpoints are justified. I need to know if any of these relationships failed outside of my control, or if every single one was due to my own ignorance and I'm just delusional. If you have any advice, I'd love to hear it.

1fxvbf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1fxvbf4/after_almost_a_year_of_sobriety_i_chose_to_drink/,"After almost a year of sobriety, I chose to drink this weekend. ","To make a long story short, I’ve been thinking of having a drink recently, and this Saturday I had  5 high noons and a glass of Bourbon at an annual Fall party. I planned this and the night was great. We all had a blast, husband and kids included. 

4am on the dot, I woke up with that crippling anxiety that I have not felt in nearly a year. I could not fall back asleep. Heart racing, worried about the morning to come, heavy restless arms and legs, thirsty and just generally unwell. I had to go to the car, outside in the driveway as I knew there was one high noon left in the cooler. I drank it, in the dark, at 4am. Went back to bed. 

Surprisingly I woke up without a hangover, but not my normal energy. Coffee tasted terrible and I didn’t feel like showering. But I had a busy day ahead..

My daughter and her soccer team were walking out with our city’s MLS team followed by the game. Super cool. At the Stadium, I felt like crap as the sun started beating down, and what did I do? I grabbed a beer. And then 2 more. All of the parents were, why can’t I? The game and cool experience for my daughter turned into me waiting in line for beer. 

Thats all I had earlier, but it took all of my strength to not stop on the way home. 

Lessons learned-

One night turns into a string of days too easily

The anxiety is NOT worth it. 

The party was not anymore fun than it would have been, and I would have been more present at each event if I was sober. ",4,1728261546.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False

After telling myself I would no longer tolerate this shit and let my daughters grow up seeing this, I went to centrelink to see if I could get any help, started to look at houses and told him I wanted a seperation. 
All of a sudden now he's capable of talking healthily ( suspect narc, was stonewalling), he's said he's willing to get an accountability app, he's showing all this praise. Taking my ups and downs, tell me I have every right to feel this way. Even has went as far as saying he can see why I would want to separate, even though that hurts him. He said he knows I'm not mucking around that this isn't just a verbal line in the sand and that I will leave.
The thing is, since he has apparently not been watching porn or thirst traps, he's been my shadow. I'm talking about making me coffees, seeking me out, even if I'm just hanging out the washing he's by my side 2 mins later. He's been not taking his phone to the bathroom as recommended, and even came in to give me his phone when I was putting the baby down for a nap so he wouldn't be alone with it. He's been telling me about his urges, and although I feel slightly ashamed about this, I let him watch me shower and he masturbated over me, as he said he was really in the mood but I wasn't. 
Is this fake recovery? 
My brain is saying this is love bombing, this is apart of our toxic cycle. However I'm just kinda letting it happen atm because well it feels nice for my heart, and the house feels at peace. But I keep making myself aware of it, but also indulging it ?

It's a long story but l'm really desperate for some help. My father died 20years in the navy.
My mother did the exact worse thing you'd expect and it's toss the will (witnessed it). He had a DNR. WEVE TALKED ABOUT IT. And I wasn't even informed he was in the hospital my son told me a couple months later. He was worried because he was being put on life-support over and over and over again torture I found out I called through a fit, and it wasn't long after that he actually died his heart was spaghetti. Five heart attacks and over 30 strokes finally took him out she Cremated him immediately and tossed him on the coffee table next to the coasters. No funeral. No obituary.
Nothing. ""Cost too much"". Sold his entire legacy within a week for CCbills. I'm desperate to get him buried like he planned. Dumped me off in Kentucky refusing me the car in my name. That aside; it goes way deeper but that's not why l'm here. And I'm not here for any loot. I'm here cuz I think I found something. Some kind of stuff in a file I have found. And it's so weird the things I'm finding and I'm just at a stand still. I feel so crazy. Do people do this? Hide things, assets; info to plan for the worst (which tbh was). I just need to find something that allows me to push and get rights to have him buried. I'm alone. His family is no help or anywhere to be found. I just need someone to talk to, bounce thoughts off of, or to tell me I am really that crazy to think so.

I will try to keep it short and to the point. To fill you in on both him and I... Husband works 2 jobs. He works his 8 hour great job, then does umpiring on the weekends which probably is another 8 hours of a day from the time he leaves home to the time he gets back home. So he works his jobs 7 days a week, 8 hours every day.. and makes very good money. I'm a stay at home mom to 3. I am a homeschool mom. My kids are always with me, besides when I work 3 nights a week doing a 12 hour shift to have extra money to not have to ask him for money for soap, shampoo, paper towels, toilet paper, new socks for the kids, new puzzles for the kids, home decorations, etc.... I don't have to pay a bill, although I contribute to groceries so he doesn't have to buy them. Just like he doesn't have to wash his laundry, make his dinner, worry if we have coffee in the jar for the morning, clean a bathroom, call the doctor for the kids, or worry about the little things. I feel like those things are a part of my ""work"" staying home with my kids while he's at work to provide our financial security. And I do it proudly and gladly and happily. It's a hard job, but I wouldn't want any other set of responsibilities outside of what I do, truly genuinely and honestly. I'm happy. I'm overloaded, but I'm happy. I actually get anxiety if there's nothing for me to do, I feel purposeless. I do what I do for him and my kids and it feels every day like I'm fulfilling my purpose in this life. My 12 hour shifts a few days a week are taking care of elderly. So I change diapers at home and then go to work and change more. But I wouldn't want to work 12 hours at Amazon. I like taking care of other people, it's evident. Now..... I can't say that my husband likes working two jobs. He loves his primary job, but he doesn't wish to umpire. He does it because it's great money, and it's his favorite sport. But I know for a fact he would rather not have to umpire...... So hopefully this gives an idea of what he and I do on a daily basis. 
Now, here's the problem that I'm having.... maybe my husband is just letting life take him with the wind in a sense where he is not necessarily on some sort of adventure, but rather just flowing with ""normal daily living""... 7 days a week after he gets out of whichever job, he comes home sits down and grabs his guitar, after he eats the dinner I cooked for him and then rinses only his plate and puts it in the dishwasher. After maybe 20 minutes, he'll sit down on the couch with the kids and put the tv on for them and kick his feet up while I'm cleaning the kitchen after dinner. Then when they fall asleep, he goes on his video games and drinks a beer. And this is our daily life, except when I work overnights (then he drinks 6 beers because I'm not there to say anything about it). And also except... the night he wants my goodies. My husband can be cuddly, sweet, thoughtful, talkative, gentle, romantic... only on the nights he wants to have sex. He says he wants to ""spend time"", but that's not what it is.... at all. He just wants sex from me. After he gets it, the next night he goes back to playing golf on his Xbox with his brother and drinking a cold one. He has done this for years... I mean years. Spending time is sex. That's all it is. And can I just say...... I feel like it's been even more so now that I'm pregnant again with another responsibility he didn't want, but I always DREAMED for. I've always wanted 4 kids. I'm happy and grateful beyond words can describe. How did I get pregnant by a person so firm on not having any more children? Well, I had to beg that for my birthday the cards would be in my favor and I could at least see if my dream could come true of being a mom of 4. (Thank you God). And you wanna know what his words were to me? ""You got what you wanted and you're pregnant so now all I ask is that you leave me alone"". He was basically implying that I never have an opinion about why he plays video games so much instead of spending real quality time with me, or picks up the guitar first thing when he gets home every day after he hasn't seen his kids all day, or why he drinks so often. 
You know, I accept that my husband and I are incredibly different. I think deeply. I'm very sensitive to love and hurt. I am a Christian girl who loves Jesus with all her heart. I've never drank in my life. I don't smoke. I don't leave my kids to party with a bunch of girls. I don't waste my time with gossip or watch reality tv, it's just distasteful in my opinion. I love to read, only nonfiction that are about Christianity or parenting. I never have time to do anything so when I get time I like to use it to better myself in any way I can. I'm selective on what I listen to for music. I'm selective about my friends, which is why I have maybe 2. I just try to have values and I'm careful about what I consume in my soul. And maybe you read that and for a split second tried to put a face to this boring girl. But without sounding arrogant, conceited, whatever you want to call it... just picture Selena Gomez a few years ago. Spanish, slim, curly hair (me). A beautiful strong girl! 
He.... is the opposite of every single thing I just said. The only reason we are together is because he wasn't this person when we met 10 years ago. He just has changed so much...
I'm just annoyed by the fact that it doesn't feel like I have a husband, a best friend. He is just doing life with me. And we do it well. But he's in his own world, and just comes over to mine when he wants sex. 
And now I'm a pregnant, stay at home mom of 3, homeschooler and overnight caretaker with a husband who pays the bills and uses me for sex.

# Lead generation is hard.

In today's highly competitive business landscape, generating leads is no longer just about casting a wide net and hoping for the best.

The digital age has transformed how customers find, interact with, and ultimately choose the businesses they trust.

Traditional methods, such as cold calling and direct advertising, have become less effective as consumers gain access to more information and resources to make informed decisions.

Sales Lead introduces the concept of inbound leads—prospects who find your business through channels like referrals, organic content, and industry engagement.

Our inbound strategies turn your business into a lead magnet, attracting qualified prospects who are already interested in what you offer.

The best part? You're not just growing your business - you're strengthening your entire industry ecosystem. It's growth with a purpose.

This is your chance to change your business. To build a lead generation strategy that doesn't live and die by the whims of a social media algorithm. To create partnerships that last and leads that convert.

Remember, in business, the right connection can change everything.

# How It Works (And Why It's Awesome)

Here's the deal:

1. We give you these golden lists of associations with your ideal clients
2. You reach out and form partnerships. (Don't worry, we'll provide you a script!)
3. These groups become your affiliates, sending qualified leads your way.

It's beautiful in its simplicity, isn't it?

 

# Why This Matters (Like, Really Matters)

Let's talk about why this is more than just a business strategy:

1. **You're Supporting The Industry You Serve:** Instead of lining the pockets of tech giants, you're putting money back into the associations that support your field. It's like watering the roots instead of just buying new flowers.
2. **You're Building Real Relationships:** In a world of chatbots and AI, you're connecting with real humans. Revolutionary, right?
3. **You're Reducing Risk:** Remember that company that lost everything overnight? With our approach, you're not at the mercy of a single platform or algorithm. Ever heard the expression don't put all your eggs in one basket?
4. **You're Being Smart with Money:** In today's economy, every dollar counts. Why spend on ads that might work when you can invest in partnerships where you only pay if they work? Make your CFO happy, with a guaranteed ROI. With referrals you only pay if they convert. Why wouldn't you take a bet with asymmetric upside?

We're not here to sell you a list and disappear. We're in this with you. That's why we also provide:

* Guidance on how to set these up tracking codes (because we know tech can be tricky) through our affiliate tracking guide.
* Give you kick ass templates for cold outreach (writer's block be gone!)
* Plus some bonus data set freebies; the social media forums where your customers are hanging out anyway!

I've seen firsthand how the right partnership can transform a business. I've also seen how the wrong marketing strategy can sink one. That's why I'm so passionate about what we do at Sales Lead.  

We're not just helping businesses find leads. We're helping them build lasting relationships, establish credibility, and grow sustainably.

**About**

Hello, I'm Kate.

Welcome to the story of Sales Lead – a tale of frustration in the pursuit of a better way to do business.

Picture this: A young finance professional, fresh-faced and eager, stepping into the world of corporate finance. That was me, not too long ago. I had it all – a lucrative job, a corner office (okay, it was more of a cubicle with a slightly better view), and the promise of a comfortable future.

But something wasn't right.

As I climbed the corporate ladder, I saw things that didn't sit well with me. I watched talented sales teams struggle, not because they weren't good at their jobs, but because they were fighting an uphill battle. The leads they were getting? Low volume, low quality. It was like trying to build a sandcastle with a teaspoon.

And the marketing teams? Oh boy. I saw them pour millions – yes, millions – into social media advertising. The result? A constant game of catch-up, always one algorithm change away from disaster. They were on a hamster wheel.

One day, it all came crashing down. A company I worked closely with lost everything overnight. Facebook changed its algorithm, and suddenly, their entire business model was obsolete. People lost their jobs. Families were affected. Dreams were shattered.

I couldn't sleep that night. Or the next. I kept thinking, ""There has to be a better way.""

It hit me during a late-night coffee run (let's be honest, it was more like my fifth energy drink). What if we could go back to basics? What if we could connect businesses directly with the communities they serve?

I remembered the power of partnerships I'd seen in my finance role. How the right connection could skyrocket a business overnight. It wasn't rocket science – it was relationship building.

The harsh reality is:

* You pay whether the ads work or not.
* One small change in their algorithm can tank your business overnight.
* With AI-generated content flooding the internet, it's harder than ever to stand out.

So, I did something crazy. I quit my job. Yes, that cushy, well-paying corporate gig. My mom thought I'd lost it. Maybe I had. But I knew I had to try.

That's how Sales Lead was born.

At Sales Lead, we're not reinventing the wheel. We're just reminding people how powerful that wheel can be when used correctly. We provide businesses with

But we're not just a data provider. We're matchmakers in the business world.

**How It Works (And Why It's Awesome)**

Here's the deal:

1. We give you these golden lists of associations with your ideal clients
2. You reach out and form partnerships. (Don't worry, we'll provide you a script!)
3. These groups become your affiliates, sending qualified leads your way.
4. You only pay when you get actual business from these associations because you are setting up a partnership (great, huh?).

It's beautiful in its simplicity, isn't it?

**Why This Matters (Like, Really Matters)**

Let's talk about why this is more than just a business strategy:

1. **You're Supporting The Industry You Serve:** Instead of lining the pockets of tech giants, you're putting money back into the associations that support your field. It's like watering the roots instead of just buying new flowers.
2. **You're Building Real Relationships:** In a world of chatbots and AI, you're connecting with real humans. Revolutionary, right?
3. **You're Reducing Risk:** Remember that company that lost everything overnight? With our approach, you're not at the mercy of a single platform or algorithm. Ever heard the expression don't put all your eggs in one basket?
4. **You're Being Smart with Money:** In today's economy, every dollar counts. Why spend on ads that might work when you can invest in partnerships where you only pay if they work? Make your CFO happy, with a guaranteed ROI. With referrals you only pay if they convert. Why wouldn't you take a bet with asymmetric upside?

We're not here to sell you a list and disappear. We're in this with you. That's why we also provide:

* Guidance on how to set these up tracking codes (because we know tech can be tricky) through our affiliate tracking guide.
* Give you kick ass templates for cold outreach (writer's block be gone!)
* Plus some bonus data set freebies; the social media forums where your customers are hanging out anyway!

I've seen firsthand how the right partnership can transform a business. I've also seen how the wrong marketing strategy can sink one. That's why I'm so passionate about what we do at Sales Lead.  

We're not just helping businesses find leads. We're helping them build lasting relationships, establish credibility, and grow sustainably.

1fxv0to,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1fxv0to/need_advicesfeedback/,Need Advices/Feedback,"Hello Everyone, i am a 26 Yo male non-Filipino and not Western and i dated a 25 yo cute Filipina, at first we were friends, both of us are international students in college, i used to find her with my other Filipina friend when they switched us the previous semester.

we slowly became friends, and then we got closer and closer until a bond was forged before we entered the relationship we set standards and we talked about lots of future subjects, like values, religion, and finances, and we agreed on them, what got me attracted to her was her personality and her intelligence and physically she was tiny and adorable.

she used to tell me i date to marry, she used to be in a 6 years relationship that ended before she came to a new country and my last relationship was in 2018 , we agreed that this is not a rebound relationship or wasting our time, we are here for the future since we are both building our life and we have shared goal.

we spent 8 months together, and lots of very good memories, I know how happy and comfy i made her feel, and the same for her to me, yeah we have disagreements here and there like any other couple out there and we know we are not perfect and we acknowledged that this relationship we will be challenging because we are not from the same culture however as long as we are together we can find solutions.

She lives here with her aunt , and this aunt at first wasn't accepting of me , (the aunt never saw me or even talked me , she just judged based on my religion and ethnicity) she used to tell her go marry a canadian citizen however, my gf used to tell me that she spends lots of time and effort to paint me in a good image to her aunt.

and she used to tell me that her aunt gave her so much stress and hard time, especially taking care of her aunt's kids, that can be hard to manage as an international student in a foreign country.

days and months passed by , we had our highs and lows as any normal relationship but we always bounce back and our love never diminished.

even when i returned back home and we switched to LDR for 2 months our love stayed strong even though we had a small quarrels at that time but we always pushed through.

on September 24th 2024, on my other friend's birthday , we were in college going together to get those plastic forks and spoons , we passed by 2 other Filipinos that we don't like and they don't like us (especially me), one of them is a female that used to spread bad rumors about me to my gf aunt and since my gf is scared of her aunt that made things complicated, so when i saw my gf waving hi at them, as a reflex i slightly pushed her on the back as a le'ts go hurry, I intended no harm whatsoever. she trumbled a bit and said to me ""why did you push me infront of them?"" i said don't worry about it let's go our friend is waiting.

we took pictures with our friend and when we are going home together she started talking about how that slight push because it was infront them , they will go report it to her aunt and all her efforts of building my image will go to vain and she started crying because she thought i don't understand and it escalated i try to de-escalate by telling her they won't report it , it was a slight push and she was more enraged , we reached home we argued for abit and then i left her to go cooldown a bit and then comeback (bear in mind that i was dealing with some other personal stuff from other sides aswell) when i came back after few minutes i found her packing her clothes and stuff and i told her , are you going to keep doing this whenever we had arguments ? then she booked an uber and i was so tired and drained, i wished her a happy life in the heat of the moments when we were fighting, then she left in the uber, then couple of hours later i sent her a text message on messenger apologizing and such , she said she forgives me and that she wants peace now and then she removed the chat colors and removed the nicknames, and i asked why she said because she is serious, i left here be for couple of hours then i texted her if there is any possibility for her to come back and talk ? she spoke in slogans and said No that boat has sailed..

and since that i tried to reconcile and talk to her more and no text worked she was talking about how she tried and how i deserve someone better and that i am not happy with her and such and that she can only offer friendship and dramatic talks that is not true, then i met her after the incident face to face to further try and reconcile with her and tell her we passed by bumps before this is a small bump in our future and we are here for the long run and she started crying again and her aunt again was brought up and this time magically her aunt became nice and caring..we spoke for 3 hours i was trying to reconcile and we didn't reach anywhere she says she forgives me but she can't forget, as if i did this unforgivable catastrophic sin.. before she left for work she said if you want to be friends let me know your decision..

after that, i tried again and again to reconcile and Monday morning she said , she will considerate but i needed to give her time , so i let her be and on that night of that monday she texted me on how we cannot make it and we are not compatible and she brought up stuff that we already discussed and agreed on since we met as if she doesn't know me for 8 months and lots of dramatic texts not logical at all. so and this is my bad i panicked and i started begging and pleading and calling her and i lost control of my emotions , she picked up and my crying voice i tried reconciling again telling her we have been through bad and sour and good together , as long as we are together we can tackle everything , she brought up her aunt again and how difficult the relationship and she was saying stuff that doesn't make any sense, i tried to reason with her and use logical approach to paint the bigger picture and finally she agreed on trying again and she told me now i need to do damage control because she thinks my image is tarnished for her aunt (which i don't understand if this is a philipino thing where aunts are hold in higher regards or what, she is not even her mom, i always tell her i only care about your mom and siblings) , she cares about my image and other people opinions and her aunt sayings.

then she sent me a text about this is your second chance and whatnot don't fk up or i won't offer friendship and i will block and forget. (as if it is easy to forget all those good memories and how happy she was with me) i told her don't sacrifice me and our relationship for other people's opinions we are building ourselves here step by step.

a couple of days after that she returned to not agreeing and on Thursday i tried offering her her favorite coffee on our lunch break, french vanilla with quarter-coffee as usual one for me and for her, she texted something weird like as a concerned friend yes but as a bf no, like wtf does that mean ?? , you just said couple of days ago you are okay with us together and she even called me babe and she said something like , if your brought me a gift or food this will end sooner (the drama i suppose) , i was acting on her words, and before that night i was crafting a surprise gift for her a bracelet with her faviorite color that says ""Always believe my special and the word Mahal"" , on Thursday October 3rd 2024 , in the lunch break it was akward moments she kept hitting my legs under the table gentley i didn't know what she wanted or mean and before that i told her you want to go get coffee i will buy , she said no with face, then i asked if we can go talk outside, she was walking slowly behind me and then the shocker she stood like 4 to 5 meters across of me , i told her why are you far way get close so we can hear eachother, the moment i started approaching her she started going backwards, as if i am a monster or godzilla , i didn't know what she did that..the conversation started okay and good , she was still not making any sense and saying drama things and how what i did shocked her and made her terrified and how her neck twisted and etc , which btw not true because no neck was twisted and she was perfectly fine , proof is we took pictures after that , her only concern was not the slight push but because infront of ""them"" and she herself said if as a friend you pushed me , i will push you back. so the push is not the cause issue.

then she started with non-chalant and i was nervious and reasoning and she was on another personality as if the girl i knew for 8 months is not there and it is another personality filled with stuff that doesn't make sense, then she started accusing me of having a temper and said in hindsight i knew , as if she tool time to really think of everything from a logical pov not emotional dramatic one.

then i got angry and she got angry and she started personal attacks, we said bad stuff to each other and the convo went to shit and after she blocked me on Messenger, unfollowed me on insta but left my number unblocked.

I just want to know if all of this is justified, am i a a monster ? , what about the overall good relationship we had for 8 months, what about what i made her feel the good? will she come back and realize that she was not thinking straight?

I want Filipino advice for guys and girls because i ran scenarios in my head and not one of them gave a valid logical reason for her to break up like this nor all of this to happen.

Thank you for reading all of that, it is very hard on me because i remember all the good times and i will add that she is not an evil vile person, in the contrary she is one of the sweetest person i have ever been with, it is not fair to let this relationship go to waste because of hormones or unlogical reasons.

No matter what you choose, you’re going to be blown to smithereens.

As I’ve previously stated, I’m divorced. A long time after the separation… like a year-ish, I decided to give online dating a try. That… was a mistake. All I learned is that I’m every bit as repulsive and disposable as my ex told me I was. 

I tried multiple platforms. Tinder, Hinge, Facebook Dating, Plenty Of Fish, etc… all to no avail. Literally hundreds of dollars spent on “membership” fees, innumerable hours spent tweaking and consulting the input of friends and family on the tweaking of my profile, a bazillion likes, swipes, super likes, thoughtfully considered messages… all that for a single lowsy coffee date with a sterile woman who ghosted me after complaining because I said I wanted to text her good morning and would that be alright. Spoiler: it was not alright by her. [Bitch]. 

I felt, and still do, that there must be something wrong with me. Why else would thousands, if not tens of thousands of women ignore me with such contempt. I got a few “real” likes, to be fair. Of the real likes I did get, they were from beached whales. Like, holy moly, what the actual fuck. I’m not fat. I’m a bit pudgy, but I’m not needing a freight scale to check my digits on the daily.. far from it. These formally-sea faring creatures actually thought I might be interested. And that right there, that tells me everything I don’t want to know about myself. I’m not fat, but I’m so horribly unattractive that nobody besides Gidzillas fucking cousins want to butter my bread. 

Holy cow. No pun intended. None of the halfway decent looking chicks on the platform were even remotely interested in me. Many probably gave up a long time ago. Some likely are exactly as I said… wholly uninterested. 

The point is, I know I’m closer to Steve Buscemi than Matthew McConaughey… but stop. I’ve got value besides my looks… I swear it!

Bwahaha… I guess women really are as shallow as they accuse men of being. Meanwhile, as the stupidity of society has accepted online dating as the go to media for reconnoiter and rendezvous… where do I go when I’m so repulsive only the mother of a marine biologist would ever date me??

1fxuyxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1fxuyxy/orgasm_triggers_urinary_retention/,orgasm triggers urinary retention???,"This is a very specific post y'all but please respond if it resonates. One of my symptoms is urinary retention. When I was diagnosed, I was having trouble initiating, emptying, morse code peeing, you name it. Like peeing out of a coffee straw. I have been catheterized once after trying the lowest dose of botox in the bladder which caused complete retention at the two week mark (wore off after a week). Now, I manage the retention with tamsulosin (Flomax) which I take .8 mg of daily. The side effects are shit, but its the only thing that helps. My PT identified a very tight pelvic floor (which tracks for my symptoms). I only just started PT so we will see how it helps. On the flomax, I have gotten the retention down to a minimum on the daily basis, so I am peeing and emptying (as long as I don't chug water too quickly, which will shock my system). Slow stream and may take some squirming, but good enough for now.

After orgasm (not penetrative, just external stimulation) that all goes out the window. I get what I call a “spasm” in my pelvic floor that causes extreme retention immediately after and for the following week or so (again, by retention I mean peeing, but through a coffee straw, trouble emptying so multiple trips, etc).

According to my PT, during orgasm, the pelvic floor contracts and releases. Clearly, mine struggles with the “release” part.

As someone who can't have penetrative sex, my partner and I are big into oral. Its exhausting having to tell him to stop every time I’m close to orgasm. It frustrates him more than me; he is very caring, and hates that I can't finish and he can (he always stops when I tell him to, I mean that he feels bad for my situation).

Tell me I’m not alone. Does anyone else have experience with this? Honestly, I’m blessed to have a partner who doesn't care about the penetrative sex thing, and is very happy with just doing oral/other things. But I’m tired of edging myself 😂🤦‍♂️ I’m like geez, can I have ONE THING! Also, because I never let myself finish, the built up frustration will come out in wet dreams in which I will wake up to an actual orgasm (insane, I know) completely beyond my control, triggering one of these flares! Then I’m riding the bathroom all week. I can't win. 

Anyway, advice please!!!!! ❤️

We recently met up after a break up last week. What should have been a quick hello and catching up led to coffee and the whole day being spent together. In one of our conversations, he expressed to me something truly heartbreaking. He is much older and has experienced heartbreak from a divorce years ago, unrequited love and a ton of other trauma.  He’s had a lot of struggles. He has been someone who always has a sense of gloom about him, no matter how he appears to the world. I think of him and sometimes think only of darkness despite how I attracted I am to him and how beautiful of a person he is. He has admitted that he often carries a bit of sadness but still moves on in life and lives the best he can. I don’t know if it’s because he’s a highly religious and spiritual person. He has always been supportive, positive and uplifting towards me, though. He often helps everyone around him and loves to be there for the community. So it’s definitely something internal that he has come to terms with.

Several days ago, he opened up to me that he thinks he might not find love again and that it seems impossible now. He told me that he wonders if he can live being alone forever. We both know that we can’t be together and have come to terms with it (sort of) but I’m definitely having trouble letting him go. And our last meeting has got me worrying about what he said. I want him to be happy. I want him to thrive and find love even if it’s not with me… but what he said broke my heart. I told him he experienced love before so it will happen again. 

I worry about him a lot. I worry for his safety. I worry if he is happy and in good company. I worry about his mental health. I know it is not my responsibility anymore as he has made it clear that he doesn’t think we should be together, but I am in love with him. I love him dearly and worry for his wellbeing. I’m afraid this feeling will suffocate me one day. It hurts to think of him and I don’t want to hurt anymore. I have cried way too much thinking of our memories.

What are my Health Risks?,"I have had terrible teeth for a good portion of my life, but things got really bad after I had a couple teeth removed right before the world shut down and the follow up appointments cancelled for over 2 years due to COVID.  At that point I’d moved and my teeth are going to be far too expensive to deal with now.  As you can see from my blurry photos, I clearly have damage and tooth loss, some whitening of the gums, and a ton of cavities.  I think gingivitis can be assumed.  

My issue is every time I look up what issues this can lead to, it’s either very vague, preventative, or jumps to bone cancer.  What are my actual health risks? I’m in pain all the time and it spreads to my ears and head often, so I want to do something about it without having to do it all at once.  

Besides mouthwash and brushing when tolerable (sometimes a nerve is exposed), flossing, and limiting soda and coffee to 2 total per day, what else can I do to preserve what I’ve got left until I can take out the right loan to deal with it?  Should I go in for each cavity as I can pay or will my provider freak at the state of my teeth and send me for expensive tests as has happened in the past?

Any advice will be appreciated beyond measure.  I’m so embarrassed and don’t know what to do.

I just wanted to share a little personal update and re-open the floor to something that gave my life a surprising turn this summer.

Some of you might remember that u/ET_Ferguson posted [“A Honey Dill Hail Mary” - For Singles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/1e3c7qb/a_honey_dill_hail_mary_for_singles/) on here a few months ago. In this thread, he acknowledged how bad dating apps could be and offered a fun alternative: Reddit. Single Winnipeg Redditors were encouraged to post a bit about themselves, and other Redditors were encouraged to reach out to anyone they found interesting.

Making any post like this was super out of my comfort zone, but I decided to take a leap and left a (now deleted) comment to introduce myself. Another Redditor decided to take a chance too and made the move to reach out. Fast forward two days, and we were grabbing coffee together. Almost three months later, we’re still going strong as a couple!

Since this thread worked for us, we wanted to repost it because it could work for you too. If you’re single, I encourage you to leave a comment to introduce yourself (and/or reach out to anyone you find interesting!). Here are some ideas you could add to your comment:

* Age/Sex
* What you’re looking for in a person/relationship
* Hobbies/Interests
* Work
* Invite people to reach out to you (I asked people to send me music if they didn’t know what to send, and it worked great!)

As with the last post, please keep it safe and positive! Good luck!",6,1728260175.0,Winnipeg,0,1.0,False

1fxuucg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/1fxuucg/the_spokane_ren_faire_from_a_maryland_ren_fest/,The Spokane Ren Faire from a Maryland Ren Fest Enjoyer -,"I was looking for information on the Spokane Ren Faire last week, but didn't see much information outside of a few grumps. So in the hopes of drumming up interest, I wanted to go ahead and write a detailed review of my experience as someone who's been to one of the bigger Ren Fests ""often.""

TLDR: I have one serious complaint, but otherwise, it's lovely and I'll be going back every year now.

So, I am a middle-aged man who has lived in Spokane for half my life, and lived in Maryland for about a quarter of it. We don't visit my family back home for Thanksgiving and Christmas; we visit for the Ren Fest. In other words, I have very strong feelings about such things. The things I expect based on the Maryland Ren Fest would be environment, shopping, food, people-watching, and events.

**Environment:** Set your expectations appropriately. This isn't one of those major festivals where they can have several miles worth of village sitting around for 10 months of the year to be brought out for a weekend. That's why the tickets are $20. Everything is temporary so it can be set up Friday and cleared out Monday. There's some tents whose owners are trying really hard to look Renaissance-y, and those are absolutely lovely. But they're going to have to hike the ticket prices to buy their own land before they can have what you'd get in a major city. Just be... Faire to them.

That being said, there is a lot to be said for the fact that they have this massive empty field to work with. This massive, *flat* empty field. If you are, say, a smidge older than a middle-aged man, you might not enjoy large flights of stairs. There's handicapped parking close to the front ""gates"" as well.

Yes, the walk from the main parking is long. This is a Renaissance Festival tradition. And again, it's comparatively flat. (Also, when we got back to our SUV the tire had not been pierced by a giant nail. That's another story.)

Another thing I really appreciated was that they had a large central area and a smaller area dedicated just to open seating. Despite how many people I saw throughout the day, the sitting area wasn't full; it's half-covered, so it was a very nice setup.

**Shopping:** yes. There's a large number of artisan vendors, small stuff, all sorts of jewelry, appropriately witch or faerie related kiffle, toy swords... What I absolutely loved was how many game and game related tents there were. I picked up a jar of D&D dice for myself, D&D dice earrings for my daughter, my wife got this cool Backgammon board made from leather and designed to be ""pulled up"" into a pouch with a drawstring... three different locations. Uncles Games also had a large tent but, um, I already spend too much time in their store...

Honestly, the only thing I saw which seemed totally out of place was Maverick. At the best location, right next to the best coffee shop, so more power to them...

**Food:** i like the grilled cheese place.

So, again, it was a lot of food trucks, but also some little artisan places (always support the Scone Ranger.) There was a place selling proper funnel cakes from the halls of Valhalla, or at least the 10 year old helping his dad was shouting that which I loved.

**People Watching:** Sometimes Spokane seems too serious. This was not one of those places. I would say a good 35-40% of people were there in costume. Even at the food trucks, all the workers seemed to be dressing up somehow. It made me very happy. And for the record, I was the guy in a black laced-up shirt, a forest green kilt, and, tragically, sneakers.

But oh my God, guys, they allow well behaved dogs on leashes and *so many of the dogs had costumes on and it was so wonderful*... If you're the one with the big golden shorthaired dog with the runes on the collar and the knife, and you see this, I love you.

(For the people who go to Ren Fests enough for the costume drinking game: We had Shrek, Link, the Buster Sword despite not otherwise being in costume, and of course Flawless Cosplay Of A Character That Doesn't Fit But They Deserved To Get To Pull It Out Of The Closet Goddamnit.)

**Events:** And now, I must be a bitch. The hosts absolutely need to improve their event locations.

I headed to the Gala Terrace to see an abridged version of ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" scheduled for 1:00pm. We got there 10-15 minutes before the show and got to barely hear the Twisted Knickers, and then barely hear Much Ado About Nothing. We were seated 15 feet from the stage.

But Wyvern, you might say, isn't that the fault of the performers? First off, no; the stages should have been set up with speakers and microphones so everyone could hear clearly, especially since it was clear that they were volunteering, not hired entertainment.

More importantly, though, the Gala Terrace is advertised as the Main Stage. It is located by ye olde privies (that's the bathrooms) which means there was a water truck loudly pumping water to the sinks. Not that I'm unhappy about sinks! But if this is an important area, don't put it right next to a pumping station. But once you drowned that out, it was also right next to a blacksmith. Who did lessons. Who can forget the famous quote, ""He that hath a \[TINK! TINK! TINK!\] than a youth, and he that \[TINK! TINK! TINK!\] than a man: and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that \[TINK! TINK! TINK!\], I am not for him.""

You sell more food and drink (and Capital ""D"" drink) if you get people to stay longer. You get people to stay longer by giving them places to be. Put the stages in better places, give them sound systems and microphones so the sound can carry farther than 5 feet, and put some walls behind them to direct the sound forward at least a little bit.

Like I said up top: It's not a permanent fixture. But you need to invest in the stages, because you want asses on uncomfortable wooden seats so that those asses will get thirsty in the sun and go to buy beverages.

Anyway... yes, I will be a regular, especially since my wife looked at other men in kilts and got jealous that her man didn't have better boots. I hope to see you there next year.",1,1728260072.0,Spokane,0,1.0,False

Hi there! I’m just a guy driving across the country right now with my puppers. I’m really not looking for any emotional entanglements…I just want to kinda talk or hang out or whatever. I guess I’m going through a lot in my life, and I’ve always been self reliant. I guess it’s been working less and less lately, the more tragic the situation becomes (shocker, I know). Anyway, I’m certainly open to things in the future but right now I just have to process and let some things run their course in my mind. 

I guess about me, well I’m a blue collar man born and raised in Maryland. I’m Puerto Rican and Italian mixed, 5’5 and maybe 220/30 but that’s gunna keep dropping till it’s 150/160 (you can ask what I started at this year if you want lmao). I ended up moving to Nevada for a woman when I was 19, and now I’m headed back home 13 years later. I’m a pretty traditional man, I’m emotionally aware and I try my best to be mindful even though we all fail cause it’s freakin tough. I’m quite cynical, but also really joyous. Maybe joyous for the ones around me, quite the cynic for myself 😂. I’m compassionate and empathetic genuinely. I am not someone who is defined by the media I consume, or my hobbies. I just want that to be clear, lol. I am absolutely so much more than those things, and I hope you are too. I do the right thing as much as I can, I’ve always had this philosophy of I have to live with myself at the end of my life, not you so I just want to do what’s best always. I guess I can be a people pleaser, but I’m trying to allow myself to exist more which has been hard after everything but here I am. I guess if I HAVE to list my hobbies, anything outside in nature, anything inside involving someone close, no more gaming for me sorry enough life has passed me by but if YOU do that’s cool I’m very familiar :), I guess I smoke weed while I can LOL idk how I feel about this specific thing currently but I think it’s just because of my old job. I love to cook, I was trained by a chef in my early days (you don’t get to be this big without making good food ;] CRINGE). Despite my size, I do full body compound workouts (dumbbells only sit on your kettlebells jkjk), and I eat about 1200 calories a day at max so I mean…I’m going to get the results I want lmao. Sorry this is a ramble of bullshit but if any of it made sense or seemed interesting to you, hit me up :). If the conversation goes well, I’m open to meeting up for coffee or something idk(I’d imagine this is for a special case? Idk just making it known it’s possible). We are all adults, and this is the first time in 15 years that I haven’t worked for stretch of time so…I guess I deserve to take my time right? Hope to hear from you <3

If a picture is what you’re after, yours gets mine. 
If a friend is what you need, I’m always here. 
If you just want to listen to someone and get off, go use another sub, so weird.

Like many of you, I’ve tried different methods to shed those extra pounds, some worked, some didn’t, and others just left me feeling frustrated. 

But recently, I came across **LeanBean**, one of the top-rated natural weight loss supplements on Amazon, and it’s been really helpful for me.

Here's what I love about it:

* **Natural, Safe Ingredients**: It’s made from all-natural compounds like turmeric, cayenne pepper, and garcinia cambogia.
* **Appetite Suppression**: Glucomannan really helped me stay full between meals, so it’s easier to avoid snacking.
* **Boosts Metabolism**: The added caffeine from green coffee beans gave me that extra energy push, especially during workouts.
* **Great for Women**: LeanBean is specifically designed with women’s bodies in mind, focusing on reducing cravings and increasing energy in a balanced way.
* **No Crazy Stimulants**: It’s effective without overloading you with harsh stimulants.



A Few Drawbacks:

* **Mild Digestive Upset**: During the first few days, I experienced some mild bloating, but it passed once my body adjusted to the fiber content.
* **Multiple Capsules**: You have to take six capsules a day (two with each meal), which is a bit of a hassle for me.



It has been a really solid addition to my weight loss journey. 

Although it’s not a quick fix, when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise, it helps curb cravings and boost energy. 

If you're looking for a natural aid for weight loss and you're willing to put in the effort alongside it, I’d definitely recommend giving it a try.

I buy groceries, I say, “this is all I’m spending for the week.” The next day comes and a flood of impulses every day to buy things I don’t need and leave work early because my job is fucking BORING and insufferable. I try resisting them but they always get the better of me. I can’t make myself do simple tasks like making coffee from my French press because that involves boiling water first and then steeping it and then pouring it after 5 minutes and that’s just too much for my stupid fucking brain. It can only handle the path of least resistance. So out I go to get Red Bulls every day. 

I can’t plan for shit. I cannot eat before I go to work or make meals “meal prep” in advance, it just doesn’t fucking work. I’m too forgetful, I’m too disorganized, I have absolutely 0 motivation to do a goddamn thing never mind cook a large meal and then attempt to portion it into stupid plastic containers that I’m just going to end up losing in 2 weeks anyway. Even if I do try to “meal prep”  I’ll just end up forgetting it at home. 

I’m constantly annoyed by everything- my long hair that I can do nothing with because I feel ugly no matter what I do with it, eating is annoying and gross, many sounds grate on my nerves, just everything is a daily annoyance and I’m overstimulated more often than not.

I’m doomed to make $15 an hour because I have no marketable skills. To obtain “marketable skills” I have to discipline myself to sit down and learn them (like coding, IT basics) which is nearly impossible for me because I have absolutely zero (0) drive. I can’t be a server either to make more money because my shitty brand of ADHD makes me the incompetent fucktard. So until I can somehow magically make myself learn the skills I need to get a better paying job, I’m doomed to earning 15 bucks an hour doing mind-numbingly boring shit like stand around at a podium in a boring hardware store and ask passerby’s to sign up for sweepstakes to win some windows. 

I used to be smart, I used to learn effortlessly when I was in school but I feel like I’ve dumbed down quite a bit. 

I just can’t keep up with existence, it’s too expensive and demanding, and my brain does not want to cooperate whatsofuckingever. It’s like I was set up to fucking fail. ",5,1728258946.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

I tapered slowly to zero over 3-4 weeks, and now i’m 4 weeks of zero. 

Here are the results: 

1) My sleep quality is up a lot. I fall asleep quickly and sleep more soundly.

2) when i wake up i don’t feel like a train hit me until i have coffee. 

3) Far less anxiety. I have a stressful job and i can’t believe how even keel i feel. It’s amazing. 

4) I feel more in tune with my body - muscles, etc. 

5) A little more concentration during the workday. 

It took a while to get there though. While tapering avoided headaches, I still felt a “pressure” in my forehead. Not bad or enough to impact my life, but i would feel it when I sat and tuned into my body. That’s only recently gone away, and I’d say it’s 85% gone, so need a few more weeks to get to 100% gone. It has slowly but steadily improved. 

In the first two weeks of zero I felt groggy a lot. That has now dropped to near zero, and I feel very awake when I wake up.

Finally, it oddly feels like there is more time in the day to do things. Maybe this is related to the reduced anxiety. 

All in all it’s been worth it, though it can take a while - longer than just getting through the first week  obvious withdrawal symptoms.",6,1728258489.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I’ve been struggling to decide on where to move next now that I’ve finished my degree. I figured you guys are the experts on that :) 

I am looking for a city that fits this wishlist: 

-Walkable enough: I’ll still have a car but I’d love to be able to walk around places for something like a morning coffee from my apartment or maybe some errands.

-Midsize to large: I love big city feels, but this can be compromised on if the city punches above its weight in other things like walkability or job market. 

-Diverse food: I am going to miss things like the amazing Mexican food in San Diego and having some great food options would lessen that blow. 

-Job market: I would be working in the IT sector, specifically with roles in networking. I’d like to find a city where I can find a good amount of jobs in that field. 

-Seasons: I love the fall, and would love an area that has beautiful seasons. I can deal with the winter but I’d prefer less of a snowy season, but I also understand that you probably need the snow to have the beautiful greens and fall season. 

Proximity to national parks is a plus but not a need. Cities with historical relevance are also awesome but again not a need! 

I am born and raised in north county San Diego, and while I know that for many this is a dream city, it has always felt a little slower/more boring to me. I don’t mean to be ungrateful, but I never go to the beach and I am craving a bigger city adventure (mainly for the walkability).

So I guess I'll start. Prepare your asses for this one. It's gonna be a long as hell paragraph.

I wish not to share my personal identity because there is a high chance they might find this, but I'll start with this: In 2022, I had decided to go back to school face to face after two years of staying at home because of the pandemic. The first half of freshmen year started off really great. I made a lot of friends, and they all loved me for my personality. They see me as a kind, caring, and funny person, and thus, I love myself for who I am. However, there are two ""friends"" who have been making high school somewhat of a rollercoaster ride for me. I wish not to reveal their names, so I'll call the first person Travis and the second person Kyle. There was a third friend who was involved in this, but he dropped out in the middle of Semester 2 of my freshmen year. I'll call that one Cooper. All of us met in the 2nd half of the 1st semester. We share the same interests, whether it be video Games, TV shows, and movies, my biggest example 2022 DreamWorks Animation film, The Bad Guys. They were mostly tolerable throughout said semester, but when the 2nd semester began, that's when their behavior has changed for the worse. Not helping was that 2023 was basically a rough year for me, and the following was one of the main reasons why.

I think the first sign of his true colors showing was when Travis tried to steal my lunch box, and I, trying to hold onto it, fell onto the floor. Travis, still trying to steal it, dragged me across the floor in the process. Another friend of mine, who I'll call Nichelle, took notice of this, and shouted at Travis. I couldn’t remember what she said to him, but I think it was something about him bullying me and “If I ever see you pull this bullshit again, I’ll tell the principle about this!” After that, Travis apologized to me for it, and never made another attempt to take my lunch box. I thought this was the only ""incident"" I had with him, but little did I know, this was only the beginning.

Now, before I get onto the next action, some people know I have an amazing talent for drawing. In fact, I have made many drawings on my computer, from logos such as Disney, Universal, Paramount, Warner Bros, 20th Century Fox, etc, to characters like Bluey, Stewie Griffin, The Powerpuff Girls, Thomas the Tank Engine, and more. Prior to the 2nd semester, Tunis complimented my drawings, but one day in said semester, he requested me to draw the logo of a website that I can’t mention for obvious reasons. I bluntly and clearly said I would not do that, but he laughed about it. 

If that wasn’t enough, he would later make inappropriate and nonsensical jokes about my logo drawings, telling me to “stop drawing logos that represent porn.” I told him to stop and that his jokes weren’t funny, but he wouldn’t listen and just kept laughing about it, and had the audacity to say “I’m not joking, I’m serious.” He even threatened to call the cops on me if I kept drawing them (Note: He was most likely bluffing, but it’s still disrespectful). Because of his obnoxious jokes, it initially deprived some of my enjoyment of drawing, but thankfully I got back my passion.

On the topic of inappropriate things, every time I tried to do my work, or was just simply minding my own business, Tunis would pull his phone out, and show me NSFW and 18+ videos. Now I can’t describe the videos he showed me because they are THAT unsuitable. I’d tell him, “Please get that off the phone, no one wants to see that stuff,” but he’d keep laughing and shoving them into my face.

Another time, I made friends with a girl in my PE class, whom I'll call Molly. When Travis, Kyle, and Cooper knew about this, they would make jokes about her being my girlfriend, when in reality we’re just friends. They knew this, and just continued to joke about it. This made her mad. She told them “Shut up, I already have a boyfriend,” but they kept joking.

One time in World History, Cooper walked up to me, pulled out his phone and started flashing its flashlight at me. I told him “Stop it, that’s hurting my eyes,” (I'm not epileptic but he was flashing it very fast) but he kept laughing and continued to do it. I told him again to stop, but he wouldn’t listen. Thankfully, another person told him to stop, and he did. But it didn’t stop there. Another day in said class, he took pictures and videos of me (even putting Snapchat filters) without my consent. I told him “I did not give you permission to take these pictures of me.” I would later find out he took all these pictures and videos and made them into a random TikTok edit.

The first time Travis actually made me mad was when we, along with Kyle, were on a group slide in ELA, he took a picture of some guy (with his shirt off, for crying out loud) and plastered it onto my slide. I was like, “Dude, that does not belong in that slide.” Afterwards, I deleted the image. I look at the entire presentation to see if he did the same thing to the other slides. He did, on one. “Please stop, this isn’t funny,” I told him. But he didn’t listen to me.

The secondary teacher, who I'll call Ms. Adams, even knew about this, and also told him to stop. And what does he do? **He spams the image on every single slide.** It took me literally minutes to delete them all while he just sat on his chair, laughing. “Tunis!” Ms. Adams said. “Not funny!” But he didn’t even care. He just kept on laughing.

Another time in that exact same class, in a project about creativity, I drew the letters in the style of a rainbow. It is worth noting that Travis is homophobic (meaning that he hates gay people or any individuals who are part of the LGBTQ+ community) and I’m not. Not that I’m gay myself, but unlike Travis, I’m not judgemental towards anyone, let alone gay people. Anyways, back to the topic: Travis took notice, and told me “Why did you put a rainbow on there? Rainbows are just for gay people, in fact that’s where rainbows came from.” In reality, rainbows originated from mother nature. He knew this, but he kept saying horrible things about gay people. I had to change the color scheme of those letters to stop hearing about his horrible protests about these people. All of that over a rainbow. Also, every time we played a Gimkit or Blooket game, he would join in with my name. I told him to stop, but he continued to do it.

There were those who sympathized with me, like a teacher who I'll call Mrs. Miller and her daughter, who I'll call Emily. When one day in Educational Support, where Kyle threw insults at me, she stood up for me. She even said “I don’t understand what’s the problem with Josh!” I can’t remember much from that day, but I do know that Kyle did all of that as a sick joke. When at other times Travis and Kyle would mess with me in the class, Mrs. Miller would shout out “Stop it, Tunis! That is not acceptable behavior!” I can even remember one time when a girl who I'll call Lilly said something like “You guys are always torturing this poor gentleman when he’s trying to do his own thing!”

As the semester went on, Travis went to more screwed up measures, such as physically assaulting me, tricking me, and even hurling **racial insults** at me. I’m talking: the repeated usage of the N-word, monkey jokes, saying that I looked overcooked and a whole bunch of horrible stuff. It was stuff like these that really made my fist clench. However, as much as I wanted to throw it at him and give him what he deserves, I’ve been taught that violence is not the answer. That only made things no better, as he, along with Clyde, would do more in PE. They untied my shoes on purpose, tried to steal my belongings, threw their backpacks at me, dragged me off the stairs, tried to pull me under the curtains, threw my stuff under the curtains, purposefully stomped on my feet, tripped me over while jogging, and even one time took my shoe off and kicked it when I tried to get it back.

Whenever Travis felt angry or upset, he would take his anger out on me like a punching bag. One time when I had gotten a haircut, Travis made fun of it. I may not remember what he said about it, but it might’ve been something about the barber who cut my hair getting drunk while doing his job. One time in PE class, Travis took out a pin needle and stabbed me in the arm with it. Now I wasn’t even bleeding or anything, but it still seriously hurt. And when I was drinking my water after that class, Cooper ran out of nowhere and slapped my cheek, causing the water to spill everywhere.

And this just went on and on. Every day, they always find new ways to make my life at school a living hell. I’d even go through more of their shenanigans and antics, just getting worse than before. I’ve been gaslit, taken advantage of, as well as blackmailed by them. I keep asking myself these questions: Why me? What did I do to deserve this? What is all of this my punishment for?

I know most of you have heard of scenarios where the administrator refuses to take notice, but this isn't one of them. Admin has been notified of this. One time, I was pulled out of PE class by the principal, who I'll call Mr. Williams, for a talk. I knew I wasn't in trouble and had no reason to be, so I asked him ""Hey, is something wrong?"" Mr. Williams been informed of my situation, telling me that “there have been various claims that two people have been picking on you, showing you inappropriate images and videos, and physically assaulting you.” I remained silent for a few seconds, trying to word this the best way I could, before I just simply told him the truth. I’ve been told by him, along with Mrs. Miller, that if this continues, tell them. I told them I would inform them if they keep doing stuff like this.

From what I've witnessed, I wasn't really alone. There’s this guy, who I'll call Alex, who Travis and Kyle despised. One time, when they were drawing on the board, Alex wanted to have a turn on it, but they selfishly said, “No, this is our board, you’re not allowed to draw on it.” Another time, Travis and Alex were in some sort of conflict (I can’t remember what), and instead of settling it like a dignified individual, Travis pushed Alex onto the floor (**and right in front of Emily too**). It made me, and some others, feel sorry for Alex.

I know I was told to tell someone if this continues, but they’ve threatened that if they caught me “snitching on them,” they would spread rumors about me, probably to destroy my reputation. I know they were most likely bluffing, but what are the odds they weren't? Losing my friends was one of my worst fears, but what I refused to acknowledge at the time is that I lost the three guys I considered ""friends"" a long time ago.

A few weeks after this threat, it looked like Kyle learned his lesson, as he hasn’t picked on me for a while. And I won’t have to worry about Cooper anymore, even know, since during this time, he has been transferred to another school. Travis, on the other hand, didn't change much. Yes, the inappropriate videos and images have stopped at this time, but now he showed me jumpscare videos to scare me, and has actually succeeded in that. In addition, he still continued to harass me with the N-word and his monkey jokes, and still joined in with my name whenever we’re doing a game in ELA. Even one time when we were playing Trust No One, he made multiple people join in with my name and had the audacity to make them kick me off the game.

Another day in the aforementioned class, Travis wrapped his jacket around my face, making it seriously impossible for me to breathe, especially since I had my mask on. Ms. Adams saw and told Travis off, though I couldn’t remember what she said. Another time in PE, Travis kept pestering me by grabbing my arm and then pushed me down the stairs. He claims it was an “accident,” but I highly doubt it. A few hours later, while everyone was doing their own thing, I was pretty much resting since I had nothing to do. And then from out of nowhere, Travis woke me up by throwing his backpack right on me. He said he did this because “your dick was showing.”

Travis would also tease me by snatching one of my belongings away from me and trying to stop me from getting it back, and then throw it right at my face. He even mocks me by making an impression of me, while saying inappropriate things about me. He basically makes me look like I do inappropriate things. Worst yet, he has even managed to make other people turn against me and make them harass me as well.

Whenever anyone stood up for me or called him out for his actions, he would rant about how people should “shut up and mind their fucking business.” When a girl I'll name Kimberly called out Travis for making a monkey joke about me, he threw insults at her, saying that she knows nothing about us and called her stuff that I can’t even remember, though the only thing I could remember is that he said she looked more like a male than a female or something like that. One thing I can fully remember, though, is that when he brought up Nichelle, he called her a “sasquatch.” Sometimes, he would try to walk off scot-free, by either changing the story or playing victim by making me look like the villain. I could also remember one time in World History, I just heard from Kimberly herself that Travis knocked down her coffee and ran off. At first, I thought it was an accident, but she said he didn’t come back to clean up what he caused or didn’t do as little as apologize, so that confirms that it was no accident.

When I had started my sophomore year in 10th grade, I was kind of relieved when I learned that Travis had no classes with me. So, he has not given me trouble since I have no classes with him for now, but that doesn’t mean that he’s changed. If anything, he has probably continued his antics. Every time we meet in the hallway, he continues to mock me and make fake impressions of me, and one time, when I was in the room with Mrs. Miller, two girls (I can't remember either of their names) said that Travis did something in which I can’t remember, so I guess you could say that Tunis has found new targets. Not only this, but Travis has continued to influence some other kids in my classrooms. What I mean by that is everytime we play a Kahoot, Gimkit or anything like that, these kids would join in with my name, the exact thing Travis did in my classrooms back in 9th grade. Travis may not be in my classrooms anymore, but that doesn’t mean everything he’s done to me was forgotten about. When I started the second semester in this year, I learned that this was far from over.

Out of all of my classes is semester 2 of my sophomore year, Travis and Kyle were in one class: Geometry, so I wasn't too stressed. Travis not only remained unchanged, but he had gotten worse. He’s shown himself to be a pathological liar. From what I (and the rest of the class) have heard, Travis has had a record for getting written up back in his English class (I didn't share the same English class with him at the time, and I'll refer to the English teacher as Ms. Palmer). When Mrs. Miller listed everything he did, he gaslighted the entire class. The same thing happened when I brought up his antics. He attempted to gaslight me by either blaming it on Cooper or saying nothing happened at all, even when I remember full and well what had happened. And now every time HE brings it up, he switches the story around, saying that I did the things he did and that he was the victim.

It only got worse from there. Every time I’m watching my favorite shows or movies (e.g. Thomas the Tank Engine, Bluey, Powerpuff Girls, Transformers, Percy Jackson, TMNT 2012) on my phone (which I had gotten between Christmas and New Years), he accuses me of “watching porn.” And unfortunately, it looks like Kyle has returned to assisting Tunis in terms of harassing me. I could also hear Travis and Kyle talking about me behind my back on several different occasions.

Even during the end of that year, nothing changed. One Thursday, Travis came back to school after he had COVID. He came to Portuguese Culture and suddenly started coughing near me. I had to back away but that ended with me falling off my own chair. Travis was told to leave the class after this. Thankfully I didn't get the virus, though. In Geometry, one time he attempted to frame me for copying off his Study Guide by placing his next to mine and shouting “O.P. copied off me, he's a cheater,” and another time he accused me of selling drugs to him when, obviously, I never did such thing. This reminded me of a time where, in Spanish class, another guy I'll call Harry said that he would “put me on drugs.” My Spanish teacher who I'll call Ms. Carmen immediately wrote him up for saying that.

Currently, I am now a junior in 11th grade. Of course, nothing has changed one bit. Travis and Kyle are in, not one, but two classes of mine (and they're expected to be in another class with me in Semester 2). On the first day of this year, I had recently gotten yellow Jordans my mom had gotten me prior to that day. Travis said these Jordans were trash and threatened to jump me if he ever saw me wearing them again. The only other things that they’ve done so far are harassing another person named I'll call Amy, talking down on me, gossiping about me behind my back, invading my privacy and personal space, and accusing me of things I didn’t do. Not just this, but another person who I'll call Za'Darius, has now joined them in terms of harassing me. He’d deliberately disturb me while I’m working, made inappropriate jokes about me, and one time shouted at me “Your dick is hanging out your pants!”

A week ago, Travis and Kyle hit a new low I did not expect at all. Travis got caught on his phone for calling Kyle's father. How did he get the number? They literally found a website that if you search up someone’s name, their phone number, house address, or any other information might show up. I tried to brush it off as another one of their sick pranks, but today, I looked on Travis’ computer screen and found out it was real. Now I’m terrified he might actually find my house address and there is a possibility it might happen because Tunis said something along the lines of “You’re next.” 

Before anyone who is reading this asks, yes, I’m fine now, but I was just a little shaken up inside during the time. But mainly I felt uneasy and violated, because I felt like I was straight up being stalked. I’m not sure if he was bluffing in a sick manner or not, but even if it was, invasion of privacy is literally no joke. No one should feel unsafe in their own home. Thankfully the principle caught the two before they could do anything, and again, he did tell me to inform him if anything else happens again.

I never thought I'd see the day where I'd have to share this here, but this has been going on for so long that I feel like I have to share this. I know what I have to do, but I don't think I have the strength to do it. I feel like if I cut ties with them, drama will spread all over the place. All of this could just be me being sensitive, but the threat of them spreading rumors about me still runs in my mind, and as I said, losing my reputation is one of my worst fears. And I never told my parents/guardians about any of this. I really don't want to drag them into this. I don’t think they deserve to be involved in this.

TL;DR: My toxic ""friends"" have been causing trouble for me in high school for nearly a year. Administrators have noticed, yet these ""friends"" have not learned their lesson. I feel like cutting ties with them, but they might spread rumors about me. And I don't know if I have the strength to do what I have to in order to put an end to this madness once and for all.",5,1728258216.0,AmITheJerk,3,1.0,False

1fxu6h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PenangTravelTips/comments/1fxu6h9/hidden_gems_in_penang_heres_my_experience/,Hidden Gems in Penang – Here’s My Experience!,"Hey everyone! I recently took a trip to Penang and while I hit up the usual spots (George Town, etc.), I made it a point to check out a few hidden gems that aren’t talked about as much. Thought I’d share my experience in case anyone’s looking for something off the beaten path:

1.	Hin Bus Depot – This place is super cool if you’re into art and culture. It’s an old bus depot turned art space with rotating exhibits, murals, and weekend markets. I ended up spending a couple of hours here just wandering around and grabbing coffee from one of the stalls.

2.	Pantai Kerachut – If you’re up for a bit of hiking, this beach is worth it. It’s quiet, with hardly any tourists. The real highlight, though, is that it’s a turtle nesting site! The hike was peaceful, and it felt like a nice break from the busier beaches.

3.	Air Itam Dam – This one’s perfect if you want to escape the city. It’s a bit of a drive but totally worth it. The views from up there are stunning, and it’s super calm—great for a morning walk or just chilling out.

These were some of my favorite hidden spots in Penang, but I’m sure there are more. Anyone else have hidden gems they’d recommend? Would love to hear what other places I should check out next time!

1fxu6ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1fxu6ba/i_finally_broke_through_my_plateau_at_200_lbs_i/,I finally broke through my plateau at 200 lbs. I am officially down 29.6 lbs. ,"F/36/5'6"" \[226.6 lbs > 197 lbs = 29.6\] In the last year I've lost 29.6 lbs. Over the last several months I've been trying to be more consistent. I was stuck near 200 lbs and finally hit 197 lbs. I also ordered a new pair of jeans one size down and I wasn't sure if they would fit, but I received them this weekend and they fit perfectly! I think I am going to order the same pair in one more size down. I would like to lose another 40 to 50 lbs. 

 I've had some health issues recently that has pushed me to get some help from my doctor and I had two appointments with a nutritionist. My calcium was high, my vitamin D and iron were low. I have started vitamins for those issues and I am actually starting to feel a bit better.   


The biggest change with the nutritionist is consistency. I've lost weight before. I know how to eat healthy, but staying consistent has been a challenge especially with having a family who does not like to eat the same as me and a very picky toddler. My health insurance actually covers the cost of the nutritionist, which is fantastic. 

Here are some tips that have helped me break through this plateau. You may already know this, but it has really helped. 

1. Portion your plate 1/2 plate of fruit and/or veg, 1/4 plate of lean protein, 1/4 plate of whole grain carbs. I don't always eat the lean protein or whole grains, but I try and I still portion this way even if it's less healthy foods. 

2. Start exercising. Choose anything and start with 3 days a week. I am up to 4-5 days a week 20-25 minutes. I have gone through points in life of being pretty active and eating well and other points where I lived off toast and ginger ale through rough pregnancies. I usually walk, do a yoga or full body exercise video on YouTube. 

3. Over coming my addiction to caffeine and soda. To be honest this was probably my biggest issue health wise. Coffee with cream and Mount Dew were my addiction the last couple of years. It was very hard to give those up, go through caffeine withdrawals, especially while getting little sleep after having my 3rd baby. I am 1 year post partum and drink mostly water, sparkling water, and decaf coffee or tea here and there. 

4. Dealing with stress has been very helpful as well. I get a lot of tension headaches, probably caused from stress and lack of sleep. I find walking alone in the evening to help. I also like to relaxed with the heating pad on my neck and a cup of tea and playing a game on my phone or listening to an audiobook after the kids go to bed. 

6. Making bigger meals and portioning out leftovers to put in the freezer. It has definitely save me a few times around lunch time and if I didn't have anything planned for dinner. I can take out a few leftovers and have a prepared healthy meal. 

7. Keep frozen vegetables, frozen fruit and buy some unrip fruits. I do a lot of my shopping 2 weeks at a time and by the time I get to the end of the second week I am running out of fruits/veg, but stocking up on frozen or unripe fruit has been helping to make sure I can portion my plates. 

I hope these tips can help you too! ",18,1728258015.0,loseit,2,1.0,False
1fxu5j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1fxu5j6/family_and_fans_the_portable_kind/,"Family and Fans, the portable kind","I (45 female) wanted to share an experience about the stigma of Menopause and the forceful silencing of some older than me generation women and some men.  

My partner and I attended my older brother’s 47th birthday celebration at my mother’s along with my grandmother, nephew, nephew’s life long friend and his wife. 

I was sitting on the floor in a den that is open off of the kitchen.
My nephew and his friend and wife were sitting in the couches and chairs in the den that surround a coffee table. They were ogling my battery operated DeWalt portable fan that I never leave at home, EVER. 

My partner was kind enough to buy me this fan last January when I was in the midst of an illness. The illness in short was early menopause caused my two small brain tumors on my pituitary gland . These tumors were formed due to hormones, specifically elevated prolactin. Prolactin is the called the “pregnancy hormone”.

Now, I know what you're thinking and how delusional it may sound at first glance to be in search of genuine friendships (even more so on platforms such as reddit), but, oh well, here goes nothing. lol

I guess a more accurate description of the friendship I'm after would be the kind we all find ourselves (now at an older age) feeling nostalgic about. The og kind from our younger days (or perhaps one you've always dreamed of but never got to experience yourself). As silly as it may sound, I remember bumping randomly into a post years ago that showed a group of friends having a dinner night over call and you could tell the energy their smiles radiated was next lvl of wholesomeness. I always thought to my anxious self ""I wish I had that"". Now, with Halloween being just around the corner, I catch myself thinking about it more often than not. I think it'd be pretty neat if I had someone I could randomly take on some candy shopping over call or plan a spontaneous trip to the coffee shop, or walk in the park and talk about life.

Just to make it extra clear - I'm only looking for PLATONIC interactions.

If you still haven't dipped two feet out and may be curious about the person who you may or may not befriend, here are a few words about me lol :

I'm deeply passionate about the hobbies I take interest in. A very mindful, very demure selection of them would be **writing**, **watching movies and tv series** (a single epi could easily spawn into 10) and just having a blast breaking down different scenes (either for the sake of seeking a deeper/symbolical meaning behind it or rewind a certain part 5 different times for pure shxts and giggles). I also study Acting, so I guess the prior is a good example of finding the perfect balance between fun and work. I love educating myself on different mythologies and anything Ancient History-based. On instances when I've got more time on my hands, I also dabble in the gaming world. A few titles you'd most often catch me running would be examples, such as **Destiny 2**, **Smite**, **Gunfire Reborn** or the more laid-back kind like **Sims 4** or **House Flipper**. I've got other games too and am open to exploring new ones, should we get along.

I think the description is enough to paint a good first impression of the person I am. You're more than welcome to slide into my dms and introduce yourself. :)

I could care less about about gender and ethnicity background, I only ask you to be 18+.

Our entire school received an email notifying us of this and baristas also received an email from HR giving a website where we can find new jobs. They changed the locks to the coffee shop, informed we would receive our last pay check on the 11th, and said we would be closed indefinitely. Our coffee shop is also 100% student run except for the fact that we have an advisor. They usually market our school positively for having this space. However, they have begun calling us a “college owned student run coffee shop”. 

The coffee shop had a Palestinian flag up. They said it wasn’t up to show international support. So, we put up various flags from different countries. They claimed that our coffee shop was violating school protocol, but failed to point out what exact clause we were violating. They could only point to the poster policy within our student life guidebook which does not discuss decorations. They also backtracked on saying specifically the Palestinian flag, because I believe they realized it is a Title VI allegation to say we have to take down one flag. They were stating up until we closed that all our decorations must come down and be approved. Now me and 50 other employees are out of our jobs. We are also majority work study…which means many students receive federal funding. Any advice on what we can do to get our jobs back or is this something that cannot be solved? Some have mentioned reporting them to US Department of Education. Others have talked about speaking to lawyers about Title VI. However, most of us are on the same page about keeping the flag up. Regardless of the politics envolved, our coffee shop has historically been a political space and we do not want our schools Admin to feel as though they have a say in what we can and can’t put up. This goes against the history of our establishment. 

Although they did not give us any notice of the closing, technically we weren’t fired…since the establishment was simply closed. Just hoping for any advice and appreciate the time you’ve put into reading this post. ",0,1728257184.0,legaladvice,4,0.43,False

I figured those friendships were just built for high school and not meant to last long term. This friendship, however, hits differently. 
 
We were really good friends for basically 10 years, and I will say that when I started dating my husband, the friendship shifted.  Not in a bad way. Right after I started dating my husband, I went back to school and started working 2 jobs 7 days a week. I got super busy, and honestly, I feel like we both could've done better with trying to spend more time with one another, but hey, life happens. 

I really noticed that our friendship had changed when she started dating her now fiancé. I messaged her and asked her about him, and she told me that a lot of people didn't know cause she wanted to keep her relationship private. I felt bad cause I knew before this was something she would've immediately told me. I got engaged, and I reached out to her and told her I missed our friendship and really wanted to connect again.  She agreed, and shortly after, she got engaged herself. She did message me pictures and let me know. We also met up for a coffee date once, but I noticed when trying to set that up, it was a lot of ""well if you want to"" between the two of us. I asked her to be a bridesmaid in my wedding. I'm not a bridesmaid in hers, and I completely respect the fact that it's her wedding and her choice, but it still kind of stings. I would love to see her more but I'm also trying to give her some space because her wedding is next month and I know after having my own almost a month ago how stressful planning can be.

I’ve been in therapy on and off since 2019, which has helped me better understand and manage my thoughts. I also have unresolved trauma from my teenage years involving my parents, which still affects me today. Although I have no contact with them now, those past experiences sometimes resurface.

I’m a proud father of a 3-year-old boy and a 1-year-old girl, and I’m happily married to the love of my life. Professionally, I’ve been recognized as valuable in my field, earning a good salary while working from home with flexibility—perfect for parenting. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea last year, but it’s under control with a CPAP machine.

I don't drink alcohol, neither coffee because of physical symptoms of anxiety.

Recently, life has been tough for several reasons:

* Parenting triggers old memories, and I’ve been having nightmares about my parents, leading to panic attacks or waking up extremely anxious.
* I had to spend 6 weeks in my hometown for family reasons, which spiked my anxiety further.
* Poor sleep, mainly due to my kids waking up at night.
* Work stress, trying to raise the quality bar but facing pushback from leadership.
* Gained weight since becoming a dad, but my anxiety and low mood make it hard to stay active.

Because of all this, I’m now on my 4th week of 100mg Zoloft after being on 50mg for two years. Unfortunately, I’m still feeling sad, hopeless, fatigued, and low on motivation. I’ve also been dealing with physical symptoms like dizziness, palpitations, sweating, nausea, and indigestion. My sleep hasn’t improved either.

I know it can take up to 8 weeks for Zoloft to fully kick in, but I was hoping to feel better by now. I’ve seen my GP here in the UK but am considering going private to see a psychiatrist for more specialised care.

(My therapist asked me to tell the story I used the same text) I F32 have several doubts about my ex-boyfriend's M39 manners. By demanding responsibilities from him, could I have triggered narcissistic behaviour? ","My ex-boyfriend (he is in a autistic spectrum, maybe this information is relevant, given that the topic is behavior.) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting (given the context we used to see each other every day but without opportunities to talk) also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me,  (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies and the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend. 📌 There are more details that would be unfair for me not to point out: I had suggested we meet on Sunday, but he was tired from having done intense work the previous two days. He had also said he wouldn’t go out on Sunday, so he felt uncomfortable saying he was going out for coffee with a friend. At first, this is somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural to start telling the truth to your partner. And I never showed any kind of reaction that would disapprove of him having his moments with friends, btw.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
But I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times, and we had more arguments. Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn’t want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously. 

 I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me. (And which is also abuse)
In order to break this loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn’t want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn’t serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 
Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn’t leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? 

HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other  people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn’t work out because he had a “sexual hobby” that didn’t work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don’t want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It’s a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that’s the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""♥️"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she’s my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn’t talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it’s fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' 🤔)""
But my point wasn’t about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people. I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn’t work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.

 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn’t have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn’t necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (📌 On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn’t match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I’m talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but…) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn’t talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk. I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; he made assumptions that even after I responded, he didn’t believe, especially if it didn’t perfectly fit his understanding. He didn’t question me the way I questioned him. But maybe what he did was worse; he jumped to conclusions and acted based on that. He asked if my breast augmentation was done with the intention of working in pornography, for example. I said no, it was to improve my self-esteem, so I would feel good wearing a bikini (the bikini was just an example), but he replied, 'It doesn’t make sense for someone to get breast implants just to wear a bikini.' Well, in my country, people commonly do this for aesthetic reasons; it’s quite normal. But according to his world, where he might only know about porn actresses who do this, it makes sense for him to think in those terms.
This wasn’t serious, but he did something similar by giving up on our relationship without telling me anything after an argument. Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn’t get any response, even if neutral. It’s all very confusing.""
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way—nervous, sarcastic—and turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I’ll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn’t understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn’t allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 

He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn’t keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. 📌There we go: : we don’t live far from each other, there’s just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other’s homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.

There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of this guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits? Calling him unstable used to sound like an insult. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat due to insecurity/ego? 

He justifies the feelings I had for him and the fact that I insisted on him (according to his thinking, it didn’t make sense for me to be interested in someone like him,  given that the girls doesn't like him, according to what he said)  by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met (that wasn't a joke). I have already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don’t know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it’s worthy of a magazine article, lol

So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
But I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times, and we had more arguments. Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. 

I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn’t want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously. 

 I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me. (And which is also abuse)
In order to break this loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn’t want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn’t serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn’t leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other  people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn’t work out because he had a “sexual hobby” that didn’t work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. 

That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don’t want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. 

He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It’s a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that’s the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""♥️"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she’s my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn’t talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it’s fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' 🤔)""
But my point wasn’t about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people. I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn’t work out between us. 

The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.

 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn’t have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn’t necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (📌 On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn’t match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I’m talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but…) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn’t talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk. I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; he made assumptions that even after I responded, he didn’t believe, especially if it didn’t perfectly fit his understanding. He didn’t question me the way I questioned him. But maybe what he did was worse; he jumped to conclusions and acted based on that. He asked if my breast augmentation was done with the intention of working in pornography, for example. I said no, it was to improve my self-esteem, so I would feel good wearing a bikini (the bikini was just an example), but he replied, 'It doesn’t make sense for someone to get breast implants just to wear a bikini.' Well, in my country, people commonly do this for aesthetic reasons; it’s quite normal. But according to his world, where he might only know about porn actresses who do this, it makes sense for him to think in those terms.
This wasn’t serious, but he did something similar by giving up on our relationship without telling me anything after an argument. Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn’t get any response, even if neutral. It’s all very confusing.""
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way—nervous, sarcastic—and turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I’ll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn’t understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn’t allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 
He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn’t keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. 📌There we go: : we don’t live far from each other, there’s just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other’s homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of this guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits? Calling him unstable used to sound like an insult. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat due to insecurity/ego? 

He justifies the feelings I had for him and the fact that I insisted on him (according to his thinking, it didn’t make sense for me to be interested in someone like him,  given that the girls doesn't like him, according to what he said)  by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met (that wasn't a joke). I have already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don’t know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it’s worthy of a magazine article, lol

1fxtjlc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1fxtjlc/took_my_dad_to_paris_for_the_first_time_and/,Took my Dad to Paris for the first time and sharing some reflections on our trip,"Two months ago, I asked members here to provide some feedback on [our itinerary](https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1egmatm/my_60yearold_father_graduated_from_college_and/). We got back from Paris a few days ago and I wanted to thank all of you for your recommendations and wanted to provide some of our observations and advice. 

Hotel: We stayed at the[ Hotel Le Général](https://legeneralhotel.com/en/) and would definitely stay here again. We really liked the location of the hotel because it was within walking distance of Le Marais, and the hotel is located on a quiet street. There's two Metro stations within two blocks of the hotel. The rooms were cute and charming. Comfortable beds and room service left us a personalized greeting card with a care package of French candy and L'Occitane items. Staff were very friendly and helpful. 

Walking around to explore Paris: My dad loved nothing more than to put the itinerary aside and just explore the city by foot. If our feet got tired or we needed to use the bathroom, we always found a cafe and just have coffee or a small bite to eat. Or we found a bench, a bridge or paths along the Seine to take some rest and people watch. We easily got in 25,000+ steps every day so wear comfortable shoes! 

Currency: We used contactless payments for everything. We only used cash when we left the tip for hotel/room service and when we tipped our tour guides. 

Don't speak French? Don't worry! We learned a few basic phrases in French (""where's the bathroom?"" ""May I please buy a ticket,"" ""May we please get the check"") and always made sure to greet people with ""bonjour"" and the French people were very friendly and spoke English. No problems at all. 

The Metro: We only used the Metro to travel around or we walked. We're from NYC so the subway system in Paris was easy to navigate. Buying a Navigo pass using the kiosk was straight forward. We bought a package of 20 rides and by the end of the trip, I think we only had 3 trips left. My dad's Navigo card didn't work at one point (not sure what happened) but we went to speak to the ticket office and the guy told us not to worry and gave my dad a new card. Good signage everywhere and we used Google maps and CityMapper to get directions. And as New Yorkers, we really appreciated that the train platforms were clean, trains were never delayed, came frequently and some stations even had barriers to prevent people from falling onto the tracks. My dad kept saying how we really need these barriers at some of our train stations in NYC. I also learned very quickly that when the train is packed, people would get up from their seats if they sat next to the doors and stand to allow more room for passengers. We followed the same practice during rush hour.

Arc de Triomphe: We got tickets for a Tuesday, but when we arrived the ticket office said the monument was closed due to a ""social movement,"" which I assume means a protest? We were disappointed that we couldn't go the top, but what are you going to do? We made the best of it and used that time to explore the boulevards instead. My dad was very amused by how many Tik Tok/Instagram ""content creators"" there were. 

Eiffel Tower at night: We went on a Monday night at 9pm. Bought tickets online beforehand and the line waiting for the elevator wasn't too bad. Once we got to the top, it was not crowded at all! It was pretty cool to be at the top when the light show went on. You could hear the crowd on the ground cheer and clap. Around 10:30pm, Trocadero was very packed with people. Atmosphere was fun, but if you're anxious around a large crowd, I would avoid this area. 

Versailles: Got RER C tickets and we got there at 9am when the Palace opened. The tour of the King's Private Apartments was very good. We had a good laugh throughout the day observing all the TikTok/Instagram content creators in the Hall of Mirrors and at the surrounding gardens.  We had lunch reservations at [Ore](https://www.ducasse-chateauversailles.com/en/) and got a nice view of the entrance area. Food was good.

[Paris Walks tour](https://www.paris-walks.com/index_m.html): We booked two tours: the French Revolution and the Occupation and Liberation of Paris. Both tours were really great! Small groups with about 10-15 people, each tour was about 2 hours long.  Iris was our tour guide for the French Revolution. She's American, I think she's been living in Paris for 10+ years. Chris was our tour guide for the Occupation and Liberation of Paris. He's British, he's been living in Paris for 30 years. Both guides had a great sense of humor and gave us great insight on both historic periods. Next time I'm in Paris, I will book more tours with them. 

[Le Calife River Cruise for Dinner](https://calife.com/en/): This was a very touristy expensive thing to do, but no regrets! The staff were very friendly, service was excellent, drinks and the food were really good. And of course, cruising the Seine at night especially catching the Eiffel Tower sparkling was very fun and memorable. The table next to us were celebrating a birthday and everyone on the boat joined in to sing a loud ""happy birthday"" and clapped.

  
Notre Dame Cathedral: Coming here gave me mixed emotions. It brought back some good memories of going inside the cathedral 20 years ago and to see how much of Notre Dame was lost to the fire just made me sad. So much history gone forever. And for my Dad, this was his first time visting. On that day, I counted myself as one of the lucky ones to have visited Notre Dame before the fire. They have some stands in front of the cathedral where you can sit and watch the construction. It's truly remarkable how much the reconstruction has accomplished since the fire and we were really glad to learn that they hope to reopen Notre Dame this year. Also I forgot what a great neighborhood it is -- lots to do and see around Notre Dame! 

[Dinner at Benoit](https://www.benoit-paris.com/en/) and [lunch at Le Procope](https://www.procope.com/en/): We had dinner reservations at Benoit. Service was great and the food was really good. We loved the neighborhood it was in. I would come back here again to have dinner. On the same day that we booked the Paris Walks tour about the French Revolution, we had lunch at Le Procope, which our guide Iris spoke about on the tour. Service was fast and friendly and the food was just ok. 

Overall, it turns out my worries about bringing my 60 year old Dad to Paris for the first time were unfounded. Sure, he got tired from walking but like I mentioned above, we would find a cafe to enjoy some coffee, go to the Seine to sit or find a park bench. He found Paris to be utterly charming and wonderful. He really loved the bridges because there was always someone playing music, and he loved just taking in the view.

For too many, this grim reality defines their mental health journey, and no amount of standard SSRIs, therapy sessions, or mood-boosting apps seem to move the needle. Enter [**ketamine**](https://theinformer.uk/)—yes, that ketamine—the one you’ve heard of from party circuits, now donning a white coat and stepping into the clinical spotlight as a revolutionary treatment for depression. Let’s talk about its game-changing potential, and why it's got mental health professionals buzzing.

# The Elephant in the Room: What’s Treatment-Resistant Depression, Anyway?

First, let's set the stage. Depression is no one-size-fits-all disorder, but for [**treatment-resistant depression**](https://theinformer.uk/) (TRD), the bar is even higher. TRD is basically the ""boss level"" of depression: when traditional antidepressants don't work (we’re talking after multiple attempts, not just one), and your mood is still trapped in the basement, that’s TRD.

We’re talking about a condition where typical treatments—SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, etc.—all fail to provide substantial relief. For those stuck in this mental health Bermuda Triangle, the outlook can seem hopeless, which is exactly why ketamine nasal spray is such a monumental development.

# What Is Ketamine and How Did It Get Here?

For the uninitiated, [ketamine](https://theinformer.uk/p/ketamine-nasal-spray-the-new-hope) has been used in anaesthesia since the 1960s and became notorious as a club drug. But fast forward a few decades has become, and medical researchers have discovered its potent effects on the brain's glutamate system—essentially hitting the brain’s reset button. Ketamine offers rapid antidepressant effects, often working in hours rather than weeks, and that’s a big deal for people suffering from depression who feel like every day is a climb out of quicksand.

The FDA gave the green light for [**ketamine nasal spray**](https://theinformer.uk/p/ketamine-nasal-spray-the-new-hope) (Spravato, if you want to get formal) in 2019, and since then, it’s been making waves in the mental health community. Unlike its intravenous sibling, the nasal spray is a lot more accessible and less invasive, making it an easier option for patients and clinicians alike.

# How Does It Work? The Science Behind the Spray

Without diving too deep into neuroscience (you’re here to feel better, not to get a PhD), ketamine acts on [**NMDA receptors**](https://theinformer.uk/p/ketamine-nasal-spray-the-new-hope) in the brain. This system is involved in learning and memory, but more importantly, it’s a key player in mood regulation. Ketamine essentially rewires how neurons in your brain communicate, and that’s a huge boon for folks who have hit a wall with traditional treatments.

[**Standard antidepressants**](https://theinformer.uk/p/ketamine-nasal-spray-the-new-hope) usually work by increasing serotonin or dopamine, but ketamine's direct interaction with glutamate is a game-changer. It’s the difference between a slow-drip coffee and a triple espresso—you’ll feel it a lot quicker. Some patients report improvement in mood within **hours** of treatment. Compared to weeks or even months of waiting for conventional meds to work, that’s like switching from dial-up to fibre optics.

# The Fast Track: Rapid Relief in a Nasal Spray

The real kicker here? **Speed.** Traditional antidepressants require time—a lot of it—to work. You spend weeks titrating doses, wondering if today’s the day you’ll feel something other than numb. Ketamine spray breaks through that unbearable wait time. Administered in a clinical setting (yep, it’s doctor-supervised for your safety), the effects often kick in within hours. It’s not just a sprinkle of relief; for some, it’s a tsunami of emotional clarity.

But before you picture this as some magical, instantaneous cure, let’s reel it in slightly. While it’s fast, it’s not for everyone. This treatment works best for those with **treatment-resistant depression**, and the nasal spray is typically used alongside other medications. It’s not a solo hero—it’s part of a team.

# Is Ketamine the Future of Depression Treatment?

It’s tempting to crown ketamine as the new gold standard for depression treatment, but we’re not there yet. For one, ketamine treatment is still relatively expensive and not universally covered by insurance. Moreover, researchers are still studying the long-term effects, especially given ketamine’s notorious past as a recreational drug. For now, it's a powerful new tool in the psychiatric toolkit, offering hope where there was once despair.

But here's the question for you, dear reader: What if the answer to your treatment struggles was just a nasal spray away?

1fxtf23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1fxtf23/how_much_accommodation_is_too_much_accommodation/,How much accommodation is too much accommodation?,"One of my classes this semester is an online Accounting class. The exams are delivered virtually - take-home, online exams using Excel. I believe in this method of delivery because Excel skills are important for success in an Accounting career. This class is also a preparatory class for the CPA designation, and this method of exam delivery (ie. typed and not handwritten) mirrors their method of exam delivery.

This semester, I have a student in the class who, in my opinion, has received and/or is expecting excessive accommodation, and is being excessively demanding towards me (such as sending me what seem to be increasingly frustrated emails - like up to 4 in one day with subject lines in all caps, etc.)

Their accommodations include getting double the exam time and a request for a printed exam. I explained to their accessibility advisor that my class is an online class - I am not providing paper exams. The student is welcome to print the exam to make notes, etc. but they need to submit a typed exam for marking.

We had our first exam the other week, and this student called me partway through their 6 hour exam (the rest of the class had 3 hours) to say they started the exam in their office, but weren’t finished and needed to leave their office to go home. This was via voicemail so I’m unclear on whether or not they were asking for additional time. I called them back and said they are welcome to write the exam wherever they please, but if they chose to move to a different location, additional time would not be added to their exam. This isn’t a stop-and-start exam where you can start it in a coffee shop, go on a walk for an hour, and then expect me to tack on an additional hour because of your lack of time management. 

I’m also concerned that having double time is giving someone with issues over-thinking on an exam MORE time to over-think and spiral on a question, versus building quick thinking and analysis skills that will be expected in a professional designation program. 

I have escalated my concerns to their accessibility advisor, but am curious to hear from others on how you manage some of your higher-maintenance students?",17,1728255733.0,Professors,5,0.96,False

I’m a 30-year-old guy who loves discovering new music and sharing the occasional dad (di pa po ako tatay and I wish I was) joke. If you’re into binge-watching shows with sharp social commentary and enjoy meaningful conversations over coffee or kahit video chat (if we get to that point), we might just click! Looking for someone who’s ready to vibe over playlists, dive into spontaneous activities, and not take life too seriously. If that sounds like you, let’s connect and see where it leads. :)

Mutual Interest?

A long-term relationship, knows the respect behind compromising especially on lows and highs. At first we might spark and then eventually it will plateau, I guess diyan makikita kung para tayo sa isa't isa. Sorry, just had to set expectation para di tayo magsayang ng oras. If you've read all that, cheers, hmu!

We’re both bio majors, and get this—we’re basically twins. She doesn’t know it yet, but we’re going to be best friends forever. At first, everything was perfect! I told her about my super cool friends from back home (okay, so maybe I don’t technically know them yet, but there’s potential!) and how I’m such a party girl. I leave the dorm at night so she thinks I’m going out with friends, but I just walk around campus… socializing with squirrels. It’s all part of the illusion.

Anyway, I thought things were going great, but she’s been giving me weird vibes lately. Like, the other night, I was just trying to be helpful—her alarm didn’t even go off, but I was ready. I stood at the end of her bed to prevent the alarm from ringing. I know, thoughtful, right? She totally woke up and gave me that “Oh my god, thanks for being the best roommate ever” look. But when I told her I was just turning off her alarm, she seemed… off about it? Maybe she’s shy.

Now, about the gym thing. Okay, yes, I follow her around. I just want to make sure she’s doing everything right, you know? Spotting from a distance is totally a thing. She’s probably just flattered that someone admires her workout routine so much. Honestly, I feel like she’s giving me main character energy and I’m just her mysterious sidekick.

But lately, she’s been acting distant, and I’m kind of worried she’s not getting how much I care about our friendship. Should I bring her flowers? Or maybe I could stand at the foot of her bed again, but this time with coffee. Yeah, that’ll win her over. Wish me luck!",23,1728255694.0,UCI,10,0.79,False
