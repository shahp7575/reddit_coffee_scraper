Friendships are like plants 🌱, so the saying goes. They need water 💧 or they wilt and die. Well... friendships (I mean people, in general) require a bit more than that! Haha.

My interests are wide and varied.

I'm open to any and all genders- LGBTQ+ friendly. Please reach out, I don't bite, but my cat does! I'm down for some pen pals online (they can be short reddit convos, Discord calls, or your favorite app) or gaming or watching something together (especially if you enjoy quipping MST3K style). If you're Sacramento based, I'd be down to meetcha. Maybe board games or some kayaking- I'd love to kayak together- or just chill conversations over coffee?

I’m just tired of seeing models selling content or their time for cents on the dollar. 🥲 Like you don’t see specialty coffee shops reduce their $8 latte rate just because McDonalds also sells coffee for $1. You know? We’re not saving lives over here and I feel like it’s harder than ever for clients to take us seriously/not try to scam us when we’re out here reducing our prices cuz it’ll generate more volume. But like at what cost?

I understand why, but then it makes clients feel like a $2 foot pic is normal and someone who’s selling feet pics for $10 is too much. But like, guys, it’s feet. It’s sex. It’s for FUN. It’s for PLEASURE. It’s not a NECESSITY. 

It’s also our own bodies and that’s why they’re coming to us for it. If they wanted free porn, they know where to find it.

Our customers are coming to us because they want TO PAY for their fetish, fantasy and whatever. So like can we please collectively value our work/bodies/content/talent a little more and raise our prices? 

I’m sure every person on here is gorgeous and WORTHY of every cent you receive. But honestly, we should be receiving more. 💁‍♀️

1ls01yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ls01yb/aitah_for_abandoning_my_friend/,AITAH for abandoning my friend?,"As a solo traveler, i (46F)was going to pay the double rate regardless so I invited a close friend (48F) to come with me to Madagascar. All she had to do was pay her flight to Tana, money for souvenirs and the rest of the trip was covered. We arrived late on Monday and were scheduled to fly the next morning on a charter flight that only operates once weekly to a remote location in the north. Tuesday to go, Saturday morning to return. Then the plan was to spend Saturday and Sunday in the capital before heading south for 3 days. I woke us up 45 minutes before the car was scheduled to take us to the airport. For some reason, she had, the night prior, decided to completely unpack and reorganize her luggage. (shrug emoji).

I'm pretty low maintenance, 15 minutes to shower, brush my teeth and hair and then good to go. I walked to the lobby and was giddy over my morning coffee. I was in freakin' Madagascar, the top of my bucket list wish trips and heading to Tsingy de Namoroka national park. Squee!

About 10 minutes before we were scheduled to leave, I went back to the room where my friend was rushing around trying to get things together. I asked if I could help and she snapped at me that I was just distracting her.

Finally, we made it down to the waiting car and were on our way about 15 minutes late. We got to the airport. We were restricted to one 20kg bag and so the luggage was minimal. As we were about to board the flight, my friend realized that she left her zoom camera lens at the hotel. I told her that we would be staying at the same hotel when we returned and she could get it then but she didn't want to go on this leg without it so she took a taxi back to get it despite my concern that she didn't have time.

Well, she missed the flight and i decided to go without her. This was a once in a lifetime trip for me and i had saved YEARS (26k USD) to go. I would never have another opportunity.

When I returned to Tana, we met up again and I found out that she spent the last 4 nights sleeping at the airport because she didn't want to spend money on a hotel because ""you told me that you'd cover all that"".

Long story short, the rest of our trip was miserable. She was resentful that I abandoned her and sucked the enjoyment out the rest of our time in Anosy and Tana.

Now that we've returned, our friend group has sided with her and told me that it was outrageous that i left without her and that i should have stayed so that we could be together. I tried to explain that i had told her that she didn't have time to return to the hotel and that i had already paid for the flights and the camp that we were staying at. If i had stayed it would have cost me hundreds of dollars for new lodging AND i would have missed half of my planned trip experience.

I have become a pariah in our friend group. They all tell me that I was selfish and placed my friend in danger by abandoning her in a foreign country.

I know that everyone loves this and definitely reads this paragraph :D I started writing this script because I couldn't really find anything like it. Who knows, maybe I just didn't look hard enough. However, this scripts is based off of me, so I hopefully my personality and little quirks can resonate with some people. I never really see people play around with the needy person providing comfort, and it was a bit of a challenge to try and bring it to life. This is also my first script that I've written in a while, so hopefully I didn't do too bad. 

Rules - If you use this script, please credit my Youtube, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/@BoyfriendGooseASMR). Any modifications are completely fine. If you do decide to fill this, please comment your fill. I wanna see my creation come to life heheh >:) Posting on Youtube, Patreon, etc. is fine as long I have access to fills somehow.

Author notes - I wanted to do something that wasn't typically what you would see me do. I tried stepping a bit outside of my comfort zone, and I'd like to think that I did okay. Originally, it was going to be a VA speaker, but people in my community seem to have a thing for gamer boys (lucky me :D). If I ever got mad at a girlfriend, I would be doing everything in my power to apologize. This is a (pretty heavily) watered down version of that. I am a golden retriever, thank you very much. Thank you to both Rin and Lyu for helping me with ideas for the ending. Very cool :D

Listener summary - You just got home, and you find your \[boyfriend/girlfriend/SO\] playing some ranked games on \[Valorant, any other shooter\], and not in bed with you? What a crime! They'll have to win back your heart before (and after) you forgive them.

Speaker summary - You get home before your SO and hop on some sort of PVP game (in my mind it's Valorant but it can really be anything), and get a bit mad at them for interrupting your ranked match. Feeling horrible, you abandon mid-game and calm them down until you both fall asleep.

\----

(listener walks in on speaker playing video games) \[Angry, yelling if you want\] No, he's on the right! Jesus, are you deaf? Please, for the love of God, listen to your teammates' comms. Jesus!



\[Still a bit of anger leftover in your voice, slowly fades out\] Oh, hey baby, what's up?



Yeah, I'm just playing a few games, and then I'll join you in bed. Is that alright?



\[Concerned\] ...Baby? Why aren't you saying anything?



Did something happen at work? What's going on?



If nothing happened, then why aren't you talking to me? Did I do something wrong?



\[Tired of clinginess\] Yeah? What did I do wrong?



All I wanted to do was play a few games. I just got home from work, and I want to take a break.



I hang out with you all the time as soon as I get home. Surely not hanging out with you for one day doesn't mean that much. We always have tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that...



\[Kinda fed up\] Listen, I will get to bed in a second. I'm in the middle of my rank up game, and I don't need you in my ear right now.



(listener starts crying/gets upset)



\[Back to worried\] Okay, you know that's not what I meant... Baby, no, where are you going? (optional footsteps as they leave the room)



(to teammates, slight pause in between each line) Alright, I'm gonna go. No, I don't care. There's a more important matter on my hands right now, so just, give me a second. I'm not fucking asking, give me a second, okay?



(back to listener) Baby? Are you in here?



Are you under the covers?



Well, I'm pretty sure that blankets can't talk on their own. (sits on bed beside them)



\[Soft voice for basically the rest of the script\] Listen, I get that you're angry, and you have every right to be mad at me right now, but I want to talk to you. It doesn't mean that you have to talk back, just listen for a little while, okay?



Listen, I'm sorry for what I said back there. You know I didn't mean it, right? I love your voice. I love getting to hang out with you. I love coming home and spending time with you after a long day.



Recently, I've been under a lot of pressure from work. Supporting both of us meant that I started picking up extra shifts at work, and they just keep increasing my workload. I didn't want to tell you because I knew you'd worry, and I didn't want to stress you out.



No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one who should be sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you like that. It was rude and you didn't do anything wrong.



No, I don't count that. If you're in the habit of hanging out with me right as I get back from work, then it'd be only fair to think I'd do the same today too.



I'm sorry, baby. I really am. I know how needy you are, and I love that about you. God, I wouldn't know what to do if you thought that I was too clingy. But, I don't think I've been doing the best when it comes to meeting your needs, hmm?



So, I've got an idea. You and me, right now. For the rest of the night, we do whatever you want. 



What ranked game? I quit. Sure, my team might be a bit mad at me, but I'd much rather them be mad at me than you. 



My rank? Who cares? I have you, and that's better than any rank I could ever achieve. 



Yes, I mean it. You're like, a power up. There's no way I would be able to take on this much work if I didn't have you waiting at home for me. 



Now that I've poured out my heart to you, do you think that you could find it in yours to forgive me? You know just as well as I do that neither of us can sleep properly without the other at this point.



(They come out from underneath the blanket)



I knew that there was something under those covers. It turns out, it was the prettiest person I've ever seen.



So, what do you want to do, now that you've returned from the blanket dimension? 



Cuddles? Yeah? Come on, I know you want to. Come nuzzle into my chest, baby.



No, I like it. It's a reminder of you whenever I have to travel for work. Sleeping on call with you can hold me over, but it's not nearly as good as the real thing.



You know something? What I regret saying the most right now? That I didn't want to hear your voice. Do you know how much I love your voice? God, I could listen to you all day. Do you know how many times I've thought of calling off of work just to listen to you talk? I love when I finally get home and I'm able to hear you talk about what you did that day, how you're doing, or literally anything else. And don't think for a second that you don't have a nice voice, because that is an absolute lie. I know how you think, baby.



And your hair. I know I didn't say anything about it, but, like, how could I? It always looks amazing, no matter what. I've seen you intentionally try and make it look bad and fail. The way that it flows so perfectly. It always smells like you just washed it too, and I have no clue how you do that.



And your eyes. They're literally endless. I space out in the middle of the conversations because I can't pull myself away from them. The way that you can pull me by doing literally nothing should honestly be studied.



And your personality, too. The way that you care so deeply for me, and always find some way to make me feel better. The amount of times you've lifted me to heights I never knew I could reach are countless, and I have you to thank for every single time.



And just how pretty you look. Every time I look at you, I feel like I'm dating a supermodel.



I love you, you know that? More than bees love pollen, more than Peter Parker loves Mary Jane, more than anything else in the world. I love you so, so much, and I'm so sorry that I don't tell you that enough. I really should tell you that more, huh? I just hope that my actions can sponge up some of my inactivity.



Uh, don't try hide to hide it. I can see you giggling. 



So... I almost forgiven? 



Still not talking to me, huh? Either way, I just want you to know that I meant everything I said. I wasn't saying them just so you wouldn't be mad at me anymore. I love you, you know that? I don't want you staying mad at me forever. 



At least I can finally see your smile, and that's all I need. For now, I'll probably need you to cuddle me like for the rest of the night.



Buttttt, I still think I should apologize even more, so I'm going to clear my schedule for tomorrow, we're going to do anything you want to do. For the whole day. How does that sound?



Good? Good. Do you have anything in mind?



Yep, anything you say. We can go to those places, and then maybe stop for coffee and a few snack in between.



God, you're so excited. I love it when you talk so much.



I promise, we'll do everything.



But, for now, let's try to get some rest, okay? Neither of had the best day, but that's alright. We always have tomorrow, and we need rest to do all things you've planned for us.



Good night. I love you, forever and always.",2,1751684303.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False

Since it is a percentage based discount if I load more obviously I get a bigger discount. I drink one latte every morning and buying in bulk (in this case 360 pods will last me probably 1 year and a half maybe even 2)

This has to be worth it right???? After subtracting the cost of the nespresso vertuo plus machine from the order total (381 - 68$ \[assuming tax\] = 313 --> 313/360 = 86 or 87) 

So 87 cents per vertuo DE pod as opposed to the 1.35 cents per pod. Or by 26$ per 30 count!

This deal ends july 6th, it'll probably come back sooner or later....?

I want to share something that might be one of the first real-world consumer rights cases being driven with ChatGPT’s help — and we’re just getting started.

A few days ago, I paid for a 3-month subscription to the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel. Almost immediately after the payment went through, my account was permanently banned without warning or explanation. Support refused to provide any details, denied a refund, and referenced vague “Terms of Service” violations.

It felt like a scam — and I was about to give up.

But then I turned to ChatGPT for help. What followed surprised me:

	•	It helped me write a formal refund request and appeal letter
	•	Walked me through my legal rights under the Digital Services Act (I’m currently in the EU)
	•	Helped me draft strategic Reddit replies to find others who experienced the same
	•	Showed me how to preserve evidence, deal with subreddit mod abuse
	•	Most importantly: it gave me the clarity, structure, and emotional support to stay focused and fight back with professionalism

We’re now gathering more victims, documenting evidence, and preparing to escalate together. If this leads to a refund, public accountability, or even legal action — this might be the first consumer case empowered and coordinated by ChatGPT in the wild.

It’s not just ChatGPT helping me — it’s us, using tools like this to push back when companies cross the line.

If you’re reading this and feel like a platform has wronged you — don’t stay silent. Use the tools you have. Organize. Document. Ask for help.

And to CMB or any other platform watching — we’re not afraid, and we’re not alone anymore.

Thanks for reading. I’ll keep you updated on what happens next.

1lrzv5a,https://i.redd.it/sr0k1u38zyaf1.jpeg,Summary - Moomin (1969) Episode 17-18,"Episode 17: Where is a Baby?

Moominpappa was scolded by Moominmamma for lying down and drinking coffee in bed. She then pointed out that Moomin now was copying him. Seeing their parents looking at him, Moomin accidentally spilled his coffee on his bed sheet. Moomin was embarrassed that now his sheet had to be hung dried outside with a big brown stain. He now guarded the sheet and would explain to anyone passing by that the stain was in fact coffee. Mr. Muskrat walked passed as Moomin went in to explain himself, but Mr. Muskrat could not care less. Distracted, Little My got a hold of the sheet and took it away. She threatened to tell Snorkmaiden about it unless he got her a baby sister. Unsure of how to get a baby for her, he talked to Sniff where he mentioned about a myth of a stork delivering a baby. Moomin went out on a hill to catch a stork but was made fun of by Snork and Snorkmaiden. Humiliated, Snorkmaiden came to comfort and told him about the wishing lake. Moomin later traveled to the lake in the forest. He wished for a baby and offered a bottle cap in return. He soon found a crying baby in a stroller nearby. Thinking that the wish had come true, he took the baby back to Little My. She was pleased and now nursed the baby like her own. Moomin walked out happy and then discussed about the wishing lake with Snorkmaiden, they found Little My taking the baby in a stroller but she changed the direction upon seeing the two for she wished to not be disturbed. While asking about the baby, Little My accidentally led go of the stroller and it rolled down hill, Moomin saved the baby in the nick of time. In a meantime, Moominpappa came across a crying mother who had her baby kidnapped so he took her to the police station. The mother notified that she found a strange backpack left near the lake, that backpack turned out to belong to Moominpappa. Later in the day, Moomin and Snorkmaiden fantasized about them having babies as well so they went to the lake and wished for them yet nothing happened. Moominpappa, the mother and the inspector came to the lake and apprehended them.

They all went to Mymble's house to confront Little My. The baby now cried and wanted to go back to the real mother. For some time, Little My refused to give up the baby but eventually returned the baby to the rightful mother. At night, she hugged her doll longingly and broke down. It was that she always wanted a younger sister to play with. Moomin asked Snufkin of what to do as he felt bad for Little My. The next day, Moomin pretended to be a baby on a stroller for Little My. Snork who drove passed them was disgusted by Moomin's action pretending to be a big baby and drove off. Little My then left and walked Moomin through the hill path.

Episode 18: I Want to Become a Beggar / I Already Got Tired of the Rich Person

A plane was seen flying above Moominvalley causing a lot of noise pollution to the villagers. Moomin and Little My followed the plane and investigate. The plane later airdropped wooden crates and then a man parachuted down into the forest. The villagers leaded by Snork, Sniff, Mymble, Mr. Hemulen, the Inspector and Mr. Muskrat also came to investigate and found lots of gold coins in the crates, they then suspected that it might be a smuggling operation. Moomin and Little My found the man as he then asked them a series of questions. He then gave away his gold coins for those who answered him correctly. Moomin brought home the coins and were scolded by his parents. Moominpappa went out to confront the man but he also attempted to give Moominpappa gold as well. The man then followed Moomin and Moominpappa home and then revealed that he was a self-made successful business man.

In the past, he was an orphan living off the street, he worked as a shoe-shiner to earn a living. As time passed, he worked hard and eventually became a successful person. Now, he got tired and wanted to start his life anew once again and that was the reason why he was giving his wealth away. Moomin then helped him giving away the gold coins but no one in Moominvalley wanted them. They went to Snork as he also found out who the man was, he was a cut-throat business man who came to Moominvalley with a malicious intent for no one in the right mind would give their wealth away for free and not wanting anything in return. Not wanting to associate with them, he dragged Snorkmaiden into the house. Later, Snorkmaiden broke out and suggested Moomin and the Business Man to do some fair exchange instead of giving the rich away. Moomin and the Business Man then went around exchanging some broken junks from the villagers. Successfully giving away the gold, they spotted a plane airdropping more gold crates. It was Snork who ruined their plan by contacting the company for him.

Moomin went back to confront Snork but the Business Man soon realized that there were a lots of people who depended on him back in his company. He then decided to return and not bothered the people in Moominvalley anymore. Moomin shook hand with him and waved goodbye as his helicopter picked him up and flew away.

Translator Note

\- In this version, Little My seems to have no siblings rather than the Mymble whom likely did not spend enough time with her. It's an odd contrast for the Mymble family in other version to have abundant of children. Also Little My in v1990 seems to hate children more than she likes them, a big interesting contrast.

\- Despite Mymble not being around for Little My in this episode, she is often seen being around in this version a lot more than any other version as well.

\- Episode 18 is a mirrored episode of v1990 Episode 27: Aunt Jane.

\- The Business Man was likely to live in London, England.

\- There a scene of Sniff confronted Moomin and the Man trying giving coins away but he never asked for any himself. He could have taken it all if it was him for another version.

I’m 31, currently wrapping up a role as a National Account Manager in the food and drink industry in the UK. I’ve got two job offers on the table, both with solid potential, but in very different ways, and I’m torn.



Option 1: Head of Wholesale at a fast-growing, values-led drinks brand
	•	£60k base salary (+ £6k “car allowance,” not tied to owning a vehicle but will have to bused for any train ticket or car rental)
	•	15% annual bonus (non-performance linked)
	•	It’s a big step up in scope and seniority, I’d be owning wholesale nationally
	•	The company’s founder and team have been incredibly supportive and emotionally intelligent throughout the process, they’ve reassured me about the learning curve, and they genuinely seem invested in my long-term growth (talk of becoming a Director/shareholder eventually)
	•	That said, the product category is entirely new to me. I’d be learning from scratch, stretching beyond my current expertise
	•	It excites me, but I’m scared it could be too big a leap and that I might not be ready

Option 2: Senior National Account Manager at a well-established coffee-related brand
	•	£65k base salary
	•	Uncapped quarterly bonuses tied to performance
	•	I know this space well, I’ve been in coffee for years, I have strong contacts, and I’d be able to deliver results early
	•	More financially rewarding in the short term and with way less of a learning curve
	•	Feels emotionally “safer,” solid, steady growth in a space I know
	•	But potentially less long-term upside in terms of career acceleration

One role is in my comfort zone. The other is outside of it.

Both teams seem genuinely great. The first is more forward-thinking, mission-driven, and invested in personal development. The second is proven, structured, and more performance-based in terms of rewards.

Extra context: I eventually want to run my own business or acquire small businesses to grow and run myself. I’m trying to figure out which role would better support that vision, in terms of learning, positioning, headspace, and financial runway.


Has anyone here faced a similar choice? Or moved out of their niche and into a new category successfully?

Would really appreciate your thoughts/tips/suggestions! Thanks! ",1,1751683615.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

I was never popular in school at all, I was always an outcast as I was shy, didn’t live in the right area or was seen as weird by them. Anyway this came with constant bullying which was extremely damaging to my self esteem. I also realised I was bi and was mocked constantly for this. I feel I never had the typical fun experience as nothing happened apart from bullying, damage to my self esteem and toxic friends. I was lonely, so I befriended a girl who my mum knew her mum and she was very toxic. My mum was genuinely nice at home and would help the best she could, my dad however could be quiet nasty when he wanted to be or said things that he didn’t mean, which caused lasting damage. She would be love bombing me to then turn on me and bash me like I was worthless. During the time, I went very emo (still am) and had a love for English literature, I still do and wanted to be a writer.

I left school and went to college (16-18 years old in the UK). I took the wrong subjects and made a mess of college. I guess I felt I should go with what seemed easy instead of what I was good at, which led to no interest in the subjects and me dropping out or getting bad grades. My friend ( the toxic one ) she like abused me badly even more as we got older, she got into legal trouble and it got to the point I had to cut her off. Some of my other friends were slightly scared of her and therefore joined her, so I was left with no friends. I had a few decent friends from other courses or other things I did but they was very surface level and didn’t last past college. At this time, I had came out to my mum as bisexual and whilst she reacted good, I couldn’t stop doubting due to comments she made in the past and constantly replayed this in my head to the point I would argue with her or have mini cry spells over it. 

The summer after I left college with poor grades apart from one subject. I have super bad moral OCD( I always had OCD but this was scary). I ended up meeting a guy who was toxic but gave me attention. I started an NSFW account online for money/attention, I even nearly became a stripper ( so not me) andI would drink constantly, party till early hours in the morning and then he would like try and do stuff, I clearly was not read for. I ended up breaking it off but this caused a massive division and I lost any other new friends I made. 


When I was 19, I realised that I had enough and decided to apply for University with an extra year to get onto my course. I chosen English literature before deciding it wasn’t my field, but I would love to be a writer. Anyway I joined University and seemed to improve mentally a lot, I lived at home and would commute and had made some new friends and had a very good year. I remember thinking I feel so much better now and my OCD was present but had calmed down. 

Anyway I moved into accommodation for my 1st official year of University, I did Psychology and Sociology (which I love) and I was so happy. However, I met a girl on freshers week who befriended me and was just like my old toxic friend, I guess she sensed I was shy and wanted someone to abuse. This brought back PTSD from my previous toxic friend and I sank into a hole. My OCD turned into harm OCD and I had a mini breakdown and had to go home constantly and even my parents were concerned and confused. I had this toxic situationship at the time with a guy who would put me down, compare me to other people constantly and was a complete nightmare. I stayed longer than I should and it damaged me. I ended up coming home, feeling like a failure but went anyway. I did a year workload in like 2 months and passed somehow. I had made a new friend online and she seemed super nice, we spent the whole summer together. 

I feel I repaired my mental health over the summer as being away from that environment helped. I went back to Uni for 2nd year (I stayed home for accommodation) and I got invited to freshers with the girl I had befriended in the summer. Anyway I stayed at hers for freshers and her male friend walked me home as she wanted to stay in the club. I trusted him as she did. He knew I was drunk and started hugging me, I was like so uncomfortable and then he followed me up to her room and started kissing me and fingering me. I was so drunk and kind of scared, I didn’t do anything and went along with it. He started doing more sex acts and made me do stuff to him, luckily we didn’t have intercourse but only because he heard a flatmate come through the door. I told my friend and she said to report him for SA to the university. I did this and she came with me and I had to tell the whole story again (I was so embarrassed) the uni said they would sort it and well they didn’t and just laughed it off and took his side. The same friend then turned on me as apparently she had a crush on him and I had stole him from her point of view. I was too ashamed and embarrassed to tell anyway close to me and didn’t want the trauma of police involved. 

I went through a really weird time afterwards. I would book trips alone or meet people in cities offline to try and keep my mind active. I ended up getting spiked by one of these online friends and nearly SA again. I started not doing any work and just keeping myself distracted. I went on dates and would dump decent guys once they started discussing sex as sex made me wanna puke.

I had good and bad days for the next 6 months and my OCD has got worse and worse. I reconnected with an old friend who moved near by. This friend is addicted to drugs and just has orgies/ drug parties. I have been to a few and I only took weed, but I am tempted to try more to feel something. I know they aren’t the best friends but they accept me and make me feel wanted.

Anyway the last few months have been awful and I feel I am slowly slipping into how low I used to feel. My harm OCD is scary and constantly attacking my thoughts, my Uni work isn’t as good as it could be. I feel with my mental health and how this affects my performance that I will end up not doing good enough and failing University or not getting the grades I need for my dream masters at Durham University. I have had a few rejections at Jobs for being shy and quiet, which has made me hate myself. I feel I could be an academic, with a stable partner, drinking expensive coffee and maturing, but I can’t be independent or live alone as I have extreme OCD, miss days of Jobs/Uni and feel so lonely unless I get attention in toxic ways. My parents clearly want me to be independent and this causes arguments at home, which trigger my OCD off. 

I don’t want to die but I have constant days where I message an online friend who understands and explain how low I feel or points where I feel I want to check myself into a mental hospital. 

I feel I could be this way at 16, but now I look like a loser and are ruining chances I could have of being successful. I feel this battle with never end. Also I feel I am way more intelligent in the right zone, but I have struggled so much with mental health that just basic survival is hard for me.

Am I wrong for being pissed about it?","[context]
Over a year ago, I had escaped my abusive father, and I have been trying to rebuild my life ever since.
I live with my mother, I'm currently waiting for my SSDI to be approved so I can have income(there's no place for me to work where I live, and I have autism).
I've been wanting to become more mature for a long time, and I thought my mother would start letting me handle things on my own.
The only thing she lets me do is aside from chores, is letting me go outside on the porch, and if I say something to her, going to my local coffee shop and the gas station.
She won't let me prove my maturity.
I keep seeing other people my age, even younger, being allowed to handle themselves; going places themselves, able to exist without a parent breathing down their necks, being allowed to have independence as great as a freakin' 22 year-old's!
I'm actively being held back from that; I can't go more than a mile away from my apartment, hell not even an MILLIONTH of a mile. I'm not allowed to go anywhere else without her breathing down my neck and constantly bothering me in public places, nor does she even allow me do anything that I actually want to do OTHER than just staying up in my room.
When I try to bring it up to her, she gets hostile and starts making up excuses, and when I try to argue against it, she calls me ""immature, spoiled, 'I let you do what you,'"" even going as far as to threaten me with stealing my things, cutting off my only way of getting any cash(until my SSDI comes), and shit like forcing me out of my room(where I can have actual privacy) and comparing me to my abuser.
I can't figure out any way to get this through her damn head. Even other people have been making excuses for her, and I'm REALLY pissed and stressed out.

My husband [36M] and I [32F] have been together 6 years, and I think he hates me.","Okay, please bear with me.  This is probably going to get long, and I'm 100% open to whatever advice and opinions you all have to offer.  But I'm also just hoping to get this all down in one place so I can try to organize my thoughts.

My husband and I have been together 6 years.  We have a 2yo together and a 10yo from his previous marriage.  A year ago we bought an old farm property with the plan to tear down the old farmhouse and rebuild a custom home on the property.  We build custom homes for a living, so we knew what we were getting into (I thought).  My role in the business is design and project management.  My husband has stepped back from day-to-day operations and is focused on building our house and maintaining/repairing the farm and it's buildings.  Our 2yo is home full time as we try to manage all of this, and I am responsible for 99% of the childcare for both kids.

My husband is incredibly particular when it comes to standards of work.  He's well known for making licensed carpenters redo work that's entirely proper but doesn't look perfect, just because they have a piece of house wrap upside down or some functional-but-ugly rough framing.  In building our house, he's turned down help from our employees because he just ends up redoing most of what they've done anyway.  And to be clear, their work fully exceeds all code and best practice requirements, he's just so determined that this house needs to be done right that he cannot bring himself to accept anything less than absolute perfection.

So instead of having our licensed and experienced carpenters work with him, he's resorted to having me and my family help him on weekends.  And (to no one's surprise) we don't exactly meet his expectations either.  I can draft you a detail showing exactly how to build every aspect of the house, but I cannot operate the tools with the precision required to execute those details to his standard.  My dad is more than happy to show up and help in whatever way he can, but again doesn't have the skill to meet my husband's expectations.  My husband has gotten to a point where he's so burnt out and frustrated that he's just angry with everyone all the time.  The kids and I walk on eggshells because no one really knows when he's going to explode next.  He can't figure out why our toddler wants nothing to do with him 90% of the time, but it's entirely because she doesn't know what to expect from him.  In the ""before"" he was the most patient and loving Dad, and both kids absolutely adored him.  I was like chopped liver if he was in the room.  Now, they'll go to him if I'm physically unavailable but otherwise all of the parenting falls to me.

To add to all of that, when we first bought the place he thought it would be a good idea to build my parents a second dwelling on the property.  It's allowed under our local rules, and would work out well for all of us from a financial perspective.  It also gets them closer to us for childcare now and support for them as they age.  My parents aren't tidy people who meticulously maintain things (quite the opposite) and that was a concern I've had from the beginning, but originally he thought it wouldn't be a big deal because we'd just maintain things for them as part of the rental agreement.  But he's now so angry about everything that he doesn't want them here at all.  Except my parents sold their house this summer to take advantage of the housing market peak and are now renting while they wait for us to build their house.  So backing out of that isnt really a great option.

And, as a result of all of this, our sex life has all but died.  It's kind of hard to let myself be vulnerable to the person who seems repulsed by my existence, so I guess it's my fault that the bedroom is dying?  I'm not sure, but he seems to feel pretty strongly that it's my problem to fix.  Actually, it's all my problem to fix.

So.  He works hard, I don't dispute that.  I know he's under a lot of stress, and I know I don't have the ability to alleviate that stress.  If I could execute *anything* relating to the house (or anything else) to a standard he'd be happy with, I'd do it in a heartbeat.  But I can guarantee that anything I touch is going to be considered unacceptable, so it's not worth getting involved.

He waffles between wanting me to figure out how to back out of the second dwelling thing and agreeing that it's logically still the best thing for everyone in the long run.  He recognizes that I can't back out of that without destroying my relationship with my parents, and I'm concerned that even if I did blow up that relationship, it probably wouldn't fix all of the issues we're having.

Prior to buying the property and embarking on this whole project, things were good.  We had the typical disputes about chores and communication, but nothing that couldn't be resolved over a coffee during naptime.  I had hope that the issues we're currently having would get better once the house building stress was out of the picture, but I'm getting worried that our marriage isn't going to last long enough to see that point.

So I'm open to absolutely any advice you have to offer.  If cancelling my parents build at all costs is the best move, I'll figure out how to do that.

Tl;Dr: Building a house and my husband is angry and resentful because no one can meet his (incredibly high) standards except himself.  It's impacting everything from our parenting to our sex life, and I'm not sure what to do.

ETA:  Therapy is a no go.  I know it's the right answer and probably what we need, but he absolutely refuses.  I'll bring it up with him again, but he did it with his first wife and it didn't work so he's basically written it off.  One of the most important factors in therapy is choosing to be there and buying into the process, so unless he's on board I don't think it'll get us anywhere.

And I know I can Google but I've seen some really egregious dumps in the past abuse google analytics with bot reviews and paying to get legitimate complaints removed, so I'd rather ask real people.  ",2,1751682390.0,Parkersburg,2,1.0,False

We were Grade 12 senior high school classmates. I started becoming interested in her on February 14. I had a classmate make a self-crocheted keychain that I planned to anonymously give to her on Valentine’s Day. I didn’t want her to know it was from me.

When she received it, she used it and hung it on her bag. I was lowkey happy seeing her use it.

Then March came — that’s when everything started. We became mutual. We got grouped together for an event group work that lasted from the 1st to 2nd week of March. That gave me the chance to talk to her every day. I showed my intentions clearly.

Our prom was in the last week of March. I really tried to win her over before prom so I could dance with her. I prepared a gift for her and included a quote — the same one from the keychain. We danced. Things went well.

Graduation was the 2nd week of April. On graduation day, I introduced her to my mother. My mom even took pictures of us. We were hopeful about our future together because we were going to the same city for college, far from our hometown.

I arrived in that city around the 3rd week of April to look for scholarships. I didn’t find any. She followed in the last week of April for a one-week stay, just to take an entrance exam at the university she already planned to attend.

On her 2nd day there, she invited me on a date — with her mother. It was hard to find a way to go because my boarding house was far from the city center, but I made it work. We spent time together from around 12pm to 5pm, since someone had to pick me up and it wasn’t easy to commute. On the 3rd day, she invited me again, but I struggled to get permission and a ride. I was late, but we still bonded while ice skating. After that, we sat and reflected with her mom. I asked her mother’s permission if I could court her daughter. Her mom was happy and said it was good that I asked her first.

Same time again — I had to leave at 5pm because I rode with someone heading home.

On the 4th day, she had her exam. On the 5th, she returned to our hometown.

I stayed in the new city and did everything I could to convince my aunt (who would fund my studies) to let me study at the same university as her. I told my aunt before when she was asking who's inviting me to hang out and go ice skating that she was my classmate before, that she was studying there too. But the truth is, I really wanted to study there not just because of her. That university aligned with my dreams of taking BS Psychology, and I felt it was the right environment for me, it was also just a bonus that my course is on the same campus of the university as hers.

However, my aunt didn’t agree. She believed gossip that students from that university were being forced into activism. She didn’t want me to go there. I kept convincing her, but it reached a point where she got bothered and called my mom. My mom scolded me and said I should be thankful someone is willing to send me to school and not be picky. They both assumed that the only reason I wanted to study there was because of her.

Because of that, I stopped pushing. I was worried they’d turn against our relationship. I couldn’t even do video calls with her anymore because my aunt would assume she was manipulating me. But we kept sending each other voice messages. May was a happy month for us.

By the 3rd week of May, I returned to our hometown. Our interaction became purely through messages. On the 4th week of May, she went back to the city to get her uniform and school ID. The day before her flight, I invited her on a simple ice cream date. I wasn’t used to going out and I was cautious about spending, but I wanted to see her. We had fun. She stayed less than a week and returned before June.

We were still doing well in the first week of June. We constantly chatted, but I couldn’t video call because I didn’t have my own room, and my home was more toxic than my aunt’s house. I often opened up to her about my problems at home.

By the last day of June, she told me I was changing — that I wasn’t consistent anymore. She feared that I only put in effort before because I was chasing her. Now that I ""had"" her, she felt like I stopped trying.

We had a calm chat. I reassured her. I explained my situation honestly and told her my intentions were real. I told her I had plans for us, and I wanted to give her a future that wasn’t full of struggle. I hadn’t asked her yet if I could formally court her because I was saving that for when we were together again in the city, because I wanted it to be consistent.

We ended the conversation on a good note — or so I thought.

The next day, she became cold and dry. Her replies were short and delayed. I asked her daily if she was okay. She always said yes, but I could feel something was off.

At the same time, I was busy looking for a university very close to hers so I could fulfill my original plan, to finally take another step for us. I worked hard to convince my aunt — and I finally succeeded. I told her excitedly, but she didn’t seem interested anymore.

Three days later, I asked her, “Are you still okay with me?” That’s when she admitted she wasn’t sure anymore. She couldn’t see a future with me. She said she was bothered by what I told her about my current situation — that I couldn’t afford her what I wanted to give yet, that she didn't want to wait for someone who cannot risk for her. She said she didn’t want something extravagant, just something with real care. She felt like I wasn’t even making time to see her.

She said things that I was similar to her exes. She thought I was different, but maybe I wasn’t. She asked for space.

Before that, I had invited her to a friend’s birthday hangout. She refused. That was when I started to panic.

From then until June 13, I became desperate, but I hadn't realized this until after June 13. I didn’t give her space because I haven't really believed about the effectiveness of giving space before, I know it's due to my past experiences that I believed it. I messaged her constantly, trying to win her back. I even tried to call her. She refused at first, but I begged her to just listen, and she did. I poured out everything — my regrets, my sincerity, my hope.

I invited her to meet on June 10. She said yes. I planned everything. But she canceled on the day itself. I still wanted to do something, so I sent her flowers and a letter that night.

She messaged me. She said she was surprised and thanked me — but also said that it would change anything. That she had made her decision.

On June 13, I messaged again, saying about how much I'm hoping for us and for a chance, that's where she had enough. She finally told me everything. She said the flowers made her feel worse. That her ex did the same. It made her feel like I was just like them. I explained that while the action might be the same, the intention was different. But I couldn’t save what we had. We ended things — in good terms, she said that I should love myself more first because I can't give love to someone when I'm not confident about myself, but after that we're not cut off yet.

On June 16, I left her a goodnight note. She replied. Then we started exchanging notes daily.

On June 18, I went to the province for almost 2 weeks with my uncle. I learned a lot about self-love and reflection during that time.

When I got back, things were cold again. I reached out and asked if we could meet on July 1. She didn’t reply directly but asked if I was available on August 9 — her early debut. She reminded me that I was supposed to be her cotillion partner, and she's planning on doing it.

I asked if the event would be in our hometown because I had just learned my classes started on July 7, and I hadn't told her about my schedule, which has Saturday classes because I knew she'd not continue her plan for me. She said there would be practices days before. She told me it was okay if I couldn’t come. But I insisted. I said I’d go home every weekend, to book for ferry or flight. I even planned to work part-time to afford it.

On June 27, our university announced that classes would start on August 4 instead. I was so happy. I could save more and only focus on my flight to attend her event at August 9.

From then until June 30, I only sent her short notes. On June 30, I asked again if we could meet on July 1. She asked what for. I said to hang out and talk. She agreed.

When we met, I had planned for something light, it wasn't supposedly not to deep talk. But when I saw her, I could tell she was expecting something serious. I asked if she was okay. She said yes — but I knew she wasn’t.

I apologized, and we had a deep talk. I kept reassuring her that I didn’t want to give up. I admitted my faults. She told me she was exhausted. That it felt one-sided. That I wasn’t really risking anything for her.

I respected her feelings, but I admit that I also got respectfully defensive, about what I can give and I can prove because I wanted her to know I was changing. I told her I didn’t want her to just be a reason to become better — I wanted myself to grow and become better with her.

I reminded her of what she told me on June 13, how I got motivated by it — that I should fill my own cup first. I’ve been doing that. I kept saying that this will be worth it, that I'm willing for change, I assured my intentions. But her answer remained, “I don’t know, I just don't know anymore.”

She said she wanted to go home. I offered to walk her. She agreed. I asked if she had a bit of time left and invited her for cold coffee. After that, she said she’d take a taxi. I walked her to the taxi and said goodbye.

I messaged her and said thank you so much fot the time and told her to stay safe. She replied, “Thank you. You too.”

That night, I told her in a note that I’d give her space but that I’d still be here. On July 2, I left another note wishing her a good day. But she never replied anymore. She ended our TikTok streak that night too and reposted something about being in her “cutting off era.”

That’s when I knew it was really over.

The last hope I held on to was being her cotillion partner. But I couldn’t ask her directly anymore because of what recently happened. On July 3, I asked a friend who was invited and in the cotillion, about if she said something about the practice schedule, and said there's none yet, and also insisted that he'd ask her if I was still her cotillion partner. That friend asked her directly.

That’s when I learned — I was no longer her partner, and she replied it casually as if there's nothing happened.

I wasn’t home when I found out. My heart shattered. I walked aimlessly crossed roads a bunch of times, almost got hit by cars. That’s when I accepted it: it was over.

I regret being desperate. I regret not respecting the space she asked for. I dragged it out for so long when it could’ve ended it when it ended in peace between us.

But swore to myself that I'm changing. I’m growing, where I could've shown it to her. This change is for me, my growth, and could've been for the both of us.

Maybe one day. Maybe after years, we'll cross paths again, maybe she’ll see who I became. I still believe people deserve chances. But I know that’s not up to me.

The thing is I really loved her, she was my 1st time and I only loved her on the ways that I still know how to, I've been constantly learning because I wanted it to be better for us, for us to grow and learn together. It's so hard for me because what I feel is that I gave what I could give, haven't realized that it was considered as minimum effort. I will note it and will do my best to risk and love myself more.

Thank you for reading. I’m open to any thoughts or advice, please feel free. Because I believe that part of growing is learning from mistakes. I’m here for that.

1lrzdam,https://i.redd.it/1mxz1n93uyaf1.jpeg,Just updated my minimal journal app,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share a quick update on my iPad journal app, it’s called Mino.

There’s now a simple swipe gesture for navigation. When you’re using an iPad and have finger drawing turned off, you can draw with Apple Pencil and swipe with your fingers to move between pages. It’s not a fancy feature, but it makes the journaling experience feel a bit smoother and more natural.

I also added a freehand crop tool, which is part of the Pro features. The crop itself is nothing new. It works like any other freehand crop, where you draw a line around the part of the photo you want to keep. What makes it a bit more fun is a toggle that adds an outline and shadow, giving the cropped image a sticker like feeling. It’s a small detail, but I personally really like using it when decorating pages.

If you haven’t seen my post about the app before, here’s a quick overview. It’s focused on freeform journaling with Apple Pencil, using dotted or squared grid pages without any preset templates. I wanted something that feels flexible and minimal, so you can create your own system instead of fitting into a fixed layout. It’s built mainly for iPad, but it syncs with iCloud so you can view your pages on iPhone too.

The app is free to download, and you can use the basic journaling tools without paying. If you enjoy decorating your pages with photos, stickers, or extra features, there is a one time Pro upgrade with no subscription.

If you’d like to give it a try, you can download it here:

App Store: [Mino: Minimal Journal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mino-minimal-journal/id6470970423)

If you want to see more details about Pro features or get in touch, here’s the website:

I've been talking to this woman for a few months now. She's beautiful, fun, laughs at my jokes, and actually seeks me out to have a conversation. It feels amazing when she's the one to seek me out, instead of me being the one to initiate contact every time. I thought I swore off the idea of dating for good, which is why when this girl is showing signs of interest (I hadn't seen her for a week or so and when I ask her where she's been, she says I've been working the night shifts so she never got a chance to say hi to me - I never told her that. She asked my coworkers about my schedule.) and asked me if I wanted to join her in the pool, I was a bit taken off guard.  
  
Yeah, it's not a date for sure, but I was hoping to take it as an opportunity to ask her out on a proper coffee date. You might be thinking, ""well, you clearly love interacting with this woman and she invited you out, why WOULDN'T you say yes?""

Well, here's the thing. In the past, I attracted women in just about the same way people attract mosquitoes. Or leeches. I've been through *plenty* of abusive relationships in the past that sucked me dry of everything I had to give. I had no enthusiasm, no money, no love for life. I gave every single shred of myself to keep women close to me that ultimately did not care for me, and only wanted to use me for what resources I could give them. Some days got close to the point I was genuinely contemplating suicide because one ex was trying to convince me I only mattered to her and nobody else. Crazy right?

So when this wonderful woman comes, there's this voice in the back of my head that tells me ""Cut her off."", ""She's just trying to use you."", ""She doesn't actually care about you like you care about her,"", ""You don't attract healthy women, she's a psychopath like all the rest"", etc etc. I *know* it's not true and that I couldn't possibly know this girl is somehow insane, but there's a nervous itch that keeps telling me that I should just cut her off and block her before I get hurt again.

I could really use some words of encouragement from some guys and girls who have gone through so much of the same issues I had and still found someone they can be happy with since I don't know if I can trust myself to actually not flake on her.

Bees were melting into and firing out of the foliage simultaneously like a busy airport. That's when I realized my neighbor was lax in their hive inspections.

But one thing keeps bugging me, and I’d love to hear the community’s perspective.

If I use Bitcoin to buy something — say a coffee — that’s considered a disposition of an asset by the CRA here in Canada. That would trigger a capital gains tax, depending on what I originally paid for that BTC. That’s not how spending actual money works — I don’t pay capital gains when I use fiat at a store.

So here’s my question:
If Bitcoin is truly money, shouldn’t it be treated like money from a tax perspective too? The way things are now, it feels like the system is pushing people not to use it in daily life.

Is this just a growing pain until tax laws catch up? Or is this part of the trade-off we accept in exchange for having money the state can’t manipulate?",49,1751681527.0,Bitcoin,60,0.96,False

He said he doesn’t want to waste time if we’re not on the same page long term, which I respect. But now I’m kinda wondering... what should I be asking him too? Like I don’t want to dive into full-on interview mode, but I also don’t wanna be blind to stuff that might matter down the road.

Do you ask about values? Past relationships? How they handle stress or money? Or do you just kinda learn as you go? I feel like there’s a fine line between being curious and being too intense too early. What’s worked for you?",1,1751681356.0,DatingTips,0,1.0,False

I’m making this follow-up post to raise awareness and stand in solidarity with everyone who has been banned from Coffee Meets Bagel after paying for a subscription, without warning, explanation, or refund.

Over the past day, I’ve connected with multiple users who shared almost identical stories:

	•	They paid for premium
	•	Got banned without reason
	•	Received generic support responses
	•	Were denied any refund or appeal process

This isn’t just frustrating — in many cases, it’s likely illegal, and we do have rights under consumer protection laws, especially under the EU’s Digital Services Act for those currently in the EU.

⸻

🚨 A Note to Moderators

This subreddit is one of the few public spaces where affected users can come together and exchange information. If this post is removed or if I am banned for simply sharing legitimate grievances and organizing victims, I will treat it as a coordinated suppression of consumer complaints, and I am prepared to escalate accordingly:

	•	I will report it to Reddit Trust & Safety
	•	I will preserve this thread as evidence
	•	I will include it in documentation submitted to consumer protection agencies and public interest forums
	•	And, if needed, I will consult with legal experts on broader accountability for platforms that silence consumers while profiting from their losses

⸻

If You’re a Victim Too

Please don’t stay silent. Even if you don’t want to escalate, you deserve to be heard. Comment here or DM me — even one more voice helps make the issue harder to ignore.

This isn’t just about dating apps. It’s about platforms being held accountable when they take your money and disappear.

We are not powerless.

1lrz3iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lrz3iw/aitah_for_not_caring_about_my_grandmothers/,AITAH for not caring about my grandmother's possible passing?,"I 16F don't really care about my grandmother's passing for some context my parents are immigrants moved to Greece for work I've lived on this island my whole life been to Albania maybe 6 or 8 times only briefly though just for new years or Christmas. My whole life I've been told we lived too far away that we couldn't afford seeing realities commonly so I disconnected. I was only close with my mom (40f) most of my other relatives felt like side characters on an episode of a cartoon forgetting their names and faces wasn't hard at all even if we talked through video calling a lot of the time. 
Recently aka the past 4 years my grandmother with dementia has been living alone in her house in albania since my aunt and her family moved to Athens due to some drama with her caretaker and her diabetes though she recently moved too living with my aunt some sort of infection on her foot or something isn't healing due to the diabetes and such so theyre all living together again grandma being I and out of hospitals and reasonably meaner now in pain and forgetting more with time. 

She was supposed to be getting better until as of today 3 days ago she was spontaneously completely fine asking for coffee remembering my mom(who she rarely remembers) I was suspicious having read a lot of stories about old or sick people getting spontaneously better before the end but I didn't speak up just said hi to my aunts and left the room. I was told the video ccalk ended and some time later my cousin found our grandma face down on her bed. Cardiac arrest. She tried helping she screamed for my aunt and uncle who were sleeping in their room fairly small house easy to run from room to room. When they got my grandma to the hospital my aunt called still crying the doctor was speaking I that flat grim tone many might know said her condition was critical that we might need to get ready. 

At this point my mom is sobbing my aunts are panicking not like they didn't expect it sooner or later but it was sudden. Too sudden she was fine. My cousin wasn't told anything I was though my mom trying to find comfort in me who barely can comfort one of my crying friends about small inconveniences let alone fucking death. When I was silent giving nothing but hugs and making myself and my mom busy by tidying ip around the house she got that look in her eyes that dissapointment but weird understanding 

Mom knew I'm  not like my cousin V (15f) I didn't grow up around grandma never connected never could my mom turned cold for the rest of the day after that silently crying as I didn't know what to do. Emotions make me uncomfortable I dont know what to say, where to look, what to do in general She knows that better than anyone So when today she took me shopping I the center of our town cuz she needed black clothes ""just in case"" she bought me stuff too most in colour as she explained that I didn't have to wear black except the day of I couldn't hold it anymore on the bus on the way back I blurted out words I could never phrase correctly enough 

""I feel guilty that It wont affect me emough"" my mom looked, angry for a second before she said the sane thing again ""you aren't as close with her it's fine"" I tried to say more but words weren't fucking getting out it was so hard to not cry right there it was true I didn't care about my grandma passing soon. But I cared about how I'd affect the ones I love more... my mom, my cousin

Especially my cousins V she's my everything almost my sister she'll be affected the most in my opinion raised since diapers with grandma being the one who found her if it happens j dont want to stay behind in Greece I want to go too not because the funeral is something that I want to attend but because I want to be there for them there to hold V's hand as she cries hug my mom like I did when we visited my grandpa's grave when I was little

I told my mom all of that and she still seemed angry maybe not with me but she looked ready to take it out on me though I feel sorry and I care but not for grandma but for everyone that'll be left behind.",2,1751681087.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1lryzmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lryzmw/whispers_in_the_lumber/,Whispers in the Lumber,"I’ve hauled freight up and down the northern border for the better part of twelve years. It’s quiet work, mostly. A lot of long nights, empty highways, and hours to think.

Before this, I was in logistics for the Army. Got deployed twice. Desert heat, endless paperwork, a thousand moving parts to make sure convoys got from point A to point B without turning into headlines. After I mustered out, this felt like the natural fit. Hauling timber instead of tanks. Paper bills instead of orders. Still moving things. Still useful.

I typically drove at night. Less traffic, fewer distractions. My route from Thunder Bay to Duluth had become second nature, winding through forested backroads and long stretches of blacktop so straight they felt like they’d split the earth in two. I’d stop for gas, keep the CB on low, sip strong coffee, and let the world slip by.

Most nights were uneventful. That’s what I liked about it. Predictable. Solitary. I’ve always been a skeptic by nature. Grew up practical. Never put much stock in ghost stories or campfire nonsense.

Then came the job last October.

I crossed the border late, around 11:30 PM. It was drizzling, and the customs guy looked at me longer than normal. Young kid. Had to ask twice for my paperwork like his head was somewhere else.

“Got a lot of lumber in there,” he said, peering past me into the darkness.

“Yeah,” I replied. “Same shipment type as last week.”

He nodded, but didn’t move. “You hear anything back there, you don’t stop. You understand?”

I blinked. “What?”

He shook his head, like shaking off a thought. “Drive safe, sir.”

I chalked it up to a bad night. Maybe he’d seen some weird moose on the road or had a fight with his girlfriend. I drove off, tires humming on wet pavement.

A couple hours into Minnesota, the road dipped into a thick stretch of forest. Pines rising like walls on both sides. The heater in my cab was on full blast, but I felt cold. Not a breeze-through-the-window kind of cold, more like the kind that creeps inside your bones.

That’s when I heard the whispering.

It was faint. Like someone mumbling just beneath the sound of the engine. I turned off the radio. Nothing. But the whispering didn’t stop.

I cracked the window, thinking maybe it was wind. Trees brushing against each other. Nothing out there but darkness.

I shook my head. Just tired. I’d been pushing too hard. The road was hypnotic, and fatigue could play tricks.

Then the CB crackled.

Not static. Not a voice either. Something… in between. Like someone trying to talk through a throat full of gravel. Words half-formed and warped, broken and backward. I turned the volume down, then off.

Still, the whispers continued.

In my rearview mirror, something moved.

Just for a second. A flicker. A silhouette darting past the trailer. But when I turned to look directly, nothing. Just the steady rhythm of my own headlights and the long black ribbon of the road.

I pulled into a rest stop sometime past 2:00 AM. Place was deserted. One broken vending machine buzzing near the bathroom and a flickering overhead light that made the shadows twitch. I stepped out, the cold slapping me awake.

The trailer was quiet. I circled it slowly, boots crunching over gravel.

That’s when I saw the marks.

Claw-like gouges along one side of the lumber stack. Four deep scratches on a plank near the top, too high for any animal I know. The wood splintered outward, like something had been trying to get out. Or in.

I didn’t like the way my skin prickled. I chalked it up to vandalism. Maybe someone screwed with the load in Canada and I hadn’t noticed. Maybe it was just old damage from a forklift.

I climbed back into the cab, started her up, and glanced once more into the rear window.

That’s when I saw it.

A pale hand, impossibly long, thin, almost skeletal, slithered back between the gaps in the lumber. Just for a split second. A blink. The hand pulled back and vanished into the darkness.

I slammed the brakes. Jumped out with my flashlight. But when I searched the trailer, there was nothing. No movement. No signs. Just cold air and the faint smell of wet wood.

I told myself it was a hallucination. Lack of sleep. Brain hiccups.

But my hands didn’t stop shaking.

I considered stopping in the next town, but dispatch was on my ass about delivery times. Said I was already behind. No room in the schedule for ghost stories.

So I kept driving.

The road narrowed, coiling like a snake through the hills. No streetlights. No signs. The forest leaned close on both sides like it was listening.

Then, the truck jerked hard to the right.

The engine sputtered. Dashboard lights blinked like a dying Christmas tree. I swore and yanked the wheel, guiding the rig onto the shoulder as the whole thing rumbled to a stop. Silence swallowed me.

I tried the ignition. Nothing. Dead.

I popped the hood, climbed out. The engine looked fine. No leaks, no smoke. But something smelled… wrong. Like old rot. Like something wet and alive had crawled into the machinery.

Behind me, the trailer groaned.

I turned.

The tarp covering the lumber was moving. Not from wind. It rippled in rhythmic waves, like something underneath was breathing.

Then it *tore*.

Figures pulled themselves free from the lumber pile. Twisted things, all limbs and splinters, like dead trees warped into the shape of men. Their skin was bark and sinew, mottled with knots. Eyes glowed faint green, like swamp lights. Their mouths didn’t open, but I heard them, deep inside my skull, whispering.

I ran.

I scrambled into the cab, slammed the door, locked it, shaking so hard I dropped my wrench.

The creatures swarmed the truck.

One climbed the hood, its hand cracking the windshield with a single strike. Another dragged claws along the side door, leaving deep gouges in the metal.

I reached under the passenger seat. There, inside the old metal box I never thought I’d need, was my emergency satellite phone.

I called for help. My voice was hoarse, barely coherent. I gave my location, screamed that I was under attack. The dispatcher’s voice crackled, then the line went dead.

A creature shattered the passenger window.

I swung the wrench.

The blow connected. It screamed, a sound that pierced straight through the marrow. The others paused, pulled back. I didn’t wait. I kicked open the door and ran.

Behind me, they tore into the truck. I heard metal scream, glass pop. Then the whole cab groaned and flipped onto its side with a sickening crunch.

I hit the ditch hard. Everything spun. I don’t remember much after that.

When the highway patrol found me hours later, I was walking barefoot down the center of the road. Covered in blood and mud. I couldn’t say my name. Couldn’t say anything except, “The things… in the wood.”

They said it was a freak accident. Said my truck died and the load shifted, caused the crash. Said I must’ve hit my head, hallucinated the rest.

But I saw the lumber. Saw how it twisted. How some planks had warped into almost-human shapes. Limbs. Faces. Eyes frozen mid-scream.

The investigating officer didn’t say anything. But he didn’t look right either. Like he’d seen it too.

They called it trauma. Told me to rest. Said I’d probably never drive again.

And they were right.

I never went back on the road.

But I still hear the whispers.

Sometimes, when the wind moves through the trees outside my window, I swear I can still see those eyes, glowing faint in the dark.

Waiting.

I shook my head. Just tired. I’d been pushing too hard. The road was hypnotic, and fatigue could play tricks.

Then the CB crackled.

Not static. Not a voice either. Something… in between. Like someone trying to talk through a throat full of gravel. Words half-formed and warped, broken and backward. I turned the volume down, then off.

Still, the whispers continued.

In my rearview mirror, something moved.

Just for a second. A flicker. A silhouette darting past the trailer. But when I turned to look directly, nothing. Just the steady rhythm of my own headlights and the long black ribbon of the road.

I pulled into a rest stop sometime past 2:00 AM. Place was deserted. One broken vending machine buzzing near the bathroom and a flickering overhead light that made the shadows twitch. I stepped out, the cold slapping me awake.

The trailer was quiet. I circled it slowly, boots crunching over gravel.

That’s when I saw the marks.

Claw-like gouges along one side of the lumber stack. Four deep scratches on a plank near the top, too high for any animal I know. The wood splintered outward, like something had been trying to get out. Or in.

I didn’t like the way my skin prickled. I chalked it up to vandalism. Maybe someone screwed with the load in Canada and I hadn’t noticed. Maybe it was just old damage from a forklift.

I climbed back into the cab, started her up, and glanced once more into the rear window.

That’s when I saw it.

A pale hand, impossibly long, thin, almost skeletal, slithered back between the gaps in the lumber. Just for a split second. A blink. The hand pulled back and vanished into the darkness.

I slammed the brakes. Jumped out with my flashlight. But when I searched the trailer, there was nothing. No movement. No signs. Just cold air and the faint smell of wet wood.

I told myself it was a hallucination. Lack of sleep. Brain hiccups.

But my hands didn’t stop shaking.

I considered stopping in the next town, but dispatch was on my ass about delivery times. Said I was already behind. No room in the schedule for ghost stories.

So I kept driving.

The road narrowed, coiling like a snake through the hills. No streetlights. No signs. The forest leaned close on both sides like it was listening.

Then, the truck jerked hard to the right.

The engine sputtered. Dashboard lights blinked like a dying Christmas tree. I swore and yanked the wheel, guiding the rig onto the shoulder as the whole thing rumbled to a stop. Silence swallowed me.

I tried the ignition. Nothing. Dead.

I popped the hood, climbed out. The engine looked fine. No leaks, no smoke. But something smelled… wrong. Like old rot. Like something wet and alive had crawled into the machinery.

Behind me, the trailer groaned.

I turned.

The tarp covering the lumber was moving. Not from wind. It rippled in rhythmic waves, like something underneath was breathing.

Then it *tore*.

Figures pulled themselves free from the lumber pile. Twisted things, all limbs and splinters, like dead trees warped into the shape of men. Their skin was bark and sinew, mottled with knots. Eyes glowed faint green, like swamp lights. Their mouths didn’t open, but I heard them, deep inside my skull, whispering.

I ran.

I scrambled into the cab, slammed the door, locked it, shaking so hard I dropped my wrench.

The creatures swarmed the truck.

One climbed the hood, its hand cracking the windshield with a single strike. Another dragged claws along the side door, leaving deep gouges in the metal.

I reached under the passenger seat. There, inside the old metal box I never thought I’d need, was my emergency satellite phone.

I called for help. My voice was hoarse, barely coherent. I gave my location, screamed that I was under attack. The dispatcher’s voice crackled, then the line went dead.

A creature shattered the passenger window.

I swung the wrench.

The blow connected. It screamed, a sound that pierced straight through the marrow. The others paused, pulled back. I didn’t wait. I kicked open the door and ran.

Behind me, they tore into the truck. I heard metal scream, glass pop. Then the whole cab groaned and flipped onto its side with a sickening crunch.

I hit the ditch hard. Everything spun. I don’t remember much after that.

When the highway patrol found me hours later, I was walking barefoot down the center of the road. Covered in blood and mud. I couldn’t say my name. Couldn’t say anything except, “The things… in the wood.”

They said it was a freak accident. Said my truck died and the load shifted, caused the crash. Said I must’ve hit my head, hallucinated the rest.

But I saw the lumber. Saw how it twisted. How some planks had warped into almost-human shapes. Limbs. Faces. Eyes frozen mid-scream.

The investigating officer didn’t say anything. But he didn’t look right either. Like he’d seen it too.

They called it trauma. Told me to rest. Said I’d probably never drive again.

And they were right.

I never went back on the road.

But I still hear the whispers.

Sometimes, when the wind moves through the trees outside my window, I swear I can still see those eyes, glowing faint in the dark.

Waiting.

Listening.

I’ve hauled freight up and down the northern border for the better part of twelve years. It’s quiet work, mostly. A lot of long nights, empty highways, and hours to think.

Before this, I was in logistics for the Army. Got deployed twice. Desert heat, endless paperwork, a thousand moving parts to make sure convoys got from point A to point B without turning into headlines. After I mustered out, this felt like the natural fit. Hauling timber instead of tanks. Paper bills instead of orders. Still moving things. Still useful.

I typically drove at night. Less traffic, fewer distractions. My route from Thunder Bay to Duluth had become second nature, winding through forested backroads and long stretches of blacktop so straight they felt like they’d split the earth in two. I’d stop for gas, keep the CB on low, sip strong coffee, and let the world slip by.

Most nights were uneventful. That’s what I liked about it. Predictable. Solitary. I’ve always been a skeptic by nature. Grew up practical. Never put much stock in ghost stories or campfire nonsense.

Then came the job last October.

I crossed the border late, around 11:30 PM. It was drizzling, and the customs guy looked at me longer than normal. Young kid. Had to ask twice for my paperwork like his head was somewhere else.

“Got a lot of lumber in there,” he said, peering past me into the darkness.

“Yeah,” I replied. “Same shipment type as last week.”

He nodded, but didn’t move. “You hear anything back there, you don’t stop. You understand?”

I blinked. “What?”

He shook his head, like shaking off a thought. “Drive safe, sir.”

I chalked it up to a bad night. Maybe he’d seen some weird moose on the road or had a fight with his girlfriend. I drove off, tires humming on wet pavement.

A couple hours into Minnesota, the road dipped into a thick stretch of forest. Pines rising like walls on both sides. The heater in my cab was on full blast, but I felt cold. Not a breeze-through-the-window kind of cold, more like the kind that creeps inside your bones.

That’s when I heard the whispering.

I (M21, then) met a girl (F25, then) while we were both visiting our parents in a different country. Our families were next door neighbors in a small apartment house, and for ~6 weeks, we were together every day. Shared meals, families got close, family outings, one on one dates, through our parents became aware of some insecurities only very close friends/a partner would know.

Our dates were a dance of hesitations and some brutal mixed signals from both of us that led to nothing romantic. Our flight dates for back home (where we actually live 2 blocks away) were 10 days apart. I thought once home and without the presence of our parents, something finally will happen. Our parents also expected us to keep regular contact, and while she was back home and i was waiting for my flight date, she even said she is gonna take me out for a coffee as a thank you because i did a thing for her. We were also both planning to move in with our parents soon.

Once back home i tried to setup a date but she started fading, replying in hours, then days. That went on for 2-3 weeks and i could barely keep a conversation going. I know i should’ve taken this as a no but i was confused really. I finally asked her when we were gonna go out, she replied 3 days later how she was busy with a wedding, and we could arrange it. I gracefully took the rejection and told her to hit me up if she ever wants to, leaving the door open.

I never saw this coming, it was a shock in the moment and i try to tell myself she was just fading and it’s my fault for not taking a polite “no” as an answer. I’m even blaming myself for some brutal mixed signals on my part (won’t go into detail because post will get long but they are bad).

My question: Why would someone fade/ghost so completely after such intense, daily proximity and apparent mutual confusion during one-on-one moments, rather than just communicating directly? It still stings, i really really liked her and I'm trying to interpret this for closure. I’m kinda blaming myself.

I don’t know if it’s off topic, but I just thought this is a funny story to share.

So, yesterday I arranged a date with a girl I liked from the same building I work at. I barely knew her, I had talked her only 3-4 times, but she is kinda cute at told her we should get a coffee. The date was going normally, we talked about our jobs, our degrees, etc. Then… she asked about my hobbies. I told her I loved barre and that I often take 3-4 classes a week. She didn’t know what barre was, so I told her it was ballet + pilates + yoga. She just gave me a weird look and said “ok…”, then she said I was “kind of girly” (I think it was a joke-not-a-joke situation). She clearly lost interest lol. I think it just wasn’t meant to be.


I think it’s funny how people still think we should only enjoy things society tell you you should enjoy based on your gender. In my opinion it limits your scope and makes you miss on a lot of opportunities. Now I hope my next date enjoys barre lol. ",35,1751680026.0,Purebarre,15,0.95,False

I'm a 28-year-old guy who moved back to Vancouver from Edmonton late last year, and I'm looking to meet people who are down for real conversations and shared experiences.

Life's been pretty transformative lately. I recently came out to my family as gay, and I've been focusing a lot on personal growth, mentally, physically, and spiritually (though I'm not religious). I've been diving into new hobbies and finally picking up skills I've always wanted to learn.

These days I'm super active. You'll catch me doing Muay Thai kickboxing 5–6 times a week, hitting the gym, going for long walks in nature, or swimming. Shifting into this lifestyle has honestly changed my life for the better.

Music is a huge part of who I am. I've spent over 10 years singing in choirs and vocal jazz ensembles of different levels, and right now I'm learning jazz piano. I actually have a degree in Computer Science with a minor in music, which pretty much sums up my brain perfectly. My taste is all over the place, but indie folk, jazz, and pop are my holy trinity. Always down to discover new artists or share favourites.

When I'm not being active or making music, you'll probably find me gaming. I used to be into Overwatch and Destiny 2 a lot, but lately I've been gravitating toward story-rich RPGs and games with innovative mechanics. My favourite recent game is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.

I'm also a big foodie. Growing up in a Chinese household and moving to Canada at 16 gave me a deep appreciation for how food connects people and cultures. I'm always chasing that sweet spot between tasty and healthy. Honestly, suggesting a new restaurant is probably the fastest way to get me excited about hanging out.

Career wise, I'm exploring paths in game development and sound engineering, both of which I have some experience in. It feels like the perfect intersection of my tech background and creative passions.

I'm looking to meet people for coffee chats, trying new food spots, outdoor hangouts, deep convos about life, sharing music and even some co-op gaming sessions. Really, anything that feels genuine. I get along best with people who are curious, kind, open, and up for both spontaneous adventures and meaningful conversations. If we click, I'd love to have you along for this journey of growth.

1lrylr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1lrylr5/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

Reasons 
1) You can't get an accurate gauge of how much she genuinely likes you because you're providing a SERVICE to her essentially. If she feels ""meh, he's okay but he has money and can give me free dinners, he's gonna treat me like a princess and spoil me, etc."", then she's gonna use you, waste your time and jerk you around. There's a lot of girls who know how to flirt, even will kiss and sex with you just to get that benefit and keep you hooked. EVEN MORE DANGEROUS IF SHE'S NOT TRYING TO TOY WITH YOU because she's not being evil but she's not THAT interested so she's gonna look for the benefit solely. 

2) You put her in a corner. If you pay for everything on an expensive dinner or put her in a position where she has to 50-50 and then expect intimacy or sex......A lot of women are gonna take off. You can't buy sexual attraction. There's women will insist to pay 50-50 because she isn't into it and doesn't want to held to that unwritten contract. 

3) You want to see how she reacts to the bare minimum. If the girl is REALLY into you, just being with you is ENOUGH. If she isn't, this weeds her QUICK.

1lryfar,https://youtu.be/iWQz2b1mgQY,3 Very Scary TRUE Sleepwalking Horror Stories,"# ""Sleepwalker on the Edge"":

I never thought I’d be afraid to go to sleep, but that’s where it all began. It started with little things—odd signs I couldn’t explain. I’d wake up in the morning and find the fridge door ajar, or a half-eaten apple on the counter that I didn’t remember touching. At first, I thought I was just tired. My new job had me working late, and the sleeping pills my doctor prescribed were supposed to help me rest. Maybe they were making me forgetful. I laughed it off, but deep down, something felt wrong.

One night, I woke up, but I wasn’t in my bed. I was in my car, parked on a quiet street two blocks from my house. The keys were in the ignition, and I was sitting in the driver’s seat, still in my pajamas. My heart pounded as I tried to remember how I got there, but my mind was blank. I drove home, my hands trembling, and told my roommate, Lisa, what happened. She frowned, her eyes wide with concern. “You’ve been so stressed,” she said. “Maybe you just need a break.”

But it didn’t stop. A few nights later, I woke up again, this time with the car moving. I was driving 30 miles an hour down a dark, empty road. The streetlights flashed by, and my stomach dropped. I slammed on the brakes, the car screeching to a stop. I looked around, my breath shallow, and realized I was near an old, abandoned factory on the edge of town. How had I driven here? I had no memory of leaving my bed. I turned the car around, my hands shaking so badly I could barely grip the wheel. When I got home, Lisa was awake, pacing. “Where were you?” she asked, her voice sharp. “You scared me!”

I told her everything, my voice cracking. “I was driving, Lisa. Asleep. I don’t know how it happened.” Her face went pale. “You could’ve crashed,” she said. “You could’ve hurt someone. You need to see a doctor.”

The next day, I went to a sleep specialist. Dr. Patel listened as I poured out my story. “It sounds like sleep driving,” he said calmly. “It’s rare, but it can happen, especially with certain medications. The sleeping pills you’re taking might be causing it.” He explained that some drugs, like zolpidem, can trigger sleepwalking or even more complex behaviors, like driving, with no memory afterward. “Stop the pills immediately,” he said. “And lock up your car keys at night. Give them to someone you trust.”

I nodded, feeling a mix of relief and fear. I gave my keys to Lisa and stopped taking the pills. For a week, nothing happened. I started to think it was over. But then, one night, I woke up in a 24-hour diner, sitting at a booth with a plate of pancakes and a coffee I didn’t remember ordering. I was still in my pajamas, and the waitress gave me a strange look as I stumbled out, my heart racing. When I got home, Lisa was frantic. “You were gone for an hour!” she said. “Your car’s still here, so how did you even leave?”

I checked my phone. It was 3 a.m. The diner was miles away—too far to walk in an hour. “I don’t know,” I whispered, my voice shaking. “I don’t know how I got there.”

I went back to Dr. Patel. “If you don’t have your keys, how are you getting out?” he asked, puzzled. He suggested setting up a camera in my house and car to monitor my sleep. That night, I did it, my stomach churning as I went to bed. The next morning, I watched the footage. At 1:45 a.m., I got out of bed, eyes open but blank, like a zombie. I went to the kitchen, opened a drawer, and pulled out a spare set of keys I’d forgotten about. Then I walked out, got in my car, and drove away.

The video showed me driving to the diner, ordering food, eating, and paying—all while asleep. I drove back, parked the car in the exact same spot, and went back to bed. I felt sick watching it. If I could do all that without knowing, what else could I do? What if I hurt someone?

Dr. Patel prescribed a new medication to regulate my sleep and suggested therapy to address any stress or trauma that might be triggering this. But the fear clung to me. Every night, I went to bed wondering where I’d wake up next.

Two nights ago, it got worse. I woke up in my car, the engine off, but I wasn’t on a road. I was on a narrow dirt path, the front wheels of my car inches from the edge of a cliff. Below, I could see the ocean, waves crashing against jagged rocks. The car door was open, and one of my legs was dangling outside, as if I’d been about to step out. My breath caught in my throat. I froze, terrified that any movement might send the car over the edge.

Carefully, I pulled my leg back in and closed the door, my hands shaking so badly I could barely hold the wheel. I reversed slowly, dirt crunching under the tires, until I was back on solid ground. When I got home, I collapsed, sobbing. I called Dr. Patel immediately. “This is dangerous,” he said. “You need to stop driving entirely until this is under control. Stay somewhere safe, where you can’t access a car.”

I couldn’t just stop living my life, but I knew he was right. I gave Lisa all my keys, even the spares, and installed an alarm on my bedroom door that would wake me if I tried to leave. Last night was the first night with the new setup. I slept poorly, jumping at every sound, but when I woke up this morning, I was still in my bed. The alarm hadn’t gone off.

For the first time in weeks, I felt a flicker of hope. But as I sit here, I can’t shake the image of that cliff, the car teetering on the edge, my leg half out the door. Somewhere, deep in my mind, there’s a part of me that’s still asleep, waiting to take over. And that scares me more than anything.





# ""Me Isn’t Me Anymore"":

I’ve been a sleepwalker since I was a kid. Back then, it was almost funny—my parents would find me in the kitchen, eating cereal at 3 a.m., or standing in the backyard, staring at the stars. They’d guide me back to bed, and we’d laugh about it in the morning. But now, at 28, living alone in an old house I rented, it’s not funny anymore. It’s terrifying.

It started getting weird a few months ago. I’d wake up in places I didn’t expect—like the living room couch or the front porch. Once, I found myself in the garage, holding a hammer, with no idea why. My hands were shaking as I put it down, wondering what I’d been planning to do. I started locking my bedroom door at night, hoping it would keep me contained. But it didn’t.

One morning, I woke up in the basement. The door was locked from the inside, and the key was still in my bedroom. My heart pounded as I climbed the creaky stairs, trying to figure out how I’d gotten down there. The basement is a place I avoid—damp, dark, with cobwebs in every corner. Why would I go there in my sleep?

I decided to see a doctor. He said sleepwalking is a parasomnia, a sleep disorder where your brain doesn’t fully wake up, but your body moves anyway. He prescribed pills to help me stay asleep, but they didn’t work. If anything, things got worse.

Last week, I woke up to a loud crash. I bolted upright, my pulse racing, and ran downstairs. The front door was wide open, and the glass in the small window beside it was shattered. On the coffee table sat a kitchen knife, its blade glinting in the dim light. My stomach dropped. Did I do this? Was someone else in the house?

I checked every room, but no one was there. I called my neighbor, Tom, who lives across the street. He’s a kind older guy, always checking in on me since I moved in. “Tom, did you hear anything last night?” I asked, my voice shaky.

He paused. “I saw you, you know. Around midnight. You were standing on your porch, holding something shiny. I thought you were awake, but you didn’t answer when I called your name.”

I felt cold. “I was sleepwalking,” I said. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you.”

“It’s not just that,” he said, his voice low. “You were staring at my house. For a long time. It… it creeped me out.”

I apologized again, promising to fix it. But how could I? I had no control over what I did when I was asleep.

That night, I set up a cheap security camera in my living room, hoping to catch what I was doing. The next morning, I watched the footage. At 1:47 a.m., I walked downstairs, my eyes open but blank. I picked up the knife from the kitchen, held it for a moment, then set it on the coffee table. I walked to the front door, opened it, and stood on the porch, just like Tom said. But then I did something worse. I crossed the street, walked up to Tom’s front door, and tried the handle. It was locked, so I just stood there, staring, for ten minutes before walking back home.

I felt sick. Why was I trying to get into his house? What was I going to do with that knife? I couldn’t tell Tom—he’d think I was dangerous. Maybe I was.

I started chaining my bedroom door shut, using a bike lock I bought online. But two nights ago, I woke up in the attic. The chain was undone, the lock neatly placed on my nightstand. In the attic, I found a box of old photos I’d never seen before—pictures of people I didn’t know, their faces scratched out with a pen. My hands were smudged with ink.

I went back to the doctor, desperate. “This isn’t normal,” I said. “I’m doing things I don’t understand. I’m scared I’ll hurt someone.”

He suggested a sleep study, where they’d monitor me overnight. But it would take weeks to schedule, and I didn’t have weeks. I needed answers now.

Last night, I set up the camera again, this time in my bedroom. I took the pills, chained the door, and went to bed, praying I’d stay put. This morning, I checked the footage. My heart stopped as I watched.

At 2:13 a.m., I sat up in bed, my movements slow and deliberate. I unlocked the chain with the key I keep hidden in my dresser—how did I know where it was? I walked downstairs, grabbed a pen from the kitchen, and went to the basement. The camera didn’t cover down there, but when I checked this morning, I found a new photo on the basement floor. It was of Tom, taken through his window, his face scratched out like the others.

I called Tom, my voice trembling. “Can you come over? I need to show you something.”

When he arrived, I showed him the photo. His face went pale. “That’s from last night,” he said. “I was in my living room. How did you get this?”

“I don’t know,” I said, tears in my eyes. “I was sleepwalking. I’m so sorry.”

He backed away. “You need help,” he said. “This isn’t right. You’re scaring me.”

I’m scaring myself. Tonight, I’m not sleeping. I’ve thrown out the pills, boarded up the basement door, and I’m sitting here with every light on, watching the camera feed on my phone. But I can feel my eyes getting heavy, and I’m terrified of what I’ll do if I close them. Because whatever’s happening, it’s not just sleepwalking anymore. It’s like something inside me is awake when I’m not, and it’s trying to get out.





# ""I Woke Up 130 Feet in the Air"":

I was getting ready for bed like any other Friday night. My parents were downstairs watching TV, and my little brother was already asleep. I brushed my teeth, thinking about my plans to meet friends at the mall tomorrow. After setting my alarm, I climbed into bed, pulled the covers up, and drifted off.

I don’t know how long I was asleep when a cold breeze woke me. My eyes fluttered open, and I saw stars above me. Stars? I should be in my room. Confusion hit me like a wave. I wasn’t in my bed. I was lying on something hard and cold. My hands gripped a metal surface, and as my vision cleared, I looked around. I was high up—way too high. Below me, city lights twinkled, and the faint hum of traffic reached my ears. My heart pounded. Where was I?

I shifted slightly and realized I was on a narrow metal beam. To my sides, there was nothing but air. A sickening drop stretched far below, the ground so distant I could barely make out the shapes of buildings. Panic clawed at my chest. I was on a construction crane, perched on what looked like a counterweight. One wrong move, and I’d fall.

How did I get here? My mind raced, but it was blank. The last thing I remembered was climbing into bed. My breath came in short gasps. This had to be a dream. I pinched my arm, hard. Pain shot through me, but I didn’t wake up. This was real. My hands trembled as I clung to the metal, my fingers digging into the cold surface. The beam was so narrow, maybe a foot wide. If I moved too much, I’d slip.

I wanted to scream for help, but my throat was dry, my voice stuck. My heart thumped so loud I thought it might burst. I glanced down again, and my stomach lurched. The drop was endless—streetlights, cars, rooftops, all tiny specks below. I squeezed my eyes shut, willing myself to stay still.

Then I heard sirens. They were faint at first, growing louder. Flashing lights appeared below—red and blue, cutting through the darkness. Police cars and fire trucks pulled up to the construction site. People were pointing up at me, their voices muffled but urgent. Someone shouted through a megaphone, “Stay calm. We’re coming to get you.”

I managed a weak, “Okay,” but it was barely a whisper. My whole body shook. How long had I been up here? How had I even climbed this thing?

A firefighter appeared at the base of the crane, clipping a harness to himself. He started climbing the ladder, moving carefully but quickly. My eyes stayed glued to him, my only hope. As he got closer, I could see his face—focused, but with a flicker of worry in his eyes.

He reached the top and stepped onto the beam, inching toward me. “Hi there,” he said, his voice soft but steady. “I’m Tom. What’s your name?”

“Emily,” I whispered, my voice shaking as much as my hands.

“Emily, you’re doing great. I need you to stay very still. I’m going to help you, but you have to trust me, okay?”

I nodded, tears stinging my eyes. I was too scared to speak.

He knelt beside me, checking the beam and the counterweight. “First, I’m going to put a harness on you. Then we’ll get down together.”

As he spoke, I felt a vibration in my pocket. My phone? I didn’t even realize I had it with me. Tom noticed too. “Is that your phone?” he asked.

I nodded, barely able to move.

“Maybe it’s your family. Let’s check.” He carefully reached into my pocket and pulled out my phone. The screen showed “Mom” calling. My heart leapt—she must be terrified.

Tom answered, keeping his voice calm. “Hello, this is Firefighter Tom. I’m with your daughter, Emily. She’s safe, but she’s on a crane. We’re going to bring her down.”

I could hear my mom’s voice, high-pitched and frantic. “Is she okay? Please, is she okay?”

“She’s okay,” Tom said. “I’m with her now. We’re going to get her down safely.” He paused, listening, then said, “Yes, I’ll let her talk to you.”

He handed me the phone, and my hands shook as I took it. “Mom?”

“Emily!” Her voice broke. “Oh my God, are you okay?”

“I’m scared, Mom,” I said, my voice cracking. “I don’t know how I got here.”

“I know, sweetie. Just listen to the firefighter. He’ll take care of you. We’re right here waiting for you.”

“Okay,” I whispered, tears streaming down my face.

Tom took the phone back and spoke to my mom again. “We’re starting the rescue now. She’s in good hands.” He hung up and focused on me. “Alright, Emily, I’m going to put this harness on you. It might feel tight, but it’s to keep you safe.”

He worked quickly, slipping the harness around me. Every movement made me flinch, terrified I’d slip off the beam. The wind tugged at my hair, and I could feel the crane swaying slightly. My stomach churned. “Please don’t let me fall,” I whispered.

“I won’t,” Tom said firmly. “You’re secured now. We’re connected by this rope. I’ve got you.”

He attached a rope from his harness to mine, double-checking the knots. “Now, we’re going to move back to the ladder. I’ll go first, and you follow my lead. Slow and steady.”

I nodded, but my legs felt like jelly. Tom started inching back along the beam, holding the rope taut. I followed, crawling on my hands and knees, my fingers gripping the metal so hard my knuckles turned white. The beam was slick, and every step felt like a gamble. I didn’t dare look down, but I could feel the emptiness below me.

Halfway across, my foot slipped. I gasped, my body lurching to the side. The rope jerked tight, and Tom’s hand shot out, steadying me. “It’s okay, Emily,” he said, his voice calm but urgent. “I’ve got you. Just keep moving.”

My heart was in my throat, but I forced myself to keep going. Step by agonizing step, we made it to the ladder. Tom helped me onto the hydraulic lift that had been raised to meet us. I clung to the railing, my legs trembling so badly I could barely stand.

As we descended, the ground came into view. My parents were there, their faces pale and drawn. My mom was clutching my dad’s arm, tears streaming down her cheeks. The lift touched down, and my mom ran to me, wrapping me in a hug so tight I could barely breathe. “Oh, Emily, I was so scared,” she sobbed.

“I’m okay, Mom,” I said, though I was still shaking. My dad joined us, his eyes red but relieved.

The paramedics checked me over, wrapping me in a blanket. I was cold but unharmed, just shaken to my core. My dad spoke to the police, explaining that I’d been sleepwalking since I was a kid, but nothing like this had ever happened. “She’s wandered into the kitchen or the living room before,” he said, his voice tight. “But climbing a crane? I don’t understand.”

Tom, the firefighter, came over. “You were very brave up there, Emily,” he said. “Most people would’ve panicked.”

“Thank you for saving me,” I said, my voice small.

He smiled. “Just doing my job. But you might want to see a doctor about that sleepwalking. This was a close call.”

I nodded, still trying to process it all. The police and firefighters packed up, and we went home. That night, I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the drop from the crane, felt the cold metal under my hands. My parents installed alarms on the doors and windows the next day, and I started seeing a sleep specialist soon after.

But even now, years later, I can’t shake the terror of that night. Waking up 130 feet in the air, with no memory of how I got there, is a nightmare I’ll never forget. The thought that my own body could betray me like that, leading me into danger while I slept, still sends chills down my spine.",1,1751678692.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1lryf8v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lryf8v,Please help me take my own advice,"**Essay below:**

I have two vices: coffee and clothes. My problem isn't lack of knowledge; I know all the right things to do. I have recently decluttered 80% of my house so the rest of the living spaces are just right. Visual clutter stresses me out and I feel calmer in a decluttered space. But clothes are an issue for me.

I will go through cycles of stress-buying. So first I'll have a manageable amount of clothes (probably still too much), a major stress happens, and then I buy more. So part of the problem is the acquiring of new things, and then the process of getting rid of them. I'll donate and buy, rinse, repeat.

The second part of this is I struggle to get rid of the clothing once I've acquired them. Many times because I genuinely liked the item. Sometimes it is because I feel like it fills ""a gap"" or a feeling that I'm worried I'll run out or lose the item so I ""need"" extra. It's like a feeling of anxiety that constantly gnaws at me, like leaving a tap running or a task incomplete.

I have such an excessive amount that I struggle to decide what to wear, or items aren't worn at all. It's wasteful, expensive and stupid. Although about 3/4 of it was bought cheap secondhand, I still get mad with myself for it. It all adds up, and could have gone to better use. 

Recently I decided to pare my colour palette down to three colours, light neutral, dark neutral, and greens, with 1 item category in each colour. Experimenting with just wearing this reduced colour scheme this week has been very calming, and the addition of green stops it being boring.

This has helped a lot with the decision making and I have reduced down to my set of winter garments in the cupboard, and 2 1/2 boxes for other seasons/occasions stored away.

I have 3 bags to donate. It was really difficult even putting the clothes in there and I found myself going back and taking out a few items because I had second thoughts. Additionally, I have a box of items that are 'almost' perfect but are sitting there with the intention of altering them to fit better. (If I ever get around to that...)

Even with my reduction it still feels like I have way too many clothes. I fear the cycle starting over again and just doing the same impulsive thing in 6 months time. I think I need peer pressure/encouragement/accountability to stop being a dumbass. (Then maybe I can tackle the coffee...)

What should I be doing to actually make this stick and to follow through? If you have been in my position with a shopping addiction, what did you do to make permanent change?",7,1751678688.0,UnfuckYourHabitat,3,1.0,False

Then they yell back and forth for at LEAST five minutes which feels like hours. They refuse to resolve anything and just keep riling eachother up.  It’s ALWAYS the same unimportant stuff. Like are these the people who I’m supposed to learn from and look up to..? Honestly I’m doing everything I can to not treat the ppl I love like how they treat eachother but sometimes I catch myself expressing anger for small inconveniences and I feel terrible and always apologize and resolve unlike them and I haven’t been “hotheaded” in a while.

***Family is Hell***

*T*he rooster crows at the first spark of dawn warmly tinting my room with a bright orange hue. I rub at my eyes jumping straight from my stiff bed. Pongo jumps in tune with me, ears up, and cuddles close instinctively. I peer across my room at the window facing the forest, the edge of our property line.

All I can see is the fog. It grows thick across the land’s perimeters in a matter of a few blinks, or maybe that’s my poor vision. Right at the point where my parent’s tree stood right at the edge of the woods the fog seeped from the seams of the gapping forest, like how when blood spurts from a wound. The wind blew hard causing a few tree branches to hit my windowpane, knocking me from my stupor. Shaking my head I get out of bed, Pongo jumping off while clinging close to me.

""Come on, time to start the day,"" I whisper, sounding like I’m gargling down gravel as I pull on a fresh pair of overalls. I brush my teeth with a hurried fervor, running down the stairs as delicately as possible, trying with all my might to not wake my grandparents. Pongo's paws are only an arm's length behind me as I hop down the steps.

Reaching the kitchen floor, the cold draft goes right through my overalls. I snatch my cardigan from the coat rack, rushing out through the back door. Leaning against our house a bucket of chicken-feed sat; a red label, *All and Sundry*  plastered across it half haphazardly. I sigh, if only it was closer. With both my bony hands I tightly grip the handle as I struggle to drag it just a few feet across our property. Out of breath and it's barely dawn, Pongo barks at me excitedly wagging his fluffy tail. Through what felt like an ***hour*** I finally drag the heavy container across our property and to the chicken coops’ gate.

“Come on out guys!” I call out to the hens and our good ol’ rooster. We had Lady and Damsel, our beautiful girls, who pecked and hawed as they strutted out of their coop. Richard, the lazy bird swaggering confidently out of the coop last. I walk in, blocking Pongo from following me, sprinkling the red feed distracting them as I gather their eggs from the chickencoop. 

Finding a few and some I might have missed a few days before. I plop them in my basket, leaving the coops trying not to get pecked on my way out of the pen. I make my way back with Pongo at my heels. That’s when I hear a thunderous vroom rumble across the horizon. As if on fire the sparkly, bright red Mustang grinds against the dirt, stirring up a cloud behind its custom wheels. Rock and roll music could be heard loud and clear as it came torpedoing closer. 

I rush past the back door, setting the basket on the kitchen counter as I storm out to the front porch. I grip the banister tight as the red mustang makes a dramatic skidding stop a little too close to our home. If grandpa saw, he’d have a heart attack. Emerging came smoke, then a lanky leg dressed in black leather. His auburn mullet attached to the man’s head was a beacon in the smog. I can see why my Dad called him a bargain-bin rockstar. 

“Hey Uncle Wayne.” I murmur, waving my hand awkwardly as he takes a long drag from his *Camel* cigarette.

Jumping out from the car was a small boy, my little cousin Billy, wearing a sherpa jacket with a pair of robin blue rain boots. His dirty blond head of hair was a mess and his big brown eyes still didn’t fit his head right. His ruddy face and nervous twitching only made him look smaller as he hid behind his Dad’s lanky legs. 

Uncle Wayne throws the cigarette to the ground, grinding it into the gravel path with his snakeskin shoes. “Abbie Ray, yeah? You're taller.” He notes going for another cigarette within a blink. Confused, I stumble over my next few words.

“Uh, you haven’t seen me in over nine years so…” I look at my feet, shoulders tensing, Uncle Wayne takes a long drag leaning against his red mustang. Pretending he didn’t hear me he hops up the porch steps, entering the house as if he owned the place. Confidence seems to be his normal state of being. Billy sticks close behind him pretending to be his father’s shadow’s shadow.

“Grandma and Grandpa haven’t woken up yet.” I remark going inside straight to the kitchen. “Do you want coffee, Uncle Wayne?” 

“Nah, can’t stand the stuff. Can you make me some eggs?” He asks, dropping into the dining chair causing it to creak, straining from the sudden impact. Billy plays with the zipper of his jacket as he sits beside his Father. I nod begrudgingly, not able to hide my pursed lips as I turn around to do what he asked. Grandma always said you had to be a good hostess after all. 

Turning on the stove top while I crack the first egg against the counter top Grandma and Grandpa come down the staircase seemingly in a rush. Grandpa was ready for the morning duties, wearing his usual overalls and work boots but Grandma still wore her fluffy scarlet robe and slippers. I look between Grandpa and Uncle Wayne feeling the tension in the air burning between them like a house made of hay during the dry season.

“You dare show your face here boy.” Grandfather’s dark expression only holds contempt as he glares down at Uncle Wayne. Uncle Wayne took another drag, smoking in the house and ignoring Grandpa’s glare. 

“Henry! Stop, not in front of the kid.” Grandma clenches Grandpa's shoulders tensing at the sight of Billy. She hadn’t seen him just as long as me after all. She was probably itching to pinch his cheeks at this point. 

The only thing you can hear in the room is the whisking of the bowl as I prepped Uncle Wayne’s omelet. Grandpa stone cold silent under Grandma’s obvious duress, glaring at the man lounging at their kitchen table. Grandma takes her hands off his shoulder and slowly walks over to Billy, who seems to just realize he’s the center of attention. I pour the mix into the sizzling pan, my eyes flickering between them.

Grandma sits by Billy warmly smiling at him, while Grandpa in contrast loudly drops into the chair directly across from Uncle Wayne. To glare at him head on I assume. 

“Are you hungry?” Grandma asks Billy, who nods his head enthusiastically smiling, one tooth missing in the front of his wide smile. I quickly set the dishes on the table, interweaving between Grandpa and Uncle Wayne’s glare off. 

“Thank you!” Billy happily scarfed down the scrambled eggs as if it was the first thing he ate in a while. Grandma Cecil pats his back as Billy almost choke in his hurry. 

From my peripheral I could see Uncle Wayne finally putting his cigarette out as Grandpa silently dug into the unsalted scrambled eggs. The more he ground the food in his mouth, the angrier he appeared. Uncle Wayne ignored him, seemingly a skill he had perfected over time. Grandma goes to the mudroom grabbing what looks like a bag of feed from *All and Sundry Co.* She grabs Pongo’s bowl and fills the red pebble like feed to the very top, overflowing. 

“What are you doing?” I ask quickly getting up from my seat to intervene. “We have plenty of dog food left.” I put my hand on hers. Her thin brows scrunch up wrinkling into a glower firmly taking her bony wrist out of my grip. 

“You have some attitude this morning, little lady. We know the quote now don’t we, Abbie Ray? *‘Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others,’* we take these lessons to heart, hm.” Grandma Cecil’s exasperation was leaking off her as she laments. “Now off with you, get the chores done before Grandpa starts toiling.” She starts muttering off about something walking back to the table. 

I grab my plate and quickly drop to Pongo’s level so he could finish it before I dump it into the sink. Readying myself at the door I start dawdling, playing with the buttons of my coat. Pongo sits at my heels looking up at me with a floppy eared head tilt. I press my finger to my lips, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible.

“Why weren’t you at David’s wake?” Grandpa's usually too loud for a house to contain voice is now unsettlingly quiet, the threat clear in his tone. I swallow my tongue, standing still, hoping to blend in with the furniture as his obvious anger simmers. Grandma’s back was turned away from me gently caressing Billy’s hair as he ate unaware of the oncoming argument.

“David and Liz wouldn’t have wanted me there.” Uncle Wayne shrugs, eating the last few bites of his omelet.

“Don’t bring your brother’s wife into this you ingrate. Blaming dead people for your actions, it's disgraceful!” Grandpa bellows out, grandma and I quickly freeze in a state of shock.

“David didn’t call you before that day, now did he?” Uncle Wayne mutters licking his fork, not able to meet Grandpa’s gaze across the table. Grandpa’s hand slams. 

*Whack!* 

The table vibrates from the impact. Grandma and Billy flinch away, Uncle Wayne blatantly ignores it, and I’m a foot closer to the door wishing I had left when I had the chance.

“David didn’t do anything for himself and you knew that, you used his kindness against him! Like how you *always* use the people around you. Bah!” Grandpa guffaws, waving his hand in the air as if that would rid him of Uncle Wayne. Uncle Wayne abruptly stands up from the table shoving the chair backwards with an awkward skid. The phone in his pocket rings. He goes for it, an excuse born from thin air. Maybe pure luck. He rushes past me as if hellfire was burning at his heels. He's out on the front porch clutching his phone tightly like it's his lifeline.

With the door left open in Uncle Wayne’s rush to flee and with my grandparents currently distracted, I make my exit onto the porch with Pongo. There Uncle Wayne whispered into his phone and I can’t help but stop. I quietly step closer to hear what Uncle Wayne is saying. 

“Jessica! No wait, don't hang up…please just take him for one weekend. He’s been asking for you.” I hid behind the miscellaneous tack trunk, trying my best to be sneaky while my forty pound dog was leaning against me the whole time. Hopefully he doesn’t notice his incessant wagging tail. Definitely visible. “You told me you’d see him! You promised me we’d go out as a family. He wants to see his mom—” The other line grows louder and he shrinks back from it as if his eardrums exploded from the volume change. He puts it back to his ear quickly. “Jessica! Jessica!” He repeats the woman’s name over a few times. “Fuck, fucking bitch…” He starts redialing her number putting it back to his ear. From this angle I could see his dark scowl morphing his features into something far crueler than usual calm overly confident demeanor.

“Jessica, your son has every right to see you! If you want to ignore me, fine bitc–uh hum, but don’t ignore our kid.” He grimly murmurs into the phone.  I know now he’s definitely not talking about my parents. I try to sneak onto the porch steps and out of his crosshairs as he screams into the phone once again. My self-preservation kicked in at that very moment.

Too late his dark brown eyes—a similar shade of my father’s beelines straight at me. As if a spotlight was beaming down on my shocked still form. He latches, as quick as a whip, a firm grip wrapped around my small forearm. I wince trying to shake off his painful grip.

“Think you're being sneaky?” Uncle Wayne snickers his grip tightening to a bruising degree.

“I-I’m sorry Uncle Wayne I won’t do it again! I promise I won’t eavesdrop…” I apologize quickly, feeling pain shoot up my arm in waves, getting worse with every passing second. His eyes had this dark cruel glare to them that made him look like he was on the verge of a tirade. He was trembling with unbridled rage, his phone in his other hand, raising it as if ready to strike me like a rattlesnake readying itself to bite. 

In a flash Pongo pounces, biting Uncle Wayne’s arm. Yelping, Uncle Wayne lets me go, almost falling on the wet wooden porch floor. I jump back holding my arm close, wincing in pain. Pongo stands between us getting low on his hind legs, growling and snarling, an obvious warning. Trying to gulp down my fear I try to soothe Pongo petting his soft back over and over. 

“It's okay, Pongo, I’m alright.” I plead to Pongo not wanting to cause any more trouble.

“You're like your mom…” Uncle Wayne snarls while shaking his arm, blood dribbling down from the bite. Waving his pain away as if it didn’t look like a showcase in grime and gore. Pongo bit him so deeply he might need stitches, with the way his forearm looked like my Ma’ undercooked meatloaf. “A troublemaker, just stay out of my way from here on, and keep that mongrel away from me.” Uncle Wayne grumbles a sneer flickering on his snarling face, his auburn goatee residing on his chiseled chin looks extra devilish as he storms away. Probably looking for a first aid kit with the way that bite looked. Apparently not caring if he bumps into Grandpa just as long as he’s far away from me and my ‘mongrel.’

Limping down the front porch steps and trying to shake off the pain of Uncle Wayne’s handprint throbbing on my forearm I make my way to the butcher shed on the side of our house. I pull the hood of my raincoat up, hoping to stay dry. The *All and Sundry* employees put the slop products away in our freezers—apparently it needs to be kept at a specific temperature at all times. 

Opening the shed’s wobbly oak door, it's quite quaint, aside from the massive freezer my Dad invested in a few years back. He loved the art of butchery and thought it was worth every penny, funnily enough Grandpa didn’t argue. As I walked past the butcher station I pointed ignored all the tools and the blood hook attached to the wall. With a wet shiver, I open the alien-like freezer, cold smoke comes out of it in clouds, I struggle to grab one of the many containers lined up inside. 

With a heaving, struggling breath and sore arms, I drag the large bucket across the wooden floor with a loud shriek. Leaving the shed, Pongo barks and jumps the whole time as the bucket lands in the mud with a wet *ka-thud*. 

I stop, my lungs burning, trying to catch my breath and I glare at the Barnhouse knowing it's going to take a time and half to get there. Puffing up my chest and tucking in my chin, I grip the handle tightly in my tiny fist and move with determined steps, digging deep  with each slow step in the thick mud. 

*Caw. Caw.*

I jump, my heart shoots up into my throat, and my eyes see the feathers before finding the crow just a few feet behind me. It was big, no, it was almost as big as me, and its eyes…its eyes gave a dead stare. It didn’t move or fly away, just stared. Slowly taking my eyes off it I see I had dropped the vat, its top popped open and the red slop chunks of processed goo spilled out. I fall to the ground and quickly gather as much of the feed as I can with my bare hands. 

The red slimy–texture like homemade grits as it runs through my hands, struggling to put it back into the large tub.

I drag the container, rushing to the pig’s pen connected to our main stable. Fear makes my heart beat loudly in my ears and as if on auto-pilot I turn my body around–feet dragging in the mud, to see the crow *has* moved closer. It stood above the slop that was left behind in my scramble to flee, picking at the scraps violently, tearing whole into the ground. Gobbling it down, gorging on it so viscously I could see the lumps expand down its large throat.

*Caw. Caw.*

Closing my eyes tight, not caring if I get all the feed into the trough anymore. The red slop plops, slithering out of the bucket with the consistency of sludge, similar to the casserole we ate last night. The red chunks reek of rotten fruit, finally unable to stop myself from gagging at the pungent aroma, I start to dry heave. The smell resembles old roadkill left on a street baking under the hot sun. I stare hypnotized as the pigs come rushing out towards the trough smelling their food even from within the barn.

I look away, unable to look at the pigs engorging on the red slop with an aggressive frenzy resembling a lunch hour at my grandparents’ favorite buffet. Shivering, puckering my lips I shove my nose into my collar, not able to look at their frenzied feeding for any longer. I rush inside the main Barnhouse ignoring the grotesque smell and eerie feeling of the large crow watching my every step.

Right before I close the door I grow brave enough to glance at the crow, and the moment it catches my eyes it looks back directly at me.

*Caw.*

Spewing a large chunk of red goo landing on the ground near my feet with a  *thwack*. Just right before the ugly bird flies off into the grey sky disappearing into the thick fog surrounding our perimeter. Swallowing down my bile, I slam the farmhouse door closed, the wood vibrating under my cold numb hands. Trying to calm my beating heart, I look and see Pongo happily sitting in front of me, wagging his fluffy tail without a care in the world. I laugh, not able to help feeling ridiculous, shaking off the odd occurrence. I move towards Boone’s stall. Pongo follows me close, almost falling into my shoes.

 Absentminded I grab the red hay placing it into Boone’s bucket with my rusting pitchfork. Boone’s large muscular flank turns away and his muzzle goes instinctively towards the food. The toes of his hooves skid against the stall’s straw floor. In his leisurely movements diving his muzzle straight into the bucket to chomp down on the new feed with an asmr like rhythm. I pat his head brushing my fingers into his mane before sighing, knowing I had to put his tack on him soon, I lean against the stall’s gate.

Just as I start to hum a tune I can hear grandfather’s clopping old boots, stomping their way through the barn’s front entrance. His face looks haggard, as if he’s aged another ten years since this morning. His eye bags could be classified as carry on if he ever decided to travel on a plane. Which he never would.

“Go help your grandma with the cows.” He remarks, with a jerk of his finger, as if waving me off as if I was some pest. Grandpa slowly carries Boone’s tack bellowing at the horse all while doing so. “Stupid fucking glue….”  Not wanting to get in his crosshairs I slink out of the stables and head towards the cows’ barn. A crack of a whip is heard and Boone cries out with pained whinny. Grandpa’s yelling was only drowned out by the continuous rain and my steps that distanced me from those horrible sounds.  I continue to drag the bucket of feed to the cows’ Barnhouse, leaving a deep mark in the mud. 

I do a double take, seeing dark feathers appear at the edge of my vision, turning around all while holding my breath reveals nothing but the clear field of un-toiled dirt. I gulp, unable to hold in a hiccup of relief before I turn around, taking the last few steps towards the second Barnhouse where our cattle resided. Entering inside I can already see Grandma hard at work, already milking Brie. With her back turned to me I use the last of the feed, pouring the rest of the red goo into their troughs. 

“You’re late and I’ve already done your job, girl.” Grandma mutters with disdain. Her crackly hands grabbing for the bucket full of milk gesturing for me to take it. “Make yourself useful and take this to the kitchen.” She grumbles,  getting up from the creaky stool with knees that creaked just as loudly. I nod back and forth my red curls bouncing accordingly as I struggle to lift the large bucket with my noodle arms, it sloshes with the gallon of milk.

Getting back to the house, leaving a dent in the damp dirt, since I’m unable to lift anything heavier than an overly buttered biscuit. Knocking the front door open dramatically, Uncle Wayne and Cousin Billy jump in surprise simultaneously. Eyes are as wide as comic strip characters. The kitchen table almost knocked Billy’s untouched breakfast to the floor. 

“Jesus!” Uncle Wayne exclaims loudly smacking his hand on the table with a loud bang. Billy uses the ties of his sherpa jacket to make the hood close in on his face as he burrows into his chair. 

I try to catch my breath, as I take off my muddy boots and drag the bucket into the kitchen, ignoring Uncle Wayne. I can feel his glare burning into the straps of my overalls as I put the milk into glass jugs that were lined up on our marble counters. I do so with a methodical and experienced rhythm, but now apparently we have to put the *All and Sundry* logos on our product.

“Abbie Ray, have you ever heard of manners or did your Daddy forget to teach ya’ that?” Uncle Wayne's deep voice is coated  in condescension from across the room. I freeze still as stone, sticking the last label on the final glass bottle. I gulp down my anger as I put glass jug after glass jug into the square shaped wire container. Blinking repeatedly trying to ignore Uncle Wayne's overly thin eyebrow raised in a high arch, waiting for me to take the bait. Unable to hold it in, I'm about to give a smart aleck reply right before Pongo interrupts with an excited yip. Grandma bursts in soaking wet from the rain that's suddenly starting to pour cats and dogs. 

“Betsy is far along; I think she’s due any day.” Grandma says softly out of breath and whipping her green raincoat off on the old coat rack. Hurriedly putting the wired container of milk into our large fridge I turn back awaiting Grandma’s instructions, used to doing so every night since Ma’s passing. 

“That’s great Grandma! Have you called the vet yet?” I ask while cleaning the countertop in order to start working on dinner. Whatever dinner it may be I’m just glad it's not anymore of those funeral casseroles.  

“Not yet, I’ll call in the morning to give a little update. I think we can handle most of it by ourselves when the calf comes. We’ve handled plenty alone before.” She says softly as she starts rummaging through the fridge. I can’t help but gulp down my thoughts and words, on the edge of blurting out the only reason we're fine without a vet is because Dad and Mom were here helping. But I bite my tongue.

“I can handle dinner dear, now go sit with your cousin and uncle.” She says with a dismissive hand wave before turning our old oven’s countertop on. Feeling my stomach twist uncomfortably I blurt out something before thinking it through.

“I’m actually really tired, if you don’t mind I’d rather go to bed early…” I say immediately, my wide blue eyes flickering between Grandma and Uncle Wayne who looks more pissed off by the moment. I yawn, stretching and bringing my arms up in the air with a  wide motion, Pongo follows my lead with a dramatic yawn himself. 

Grandma looks at me, her eyes trailing over my figure as if I was a runner up pig at the County Fair. I nervously fidget with the frayed edges of my overalls not wanting to look Grandma in the eyes. Grandma nods her head but I can tell she’s disappointed, I turn away, Pongo right on my heels as I head for the stairs.

I close my door and turn the lock with a soft click. Pongo jumps on my bed with not a bit of guilt on his cute face and lolling tongue, drooling a bit. I sigh, changing into my pajamas and jump into my bed and not wishing to move a muscle. Wrapping myself with a blanket I nuzzle into Pongo’s soft furry body which lay beside me in my small twin bed. I take a few deep breaths, my eyelids growing heavy as I fall into a deep sleep for once not thinking about either of my parents. 

“Get up girl!” A blink in a second of time my Grandfather’s gruff voice bellows, vibrating across my room’s thin walls. Its pitch dark outside except for the spare sparkling stars that shimmered past the thick fog.” Go feed the pigs again they already ate through their last feed time…” I catch his disgruntled mumbling at the end feeling oddly confused. Shrugging with a big yawn, Pongo already on the floor excitedly wagging his tail. I get out of bed with another big yawn not bothering to change out of my pajamas as I stumble down the stairs. Everyone was in bed but for grandpa, who was reading a book—I can’t see the title with how dim the light was, as he smoked on his pipe. He didn’t often smoke, knowing Grandma never approved.

Not wanting to dawdle, knowing Grandpa wouldn’t approve of it, I rush to put on my raincoat and boots as I walk out onto the damp front porch. The rain continued to pound on the dirt, the soothing rumbling of thunder was highlighted by the lightning in the distance. When it wasn’t here it was beautiful, but last spring proved thunderstorms to be quite dangerous. We had a willow tree a year ago that fell to the opposite side thankfully from being struck by lightning. If it went the other way it would have destroyed half the house. Grandma always said it was God’s plan. Ma and Pa said they were just thankful we were all okay. 

The cold rain pounded on my already frizzy curls as I stomped into the mud off my front porch, heading to the shed in a half-asleep state. Stepping inside the cold rackety shed I numbly opened the large freezer door, struggling to get another bucket of slop over the large gaping opening of the futuristic freezer. The humid cold fog permeates from the container seeping into my damp curls. 

*Thump* 

*Thump* 

 *Thump* 

The large container’s final thud sloshes into the wet dirt as I drag the container one hurried step at a time towards the pig’s stable. I take in a deep breath, fully awake now the cold rain is pouring hard as the rapids. Drizzling straight down on my vibrant yellow raincoat. I freeze, squinting, my eyelashes clings to thick globs of rain droplets that cloud my vision enough to make me falter in my step. 

Lightning strikes and the silhouette of a crow, not a few feet across the barren muddy field, as large as the scarecrow it looked like. I gasp the thunder loud enough to swallow my voice. I struggle to retighten my hold on the handles of the *All and Sundry* bucket as I hurry my steps to get to the door. The cold rain pounds harder and bites at my pale knuckles making my body feel numb. My eyes flicker back to where I saw the oddly large crow, but the thick darkness and slow thunder rumble didn’t give me any clear view. 

I open the doors quickly, turning the measly old light on and it flickers. My eyes trail down expecting to see sleeping pigs....instead they were huddled together in a tight circle facing away from the pen’s gate and empty trough. A cold chill seeps into my shivering bones as I try to take a silent step forward.

Lighting strikes the ground, the smell of ozone permeating the air around me as I blink to regain my vision. The light bulb pops. Thunder rumbles and the light that encases Pongo and I’s shadows disappear with the light. The pigs that huddled together, their dark silhouette’s turned slowly towards me just as if noticing my presence.

A flash of lighting cracks, thunder booms rumbling the wooden frames, the fog from the open door seeps into the Barnhouse permeating the walls. Their pig snouts move up in the air, as if taking a whiff of the food I brought in. My shivering weak grip falters, already slick with rain water, fingers fumbling at the horrid sudden sight of the lightning spotlights. Their teeth...they were flat and filed down to perfect squares. Just like a human’s smile. They all had these big disgusting grins, unanimously, stretching their fleshy faces wide.

I scream dropping the bucket of feed onto the hay floor running into the night not thinking about anything but getting away. The cold rain pelts down into my very bones as I run, my rain boots stomping into the mud making me sink with each terrified step. Pongo barks running after me cackles raised and teeth flashing at my reaction. Out of breath, the one lamppost still lit on our farm property flickered as if ready to stop working the moment I jumped onto the porch steps.

I slam the front door open swinging back loudly on its unoiled hinges all while I take off my muddy boots. Throwing my raincoat to the floor without a second thought all while I can hear grandmother’s gasp in the background. I ignore my family's silently loud judgement as I run up the stairs, slamming my bedroom door with a good thud. 

Pongo jumps onto my bed still soaking wet from the rain burrowing into the center of my twin bed. I glared at him the whole time I’m struggling to get out of my soaking wet jean overalls, which felt like they weighed over forty pounds. I jump into my bed under my slightly damp covers as if that would protect me from what I saw. My eyes wandered back towards my bedroom window to showcase the night sky. The moon was barely visible under the thick rumbling clouds that spewed bolts of lightning every few seconds.  

The rain continued to belt down and terrorize the dirt. The fog from this morning seems like a wisp to what it was now. Thick clouds greet the earth to submerge our lands without a second thought to who inhabited it. The barely visible lamp post light that held on by inkling of oil now fizzled out and died leaving our land submerged in a thick fog and nothing else. I cling to a wet and panting Pongo, his tongue lolling out as he leaned against me. Rubbing my eyes tiredly as I cling further into his soft damp fur as I try to ignore the wet dog smell. I lean down to pet Pongo’s soft muzzle just as lightning flashes and with a sleepy blink within a moment of time I see human shaped brown eyes on Pongo’s face.

Anime, manga, and video games are no longer niche, they’re spreading overseas, shaping culture, filling Akihabara with tourists hunting rare doujinshi and limited run games. Online forums and imageboards grow crowded, pulling strangers together from Tokyo to California. Connections form in the glow of CRT monitors and net cafés that never sleep. In Sendai, capital of Miyagi Prefecture, this change feels close. The city calls itself the City of Trees, but it's also a city of stories. Sendai Station, rebuilt after the 2005 renovations, is a maze of shops and shinkansen tracks, funneling people from all over Tohoku. School groups chatter over ekiben lunches on the platforms. Salarymen in suits rush for the Yamabiko line to Tokyo.*

*Here in Sendai, whether born here or newly arrived, you’re a student enrolling in senior high school. You join the morning crush at the station gates, swipe your Suica card, catch the Senseki Line. You nod off on the ride, uniform pressed, bag heavy with books. After school there are clubs, cheap family restaurants, purikura photo booths, laughter echoing in the neon lit arcades. Your friends share melon pan and canned coffee under city lights.*

*But beneath the normalcy, you can sense it. Something wrong. Rumors spread online vanishings the police dismiss, crime scenes hidden behind blue tarps, half covered by the polite tone of NHK news broadcasts. A creeping dread pushes through the static of the 2channel threads you read at night.*

*Every day it grows harder to ignore.*

*The cracks spread a little further.*

*Your gut says the world is poised to shatter.*

*As if something malevolent is waking, drawing lines through the pale glass of the world.*

**Character Creation Guidelines**

**Mindset:** *You’ll obtain this over the course of your time as a Sorcerer. It’s shaped by your character’s worldview, whether you’re a cog like Yuji, the Honored One like Gojo, or the Fallen One like Sukuna. Your mindset is unique, which is why progression into it requires time. At character creation, you’ll lay the foundation for it.*

**Aptitudes:** *You'll start with 2 aptitudes of your choice.*

**Skill Points:** *You'll start with 3 SP.*

**Cursed Technique:** *You'll begin with a single CT. We'll work together to design it. If you forgo your CT, you may instead start with one of the following: 3 additional SP, 2 additional aptitudes, or a jujutsu skill of your choice.*

**Binding Vows & Heavenly Restriction:** *While there is no hard limit on these, they must be discussed with me during character creation to determine what is given and what is taken.*

**Gear:** *We'll roll 5d4 × 10 × 10,000 to determine your starting yen. Use this to purchase everything from mundane items to cursed tools and objects as normal.*

**Attributes:** *We'll roll 5 1d4–1s to determine attributes. This system emulates the unfairness of the Jujutsu World. While it may affect your starting power, your endgame potential remains limitless.*

I currently work at a brunch restaurant but the workload is so intense with a line going for many meters on the sidewalk on the weekend and the focus being the brunch food don't feel like I can evolve here. The team is good but its kinda been a nightmare to work there for me. Thats why I've been applying to many coffeeshop and not restaurant. I have had an interview with several coffeeshop but that specific one I want called me for a trial hour where I was with the current barista seeing how it all works and everything went well but the owner wasn't there. Yesterday I went for a second and last trial hour after my regular shift but as I came the owner told me a coffee machine in another shop broke down and he really needed to go and we should reschedule the trial so it would be next week. That has brought me so much anxiety. He told me I could stay if I want with the current barista to do like the other day but I didn't stay cause what's the point if the person actually hiring me is not there? Also I was tired from work... I told him I'm available on Wednesday for the trial but I could have said Monday or Tuesday as these are my days off but my family is coming from far to see me so thats why. I then thought I should have still said we could do trial on Monday or Tuesday. I'm scared another candidate will take my place.. so I sent a message to him last night saying I am available Monday and Tuesday as well but no answer for now. Is it a good sign I will get hired if he asked me to come for a trial hour? Should i have said monday instead of Wednesday? Should I have stayed with the barista to show my interest even if the owner was absent? 
Too much yap I know, just need to get my thoughts off somewhere...I'm not even religious but I've been praying that I get hired. I really feel trapped in my current job :(",1,1751677845.0,barista,3,0.67,False
