1g5ic5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_julylifecoach/comments/1g5ic5i/how_to_make_friends_as_an_adult/,How to make friends as an adult,"Today is Wednesday, the one day I show up to the office. I get to meet my coworkers and have some good old fashioned office conversations. One of my coworkers also went to Amsterdam recently (!!!) and we got to talking about how amazing Amsterdam was (hi if you’re reading this!). I shared my plans to potentially move to Europe in the next decade and what life would look like there, and we discussed wonderful food and the art scene in Amsterdam along with what we missed about the place.

Then my coworker, who I’ll refer to as a friend going forward, asked me if we have some connections or people we know in Europe. We know 0 people in Europe but that’s not a problem because even when we decided to move to the U.S. after getting married in Korea, we knew 0 people! I think what allows for this to work for us in particular is I have a lot of experience going around places without prior connections because of college, grad school, then an extended period of business trips where I just stayed in hotels and such. My wife, while she hasn’t had that kind of life where she travels long distances like me, is a very independent person who always is in pursuit of self-reliance and independence as a core value. So put the two of us together and you can throw us anywhere in the world, we’ll make it work.

As I was explaining this I expressed it this way in person: “we both don’t like people”. So this can come as a surprise because I’m someone who has a business working with people. It’s not that I’m engaging in my business begrudgingly while hating everybody else; it’s more like I don’t seek people and go out of my way to meet and talk to them. My natural preference is to be alone and reflect with writings like this and enjoy solitary time meditating or playing video games. Other people have different natural preferences like wanting to go out and mingle and such; this is just a personality trait of mine, being introverted and all.

Then my friend asked, how do you have social relationships when you don’t seek people? I somewhat talk about this topic all the time but I don’t think I’ve actually prepared a comprehensive answer to this, which makes me wonder why I didn’t yet because I get this question literally all the time from online audiences. So let’s break down how I think about friendships and relationships.

# People are everywhere

Every day I encounter my freedom at 5AM. My wristband vibrates and I’m faced with the first opportunity of freedom: I *could* go back to sleep and not bow. But with my freedom I wake up and start bowing. Why? Because it’s good for me. It’s how I use my free time. After that I encounter my freedom again, and I use my freedom to walk my dogs. Again, why? Because walking them is way better than having to clean pee and poo at home and I want my dogs to enjoy smelling and marking things outside. And from then it’s a continuing sequence of me using my freedom to my advantage.

It’s all about me. I care about what I want to do with this time. And as I go about doing this, I encounter many people. When I walk my dogs I meet my neighbors. When I go to work I run into many coworkers. When I write and publish things or write on social media I run into people who like and write comments on my posts. Even if I live in the secluded woods I’d probably meet the mail person in this day and age.

I don’t exist in a vacuum. I’m always surrounded by people and even when I want to avoid people there is always a potential to meet another person. Even when I lock myself in a labyrinth what stops an urban explorer from just entering my labyrinth? I learned this the hard way, by being a misanthrope. I spent so much time being lonely in my early 20’s then the loneliness turned into a kind of resentment. When I started resenting people instead of wanting them every opportunity to meet a person became a stressful possibility. I spent my entire day being stressed because I couldn’t tell when I would run into another human being.

(when I share this part about myself people are always surprised by it, which surprises me; I still think this part of me is pretty obvious from the outside)

So this is a classic case of a reframing. If people are going to be everywhere regardless of whether I want to or not, what’s more enjoyable for me: hating people or at least being neutral with people? I got to a place of being neutral with people first. I’m not arguing that it is literally impossible to be completely alone. There are people who die in solitude and hikikomoris who lock themselves up in their computer dungeons. What I’m saying is, as long as you’re alive the possibility to interact with another human being is never zero. Even the people who die in solitude eventually get found because of worrying neighbors or EMT’s doing wellness checks. Hikikomoris who lock themselves up still need to provide sustenance for their lives, which they usually don’t do by self-farming.

# Loneliness is me being closed

So by this point I have recognized that I am part of a connected universe and the potential and possibility for a human connection is always nonzero. So what do I do with the connections that sporadically transpire? That is up to me. I could say hi and just continue going my way. I could stop for a bit and ask how they’re going. I could punch them. I could spank their ass. In the face of infinite possibilities again I choose something that’s good for me, which is variable depending on the situation. For example while I love talking to my neighbor Matt who has a wonderful dog named Scruffy, if I’m in a hurry to get home because I just remembered I’m simmering some curry and I forgot to turn off the stove I’m gonna have to say hi and run back home. But other times I could stop and have a chat about how the neighborhood is going.

This freedom and ability to choose, I think, is ultimately what is under-recognized and undervalued in general. If I’m to make a bold generalization I think every personal problem is a problem related to under-recognition of what it means to be a free human being. You don’t always HAVE to engage with people in the same way. You always have a choice in striking up a conversation that’s just one level deeper than the ones you’re used to having.

Then I get this question: how do I know what to talk about, how do I organically form the deeper relationships? This isn’t really a technique thing or a strategy thing but just a general human experience kind of thing. But in this day and age we like to hack and optimize everything to minimize our chances of error (especially if you have cringe-worthy errors that keep haunting you). Here’s how I like to look at depths of social relationships.

In a 1:1 conversation, either party can:

1. Talk
2. Listen
3. Ask

This writing is an example of me just talking. You didn’t really ask for me to talk, but here I am talking. But you always have the option of pressing “back” and stop reading; the same applies to conversations. If you don’t want to have a conversation you can always stop and walk away. What if I became hyperconscious of your possibility of leaving this writing? Then I would need to fawn and cater to what you might be interested and I won’t really be talking about the things I want to talk about, the things that excite me.

Here’s what we’re comparing. Me passionately talking about something that genuinely excites me and interests me, while being open to the possibility of you not being interested in hearing it vs. me constantly monitoring whether it seems like you’re interested in the conversation or not and trying to figure out on the fly what to talk about next to keep you engaged. Which version of Billy would you find it easier to talk to? I’d argue that it’s the first one.

Why this is important is, suppose we only said hi a few times before. But what if I suddenly open up a deep conversation about what I think the meaning of life is during a coffee chat? Does it have the possibility to invite a wtf reaction? Yes. But here’s the thing: is any other topic immune to that possibility? No. This doesn’t mean every topic is the same, for example certain topics are more divisive and incendiary in nature like racial politics and geopolitical conflicts. Certain topics are known to be more casual like pop culture and coffee/drink preferences. It’s about figuring out where you want to navigate in terms of that relationship. If you want to take a chance at deepening a relationship, you take a chance at a deeper conversation (whatever the metric of deep means). Let me explain with an example.

I had a client who was a self-made options trader (hi if you’re reading this!). They were very well versed in personal finance and investment without relying on big trading firms. I actually happen to be interested in advocating for more financial literacy in young people, and when I learned that my client had these abilities I had the choice in taking a chance at this new conversation topic. “What do you think about financial literacy in the United States at this current time? I’m asking because I think …”. This context is a good indicator that talking about financial literacy in society, which might be a hard topic for a casual encounter, can be an easy topic at this time because I have a vested interest in it and they’re an expert in the field.

The friend who I talked to at work is interested in sustainability and eco-friendly practices. So to them asking why sustainability matters to them and providing my critiques of current capitalist practices that do not prioritize nature is an easy topic while it might be a hard topic for my jiu jitsu teammate after a hard roll. But to the jiu jitsu teammate talking about what true strength is in a man is an easy topic compared to talking about that with a coworker I’ve only met in work meetings.

The important thing is I always have a choice to go one level deeper. If I don’t want to for whatever reason I don’t have to. But if I always default to not opening up, then I leave the depth of the relationship to other people. Do I want to leave the experience of my life to other people? Do I want to constantly use other people to make me happy and do I always want to blame other people for making me sad? These questions aren’t directed at you to make you feel bad, these questions are actually what kicked me out of my closed heart phase.

I can’t emphasize this enough. I hated people. And I was miserable for it. All the hate I harbored for people never did one thing to make them have a miserable time, never did a single thing to punish them. It was a poison that just hurt me and nobody else. I went from that and loving conversations with people and I would never go back to hating people because I still remember how horrible it feels to harbor hate for another person.

# Relationships aren’t just with people

To summarize, there are always people around you regardless of what you do with your life and there is always an opportunity for you to open yourself up for a chance to deepen a relationship. If they don’t like you, that’s fine; there’s more people in the world. For every person unsubscribing from my writings there’s a new person subscribing, in fact there are more people who subscribe than the people who unsubscribe and that’s why the total number of people in my email list is nonzero. Same with my YouTube channel. For everybody who unsubscribes there’s more people who subscribe. I’m not going to spend time with people who hate me not because I hate them back; it’s more because I’m doing them a disservice with my presence and I want happiness for them even if their version of happiness doesn’t include me.

But I want to conclude this writing with this important point. Relationships aren’t just with people. People are a subcategory of things. There are always things you are connected with. For example the hiking trail that you walk, that is something you can have a relationship with. You can love it one percent more than yesterday by cleaning up the trash you encounter. By advocating for more light and dog poop bags. Your office building, you can have a relationship with and you can love it a little more than yesterday by offering to stock coffees from the drawer and cleaning the fridge when you see it’s dirty.

Feel the connection with the world you live in, and open your heart into it. I think that is the most underrated piece of wisdom when it comes to loneliness and relationships.

He said that he feels that things are just not working out, he felt like he didn't love me anymore, and he needs time to work on himself. I can acknowledge that we definitely have our differences, I am a more romantic person while he is stoic and emotionally pretty reserved. I would find faults in him and make comments about how I wished he could buy me flowers, constantly hinting at how I wished he would touch me more/ be affectionate, yada yada. I would always ask him things like ""do you really love me?"" ""do you love me as much as you did in the start?"" just to selfishly get reassurance, or an ego boost,  even though he would always say ""yes, obviously."" I guess I didn't realise how all this questioning must have weighed him down, maybe made him question it himself. 

For context, he moved to my home country to be with me after only knowing eachother for a few months. Those first months were truly AMAZING and I felt like this man was absolutely it for me. He was so romantic, so affectionate, the sex was incredible and he said that he had opened up to me in ways he never had before. I have never been happier in my life. We've been through a LOT since he moved to my country and I feel like I've had to kind of look after him while he found his feet. He has struggled a bit to fully settle and I can see that he had been getting more and more homesick, especially after he went home by himself for a short visit. I've felt immense pressure to be enough for him and I think all this stress and my fears over him deciding to leave have turned me into someone I'm not proud of. By nature,  I have a very sarcastic and 'teasy' sense of humour, and whenever he would say something like ""hey, i don't really like that""or ""it doesn't make me feel good when you say that"" I would deflect and say something like ""oh sweetheart, you know I didn't mean it like that"" or try to tell him that it didn't mean anything bad and I'm just a jokey kind of person. I wish now that instead of defending myself I would have just said ""ok, I see it differently but I will stop"". He is quite sensitive and I think has a lot of childhood trauma from bullying, etc. I am so angry at myself because I know that my comments and my nagginess and nitpicking about aspects of his personality are what ultimately pushed him away. He mentioned a few times that he'd been having doubts for a while about the future and I could feel him withdrawing from me emotionally, physically and sexually which has only made my behaviour worse as I demanded more and more from him in an effort to try and get some reassurance and convince myself he wasn't going to leave. 

In saying that, I would say I've been a pretty good partner to him. I'm patient, always ask him about his day, make him a coffee every single morning even when he works earlier than me, initiate sex regularly, and buy him random gifts all the time. I offer him massages when he's had a tiring day at work without expecting or asking for one in return, and most of all I have gone above and beyond to integrate him into my family and friend groups to make sure he felt welcomed in this new country. Whenever I've tried to get him to vocalize anything he feels I could improve on he has nothing to say. 

It is SO hard to grapple with the fact that he came to this country with dreams about how amazing his new life would be with me, only to find out that I am actually full of flaws and he fell out of love. If he ever gave me a second chance I would do anything to prove to him that I am willing and able to work on myself and I would always listen to anything he says that bothers him. He is the sweetest boy I think I will ever meet, with absolutely no flaws except that he struggles with affection and expressing his feelings. We aligned in every other way and even though I did let him know the things I wanted him to work on, I was never ever going to give up on him or leave him because he was always enough. I hate myself for destroying this boy's perception of me, maybe of love in general. I truly never ever wanted to hurt him and I wish I could go back to all the stupid things I said and just do better. 

I feel like it's probably too late and the damage is done, he most likely completely resents me and certainly wouldn't want to stay in my country anymore as he has said before that I was the only thing keeping him here. I am frightened that I will never see him again and I will regret for the rest of my life the ways in which I contributed to the death of this relationship. How do I stop hating myself?

* Mari Sølv is a Snow Leopard Faunus who is 39 Year Old.  Aura is great for anti-aging right?

* She was born in the same town that her children were born in.

* She has a Human brother as her father is a Human.

* While she was born near Argus, she is a graduate of Atlas Academy and a Huntress who specialises in CQC-B.

* She met her husband in Atlas as he is a Faunus born there.  In fact, she and her husband run a successful agriculture business specialising in coffee and tea.  This is why her appearance is well off.

* Due to her tail, it is borderline impossible to knock her off balance.

* In this timeline, she is an old acquaintance of Ozpin and met him when they were in their early twenties.  She is a member of his Brotherhood and helps financially backs their operation alongside acting as an arbitrator when they must discuss important notions.

* Her Allusion is Gugu but with key differences. 

—Gugu is a Yellow Leopard while Mari is a Snow Leopard.

— Gugu can transform into a woman but their form is a ‘fat little Gillikin’.  Mari is tall and visibly ‘mature’ instead.


* She has made it abundantly clear to Ozpin that getting her children involved in their shadow war will be an immediate dealbreaker and will result in her resigning.  She especially is concerned about her son due to his right eye.

* The necklace on her tie is why Ozpin sought her out.

* Her appearance is based on Fate’s Leonardo Da Vinci.  To be exact, she is based on Da Vinci’s Caster role.

So, guess what’s quietly heating up while the world’s too busy obsessing over windmills and solar panels? That’s right—volcanoes. Since 2020, geothermal energy from volcanic regions has been slowly bubbling under the surface (pun intended). And trust me, the molten future is piping hot. I’m here to explain why volcanoes are your new best investment buddies and how you can ride this magma wave straight to the top.

What is Geothermal Energy? (Or as I like to call it, ""Earth Juice"")

Let’s break it down. Geothermal energy is essentially Earth's way of brewing an endless pot of coffee. Deep underground, the Earth’s core is so hot it makes summer in Death Valley look like a cool breeze. And guess what? If you stick a giant straw (aka a drilling rig) into the Earth near a volcano, you can sip on that sweet, renewable energy. Think of volcanoes as nature’s version of nuclear power—minus the whole ""radioactive meltdown"" thing.

Volcanic regions like Iceland, Hawaii, and parts of the U.S. are sitting on giant untapped batteries, just waiting to be plugged into. All we have to do is punch a few holes into the ground and siphon that spicy magma heat.

Why Volcanoes are the Next Big Thing

Forget uranium. Who needs radioactive rocks when you’ve got freaking volcanoes ready to spew energy 24/7? You think your fancy solar panels work at night? Nope. But volcanoes don’t take breaks. They’ve been churning out heat since the dawn of time, and they’re not about to stop because of a cloudy day.

Volcanic geothermal energy is baseload power, which means it’s reliable—something the wind can’t claim, no matter how hard it blows. And in the age of “net-zero by 2050” pledges, countries are desperately looking for ways to power their TikToks without melting the polar ice caps. That’s where our fiery friends come in.

Supply? Oh, It’s Hot

Here’s the thing: drilling into a volcano to harness its heat isn’t exactly like tapping a keg. It takes serious cash, cutting-edge tech, and a willingness to risk pissing off whatever ancient lava gods live down there. But once you’ve got your geothermal plant up and running, it’s like having a money printer powered by the Earth’s molten core.

Countries like Iceland have already figured this out. They’ve turned their entire island into a giant hot tub, using geothermal energy to power just about everything. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is sitting on top of potential volcanic gold mines, too distracted by wind farms to notice.

But hey, no rush. You’ve got time. It only takes about 10-15 years and a few billion dollars to build a geothermal plant. No big deal, right? But once it’s up, it’s like owning the ultimate energy cheat code: clean, renewable power that never sleeps. Good luck getting that from your fancy lithium-ion batteries.

Demand? It’s Erupting

The world’s hunger for clean energy is growing faster than a viral cat video. Everyone from the U.S. to China is scrambling to figure out how to keep the lights on without boiling the oceans. Right now, we’ve got about 60 geothermal plants globally. But with over 300 in the proposal stage, things are about to heat up—literally.

Volcanic regions are the VIP sections of this energy party. Countries sitting on the Pacific Ring of Fire—like Japan, Indonesia, and parts of the U.S.—are realizing they’ve got a front-row seat to the next energy revolution. They just need to stop obsessing over their oil and gas addictions long enough to look down and realize they’re sitting on the world’s largest underground furnace.

Investment Ideas: Volcanoes Are the New Uranium

You’ve got two options here. One, you can keep investing in old-school energy sources like uranium and coal, hoping they’ll somehow make a comeback like vinyl records. Or two, you can get in on the ground floor of geothermal energy before everyone realizes they’ve been sleeping on volcanoes.

Companies like Ormat Technologies (ORA) are leading the charge in geothermal energy production. And if you want to hedge your bets on the entire clean energy sector, the Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW) is an option—if you like boring, diversified investments. But the real action is going to be in companies brave enough to punch a few holes into the Earth near volcanoes and start sucking up that sweet, sustainable magma juice.

Conclusion: Volcanoes for the Win

So, while everyone else is talking about wind and solar, just remember: volcanoes are the OGs of energy. They’ve been here since the Earth was born, and they’re not going anywhere. Geothermal energy from volcanic regions is clean, reliable, and—let’s face it—way cooler than uranium. We’re heading into a future where volcanoes might just power your home, your car, and your ridiculous collection of smart gadgets.

In conclusion, the next time someone asks you about your energy investments, just tell them you’re going all-in on volcanoes. They’ll laugh—until you’re sitting on a mountain of cash powered by molten rock.

In 2022, my girlfriend and I broke up, during which she dated a guy named 'Z' briefly after being introduced through a mutual friend.

We got back together in 2023, but she has continued to communicate with 'Z' due to their shared circle of friends. She mentioned this to me, but I wasn’t aware of the extent of their interactions. When I expressed my discomfort with their communication, she reassured me that they’re just friends and that this is her primary way of socializing while working from home and on a night shift. She also pointed out that I don’t have much time for her because I'm busy with work and law school.

'Z' is a seafarer who recently returned to the country. Recently, they went to a mountain resort with a group of friends. While looking through pictures and videos, I noticed that only the two of them were walking together, admiring the views, while the others were elsewhere. When I asked to see their messages, I discovered that they chat almost every day, often through voice messages and calls. I also noticed some advances he made, which he passed off as jokes, and my girlfriend laughed them off. She attended his birthday without informing me, where he jokingly introduced her as his girlfriend to his family. Additionally, they’ve had coffee together twice with the same group of friends, and he has picked her up from her house.

I want to be understanding, but I can’t overlook that she went to his birthday and had coffee with him without letting me know.

Another important point is that my girlfriend and I started dating while she was in a relationship, which makes me wonder if the dynamics could be similar this time around.",2,1729136468.0,OffMyChestPH,4,0.67,False

(Scene 2: \*\*INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY\*\*)  



\*A group of high-powered executives sits at a long conference table. Suddenly, the frog \*\*smashes\*\* through the window and flies across the room.\*  



\*\*EXECUTIVE 1:\*\*  

What was that?  



\*\*EXECUTIVE 2:\*\*  

It was... destiny.  



\*The frog circles the conference room once, knocks over a water pitcher, and shoots back out the window.\*  



\*\*FROG:\*\*  

(Still flying)  

BEEP BEEP! RIBBY RIBBY!  



---



(Scene 3: \*\*EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT\*\*)  



\*The frog lands in a shadowy alley, breathing heavily. A larger, intimidating frog steps out from the shadows—he’s wearing a leather jacket and smoking a tiny frog-sized cigarette.\*  



\*\*BIG FROG:\*\*  

(Grinning)  

You think you can just jet around my city, kid?  



\*The tiny frog doesn't respond—he just \*\*powers up the jetpack\*\* and blasts off again, narrowly avoiding Big Frog's \*\*amphibious fist.\*\*\*  



\*\*BIG FROG:\*\*  

(Yelling after him)  

This ain't over, Ribby!  



---



(Scene 4: \*\*INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT\*\*)  



\*The frog flies through an open subway door and zips through the car, bumping into passengers. A man spills his coffee. An old lady shrieks in delight.\*  



\*\*OLD LADY:\*\*  

Ribbit on, little guy!  



\*\*FROG:\*\*  

(Confident)  

BEEP BEEP! RIBBY RIBBY!  



---



(Scene 5: \*\*EXT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MIDNIGHT\*\*)  



\*The frog hovers at the top of the Empire State Building, staring at the \*\*full moon\*\*. His jetpack sputters—it’s running out of fuel. He looks down at the glowing city below.\*  



\*\*FROG:\*\*  

(Quietly, to himself)  

Ribby ribby...  



\*And with that, the jetpack gives out, and the frog \*\*free-falls\*\* toward the street below. But just as he’s about to hit the ground—\*  



\*\*FROG:\*\*  

(Screaming)  

BEEP BEEP RIBBY RIBBY!!!  



\*The jetpack roars to life, blasting him back into the sky, free and unstoppable.\*

\*\*THE END... OR IS IT?\*\*

My husband and I have been TTC for almost 2.5 years now. I’ll be 35 in November and my husband is 36. Earlier this year I got bloodwork done and an ultrasound done to count how many eggs I have left. My husband also got a SA done. According to my Dr. my numbers and counts are great and my husbands SA was decent. Not great, but not the worst. 

I track my cycle, test for ovulation, take a prenatal etc. I just feel that after 2.5 years that I should have had at least one faint positive, but nothing. I try not to worry too much during the TWW, which as I’m sure yall know isn’t the easiest thing to do. I find myself adjusting my life style depending on where I’m at in my cycle. TWW, let’s drink decaf coffee, no alcohol or baths. But when my period starts, I’ll start all that again. 

It’s starting to get to my head and affect my mental health. I want to be more consistent with my workouts and get back to feeling confident in myself again but I’m so afraid of pushing too hard and losing something I didn’t even know I had. 

It’s so hard to get out of my own head most days. Do I “sacrifice” my confidence and mental well being for the small chance that I might get pregnant by not doing those things? Or do I say I am important too and need to be taken care of.

Notable characters: there was a waitress that you played as in each level who runs around the kitchen to make coffee and croissants and stuff

Notable gameplay mechanics: you tapped the screen where you want the character to go. You had to do the objectives to pass the level, and I distinctly remember a Halloween event where you played as a witch and all the food was Halloween themed. The characters would leave if you took too long to fulfill their order and you could upgrade your bakery to make them stay happy longer.

Other details: the character you play as runs around the kitchen to fulfill orders and has to actually use the recipe book to make things, like croissants, with eggs and flour and stuff. The customers sit at the counter and will get mad if you take too long, and the food can burn or the coffee can overflow. You could also see the entire kitchen and the counter at once, there was no switching sections or anything. It was like you were staring in from the ceiling and observing the whole bakery at once if that makes sense?",1,1729135657.0,tipofmyjoystick,1,1.0,False

We are a young couple spending three months in NYC. The first two months we're staying in Midtown. We love it already; been here since the beginning of October.

Where should we stay for the month of December? 

We like to eat out, go on for walks, have good coffee shops nearby.

What are top recommended neighborhoods?

1g5hlb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1g5hlb4/advice_falling_asleep_during_flights/,Advice: Falling Asleep During Flights ,"While I spend most of my time helping people get better sleep, meaning not staying up at night worrying or fighting, I do spend a good amount of time flying to visit clients and have noticed how some people struggle to sleep during a flight. 
So I’ve pulled together a few bits of advice on how to sleep when traveling via the air. 
As always, if you need help falling asleep due to worry or stress, I’m happy to talk. 

Here’s advice on how to fall asleep during a flight:

Dear Weary Traveler,

Falling asleep during a flight can be tricky, but with the right techniques, you can drift off and arrive at your destination feeling refreshed. Here are five tips to help you catch some Z’s while up in the air:

1. Prepare Your Environment:**
   - Bring a Neck Pillow: Supporting your neck will help prevent discomfort and allow your head to rest in a natural position. Invest in a quality neck pillow to avoid waking up with a stiff neck.
   - Use an Eye Mask: The bright cabin lights or sunlight can make it hard to relax. An eye mask blocks out light and helps signal to your body that it’s time to rest.

2. Use Noise-Canceling Headphones or Earplugs:
   - Airplane noise can be disruptive, whether it’s the hum of the engine or the chatter of fellow passengers. Noise-canceling headphones or simple earplugs can create a quieter environment, making it easier to fall asleep.

3. Skip the Caffeine and Alcohol:
   - While it might be tempting to grab a coffee or have a drink before your flight, caffeine and alcohol can interfere with your ability to sleep. Opt for water or herbal tea instead to stay hydrated and promote relaxation.

4. Get Comfortable with Your Seat Position:
   - Recline your seat if possible, and make sure you’re comfortable before trying to fall asleep. Adjust your seatbelt so it’s snug but not restrictive, and use a blanket or scarf to stay warm.

5. Practice Relaxation Techniques:
   - Use deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation to calm your body and mind. Close your eyes and take slow, deep breaths, focusing on relaxing each part of your body from head to toe. This can help signal your brain to wind down and prepare for sleep.

A Thought to Sleep On:

Sleep on a flight doesn’t always come easily, but with the right preparation and mindset, you can create a peaceful environment that helps you relax and drift off. Remember, a little preparation goes a long way when it comes to getting rest in the sky.

Wishing you restful travels and peaceful sleep,

One night, I was on a coffee shop, nagopen ako ng app to check if there's someone who wants to join for coffee and a possible hook up since day off ko pa kinabukasan.. One profile caught my attention, ""LF Chubby"" pero walang profile photo. I took my chance ( as a chub guy) and invited him to coffee it was a long convo but managed to invite him for coffee kahit kakauwi nya lang daw (also he agreed to trade albums) and sobrang cute na cute ako sa kanya hahaha.

He insisted to pay, kahit willing naman ako na magbayad kasi ako ang nag invite.He paid for the pastries and coffee, we ate in silence first but as the night progresses we managed to open up some facts about ourselves, me as a closeted part of a broken family, him as a closeted working student.

I was surprised nung sumandal sya bigla sa balikat ko, hindi kasi ganon ang experience ko before lalo na at di pa naman out, more importantly ay nasa public place kami na maraming tao. After that, we exchanged socials tho IG palang naman. We finished our coffee then hinatid nya ako sa bahay. We chatted for a while na nakauwi na sya, then sa said our goodnights. It was okay kahit walang hookip na nangyari, minsan kasi talaga may makaka meeet sa g-app na wholesome moment, and I was not expectimg na mag memessage pa sya since wala naman kami ganap. 

I was surpised again the next day na nag good morning sya. Althroughout the day magkachat lang kami, although late replies kami parehas since may event sya sa school, ako naman bonding with my cousins as I was visiting them. I tried to invite him again for dinner, but said ""kelan kaya yung cuddle"" and I said I have no place neither did he. So we opt to talk about hotels/motels near us just to cuddle, sana. 

FF, we decided to meet up and found one nearby motel na 400 pala ang 3hrs? Nagulat naman ako hahahaha, as usual he paid for it, na medyo kinainis ko kasi, pwede namang hati kami. We entered the motel (airconditioned naman) and we started to cuddle, after few minutes, he said na tinitigasan na daw sya sakin. Aba ineng, ay kabado na ako. Things escalated so fast, he managed to undress me in seconds and he softly asked if okay lang ba na handjob ko daw sya, bilang marupok, ginawa ko followed by sucking him. Basta we did 2 rounds of it, and both times bilis nya labasan dahil in his words ""ang init daw ng bibig ko"". Parang 1hr pa remaining time, we just talked about life. We checked out then dumaan kami 711, admnd he bought me ice cream kasi daw baka napagod ako. 

Up to this day, magka chat pa din kami, and update update lang sa life. 🫣

P.S. magkikita ulit kami mamaya coz day off ko na bukas and nag aaya sya dinner daw. (Baka sya ang kainin ko, eme)",9,1729135181.0,phlgbt,6,0.91,False
1g5hj91,https://www.reddit.com/r/4tran4/comments/1g5hj91/cute_crush_on_guy_friend/,Cute crush on guy friend ❤️ 😍 ,"About a year or two ago, I used to live with a guy, let’s call him jack. I came out as trans while we were roommates and he was instantly supportive. We started hanging out more often, playing video games and stuff like that, and eventually he became my best friend (he didn’t see me the same way but that was ok). 

my transition started to take its toll on my sexuality and I became primarily attracted to men. I started taking progesterone and got my horny back, and after living together for two years, jack was my first real crush on a man. 

I graduated from college, and couldn’t make myself pursue the career I had been training for. I kind of just gave up, I was burnt out, depressed, and unemployed. I had unlimited free time. I cleaned and decorated the apartment more often, started getting really into cooking, which naturally led me to share meals with him. We started eating dinner together regularly, cooking for each other and going out to eat about once a week. I cooked most of the time, it was a way for me to show affection and I had the free time to put a lot of effort into it. We often went on walks to the coffee shop around the corner, we went grocery shopping together. I was lonely, and I’ll admit that I convinced myself we were in a closer relationship than we actually were. I purposefully chose to do things with him that felt like “dates” or things couples do, and he didn’t mind because he liked hanging out with me. 

We were drunk at a Halloween party and we held hands at the party, and I held onto his arm as we walked home. I remember thinking it was romantic, this was the moment we would kiss and start dating and everything would be ok. But nothing happened.

A few months go by and I start feeling intensely suicidal, as most trans people do, about not passing and failing my career and being terminally unemployed. Around this time I also started to escalate the flirting. I bought cute pajamas to wear around the house, started getting him to watch movies with me so I could rest my head on his shoulder or his lap. I got very clingy, and this relationship was the only thing keeping me going. 

Eventually, things reached a breaking point. We were out at dinner, and I wanted to wear his jacket. Jack gave me this look, uncomfortable and dismissive. He told me to take it off. When we got home, I broke down crying and told him about my crush. Jack said he knew, but he had just thought of me like his little sister, and he wasn’t attracted to anyone other than his GF. I told him we had to stop cuddling and going out to eat.

The next week was hell. I realized how profoundly lonely and empty my life had become, and without him there was nothing left. As far as I could tell I had no one in my life. ( I wish I had just reached out to an old friend or my family or anything ). I spent every hour of every day battling suicidal thoughts. Not about him rejecting me - about everything in my life and what it had become, how pathetic I felt I was. His girlfriend came to visit (she lives a few states away) and I couldn’t bear to look her in the eye. For another week things got progressively worse. 

I attempted suicide. I won’t tell this part of the story In detail. But Jack was there for it and he saved my life. The next morning I moved in with my parents and started therapy, started rebuilding my life. For a few months, we tried having a more healthy friendship, but it was never the same. Later on he told me the event was traumatic for him and he could never live with me again. We eventually stopped texting each other - he never said he wanted to be left alone but it’s been over a year no contact. 

I wanted to format this into a cute green text where I almost get boyremoved by my straight roommate, but WOw this got long and sad. 

I still feel so terrible about what I did to him. People I told about this don’t think I was wrong, but I know deep down there was something really wrong with how I acted. Maybe I didn’t mean to hurt him, but I did. 

Being trans is the loneliest thing I have ever experienced. Attempting to date men sucks. I keep getting crushes on guy friends. Ugh. 

I managed to dig myself out of the hole I was in and turned my passion for cooking into a career. A solid 95% of those really dark thoughts are gone now. 

>TLDR 
-Be me
-Come out to roommate, he’s supportive
-Become best friends
-Get super depressed, lonely, and horny
-Start hanging out all the time, acting like his GF
-Cooking for him, cleaning, etc. all out of love
-He has a GF
-We go on dates every week, cuddle watching movies,
-Hold hands one time
-wish he would just boyremove me already
- I tell him how I feel
-Rejected :(

He asked me to meet him for coffee today because “he had to see me”.  Against my better  judgement I agreed - mostly because I was curious to hear what he had to say. 

I asked him to please let me know if he would be late ( he is never on time) and he promised he would. Of course, I arrive on time and no Q. I call to ask where he is and he informs me that he’s an hour away. He didn’t bother to call, text, nothing. When I asked why, his response was “that’s just me. It’s how I am” in the most callous, uncaring tone.

I hung up and left feeling so angry at myself and so so stupid for giving him yet another opportunity to disappoint me. But I’m glad it happened because it was the final confirmation I needed that I did the right thing by breaking up with him, but obviously I was hurt.

1g5hght,https://i.redd.it/ujp3ybeeh8vd1.jpeg,My Wicked Cup Story,"These are my first Stanley cups and I was 100% drawn in by the Wicked theme. I managed to get Ginda when she was restocking on and off on the website yesterday. I can't believe she arrived one day later!  I really did want both, but color wise I do prefer the pink. However, character wise the Elphaba  cup is just so perfectly ""Wicked"" that I was really hoping I would be able to get her too. 

I noticed Glinda was restocking fairly often online throughout the day (and being sold within milliseconds), but never saw Elphaba come back in stock at all.  My sister wanted both as well, but she wanted Elphaba the most so we were both checking obsessively hoping one of us would catch them in stock. 

When I woke up this morning I checked the website and no luck. So I made my coffee and sat down and started drinking it and reading my book. Then my sister calls and is like ""omg, Elphaba is showing in stock at our local Target! Can you go?!"" She has 3 kids and lives like 25 minutes away from Target, whereas I'm like 5 min away and don't have kids. 

So I literally jumped up, threw on a random dress I could pull over my head quickly, ran a brush through my hair, and ran out the door. No shower, no makeup, I hadn't even brushed my teeth yet 😱😅

I got there at just before 8:30am and found the endcap that the app was telling me they were located. The Wicked poster was up (it was not there yesterday when I went looking) but the shelves under it were completely empty.  I started working up the courage to try to ask an employee (yay, social anxiety), but then I heard one of them reading off the dpci over the walkie. So I went up to her and said ""excuse me, are you checking for the Wicked cups? Because I'm looking for them too if you have any.""  She says yes and asked me how many, so I asked for one for me and one for my sister if possible. 

Someone walkied back and said there was a box of them still sitting on the U-boat in the backroom, so the lady that was helping me said she'd go back and grab them.  She came out with the box and they were still individually wrapped in their shipper boxes with tissue paper. She cut the tape on the boxes, so they could easily be taken out and scanned, but she let me keep the boxes for protection.  

A few hours after getting safely home with mine and my sisters Elphabas my Glinda arrived a day earlier than expected, I was so excited!  My sister was able to get a Glinda online last night too, so it should be arriving soon.  I'm so glad we were each able to get both of the cups and it was a fun and exciting hunting experience that we could share. 💕 💚 

PS. I'm kinda hoping to find a Glinda tumbler at some point so I can use it for coffee, but if it's not possible I'm very satisfied with what I did get.  ",13,1729134761.0,StanleyCups,1,1.0,False

Last year, we ran into some financial problems and had to move in with his parents. It was supposed to be temporary, and at first, I was honestly grateful. But now it's been almost a year and I feel like I’m suffocating.

His parents are incredibly stressful to live with. They constantly criticize me – how I dress, how I take care of our son (8M, autistic), how I cook, pretty much everything. It’s like no matter what I do, it’s never good enough for them. On top of that, they treat me like I'm some kind of live-in servant. I can’t sit down for five minutes without them asking me to get them something. They don’t even ask, really – they just expect it. They want coffee? Guess who’s getting it. They need something from the store? I’m the one running the errand. I’m tired and feel like I'm walking on eggshells constantly.

I’ve tried talking to my husband about it, but he always brushes it off, saying they’re ""old school"" and we should be grateful they let us stay here when we needed it. I understand that. I’m thankful for their help, but we’re doing fine now. Financially, we could afford to get our own place. When I mention moving out, though, he just says we should wait a little longer. But for how long? I feel like I’m reaching my breaking point.

The other day, his mom basically told me I don’t do enough around the house (which is laughable, because I do more than her), and his dad made some rude comment about how I ""lucked out"" by marrying their son. I was so angry, but I kept quiet in the moment. Later that night, I told my husband that I can’t take it anymore. I said if we don't move out by the end of the month, I'm done. I’m packing up and leaving, with or without him.

He was shocked and said I was being dramatic. He accused me of not appreciating how much his parents have helped us. Now he's upset and thinks I'm being unreasonable for giving him an ultimatum. I love him and I don't want to end our marriage, but I just can't live like this anymore. It's draining me.

I wish I could tell you the exact moment everything went wrong, but the truth is, the apocalypse didn't arrive with a bang – it crept in like a fever.

I was working the night shift at St. Mary's Hospital when Patient Zero came through our doors. Just another Tuesday night in the ER, or so I thought. The guy was burning up, 105.8°F, muttering about a bite he got while hiking in the Appalachians. My colleague Sarah took one look at the festering wound on his shoulder and ordered broad-spectrum antibiotics.

That should have been the end of it.

But three hours later, the man's heart stopped. Nothing unusual there – we lose patients sometimes. Sarah called time of death at 3:47 AM, and we moved him to the morgue. I remember thinking how strange it was that his body was still so warm.

I went to grab coffee from the break room. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting that sickly pale glow that makes everyone look half-dead anyway. My phone buzzed – a text from my sister Claire: *""Turn on the news. Something weird is happening in Atlanta.""*

Before I could check, the Code Blue alarm blared through the speakers. Location: the morgue.

Here's the thing about working in a hospital – you develop a sixth sense for when something isn't right. The hair on the back of my neck stood up as I sprinted down to the basement level. The morgue doors were already open, and I could hear Sarah screaming.

The sight that greeted me will haunt me until the day I die. Our ""dead"" patient had the morgue attendant pinned against the wall, teeth buried deep in the poor guy's neck. But it wasn't the blood that made me freeze – it was the patient's eyes. They were completely white, like pearls rolled back in his skull.

Sarah was trying to pull him off, but he was impossibly strong. I grabbed a fire extinguisher from the wall and swung it as hard as I could at his head. He dropped like a stone, but the damage was already done. The morgue attendant – Bill, I think his name was – slid to the floor, blood pumping from his neck.

""We need to call security,"" Sarah panted, pressing her hands against Bill's wound. ""And the police. And the CDC. This isn't... this isn't normal.""

I nodded, already pulling out my phone. That's when Bill started convulsing.

The next few minutes are a blur in my memory. I remember Sarah trying to help Bill while I dragged her away. I remember the inhuman sounds he started making as his temperature skyrocketed. I remember slamming the morgue doors shut just as both of our ""dead"" patients got to their feet.

We managed to lock them in, but we could hear them throwing themselves against the door, over and over, like rabid animals. Sarah was hyperventilating beside me, her scrubs covered in blood.

""Jake,"" she whispered, using my name for the first time that night, ""what the hell is happening?""

I didn't answer. My phone was lighting up with notifications – similar incidents were being reported all over the city. All over the country. The dead weren't staying dead, and they were hungry.

That was six hours ago. Now I'm barricaded in the hospital pharmacy with Sarah and three other survivors. The power's been cutting in and out, and the screams from the upper floors have mostly stopped. That's not a good thing.

My phone's at 20% battery, but I needed to write this down, to warn anyone who might be reading. If someone you love gets bitten, don't wait. Don't hope. Don't try to help them. Just run.

Because when they turn – and they will turn – they won't be your loved ones anymore.

I have to go now. Sarah says she's not feeling well. Says she's burning up. Says the scratch she got from Bill in the morgue is starting to itch.

God help us all.

It's been 18 hours since my last update. Sarah is dead. I had to... I had to make sure she didn't come back.

I keep replaying it in my mind. The way her fever spiked so fast. How her eyes grew glassy and distant. The moment she looked at me – really looked at me – and whispered, ""Do it."" She knew what was coming. She'd seen it happen to Bill.

I won't describe what came next. I owe her that much dignity.

The three others who were with us – Dr. Chen, a nurse named Marcus, and a terrified patient named Rebecca – they helped me afterward. We wrapped Sarah's body in sheets and locked it in a supply closet. No one mentioned how we could hear scratching from the morgue two floors below, where it all started. No one needed to.

The hospital's generator kicked in around dawn, giving us access to the security cameras. What we saw... Christ. The infection spread through the hospital like wildfire. Most of the staff and patients who couldn't escape in time are now wandering the halls. They move in this horrible, jerky way, like marionettes with half their strings cut.

But here's the really fucked up part – they're learning.

At first, they just shambled around, attacking anything that moved. Now they're showing signs of... coordination. Two hours ago, we watched a group of them work together to corner a survivor on the pediatric floor. They herded him, like wolves. These things aren't just mindless animals. They're evolving.

Dr. Chen thinks it has something to do with the hive mind theory – that they're somehow connected, sharing information. He's been taking notes, trying to document everything. Says if we survive, the information might be valuable.

I think he's losing it.

The good news (if you can call it that) is that we're relatively safe in the pharmacy. The security shutters are reinforced, and we have access to medical supplies. The bad news is that we're running out of food, and the water pressure is getting weak.

Marcus suggested we try to reach the cafeteria on the first floor. It's a suicide mission – we've seen at least thirty infected between here and there on the cameras. But we might not have a choice soon.

Rebecca hasn't spoken since she watched her husband turn in the ER waiting room. She just sits in the corner, methodically organizing pills into rainbow-colored lines. Sometimes she hums lullabies.

An hour ago, we lost the camera feed to the upper floors. The generator must be running low on fuel. Before the screens went dark, we saw something that chills me to my core. The infected were gathering in the main lobby, dozens of them. But they weren't wandering aimlessly anymore. They were... waiting. Watching the main entrance.

That's when we realized – they're not trying to get out.

They're waiting for people to come in.

The National Guard, emergency services, worried family members... anyone coming to help will be walking into a trap. I tried calling 911 again, but the lines are still jammed. Cell service is spotty at best. The internet comes and goes.

From what little information we can piece together from news alerts, it's not just our hospital. The infection has spread to every major city on the East Coast. The last update I saw mentioned military quarantine zones being established, but that was hours ago.

Wait.

Something's wrong. The emergency lights just switched off.

I can hear movement in the ventilation system above us.

Dr. Chen is shining his phone light up at the ceiling tiles. They're vibrating.

Oh god.

They've been in the vents this whole time.

Marcus is screaming at everyone to grab what we can carry. Rebecca has finally snapped out of her daze and is shoving bottles of antibiotics into her pockets.

The ceiling tile just cracked.

I have to go. If you're reading this, stay away from hospitals. Stay away from cities. And whatever you do, don't trust what you think you know about the infected. They're not braindead. They're not mindless.

They're

\[The rest of this update appears to have been cut off\]

I don't know who will find this. My phone is almost dead, and I'm hiding in a maintenance tunnel beneath the hospital. I can hear them moving above me. Searching.

I need to finish telling this story. People need to know the truth.

When the ceiling collapsed in the pharmacy, it wasn't just one or two infected that dropped down. It was like a flood. Dr. Chen was the first to go. He just... froze. Started mumbling equations and infection rates until they grabbed him. Rebecca managed to squeeze through the partially open security gate. Marcus and I followed, but he tripped. I still hear his screams when I close my eyes.

I ran. God help me, I ran.

But here's the thing – running through those halls, watching the infected chase me, I finally understood what makes them different from the zombies in movies and games. They're not rotting. They're not falling apart. They're... improving.

The first ones we saw, like Patient Zero, were clumsy and aggressive. But the newer ones? They're faster. Stronger. The virus isn't killing the host – it's optimizing it. Rewiring it. Creating something better.

I found that out the hard way when I ran into what used to be Sarah.

She was standing at the end of a corridor, perfectly still. When she saw me, she smiled. Actually smiled. Then she spoke.

""Jake,"" she said, her voice a horrific parody of her old self, ""we've been waiting for you. Don't you want to evolve?""

I ran the other way, but they were herding me. Every route I took led me deeper into the hospital. Eventually, I found the entrance to these maintenance tunnels behind a broken vending machine. They haven't found me yet, but they're getting closer.

My phone's been picking up emergency broadcasts. The military is planning to ""sanitize"" the infected zones at dawn. That's government speak for ""burn it all down."" They know what I know now – this isn't a disease that can be cured. It's an evolution that can't be stopped.

The infected aren't trying to eat us. They're trying to change us. Each generation of the virus is more sophisticated than the last. Those coordinated attacks we saw? That was just the beginning. They're building a network. A hive mind. And it's growing smarter by the hour.

I can hear helicopters in the distance. The evacuation must be starting. Or maybe it's something worse.

But I need to tell you the most terrifying part. Something I saw on my way down here. Something that explains why this is spreading so fast, why quarantine won't work.

The infected... they can play dead. I saw a group of them lying motionless as a rescue team entered the building. Perfect stillness until the moment was right. Then they just... got up.

Think about it. How many bodies are in morgues right now? In funeral homes? How many people were declared dead in the early hours of this thing, only to ""turn"" later? They're not turning at all. They're waiting.

We're not at the start of this apocalypse. We're somewhere in the middle.

My phone's at 2%. The tunnels branch off ahead of me. I can hear water running somewhere – maybe a way out through the storm drains. But I can also hear something moving down here with me. Something that's breathing too regularly to be human anymore.

If you're reading this, remember:

* They can play dead
* They're getting smarter
* They work together
* They can speak
* And most importantly: if you think you're safe, you're already

\[Connection Lost\]

\[ADDITIONAL UPDATE - Posted from unknown location, 12 hours later\]

We are evolving. We are improving. We are waiting.

Don't be afraid.

Been on a daily probiotic for years. Also, gastro doctor put me on 10 mg of Amitriptyline a day to help manage my IBS stomach pain which worked wonders for years. Had a colonoscopy about 6 years ago when my IBS first started and it was clean…

With that being said, last Saturday around 6 PM I ate some pork ramen (a to go order) from a local place. That night around 3 AM I woke up with my heart racing, extremely gassy, nausea, and diarrhea. Needless to say I didn’t sleep the rest of the night from using the bathroom so often.

The next morning I drank a bottle of pedialyte and finally got some sleep pretty much all day on Sunday. I woke up Sunday night feeling somewhat better. I ate a few pieces of toast and went back to sleep the rest of the night.

Monday I woke up, went to office and felt pretty much ok. I drank a single cup of coffee and really didn’t touch any food until I got home. I ate some grilled chicken plain that night with some toast. I was no longer having diarrhea at this point.

Tuesday I felt even better, it was my mother’s birthday so I ended up not eating again until the evening. I ate a pork chop, some mashed potatoes, and some carrots. I also had one cupcake. I strangely got constipated and realized I hadn’t had a bowel movement since Sunday night.

Still was feeling fine all the way up until today. This morning, I had an apple fritter around lunch time and then for dinner I had a sandwich and half of a baked potato. A few hours later, I started to feel gassy, have some lower back pain going on, and now I’m again having diarrhea. I’m very irritated.

I’ve also had some fatigue, some mild headaches, and slight dizziness from time to time throughout.

I plan to drink another bottle of pedialyte tonight to ensure I don’t get dehydrated.

With all this being said, does this seem normal in the process of recovery from what I assume was food poisoning?

The ingredients are listed as:

- Irish whiskey

- Sercial Madeira

- Coffee

- Cherry Brandy

- Cherry Pit Cream

Her birthday is coming up and I'd love to make at least an approximation of this at home. I'd imagine the cream is clarified somehow and the coffee is a syrup or bitters. Help me with your dark arts!",0,1729132039.0,cocktails,4,0.4,False

They didn't respond at the time in any way, being speechless, and I did not press the topic further.

Instead of distancing themselves however, like I feared, the frequency of our discussions and meet ups increased (some ups and downs due to work load)

The last two days however, texting went way up. They were pretty sick until yesterday, so I was just checking in and that turned into 4 hour texting sessions two days in a row. Throughout those talks they initiated topics as soon as one discussion came to a close. Our conversations were never one sided, however them promoting a new topic out of the blue like that is new.

We didn't talk about ""relationship-stuff"", but the topics are quite heavy, emotionaly intimate and taxing at times. Though the vibe did remain quite uplifting throughout all due to us making jokes along they way and being supportive.

At the end they reminded me of and formally invited me to a party which we talked about earlier. Due to me attending an event with a shared friend group I'm not able to attend though. I did however offer my help in prepping for the party (mostly cooking) before leaving for said event.

They accepted with thanks, did however state that we could also just go for some coffee at their place instead.

My question now is, is this something to read into? 

Normally I wouldn't due to us being friends, but I told them about my feelings and every time we meet up, I think, it's pretty obvious that I'm still very much interested in them.

They were in a long term relationship until last year. I don't know if that's entirely relevant, though I believe that would change your priorities in terms of pursuing another relationship/checking for red flags and such. (i.e. good friend may not equal good partner)

TL;DR, My friend that knows I have feelings for them suddenly inceases the length and frequency of our conversations and kinda asked me to meet them 1on1 before a party for coffee. Is that still normal friend behaviour in this situation?",1,1729131814.0,dating,3,1.0,False

My Jr Admin pings me this morning, while I'm still in bed and the coffee pot hasn't even started brewing, ""I thought the quarterly release wasn't supposed to be live until tomorrow. Is this right?"" Sends a screenshot of a specific feature from the release (that I'd planned to disable the second it was live) clearly visible to our entire user base. 

Thankfully, he knew to ping me before working hours on something like that, and we were able to quickly disable it mostly before anyone noticed. Of course a few did, but their complaints got them volun-told onto the beta-test team for next week. (My status: Still in pajamas).

My day was supposed to be final testing and sending training comms out. Instead, it was crash implementation/config since the rest of the features couldn't be rolled back. Figure out who is most likely to flip out first, get them the launch deck quickest, lather, rinse, repeat. Vendor gaslights me and claims they 'always launch a day early....'. 

Until about noon, when one of my power users asks a totally unrelated question about system access for one of his clients. Access which has -100% to do with this launch since client users can't see any of these features.

...except, they can, which I found in testing his unrelated question. Not only can they see them, even though I disabled them globally, they can take edit actions that their read-only permission sets don't allow. Queue my second support call for the day.

So now the hundreds of genuinely frustrated users with unexpected new UI layouts take a backseat to a security risk analysis. Thankfully, the edit feature is also broken, so it TELLS them the change was made but doesn't actually make it. (My status: STILL pajamas, but now coffee). Back-channel peers at other companies about the issue so they can dogpile tlon my support ticket.

Several unrelated support tickets roll in, asking if I can quickly make my platform intercept Death Star missles and use them to mirror the Disney fireworks show ...by tomorrow. (Um. No. Also, WTF?)

Internal support channel blips: ""Is <system> down for anyone else?"" Me: *clickyclicky* F************ck ""Yes, system is down completely."" Third support call to vendor. Teach Jr Admin phrase, 'Some days, you're the windshield. Some days, you're the bug.'

Continue drafting training emails while vendor scrambles. System comes back up. My vain hopes of a release rollback die miserably, and the security hole still exists. (4pm, still pajamas, now into Monster/Celcius highballs)

All of this is an unusually bad day, but...we don't cure cancer. We aren't first responders, nobody is bleeding, everybody is breathing. I am frustrated and grumpy that my nice phased rollout got blown to hell, but c'est la vie.

Until my husband gets home, and mentions that this morning he had to throw away the brand new box of very nice gourmet cookies that were on the counter because apparently we have ants. We hadn't even tried two of them! I have found the insects that broke the sys-admins back. Finally manage to explain that I'm not actually crying over the cookies, before he drives an hour each way to go get more.

Status: 10pm, no pajamas, 3rd glass of port. No cookies. 😞

Realizing all of the episodes of Stargate sg1, Atlantis, and universe, extrapolate a pilot for the first episode of a sci fi parody series that is comedic in nature.

## **Stargate: Galaxy Farts**

**Pilot Episode: ""Wormhole Wednesday""**

**Scene 1: The SGC**

*Colonel Jack O'Neill, now a grizzled and slightly senile veteran, is sitting at his desk, sipping a cup of coffee.*

**O'Neill:** ""Alright, Carter, let's see what's on the docket for today. Ah, yes. Wormhole Wednesday. Just what I needed to spice up my life.""

*Dr. Samantha Carter, now a middle-aged woman with a penchant for bad puns, enters the room.*

**Carter:** ""Colonel, have you heard the latest? The Goa'uld are planning to launch a massive attack on Earth using a new weapon: the Death Ray 2.0. It's basically a really powerful laser pointer.""

**O'Neill:** (Chuckling) ""A laser pointer? That's it? We're supposed to be scared of a laser pointer?""

*General Hammond, now a doddering old man, enters the room.*

**Hammond:** ""Gentlemen, gentlemen. We must take this threat seriously. I've assembled a team of our finest. Let's meet them in the briefing room.""

**Scene 2: The Briefing Room**

*The team is assembled, including Teyla Emmagan, now a fitness guru, John Sheppard, now a washed-up actor, and Daniel Jackson, now a conspiracy theorist.*

**Hammond:** ""This is our mission. We must travel through the Stargate to the planet P3X-887 and stop the Goa'uld from activating the Death Ray 2.0.""

**Carter:** ""But, General, that planet is known for its extreme flatulence. The air is so foul, it could knock a Goa'uld out cold.""

**O'Neill:** (Excitedly) ""Flatulence? That's even better! Let's do it!""

**Scene 3: Planet P3X-887**

*The team arrives on the planet, which is covered in giant, farting cows.*

**Sheppard:** ""This place smells... awful.""

**Teyla:** (Noses the air) ""I sense... a disturbance in the Force.""

*Suddenly, a giant Goa'uld appears, holding the Death Ray 2.0.*

**Goa'uld:** ""You cannot stop me! I will destroy Earth with my powerful laser pointer!""

*O'Neill, Carter, and Hammond look at each other, then at the Goa'uld.*

**O'Neill:** ""Well, we can't just stand here and let him do that. Let's show him what we're made of.""

*The team charges at the Goa'uld, but instead of fighting, they start farting at him. The Goa'uld is overwhelmed by the stench and collapses.*

**O'Neill:** ""Well, that was... unexpected.""

*The team returns to Earth, victorious. As they celebrate, Hammond turns to O'Neill.*

**Hammond:** ""Colonel, I think we've found our new mission. From now on, we're going to be known as the Stargate Flatulence Force.""

**O'Neill:** (Grinning) ""I like the sound of that.""



Draft 2:



## **Stargate: Galaxy Farce**

**Pilot Episode: ""Wormhole Wednesday""**

**Scene 1: The SGC**

*The SGC is bustling as usual, but with a decidedly more comedic atmosphere. Colonel Jack O'Neill is sitting at his desk, sipping coffee and reading the newspaper.*

**O'Neill:** (muttering to himself) ""Another day, another alien invasion. I swear, these Goa'uld are getting lazier by the year.""

*Samantha Carter walks in, looking flustered.*

**Carter:** Jack, we've got a new dialing-in. It's a planet called ""Planet Hollywood.""

**O'Neill:** (rolls his eyes) ""Great. Now we're dealing with the Kardashians of the galaxy.""

*Teal'c and Daniel Jackson enter, looking equally unimpressed.*

**Teal'c:** ""This is a waste of my time.""

**Daniel:** ""Perhaps we could use this opportunity to study the culture of Hollywood. It might be enlightening.""

**Scene 2: Planet Hollywood**

*The team arrives on Planet Hollywood, a gaudy, over-the-top planet filled with neon lights and giant statues of celebrities. A holographic Elvis Presley greets them.*

**Elvis:** (singing) ""Welcome to my beautiful, beautiful world!""

*The team is immediately overwhelmed by the sensory overload. Carter starts taking pictures, Teal'c is trying to figure out if there are any Jaffa here, and Daniel is trying to decipher the local language, which is mostly movie quotes.*

**O'Neill:** (to himself) ""This is worse than the Tok'ra.""

*Suddenly, a giant, inflatable replica of the Statue of Liberty appears, and a voice booms over a loudspeaker.*

**Voice:** ""Attention, Earthlings! You are now under the control of the Galactic Glitterati!""

*A group of aliens dressed in sequined jumpsuits and wearing sunglasses appear. They are led by a flamboyant alien named ""Glitterman.""*

**Glitterman:** ""We demand you surrender your planet's supply of popcorn and celebrity gossip!""

**O'Neill:** (sighs) ""Of course.""

*The team reluctantly agrees to give up the planet's supply of popcorn. As they leave, Glitterman waves goodbye.*

**Glitterman:** ""And remember, Earthlings, always strive to be more fabulous!""

*The team returns to the SGC, looking exhausted but relieved. As they walk away, O'Neill turns back and looks at the planet.*

**O'Neill:** ""Well, at least it wasn't the Ori.""



Draft 3:



## **Stargate: Galaxy Quest**

**Episode Title:** ""The Quest for the Ultimate MacGuffin""

**Scene 1: The Command Room**
* **General Jack O'Neill:** (in a deadpan voice) ""Well, this is a new one. We've got a message from a planet called 'Krypton'.""
* **Dr. Daniel Jackson:** (excitedly) ""Krypton? That's impossible! It's a myth!""
* **Samantha Carter:** (rolls her eyes) ""Or maybe it's just another planet with a weird name.""
* **Colonel Teal'c:** (in his usual monotone) ""I do not understand.""

**Scene 2: The Message**
* A holographic projection of a Superman-like figure appears.
* **The Kryptonian:** ""Greetings, Earthlings. We are in dire need of your assistance. A powerful artifact, the 'MacGuffin', has been stolen by the evil Lord Business.""

**Scene 3: The Team Prepares**
* **O'Neill:** ""So, we're basically in a movie now?""
* **Carter:** ""Looks like it. And I'm pretty sure the MacGuffin is a plot device.""
* **Jackson:** (dreamily) ""But it's so exciting! Adventure, aliens, and... a MacGuffin!""
* **Teal'c:** (confused) ""What is a 'MacGuffin'?""

**Scene 4: The Planet of Business**
* The team arrives on a planet that looks like a giant office building.
* **O'Neill:** ""This place is... corporate.""
* **Business Executives:** (in unison) ""Welcome to Business Planet! We can help you with all your business needs.""
* **Carter:** ""I think we're supposed to be fighting a villain, not buying office supplies.""

**Scene 5: The Showdown**
* Lord Business, a stereotypical villain with a bad suit, confronts the team.
* **Business:** ""The MacGuffin is mine! It will make me the most powerful being in the universe!""
* **O'Neill:** (sarcastically) ""Wow, that's a real power grab. A *business* power grab.""
* **A climactic battle ensues, filled with ridiculous special effects and over-the-top dialogue.**

**Scene 6: The Resolution**
* The team defeats Lord Business and retrieves the MacGuffin.
* **O'Neill:** ""Well, that was... something.""
* **Carter:** ""I think we need a vacation.""
* **Jackson:** ""But what about the MacGuffin? What do we do with it?""
* **Teal'c:** ""Perhaps we should sell it on eBay.""

*The episode ends with a montage of the team's misadventures, including a dance-off with aliens and a cameo from the cast of *Galaxy Quest*. The final shot is of the team standing in front of the Stargate, looking exhausted but satisfied.*

1g5gg9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1g5gg9i/speaker_suggestions_placement_recommendations_for/,Speaker suggestions & placement recommendations for loft & concrete floors?,"Looking to upgrade the speaker setup at our house, looking for a bit of advice on which speakers folks would recommend. Currently we have 2 old school original Sonos 1's. We don't listen to our music or TV super loud, but do like it to sound great at lower volumes. Dolby Atmos not too important for us for music, but curious about it for movies.  I have found our house to be a bit tricky with its acoustics due its vault and hard surfaces. There are two spaces we are considering:

Kitchen/dining/living space:

This space is 28x24 and has large vaulted ceilings and hard surfaces like the windows. I've tried having the speakers lower down but found the sound got jumbled from the vault. Currently the Sonos 1's are located up in the loft over the kitchen pointing towards the windows and the sounds seems ok.

* Wondering what would be best for this space?
* Any recommendations on placement for a vault like this besides from the loft?
* A pair of 5s? Stick with the 1's? Something else?
* Would a sub help?

Rec room:

The space is L shaped, with the TV area being 12x24. Pretty standard, 65 inch tv with couch about 8-9 feet from the TV. Would love surrounds, only worry is I don't have too much space behind the couch due to the walk way. There is a rug under the couch/coffee table, but the rest of the room has concrete floors. We have to be a bit mindful of sound with the kids rooms down the hallway (there is a door to the hallway, and not sharing any walls). Was thinking Arc Ultra, Sub 4, Era 300's surrounds, but maybe overkill?

https://preview.redd.it/5vtwped208vd1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10d70371fb7356ed92114b51af3436236f35eac5

* Can the surrounds be right up next to the back of the couch or should the be a bit further back?
* Would era 300's be over kill for the space or work well?
* Any other advice for this space?
