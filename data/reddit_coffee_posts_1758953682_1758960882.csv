There's this new girl at my class and I made the mistake of talking with her, why mistake? Because now she follows me everywhere, and it'd be fine, except we've got absolutely nothing to talk about.

She likes going out, I like staying in, I enjoy videogames, she finds them boring, she enjoys love sereis, I find them cliche. So our time together is really awkward.

And we can leave the school in the break time, so about 30 minutes, and what I want is to go to a coffee shop there's nearby and sit alone, read or study or anything like that, but I can't because she's always with me, and I know she'd have a lot more fun if she just went with some other people, but the problem is that she's shy so she just won't and I don't want to leave her alone.",1,1758959975.0,u_Academic-One1411,0,1.0,False

1nrphtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nrphtz/3_key_things_i_did_to_significantly_reduce_my/,3 key things I did to significantly reduce my anxiety this year.,"
For 15 years I‚Äôve been at war with my anxiety. I‚Äôve read every book, spoken to multiple psychologists, tried every habit and taken every supplement. 99% of the solutions out there had zero effort on me. 

But I did find 3 things that made a huge difference and have allowed me to live a much calmer life. So for the benefit of this community, here they are: 

1. Less coffee - so obvious, but this took me 10 years to figure out. I‚Äôve always had two coffees a day. I experimented changing that to one a day around 10am, and my anxiety levels dropped significantly. It has been the biggest change I‚Äôve made this year. I love coffee too much to cut to zero, but sometimes I just have a decaf on crazy days. 

2. Naturopath - my wife saw one to help her hormonal acne. Within 5 months she was unrecognisable. So I tried him for anxiety. He did a cortisol test and discovered my levels were completely off (way too low in the morning and way too high in the afternoon). He gave me a supplement routine which has helped rebalance my cortisol and reduced the large spikes that often led to attacks. Can provide my stack if anyone interested, it‚Äôs pretty basic. 

3. Trigger logging - I started logging every time I felt anxious and tried to work out the trigger. Patterns quickly emerged. For example, I found that when playing certain games that were intense, I felt very anxious for hours afterwards. So I then started actively removing or reducing the activities that triggered me and it‚Äôs been a game changer. Anxiety is often random as we know, but this certainly helps. 

I‚Äôm keeping this as short as possible. Reddit will no doubt send some haters at which point I‚Äôll probably just delete the post üôÇ But hopefully these learnings help someone else out there. ",2,1758959897.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I think that is single-handedly the best (probably unintentional) metaphor to repeated trauma. 

You go to the psychologist, you put in the work, you actively try to heal, only for it all to happen again and for you to realize it will keep happening and you never really left your worm tunnel. Probably never will, because it will keep happening no matter what you do. Once someone is in that ""it will keep happening, why crawl towards the light"" mentality, it is just as hard to get them out as it'd be to get them out of The Buried.

I‚Äôve been on help desk for about 3 years now, and I‚Äôm planning to go for a Bachelor‚Äôs at WGU to finally move past it. The main decision I‚Äôm stuck on is whether I should lean into programming or cyber security, since I enjoy both but I‚Äôm not sure if that interest is just hobby-level or if I‚Äôd really thrive in a career built around it.

Red team sounds like the dream path, mostly because I genuinely love the hacking side of things. Doing labs on TryHackMe and HackTheBox feels fun and engaging, like solving puzzles with a purpose. On the flip side, I can also see the appeal of blue team work tracking down threat actors, analyzing their moves, and cutting them off before they can cause damage. Both directions have aspects that interest me.

The thing I‚Äôm worried about is the ‚Äúreal life‚Äù version of the job. Instead of hacking challenges or digital detective work, I imagine a lot of roles are more about making sure people don‚Äôt make obvious mistakes like Ann from accounting falling for another phishing email, or Jim from marketing leaving his passwords on sticky notes, or managers losing sensitive data on flash drives at coffee shops. That side of cyber feels less exciting, but maybe that‚Äôs just the unglamorous reality.

After years in help desk and tech support, I‚Äôve seen firsthand how unaware people can be when it comes to security risks. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm trying to get a clearer picture does cyber security actually lean more into the strategic/hands-on work, or is most of it basically babysitting people so they don‚Äôt make dumb mistakes?

Hello! | started taking vyavance about a year ago, and it's been so helpful! My binge eating is under control and l'm able to focus much better on a single task instead of getting distracted and trying to do too many things at once just to end up doing nothing at all - any way, I started on a low dose - about 17mg, I would do this by dividing my dose, my method adviced by my shrink was to empty my 70mg capsule into a vile of 30ml water, I would shake it up and take a table spoon of the water mixture, this now will last four days taking it in the morning, so essentially I was dividing the 70mg tablet and taking it over 4 days... after about 9months the 17mg dose has not as effective and I find the dividing dose method to be very inconsistent, some days I would feel nothing at all, super brain fog! And other days it felt too much and my anxiety would flair up pretty bad. So now after chatting to my shrink l've decided to move up to 30mg and just take one pill every morning to ensure more consistent results. I can feel it working again but my anxiety gets soooo bad now, after about 2 hours my anxiety really flairs up and it seems to be effecting my breathing, I keep having to take really deep breaths to try regulate myself... it's only day three of the new 30mg dose so l'm hoping after a week it subsides, I also hadn't taken it for about a week while I was waiting for my new script from the doctor so my body may be readjusting. Anyway - long story short, anyone else experiencing anxiety?
How do you deal with it? Any advice please? I'm also wondering if I need to cut of caffeine because I'll take the pill in the morning - feel fine for an hour, then drink a yummy coffee when I get to work weh really helps to wake me up too but then an hour later l'm on the anxiety train...

The hook isn‚Äôt fancy tech; it‚Äôs ruthless clarity and tiny actions (‚Äúnano moves‚Äù) executed quickly so momentum compounds.

# What the program actually is

* **Format:** live 3-day group coaching (now available as full recordings), where Ryan builds a list **from zero** in real time‚Äîopt-in page, giveaway, nano content, simple 1-step funnel.
* **Philosophy:** *Your list is your business.* Traffic is pointless without capture; long, complicated automation is unnecessary.
* **Price (launch window):** ‚ÄúAll-In‚Äù bundle discounted from $997 ‚Üí **$297** (auto-applied).
* **Deliverables:** lifetime access to recordings, 100+ pages of swipe files/resources, every AI prompt used, plus bonuses (below).

# Core outcomes & frameworks

* **The Sprint-to-1K Method** A clarity filter to pick a simple promise + giveaway, then sprint to proof-of-concept (1,000 subs) without ads or giant launches.
* **Nano Traffic Method** 10‚Äì45 second clips (face optional, AI-assisted if you want) batched in 30‚Äì60 minutes that drip constant traffic daily. Think ‚Äúmicro reps‚Äù ‚Üí macro growth.
* **Nano Funnel (Views ‚Üí Subs)** A minimal, 1-step capture flow: attention ‚Üí CTA ‚Üí opt-in. No labyrinthine sequences; just a clean offer and a welcome email that converts.
* **Start-From-Zero Workflow** How to pick a market, promise, and lead magnet quickly even if you have *no audience*. You copy each click Ryan makes as he builds live.
* **‚ÄúBest. List. Ever.‚Äù Welcome** Crafting a single, great **welcome email** that gets opens, clicks, and early sales‚Äîwithout a 39-email autoresponder saga.
* **Low-Tech Build** Over-the-shoulder landing page setup with **minimal tools**; if you‚Äôre ‚Äúnot techie,‚Äù this is the point.
* **Confidence & momentum** Tiny wins, daily dopamine‚Äîwatching subs tick up in real time kills perfectionism and keeps you shipping.

# What you get inside (deliverables)

* **3 live workshop recordings** (full event, step-by-step builds)
* **Done-for-you templates**: opt-in pages, emails, nano scripts
* **‚Äú1K frameworks‚Äù** for clarity & speed
* **AI prompts/workflows** to multiply output without more work
* **Lifetime access** to all materials & swipes (100+ pages)

**Exclusive Bonuses:**

1. **‚Äú$20 Per Email Subscriber/Month‚Äù Coaching** ‚Äì Ryan‚Äôs approach to writing daily(ish) emails that monetize a simple list.
2. **‚ÄúHow to Get 1M Views on YouTube‚Äù** ‚Äì titles, topics, thumbnails, and workflows behind multi-million-view bursts in a new niche.
3. **Copy/Paste Landing Page Templates** ‚Äì the exact pages built live; duplicate and ship.

# Why it‚Äôs different (my take)

* **Execution over theory.** You literally watch him build the system from scratch and mirror each step.
* **Clarity over complexity.** One clean offer + nano traffic + capture ‚Üí results.
* **Face optional.** Works with personal brand *or* faceless.
* **Coffee-shop friendly.** Lean stack, solo-operator speed, no bloated funnels.

# Who it‚Äôs best for / not for

* **Great for:** creators, coaches, freelancers, indie SaaS/ecom owners who need *proof of demand* and a real list quickly.
* **Also good for:** total beginners overwhelmed by conflicting advice; ‚Äúbehind-the-scenes‚Äù operators who prefer faceless content.
* **Not ideal for:** people hunting a one-click hack or unwilling to post nano content for a couple weeks.

# Realistic outcomes

* **Week 1‚Äì2:** working opt-in, first nano clips live, subs trickling daily.
* **Month 1:** 300‚Äì700 subs if you post consistently and keep the promise narrow.
* **Beyond:** 1K+ subs ‚Üí welcome email monetization, affiliate tests, or a simple no-brainer offer.

# Final take

**Sprint To 1K** is a refreshingly *light* list-building system. No sprawling funnels, no ad spend required. If you‚Äôve been paralyzed by 50 different strategies, this gives you one path, in order, you can execute in a weekend‚Äîthen refine as you scale.",1,1758958591.0,MinaIrfanFANCLUB,0,1.0,False

One time, we were meant to go to the movies together to watch the latest Disney flick, but she called 30 minutes before it started and said that she was going to be late ‚Äúbecause Megan had an autistic meltdown that gave Danny an autistic meltdown‚Äù, and suggested we go to the museum instead. Another time, we were all going to go to Disneyland together, and you know how the airports say you need to get there 2 hours before your flight? Yeah, she was basically full hour late. I was suuuuuuper stressed at check-in because I have this metal plate in my leg, and with us only have 90 minutes was sure we were going to miss our flight! Thankfully it didn‚Äôt happen, but it was a close call y‚Äôknow? I only got 25 minutes in the VIP lounge.


Now my partner (57m) and I (DD-cups) don‚Äôt have kids. I wanted them, but my partner said he‚Äôd get jealous or I might get fat. So I love babysitting my nieces and nephews. I like being the fun, popular aunt. My dream is what when she‚Äôs 14, my eldest niece will say I‚Äôm cool and insist I hang out with all her friends. Sometimes my sister will call me and ask if I can pick the kids up from school, because one of her shifts at the business factory doesn‚Äôt finish until 7pm.¬†


So we‚Äôve had this system for a little while now, where I pick up and babysit the kids on that every second Thursday. And sure, she pays me, but I feel like she isn‚Äôt grateful enough y‚Äôknow? Like the number of thank you‚Äôs I‚Äôve gotten over the last two years have gotten rote and she isn‚Äôt *really* super super grateful.


So last Thursday, at 5pm, I told her I wasn‚Äôt going to pick up her kids from daycare, and that she needs to be more organised with her time and stop being late to everything because it was super inconsiderate of our time.


Instead of apologising, my sister just sort of snapped at me about how the daycare closes at 4pm - like I don‚Äôt know that - and that if I wanted to change our contract then I should have just said so. (Which, duuuh, what do you think I‚Äôm doing?). And then she blew up at me, and said ""You don‚Äôt have kids, you don‚Äôt understand how hard this is. You get to be selfish with your time"".


So anyway, I guess she called our mom to do a grandma pick up, which is good, but now our parents and my cat are blowing up my phone and being super mean to me. Our extended family, friends and family friends have mixed opinions. When I first called my sister, I didn‚Äôt think I was being cruel - I was just speaking my truth; that I feel unappreciated and am sick of her, but now I‚Äôm not so sure. I don‚Äôt think its wrong for me to set boundaries, but AITA?

I started taking vyavance about a year ago, and it‚Äôs been so helpful! My binge eating is under control and I‚Äôm able to focus much better on a single task instead of getting distracted and trying to do too many things at once just to end up doing nothing - any way, I started on a low dose - about 17mg, I would do this by dividing my dose, my method adviced by my shrink was to empty my 70mg capsule into a vile of 30ml water, I would shake it up and take a table spoon of the water mixture, this now will last four days taking it in the morning, so essentially I was dividing the 70mg tablet and taking it over 4 days‚Ä¶ after about 9months  the 17mg dose has not as effective and I find the dividing dose method to be very inconsistent, some days I would feel nothing at all, super brain fog! And other days it felt too much and my anxiety would flair up pretty bad. So now after chatting to my shrink I‚Äôve decided to move up to 30mg and just take one pill every morning to ensure more consistent results. I can feel it working again but my anxiety gets soooo bad now, after about 2 hours my anxiety really flairs up and it seems to be effecting my breathing, I keep having to take really deep breaths to try regulate myself... it‚Äôs only day three of the new 30mg dose so I‚Äôm hoping after a week it subsides, I also hadn‚Äôt taken it for about a week while I was waiting for my new script from the doctor so my body may be readjusting. Anyway - long story short, anyone else experiencing anxiety? How do you deal with it? Any advice please? I‚Äôm also wondering if I need to cut of caffeine because I‚Äôll take the pill in the morning - feel fine for an hour, then drink a yummy coffee when I get to work which really helps to wake me up too but then an hour later I‚Äôm on the anxiety train‚Ä¶",1,1758958509.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False
1nrp4qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AbandonedVegetable/comments/1nrp4qk/an_unsent_letter/,An Unsent Letter,"Take this to your therapist and really think about if I‚Äôm narcissistic, if I‚Äôm manipulative. Everyone can be selfish or unintentionally manipulative if you are letting your feelings and trauma get the best of you, and all my traumas got ripped wide open when you started saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù and I need space.

# Here‚Äôs what I take accountability for.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm changing for myself and for you.

I have unrepaired trauma from my parents and my childhood and teenage years. I need to learn to parent and show up for myself now in ways that I wasn‚Äôt able to in my childhood. I was abandoned and neglected, bullied, belittled and humiliated, abused mentally and physically by those around me whom I trusted. Despite all this, I have come to be a very empathic, caring, and giving person because of my work to overcome these things. Through years of therapy, which I still need more of. I have a generous spirit, and I give because I love to love. I love to lighten someone‚Äôs load or make their day better, and if I have the energy to give and don‚Äôt expect something in return, why wouldn‚Äôt I do that? Regardless of this, it doesn‚Äôt excuse poor behaviour.

Lying. I will tell you that I am better now than before I met you, by such a large margin it‚Äôs not even funny. But it‚Äôs not acceptable, and I am working on it. It comes from fear, protection, embarrassment, and shame. It‚Äôs how I survived my childhood and avoided abuse. To keep people happy by telling them what they wanted to hear. To not have to admit to my shortcomings or mistakes. To help me pretend to be someone I wasn‚Äôt. To save myself from rejection and discomfort. It became a habit and a bad one. I have struggled to unlearn this my whole life. And I will continue to struggle with it until I no longer do. The truth is always better than a facade, and it took me a long time to learn that. I learned early that no matter what I said that was truthful, it would be read as not enough, or disappointing, and I would get belittled and physically punished if I told the truth about messing up, even if I tried my best. So I learned to lie to protect myself. It isn‚Äôt okay. And I‚Äôm sorry about the things I lied to you about, big or small. No more exaggerations, just the truth.

I have trouble expressing my needs because it scares the shit out of me. I‚Äôm used to expressing my needs and having them ignored or being told that they‚Äôre not important right now. But my needs and boundaries are important, and they do matter. And in a healthy relationship, you need to communicate those, or you are doing a disservice to both people. Be vulnerable and let people in; it helps build trust by showing them how you are really feeling and what you‚Äôre really thinking.

I have big emotions that come with adhd and need to learn to regulate them better, be uncomfortable, and take a step back and realize that criticism isn‚Äôt conflict, it‚Äôs healing. Being uncomfortable is okay; new experiences will be uncomfortable. If you behave the same way you did in the past, but in new situations. You won‚Äôt change the outcome. A new outcome can only be achieved by a new reaction to an old scenario.

I don‚Äôt have a porn addiction, I have an intimacy and dopamine addiction that comes from having adhd and a poor childhood where I lacked having my needs met and lacked connection and closeness. And in turn, I use porn and adult content as a means of dopamine and connection. Both things that I didn‚Äôt think about and which I didn‚Äôt deal with on my own or come to you to talk about soon enough. That is why, when I felt I was losing closeness and intimacy (hugs, physical contact, sex, kissing) with you, I resorted to dealing with my problem on my own and in secret because that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm used to fulfilling my needs from my past, and it was shameful and selfish and inconsiderate. I chase dopamine, and I do it in unhealthy ways. I am changing that and breaking the cycle of addiction and self-medicating with unhealthy habits, forming new ones, and removing sources of temptation to control and remove those urges. I‚Äôm quitting.

The pain that I cause you by doing this and breaking your trust and making you feel like I didn‚Äôt want you or didn‚Äôt find you attractive is immense. And I am so deeply sorry. You didn‚Äôt deserve that. You didn‚Äôt deserve to feel any of that because it wasn‚Äôt about you at all. But you did. It wasn‚Äôt selfish and mean. And I should have done a better job cutting that shit out of my life sooner. And I should have done a better job listening to you and making you feel heard. I asked all the questions in therapy with you on what I can do to fix this and build trust back, and sat in that shame and owned my shit and did my best to do the work to change that behaviour. I know I didn‚Äôt change it fast enough, but I really was trying.

That is my one regret in this relationship: I fucked up, and I‚Äôm still sorry that I made you feel worth less than you deserve.

I broke your trust multiple times because of an issue I have that has nothing to do with you, and I neglected to find a solution fast enough because I was too preoccupied with serving you instead of helping myself. I tried my best, and I didn‚Äôt want to hurt you again, and I am sitting with that guilt. I am not a bad person, but I made mistakes. I know that and I own that. It makes me sick to my stomach that I made you feel like that.

That was not your fault. That was my choice and my issue and my fault. I will always know that, and I‚Äôm so sorry. You didn‚Äôt deserve that. Sure, there are worse things I could have done, but I did something that hurt you and you considered cheating, and it was wrong. I had a problem and I couldn‚Äôt solve it quickly enough. If that‚Äôs why you ended things after you found that picture, then I understand. But I didn‚Äôt know it was there; I thought we had deleted all of that the last time we went through my computer. I swear to god I haven‚Äôt done anything to hurt you since I promised you the last time. No messages, no transactions, nothing. I tried my best to change.

I lost sight of my issues completely. I put you first instead of doing what I should have done, which was my self-work. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt someone I loved so deeply like that, and it wasn‚Äôt your fault. It was mine.

I lied out of shame for my own feelings; I lied because I was too scared to ask for help. I was scared to face the truth, and I was dishonest with myself. I lied because I thought I was protecting you, and that was wrong. A partnership shares their feelings and is vulnerable with each other.

I appreciate the grace and chances you gave me to change my behaviour, and I truly meant I would change it and stop. I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt do that fast enough. That‚Äôs on me.

When I say I‚Äôll stop, I mean it.

I have a bad connection with self-confidence, self-worth, and boundaries to protect my well-being. I need to learn to love myself and not try to earn love from others because if I continue that, I will never be enough. If I don‚Äôt, then I will continue to disrespect myself and put my issues onto others and not heal my wounds.

I put too much into you and forgot to take care of myself. That was my choice.

I abandoned my own self-worth to support you. I took on a parental role because when I first met you and saw how wonderful you were, but how much trauma you had, it reminded me of myself, and I wanted to care for you and make you believe in yourself. Because if someone had done that for me in high school, I wouldn‚Äôt have attempted suicide twice. Now, I didn‚Äôt think you were in the same state, but I saw someone with a heart of gold in a shitty situation, and I wanted to show you that there are good, kind, and compassionate people in this world. And that you deserved to have those same beliefs in yourself. Now, caring for someone and taking care of someone are two different things. And that‚Äôs where the codependency formed for us. I cannot fix your problems, I can‚Äôt control your choices, I can only support and influence you to grow. And I pushed too hard and gave too much to make that happen, and that is a problem. I abandoned myself and put you in a position where you felt like you were constantly letting me down. You were always good enough. You weren‚Äôt a burden; your love was worth the work.

I didn‚Äôt respect your boundaries well enough when you tried to put them up because I wasn‚Äôt getting enough reassurance that you were committed to me. I needed to trust and respect your autonomy more and your intuition more than I needed to self-soothe.

I need to self-regulate my emotions better. ADHD makes it hard to do so, but I‚Äôm going back through my old workbooks to make it a constant habit to correct and adjust to.

I have an abundance of empathy and patience, but I lack the skill to give those to myself. So I always strive for perfection, and that‚Äôs why I feel I have to be in control.

I need to take input better, I need to let myself be uncomfortable not being in control, and trust that it will be fine.

I need to communicate my needs better and to speak up about things that make me uncomfortable, in a way that can still reassure my partner that I love them and they matter to me.

I need to validate your feelings better, but not your behaviour. I enabled you to keep behaving the way you did instead of trying to be realistic/devil's advocate and give you an honest opinion. I waited too long to start doing that. And that came from my lack of self-love and worth.

I lacked the ability to be a safe space when I lost my patience with you. I didn‚Äôt make you feel heard because I got defensive. I need to change that because how can you receive someone‚Äôs hurt or issues with you if you respond by getting upset? I‚Äôm allowed to get upset. I am only human, I will make mistakes, I will fuck up, but I need to communicate that and ask for time or space to process if I need it, so that I can effectively and compassionately receive communication from my partner. But I will not give up, and I will always try to repair what I‚Äôve done wrong. And I always appreciate when I am told what isn‚Äôt working because then I can make a change if I was unaware that I was doing so.

I need to learn how to truly love myself and appreciate who I am, and be able to be as kind, forgiving, and compassionate to myself as I am to others. I deserve to give myself that, and I need to teach myself how to do that so I don‚Äôt rely on others for my happiness.

I was codependent on you; I relied on you for a lot of my happiness and support. I was toxically empathetic. When you hurt, I hurt. And as much as I wanted to sit in the mud with you and not make you feel alone, there are better ways to do it without abandoning my self-love. Because when I abandon myself, I put that pain back onto you.

We shouldn‚Äôt have used my therapist for couples counselling. After hearing what you said about biases, I stopped going to him on my own so that it would be fair and impartial. But we should have gotten a separate couples counselor, and I should have continued going on my own to work on my issues, instead of putting all my effort into helping you with yours. Again, I forgot to prioritize myself.

I need to move out so I can begin building a house with my bricks and remove the bad ones that I was given. Unlearn patterns and remove repeating trauma from my safe space so that I can thrive and create new, healthier boundaries with myself and others.

Relationships open your biggest wounds that are unhealed, and your partner will hurt you more than you think anyone can because you trust them more. But that just shows what you need to work on and to reflect and see those things for what they are, past trauma you haven‚Äôt dealt with yet. And I plan to deal with it.

I tried my best.

I was not perfect, and I can accept that I lacked things in our relationship, and I know what I need to change and fix.

# The truth and honesty. How I really feel about you.

I saw you, I saw through your facade on our 4th date. I saw your hurt, I saw your damage, I saw your issues, and I loved every part. I saw that you were scared to be vulnerable, and it made me love you more. I saw someone who didn‚Äôt believe in themselves but had so much good shining through the cracks. I adored you, all of you. You are my favourite painting. Every brush stroke, whether it‚Äôs a little mistake or a happy accident, I admired every part of you. That‚Äôs why I told you so much about myself the night you asked me to ask you to be my girlfriend. I already thought you were, and I wanted to show you that you could be safe with me, and I let you in, all of my shame and my past. I wanted you to do the same. I trusted you and took a risk. Because nobody knows what will happen, but if you never take a risk, then you‚Äôre doomed to never grow. I want you in my life. Not because I need you, but because I choose you. I want us to have conversations that go deeper, without fear, without walls, without other voices stepping in. I don‚Äôt want to smother you or trap you. I want to be honest with you, so you can see the real me, not the silent version. And if you don‚Äôt want that, I‚Äôll respect it. But if you do, I‚Äôm ready to show up differently than I have before.

I want to be in your life, not out of need, but because I value you. I want us to be open with each other, to share without holding back. I don‚Äôt want to pressure you; I just want to meet you where you feel safe.

I'm proud of you for who you are, for how smart you are. You light up a room when you walk in, you bring an energy like no other. My friends and family adored you, and these past few weeks, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve heard about. I‚Äôm proud of you for growing, even though it‚Äôs exhausting, and not giving up on your health. I‚Äôm proud of you for trying new things that you aren‚Äôt good at and sticking with them. I‚Äôm proud of you for standing up for yourself when it‚Äôs uncomfortable. I‚Äôm proud of you for doing what you think you needed to do.

I‚Äôm just proud to know you. I was humbled by knowing you. You built a kingdom in my heart. You gave me confidence I didn‚Äôt know I needed. You gave me safety. And I‚Äôll miss having my hand on your hip every night, and hugging you and kissing your forehead each morning. You gave me strength and courage, and I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am now without you. But now I am without you.

Try to see the good in the world, improvement is improvement, and don‚Äôt be so negative about things. There are a lot of kind people out there. Some are annoying or have annoying habits, some can be mean, and some are just ignorant of others. Everyone has something good to give; remind yourself of that. It‚Äôs not all bad; there‚Äôs a lot of love in this world, and the little egg on my dashboard reminds me of that.

You will forever be in my heart, and I hope that you are happy when you think of me. I am when I think of you. You can come into my life just like you left, a goddamn hurricane. You changed everything. And I hope you know what you lost, what you gave up. I hope one day you can look back on me and on us and be happy about what we had, because it was special.

I don‚Äôt think many people get a shot at love like what we had.

If you could see even a sliver of yourself from my point of view, you would know how fucking worth it you are. How beautiful you are inside and out. I never could keep my hands off you. And my favourite fucking thing in the world was to listen to you ramble about your day or your friends or an idea or a dream you had. It brought me so much joy just to hear you speak about something that made you happy. You were more than good enough for me. I was good enough. I was good enough for you, and I always tried to show that.

I‚Äôm forever grateful for your patience and your ability to be compassionate and gentle. I‚Äôm grateful for how you helped me grow and see me for who I am, and gave me confidence that I am a good person and I deserve love. That I deserve patience and respect. I‚Äôm thankful for your influence on my life and for how you changed me for the better. I‚Äôm thankful for the habits you got me to start and the affirming words when I stumbled or succeeded. I‚Äôm thankful for you existing on this planet. And I‚Äôm grateful for every moment we have had. I admire your childlike wonderment and the way you make the simplest things feel like gold. It‚Äôs not sunlight, it‚Äôs sunshine. And that‚Äôs what you brought to my life. I'm sorry things ended like they did. I wish we could have been better together. In another life. You deserve love. And to be confident in who you are. You deserve happiness and to stop thinking you aren‚Äôt good enough. You deserve patience, honesty, and compassion.

You deserve sunshine.

Because you are one of the most incredible people I‚Äôve ever had the honour of knowing. And it was an honour to be let into your world and be a part of it. I will always love you, and I will always be thankful for what you have given me.

What you have to offer to this world is why I never gave up on you. You are fucking incredible despite everything that you have been through. You are not broken, you are healing.

I always wanted to work with you. I was never going to give up on having faith in you, on believing in us. We did work, it was beautiful, and I‚Äôll be forever thankful for what we had.

You built a kingdom in my heart and I will be forever grateful for that. 

I will forgive you, will you forgive me? Will you forgive yourself? Whether you choose to let this end or not.

I‚Äôm doing the work.

I‚Äôm here. I never left. I never gave up on you.

# I never quit on you. 

I was always there. Always trying to be better for myself and to try to support you so you wouldn‚Äôt hate yourself so much. all of the driving, the trips, the suprise little gifts, the breakfasts, the lunches, the dinners, the seafood pastas, the mugs you werent allowed to have more of but they made you so happy, the hockey, the soccer, the late night dates where i had to get up in 4 hours for work, the early mornign and late night calls, the driving out to your school every weekend, the flipping my sleep schedule to match yours so we had time on the weekend when you were working, the vulnerable declarations of how much you fucking mean to me, the im proud of you for the little things, the reminders on my phone to make you feel loved, the dancing in the kitchen while making pancakes, the safe spaces i made for you so you could relax and just settle for once, the times when your mom actually let me help with something around the house, the times i dropped everything to come running to comfort you or take you home when you werent safe, the be kind to yourself today, the gentle conversations about how much youve grown, and so much more but im just crying trying to write out all the things i loved every second of doing for you. Because I loved you and you appreciated all of those things. I was always there for you. I always wanted to be there for you

You pushed me out, you stopped trying to be vulnerable. You stopped letting me love you.

# I was insecure and immature.

When we first started, my love was unrestrained. But I saw a girl who hadn‚Äôt been treated right, and I was trying to make up for it. I felt that we had dealt with similar emotions growing up, and I connected with you. And I feel a lot, I love a lot. I have an innate ability to love at a very deep level and to have confidence in people, and I try to believe that people have way more to offer and more good in themselves than they believe. I didn‚Äôt give you grand gestures; I was just trying to make you feel seen and worthy. I wanted to do any little thing I could to make you believe you were worth the time and effort, but no matter what I gave to you, you weren‚Äôt ready to receive that love because you couldn‚Äôt love yourself.

But I didn‚Äôt stop doing that, I didn‚Äôt stop loving you. I never stopped trying to show you I cared. Even when your imperfections or issues arose, I stayed. I kept trying. And I, yes, I made many mistakes, some big and some small. So did you, but we had the patience to let each other prove we were trying to grow.

I betrayed your trust. That will always be on me. I lied, and I made more trauma for you to deal with. But I tried to own that, I know I didn‚Äôt do it right the first time, and you gave me my chances to make it better, to make me better, and I got there. I found my issues that had nothing to do with you, and I owned them and sat with that guilt and shame and tried my best to do something about it to change that behaviour. Maybe I didn‚Äôt spend enough time just listening to you, making you feel heard. And just hearing and feeling your emotions. I went to problem-solving instead, because that‚Äôs what I knew how to do, but I realized that wasn‚Äôt the right way to immediately fix it. And it‚Äôs something that takes time and takes energy from both of us to fix. But I tried to fix it, I did my best because you didn‚Äôt deserve that at all.

And I tried to respect your boundaries as you pushed me away and asked for more and more space. Even though that was the most uncomfortable thing to do because I have anxious attachment. But I tried to do that for you. To make you feel safe.

We are, and we‚Äôre learning how to navigate love and an adult relationship. And I still want to learn with you. I don‚Äôt think many people get a shot at the love that we had before everything got scary and hard, and I don‚Äôt think that was a honeymoon phase when the relationship started to turn to real commitment, real accountability, and support. You got scared. I was too, but when did I leave, when did I not support you, when did I walk away when your flaws and your avoidance came out? I didn‚Äôt, I stayed, and I believed in you. But you couldn‚Äôt say sorry or admit your wrongs, you have issues to work on, and I won‚Äôt let my happiness and my need go unfulfilled.

I always felt at home with you, I always felt like I could be my true self with you, and I was always proud to know you and have you in my life. I didn‚Äôt need to pretend. I loved talking about you to my friends, family, and anyone who would listen. And they loved you too, and they did their best to support you and show you how wanted and valued you were in their home. Why do you think they called you their daughter-in-law?

I always chose you, no matter what the obstacle or what was going on, even though you say that you have too much to deal with, focusing on the obstacles instead of what we‚Äôre both truly saying. That we want this, and we love each other.

Knowing that you lied to me made me feel hurt and I‚Äôve been going over it in my mind and realized I should just talk to you about it, and in truth I can‚Äôt have someone so close to me as you are lying to me, it‚Äôs unacceptable to me and I wanna talk to you about why that happened and I want to understand what led you there so we can make sure it never happens again.

When I stopped only being empathetic and trying to understand your feelings, and just comforted you and made you feel seen. When I started calling you out for your problems and trying to help you grow and change, you turned my empathy against me, making me try harder to understand and hear you. You weaponized it, whether you like it or not. I had standards that I left in the dust because I felt awful for your upbringing and your home life. And I gave you everything you could have asked for to get out, to move forward, and grow, and you got scared and refused to.

# You Hurt Me

You stopped making me feel safe, you stopped making me a priority,  you made me scared and unsure of myself, you avoided hard questions and any questions that would change the status quo, because you wanted love, but you didn‚Äôt want accountability. And when I finally got the courage to tell you what I really needed in a relationship, you responded by saying This is too much, I can‚Äôt do this right now. Or by changing your behaviour and giving me what I needed for a week or two, and then stopping again. You are avoidant, and you lack accountability. I had to fight for every apology whenever I was hurt because of you. I had to fight for apologies, which let me down. You didn‚Äôt let me down as a person, but that behaviour let me down as a partner. And you don‚Äôt want to accept that. Instead, you say I was manipulating you and was narcissistic. I don‚Äôt have to prove to you that I‚Äôm not. I know I‚Äôm not, I was just very in love with you and wanted you to see yourself in a better light, to have confidence and self-esteem, to believe in yourself that you were in control of your life, and you can‚Äôt blame everyone else for your problems.

When you spend 6 and a half years complaining about the same thing, and you never do anything real to change that. That‚Äôs manipulation. Action has a reaction; you fail or you succeed. And if you fail, you try again. That‚Äôs making me feel bad when I‚Äôm trying to find any way to make you feel safe so that you don‚Äôt shut down when I try to talk to you about hard things. When I come to you for support, your issues always take the front seat over mine. And that is on me for not recognizing that and saying something sooner, but I didn‚Äôt want you to feel like a disappointment to me because you were already dealing with so much. I just wanted to love you and for you to love me.

After 4 years, I asked you about moving in for 6 months, and when it finally came time to do it, you said you didn‚Äôt think I was being serious. That hurt a lot, that made me feel alone. And ever since then, I think everything got too real for you. Taking care of yourself, your health, and your mental health was a lot. But you didn‚Äôt have space to truly take care of me, too. That was too much, to be needed by someone and to be accountable when you make a mistake and have to repair it and own that you messed up. You didn‚Äôt do that.

When someone knows they hurt you but chooses silence instead of accountability, that‚Äôs avoidance, not closure. You didn‚Äôt disappear because I was hard to love. You disappeared because guilt is louder than honesty. It‚Äôs easier for you to vanish than to admit you broke something beautiful. But your silence is not my fault. And it‚Äôs not my responsibility to chase closure from someone who won‚Äôt face what they did.

I‚Äôm human. I make mistakes, and so do you, but I try my ass off to fix them, and I have the grace for myself and you that we might not get it fixed the first time or the second, because failure is a part of life. But I will not stop until I have made peace with my demons and held myself accountable for what I‚Äôve done. I will not stop until I‚Äôve grown. Until my mistakes are not torturing me anymore, and until whatever or whoever I‚Äôve done wrong notices I put in the effort. And I‚Äôm doing my best to make a difference.

I just wanted to love you, and for you to love me. I wanted to heal. I wanted you to heal. I always felt safe with you, and I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt feel safe with me.

I knew you were having issues, and learning your love language and attachment style was difficult, but I was trying to be better, and you ignored mine and made me feel like I was manipulating you when I was just begging not to be left and for you to hear me asking for reassurance. But it became too much for you. I think it scared you, and you kept asking for space, which made me more scared.

I just needed you to communicate. But you only would if you felt perfectly safe. Not if there was conflict or you felt any type of discomfort with your feelings. You would just shut down and stone wall me, and I would have to fight to get it out of you; otherwise, you would just let whatever upset you eat you, and it was visible from your behaviour when you were upset. That was so fucking hard for me. I just wanted to hear what you had to say, but you wouldn‚Äôt say it.

I was trying to do everything you asked me to, I was trying to do it all for both of us. You ran, you asked for space, you refused to actually communicate. I‚Äôm not a mind reader. You refused to communicate in therapy with Dan. You didn‚Äôt give me enough communication. You stopped doing the bare minimum for me. What sacrifices did you make? You got a car finally, after I spent 6 years driving you everywhere. ‚ÄúI never asked you to,‚Äù but you accepted it every time. And when you finally got it and finally had that freedom and independence, you spent less time with me. You got more selfish and inconsiderate of my feelings. You expected me to always be there, and I was. You weren‚Äôt. You didn‚Äôt do what you are supposed to do in a relationship: communicate, repair, and keep promises. You ran, you avoided, you deflected. Your feelings are valid, but the way you treat someone because of those feelings is not.

If this was too much for you, too real, too much commitment, too many feelings that you aren‚Äôt ready to face. You could have just said that. You didn‚Äôt have to break my heart. You didn‚Äôt have to try to kill the best part of me, which is my ability to love, my ability to give . I don‚Äôt ever want to do this again, I don‚Äôt ever want to love someone again or be so vulnerable or try so hard, because if it could end like this, then what‚Äôs the point? I grew because of you, I grew with you. I tried my fucking best, and that‚Äôs the whole point. Trying has some kind of action. You fail or you succeed, and if you fail and it matters to you, you try again until you get it right, and the person you‚Äôre with gives you the grace and the support to keep trying. That‚Äôs what I gave to you, every fucking day. Every broken promise, every time you said I‚Äôll do that, I can do that. And you would do it for a week or a month and then fade away. Or you would just tell me you can‚Äôt do something. No, you‚Äôre choosing not to do something because it's hard or scary. Well, I was scared too, but I kept trying. You are the only one with control over your actions, and you refused. I know I put myself in this position by having faith, having confidence, and believing in you. And I still do. But you gave up. You refused to see where you lacked and to do anything about it, to try and repair if you hurt my feelings. You hid away. Said I‚Äôm sorry sometimes, or I would have to fight for an apology, and we would both be upset. And the behaviour didn‚Äôt change. But I still believed they called me dumb or lacking self-respect for putting up with someone who stopped giving me the bare minimum. But I thought you were worth it.

You weren‚Äôt a burden, your love was worth the fucking work.

You threw things back at me that I told you in moments of vulnerability. You cherry-picked specific things I said and took them out of context because you could only hear the bad part of what I said, not the full thing.

I drove fast because you said I was like your dad, who was an age-up human being, and it made me feel like I was 7 years old and my mom was telling me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just like your father,‚Äù who also was an awful human being. I overreacted, I was trying not to yell because I know how much it upsets you. It wasn‚Äôt a better reaction because it didn‚Äôt make you feel safe, but I was trying. I‚Äôve been trying not to get as loud in arguments; that‚Äôs all I knew growing up was screaming and fighting, and I‚Äôm unlearning that. I told you that when I was in high school, I disassociated because I had so many overwhelming feelings and couldn‚Äôt handle them, and in turn, it numbed my empathy and emotions because I didn‚Äôt know how to handle them at 15. I never want to go back there. I‚Äôd rather feel the uncomfortable, awful feelings and realize they aren‚Äôt so scary, and I will live through this even if it is an overwhelming thing. It‚Äôs better to feel everything than nothing at all. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so sensitive now.

That‚Äôs why I hurt so much from this. I can‚Äôt be expected to be perfect, and neither can you, but you can expect me to not stop trying to be better for myself and for the relationship, and I expect the same from you. Give grace and compassion where it is deserved; we don‚Äôt do that enough. We are both hurt and both struggling and learning to navigate our own traumas and experiences. That‚Äôs what life is, growing from what you know and what you are willing to learn. The way you left is more psychologically traumatizing than anything else you could have done. I have never felt pain like this before, and you know exactly what I‚Äôve been through in my life. I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt eat, and all I‚Äôm trying to do is save myself from what is happening because I can‚Äôt process it. I didn‚Äôt know you had it in you to lie to me like that. For however long you planned this, I don‚Äôt even know. How long did you lie to me while you slowly moved your stuff out and still slept in my bed?

But to come over the night before and treat me the exact way I have been asking you for months, a random act of kindness showing up out of the blue and surprising me, hugs and physical affection. That‚Äôs all I ever fucking needed from you. And instead, you gave me your worst fear and mine. You left without a trace, you avoided everything, and abandoned me.

You left me with so much of your stuff. You said you took everything you paid for, but you didn‚Äôt. You just took whatever you could and ran. You left the gifts I have given you over the years. The sweet memories and the fucking Lego that you promised to build with me. I‚Äôve packed everything up; I don‚Äôt have the heart to throw it out or donate it. Please come take it, I won‚Äôt be here.

Was it just to hurt me, though? Was I that bad of a partner? Did I really deserve all this? I was kind, I was patient, and I always showed up no matter the reason.

And all so you could not say goodbye, but so you could pack up your stuff and leave me. Abandon me and everything we ever had. And the worst part is you won‚Äôt communicate now. And you didn‚Äôt even write the goodbye text.

Fine then, blame me. Blame it all on me if that‚Äôs how you want to go about this. If that makes you able to live with yourself. That I was awful and never cared and was manipulative. That I just love bombed you and then pulled away, blame me for all the stress in your life, blame me for all the problems you have, go ahead. Do exactly what your family does and continues to do to you. Hate me, just to hide from what really happened. I need to heal, I need to grow more. I am enough and I am happy enough with myself and my life. But I need to grow so I don‚Äôt let this happen again.

I know you‚Äôre hurting, but all you had to do was actually talk to me. No subtleties, just straightforward words. Be uncomfortable in those feelings and sit and accept them for what they are: scary, big, hurtful, overwhelming. It‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs the patience of a relationship. I'll be patient, and you try. You be patient and I'll try. We give each other grace and trust that our failures aren‚Äôt a reflection of who we are, but instead just the trauma that we carry. And have the compassion to let each other learn to overcome those things.

I just want to talk to you again. I want to communicate and make this beautiful thing we once had work. Because it was beautiful. Getting rid of 5000 pictures of you. My whole camera roll was of you. We had so many good memories. We had so much fun, all of the photos I took of you that you hate, and I adore everyone, and remember each second with you. I miss the girl who waited at her door in a robe for me to show up, and when I left on Sunday night. The one who brought me a jar full of kisses so I wouldn‚Äôt miss you as much, the one who took care of everything in my house when my grandparents passed away. The one who let me nap on her chest when I was anxious or having a bad day. The one who wasn‚Äôt so negative all the time about the world and just enjoyed my company and doing mundane things with me. The slow, cozy Saturday mornings with coffee on the couch. Banana pancakes at the counter. Trips to cabins and seafood pasta dinners. Baking cookies when it was too dark and cold in the winter, and we needed something to cheer us up. Christmas coffee and driving in the snow. Our camping trips. The way you bob your head and do a little dance when you‚Äôre happy with food. All the cute dances you did when you were just being goofy and yourself. I miss driving around and listening to you talk or say ‚Äúcows‚Äù or ‚Äúhorses‚Äù or pointing out something that made you happy or that you laughed at. My god, I love your laugh. I miss you. God, I miss you so much.

But I‚Äôm choosing myself. I don‚Äôt hate you. I get why you did it the way you did it. I just wish you had told me how you were feeling. You stopped getting vulnerable; you pushed me out. I never wanted this. I just wanted what we had; it was more than good enough for me.

There was a lot of good in our relationship. A lot of hard conversations about our past, and trying to overcome these issues. A lot of understanding and compromise, lots of laughs and kindness, and gentle moments. 

We had our problems, but most of our time was golden. 

I‚Äôm doing my best to move on because you‚Äôre not giving me a reason not to, not that I want to, I know I‚Äôm not ready yet, but I have to care for myself. and protect what I have. 

I can‚Äôt wait for you to be ready anymore, and I‚Äôm sorry for that. 

So tell me if one day you feel ready, if one day you regret leaving and losing the future you were going to have. Because you know I always did my best, I always was there for you without question. And I was good enough. 

And if you ever truly need me. Call, I‚Äôm here.

 I have so much more to say, but I'm tired of writing to the void you left. I want to talk to you. 

Before I go, you should know I loved you every day. You should know I am in constant awe of you. That I would‚Äôve given you everything I possibly could. I just want you to be happy. Surrounded by love. To never know what it is to struggle. To always feel supported. To know your beauty both inside and outside. How captivating I find you to be. I am eternally grateful to have lived the same time as you. To have gotten the experience of knowing you. I wish everything were different, but it‚Äôs not.

I know you asked for no contact.

I‚Äôll give you your space,

I‚Äôll respect your boundaries.

If you ever reach out.

Check your house collection first.

1nrp4mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalDev/comments/1nrp4mw/people_dealing_with_shattered_int_dev_dreams_how/,"People dealing with shattered Int. Dev. dreams, how did you process and move on?","For context I was a finance and insolvency lawyer working for five years in South Asia, decided that this life was not for me, had always dreamt of working in Int. Dev. in an IO or MDB, and using this career move to move away to an LGBT-friendly city. I went through the motions, got myself the flagship degree from IHEID, and alongside my second year, worked for a year in a dev-focussed role in a prestigious law firm in Geneva, channeling trade and commercial law pro bono advice to small businesses across developing countries. It really was the life of my dreams while it lasted, but the law firm couldn‚Äòt confirm my trainee contract when my student status ended. 

I had already spent months trying to land something in the Geneva ecosystem. I‚Äôm not from a particularly well off family, and the loans I had to pay back for this degree meant that I stayed away from unpaid internship gigs. When not even calls for interviews came through, I even decided to abandon that last guardrail, rationalizing it as ‚Äôan extension of my masters‚Äò that I‚Äôll ask my dad for help with if the need arises. This would be a significant burden for him - he earns less today, 34 years into his career, than I did in my fifth year of my lawyer gig. I landed two interviews. One with the UNCTAD, one with ITC, both of them seemed to go well, The UNCTAD, however, responded (on the record) that while they were ‚Äúvery impressed with your CV‚Äù, they could not give me the internship because of the gender balance requirements at the UN at that time. They asked me if I‚Äôll be interested in a different internship opening up with them in a few months, ‚Äòmore in line with your qualifications‚Äô, to which I eagerly responded with a ‚Äòyes‚Äô. The UNCTAD followed up with me of their own accord months later, asking if I‚Äôm still interested, set up an interview with me (which I also thought went well), and then ghosted me, without response to my follow ups. 

The ITC seemed to imply my interview went well, confirmed my availability for a series of potential internship slots, ghosted me for three months, and then asked for my availability again, and then ghosted me again, for good. 

I took the hints I should have from the state of the market, of course, and tried applying for other things that fit with my idea of what I want to do, IOs‚Äô offices right here in my home country (that pay so little for the same positions that are very well compensated in Geneva, that I‚Äòd have to live with my parents to afford debt service). MDBs, MDBs focussed on Asia and Southeast Asia, junior positions, temporary positions, NGOs, an academic diplomacy initiative with the Swiss embassy in my home country - nothing but radio silence, cheeky assessments I‚Äôd write and hear nothing of after, or interviews that seem to go well but result in nothing.

I did try networking my way into these places, but either I had less goodwill than I thought, or I just am bad at this. My silly little emails and silly little coffee chats requests are either ignored, at times by people I sat across in dozens of meetings with, or just don‚Äôt really impact anything.

Now that all my savings from the law firm gig in Geneva have dried up, and my freelance teaching gigs are no longer cutting it, after a full year of waking up and hating that another day has begun, I‚Äôve started applying to the same kind of work I had promised myself I‚Äòd never do again in my life, finance law in a firm right here. And in these situations, I‚Äôm having to justify my little adventure in Switzerland, because it provokes doubt, ‚Äòwhy did you do that and then come back to this, how do we know you‚Äôre here to stay‚Äô et al, my next interview is with a firm to which I applied with my IHEID degree removed from my CV, because someone with great insight in the industry suggested it‚Äôd ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. 

I can‚Äôt overstate how much this has eroded  everything that forms my idea of self. I had two great degrees, work experience that sounds good in narration, I also speak 9 languages, 6 of them at B2 and above with published creative writing in all of them, including Spanish, French, Italian and Japanese, and this is where I find myself. 

I know the industry is bad, but I can‚Äôt stop rerunning everything in my head, HOW did I manage to eff things up THIS BAD? What could I have done differently? I really just wanted out, into a place where I wouldn‚Äôt have to live a double life, and maybe I chose the worst possible path for this. But then I also wonder if this is just me making myself a victim of circumstance, because there are people, many people, who did manage to make it work, what is my excuse? I hate the version of myself that signed my freedom away (because not like I can do something radical like teach Spanish in a school while I‚Äòm still repaying student loans) for this degree, and at times I think of setting fire to it just for the happy cathartic release.

At this point the only thing I hope to figure out is how to break this loop of thinking of what ‚Äôwent wrong‚Äô, of constantly running the last years in my head on repeat wondering what I could have done to make things work out.  This jarring refrain in my head of ‚Äòwas it me? Was it the market? Was it Trump?‚Äò

If anyone has been in a place like this, I‚Äôd love to hear of you, and how you came to terms with your life not unravelling in the way you had hoped. ",7,1758958444.0,InternationalDev,0,1.0,False

I recently made the switch from a Rocket Appartamento + Eureka Perfetto to a LM Micra + Pico Grinder. First of all - super happy with my purchase, this is a huuge upgrade from a lot of different perspectives.

One thing I observed after using the new setup for a week: 
I usually drink a flat white in the morning, then 2-3 hours later (machine on standby) another one. I always use light roast specialty coffee.
The first shot always tastes differently (fruitier) from the second one with roughly the same extraction time & output. I do not single dose, but refresh beans in the hopper every 1-2 days and measure my puck.
This leads me to the conclusion that the second shot seems to have a higher brew temp than the first one, but of course I can‚Äôt just measure it. Heatup time should not be the issue, in the morning I do at least 15 mins, second shot around 10mins. 

As I‚Äôm new to this machine I‚Äôm wondering if this is normal? I can think of a few workarounds that I want to try, but I want to make sure that my machine is working properly.

I know group meet-ups can be a bit overwhelming for us introverts, So why not meet one on one at a cafe and just hangout and talk about life over coffee. I am burnt out of my existing circle and same old conversations and in life too lately.  
I am 29M and we can talk about Tech, Cars, The stock market, Games, F1 and a lot more.  
Big ups if you're an app developer and have some free time to work on a project alongside.

Sure go ahead and mention your interests in the comments and meet your kinda people too. Goodluck :)",0,1758956889.0,ahmedabad,1,0.5,False

First one was about 18 months ago, I was casually talking to myself with my internal dialogue about God the universe and everything in it, and I casually put of the blue heard my internal dialogue say "" The next person you shake the hand of will be the creator of the universe"" I thought this was impossible and thought I'd shake someone's hand that day if someone offered their hand to me, but that might I went to sleep, this is about 4 hours after the dialogue then when I was asleep this is what happened.
First I wake up in my dream, I'm completely lucid and look around I'm in a small room, with heaps of TV monitors from the early 90s I'm sitting down on a couch I see out of the corner of my eye something shinning and I turn and see a portal open to my right, then a man's hands come out of it and he pulls his self out of the portal, then he walks in front of me I stand up and he offers to shake my hand so I get up and shake his hand, and I remember specifically thinking my body is asleep in the.other world, and then I felt real sensation of touch and a sort of static electricity and I remember thinking "" holy shit I can actually feel for the first time while I'm dreaming"" then one of us not sure if it was me or him said "" I knew it would be better"" then he walks off to a corner of the screen and I believe he sat down at a computer, I stood still and looked around the room again then the whole place started to shake and I woke up, and thought after I woke up holy shit I actually felt real touch and the electricity in dream reality... So I was stunned.

Fast forward about 3 months, again I'm talking to myself about my books I created about spirituality and our immortal essence, and I fell asleep this is when I was recently trying to induce lucid dreaming and had some progress and experiences like flying or touching grass while lucid and growing a tree, I fell asleep and this time it was more like a dream to begin with, I was standing in a room with a door and there was a floating giant head to the left top corner of my vision, the dream was quite long this time I was vading in and out of lucid state then I eventually start to walk up some stairs I go through a door, I remember feeling like this is my apartment, I sit down on the couch there is two couches , a coffee table with a state of a dog, and a really giant TV In front of me, once I sit down I heard a voice say "" It's time"" I instantly know what to do I jump up and start walking to the TV, the statue as I get closer turns into a girl and she goes to my right side and we both start walking into the TV, it feels like walking through rain but it was getting darker and darker for about 20 seconds, then it goes pitch black I have a feeling sensation like my previous dream and then I open my eyes and I'm sitting in front of a computer I instantly look down at the clock and it says 2100 1st of the 1st at 1:11. Then someone taps my shoulder and says "" you've been on that all day"" now I know its am, then I turn around and take off my headset and I remember thinking ""she is beautiful"" then she starts to talk and says"" Hi I'm a horologist, did you hear about the event above the skies of Canada"" then I think to myself ""Ask 5 questions good and bad that happened in the last 80 years"" then It turns to pitch black, again I have a feeling sensation of going back through the portal and I wake up before I could actually say that question. 

So, yeah that's my two dream reality stories of me lucid dreaming both are connected and I've had numerous others but non directly connected to the same type of portal system, first I saw the creator come through a portal then I actually went through one myself 3 months later.

has anyone else felt in their dreams, I know this is usually disabled because of death and pain in dreams but in this one I actually completely felt and the reality was a perfect replica of this reality, also have you's ever gone through a TV or portal like this?

Thanks for reading curious about your experiences too.

i told him that if it were expensive he should‚Äôve told me and we could‚Äôve gone elsewhere but he doubled down and said that I chose the place (even though he was the one who suggested it)

he seems offended that i didn‚Äôt agree to pay for everything right away that night and guilt tripped me saying that i made him pay so much already when we went out before (which both bills overall totaled 200php and tonight was 4,000php alone) so it‚Äôs my turn to pay for our night out.

was i at fault for not paying the first two times? did i really need to pay the third time? I think I would‚Äôve understood if it was in the same ballpark for the price as our hang outs before and if he asked me beforehand to pay, but he assumed that i was going to and didn‚Äôt say that until after we arrived, and all three times he was the one asking me to go out with him.

1nrobug,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1nrobug/how_to_incorporate_collagen_peptides_into_your/,How to Incorporate Collagen Peptides Into Your Daily Routine,"Collagen peptides are a popular supplement known for their potential to support skin elasticity, joint health, and overall vitality. With so many benefits, it‚Äôs no wonder that many are looking for ways to incorporate them into their daily routine. Fortunately, adding collagen peptides to your lifestyle is simple, and there are numerous creative methods to make it part of your day.

**1. Morning Smoothies**  
One of the easiest ways to include collagen peptides in your routine is by adding them to your morning smoothie. Simply scoop a serving of collagen powder into your favorite blend of fruits, vegetables, and liquid. Since collagen peptides are tasteless and dissolve easily, they won‚Äôt affect the flavor or texture. A smoothie can be an energizing way to start the day while reaping the health benefits of collagen.

**2. Coffee or Tea**  
If you‚Äôre a coffee or tea drinker, collagen peptides are a perfect addition to your hot beverage. Just stir a scoop of collagen powder into your coffee, tea, or even hot cocoa. Since it blends well without clumping, it can seamlessly become part of your morning ritual. Many people enjoy the added bonus of knowing their collagen is supporting their skin, hair, and joints throughout the day.

**3. Baking and Cooking**  
Another fun way to use collagen peptides is by incorporating them into your favorite baked goods or meals. From muffins to pancakes to savory dishes like soups and stews, collagen powder is an easy ingredient to sneak into recipes. It‚Äôs heat-stable, so it won‚Äôt lose its benefits when exposed to cooking temperatures. This is a great option for those who prefer savory meals or need a little extra protein in their diet.

**4. Collagen-Infused Water or Beverages**  
For those who prefer a refreshing and hydrating option, collagen peptides can be dissolved into water, flavored waters, or even lemon water. There are plenty of ways to add flavor to your collagen drink without added sugar, such as using a few drops of natural fruit extract or fresh lemon juice. This option can be a great way to keep yourself hydrated while still enjoying the benefits of collagen.

**5. Pre-Workout Boost**  
For fitness enthusiasts, collagen peptides can also be an excellent pre-workout addition. Collagen provides amino acids that support muscles and joints, making it a beneficial supplement for both pre-and post-exercise. Simply stir some into your pre-workout drink or water for an extra boost during your workout.

Incorporating **collagen peptides** into your daily routine is a simple yet effective way to enhance your overall health and well-being. Whether you‚Äôre adding it to your smoothie, coffee, or meals, the versatility of collagen peptides ensures that there‚Äôs a convenient method for everyone. As you include this supplement into your lifestyle, you may begin to notice improvements in your skin's elasticity, hair growth, and joint mobility.",1,1758955452.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False
1nrobd8,https://i.redd.it/7w9e0t4hlnrf1.jpeg,1988 Die Hard Movie,"The movie poster depicts a building that is seized by terrorists, however at first glance the building seems to resemble the twin towers pre-'911'. The building also covers john mcclanes right eye which is a symbol prevalent in modern times which signifies the one-eyed anti-christ. The one-eyed anti-christ blind in the right eye (which defines the eye of inner realities) will be a person that appears in the end of times that will claim to be a prophet of God and then later claim to be god. 

In the opening scene of the movie, a conversation happens on the plane between a salesman and officer mcclane as follows:

SALESMAN'S VOICE
                  You don't like flying, do you?

        McClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him.  Caught,
        he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear.

                                 MCCLANE
                  No, no, where'd you get that idea?

                                 SALESMAN
                         (smiling)
                  Ya wanna know the secret of successful
                  air travel?  After you get where you're
                  going, ya take off your shoes and socks.
                  Then ya walk around on the rug barefoot
                  and make fists with your toes.

                                 MCCLANE
                  Fists with your toes.

                                 SALESMAN
                  Maybe it's not a fist when it's your
                  toes...I mean like this...work out
                  that time zone tension.
                         (demonstrating)
                  Better'n a cup of coffee and a hot
                  shower for the old jet lag.  I know
                  it sounds crazy.  Trust me.  I've
                  been doing it for nine years.

        The plane stops.  Passengers rise, start to take down overhead
        luggage.  McClane does this, but as he opens the door above,
        the businessman BLANCHES seeing:

3-A     HIS P.O.V. - MCCLANE'S BARETTA PISTOL                  3-A 

        Peeking out from his jacket.

3-B     BACK TO SCENE                                          3-B 

        Recognizing the look, McClane smiles reassuringly.

                                 MCCLANE
                  It's okay.
                         (showing badge)
                  I'm a cop.
                         (pause)
                  Trust me.  I've been doing it for
                  eleven.

The salesman assures Mcclane that the trick to relief the tension post-flying works as he has been trying this for 9 years.

Mcclane, on the other hand, assures the salesman, who notices the pistol peeking out of his jacket, that he's a cop and that he's been doing it for 11 years.


Things that set the buzzer off:
1. The resemblance of twin towers 
2. The opening scene on a plane
3. A salesman
4. 9 years
5. 11 years

Here are **three essential tips** that‚Äôll help you ride that hype train like a pro without derailing your creativity.

1. **Experiment Boldly üí•**
   - AI is all about experimentation. Don‚Äôt be afraid to play around! Whether it‚Äôs generating content ideas or using AI for editing, dive in and try different tools.
   - Think about it: how does your favorite content creator find their unique voice? A little trial and error can lead to unbelievable insights. 
   - Here‚Äôs a fun idea: take a subject you love (like cats üê± or conspiracy theories üåå) and see how AI can help spin it into something *completely different*.

2. **Stay Authentic ü§ó**
   - You know your audience better than anyone. The blend of AI tools and your authentic voice is what will resonate. So, sprinkle some of your personality into everything you create.
   - Remember that viral post you made? The one where you shared that embarrassing story about your first job? Those real moments connect with people. Use AI to enhance your stories, not to replace them.
   - Pro-tip: Throw in some humor! Readers love a little wit. Who doesn‚Äôt chuckle at an AI-generated cat meme?

3. **Learn & Adapt üìö**
   - The AI landscape changes fast, like your friend who watches every episode of a new series before you even hit ‚Äúplay.‚Äù Make it a habit to stay updated on the best AI tools. Oh, and speaking of tools, have you checked out [Easy Peasy AI](https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca)? It‚Äôs a gem for those diving into the AI world!

When people think of Dubai‚Äôs most iconic developments, Palm Jumeirah is usually the first image that comes to mind. Shaped like a giant palm tree reaching into the Arabian Gulf, it has become a global symbol of ambition and innovation. For many investors and homeowners, buying here is not just about securing property but becoming part of a landmark that defines modern Dubai. Families drawn to this area often see it as the pinnacle of [Jumeirah living](https://keyspacedubai.com/palm-jumeirah-properties/), where comfort, exclusivity, and waterfront beauty merge into one lifestyle.

# The Lifestyle Appeal

Palm Jumeirah is attractive because of the unique way it blends luxury and leisure. Residents wake up to panoramic views of the sea, with many homes offering direct access to Palm Jumeirah Beach. The island‚Äôs design allows homeowners to enjoy privacy while still being connected to restaurants, resorts, and entertainment venues. Palm Jumeirah villas, in particular, are in high demand because they provide large spaces, private pools, and beachfront living that‚Äôs ideal for families or for hosting gatherings. This is where jumeirah luxury living becomes a reality, as daily routines feel more like a holiday than ordinary city life.

# World-Class Amenities

Life on the island also means being surrounded by first-class amenities. Whether you‚Äôre dining in an upscale restaurant or grabbing coffee at a casual caf√©, the choices are endless. The community is also home to some of the most famous Palm Jumeirah hotels, including Atlantis The Palm and Jumeirah Zabeel Saray, both of which attract international visitors while doubling as lifestyle destinations for residents. Living near a Palm Jumeirah hotel gives locals easy access to spas, gyms, and beach clubs. In fact, Palm Jumeirah hotels are so renowned that even residents from other parts of Dubai often come here for weekend getaways or special events. For those living on the island, this means world-class experiences are always just minutes away.

# Investment Potential

For investors, Dubai Palm Jumeirah continues to represent a reliable and prestigious choice. Property values here hold strong because the island has built an enduring reputation as one of the city‚Äôs most exclusive addresses. Apartments with sea views and Palm Jumeirah villas with direct beach access generate high rental yields thanks to steady demand from both locals and international buyers. Even when Dubai‚Äôs wider market sees fluctuations, Palm Jumeirah tends to remain resilient. Investors looking for stable long-term opportunities often prioritize the island, knowing its global recognition ensures lasting value.

Those who want to expand their search beyond Palm Jumeirah can benefit from expert advice through[ Keyspace Real Estate](https://keyspacerealty.com/), which offers tailored guidance and access to premium listings across the UAE. Similarly,[ Keyspace Dubai](https://keyspacedubai.com/) specializes in some of the city‚Äôs most exclusive projects, helping buyers compare opportunities on Palm Jumeirah with other prime communities to ensure they make the right decision.

# The Pros of Buying on Palm Jumeirah

The benefits of living here are hard to ignore. First, the island is known worldwide, and owning property here brings an unmatched sense of prestige. Second, the location is highly convenient, with schools, health centers, and shopping malls a short drive away. Third, homes are built with luxury in mind, offering spacious layouts, high-quality finishes, and natural light that enhances the sense of openness. Lastly, Palm Jumeirah is a secure community with gated access and services designed for comfort, making it especially appealing for families who want both privacy and convenience.

# The Cons to Consider

Despite the many advantages, buying property on Palm Jumeirah does come with challenges. Prices are among the highest in Dubai, which can make it difficult for first-time buyers or families on a tighter budget. Maintenance costs can also be higher, particularly for Palm Jumeirah villas with private pools and landscaped beachfronts. Another factor is traffic, as the island has limited entry and exit points that can become congested during peak hours. While the community feels self-contained, traveling to other parts of Dubai may take longer compared to more central locations.

# Comparing Palm Jumeirah to Other Communities

Palm Jumeirah stands out when compared to other areas of Dubai. Downtown Dubai, for example, offers city views and a vibrant nightlife, while suburban neighborhoods like Arabian Ranches focus on family-friendly living in a quieter setting. Dubai Palm Jumeirah is different because it combines elements of both: the privacy of an exclusive island and the convenience of being near world-class entertainment. For many buyers, it offers the best of both worlds and sets a new benchmark for jumeirah living in the city.

# A Blend of Home and Holiday

What makes Palm Jumeirah truly special is how it transforms everyday life into something closer to a vacation. Whether you‚Äôre spending a day on Palm Jumeirah Beach, relaxing at a resort spa, or dining in a rooftop lounge at a Palm Jumeirah hotel, the island delivers experiences most people associate with travel. Jumeirah luxury living here is about more than just impressive architecture or large homes; it‚Äôs about the balance of leisure, security, and beauty that comes with living by the water. Families enjoy outdoor weekends, couples indulge in fine dining, and children grow up in an environment that feels both safe and vibrant.

# Making the Decision

Buying property on Palm Jumeirah offers clear advantages, from iconic status and stunning waterfront views to a lifestyle designed for luxury. At the same time, buyers must weigh higher costs and occasional traffic congestion. For many, the rewards far outweigh the drawbacks, making it a dream location to call home. For others, the exclusivity might not match their lifestyle or budget. What remains certain is that Palm Jumeirah will continue to be one of the most desirable places to live in Dubai.

Ever wake up feeling like you've just run a marathon in your sleep? You know, that morning stiffness where even your morning coffee feels heavy? I‚Äôve been there, and let me tell you, it's not a great start to the day. 

But here‚Äôs the thing: In just **ten minutes**, you can kick that stiffness to the curb! So, which do you think is better for regaining your energy‚Äî a gentle morning mobility routine or a quick afternoon nap? Let‚Äôs break it down!

**Morning Mobility Routine:** üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

- **Get your body moving**: It‚Äôs not about hitting the gym hard; think simple stretches and gentle movements. 
- **Boosts your mood**: What‚Äôs better than starting the day with a little endorphin boost? You'll feel like a million bucks.
- **Sets the tone for the day**: You‚Äôll be surprised how a few stretches can help you feel more focused and ready to tackle whatever life throws your way. 

**A Quick Afternoon Nap:** üò¥

- **Power up**: Sometimes, a short nap can be just what your brain needs to recharge and improve your productivity.
- **Watch out for the snooze trap**: It can feel heavenly, but too long a nap can leave you groggy and even stiffer than before!

1nrnxo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1nrnxo9/help_me_stop_drinking_please/,"Help me stop drinking, please?","Hi friends, 

I had almost completely stopped drinking and felt really good. 

I then lost my mum and fell back into bad habits. 

I started up again. I like the ritual of a drink at the end of a day  (much like a coffee in the AM). But now I‚Äôm drinking daily again. When before mum passed, I rarely drank at all. 

I prefer life sober. But I‚Äôm struggling to live that way. I feel so fragile. Like the only way I can get through the day is to have a bottle of wine under my belt. But I don‚Äôt want this to be my life. My mum‚Äôs death hit me much harder than I imagined it would. But honestly, I should be stronger anyway. 

So, given I am much more weak and fragile than I‚Äôve ever been in my life before. Please give me your tips to reduce or completely stop drinking under the current circumstances. I‚Äôm struggling to make sense of everything right now and I really don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going or what I‚Äôm doing and I just need a bit of help because alcohol while some days it feels like it helps, at the end of the day it really doesn‚Äôt. I want to be 100% sober. But I just feel really weak right now and I don‚Äôt know what step to take next. I‚Äôm finding life really hard. I want to be numb to it all but I know that‚Äôs not the answer. I really don‚Äôt know what to do so if anyone has advice, I‚Äôd love to hear it.",4,1758953967.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False

1nrnx6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1nrnx6v/is_a_portable_generator_worth_it_for_camping_trips/,Is a portable generator worth it for camping trips?,"Hey fellow campers! I've been an avid outdoors enthusiast for over a decade now, and I wanted to share my thoughts on portable generators for camping - something I wish I knew about when I first started.

I remember my first camping trips where I struggled without power, trying to keep my phone charged for emergencies and dealing with warm food from the cooler. That all changed when I invested in a portable generator, and honestly, it's been a game-changer.

Let me break down why I think it's worth considering:

Power for Essentials
Whether you're camping in an RV or tent camping, having reliable power for basic needs is crucial. I can charge my devices, run a small fan during hot summer nights, and even power a coffee maker (because let's face it, camp coffee isn't always the best). Check out some great options here: https://athometouch.com/portable-generator

Safety Considerations
Having emergency power can be a lifesaver. I've been in situations where weather turned bad, and having a powered radio and charged phone made a huge difference. It's not just about comfort - it's about safety too.

Noise and Environmental Impact
Modern portable generators are surprisingly quiet. I was worried about disturbing the peace of nature, but newer models run quietly and are fuel-efficient. Some even have eco-modes that adjust power output based on what you're using.

Cost vs. Benefit
While the initial investment might seem high, think about the long-term benefits. I've found that having a reliable power source has allowed me to camp longer and more comfortably. Plus, these units are versatile - I use mine for home backup power too.

Some Pro Tips from Experience:
- Always check campground regulations about generator use
- Consider inverter generators for sensitive electronics
- Calculate your power needs before buying
- Look for fuel efficiency and runtime

If you're on the fence about getting one, I'd recommend checking out some options here: https://athometouch.com/portable-generator. The variety available now is impressive, and there's something for every budget and need.

Maintenance is pretty straightforward too. Regular oil changes, clean fuel, and proper storage have kept mine running perfectly for years. It's definitely been one of my best camping investments.

Remember though, while generators are great, they shouldn't take away from the camping experience. I mainly use mine for necessities and occasional comforts, keeping the focus on enjoying nature.

What are your thoughts on using generators while camping? Have you had any experiences, good or bad, with them? I'd love to hear your perspectives!",1,1758953918.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False
1nrnwus,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Farhanamili/comments/1nrnwus/stand_up_pouch_the_modern_packaging_solution_for/,Stand Up Pouch: The Modern Packaging Solution for Every Industry,"In today‚Äôs fast-paced consumer-driven world, packaging plays a critical role not only in protecting products but also in shaping purchasing decisions. One of the most innovative and versatile packaging options available today is the **stand-up pouch**. Known for its durability, practicality, and attractive shelf presence, the [**stand up pouch**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-standard-bag-style/stand-up-bag) has become the go-to choice for a wide range of industries including food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and pet supplies. With features like resealable zippers, spouts, and customizable designs, this packaging format provides convenience for consumers while offering businesses a sustainable and cost-effective option. As markets grow increasingly competitive, the stand-up pouch continues to prove itself as a game-changing solution that blends functionality with modern aesthetics.

The primary advantage of the stand-up pouch lies in its ability to protect the contents inside. Unlike traditional packaging such as glass jars, tin cans, or rigid plastic containers, stand up pouches are constructed with multiple laminated layers that provide excellent barrier protection against moisture, oxygen, light, and contaminants. This ensures that products such as coffee, dried fruits, snacks, sauces, and even liquid detergents maintain their freshness and quality for a longer time. Moreover, the material is puncture-resistant, reducing the risk of damage during transportation and storage. The stand up design allows the pouch to remain upright on shelves, giving it greater visibility and appeal compared to flat bags. This functional feature has made it a top choice for retailers and manufacturers looking to enhance product presentation and customer trust.

Another major benefit of stand-up pouches is their consumer-friendly design. Today‚Äôs shoppers' value convenience and stand-up pouches deliver exactly that. Resealable zippers and spouts allow customers to open, use, and close the package multiple times without compromising freshness. For busy households, this means less food waste and greater ease of use. Lightweight and portable, stand up pouches are also travel-friendly, making them ideal for on-the-go snacks, baby food, or energy drinks. From portion-controlled packaging to bulk-sized options, these pouches can be customized to suit varying needs. Furthermore, their flexibility in design and printing gives businesses the freedom to highlight brand stories, nutritional facts, and eye-catching graphics, which can significantly influence a customer‚Äôs decision at the point of sale.

From an environmental perspective, stand up pouches are a step forward in sustainable packaging. Unlike rigid packaging materials that require more plastic, glass, or metal, pouches are made using significantly less raw material, which translates to reduced carbon emissions during production. Their lightweight nature also means lower transportation costs and energy use, since more units can be shipped at once. Many manufacturers are now experimenting with recyclable and compostable stand-up pouches to meet growing consumer demand for eco-friendly packaging. This aligns well with the global shift toward reducing single-use plastics and adopting circular economy practices. As governments and organizations implement stricter regulations on packaging waste, stand up pouches are positioned as a forward-looking solution that balances environmental responsibility with commercial viability.

The versatility of stand-up pouches across industries is another reason for their widespread adoption. In the food and beverage sector, they are used for packaging coffee, tea, snacks, frozen foods, sauces, juices, and alcoholic beverages. In the pet care industry, they provide an ideal solution for dry kibble, treats, and wet food. For non-food items, such as detergents, fertilizers, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, stand up pouches offer a hygienic and space-saving alternative to bulky containers. Additionally, advancements in pouch technology now allow manufacturers to integrate unique features such as transparent windows, hang holes, and QR codes, enhancing both functionality and marketing. This adaptability ensures that regardless of the product type, a stand-up pouch can be designed to meet its specific requirements, making it one of the most flexible and future-ready packaging options available today.

In conclusion, the **stand-up pouch** has transformed modern packaging by providing an innovative solution that addresses both consumer and business needs. Its protective qualities ensure product freshness and safety, while its convenient design offers unmatched usability for everyday life. With increasing emphasis on sustainability, stand up pouches help companies reduce their environmental footprint while maintaining strong brand visibility and cost efficiency. Their versatility across multiple industries highlights their importance in the evolving packaging landscape. As consumer expectations continue to shift toward convenience, aesthetics, and eco-consciousness, the stand-up pouch will remain at the forefront of packaging innovation, shaping the way products are stored, shipped, and displayed around the world.",1,1758953887.0,u_Farhanamili,0,1.0,False

I apologise for what might be a commonly themed question, and one of the current top posts is a very similar setup to what I'm aiming for but as you all seem helpful I thought I'd post looking for feedback.

I'm from the UK. My Sage Barista Express is having issues after 3 years, the cause of which I believe is the solenoid valve. We're not DIY people and would like to get a new machine.

I'm very tempted to get a separate grinder and espresso machine for a comparable price. This would reduce future replacement costs and I've read it improves shots. Getting a DF54 and a Bambino works out at ¬£20 more than just an express - and that's one on offer to boot. I think the Bambino would be better than the plus due to no solenoid (less likely to break maybe) and I don't need auto frothing. 

We will miss the aesthetic of our express, we love the look. Has anyone else made the jump down? Were there things you missed about your express? Will the Bambino rattle or move around a lot more? Will I produce better coffee this way? Or should I buy another express?

Thanks for any advice.",1,1758953706.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
