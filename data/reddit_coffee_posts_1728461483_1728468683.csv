1fznxgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1fznxgc/i_dont_think_my_baby_is_getting_enough_sleep/,I don‚Äôt think my baby is getting enough sleep. ,"My 11 week old baby is getting maybe 9-12 hours sleep a day and going by the internet she should be getting closer to 16 hours a day minimum. We‚Äôre finding this really stressful and are doing everything we can to encourage sleep. At night we have a bath routine starting from about 8pm. Usually after the bath and a feed she will nap for 30 minutes then she‚Äôs up, inconsolable until about 1am. We take shots each trying to rock her, comfort her, feed her the boob but nothing gets her there. When she does finally go down she‚Äôs up every 1 or 2 hours. We‚Äôve had 3 nights in total since she was born where she managed to sleep for 6 hours but we just can‚Äôt replicate it. 

Naps are a big issue we do everything to get her to sleep during the day and she just fights it with everything she has. She will be so close to drifting off, then out of nowhere her eyes are wired like she‚Äôs just had a coffee. 

She hates being put down, she hates a dummy, hates a bottle she just wants to be lying on her mum with the boob always just a little stretch away.

Even contact naps are getting less and less effective she just doesn‚Äôt seem to be tired, or goes from tired to wide awake as we‚Äôre trying to get her to sleep. 

I just don‚Äôt get it she just doesn‚Äôt want to sleep and fights it with every fibre of her being. Has anyone had similar babies? What can we do? 

Both mum and I are starting to stress both because we are all sleep deprived but worried our baby isn‚Äôt sleeping enough so won‚Äôt be developing properly ",1,1728468508.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False

1fzntm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1fzntm3/what_exactly_happens_when_using_the_pomodoro/,What Exactly Happens When Using the Pomodoro Interval Technique,"1. **Automatic Breakdown of Large or Vague Tasks.**¬†If I say, ""I need to write an article today,"" what kind of thought process will follow? ""Okay, I need to first think about what to write about..."", ""I need to really think this through,"" ""I'll have a coffee and think about it, yeah,"" ""I'll work on something else for now since the ideas haven't come yet,"" ""I'll take a walk, and it'll give me time to think,"" ""Oh! Right before bed is the best time, instead of watching YouTube, I'll think about it."" Now let's approach it differently: I say, ""I'll set a timer for 25 minutes, and I'll get something done on the article."" After 25 minutes, you'll either have a list of potential topics or one topic with some core points outlined. The brain is given a task to complete something in 25 minutes, and it surprisingly quickly finds what can realistically be achieved in that time frame, something that can be considered a result, leading to a dopamine hit for achieving a goal.
2. **No Procrastination.**¬†Usually, for the first 25-minute session, my task is simply to pour a coffee, turn on the computer, launch all the necessary programs, and write down what I plan to do today. Every single time, I find that within 5 minutes, I'm already fully working, even though at first, it felt like ""today just isn't the day."" So, the very process of getting into work mode becomes its own task with a time limit.
3. **You Know Exactly When It Will End.**¬†When creating an interval schedule, the total time is displayed. The brain understands that during this time, it just needs to give in and fully commit.
4. **Easily Fit Small Tasks During Breaks.**¬†Breaks are legitimate, following an approved technique. You get 5 minutes, and after 4 cycles, a full 15-minute break. This is part of the structure, and it makes you quickly find what fits into these intervals. The simplest things are exercise or home chores (cleaning, tidying up).
5. **At the End of the Session, You‚Äôll Feel Energized Instead of Tired.**¬†Your brain will have worked in its optimal mode, and along the way, other tasks will have been accomplished‚Äîlike working out some muscles or getting household chores done.",1,1728468064.0,GetStudying,1,1.0,False

Can easily spending hours in a good independent bookshop or dusty museum. Not especially sporty or a heavy drinker but I regularly go to gigs and festivals. Often to be found on long exploratory trips out and about with my camera and would welcome a companion.

Love travelling and often spend a couple of weeks each summer in Berlin. Also into camping trips, theatre visits and meals out with friends.

- 5'7, moreno, and on the lean and athletic side
- I'm 37 but look much younger.
- Living in the accessible part of QC(Cubao/Katipunan) and I drive.
- I have two modes: 0 to 100 real quick. I almost never exhibit anything in the middle.
- I talk a lot about a lot of things as long as you're open to chatting about various topics.
- Still into anime, manga and video games but also a gym enjoyer
- Still learning things about myself
- I drink coffee like it's water. ü§§

Hopefully, you:
- are free this evening.
- are in or around Katipunan and nearby cities. I can also pick you up if you're reasonably near.
- Not overly specific with built but I'm all about the waist to hip ratio. ++ for tiny girls.
- Genetically or biologically young (20 ish?) or cuz I really look young, no joke.
- You also believe coffee is good any time of the day.
- A real gym enjoyer is a huge plus! Buuut not just someone that has a membership and barely uses it. üò∂
- Conversational and open to discourse, but not to the point na mema lang. I'm not looking for 200IQ convos but I get bored of a lot of small talk and chismis.
- I'm open to traveling to you if you're just a reasonable distance from me. üòÅ

I used to wake up at 7a and it felt like morning - I‚Äôm in perpetual nothingness ,"That morning feeling, getting up at 7a and seeing the sun rise, the cold air, the sunshine, the way the light hit the trees and buildings, the smell of coffee, feeling refreshed from sleeping good that night.

I experience none of that anymore. I wake up drained, barely able to open my eyes. Doesn't matter what time it is 7a or 4p - it all feels exactly the same. There's no sense of time, what season it is, that any time has passed. For example, I'll talk to the front desk guy at my building at 7p and see him again at 11a the next day and it's like I was just talking to him- no time passed. I can't even fathom that I've lived in my apt for over a year - because I haven't been ""here""'in my body to experience it.

You can't possibly explain this to anyone who hasn't lived it. Try having horribly vivid trauma dreams all night and waking up to not even feeling like you've slept, like no time has passed. Completely disconnected and detached from where you are, what time it is, what season it is, who you are. I used to wake up and lay in bed for hours on Sunday - it was my cozy place and hours felt like hours. I don't feel time at all. 6 hours could go by in 30 seconds. 5 days in what feels like hours. Months feel like weeks. I've been living this chronically 24/7 for 2 years now - life used to be so REAL and VIBRANT. There was so much complexity and depth to it. I've overcome so much of my anxiety and reducing my stress. But DPDR hasn't left for even a second. I feel less and less myself as time goes on. All my insecurities, cares, passions, connections, feelings, personality, traits / all of it is gone. I don't really know what to do, my life has become a never ending day of nothingness. I can't find meaning or feeling in anything, not even the smallest things. It's not because I don't want to, my mind won't let me feel anything, even time itself.

I have done some insane diets for years only to fail and go up to 130+ kg within months. 

I have tries CICO but eating less 4-5 times a day only makes me more hungry with ups and downs. 

I started with a week of 18-6 fasting and was feeling good so went for a 24h that was kind of hard the first 2 days but now it's nothing. 
For the past 4 weeks I eat one meal at 18:00 monday - Friday ""1200-1800 kcal high protein"" depending on how hungry I am. I do drink 2-3 cups of coffee at work with about 2cl of milk ""I can't stand 100 black coffee.""

I did try a 48h fast but quit at 36 because I was starting to feel sickly ""went away with a little food"" but will try again in the future. 

I take electrolyte supplements ""magnesium, zink, potassium and kalcium and salt ofc"" again thank you for all the tips. 

I go for 10km walks 2-4 times a week depending on weather. I have a rowing machine at home and I have barbells + free weights that I try to use the other days. 

I love my withing scale because week 3 I went up 2kg and I could see it was not me doing something wrong but only water because I had eaten lots of carbs at the weekend. 

I know this is not the most interesting progress post ever because i have only been going for this short amount of time but I got great plans and will keep updating. I already can see results and feeling better then ever. 

I'm aiming for under 100 to next year's Swedish midsummer celebration that's 0,7kg a week because I know it will probably not be as easy as it has been now where I average about 1,3-1,5 kg a week. 

Again thank you all for the tips and motivation!

I can't say I feel a positive about all my colleagues, but it's fine. We can't all be friends. 
But there is this guy, now in his 2nd year of PhD, that I don't know what to do with. 

He was rather friendly a year ago, not exactly someone I wanted to go out drinking with or whatever, but it was fine. 

During the Winter break I would leave the city and the PI asked this guy -who supposedly had experience with cell line work- to thaw some of my cells in the first days of January in order to have them ready for work as soon as I came back. 
I left him notes, I showed him my technique and all, including solutions, was already prepared.

Alas, this wasn't enough. 
He asked me to share my protocol as a file. I forgot to do so until the day before he would have to go in the lab. 
This is my bad, I know. He had my notes and all, so I forgot to share the full protocol until the last moment. Not exactly a big thing, but I can understand it annoying him (albeit, if it was so important, he could have asked through a message of email at any point, let's be honest). 

From this moment forward, I could barely hold a conversation with him. I told him I was sorry several times, even exaggerating how sorry I was because if it is to mantain good relationship I am fine with a white lie. 

But apparently this isn't enough. Any fucking time we even share a space there is a chill in the room. I wouldn't watch that way someone that punched me, but apparently me being late with sending a file (but not beyond the deadline!) was a mortal offense to him.
I did my best to remain friendly and all, but there is a limit.

My real issue? He doesn't fucking work with my PI or in my same lab anyway, yet he is hanging around my spaces all the time. 
Our PIs essentially work together, but they rarely actually share labs and working spaces. Thus, I still have this guy around way more often than I would like to. Meals, coffee breaks, him doing jackshit but hanging around our spaces chatting with others, occasionally using our lab. 
I don't work with this guy and he is still around me all the time. 

I honestly don't know how I am supposed to handle it.
It's absurd to make it a big deal as we don't ""work together"", but I still have to see him everyday and tank his middle school level grudge. And it's wearing me down. 
I don't want to snap at him someday, but it's gonna happen. I already did all the ""adult things"" possible, but apparently that's not the level he wants to act on.n

To be clear, it's not like I want him to get friendly or anything. I couldn't care less at this point. 
But if I have to have you come into my (shared with someone else) office room and use the coffee machine the least you could do is not being annoying to me sitting at my desk doing my work. 
Or to *politely* ask if I need the fume hood cabinet before coming in and use it. Me not being there now doesn't mean I won't need it, and the polite thing is to ask when you enter a space you are effectively ""only an occasional guest"". 
Similarly, any social situation we have to share gets weird quickly.

Medicine is working well. Last week I got lots done, I have been able to plan small things and stay focused. This week it's just not working. I have had errands Monday and Tuesday mornings, it takes hours because of transport, and it's hard for me to focus after because socially tired. So today, nothing works. Have just planned to be home and work. Nope. I'm not worried, but my body is not cooperating. I'm fidgeting, biting my cheek, cracking fingers, I can't focus.

Started listening to a podcast and doing something else for a while, because sometimes switching medium works for me, but fell like my thoughts are racing. I want to order bulbs for the garden, sew, play piano, shop online, plan a holiday. I made a matcha and oat milk (because more coffee is not happening today) but seriously, what do you do when this happens? When you have an unproductive day? Because then I feel like this week is not even worth trying to get anything done - my plan is shot anyway.

Right now I am really righting with myself not to start sorting laundry, organise a wardrobe or something like that, that I do because it's comfortable to my brain - but I don't have time. I need to focus on what's important.

For context, im a 33yo woman, im colombian but living in the UK currently.   
I'm in the 1 mg dosing and stepping up today to 1.7 mg. 

Everything is going well, Im down 20 lb and overall, im feeling ok... but im SO TIRED, always. 

I'm usually very active, I have been working out for more than 10 years at 6 am (when I was in uni I worked out at 4 am)... I used to need 6h of sleep and never napping during the day... Since stepping into the 1 mg dose, Im so so tired, I need to sleep more than 8 hours and I need 1 or 2 naps (30 mins) during the day. 

Im eating breakfast (oatmeal, fruits and almond milk) and lunch (usually 160-200g of animal protein, 100g of rice/quinoa/or any complex carbohydrate) and vegetables... and a late snack (around 5-6 pm) usually whey protein with yogurt and fruits or just with almond milk. 

Since last week, I started eating sweets as I thought it might be hypoglicemia (Im eating bananas and sometimes kit kats haha) which has helped me a bit, but still the fatigue is going. 

Im usually also having coffee (as im colombian, my average is having 4 cups of coffee per day, and that has been unchanged).

1fzncqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fzncqt/constain_pain_belching_nausea_after_upper_gi/,Constain pain / belching / nausea after upper GI endoscopy,"Hi!

It's amazing that you have a subreddit like this, and that actual health care professionals take their time to help people like this. So I just wanted to say thanks for that, and sorry for being a bit of a leech ‚Äì just barging in here with questions without ever having contributed. 

But I'm in a really rough spot right now, mentally, and would really appreciate any input. 

I'm a 34 year old male who went for an upper GI endoscopy in January in relation to getting diagnostisized for Crohns. 

I'm 5'9, currently weigh 80 kg / 176 pounds. I was in very good physical condition before the endoscopy, regularly exercising, lifting weights, swimming and climbing. 

I had however been struggling with pain in my abodmen and somewhat increased rate of belching for about two years - along with a more frequent need to go to the toilet. 

  
At the time when I got the Upper GI endoscopy, I had already underwent colonoscopy, which had shown that I had an infection in my ileum. This was back in September of 2023. But the hospital's specialist was reluctant to diagnose me with Crohns based on the one colonoscopy, which scared me, because my dad was diagnosed with stomach cancer in his 40s. So I requested my family doctor to refer me to an upper GI endoscopy. 

They told me it was virtually risk free, and I just wanted to get everything checked out, right?

  
The biggest mistake of my life, unfortunately. 

  
In the following days I started noticing a weird pain that is mostly in the upper left portion of my back, where it is at its sharpest ‚Äì but which frequently ""travels"" centrally, feeling as though it is along my spine (or esophagus) and in my chest ‚Äì along with an instant and severe increase in frequency of belching. 

It also hurts when I do certain movements that activate the ""spot"" in my shoulder where the pain sits. Stuff such as leaning forward while sitting (as in the motion I do when I lean forward only with my chest so that it is inclined at an angle from my stomach)

I soon realized that I can't exercise anymore, either. I've tried climbing, for instance, and even though the pain in my shoulder is activated in a bad way when I do so, I can push through the pain. 

But in the days that follow the belching / nausea / pain becomes unbearable. 

In the time since the endoscopy, this problem has only gotten worse. I've had an x-ray of my lungs, a cat scan, a cat scan with contrast.  

I've been on 80mg Somac daily and I've tried Entocort 9 mg daily as well as enzyme supplements for digestions. 

Only the Somac helps with the pain ‚Äì without it my days become really unbearable. 

I can't drink carbonated beverages, coffee ‚Äì lots of different foods seem to trigger symptoms. I went to Macdonalds with my kids the other day, and gave in to temptation, unfortunately, and ordered a Bigmac meal ‚Äì but the resulting belching/nausea, which lasted for days, seriously made me consider putting an end to it all. 

But even eating regular food and healthy now has become a hellish nightmare ‚Äì I can't hardly eat anything without it resulting in awful and excruciating belching ‚Äì constantly. The pain in my shoulder seems to intensify whenever I burp a lot ‚Äì and it often radiates into my chest and the center of my back ‚Äì where I imagine my esophagus to be located.   
The doctors don't seem to believe that my problems are caused by the endoscopy ‚Äì which is really frustrating, because my problems started that same day ‚Äì from one day to the next I became practically invalid. 

I feel like my life is over. I'm a 34 year old male who used to be in relatively good health, there wasn't really anything I couldn't do. I mean, the problems I had in relation to the probable Crohns disease were negligible ‚Äì practically non-existant in comparison to what I'm going through now. 

 I have nothing left to live for except my kids. I would seriously just have committed suicide if it weren't for them ‚Äì Like for instance, I've read about how parent suicide leads to increased risk of suicide in their children. I wouldn't ever do something like that to them, but I've started researching ways to do it that won't necessarily reveal that the outcome was intended. 

But even that I won't put them through, obviously. I won't do it, but I just feel like I'm on the end of my rope. 

My doctor hasn't wanted to prescribe antibiotics yet, for some reason I can't fathom. It's been nine months. But I have an appointment with her tomorrow, and she has indicated that she'll give it to me finally. 

But how can antibiotics magically solve the problems I'm experiencing? I feel certain that the guy who performed the endoscopy somehow F-ed something up inside of my esophagus ‚Äì making my hernia bigger, somehow, or otherwise altering the anatomy of my esophagus in a way that causes stomach acid to flow freely into it. 

What on earth happened during that endoscopy? I've considered chronic pancreatitis (I have a strange pain when I press on the tip of my breastbone, ie near the top of my stomach), pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum ‚Äì or maybe an ulcer or some sort of infection as a result of the presence of the tube in my esophagus? 

  
A small perforation that for some reason has never healed? 

  
I'm sorry for the long post, and I guess it's really impossible to answer anyway ‚Äì but I just wanted to try here, since I've tried everything else. 

  
Sorry, and thanks so much to anyone who bothered reading!",1,1728465991.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

About a few months ago I had a walk In around 11:30pm. I greeted him like I should and he mentioned he was looking for a room with two beds. Gave him the price which was really low that night, I think somewhere around 129 for a double queen bed at the ""TrialLawn Hotel"" by Larriott.

When it came to discussing breakfast, I informed him it wasn't complimentary because its not a buffet. Its made to order, restaurant style. They pay the bistro essentially, and as soon as I said that he got upset because ""wow, nothing is free anymore huh?"" with all the attitude. We discussed it some more and before I finished finalizing the reservation, I asked him if he would like to check out any other larriott properties around us because I know they have free breakfast. I used to work for those two a few years ago and they're right next door to us.

He said nothing so I proceeded with check in. Mentioned our amenities like the market. He asked if that was free and I politely told him ""no its not, its items for you to buy for your convenience."" Queue more complaints that ""nothing is free anymore""..... Like no shit sherlock, the world has changed and things cost more money now or what used to be complimentary isnt now.

But he just kept bringing up how ""nothing is free anymore"" over and over again. This was a big red flag to me, I've had people complain about pricing but never keep repeating how ""nothing is free"" like this guy did. Gave him his keys and sent him. his wife, and 3 kids on their way. It was 11:45pm at this time.

I go into the back office and say to myself (no joke) ""with the amount of complaining he did about things 'not being free', wouldnt it be funny if he tried to scam us by saying 'i fell in my room'?""

WEEEEEeeeeeeeeell, I jinxed myself because that's exactly what he did. He calls down at around 20 minutes later after getting into his room. So around 12:05 and claimed his wife just fell and hit her head and leg because ""something in the carpet"" made her fall.  She may have a concussion.

I immediately ask If an ambulance needs to be called because head injuries are no joke. He told me no. So I grab my incident report and head up to the room to check it out. As he's opening his room door, the carpet in the room is being dragged with the door. He finally gets it open and goes ""see? that is what caused her to fall""

I'm immediately suspicious, because there was no way our staff missed something that bad. It look freshly pulled out too... like just recently. I note that to myself for later.

Of course I talk with them about it and he's standing around waiting for me to tell him ""the room is comp'd for the night"" which I didn't say. What I did say is ""Im so sorry about that! Yes, this should have been checked before hand. ARE YOU SURE YOU DONT NEED AN AMBULANCE?"" They both told me no again and that they would just go to sleep. (weird to do after stating that she may have a concussion but I cant force them to accept medical help if that's their choice)

Me: again im sorry about that, at this point its going to be up to the managers to take whatever action they may need to take.

I stressed this question of needing an ambulance for a reason in which I'll get to. So I went to go grab some ice from the machine for her head and offered them headache/pain pills from our market at no cost. The husband will just have to come get them as I dont know what medicine is best for them. Some people can be allergic ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, take their info and leave. He never came down for those pills either.

Btw, I checked out her injury and I saw nothing. No red mark, scratches or swelling. And she was on her cell phone chatting it up with a friend of hers.... after just hitting her head and being in SO much pain. I go back to the desk and note everything and when management got in in the morning, informed them of what I thought about how the carpet looks to be done by them.

Cut to about a week later, management informs me that they need a statement from me because those two have been trying to just have the hotels insurance give them money. Not to pay for the doctor bill (they never went) they just wanted the hotels insurance to pay them out. They also stated that I never offered medical help. Which I did.

I type up my statement and send it to home office like I was asked and come to find out. They did indeed try to scam the hotel. See the carpet being pulled up wasnt by us as we checked with all staff and maintenance to see if they ""forgot"" to put the carpet back together. Housekeeping said the carpet wasnt like that as they could easily open the door without it dragging the carpet back nor did it ""catch"" on the door. It was firmly in place as it should. Maintenance never had to go in that room that day for any reason as there was no problems with it.

Add them lying about me not offering the ambulance and they figured out ""they just want an insurance pay out"" So they get nothing. They also happened to smoke in the room and left their cigarette butts as ""evidence"" of that in the coffee maker. Claiming ""it was already like that when we checked in"" but when I went up to the room to fill out the incident report and get names, the room smelled nothing of cigarette smoke.

I don't get why people think they can scam like this. Sure it MAY work rarely, but you're going to meet the right business that actually checks on things like this and it will be found out. So you and your family get nothing, hes now ""free"" to choose another hotel to scam because he's banned from here AND our home office gave them nothing on their end either as ""they declined medical help"". Twice.

Oh right and they had to pay more due to smoking in the rooms too. ü§£",10,1728465622.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,1,1.0,False

I've had my K-Ultra for a couple of years now and am very happy with it. One thing I've noticed is that when I dial in espresso I often find myself around the 2.0 range rather than the more commonly suggested 3.0. This morning (which sparked this post) I had to grind at 1.6 which was still too coarse... For context I have a cafelat robot and use 18g doses with the aim of 2:1 over 25-35s. 

Do you think this is a consequence of the set-up and individual coffees rather than the K-Ultra or does it sound like it needs calibrating? (Regarding calibration I can't move the dial further back than 0 so I think it's calibrated?)

Whether you‚Äôre sipping coffee on the porch or hosting a BBQ on the deck, both add value and style to your home! But do you know what sets them apart? ü§î 


Here are the key differences between a porch and a deck:
	1.	**Location**:
	‚Ä¢	A **porch** is typically attached to the front of the house, serving as a covered entrance or sitting area.
	‚Ä¢	A **deck** is usually located at the back of the house, designed for outdoor entertainment or relaxation.
	2.	**Roofing**:
	‚Ä¢	**Porches** are almost always covered with a roof, providing shelter from weather elements.
	‚Ä¢	**Decks** are often open-air, although some may have a pergola or partial covering.
	3.	**Purpose**:
	‚Ä¢	A **porch** is often seen as a transitional space between the outdoors and indoors, offering a place to greet guests or relax in a cozy, shaded area.
	‚Ä¢	A **deck** is used primarily for outdoor activities like BBQs, sunbathing, or social gatherings.
	4.	**Material**:
	‚Ä¢	**Porches** are commonly made with concrete or wood and are usually enclosed with railings or walls.
	‚Ä¢	**Decks** are often made from wood or composite materials and are usually elevated off the ground with open views.
	5.	**Design**:
	‚Ä¢	**Porches** tend to have a more formal look, complementing the architectural style of the house.
	‚Ä¢	**Decks** are more flexible in design and can be customized with different levels, built-in seating, or outdoor kitchens.

I started TRT (testosterone replacement therapy) 8 weeks ago. I‚Äôm currently taking 150mg of testosterone enanthate per week, administered through microdoses every other day (EOD) via intramuscular injections.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed so far:

	‚Ä¢	Energy & Muscle Growth: I feel more energetic and have been gaining noticeable muscle, which I‚Äôm really happy with.

	‚Ä¢	Sleep Issues: However, my sleep has been terrible. I usually sleep for about 4-5 hours, then wake up wide awake. It takes me ages to fall back asleep. While I wake up feeling somewhat alert, the lack of good-quality sleep is really wearing me down.

	‚Ä¢	Snoring & Sweating: I‚Äôve also started snoring heavily, which never used to be an issue, and I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm sweating excessively‚Äîmore than usual, sometimes to an uncomfortable degree.

What I‚Äôve already tried for better sleep:

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm taking Ashwagandha and Magnesium Bisglycinate to help with sleep.
	‚Ä¢	I avoid coffee, green tea, and heavy workouts late at night.

I train 4-6 times per week and would consider myself to have an athletic build.

Lab Results After 8 Weeks:

	‚Ä¢	Free Testosterone: 1104 pmol/L
	‚Ä¢	Total Testosterone: 35.2 nmol/L     
	‚Ä¢	Estradiol: 323 pmol/L (88.2 pg/mL)

1fzmyn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/trt/comments/1fzmyn6/9_weeks_on_trt/,9 Weeks on TrT ,"Hey everyone,

I started TRT (testosterone replacement therapy) 9 weeks ago. I‚Äôm currently taking 150mg of testosterone enanthate per week, administered through microdoses every other day (EOD) via intramuscular injections.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed so far:

	‚Ä¢	Energy & Muscle Growth: I feel more energetic and have been gaining noticeable muscle, which I‚Äôm really happy with.

	‚Ä¢	Sleep Issues: However, my sleep has been terrible. I usually sleep for about 4-5 hours, then wake up wide awake. It takes me ages to fall back asleep. While I wake up feeling somewhat alert, the lack of good-quality sleep is really wearing me down.

	‚Ä¢	Snoring & Sweating: I‚Äôve also started snoring heavily, which never used to be an issue, and I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm sweating excessively‚Äîmore than usual, sometimes to an uncomfortable degree.

What I‚Äôve already tried for better sleep:

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm taking Ashwagandha and Magnesium Bisglycinate to help with sleep.
	‚Ä¢	I avoid coffee, green tea, and heavy workouts late at night.

I train 4-6 times per week and would consider myself to have an athletic build.

Lab Results After 8 Weeks:

	‚Ä¢	Free Testosterone: 1104 pmol/L
	‚Ä¢	Total Testosterone: 35.2 nmol/L    
	‚Ä¢	Estradiol: 323 pmol/L (88.2 pg/mL)
	‚Ä¢	SHBG 17.8 nmol/L

What do you guys think of these results and my symptoms? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",2,1728464119.0,trt,4,1.0,False

After six months of preparation, I finally took the plunge and quit my job to start my home business. While I appreciated the financial stability my previous job offered, it often felt suffocating and left me drained. I frequently found myself daydreaming about my passions, but the daily grind made it hard to pursue them. Plus, I wanted to spend more time with my kids, which was a major factor in my decision to work from home.
I spent a month building my website on Shoplazza, selling products shipped directly from China. At first, the freedom was exhilarating, and I thought I could structure my day however I pleased. But a few weeks in, I found myself constantly sidetracked by family duties and my child&#039;s demands. Daily interruptions became the norm: my kid needing help, chores piling up, and even zoning out while enjoying a cup of coffee. It made me question‚Äîhad I become lazy?
This chaotic situation left me feeling anxious and uncertain about my choice. Could I really manage my time freely while running a home business? I‚Äôve always prided myself on being self-motivated, but perhaps it was the rigid schedule of my old job that kept me productive. To test this theory, I decided to set specific working hours, like 9 AM to 3 PM each day. During that block, I turned off my phone notifications and focused entirely on processing orders and updating my site.
The results were eye-opening; my efficiency shot up, and I finally tackled tasks I had been putting off. While balancing work and family is still a work in progress, I discovered that having a structured schedule made my workflow much smoother.
Now I‚Äôm left wondering: is it really necessary to have strict working hours like a regular job when starting a home business? I chose this path for the flexibility, but maybe a little structure goes a long way.",6,1728463816.0,workfromhome,5,1.0,False

How do you deal with an abusive boss? Like this guy hurls insults from morning to evening, whether he's around or not. Atapiga simu kukugombanisha, and 99.99% of the time, you have no idea what you did wrong. Then after he's done, that's when he asks. Then finishes with a ""hunanga akili"".

Utaitwa Malaya, mapoka, takataka, mshenzi, jangili etc. And he's very loud about it. And there's a way he'll phrase it to sort of make it more insulting.

It's a different area from my career path but when you ask him a question or you need a clarification, you start regretting why you did it. The first time I asked, I was met with, ""kumbe unakuwanga mjinga hivi"", followed by a sarcastic laugh. The thing is it's not a difficult job, kitu you can learn easily as you work, but he'll make you doubt yourself hadi ujishangae.

You tell yourself those words mean nothing, but unapata tu they're affecting you. You become so unproductive and tense throughout the day. Our office phone has a certain ringing tone, and every time nikiiskia, I start panicking. I hear that tone even in my sleep.

Yesterday, I just realized I haven't had anything that's not cake and coffee for like 3 days. Food doesn't taste the same anymore. You get home you just want to sleep. I also realized I've been sitting and walking in a defensive posture, like sort of hunching my shoulders, and I can feel how tense they are.

And oh, he beats the guys here as well. Either ngoto or using a cane, kama Ile ya primary school. Also heard sometimes he'll pull a gun on you akiona you're not scared of him like he wants you to be.

1fzmu1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1fzmu1a/my_mom_died_today_and_i_feel_weird/,My Mom died today and I feel weird,"My Nmom died today of complications during surgery. I don't know how to feel about it. I stopped talking to her a couple years back after realizing I would never get what I needed from her. I never have, and a couple years back I realized I never would.

  


My Nmom was a narcissist. Undiagnosed of course. Why would she ever see anyone and get diagnosed? Nothing was ever her fault; she was perfect. In my 37 years of life, I have never heard her give a sincere apology. I have gotten very sarcastic ‚Äúoh, I'm sorry I'm such a terrible mother.‚Äù But never any admission of any faults, failures, or mistakes on her part. If anyone did point out anything she did wrong, she was quick to change the subject to one where she was right, and smugly tell them how they are actually in the wrong in this unrelated situation. ‚ÄúOh, my emotional neglect caused you irreparable harm? Well your feet are on the coffee table, and that's clearly the most egregious offense so that's what we are going to talk about and I refuse to even entertain whatever trivial issues you were talking about.‚Äù

  


I think her favorite thing was being right. It certainly wasn't me or her other children. When she was right, she would never let it go. She would use it like a blunt object to condescendingly tell you over and over how she was in the right and you were in the wrong. I think my dad learned to tune her out pretty early on, probably before I was born. When she would verbally attack him, he would go quiet and not engage. Disassociation, I think they call it. I learned to do the same. After all, she was like a force of nature. You'd no sooner stop an avalanche than have her ease up when she was berating you. And once she beat you over the head with her rightness, that wasn‚Äôt the end of it. It could and would be brought up in the future if she ever wanted to berate or punish you, or just deflect an argument away from one that might show her in an unfavorable light.

  


I don't think she liked me. The only time I got any sort of positive attention was if I was excelling academically or athletically. I think she just wanted to be able to brag about how well I was doing at something. At home, anything less than perfection was punishable. She had an attitude when I was unhappy like ‚Äúoh you think you‚Äôre upset? I'll give you something to be upset about.‚Äù I learned to hide and suppress any negative emotions, whether or not she was the source, as she would never offer comfort or support. She would just get mad that I was sad/angry/upset and punish me. It did turn into me suppressing all emotions, and feeling some amount of shame around them, good or bad. 

  


She never took an interest in things I liked, whether games, tv, books, or friends. She did recognize what I liked, but just so she could take them away as a punishment. We never shared any activities when I was a kid. At best, when we were very young, she would let me and my brother silently watch her play video games, but would kick us out if we talked at all. We weren‚Äôt allowed to play, just quietly observe. She did help with homework, as my dad pointed out when I mentioned this to him, but that doesn‚Äôt really count in my mind. It was not a ‚Äúfun‚Äù activity that we shared. It was like, as kids, we were expected to neatly slot into her life without her ever having to make any sort of effort. 

  


I felt like I had to walk on eggshells at home. I had to be constantly mindful of her moods, because if she was in a bad mood she would take it out on us. Out of sight, out of mind was my only reprieve. I would hide in my bedroom to hopefully not be noticed. I was one of those children that was praised for being mature for my age. I think it was just me not being able to relax and be a kid, instead I had to be ever-vigilant for whatever might set her off.

  


I never confronted her with these grievances. A few years ago she invited me to dinner and I told her that if she were to talk down to me or my dad when I visited then I would have to leave because I couldn‚Äôt be in that situation anymore. That visit she did it again during supper, berating my dad for something trivial. Putting dirty dishes in the clean dishwasher or something. However my niece was also there for dinner, and I was giving her a ride home but didn‚Äôt want to take her away in the middle of dinner. So I told my Nmom to stop it, she‚Äôs doing it again, and she just looked startled, either like she had never been called out on it before or didn‚Äôt realize she was berating him at all.

  


Some time after that incident, she was diagnosed with cancer. That got me thinking that if she died, I would never get any closure, any sort of apology for all the harm she did to me. And then I realized that if she survived, I wouldn‚Äôt get it either. I had never seen her apologize and acknowledge any wrongdoing before, why would I expect her to now? If I ever brought up the laundry list of issues I had with her, I would expect one of three responses: she would either immediately change the subject to some trivial bullshit where I was wrong (‚Äúlet‚Äôs not talk about how I damaged you emotionally your whole life, because remember that time in high school when you had a beer?‚Äù), she would say how it was all my fault because of what a lousy child I was or something, or she would get upset and go sulk and act like the true crime was that I said hurtful things that made her feel bad. Based on being around her for over thirty years, I would estimate that there was less than a 1% chance she would hear what I had to say, reflect on it, make any kind of apology, and make any meaningful change. It was far more likely that she would lash out and try to hurt me, and if I wasn‚Äôt around, my dad.

  


I realized that talking to her and being around her made me feel small, helpless, tired, and guilty. Guilty of what? That, I still don‚Äôt know. I guess just existing and having needs and emotions that she wasn‚Äôt equipped to deal with. I didn‚Äôt want to feel that way anymore so I just withdrew from the situation, and stopped talking to her. Maybe not the nicest thing to do to someone undergoing cancer treatments, but it‚Äôs not like she was ever there for me when I needed her. I had had enough of being her punching bag that would always spring back, ready for another blow.

  


Even after moving across the country from her, I felt like her shadow was looming over me. Maybe now that she's gone I can finally move one. What I really wanted from her all along was a better childhood.",16,1728463526.0,raisedbynarcissists,11,1.0,False

CIO called to request for a final interview one day after my presentation because he wants to understand my goal of leaving. Had a good coffee chat and he even mentioned that I can speak to the HR regarding the bonus I will potentially miss for leaving the job. I had a good feeling at this point since the coffee chat went really well, plus I do think I can read social cues appropriately to know that things are going in the right direction. 

Immediately the next day, I got a text message from the headhunter saying ‚Äúgood news, they are keen to offer you the role‚Äù - mind you, this is word for word. We then proceed to discuss pay, benefits, notice period and potentially buying out my notice period. 

I was on a long holiday at that point in time and only returned 3 weeks later. Then bam, when I‚Äôm back, I was told that they have offered the role to a later candidate who joined the process after me. 

When I asked my headhunter why did she say it was an offer when clearly it isn‚Äôt. The reason why I said that is because I doubt a verbal offer was given but got rescinded. She then proceed to tell me she didn‚Äôt say it was an offer right from the beginning lol.

1fzmp3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1fzmp3u/i_hate_doctors_part_99999/,I hate doctors part 99999,"TL;DR My GP diagnosed me with anxiety and depression based on little to no evidence, and I‚Äôm worried it means other doctors won‚Äôt take me seriously. Depression is serious and should be diagnosed with more care.

I recently received a letter from one of my doctors, and for the first time, I saw what my GP had written as my diagnosis and I‚Äôm furious.

If my GP is telling all the doctors that I have anxiety and depression, how can I expect them to take me/cfs seriously? The diagnosis seems to be based solely on the fact that I expressed fear and even cried during some of our appointments. Hardly a scientific assessment. ü§¨

I live in one of the most advanced countries in the world, and I‚Äôve consulted numerous doctors, many of whom are leaders in their fields. Yet, they look me in the eye and admit they don‚Äôt know how to help me. Should I feel joyful for this? I‚Äôm not denying that this illness comes with a lot of emotional distress, but depression is a serious, specific condition and should be treated with the gravity it deserves. Diagnosing it so freely diminishes its significance. Am I wrong?

I‚Äôve seen here a lot of people struggling, and I‚Äôm not suggesting that some don‚Äôt have depression, but I‚Äôve also seen many individuals simply yearning for small joys in life, like having coffee with a friend. From what I understand, someone with depression can still physically go out for a coffee, but the problem is they don't want to. I think none of us will really end up having depression anyway if we would be treated correctly. End rant!

    My general goal is to be able to play recent video games (not just MHWilds) at 1440p with a guarantee of at least 120 constant fps.
    
    I built my PC on my own but I don't know much about component compatibility, that's why I'm turning to you. I would like to be able to only change the screen and graphics card but I don't know if this is viable given the objectives mentioned above.
    
    My budget would be ‚Ç¨1000 if there is only a screen and a GPU to change.
    
    As for the screens, I looked at what was going on and this one looks pretty good to me, it meets a certain number of my criteria (notably in terms of connectivity with at least one display port, one HDMI and one jack): TUF Gaming VG27AQ HDR - 27 inchesASUS.
    
    I had also seen this one but the stand doesn't suit me and would take up too much space on my desk: AOC Gaming Q27G3XMN - 27-inch QHD monitor.
    
    For graphics cards I also looked a little but I am not able to identify the best choice for my current configuration but I saw interesting things in the 600‚Ç¨-700‚Ç¨ range.
    
    One last question, should I wait before buying knowing that a new generation of GPUs may be announced/released early next year and that this could lead to a drop in the cost of previous generations?

Australia is in the grip of yet another sordid true crime saga in the form of the infamous (alleged) ‚Äúmushroom murders‚Äù in a case that involves possible poisoned beef wellingtons, a Sunday lunch turned deadly and a trail of perhaps attempted murders stretching back to 2021.

The case centers on 49-year-old Erin Patterson who, on July 29 last year, hosted a luncheon with the family of her ex-husband Simon Patterson, including his parents and his aunt and uncle.

At the luncheon in the town of Leongatha, Patterson, whose husband was not in attendance, served what has now become an infamous dish ‚Äì a beef wellington which included a slab of beef, latticed pastry, and a mushroom duxelles, a traditional mix of minced mushrooms, herbs, and onions.

Following the meal, Simon Patterson‚Äôs mother, father, aunt, and uncle complained of gastroenteritis-like symptoms and went to hospital the next day. In the coming days, his father, mother and aunt died, while his uncle made a slow recovery after falling into a coma.

In an explosive development following an already tragic story, Erin Patterson was arrested and has now been charged with three counts of murder and five of attempted murder, including four counts of attempted murder of her husband in the years prior to and including the fatal lunch.

Police allege that Erin Patterson spiked the beef wellington with death cap mushrooms, a single bite of which can prove fatal.

The case has transfixed people the world over since Erin Patterson was arrested in November last year, and interest has renewed following her appearance in court in Australia on Monday.

In many ways, the case is similar to that of Indonesian Jessica Kumala Wongso, who was jailed for 20 years by a Jakarta court in 2016 after being found guilty of the murder of her friend, Wayan Mirna Salihin.

Salihin died on January 6, 2016 after drinking a Vietnamese iced coffee, ordered by Wongso, at the upscale Olivier Cafe in the swanky Grand Indonesia Mall. The police said that Wongso was jealous of her friend, who had recently married, and had spiked the coffee with cyanide.

The Salihin-Wongso case captivated Indonesia for months as the trial, which was televised, dragged on, sparking a barrage of commentary similar to Erin Patterson‚Äôs case, and prompting the question: why do we find (alleged) female murderers so fascinating?

Perhaps part of the answer is that, statistically, female murderers are far rarer than men.

According to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Global Study on Homicide 2023, some 90 percent of suspects brought into contact with police for intentional homicides in 2021 were men, meaning that for every 10 murders globally, nine were committed by men and only one by a woman.

Men are also more likely to be victims of homicide, the report said, accounting for 81 percent of victims of intentional homicide globally in 2021. The way in which men are likely to murder is also different, with young men aged between 15 and 29 most at risk and often the result of a vortex of violence. Men are more likely to die, for example, as the result of an escalating fight during which one or both draw a knife or a gun, or beat each other with bare fists.

How women murder however is quite different.

According to an article in the Washington Post, using data taken from the Federal Bureau of Investigation Supplemental Homicide Report, ‚ÄúWomen use guns way less than half the time, although it still remains the most popular weapon among women. After guns, women are likely to use a knife, to beat their victim to death or to strike them with a blunt object. After guns, poison is the sixth most common way for a woman to kill.‚Äù

While poison is a less frequently used method of killing for both men and women, it stands out statistically.

‚ÄúWith all guns removed, women are almost four times as likely as men to use poison. It is used in just over 1 percent of killings by men, and just over four percent of killings by women. In the final analysis, men kill with poison more often. But it is the weapon of choice by women murderers much more than men, even if the male predilection for guns is removed,‚Äù the Washington Post article continues.

‚ÄúYes, poison is a women‚Äôs weapon.‚Äù

That women choose poison more than men does not mean that either Wongso or Patterson are definitively guilty of the crimes of which they were accused (although Wongso was convicted in a court of law), but perhaps the data shows why we are so mesmerized by cases such as these.

Knowing that women have a predilection for poison ‚Äì which makes sense when the use of physical force is often stacked in a man‚Äôs favor ‚Äì any case in which a woman appears to have played the part of a merry murderess cooking up poisoned potions, be they cyanide-laden coffee or death cap beef wellingtons, is likely to capture the collective imagination.

With Patterson‚Äôs trial only just beginning, we shall have to wait and see if she will add to the statistics.",0,1728461687.0,WomenAreViolentToo,0,0.5,False

I met her November last year through some dating app, we shared a lot of common interests. We clicked fairly well however I could see the red flags coming up. 

Last year was not a good year for me in fact it was horrible, i lost my younger and only brother to a sudden illness, I broke up with my ex, I quit my full time job cause it was a very very toxic work environment. However I was fairly confident I would succeed as my business was doing okay and i had a house and car. However turn into the New Year the business took a massive hit when one of our biggest clients pulled out. So I had to sell my house and car. 

All this while I was with my GF when life was good I treated her well,and she has been very supportive of me. So comes February I don't have my own house and no car, i decided to rent a house and my mother(62F) asks to come and stay with me which i instantly agree cause Im her only child, and my dad and brother being gone I reckon it would be great to keep the family together and plus she help immensely with bills and chores. 

Now the dilemma is my gf is an awesome supporter of me she has this extremely positive outlook that I will bounce back and she is supportive as hell in terms of helping financially. However she refuses to do anything around the house, I cook and clean the only thing she was suppose to take care was laundry but she refuses to do for months and if she does she only does hers. Im getting annoyed because its a team effort yet she is oblivious. She and my mother get along but only 70% which is a positive I guess, but she acts like a princess, she comes home from work and i cook and i serve her, then she just sleeps off, I work through out the night on my side projects and make for her, her morning coffee and send her off to work. 

I'm trying very hard not to blow my top I guess my biggest qualm is the fact that she acts like money solves everything if im annoyed and tell her i'm not cooking till she does the laundry she just orders uber eats and only for herself. I don't want to rock the boat but im totally annoyed at the behavior and told her countless times yet she just laughs, and when i get mad she get emotional and quiet.
