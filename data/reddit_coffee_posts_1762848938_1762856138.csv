1ou5sr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1ou5sr7/best_vpns_for_pbs/,Best VPNs for PBS,"PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) delivers some of the most acclaimed educational programming, documentaries, and drama series available—from *Masterpiece* classics to *NOVA* science explorations and *Frontline* investigative journalism. But there's a catch: PBS content is geo-restricted to viewers in the United States and Canada only.

If you're traveling abroad, living as an expat, or simply want to access your local PBS station's livestream from outside your coverage area, you'll need a reliable VPN to bypass these restrictions. However, not all VPNs work with PBS—the service actively detects and blocks many VPN IP addresses.

After extensive testing of major VPN providers with PBS streaming in 2025, we've identified the services that consistently bypass PBS's geo-blocks while delivering the speed and reliability you need for buffer-free HD streaming.

# Quick Summary: Best VPNs for PBS

* **NordVPN** \- Best overall for PBS with 8,400+ servers, lightning-fast NordLynx protocol, and Threat Protection Pro ad-blocking ($2.99/month)
* **Surfshark** \- Best budget option with unlimited device connections, 800+ Mbps speeds, and CleanWeb ad blocker ($1.99/month)
* **ExpressVPN** \- Premium choice with MediaStreamer for devices without VPN support and optimized Lightway protocol ($8.32/month)
* **Private Internet Access** \- Massive 35,000+ server network ensures you always find a working US server ($2.03/month)
* **CyberGhost** \- Beginner-friendly with dedicated streaming servers and 45-day money-back guarantee ($2.11/month)

# Why You Need a VPN for PBS

PBS restricts its streaming content to viewers physically located in the United States and Canada due to licensing agreements. When you try to access [PBS.org](http://PBS.org) or the PBS app from outside these regions, you'll encounter an error message stating the content is unavailable in your area.

A VPN solves this problem by routing your internet connection through a server located in the US or Canada, giving you an IP address from that region. PBS's systems detect this US/Canadian IP address and grant you access to the full streaming library.

# PBS's Stance on VPN Usage

According to PBS's official help documentation, the service ""does not support the use of VPNs to bypass geo-restrictions."" PBS states they need to verify your location for both local livestreams (which can only be streamed in that station's coverage area) and on-demand content (typically limited to US and Canada).

PBS detects VPN usage primarily by identifying large numbers of users connecting from the same IP address with similar traffic patterns—a telltale sign of a VPN server. When detected, PBS blocks that IP address, preventing access until the VPN provider rotates to a new IP.

This is why choosing a premium VPN matters: low-quality free VPNs lack the resources to continuously replace blocked IPs, leaving you unable to stream PBS. Premium providers, on the other hand, maintain vast server networks and quickly rotate IPs to stay ahead of detection systems.

# The Best VPNs for PBS: Detailed Reviews

# 1. NordVPN - Best Overall for PBS Streaming

**Pricing:** $2.99-$3.39/month (2-year plan), $4.99-$7.99/month (1-year), $12.99-$15.99/month (monthly)

NordVPN consistently ranks as the top choice for PBS streaming thanks to its massive server network, exceptional speeds, and advanced security features. With over 8,400 servers spanning 129 countries—including hundreds of optimized US servers across multiple cities—you'll always find a fast, reliable connection for PBS.

**Why NordVPN Excels for PBS:**

* **NordLynx Protocol**: NordVPN's proprietary protocol delivers speeds up to 72% of your base connection in testing, making it one of the fastest VPNs available. This translates to buffer-free HD and even 4K streaming.
* **Threat Protection Pro**: Built-in ad and malware blocking enhances your streaming experience by removing intrusive ads and protecting against malicious websites.
* **Specialty Servers**: Beyond standard US servers, NordVPN offers P2P-optimized servers, Double VPN for extra encryption, and obfuscated servers that hide the fact you're using a VPN—useful if your ISP throttles VPN traffic.
* **10 Simultaneous Connections**: Protect your phone, laptop, tablet, smart TV, and more under a single subscription.

**Audit Trail**: NordVPN has undergone multiple independent audits by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Deloitte, most recently in December 2024, confirming its strict no-logs policy. This means NordVPN doesn't track or store your browsing history, streaming activity, or connection timestamps.

In our testing with PBS, NordVPN consistently bypassed geo-restrictions on both the PBS website and mobile apps. Livestreams loaded within seconds, and on-demand content played in full 1080p quality without buffering, even when connected to servers on the opposite coast.

**Best For:** Users who want the fastest speeds, most reliable PBS access, and premium security features at a reasonable price.

# 2. Surfshark - Best Budget VPN for PBS

**Pricing:** $1.99-$2.29/month (2-year plan), $3.19/month (1-year), $15.49/month (monthly)

Surfshark proves that exceptional VPN performance doesn't require a premium price tag. At just $1.99 per month for its two-year plan, Surfshark delivers speeds exceeding 800 Mbps in US server tests—outpacing both NordVPN and ExpressVPN in raw performance.

**Why Surfshark Stands Out:**

* **Unlimited Device Connections**: Unlike competitors that cap simultaneous connections at 8-10 devices, Surfshark allows unlimited connections. Perfect for families, households with many smart devices, or users who want to share a subscription.
* **CleanWeb Ad Blocker**: Blocks ads, trackers, and malware across your browsing and streaming, creating a cleaner PBS viewing experience.
* **MultiHop Double Encryption**: Routes your traffic through two VPN servers for extra privacy—overkill for most PBS streaming but valuable for privacy-conscious users.
* **3,200+ Global Servers**: While smaller than NordVPN's network, Surfshark's server fleet spans 100+ countries with robust US coverage.

**Recent Audit**: In June 2025, Deloitte conducted its second independent audit of Surfshark's no-logs policy, verifying that the company upholds its privacy commitments across standard, static, and multi-hop servers.

During testing, Surfshark delivered average speeds of 61% of our base connection, which is more than sufficient for HD streaming on PBS. We experienced zero buffering during multi-hour streaming sessions of *Masterpiece* and *NOVA* episodes. The service successfully accessed PBS content from servers in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas.

**Best For:** Budget-conscious users, families needing multiple simultaneous connections, and anyone seeking excellent value without compromising performance.

# 3. ExpressVPN - Premium Choice with MediaStreamer

**Pricing:** $8.32/month (12-month plan), $12.95/month (monthly)

ExpressVPN commands a premium price, but it delivers features that justify the cost—particularly for users who want to stream PBS on devices that don't natively support VPN apps.

**What Makes ExpressVPN Worth the Price:**

* **MediaStreamer DNS**: This innovative feature allows you to configure PBS streaming on smart TVs, gaming consoles (PlayStation, Xbox), Apple TV, and other devices that can't install VPN software. Simply change your device's DNS settings to ExpressVPN's MediaStreamer addresses, and you can access geo-restricted PBS content without running VPN software.
* **Lightway Protocol**: ExpressVPN's proprietary protocol is designed for speed and efficiency, using 1,000x less code than OpenVPN while maintaining military-grade security. In our tests, it delivered speeds approaching 89% of our base connection.
* **8 Device Connections**: While not unlimited like Surfshark, 8 simultaneous connections accommodate most households.
* **3,000+ Servers in 94 Countries**: ExpressVPN maintains servers in multiple US cities for reliable PBS access.

**Security Credentials**: ExpressVPN passed a detailed PwC audit of its TrustedServer technology, which runs all servers on RAM only—meaning all data is automatically wiped with every reboot.

ExpressVPN excelled in our PBS testing, particularly for streaming on unconventional devices. We successfully configured MediaStreamer on a Roku Ultra, Samsung Smart TV, and PlayStation 5, accessing PBS content without installing any apps on the devices themselves. Standard VPN connections delivered consistent speeds above 89 Mbps on our 100 Mbps connection.

**Best For:** Users who need PBS access on smart TVs and gaming consoles, and those willing to pay premium prices for premium features and reliability.

# 4. Private Internet Access (PIA) - Best Server Coverage

**Pricing:** $2.03/month (2-year plan)

Private Internet Access distinguishes itself with a staggering 35,000+ servers across 78 countries—by far the largest network among major VPN providers. This massive infrastructure virtually guarantees you'll always find a working US server, even as PBS blocks individual IPs.

**PIA's Advantages:**

* **Massive Server Network**: With hundreds of US servers distributed across numerous cities, PIA can quickly rotate to fresh IPs when PBS blocks a server.
* **Advanced Customization**: PIA offers granular control over encryption levels, protocols, and connection settings—appealing to technical users who want to optimize their setup.
* **WireGuard Protocol**: PIA supports the modern WireGuard protocol alongside OpenVPN and IKEv2, offering users flexibility based on their speed and security priorities.
* **Affordable Pricing**: At $2.03/month for the two-year plan, PIA delivers enterprise-level infrastructure at budget prices.

In testing, PIA successfully accessed PBS from servers in 10 different US cities. We appreciated the ability to quickly switch servers when one was running slowly or experiencing congestion. The massive server count means you're unlikely to encounter overcrowded servers during peak streaming hours.

**Best For:** Users who want maximum server options, technical users who appreciate customization, and those seeking reliable PBS access with minimal price.

# 5. CyberGhost - Best for Beginners

**Pricing:** $2.11/month (2-year plan), 45-day money-back guarantee

CyberGhost prioritizes user-friendliness without sacrificing performance, making it an excellent choice for VPN newcomers who want to stream PBS without technical complications.

**Why Beginners Love CyberGhost:**

* **Dedicated Streaming Servers**: CyberGhost labels servers specifically optimized for streaming services. Simply select ""For Streaming > PBS"" and the app automatically connects you to the best server.
* **One-Click Connection**: The app features a prominent ""Connect"" button that automatically selects the optimal server based on your location and streaming needs.
* **9,000+ Servers in 90 Countries**: CyberGhost's extensive network ensures strong US coverage for PBS access.
* **45-Day Money-Back Guarantee**: Unlike the industry-standard 30-day guarantee, CyberGhost offers 45 days to test the service risk-free—the longest refund window among major providers.

**Simple Setup**: CyberGhost's apps are intuitive even for first-time VPN users. During installation, the setup wizard walks you through connecting to a server and explains basic features in plain English.

Our testing confirmed that CyberGhost's dedicated streaming servers reliably accessed PBS content. We particularly appreciated the beginner-friendly interface, which presents complex VPN features in an accessible format without overwhelming new users.

**Best For:** VPN beginners, users who want dedicated streaming servers, and anyone who appreciates extended money-back guarantees for thorough testing.

# How to Watch PBS with a VPN: Step-by-Step

# Method 1: Using the PBS Website

1. **Subscribe to a VPN**: Choose one of our recommended providers (NordVPN for best overall, Surfshark for budget, ExpressVPN for MediaStreamer support).
2. **Download and Install**: Get the VPN app for your device (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux).
3. **Connect to a US Server**: Launch the VPN app and connect to a server located in the United States. For best results, choose a server in a major city like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, or Washington DC.
4. **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**: Before accessing PBS, clear your browser's cache and cookies to remove any location data PBS may have stored. This prevents the site from detecting your previous non-US location.
5. **Visit PBS.org**: Navigate to pbs.org. If the VPN is working correctly, you should now see the full PBS streaming library without geo-restriction errors.
6. **Create an Account (Optional)**: While much PBS content is free, creating a free PBS account lets you mark favorites and track viewing progress.
7. **Access PBS Passport (Optional)**: For extended content access, consider activating PBS Passport by donating $5/month or $60/year to your local PBS station.

# Method 2: Using the PBS Mobile App

1. **Connect VPN on Your Device**: Before opening the PBS app, connect to a US server through your VPN app.
2. **Turn Off Location Services**: In your device settings, disable location services for the PBS app. This prevents the app from detecting your true location via GPS.
3. **Clear PBS App Data**: On Android, go to Settings > Apps > PBS > Storage > Clear Data. On iOS, uninstall and reinstall the PBS app to clear cached location data.
4. **Launch the PBS App**: Open the app while connected to your VPN. It should now function as if you're in the United States.

# Method 3: Streaming on Smart TVs and Devices

**For VPN-Compatible Devices** (Amazon Fire TV, Android TV):

1. Install your VPN's app directly from the device's app store
2. Connect to a US server
3. Launch the PBS app

**For Non-Compatible Devices** (Roku, most smart TVs):

1. Use ExpressVPN's MediaStreamer by configuring your device's DNS settings
2. Alternatively, install your VPN on your home router to protect all connected devices
3. Some VPN providers offer Smart DNS services specifically for streaming devices

# Understanding PBS Content Access

# PBS Free Content vs. PBS Passport

**Free PBS Content** (No account needed):

* Recent episodes of PBS NewsHour
* Frontline investigative documentaries
* Independent Lens and POV films
* Select episodes from popular series (available for limited time after broadcast)
* Local PBS station livestreams

**PBS Passport** ($5/month or $60/year donation):

* Extended on-demand library with 1,000+ episodes
* Full seasons of Masterpiece dramas
* Complete NOVA and Nature series
* American Masters and American Experience documentaries
* Early access to new episodes before broadcast
* Longer viewing windows for popular programs

# Geographic Restrictions

PBS content has two layers of geo-restrictions:

1. **US/Canada Only**: Most PBS content is restricted to viewers in the United States and Canada due to international licensing agreements. A VPN lets you access this content from anywhere by connecting to a US or Canadian server.
2. **Local Station Coverage**: Each PBS station's livestream is restricted to viewers within that station's broadcast coverage area. Even with a VPN connected to a US server, you may only be able to watch the livestream of PBS stations near your VPN server's location.

**Pro Tip**: If you want to watch a specific PBS station's livestream, connect to a VPN server in that station's city. For example, to watch WGBH Boston's livestream, connect to a VPN server in Boston.

# Troubleshooting PBS VPN Issues

# ""This Video Is Not Available in Your Region""

**Solution**: Your current VPN server may be blocked by PBS. Try these steps:

1. **Switch to a different US server** in another city
2. **Clear your browser cache and cookies** completely
3. **Disable browser location services** in your browser settings
4. **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge)
5. **Restart your device** to clear any cached location data
6. **Contact your VPN's support** to ask which servers currently work best with PBS

# Slow Streaming or Constant Buffering

**Solution**: Connection speed issues typically stem from server congestion or distance:

1. **Connect to a geographically closer US server** (if you're in Europe, East Coast servers may be faster than West Coast)
2. **Switch to a less congested server** in the same city
3. **Change VPN protocols** (try WireGuard or NordLynx for better speeds)
4. **Lower video quality** in PBS player settings
5. **Close other bandwidth-heavy applications**
6. **Test your base internet speed** without the VPN to ensure your connection meets minimum requirements (25 Mbps for HD streaming)

# PBS App Detecting Real Location

**Solution**: Mobile apps can detect your true location via GPS:

1. **Disable location services** for the PBS app in your device settings
2. **Clear the PBS app's cached data** or reinstall the app
3. **Connect to VPN before opening the app**
4. **Use the PBS website instead** of the app (VPNs work more reliably with browsers)

# VPN Connection Drops During Streaming

**Solution**: Enable your VPN's kill switch feature:

1. Find **Kill Switch** (also called ""Network Lock"" or ""Network Protection"") in your VPN settings
2. Enable the feature—it automatically blocks internet traffic if your VPN disconnects
3. This prevents PBS from detecting your real location during momentary connection drops
4. If drops persist, try switching to a more stable VPN protocol like OpenVPN TCP

# VPN Features That Matter for PBS Streaming

# Fast Speeds

PBS streams in up to 1080p HD, requiring consistent speeds of at least 5 Mbps (8-10 Mbps recommended). All our recommended VPNs deliver speeds exceeding 50 Mbps on US servers, ensuring buffer-free streaming.

# Large US Server Networks

More US servers mean more backup options when PBS blocks IPs. NordVPN and CyberGhost lead with hundreds of US servers across dozens of cities.

# No-Logs Policies

A verified no-logs policy ensures your VPN provider doesn't track or store your streaming activity. All our recommendations have undergone independent audits by firms like Deloitte, PwC, or Cure53.

# Multiple Device Support

Stream PBS on your laptop, phone, tablet, and smart TV simultaneously. Surfshark's unlimited connections and NordVPN's 10-device limit both accommodate typical household needs.

# Reliable Customer Support

When PBS blocks your server at 9 PM on a Friday, you need help immediately. All recommended providers offer 24/7 live chat support to troubleshoot issues in real-time.

# Money-Back Guarantees

Test your VPN risk-free with 30-day money-back guarantees (45 days for CyberGhost). This lets you confirm PBS compatibility before committing to a long-term subscription.

# Free VPNs vs. Paid VPNs for PBS

**Why Free VPNs Don't Work with PBS:**

1. **Limited Server Networks**: Free VPNs typically offer 5-10 servers total, with perhaps 1-2 in the US. When PBS blocks these IPs, free VPNs lack the infrastructure to replace them quickly.
2. **Slow Speeds**: Free VPNs deliberately throttle speeds to encourage upgrades. Expect speeds under 5 Mbps—insufficient for HD streaming.
3. **Data Caps**: Most free VPNs impose monthly limits (typically 500MB to 10GB), enough for perhaps 3-5 hours of SD streaming before hitting the cap.
4. **Overcrowded Servers**: Free VPN servers are severely overcrowded, leading to connection timeouts and buffering.
5. **Privacy Concerns**: Free VPNs must monetize somehow—many sell user data, inject ads, or engage in questionable practices to generate revenue.

**Reality Check**: We tested 15 popular free VPNs with PBS. Only two (ProtonVPN and Hide.me) occasionally connected, but both suffered from severe buffering due to speed limitations and server congestion. Neither provided a viable streaming experience.

**Better Alternative**: Premium VPNs cost $2-3/month on long-term plans—less than a single coffee. The reliability, speed, and server access you gain make the small investment worthwhile for quality PBS streaming.

# Legal and Ethical Considerations

# Is Using a VPN for PBS Legal?

Using a VPN to access PBS is technically against PBS's Terms of Service, which state that you should only access content available in your region. However, VPN usage itself is perfectly legal in the United States, Canada, and most countries worldwide.

PBS's official stance is that they ""do not support"" VPN usage to bypass geo-restrictions, but they don't actively pursue or penalize users. In practice, PBS's primary anti-VPN measure is blocking known VPN IP addresses—they don't ban user accounts or pursue legal action.

**Important Distinction**: Using a VPN to access PBS as a US citizen traveling abroad or to watch content from your home PBS station you already support through donations operates in a gray area. It's different from bypassing paywalls or accessing pirated content.

# Why PBS Has Geo-Restrictions

PBS's geo-restrictions stem from complex licensing agreements:

* PBS licenses programming from various producers, distributors, and international broadcasters
* These agreements often limit distribution rights to specific geographic territories
* International streaming rights typically cost significantly more than US-only rights
* Some PBS programs feature content licensed from UK broadcasters (like BBC's *Masterpiece* programs) with region-specific terms

As a publicly-funded nonprofit, PBS must carefully manage its budget and licensing costs. Expanding streaming access globally would require substantially higher licensing fees that PBS's funding model may not support.

# Supporting PBS

If you regularly watch PBS content via VPN, consider supporting PBS through donations:

* **PBS Passport**: $5/month or $60/year unlocks extended content while supporting public broadcasting
* **Local Station Donations**: Your contribution helps fund programming and local production
* **Fundraising Drives**: Participate in pledge drives to support specific programs you enjoy

Remember: PBS relies on viewer support to produce quality educational and cultural programming. If you value PBS content enough to VPN for access, consider contributing financially to ensure PBS can continue creating the content you love.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I watch PBS Passport content with a VPN?**

Yes, PBS Passport works with VPNs. You'll need both a VPN connection to a US server and an active PBS Passport membership (obtained through a $5/month or $60/year donation to your local PBS station). The VPN handles the geo-restriction while your Passport membership unlocks the extended content library.

**Which VPN has the most US servers for PBS?**

NordVPN leads with 1,970+ dedicated US servers, followed by Private Internet Access with over 1,000 US servers within its massive 35,000+ global network. More US servers mean more backup options when PBS blocks certain IPs.

**Can I use a free VPN to watch PBS?**

While technically possible, free VPNs provide an extremely poor PBS streaming experience. They suffer from slow speeds (typically under 5 Mbps), data caps (500MB-10GB/month), and overcrowded servers. In our testing, free VPNs couldn't maintain stable PBS streams without constant buffering. Premium VPNs cost just $2-3/month and deliver vastly superior performance.

**Why does PBS block VPNs?**

PBS blocks VPNs to comply with licensing agreements that restrict content distribution to specific geographic regions. By detecting and blocking VPN IP addresses, PBS ensures they don't violate their contracts with content producers and distributors who granted US/Canada-only streaming rights.

**Will my PBS account get banned for using a VPN?**

PBS doesn't ban user accounts for VPN usage. Their primary anti-VPN measure is simply blocking known VPN IP addresses. If detected, you'll see an error message but your account remains active. We've never encountered an account ban in years of VPN testing with PBS.

**Can I watch local PBS station livestreams with a VPN?**

Yes, but with a caveat: each PBS station's livestream is restricted to viewers in that station's broadcast coverage area. To watch a specific station's livestream, connect your VPN to a server in that station's city. For example, connect to a Boston server to watch WGBH's livestream.

**Does PBS work with VPNs on mobile devices?**

Yes, but mobile apps are trickier than browsers because they can detect your location via GPS. To stream PBS on mobile: (1) connect to your VPN, (2) disable location services for the PBS app, and (3) clear the app's cached data. For more reliable results, use the PBS website in your mobile browser instead of the app.

**What speed do I need to stream PBS in HD?**

PBS recommends at least 5 Mbps for HD streaming, though 8-10 Mbps provides a more comfortable buffer against fluctuations. All our recommended VPNs deliver speeds exceeding 50 Mbps on US servers—far more than sufficient for buffer-free HD streaming.

**Can I use a VPN on my smart TV to watch PBS?**

Yes, through several methods: (1) If your smart TV runs Android TV or Fire TV, install your VPN's app directly on the device. (2) For TVs without VPN apps (like Roku), use ExpressVPN's MediaStreamer DNS service or install your VPN on your router to protect all connected devices. (3) Some smart TVs allow VPN configuration through network settings.

**How do I know if my VPN is working with PBS?**

After connecting to a US server, visit whatismyipaddress.com to verify your IP shows a US location. Then navigate to PBS.org—if you can browse and play content without ""not available in your region"" errors, your VPN is working correctly. As an additional test, try playing a PBS Passport-exclusive video (even without a Passport subscription) to confirm you're not seeing regional blocks.

I send Christmas cards he sends Christmas cards to me but that's it now I've gone NC with my mother as he lives the other end of the country and I only ever saw him when he visited her.

  
Is there anyway I can reach out but in a way that is less likely to lay anything on him?

  
 Would it be OK to say in next Christmas card something like next time you're in the area would be lovely to catch up for a coffee if you happened to have time.

  
So not placing anything on him but also leaving an open invite?

  
I worry that perhaps I should apologise for having been a nightmare sister in many ways, but, also I don't want it to seem like I'm getting into stuff that he just doesn't want to get into....

  
He's always been kind to me but distant- and I just don't know what might be right thing.",1,1762855906.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False

1ou5n2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1ou5n2k/waking_up_to_the_truth/,Waking up to the truth,"I don’t know if anyone will care to read this, but this is a segment of my story with my parents. If anyone has any advice/any book recommendations/any specific therapy that has helped them, please let me know. 

I guess I always kind of knew deep down that my parents neglected me, that they lacked emotional maturity. I so badly didn’t want that to be the case so I really tried to paint them into this picture of being great parents.

I thanked them in every birthday card for their ongoing love and support and for being the best parents (again deep down I was hoping this would be a ‘fake it til you make it’ situation) and this is something they now use against me. 

Anyway I won’t go into all the details because that would be so long to read, but I guess my realisation fully came into play when my baby was born this year. I had expectations that giving them a grandchild would make them suddenly care about me and support me. I had a really tough time and a terrible birth injury and on top of that, me and my partner planned to live with my parents and brother at the beginning because a house we were in the process of buying fell through. From the first conversation on the phone with my mum I realised I was in for a rough ride with them and that their needs come first. My mum completely dismissed my injury and said she had something similar (she hadn’t) but “just had to get on with it.” 

My brother has a very different experience … he is on the spectrum but high functioning. I feel like they treated him different to me because he was always struggling in some way and maybe in a twisted way that boosted their self esteem? It’s like the 3 of them against me always.

We moved in with my father in law after a month. I still went back once a week, but filled with anger at every bit of aggravation they caused us. They treated my partner so bad that he wants nothing more to do with them. I went back because I wanted to let them know exactly how they had made me feel, but of course the more I explained the more it felt like talking to a brick wall. They turned it on me. My dad lost it and they both called me all the names under the sun, including “you’re a nasty piece of work”, “many women give birth - you’re not special” (my dad) and “I think unfortunately there is something very very wrong with you and I think you need help.” (My mum) well she is correct I need lots of therapy 😂 

I was crying my eyes out with 30 years of memories of feeling completely on my own. They just let me stand there. I was standing there with my beautiful baby and I just thought, how dare they? 

A few months later after no contact I decided that I need to accept them for who they are and that a distant relationship for me is better than no relationship at all. I have met them for coffee a couple of times, my dad is well behaved but my mum keeps making her digs. She wants to know constantly why she can’t log into my Amazon prime account anymore and as always - constantly bringing my brother up in a “poor him” way. She said over text that my “poor brother feels his relationship with me is over now that I have a partner and baby.” 

It’s a horrible realisation but also a weight lifted in some ways to see things for what they are. I know there’s always going to be issues with them but I no longer depend on them or need to live with them thankfully and hopefully that will always be the case.

1ou5mtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ou5mtf/why_i_never_tried_to_return_and_why_i_wont_now/,Why I never tried to return and why I won't now,"We haven't spoken really for quite some years. It seems strange that once upon a time, you felt like my entire world; now you are a complete stranger. Many years have passed since then, and I have changed quite a bit. I also have no idea what kind of person you are today.

When things ended with us back then, I was shattered. Your decision to call off the engagement and leave for good took me off guard. I never expected us to break. I didn't expect you to be so cold back then. You completely shut me out. One minute we were planning our future and the next, poof.... You were gone.

I only told one person this back then, but that night you left, my first thought was not despair or sadness; I felt relieved. I felt a sense of peace. I didn't understand it back then, but I know now why. Being with you sometimes felt like a cage. You had so many expectations of what I should be and what I should bring to the relationship that I always felt I was being pushed into things I didn't agree to. I mentioned on many occasions back then that I felt trapped.

I also did not know for sure back then, but I think I always felt that children were not something I wanted. You did. You wanted the perfect American dream, and you wanted to start building that when we were still so young. I did love you, and I was willing to give you that dream, but I think it would have been the death of me. I would have resented you so much had that happened.

I did try to get you back once, about a month after the break. I'm not sure if you remember, but I missed you so much back then, and I really needed you. Instead, what I saw that night and the things you said made me realise it was over for good. So, I decided I wouldn't return. Then the relapse happened, and for a week or two, we had fun. We didn't think about ""us"", we just enjoyed each other's company. Then I heard you had started dating someone else. So I had to let you go; she didn't deserve to have ""the ex"" still in the picture.

Sending you that last very lengthy email was my swan song. I wanted you to be happy with her. I wanted you to have the life you always wanted, and I finally realised I could not give that to you. It wasn't easy. I tried everything to forget you and move on. I moved, tried changing my social circles, but since we had the same friends, you were always there. Like a shadow that always follows, but eventually you become just a memory.

When I saw the pictures of your wedding, entirely by accident, I wasn't actively looking, but one of your friends shared them on Facebook, and I saw them. I was so happy for you; I didn't feel angry or envious. I was delighted you were living the life you wanted. You looked so happy and fulfilled, so I sent a congrats through the universe and continued on. 

I was doing well for a while; I met someone I really liked, and things between us were becoming more serious. I knew he wanted to take that next step, and it scared the ever-loving hell out of me, because I didn't think there was going to be another after you. I wasn't ready for the significant commitment, so I did what I always do: I ran. It was during those few months when I was entirely on my own that I realised I needed some therapy.

I embarked on a journey and resolved some of my past traumas. I realised that it wasn't you who made me afraid to commit, but that I have been afraid of commitment even since I was a child. I did not have a great example of a good, healthy relationship, and that is what ruled my decisions. Once I dealt with those, I also had to deal with family drama. That blew up in my face. Therapy is excellent for oneself, but joint therapy is a different monster.

I did feel that something was missing and that I was longing for someone; it was him. I never should have run from him, and I realised he really was the one meant for me. I was scared and pushed him away, but unlike you, when we met up again, we did talk about ""us"". He was the one I wanted to be there forever. Since then, I haven't really looked back anymore. There were no more ""what if"" or ""could have been"".

I never expected to see you again or hear from you. That chapter was finally over, and I knew we had both found the place we belonged. So I didn't try to come back at all; I even disappeared from all social media. I was, and am, living the life I wanted with the person who is my other half.

I don't want you back in my life, not even as friends. You and I do not belong in each other's lives. It has been proven so many times. Every now and then, I hear your name mentioned, especially by family members who are still asking about you. I shut that down every time. I don't know why they still cling to you like that. If you're in contact with them, it's fine; it's your choice, but please refrain from bringing it to my front porch. This year was the last time, I hope they finally realise that as well. I am angry with them for interfering where they shouldn't.

I think about you sometimes, and I reminisce about the old days, but it does not linger. I look at it with fondness of where I was and where I am now. Honestly, most of the memories have faded by now. I have so many others that have taken their place, and I am sure it's the same for you.

I hope you are keeping well and that you are happy. I apologize for the call earlier in the year; I was hoping you would be honest. I did not expect you would, so when you lied, it just confirmed again that leaving it all behind is for the best. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but maybe if you were honest, we could have met for coffee, but you weren't. You do not have to worry that I will reappear in your life again, and I hope you keep your distance from mine. 

I loved you once with everything I had, and it hurt when you left, but that was the end for me, and there is no scenario I can think of that would convince me to return. I did not write this to hurt anyone but to let you know that there is no resentment, only indifference. Our time was over long ago, and I am not someone who lives in the past. You will always hold a place in my heart, and even to this day, I will always love the version of you I once loved, but we both know we are different people now.

1ou5lsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ou5lsu/is_this_neckthroat_pain_serious_and_could_this_be/,Is this neck/throat pain serious? And could this be connected to other things?,"14F, underweight ~38kg, asian and no neck or head trauma, but i have been accidentally bumping the top of my head a couple of times.

Ive had this weird sensation on my neck for like the past couple of months. Maybe since August-September. I always thought i was just straining my neck, but it comes on so  randomly so i dont know. Whenever im chewing, boom! It feels like someone is pinching my neck/nerve? or even pulling it. It doesnt hurt that much, and theres always no symptoms before, during, or even after. It always happens quick. One time in class, i was just writing and i looked up slightly, and it was the worst ive ever felt on the area on top of the collarbones. After this, i never got that feeling for a while. It came back after a week or so but as like short, dull and doesnt hurt. When the worst ive ever felt it happened, literally nothing else happened. It just hurt. I didnt lose vision, hearing, or consciousness thankfully. It just...hurt. i have been getting these lesser and lesser, but i still get them. 

Also, hasnt happend recently but back then (2-3 months back) my jaw and collarbones would get numb/tingle during night at around 7-8 pm. And ive heard like a soft beat in my ears, more on my left and sometimes on my right. I also recently had a ringing on my right ear when i suddenly just woke up (suddenly waking up happens to me occasionally.) and early into this year i heard my heartbeat for a few seconds on my left ear. I dont know if this is relevent, connected or not. Im just concerned.
-i have told my mom about this part, but not the first paragraph since ive been convincing myself its harmless. 

And these symptoms only appeared when i was sent to the ER (March 2) because of low blood sugar. I was at church, 3pm so it was hot. I was with my brother and my grandma and we were holding hands and singing Our Father. I yawned and came to my vision were black dots on the centre of my vision. Slowly, my hearing started to get muffled, and i was feeling cold and weak on my legs. My brother said my lips were turning white FAST. My vision changed from purple and black and i could barely hear my grandma. On the way to the ER, i was crying and my vision and hearing became normal. The doctor at the ER said it was hypoglycemia. Then, it happened again around September. But it was different. I was watching a video on the tv, i was pretty close to the tv since our couch was close, and i was eating chips. That pain on the side of my neck or throat came again, not that painful but i felt anxious. Slowly, i was pacing around the living room. 

(I drank three cups of iced coffee that i made that had 1 teaspoon of coffee, and a lot of milk. And i slept at 1am that time.)

When i went to check myself in the mirror, i saw my lips turning white. I ran to my brother and told him. He sat me down on the couch and made me drink this Electrorush drink (recommended by the ER doctor) and a lot of candies and water. I wanted to go to the ER since my face (chubbier side of my face) was feeling a bit numb. But when the doctor came to check on me, i forgot to mention that part. The numbness went away when i stopped crying and when i got out of the cold ER room. 

When my mom and i went to the doctor to check on whatever what was going on, it was all normal other than my BMI. The doctor said that i was perectly healthy, ECG, and x-ray were all normal. Thyroid tests that i had were all normal too. And i was just way too underweight
-maybe this is irrelevant but back in Feb-Mar, i was 41kg for the first time since i was 11. Then suddenly, when i went to the ER a second time, i was 39. When my mom and i went to the doctor, 38.5. then when we went to get the consultation, 38kg. I dont exercise, i ran track and field back at March 50 meters twice, and i ran track and field this October 100m and 50m. Other than that, all i do is shove food in my face and sit on my ass watching anime. Ive always had a problem with my weight and food ever since i was a kid. And yes, sometimes i do skip lunch but thats because i would eat a lot of things during recess (9:30-10:00) in my school so i didnt feel full enough for lunch. 

so basically: (sorry if some info wasnt on the long paragraphs...)
- unknown pulling/pinching feeling on my throat and ive felt two painful sensations. Feeling comes occasionally, and has no other symptoms.
- Left Jaw and collarbones getting numb/tingly. Always happens at night but hasnt happened in a long time.
- ringing in one ear a few minutes after suddenly waking up and went away after a few seconds. heard my own heartbeat Feb-Mar on my left ear while answering math for about an hour that lasted a short while too. + Soft beats that happen on both ears, but more on the left.
- feb-mar too, i was 41kg, dropped to 39 somehow, then final weight is 38kg. I ran track and field twice this year, March and then also October but i dont exercise at all after or even before these events.
- went to the ER for low blood sugar + doctor said might be because it was hot, stayed up late (slept at 3am that time), and probably dehydrated. Was told to get thyroid tested and told to drink an Electrorush drink just in case it might happen again.
- the second painful neck/throat pain happened, didnt hurt much, then i felt anxious. Almost fainted, probably. I was drinking coffee, eating chips, watching tv, i like had diarrhea/i just kept pooping like liquidy poops. and before all of that i was in online class for 8 hours.
- went to the ER again but doctor said it was probably because i stayed up late, and because of the coffee.
- mom and i went to get checked up, and Thyroid, ECG, X-Ray were all normal. BMI was bad, and blood pressure and blood...levels? I dont know what its called but its when they take ur blood. And they were on the border of being normal.
- was told i cant stay up late (bedtime now is 10:30pm, 11pm at the latest,) no more coffee, and no skipping meals, even when full. My friends know about this so everytime im not eating they force me to at least take a few bites.",1,1762855298.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

1ou5j6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1ou5j6n/i_broke_my_screen_addiction_without_deleting_a/,I BROKE my screen addiction without deleting a single app,"I used to reach my phone before I even opened my eyes, not to check time, not because someone texted but just because. At one point it became so automatic that it was just my muscle memory at one point, like my thumb remember to unlock the phone. I was literally spending 6-7 hrs a day on my phone scrolling without any reason. Scroll, open ig/yt/reddit close then open again, close then the loop goes on.

Does anyone else also just feel exhausted all the time no matter what they do? 

Like i sit with my coffee and plan my day like I'm some kind of CEO or what planning my day on the notes app. It does looks productive, but somehow I still do absolutely nothing. Hours just vanish into scrolling random a$$ sh\*t on ig reels or yt shots and then i feel worse like I'm stuck in an infinite loop fr.

My energy is unpredictable. Like on some days i get these random bursts and my brain wants to do everything at once. Other times i just scroll for 6 hours straight. either way, my to-do list laughs at me.

even the “just do one small thing” advice feels heavy when your energy’s shot. and when i do get a rare window of energy? i waste it switching between apps like a maniac until it’s gone. rinse. repeat.

but here’s what kinda helped without deleting any apps:

* i moved all the scroll traps aka social apps (insta, reddit, youtube etc.) off my home screen and buried them deep in a random folder. Replaced that space with notes, calendar, or just boring apps. Girl also use that black and white/grayscale mode i assure you that you don't wan use your phone no longer. And do some sort of physical activity be it walking or just anything that requires your body to make a movement.
* i also stopped scheduling by time and started planning to do it in the exact moment I feel like doing it
* Lately I’ve been trying to take real breaks like going for a short walk, or sitting quietly with a cup of coffee. **Allowing myself** moments to **feel boredom**. Be it any random thing from sitting and stare at a wall for 10 minutes. Then 15 and then 20. Set an alarm and don't move until it rings. Don't worry about filling it, be okay with just getting bored.

I couldn’t resist and went to talk to him. I was very emotional, and so was he. He was at a bar with a colleague. The colleague was drinking a coffee, and he… a cocktail. I asked him if he was happy after the break-up, and he said no. I asked if he understood why things ended between us. He said: alcohol. Then he started telling me that he wants us to get back together, that it doesn’t make sense to be apart. I asked for a long period of sobriety, even just for having a coffee. At least six months. His eyes widened. He laughed, nervously. Then he insisted, saying that we should be together, but of course, he doesn’t even seriously consider the idea of quitting. He says it will take time, and in the meantime, he wants to be with me.

After a year and a half, for me, he’s had several chances. I experienced what many go through here on the subreddit: ups and downs, emotional disconnection, disappearing acts, irritability. He’s a good man (never violent) but very sick, and he absolutely refuses to start a path of recovery, even if he says he wants to do it, in practice he does nothing. I suggested seeing each other in a week, on the condition that he stays sober. I know I made a mistake. I know he won’t do it.

The strange thing is that after a month of no contact, I’m doing fairly well. I still love him, but I’ve accepted that I cannot change him or force him to quit. But I just wanted him to be confronted, one last time, with the consequences of his choices. Choosing alcohol means losing me.",1,1762854647.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

But that’s exactly where Moola Monday comes in. Hot tech at hot prices that’ll keep your wallet from crying.

Today, we’re showing off three killer Redragon keyboards that you can pick up.

The perfect companion to the free Redragon Gaming mouse, Evetech deskpad, C2Kit retro PC, and Rocomamas lunch that you get when you purchase your [NAG Retro LAN](https://shop.nag.co.za/product/nag-retro-lan-ticket/) ticket!

So get those index fingers ready, it’s time to add to cart!



**Redragon Mechanical Dragonborn RGB TKL Keyboard**  
**Price:** *R549, marked down from R699*  
[**Get It Here**](https://www.incredible.co.za/redragon-mechanical-dragonborn-rgb-tkl-keyboard)

Ah, the humble TKL. A pro-gamer’s preferred choice when it comes to keyboard sizes.

All the keys you need, none of the keys you don’t, because who’s running Excel spreadsheets off their numpad when they’re neck deep in an Elden Ring boss fight?

The Redragon Dragonborn TKL is compact and ultra-portable. It comes with 13 pre-loaded RGB styles that can be customised from the keyboard itself, and has red linear switches, perfect for FPS gamers.

They offer speed where it matters most.

However, it doesn’t just end there. If you’re into modding your keyboard, the red switches are hot-swappable, meaning you can always upgrade the switches later or change them out should one fail.

Its L-shaped USB-C cable also helps with space-saving, a nice little feature to have on a wired keyboard.

For less than R600, this is definitely a decent piece of hardware for a great price.



**Redragon Surara Mechanical RGB Gaming Keyboard**  
**Price:** *R729, marked down from R829*  
[**Get It Here**](https://www.takealot.com/redragon-surara-mechanical-rgb-gaming-keyboard-black/PLID90028239)

If the numpad is an absolute necessity, then you should check out the Redragon Surara.

Another gaming keyboard that comes standard with the hot-swappable red linear switches, which are smooth and quick for FPS gaming; however, this keyboard has all the keys.

It also comes pre-loaded with 18 RGB colour options, giving you complete control of the colours on your desk.

With its ABS keycaps and hot-swappable capabilities, the Surura is definitely a keyboard built to last.



**Redragon RD-K618 RGB-PRO Gaming Keyboard**  
**Price:** *R1,699, marked down from R1,999*  
[**Get It Here** ](https://www.makro.co.za/redragon-rd-k618rgb-pro-gaming-keyboard/p/itme8e0c0398f783?pid=KBDH4BAUUVEXGSEK&srsltid=AfmBOoprDVDuQCdrH2yWFAew1xhZPxYrUro7bjkXCIx69rexnTiB_3LXGHA)

For those who demand freedom from cables and crumbs, the RD-K618RGB-PRO is your sleek ticket to wireless glory.

Designed for those who want laptop-style low-profile keys but still crave that tactile Redragon click, this keyboard is basically the mechanical version of business class.

With a multimode connection setup, you can pair it via Bluetooth on two devices and through 2.4GHz wireless, meaning you can seamlessly switch between gaming on your C2Kit retro rig and pretending to work on your laptop.

Its low-profile keycaps make every press smooth, responsive, and far quieter than that one friend who insists on bottoming out every keystroke.

Plus, it’s thin, light, and portable – perfect for LANs, home setups, or showing off your RGB skills in coffee shops where people are just trying to read in peace.



So there you have it, three Redragon keyboards to suit every gamer, every desk setup, and every budget.

Whether you’re going full TKL minimalist, keeping it classic with a full layout, or embracing the wireless life, there’s a dragon out there waiting to light up your desk.

And remember: your [NAG Retro LAN](https://shop.nag.co.za/product/nag-retro-lan-ticket/) Ticket already comes with a Redragon mouse. So don’t leave it lonely.

Pair it with one of these bad boys, gear up, and get ready to make some glorious click-clack chaos.

I (22 female) live in an upstairs apartment in a part of town that is getting a lot nicer. A lot of new buildings and coffee shops and stuff. My rent is high but my boyfriend and I can manage. Downstairs lives this woman I will call the Mom Downstairs. She is in her 40s and has three kids and she is really having a hard time. Like, really hard. Her apartment is always a mess and she has that dog that is always chained up on the porch. You can just tell life has not been kind to her.

Me being a person who cares about social issues, I try to be an ally. I know she is in a cycle of poverty and the system is not built for people like her. So I try to help. I give her my leftover food sometimes or old clothes my boyfriend and I don't wear anymore. I bought her kids some coloring books for the holidays. I really just want her to know that someone sees her and cares.

Well, a few weeks ago she mentioned to me how hard it was to afford certain things for herself and her oldest girl, like pads and tampons. She said the store prices are a joke and she just doesn't have the extra money after bills. I felt so bad for her. It is not right that anybody has to choose between food and basic dignity. So a couple days later I went to the store and I bought a big box of tampons and some pads and I left the bag on her doorstep with a note that said I was thinking of her. I didn't want to make it a big deal or make her feel bad.

So here is where I might be the a-hole. The other night I was coming home late and I saw her kind of lingering near my car. I didn't think anything of it because neighbors walk by all the time. The next morning I went to get something from my glove box and I noticed it was open. I always keep it locked but I guess I forgot. My emergency first aid kit was opened, and the little pouch of pads I keep in there for myself was totally empty.

I am not 100% sure it was her but it seems very likely. A couple of other small things were gone too, like a pack of gum and a phone charger I kept in the center console. Nothing huge, but it was my stuff.

I was so confused and my heart sank. I waited a day because I didn't want to make a scene. Then I knocked on her door and just asked her if she had seen anyone messing with cars in the lot. She got really quiet and then she just started crying. She admitted it was her. She said her girl started her period that morning and they had nothing and she panicked. She said she was sorry but she also got a little mad and said I have plenty of money and what was a few pads to me was a big deal to them.

I just stood there. I didn't know what to say. On one hand I feel so incredibly sad for her. She was right. I have so much privilege and it was nothing for me to replace what she took. On the other hand, she went into my personal vehicle and took my things without asking. I already gave her a whole bag of that stuff. Now I feel like I can't trust her. I told her she could have just knocked on my door and I would have helped, but I also told me that she can't just take things ever again. She called me fake and said I just wanted to feel like a savior and then slammed the door in my face.

Now I feel horrible. I haven't talked to her since. I feel like if I was a true ally I would just let it go because she has so little and I have so much. My boyfriend says I'm a doormat and I was just enabling her and that this was always going to happen. My mom says I have every right to be angry and violated. But I can't shake the feeling that somebody with so much shouldn't be mad at somebody with so little for trying to survive.

So AITA for being mad at her and ending our friendship?",3,1762853526.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I’m Nico, and after thousands of hours playing this beautiful chaos simulator we call *Satisfactory*, I wanted to share a bit of what I’ve learned about fluid dynamics.

I’m the kind of weird player who sets strict world rules—one of them being *worldwide full efficiency*.

https://preview.redd.it/o1l7togdal0g1.jpg?width=888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e43aa9295d593a405d10837d2523bdcad3119e7e

Now, building a “fully efficient” world isn’t that hard. The real enemy? Fluids.  
If my power line ever got wobbly, 19 out of 20 times the culprit was fluid dynamics. I’ve spent hundreds of hours yelling at pipes, rebuilding systems, and questioning my life choices—until finally, I reached a point where I can build comfortably, and those pipes don’t dare provoke me anymore.

I’m not doing a full guide here. I just want to give some simple, real-world examples that might save you from a few headaches—mainly about merging pipes and splitting pipes.

**Disclaimer:**  
If I told you I could teach you how to never have problems with liquids, I’d be lying. Fluid dynamics in Satisfactory are mysterious and borderline chaotic. Some systems are more likely to fail, some less likely. What actually happens? Only the gods of chaos know!  
So if your setup doesn’t behave exactly like mine, it doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong—it just means you’ve angered a different pipe deity.

Alright, let’s dive in!

# Splitting Pipes

Splitting pipes is one of the most common things to do. Dividing one pipe into several machines sounds simple, but it’s one of the biggest sources of headaches in the game. I’ve tested several topologies until I finally found one that, to this day, has never failed me.

Let’s start by looking at real examples:

On this last one, I want to point something out: those are Mk.2 pipes, running consistently at 600 m³/min.

https://preview.redd.it/3tu8clgwbl0g1.jpg?width=1232&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c1a20b061a58623ab630eedbdd4e1ad0e230f41

So why is this way of connecting machines so special? Because it actually works!

Let’s break it down. In the image below, green arrows show where fluids can flow, and red arrows show where they can’t.

https://preview.redd.it/ve8edf84cl0g1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=9120385cca605a3b7ac0fa09499deb0bfc3cb71e

This topology combines two things: gravity and loops. The twist is that the loop is enforced by gravity itself.

Pipes are bi-directional, but gravity can make them behave as if they weren’t.  
Here’s the structure, from bottom to top:

* Bottom level: machines
* Above that: pipe manifold
* Above that: loop feeding the manifold
* And even higher: the liquid source

To this day, this is the only connection method that has never failed me.

# How do I build that crap?

Yes, I know. It looks like a nightmare to build — and honestly, it kind of is. It takes a bit more time, but it’s worth it.  
You can make it easier by creating a **blueprint of just the junction**. These systems use vertical junctions, which you can’t place easily (Coffee Stain, pick up the phone — let us rotate junctions on the other axis!).

Once you have it on a blueprint, though, it’s smooth sailing: just place the junction where you need it and nudge it into position.

# Merging Pipes

Alright, I know I’m going to get some hate for saying this… but if you can, **avoid merging pipes**.

It’s common to see people saying it’s impossible to have a pipe flowing steadily at 600. They’re not entirely wrong — it *is* possible, but it’s also extremely tricky. The real question is: *where does that 600 come from?*

If you’re merging 20 refineries to get 600 fuel, the bottleneck probably isn’t the pipe’s capacity — it’s the merging itself.

In my whole world (and it’s a big one), I have only four pipes running at 600. Those come from pure oil nodes. Everywhere else, I try to avoid merging pipes and simply lay more pipes at lower flow rate. 

**Give me an example!**

Let’s say you have four refineries feeding eight fuel generators.  
Let’s compare these two setups:

https://preview.redd.it/uvdrnxt1jl0g1.jpg?width=2605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b39d2851a69f587135e8666ec5030fd4e7e0426

I’m not saying the setup on the left is wrong or broken — it might work perfectly.  
But if you build the one on the right and add a few extra pipes, it’s far less likely that any fuel generator will ever starve.

# But, I cant always do that! How do I merge pipes?

Yes, there are times when you don’t have clean ratios like that, and you actually need to merge pipes.  
Let me show you a few examples of how I handle it.

https://preview.redd.it/hioszky5el0g1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5064dd4a521e4f2311ba972e799c5a121fbb76c

https://preview.redd.it/ngysdp37el0g1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=15e46201b1ec614df3b36d8b30c9c436ed510ed7

Is this an exaggeration?  
Probably.  
Does it work?  
Yes. Absolutely.

Again, I’m using gravity. Each “liquid producer” pumps up to a higher level, and from that point on, the only way is down. This prevents liquids from competing against each other in the same line.

Liquids will never flow up if there’s a “down” they can go to — that’s the rule I live by.

# What about gases?

That’s a different story. Gases are special.  
They’re extremely unlikely to cause you problems — but when they do… oh boy, you’re in for some pain. All of these solutions rely on gravity, and gases don’t care about gravity. So, most of what I’ve said here doesn’t really apply to them.

I want to keep this post short, so I won’t dive into gases now. But if people find this useful, I might make a follow-up focusing just on that.

Hope you found this post interesting — and maybe it helps you in your liquid adventures!  
If you’ve made it this far, I’ll assume you enjoyed it, so I’ll be bold enough to plug myself a little bit:

I have a small, non-monetized YouTube channel where I explain things like this and build convoluted, over-engineered stuff for fun.  
If that sounds like your kind of madness, come say hi! You can find me on YouTube as **NicoBuilds**.

Be happy, stay efficient, pet your lizard doggos, and may you always stay clear of stingers.  
Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a megafactory to get back to.

I want to confess my feelings to a guy I like, but I’m unsure how to approach it without making things awkward or ruining our current connection.

Context:
I’m F20 and I really like this guy who’s M24. We talk almost every day and I feel very comfortable and happy when I’m chatting with him. He’s kind, respectful, and someone I genuinely admire. He also sings and performs gigs, and I’ve always had a soft spot for guys who sing, which is one of the reasons I was drawn to him.
The issue is that he’s pretty well-known locally because of his performances, and I feel intimidated. I get shy and I’m afraid that if I tell him how I feel, he might not take it seriously or it might make things awkward between us.


So far, I haven’t tried directly expressing my feelings. I’ve considered inviting him for coffee, just the two of us, so I can talk to him in person in a sincere way. However, I don’t know how to start the conversation or how to express my feelings without sounding awkward.

1ou4y7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bloggerblog/comments/1ou4y7e/the_rise_of_digital_outofhome_advertising/,The Rise of Digital Out-of-Home Advertising: Transforming Public Spaces into Smart Marketing Platforms,"**The Evolution of Outdoor Advertising**  
Outdoor advertising has long been a vital part of the marketing mix, capturing the attention of people on the move through billboards, posters, and transit displays. However, with technological innovation and the growing demand for data-driven marketing, traditional static displays are rapidly being replaced by digital out-of-home (DOOH) advertising. DOOH integrates digital screens, interactive technology, and real-time data to deliver dynamic, engaging messages in public spaces. From digital billboards on highways to smart displays in shopping malls and airports, this form of advertising has transformed the way brands communicate with audiences outside their homes. It bridges the gap between offline and online experiences, offering flexibility, creativity, and measurable results that were previously impossible in conventional outdoor media.

**The Power and Reach of Digital Out-of-Home**  
One of the key strengths of digital out-of-home advertising lies in its ability to reach massive audiences in high-traffic locations. Unlike television or online ads that rely on user behavior or subscriptions, DOOH captures real-world attention from pedestrians, commuters, and shoppers who naturally engage with their surroundings. Studies have shown that digital billboards and screens attract significantly more attention and recall compared to static ones, thanks to motion graphics, video content, and bright, high-resolution displays. In urban centers, transport hubs, and entertainment districts, DOOH campaigns can be tailored to target specific demographics at specific times of the day. For example, brands can promote coffee during morning rush hours and entertainment content in the evening. This contextual and time-based targeting maximizes engagement and improves return on investment (ROI) for advertisers. **For more:** [**digital out of home**](https://en.kinglight.com/blog/what-is-digital-out-of-home-dooh-advertising.html)

**The Integration of Technology and Data Analytics**  
The real magic of digital out-of-home advertising lies in its integration with advanced technology and data analytics. Modern DOOH networks are often connected to the internet, enabling advertisers to manage campaigns remotely and update content instantly. With the help of artificial intelligence, facial recognition, and mobile data tracking, advertisers can analyze audience behavior, demographics, and engagement patterns in real time. For instance, a digital billboard equipped with sensors can adjust content based on environmental conditions like weather, temperature, or even traffic flow. Moreover, programmatic DOOH advertising allows for automated buying and placement of ads, similar to online ad exchanges. This ensures that marketing budgets are optimized, as campaigns are delivered at the right place, at the right time, to the right audience. Data-driven insights also enable brands to measure campaign performance, something traditional outdoor advertising could never provide with such accuracy.

**Creative Potential and Consumer Engagement**  
Digital out-of-home advertising opens up endless creative possibilities for brands to connect with consumers in memorable ways. With interactive touchscreens, augmented reality (AR), and social media integration, DOOH campaigns can invite real-time audience participation. For example, interactive digital bus stops can let users play games, take selfies, or scan QR codes for exclusive offers. These experiences create an emotional connection between the consumer and the brand, increasing brand recall and loyalty. Additionally, many brands now combine DOOH with mobile marketing to create seamless omnichannel experiences. A passerby might see a digital ad on a street screen and receive a personalized offer on their smartphone moments later. This synergy between digital channels not only enhances engagement but also drives measurable actions such as app downloads, store visits, and online purchases.

**The Future of Digital Out-of-Home Advertising**  
As cities become smarter and more connected, the future of digital out-of-home advertising looks brighter than ever. The adoption of 5G networks, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and AI-powered analytics will further enhance the precision and interactivity of DOOH campaigns. Advertisers will be able to integrate live data sources such as sports scores, news updates, or weather forecasts into their content, keeping their messages fresh and relevant. Sustainability will also play a crucial role, as digital screens replace printed posters, reducing paper waste and carbon emissions. Moreover, the increasing affordability of LED technology will make it easier for smaller businesses to participate in DOOH advertising, democratizing access to public visibility. In a world where consumers are constantly bombarded with online ads, digital out-of-home provides a refreshing, high-impact medium that blends creativity, technology, and human interaction in the physical world.

**Conclusion**  
Digital out-of-home advertising is redefining the boundaries of traditional marketing by transforming everyday environments into smart, interactive communication platforms. Its combination of broad reach, real-time flexibility, and technological innovation makes it one of the most powerful and future-proof forms of advertising available today. As audiences continue to spend more time in public spaces, DOOH will play a central role in shaping how brands connect, engage, and inspire consumers across the globe. For marketers looking to stand out in a crowded media landscape, digital out-of-home offers not just visibility—but lasting impact.",1,1762852784.0,Bloggerblog,0,1.0,False

Mum goes to get a table and i place our order at the counter, get the number beeper and join my mum. Staff are indeed wearing all black BUT with their signature purple aprons.

The tables are placed like a U with tables in the middle of that U. We're seated on the left side. The table across from us, the other side of the middle row, are a group of Chinese tourists. At the bottom of the U is a table of local Chinese. I am not Chinese by the way. I'm Malay.

I wanted to get expert opinions on my new diet.

First some context: I'm a 33 year old man, 190cm tall and weigh around 80kg. I would say I'm ""mildly active"" in the sense that I don't work out but I walk a lot every day including a lot of uphill walking. I've always struggled to keep weight on ever since I was about 20 so I'm not too concerned about a surplus in calories. I've finally decided to regulate my diet to try to combat years of tiredness and fatigue, and this is what I came up with:

**Breakfast: Yoghurt with Fruit**

* 250ml of Greek yoghurt (plain/natural)
* 1 banana
* 1 kiwi

**Lunch: Fish w/ Potatoes and Salad**

* 125g fish, fried in a pan (usually salmon so far but plan to rotate this with other fish)
* 2 medium boiled potatoes, covered in some olive oil and 1 tsp of dijon
* A small salad consisting of half a shredded carrot, a leafy green (rotating between spinach, romaine hearts, arugula and kale), a small bell pepper, 2 tbsp of sunflower or sesame seeds and 30 grams of nuts (cashews, almonds, walnuts, rotating).

**Dinner: Chicken or Beef Wraps**

* 3 flour tortillas
* 1 large chicken breast or 250g of minced beef, fried (rotating)
* Seasoning (tandoori spice, garlic powder, pepper, cumin, chili powder)
* 75g of feta or goat cheese (rotating)
* A leafy green or cabbage (spinach, romaine hearts or red cabbage, rotating)
* Half an avocado
* 3 other vegetables, rotating (tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, mushrooms, bell pepper, carrots)
* A tiny bit of yoghurt sauce and sriracha mayo

**Snacks (infrequent, not every day):**

* Green apple
* Cashews

**Drinks:**

* At least 3l of water
* 2-3 sugar free generic lemon sodas from Carrefour
* 3-4 cups of coffee (half decaf, half regular)

I know the diet is high in sodium, but other than that, how would you guys rate this diet from a nutritional standpoint? I'm basically doing an experiment right now where I eat this every single day for at least 2 months to see what it does to my general life experience.

1ou4p4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ou4p4i/aitah_for_cheating_on_my_bf_after_he_cheated_on/,AITAH for cheating on my bf after he cheated on me first ?,"I (21 female) have been with my bf (24 male)( let’s call him D for privacy reasons) for a little over a year now. We met on hinge and immediately hit it off. We started hanging out more and more and then eventually started dating. We have a great chemistry and are very comfortable around each other. But about eight months into the relationship, I finally went through his phone because I kept hearing things about people cheating on social media and that made me insecure for a while and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Not expecting to actually find anything in his phone because I thought our relationship was really healthy, I went through his TikTok account and went to his like history. He had been liking and keeping up with an insane amount of female thirst traps the entire time we were dating. I decided to work things out with him after he apologized multiple times and told him not to do it again because it made me very uncomfortable. 

2months later  we decided to move in together in an apt. One of the main reasons he wanted to get the apt together after our previous fallout was because he wanted to prove how much he cared about me and wanted to make me feel special again. I was nervous though about moving in with him because I was 20 at the time and had never lived with a guy I dated before. I was also worried it was a bad idea at the time because I still was trying to get over his lusting online thing from before. But he convinced me that moving in together would make our relationship stronger. 

It was exciting and fun the first 2 months we lived together, But I had trouble sleeping because I was so used to sleeping in a bed by myself most of the time before and because he snored pretty often, almost every single night and I’m a light sleeper. So sometimes I would go to my mother‘s house, which was 10 minutes away to get a little bit of rest and then be back by the morning. We both keep up with each other‘s Life360 so I didn’t think it would bother him too much especially since we had already talked about this Before and he agreed it was OK. 

Turns out he was actually not OK with that and I later went on to find out that he had made a new tinder account, that one of my friends had sent me. I confronted him about it as soon as I saw him. He claimed he got on tinder and talked to multiple women because he was preparing to move on because he thought I was leaving to sleep at my moms because I was going to leave him. I was blindsided. I and no idea he was feeing this way. When I confronted him and told him that we had already talked about this and I’ve been having trouble sleeping, He said he knows but he just thought that was my way of slowly telling him I wanted to leave him. We went on to have an intense conversation for hours where he kept apologizing but i just couldn’t bear the heartbreak so i walked to my car crying and left to my mothers house. 

I stayed there for weeks and after we kept talking about it and he kept apologizing I realized that there was a lack of communication and i ultimately decided even though i was still heartbroken about it, to work things out with him.

Weeks went by after that and I just felt numb. I had never been with a guy that cheated on me before and I was feeling pathetic staying with him but I don’t like giving up on people I really care about. I had a moment of resentment and weakness and downloaded hinge again one night. I knew it was wrong but I felt I needed to see if there was any sparks with another Person on there before I could know for sure that I wanted to continue to move forward with D. 

I was honestly enjoying the attention and started to feel attractive again talking to these other men. But despite the attention I was getting from them I still didn’t feel any spark at all with them. I went on to actually meet with one of the guys on the dating app later that week at a coffee shop but it went super badly and they were very rude so I went home and deleted their number. I realized that I didn’t want to be with anyone else and decided to move forward in patching up my relationship with D. 

Later that night while I was sleeping, I wake up to him yelling at me and asking me “WTF why did I have hinge and what were these messages with this other guy”. I told him I was really sorry and kept apologizing for doing this to him. I went ahead and started to pack a bag to stay at my mothers house bc I felt that’s what i should do since I was so wrong to cheat on him too. He asked me not to go and that he wanted me to stay to talk about it more and why I felt the need to do it. 

After 2 hours of intense conversation and lots of tears on both parts we went silent but then started laughing awkwardly bc we didn’t know what to do at that point. By the end of the conversation, we both looked at each other and he said he knows he f****d up too and didn’t blame me for doing it. I didn’t feel better about him saying that because I knew it was wrong and I told him that I still didn’t think he deserved it and I was so sorry for being so immature and unfaithful. We agreed that we’d do couples counseling after that but it’s been weeks and we haven’t really talked about it or made any moves towards scheduling a counseling appointment. 

We both love each other so much but it’s just so toxic right now and feels like we’re just ignoring our problems. I just dont know, What do we do now ?  Is the relationship repairable ? AITAH ? Because i definitely feel like i am. ",3,1762851798.0,AITAH,26,1.0,False

1ou4mrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ou4mrx/started_feeling_pain_again_after_2_years/,Started feeling pain again after 2 years.,"About two years ago, in early 2024, my then girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me. We were 17, and I know it sounds silly compared to so many of the stories on this sub, but I legitimately thought she was the love of my life. I knew her family 'despite us living in quite a conservative society), her every secrets, we had shared three of the most important years in one's development. 

She loved me at a time where I was insecure, ugly, depressed, my family was falling apart and my mom had cancer. She was my first love and I thought she was the person for me, the love of my life. Then it happened, she got fed up with my anxiety and insecurities and she broke up with me, after a few weeks of us growing distant from one another. As one can imagine, the initial shock was devastating. I cried for weeks, isolated myself and barely ate. Then I slowly started getting better, I started working out, got closer with my friends, started going out more and meeting new people. By December 2024, I had accomplished exceptional things for a 17 year old in my country. I did some youth activism, journalism, I went on national TV more times than I can remember, won writing competitions, went massively viral on instagram on a couple of occasions, and generally became a funnier, more confident, better human being. 

And yet she lingered in the back of my mind, despite the new girlfriends, the success and the wonderful friends around me. I periodically tried to reconnect with her, but she was always awfully cold and I couldn't blame her, I knew how much she put pressure on herself to absolutely ace our high school final exam, to achieve her dream of studying in London. In August of 2025 tho, I decided that maybe now was the time to start talking again. I sent her a text on WhatsApp, and we ended up talking all night, like old friends, about everything. It felt so good, better than anything else I had lived in over a year and a half. I suggested grabbing a coffee, as I was about to leave to study in Canada, and she was going to England, but unfortunately the timing was slightly off and we decided to call instead, after following each other back on instagram. We spent about 7 hours on the phone, a whole night. The chemistry was still there, and I let her empty her heart about everything she thought I had ever done wrong, without saying a word to contradict her: I was just happy to be in her presence, and to me she was still the perfect angel who couldn't do no wrong. 

We didn't really talk much after that. I moved to Canada, she went to England (that was like two months ago) and yet, since that call, she's been omnipresent in my thoughts, every stream of consciousness starting and ending with her, her name, her voice, her taste... From her instagram I can see she's doing well, and she probably thinks the same about me: I absolutely cannot afford to let the facade down, there are too many people counting on me and I can't disappoint them by being openly sad or unhappy. But for the last few weeks, I've been crying myself to sleep every night (if I even sleep), contemplating self harm and constantly stalking her on social media, even though I know it's terribly unhealthy. 

I'm pretty sure I still love her, I feel like I'll never be able to fall in love again no matter how hard I try. She haunts every relationship I try to get invested in, I see her in everything and everywhere. I've tried everything to get over her but I'm really starting to get desperate, and I can't help but pray for a miracle to happen and for us to end up together once again, somehow, but the odds of that happening are cosmic. 

I don't even know what I'm trying to accomplish by writing this, but it felt sort of soothing to write it down. ",1,1762851557.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’ve been following this group for a while and thought I’d post this to see if there are any fellow Torontonians interested in doing this with me.

I came across [HoHo Holiday 5K](https://www.hohoholiday5k.com/), which is a walk/run event for charity (Make a Wish Foundation). I plan to walk!

1ou4kdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ou4kdz/no_time_for_other_people_or_myself/,No time for other people or myself.,"I just started working full time as a veterinary assistant recently, but I am also disabled and it feels the amount of doctors appointments I have and tests I need to get done regularly are a part time job within itself. I am struggling with managing my health and work, but I need this so I can save up and be prepared to move in with my boyfriend in the next 1-2 years. 

I think the biggest hurdle for me is the fatigue. I am having trouble sleeping some nights, but then I am now often just coming home from work, taking care of my animals and then going straight to bed, waking up, doing animals, repeat. I only get a 30 minute uninterrupted unpaid break, and often that’s barely enough time for me to go get a coffee and a sandwich and sit down and eat. I don’t even have time to eat dinner before I am asleep, and I don’t have the energy to do things like clean my room, do laundry, even on my off days. I put whatever energy I can into taking care of my pets.

I fell asleep again after work today and missed my friend’s birthday, I meant to give her a call and stuff after work, but I woke up at 2am. I feel terrible. This isn’t the first time I’ve done this to someone and I don’t know what to do to make up for it. She showed up for my birthday when I came to visit (my boyfriend and friends live far away) and I couldn’t even sent a “happy birthday message? I feel like an asshole. I was so tired I figured I could just call later, so I never sent anything. Everyone tried to call me but I slept through my phone going off.

It’s been effecting my relationship, because we are long distance we don’t talk as much anymore. I feel like to be honest it was always me putting in a lot of effort to “be there” and be available when he was free, he is now starting a full time job but before he was part time and always free when I wasn’t. I made time for him, I stayed up late and had nights I didn’t sleep just to talk to him. I often didn’t feel like he appreciated that, he just expected it, when I started falling asleep instead of hanging out with him he started to make comments at me, tell me how I don’t have time for him anymore. It feels unfair in a way but I don’t know. I also am the only one able to go travel to see him, he doesn’t come here for various reasons including the political climate here. I can’t blame him for that, but often I find myself feeling this immense pressure to make everything work and it feels like I’m doing it alone.

I feel like people don’t understand how draining 11+ hour shifts are, even if I’m only working 4 days a week. It’s not uncommon for me to be the sole person cleaning for 3 doctors for the entire day while helping with restraint, running laundry, wrapping surgical supplies, closing by myself etc. because I am the only TA at my practice and we are understaffed often. Some days I have had to managed all that while running appointments. I have asked to be trained to do more desk work, not because I enjoy phone calls but because I physically can’t keep this up, and I am still waiting for that months after asking. I am underpaid and my raise was half of what I expected because corporate said we weren’t making enough money to give me a normal increase. I felt so defeated and it’s really caused me to feel burnt out.

I feel like people didn’t appreciate me before when I was there, and now that I’m not they are upset with me. And in many ways it’s understandable, at the same time I don’t know how to fix this. I feel terrible, I just don’t know how to make anything right. People have told me to quit, go back to part time, etc. It’s not that simple. My parents expect me to go back and finish a degree on top of this, and I agreed to work on it next year, but truthfully I don’t think I can manage it on top of living in a toxic household. They have these crazy expectations of me and then turn around and call me lazy even when I’m doing everything they’ve asked. I used to be the sole person who cleaned our house and because I can’t do that anymore they often pick on me for “never helping out” and having to hire cleaners. I don’t make enough money to live on my own either, so I can’t fix that by just leaving. My medical bills alone I couldn’t afford with my pay.

I don’t know what to do, it feels like everyone is so done with me and who can blame them. I am not there anymore. I don’t hang out anymore, I don’t reach out, I haven’t talked to my best friend in months. I just don’t see another way to manage anything. I was drinking coffee almost every day but neglecting to brush my teeth because I was so tired and got 4 cavities, after having amazing teeth my whole life, it was a huge wake up call so now that I’m not drinking as much caffeine I can’t stay awake. And genuinely I don’t think staying awake and only sleeping 2-4 hours a night was good either. But now that I can’t manage that anymore I know everyone is unhappy with me, and I don’t know what to do.

I can’t stop crying, I just don’t know how to fix it. I feel so unwell all the time, I am constantly in pain. I don’t have time to go visit anyone anymore, I feel so isolated, but I also do love what I do even if it’s breaking me. I don’t know how to make everything work. I have neglected myself so much that my room is a disaster and pretty much all my laundry is dirty.

I don’t know what to do I just needed to get that out, I don’t see a solution until I can actually move out where everyone is. I am trying to manage my health but I haven’t gotten anywhere. I’ve done so much including surgery to try to get better, so far nothing is working, I have to start fresh with more new specialists and it feels like I’m drowning in everything I have to sort out.",1,1762851291.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

I'm reaching out because I'm having trouble with my DeLonghi Rivelia coffee machine, specifically with the Hot Milk carafe attachment. The carafe is no longer drawing milk; it doesn't work even when I try with water instead of milk, so it seems like the issue isn't with the liquid itself.

Here’s what I’ve already tried:

* Thoroughly cleaned the milk carafe
* Performed regular cleaning and maintenance cycles on the machine
* Double-checked all connections and assembly

Despite all this, the problem still occurs exactly as shown in my video (link below).

Has anyone experienced this issue or have any suggestions? I'm unsure whether it's a malfunction with the carafe mechanism or something else inside the machine. Any troubleshooting advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

1ou4bx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1ou4bx5/the_whispering_humidifier/,The Whispering Humidifier,"The hospital room was quiet except for the faint hiss of the humidifier in the corner.  
I’d been awake for two nights straight, watching my father’s chest rise and fall through the oxygen mask. The nurses said he was “stable,” but the word felt meaningless when every beep from the monitor made my heart stop.

That’s when I heard it.

A whisper. Soft, wet, like the hum of the machine had turned into a voice.  
“Breathe in,” it said. “Breathe out.”

I froze.  
At first, I thought it was exhaustion—hallucinations from too much coffee and fluorescent light. But then my father stirred. His eyes fluttered beneath his lids, and his chest expanded, fuller than before.

The humidifier hissed again.  
“Breathe in. Breathe out.”

My pulse raced. I checked the machine—it was just a basic model, old, yellowed from use. No smart functions, no speakers. Just a steady stream of vapor curling into the dim air.

When I stepped closer, the whisper grew clearer.  
“He’s not ready,” it murmured. “Keep him warm. Keep him close.”

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over the IV line. The sound seemed to follow, as if the mist itself was speaking directly into my ear. The monitor beeped faster, and my father gasped—a horrible, shallow sound. I shouted for help.

Nurses rushed in. They adjusted tubes, pressed buttons, muttered to each other. The whispering stopped. The hiss went silent.  
And for a second, so did my father.

Flatline.

I felt my knees go weak. But before I could scream, the humidifier sputtered and came back to life—releasing a thick, warm plume that spread across the room like breath. The vapor touched my father’s face, and the monitor blipped once. Then again. Then steadied.

The nurses froze.

“He’s… stabilizing,” one said, wide-eyed.

They left soon after, whispering about faulty readings. I stayed. My father slept peacefully, his breathing deep and calm.  
And then the whisper returned. Fainter this time. Kinder.

“Not all air is empty,” it said. “Some of us stay to help you breathe.”

I stared at the machine, at the little red light pulsing in rhythm with his heartbeat. The mist drifted toward me, and for a moment, I thought I saw something—faces in the vapor. Smiling. Familiar. My mother’s, maybe. My grandmother’s. All the people we’d lost.

The whisper softened to a sigh.  
“You breathe because we do.”

By morning, my father was awake, alert, even joking with the nurse. The doctors called it “a miracle recovery.”  
But I knew better.

When I unplugged the humidifier to take it home, the vapor curled one last time into the shape of a hand waving goodbye. I didn’t feel scared anymore—just… light. Like the air around me was full of quiet, gentle lungs helping us all keep going.

Now, every night, I keep it by my bed.

It still whispers:  
“Breathe in. Breathe out.”",4,1762850335.0,shortscarystories,0,0.84,False

The pressure is on to find a gift that’s thoughtful, clever, and most importantly, *not* another generic mug.

Fear not, festive friend. This is the only **secret santa ideas** list you'll need. We’ve scoured the internet, consulted office elves, and brainstormed until our brains smelled like candy canes to bring you a guide packed with gifts that are actually good.

Forget the last-minute gas station gift card. We're breaking down the best **secret santa gifts** by personality, budget, and vibe.

## **Step 1: The 5-Minute Recon Mission (Do This First!)**

Before you even look at a single gift idea, become a holiday detective for a day. The best gift isn't random; it's targeted.

*   **Eavesdrop (Respectfully!):** What are they talking about? Hobbies? A favorite TV show? A coffee obsession? Complaining about cold hands? That's gold.
*   **Scan Their Desk:** This is a treasure trove of clues. Do they have photos of a dog? Plants? A collection of Funko Pops? A specific brand of tea?
*   **Check Public Social Media:** A quick, non-creepy glance at a LinkedIn or public Instagram profile can reveal passions for hiking, cooking, video games, or a favorite sports team.

A little observation goes a long way in turning a generic gift into a ""Wow, how did you know?!"" moment.

## **Hilarious Secret Santa Gifts (For the Office Clown)**

These gifts are for the person who's always ready with a joke and loves a good laugh. The key here is funny, not offensive.

*   **Custom Socks with Their Pet's Face on Them:** Unbelievably popular and always a hit. You just need a quick photo from their desk or social media.
*   **A ""Marketing Harassment"" Mug or Similar Job-Specific Humor:** Find a funny mug that relates to their profession.
*   **A Burrito Blanket:** It’s a blanket that looks like a giant tortilla. Why? Because being a human burrito is peak comfort.
*   **Desktop Punching Bag:** For those stressful days. It's silly but surprisingly cathartic.
*   **""Emergency"" Survival Kit:** Fill a box with funny, low-cost items like high-caffeine tea, a tiny bottle of hot sauce, a ""find your chill"" coloring book, and a single-serving of instant ramen.
*   **A ""World's Okayest Coworker"" Trophy:** A classic for a reason.

## **Thoughtful & Cozy Gifts (For the Person Who Deserves a Spa Day)**

This is for the coworker who is always calm, kind, and probably has their life way more together than you do. Think comfort and self-care.

*   **High-Quality Candle:** Skip the cheap stuff. Go for a soy wax candle with a sophisticated scent like sandalwood, fig, or citrus. Brands like Homesick or P.F. Candle Co. are excellent.
*   **A Nice Hand Cream:** Office air is dry! A luxurious, non-greasy hand cream (like L'Occitane or Aveda) is a godsend.
*   **Gourmet Coffee or Tea Sampler:** If they live at the Keurig, a bag of locally roasted coffee beans or a fancy tea sampler will be deeply appreciated.

## **DIY & Budget-Friendly Secret Santa Ideas (Under $15)**

Who says a great gift has to be expensive? These are perfect for when the price limit is tight or if you want to add a personal touch.

*   **Baked Goods:** A tin of homemade cookies or a loaf of festive bread is a classic for a reason. Just include a ingredients list for allergies!
*   **A Curated ""Cocktail in a Jar"":** Layer the ingredients for a hot toddy, mulled cider spice mix, or a signature cocktail in a mason jar with a recipe tag.
*   **A Custom Spotify Playlist:** Create a playlist based on what you know of their taste (or what you think they'd like). Make it collaborative so others can add songs. Share the link with a festive card.
*   **A Hot Sauce or Fancy Salt Sampler:** If they're a foodie, a small collection of unique hot sauces or finishing salts (like smoked salt or truffle salt) is a fantastic and inexpensive gift.
*   **A Knitted Scarf or Hat:** If you're crafty, this is the ultimate personal gift.
*   **Gourmet Hot Chocolate Kit:** A nice mug filled with high-quality hot chocolate mix, mini marshmallows, and maybe some peppermint sticks.

## **Pro-Tips for a Flawless Secret Santa Exchange**

*   **Use a Secret Santa Generator:** Avoid awkwardness by using a free online tool like Elfster or DrawNames. It lets people add wish lists and anonymously ask questions, which is a game-changer.
*   **Stick to the Budget:** The price limit is there for a reason. Don't be the person who shows everyone up with an $80 gift when the limit was $25.
*   **The Presentation Matters:** You don't need fancy wrapping paper, but a neat presentation shows you care. A simple gift bag with some tissue paper or a well-wrapped box makes a huge difference.
*   **What If You Get Your Boss?** Keep it professional and classy. A nice bottle of wine (if appropriate), a gourmet food item, or a gift basket for their team to share are all safe bets.
*   **What If You Get Someone You Don't Know?** This is where the practical gifts shine. A portable charger, a nice candle, a gourmet coffee sampler, or a gift card to a local coffee shop are universally appreciated and nearly impossible to mess up.

There you have it! With this list, you're officially equipped to conquer **Secret Santa** and become the office gift-giving champion.

1ou4ak5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ou4ak5,Which directors’ styles do you instantly recognize or love the most?,"We hardly ever talk about directors in K-drama threads — it’s usually actors, OSTs, or visuals. But directors are the unsung architects of a show’s tone: their vision shapes the pacing, the silences, the emotional beats, and how a script actually lands on screen. I wanted to make a post just for them — the people whose direction makes a scene stay with you.

A few directors I love:

Shin Won-ho (Reply series, Prison Playbook, Hospital Playlist, resident playbook)— has such a distinct style. His combo with writer Lee Woo-jung  is unmatched — her grounded storytelling comes alive through his subtle, emotionally rich direction. They just understand each other’s rhythm perfectly. Their works feel so heartwarming, nostalgic, with very simple storyline with intrigued dialogues. 

Kim Won-seok (Misaeng, Signal, My Mister, Arthdal Chronicles, When Life Gives You Tangerines) — his work can be heartbreakingly truthful. He doesn’t shy away from the harsher parts of life, and his style gives even ordinary moments a huge emotional weight.

Ahn Pan-seok (Something in the Rain, One Spring Night, Secret love Affair, Midnight Romance in Hagwon) — his projects feel cozy and intimate, like a slow, rainy afternoon with a warm cup of coffee. He often chooses morally complex stories and shows intimacy in ways that feel natural, not sensationalized. I know many people complain about his choice of ost as it is heavily overused, it didn't bothered me much when i watched it, infact i loved it. He sometimes uses jazzy, more romantic osts that just fit the whole vibe of the show and add more immersion and depth to the story.

Special mention- Han Jun-hee (D.P., Weak Hero) — I loved the grit and energy in these shows; his style is punchy and modern, and he brings a different, harder edge compared to the slice-of-life directors above.


I mostly focus on slice-of-life and character-driven dramas, so these are my go-to directors — but there are so many more worth mentioning across genres.

Who are the K-drama directors whose work you always follow? Which directors’ names on a project make you click “watch” without hesitation?",15,1762850185.0,kdramas,3,1.0,False

I live in a country where cars are prohibitively expensive, therefore an ""entry level"" sports car like the 86/brz can only be a pipe dream for an average salaried worker like me. This summer, I took a vacation to Japan and managed to live that dream for 2 days. Perhaps someone will recognize that this car is from Omoshiro Rental, haha. I took a spirited drive up the Hakone Turnpike (yeah, predictable) and hit some of the lakes around Mt Fuji. My glasses are rose-tinted af, but what a dream come true, what a fun time.
I last drove a manual trans car 9 years ago, so unfortunately in those 2 days I still had trouble getting used to the biting point and clutch travel.
I've only ever driven economy cars, so a ""spirited drive"" for me is probably a cars-&-coffee drive for most here. It's the most powerful car I've driven in my life, so I have no gripes in the power department. Steering on my daily driver Mazda 6 feels ""heavier"", but there is a nimbleness or agility that is evident in how the gr86 moves.
I. Can't. Stop. Turning. Back. To. Look. At. It. Front, back, all angles look good.
I couldn't fit a 30inch luggage into the trunk without dropping the rear seats, so my wife had a great time ribbing me about the impracticality of this car. I once tried to convince her that this could be a family friendly car when our kids are still small, lol.

1ou49y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BGMStock/comments/1ou49y7/warren_buffett_just_sent_what_could_be_his_last/,WARREN BUFFETT JUST SENT WHAT COULD BE HIS LAST MESSAGE TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY $BRK.B SHAREHOLDERS AS CEO OF THE COMPANY,"Here is the full and entire 8 page press release Warren Buffett just released   
  
To My Fellow Shareholders:    
  
I will no longer be writing Berkshire’s annual report or talking endlessly at the annual meeting. As the British would say, I’m “going quiet.”   
  
Sort of.   
  
Greg Abel will become the boss at yearend. He is a great manager, a tireless worker and an honest communicator. Wish him an extended tenure.   
  
I will continue talking to you and my children about Berkshire via my annual Thanksgiving message. Berkshire’s individual shareholders are a very special group who are unusually generous in sharing their gains with others less fortunate. I enjoy the chance to keep in touch with you. Indulge me this year as I first reminisce a bit. After that, I will discuss the plans for distribution of my Berkshire shares. Finally, I will offer a few business and personal observations.   
  
\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*   
  
As Thanksgiving approaches, I’m grateful and surprised by my luck in being alive at 95. When I was young, this outcome did not look like a good bet. Early on, I nearly died.    
  
It was 1938 and Omaha hospitals were then thought of by its citizens as either Catholic or Protestant, a classification that seemed natural at the time.    
  
Our family doctor, Harley Hotz, was a friendly Catholic who made house calls toting a black bag. Dr. Hotz called me Skipper and never charged much for his visits. When I experienced a bad bellyache in 1938, Dr. Hotz came by and, after probing a bit, told me I would be OK in the morning.     
  
He then went home, had dinner and played a little bridge. Dr. Hotz couldn’t, however, get my somewhat peculiar symptoms out of his mind and later that night he dispatched me to St. Catherine’s Hospital for an emergency appendectomy. During the next three weeks, I felt like I was in a nunnery, and began enjoying my new “podium.” I liked to talk – yes, even then – and the nuns embraced me.   
  
To top things off, Miss Madsen, my third-grade teacher, told my 30 classmates to each write me a letter. I probably threw away the letters from the boys but read and reread those from the girls; hospitalization had its rewards.    
  
The highlight of my recovery – which actually was dicey for much of the first week – was a gift from my wonderful Aunt Edie. She brought me a very professional-looking fingerprinting set, and I promptly fingerprinted all of my attending nuns. (I was probably the first Protestant kid they had seen at St. Catherine’s and they didn’t know what to expect.)   
  
My theory – totally nutty, of course – was that someday a nun would go bad and the FBI would find that they had neglected to fingerprint nuns. The FBI and its director, J. Edgar Hoover, had become revered by Americans in the 1930s, and I envisioned Mr. Hoover, himself, coming to Omaha to inspect my invaluable collection. I further fantasized that J. Edgar and I would quickly identify and apprehend the wayward nun. National fame seemed certain.   
  
Obviously, my fantasy never materialized. But, ironically, some years later it became clear that I should have fingerprinted J. Edgar himself as he became disgraced for misusing his post.    
  
Well, that was Omaha in the 1930s, when a sled, a bicycle, a baseball glove and an electric train were coveted by me and my friends. Let’s look at a few other kids from that era, who grew up very nearby and greatly influenced my life but of whom I was for long unaware.   
  
I’ll begin with Charlie Munger, my best pal for 64 years. In the 1930s, Charlie lived a block away from the house I have owned and occupied since 1958.   
  
Early on, I missed befriending Charlie by a whisker. Charlie, 6 ⅔ years older than I, worked in the summer of 1940 at my grandfather’s grocery store, earning $2 for a 10-hour day. (Thrift runs deep in Buffett blood.) The following year I did similar work at the store, but I never met Charlie until 1959 when he was 35 and I was 28.   
  
After serving in World War II, Charlie graduated from Harvard Law and then moved permanently to California. Charlie, however, forever talked of his early years in Omaha as formative. For more than 60 years, Charlie had a huge impact on me and could not have been a better teacher and protective “big brother.” We had differences but never had an argument. “I told you so” was not in his vocabulary.   
  
In 1958, I bought my first and only home. Of course, it was in Omaha, located about two miles from where I grew up (loosely defined), less than two blocks from my in-laws, about six blocks from the Buffett grocery store and a 6-7-minute drive from the office building where I have worked for 64 years.     
  
Let’s move on to another Omahan, Stan Lipsey. Stan sold the Omaha Sun Newspapers (weeklies) to Berkshire in 1968 and a decade later moved to Buffalo at my request. The Buffalo Evening News, owned by a Berkshire affiliate, was then locked in a battle to the death with its morning competitor who published Buffalo’s only Sunday paper. And we were losing.   
  
Stan eventually built our new Sunday product, and for some years our paper – formerly hemorrhaging cash – earned over 100% annually (pre-tax) on our $33 million investment. This was important money to Berkshire in the early 1980s.   
  
Stan grew up about five blocks from my home. One of Stan’s neighbors was Walter Scott, Jr. Walter, you will remember, brought MidAmerican Energy to Berkshire in 1999. He was also a valued Berkshire director until his death in 2021 and a very close friend. Walter was Nebraska’s philanthropic leader for decades and both Omaha and the state carries his imprint.   
  
Walter attended Benson High School, which I was scheduled to attend as well – until my dad surprised everyone in 1942 by beating a four-term incumbent in a Congressional race. Life is full of surprises.   
  
Wait, there’s more.   
  
In 1959, Don Keough and his young family lived in a home located directly across the street from my house and about 100 yards away from where the Munger family had lived. Don was then a coffee salesman but was destined to become president of Coca-Cola as well as a devoted director of Berkshire.   
  
When I met Don, he was earning $12,000 a year while he and his wife Mickie were raising five children, all destined for Catholic schools (with tuition requirements).   
  
Our families became fast friends. Don came from a farm in northwest Iowa and graduated from Omaha’s Creighton University. Early on, he married Mickie, an Omaha girl. After joining Coke, Don went on to become legendary around the globe.   
  
In 1985, when Don was president of Coke, the company launched its ill-fated New Coke. Don made a famous speech in which he apologized to the public and reinstated “Old” Coke. This change of heart took place after Don explained that Coke incoming mail addressed to “Supreme Idiot” was promptly delivered to his desk. His “withdrawal” speech is a classic and can be viewed on YouTube. He cheerfully acknowledged that, in truth, the Coca-Cola product belonged to the public and not to the company. Sales subsequently soared.   
  
You can watch Don on CharlieRose(.)com in a wonderful interview. (Tom Murphy and Kay Graham have a couple of gems as well.) Like Charlie Munger, Don forever remained a Midwestern boy, enthusiastic, friendly and American to the core.   
  
Finally, Ajit Jain, born and raised in India, as well as Greg Abel, our Canadian CEO-to-be, each lived in Omaha for several years late in the 20th Century. Indeed, in the 1990s, Greg lived only a few blocks away from me on Farnam Street, though we never met at the time.  
  
Can it be that there is some magic ingredient in Omaha’s water?  
  
\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*    
  
I lived a few teenage years in Washington, DC (when my dad was in Congress) and in 1954 I took what I thought would be a permanent job in Manhattan. There I was treated wonderfully by Ben Graham and Jerry Newman and made many life-long friends. New York had unique assets – and still does. Nevertheless, in 1956, after only 1½ years, I returned to Omaha, never to wander again.  
  
Subsequently, my three children, as well as several grandchildren, were raised in Omaha. My children always attended public schools (graduating from the same high school that educated my dad (class of 1921), my first wife, Susie (class of 1950) as well as Charlie, Stan Lipsey, Irv and Ron Blumkin, who were key to growing Nebraska Furniture Mart, and Jack Ringwalt (class of 1923), who founded National Indemnity and sold it to Berkshire in 1967 where it became the base upon which our huge P/C operation was constructed.   
  
\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*   
  
 Our country has many great companies, great schools, great medical facilities and each definitely has its own special advantages along with talented people. But I feel very lucky to have had the good fortune to make many lifelong friends, to meet both of my wives, to receive a great start in education at public schools, to meet many interesting and friendly adult Omahans when I was very young, and to make a wide variety of friends in the Nebraska National Guard. In short, Nebraska has been home.   
  
Looking back I feel that both Berkshire and I did better because of our base in Omaha than if I had resided anywhere else. The center of the United States was a very good place to be born, to raise a family, and to build a business. Through dumb luck, I drew a ridiculously long straw at birth.   
  
\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*    
  
Now let’s move on to my advanced age. My genes haven’t been particularly helpful – the family’s all-time record for longevity (admittedly family records get fuzzy as you work backwards) was 92 until I came along. But I have had wise, friendly and dedicated Omaha doctors, starting with Harley Hotz, and continuing to this day. At least three times, my life has been saved, each with doctors based within a few miles from my home. (I have given up fingerprinting nurses, however. You can get away with many eccentricities at 95 . . . . . but there are limits.)   
  
\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*   
  
Those who reach old age need a huge dose of good luck, daily escaping banana peels, natural disasters, drunk or distracted drivers, lightning strikes, you name it.    
  
But Lady Luck is fickle and – no other term fits – wildly unfair. In many cases, our leaders and the rich have received far more than their share of luck – which, too often, the recipients prefer not to acknowledge. Dynastic inheritors have achieved lifetime financial independence the moment they emerged from the womb, while others have arrived, facing a hell-hole during their early life or, worse, disabling physical or mental infirmities that rob them of what I have taken for granted. In many heavily-populated parts of the world, I would likely have had a miserable life and my sisters would have had one even worse.   
  
I was born in 1930 healthy, reasonably intelligent, white, male and in America. Wow! Thank you, Lady Luck. My sisters had equal intelligence and better personalities than I but faced a much different outlook. Lady Luck continued to drop by during much of my life, but she has better things to do than work with those in their 90s. Luck has its limits.  
  
Father Time, to the contrary, now finds me more interesting as I age. And he is undefeated; for him, everyone ends up on his score card as “wins.” When balance, sight, hearing and memory are all on a persistently downward slope, you know Father Time is in the neighborhood.  
  
I was late in becoming old – its onset materially varies – but once it appears, it is not to be  
denied.  
  
To my surprise, I generally feel good. Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people. Occasionally, I get a useful idea or am approached with an offer we might not otherwise have received. Because of Berkshire’s size and because of market levels, ideas are few – but not zero.  
  
\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*  
My unexpected longevity, however, has unavoidable consequences of major importance to my family and the achievement of my charitable objectives.  
  
Let’s explore them.  
  
What Comes Next  
  
My children are all above normal retirement age, having reached 72, 70 and 67. It would be a mistake to wager that all three – now at their peak in many respects – will enjoy my exceptional luck in delayed aging. To improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them, I need to step up the pace of lifetime gifts to their three foundations. My children are now at their prime in respect to experience and wisdom but have  
yet to enter old age. That “honeymoon” period will not last forever.  
  
Fortunately, a course correction is easy to execute. There is, however, one additional factor to consider: I would like to keep a significant amount of “A” shares until Berkshire shareholders develop the comfort with Greg that Charlie and I long enjoyed. That level of confidence shouldn’t take long. My children are already 100% behind Greg as are the Berkshire directors.  
  
All three children now have the maturity, brains, energy and instincts to disburse a large fortune. They will also have the advantage of being above ground when I am long gone and, if necessary, can adopt policies both anticipatory and reactive to federal tax policies or other developments affecting philanthropy. They may well need to adapt to a significantly changing world around them. Ruling from the grave does not have a great record, and I have never had an urge to do  
  
Fortunately, all three children received a dominant dosage of their genes from their mother. As the decades have passed, I have also become a better model for their thinking and behavior. I will never, however, achieve parity with their mother.  
  
My children have three alternate trustees in case of any premature deaths or disabilities. The alternates are not ranked or tied to a specific child. All three are exceptional humans and wise in the ways of the world. They have no conflicting motives.  
  
I have assured my children that they do not need to perform miracles nor fear failures or disappointments. These are inevitable, and I have made my share. They simply need to improve somewhat upon what generally is achieved by government activities and/or private philanthropy, recognizing these other methods of redistribution of wealth have shortcomings as well.  
  
Early on, I contemplated various grand philanthropic plans. Though I was stubborn, these did not prove feasible. During my many years, I’ve also watched ill-conceived wealth transfers by political hacks, dynastic choices and, yes, inept or quirky philanthropists.  
  
If my children simply do a decent job, they can be certain that their mother and I would be pleased. Their instincts are good and they each have had years of practice with very small sums initially that have been irregularly increased to more than $500 million annually.  
  
All three like working long hours to help others, each in their own way.  
  
\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*  
  
The acceleration of my lifetime gifts to my children’s foundations in no way reflects any change in my views about Berkshire’s prospects. Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire’s next CEO. He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don’t even consider. I can’t think of a CEO, a management consultant, an academic, a member of government – you name it – that I would select over Greg to handle your savings and mine.  
  
Greg understands, for example, far more about both the upside potential and the dangers of our P/C insurance business than do a great many long-time P/C executives. My hope is that his health remains good for several decades. With a little luck, Berkshire should require only five or six CEOs over the next century. It should particularly avoid those whose goal is to retire at 65, to become lookat-me rich or to initiate a dynasty  
  
One unpleasant reality: Occasionally, a wonderful and loyal CEO of the parent or a subsidiary will succumb to dementia, Alzheimer’s or another debilitating and long-term disease.  
  
Charlie and I encountered this problem several times and failed to act. This failure can be a huge mistake. The Board must be alert to this possibility at the CEO level and the CEO must be alert to the possibility at subsidiaries. This is easier said than done; I could cite a few examples from the past at major companies. Directors should be alert and speak up is all that I can advise.  
  
During my lifetime, reformers sought to embarrass CEOs by requiring the disclosure of the compensation of the boss compared to what was being paid to the average employee. Proxy statements promptly ballooned to 100-plus pages compared to 20 or less earlier.  
  
But the good intentions didn’t work; instead they backfired. Based on the majority of my observations – the CEO of company “A” looked at his competitor at company “B” and subtly conveyed to his board that he should be worth more. Of course, he also boosted the pay of directors and was careful who he placed on the compensation committee. The new rules produced envy, not moderation.  
  
The ratcheting took on a life of its own. What often bothers very wealthy CEOs – they are human, after all – is that other CEOs are getting even richer. Envy and greed walk hand in hand. And what consultant ever recommended a serious cut in CEO compensation or board payments?   
  
\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*  
  
In aggregate, Berkshire’s businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems. However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll.  
  
Berkshire has less chance of a devastating disaster than any business I know. And, Berkshire has a more shareholder-conscious management and board than almost any company with which I am familiar (and I’ve seen a lot). Finally, Berkshire will always be managed in a manner that will make its existence an asset to the United States and eschew activities that would lead it to become a supplicant. Over time, our managers should grow quite wealthy – they have important responsibilities – but do not have the desire for dynastic or look-at-me wealth.  
  
Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management. Don’t despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.   
  
**A Few Final Thoughts**   
  
One perhaps self-serving observation. I’m happy to say I feel better about the second half of my life than the first. My advice: Don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes – learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve. Get the right heroes and copy them. You can start with Tom Murphy; he was the best.  
  
Remember Alfred Nobel, later of Nobel Prize fame, who – reportedly – read his own obituary that was mistakenly printed when his brother died and a newspaper got mixed up. He was horrified at what he read and realized he should change his behavior.  
  
Don’t count on a newsroom mix-up: Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it.  
  
Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government. When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless. Whether you are religious or not, it’s hard to beat The Golden Rule as a guide to behavior.  
  
I write this as one who has been thoughtless countless times and made many mistakes but also became very lucky in learning from some wonderful friends how to behave better (still a long way from perfect, however). Keep in mind that the cleaning lady is as much a human being as the Chairman.  
  
 \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*    
  
I wish all who read this a very happy Thanksgiving. Yes, even the jerks; it’s never too late to change. Remember to thank America for maximizing your opportunities. But it is – inevitably – capricious and sometimes venal in distributing its rewards.  
  
Choose your heroes very carefully and then emulate them. You will never be perfect, but you can always be better.",1,1762850119.0,BGMStock,0,1.0,False

Nakakasama ng loob na sila pa mismo yung nagsasabi ng ganon harap harapan ko pa with people, mostly, hindi ko kilala. Nakakababa ng self esteem. 

I stopped taking pills, hoping na sana mabawasan/makatulong in losing weight. Kaso parang mas lalo akong nag-gain ng weight. Hindi kona rin alam bakit, I have been eating healthier meals - less rice, more ulam, nabawasan na pag-iinom ko ng liquid calories (soda, juice) to the point na hindi na talaga ako umiinom na, black coffee w/ stevia nalang iniinom ko and lots of water. Tapos makikita ko nag gain lang ako lalo ng weight - never expected na aabot ako ng 70s kg (pre PCOS around 50s, then PCOS around 60s). Nagising na ako sa katotohanan na I'll never get to be the ""attractive"" me. Galit na galit na ako. Ayoko na.

10-15 minutes elliptical, then 2 reps w 10 sets deadlift muna (home workout) plus other house chores involving working outside. Sana maituloy tuloy ko.

But before packing your bags, it’s important to understand what your wallet is in for. The good news? Both Germany and Poland offer a range of affordable options, depending on your lifestyle and preferences.

One of the most noticeable differences is in housing costs. In Poland, especially in cities like Kraków and Wrocław, renting an apartment is often significantly cheaper than in Germany’s major urban centers like Berlin or Munich. If you’re someone who doesn’t mind a slightly smaller city, Poland gives you great value for money. On the other hand, Germany offers a wide range of housing options and is known for its excellent infrastructure, so even if you’re spending a bit more, you’re often getting high quality in return.

When it comes to groceries and daily essentials, Poland tends to come out ahead in terms of affordability. Fresh produce, meat, dairy, and bakery items are generally cheaper. Germany, however, shines with its high standards in food safety and variety—perfect for those who appreciate a broad selection of goods and international cuisine. Eating out follows a similar pattern. In Poland, dining at local restaurants or grabbing a coffee is usually more budget-friendly. Germany offers fantastic dining options too, though you might spend a little more, especially in larger cities.

Public transportation is another win for expats in both countries. Germany boasts one of the most efficient and punctual transport systems in Europe, which is great for those who rely on trains and buses daily. Poland’s public transit is also reliable and very affordable, especially in student-friendly cities where discounts are common.

[Price comparison](https://compare.nedostavka.net/en/germany-and-poland-price-comparison-of-products-and-goods-de-pl) between Germany and Poland highlights a few key things—Poland is generally more budget-friendly for everyday living, while Germany balances higher costs with quality services and infrastructure. Both countries provide excellent opportunities for expats, whether you're working remotely, starting a business, or exploring career options abroad.

Ultimately, whether you choose the modern charm of Germany or the historic heart of Poland, both offer great lifestyles at reasonable prices. You just need to match your priorities—whether it’s saving money, accessing top-notch services, or a mix of both.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I’m hoping to meet some new people to hang out with or just chat; most of my close friends have moved away or are busy with adult life.

I’m a 32yo Latino, work in tech, pretty easygoing and a good listener. I enjoy slow mornings with coffee, walking around the seawall, going to the aquarium, and staying active (as most as I can). I’ve been getting more into exercise lately and trying to build a healthier routine.

Some of my hobbies/interests (I’m not an expert on any of these and maybe you can teach me or we can learn together):

Photography: I have a Canon camera and love taking pictures, but I’d still call myself a beginner.
Running: Not the fastest runner, but I can manage a 5K with some effort. Would love to signup for a run at some point.

Swimming/Freediving: I like to swim and I used to  practice freediving although I haven’t found a place to practice it.

Music: I play electric guitar (a bit rusty now) and have a wide taste; Latin, alt rock, pop, blues, math rock, etc. I tend to appreciate music for its structure more than lyrics. I also like to go to concerts and would be nice to find someone to go with.

Video games & learning: I play occasionally and enjoy learning new skills/hobbies.

I’d love to meet people who share similar values and interests, ideally within the same age group (25–35) If any of this sounds like you, feel free to send a DM, always up for making new friends!

Edit: I also like to try new restaurants from time to time
