Giving a talk this morning to a large audience of peers. Woke up with slightly high levels which is to be expected whenever I'm anxious. Bolus for my breakfast and my pump makes the necessary adjustments.

I then make the biggest mistake of my morning - I shower.

Levels plummet.  I'm talking two arrows down plummeting. Surely it's going to rise soon, right? I have a coffee with a couple of sugars just in case and get to the office.

I say hello to a few colleagues and realise it's going very wrong because I'm struggling to pronounce vowels (which  is my own little peculiaritity when things go wrong - I'm sure we all have ours)

I'm about 20 minutes away from my talk. I panic and eat half a pack of jelly babies, have a can of coke AND a mars bar (I had a two hour talk ahead of me and I wasn't thinking straight). My vowels creep back in.

I deliver my talk. In the last hour this is accompanied by my phone beeping and my pump loudly vibrating. But I'm looking everyone straight in the eye and talking about the evolving pedagogical needs of students (or pdggcl nds which is probably what it sounded like ).

Just got back to my office and I'm completely drained. Levels are at 19.2 and rising. Thought the best thing to do was to jump on Reddit and share this with those who'd empathise rather than just sympathise.

Type 1, eh :( ?

1j37jwg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j37jwg,What layout for my living room?,"Heyo everyone. I've been struggling with coming up with a layout for my living room. This is what I've ended up with right now, though I don't think it's optimal. The room is about 5,5 by 4,2 meters big.

The biggest hurdle for me is that 3 out of 4 walls have doors / windows and I have a projector which I would like to project on a wall (ideally from a shelf from an opposite wall, so it makes a big screen - though not opposing to other ideas). Also the couch might be a bit too big for the room, though I cannot change that. (The coffee table is not in the photos yet, as it is on the way right now.) Feel free to propose any solutions, new pieces of furniture or anything. I will also be buying a rug at some point, to divide the space a bit between the dining and living area.

I'll be grateful for any ideas on how to make better use of the space. Thanks everyone!",1,1741082908.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

Ideally I'd like it to be able to dispense enough for a standard mug (about 250ml including a bit of milk).

I had tried the AEG machine they made to take Lavazza pods but that would only do a max of 100ml and that had issues with the pump struggling to get water through the pod and it would mostly end up in the pod collector so maybe not another Lavazza machine.

Typically my coffees are flat white although I did like the milk frother option on both Lavazza machines so having the option of a latte/cappucino would be good.",1,1741082896.0,AskUK,1,1.0,False

Are they legit? I couldn't find a whole lot of experiences with the brand in this sub or the r/coffee sub and I was wondering if people here know about the brand and whether or not this scale would be a good investment. Bonus points for reviews on the scale.

My girlfriend and I are traveling from Hungary to Aarhus this weekend (7-10 March) to check out if the city would be right for us if we choose to attend university there. We both applied to MSc programmes here and in G√∂teborg, Sweden, and we want to find out which city/university to choose if we have the option.

For further context, I'm interested in the CompSci MSc, and my gf is primarily interested in the Heritage Management or the Intercultural Studies programme.

Do you have any recommendations for us to check out especially relevant for students? E.g. caf√©s frequented by students, student bars etc.

Also, is there anyone here who'd be down to have a coffee/tea/beer with us this weekend, and tell us about their experience studying in Aarhus? We can offer some Hungarian sweets in return! üç´",2,1741082801.0,Aarhus_University,0,1.0,False

You aren‚Äôt going against it in less than a few hours 
Keep to what you say
If you don‚Äôt think you can don‚Äôt make the promise or say you will , say you want to. 
Onyx is not mad at you 
Kit is not mad at you she is hurt 
She doesn‚Äôt blame me 
I took the crooked man off because I want to keep that to myself 
It‚Äôs my favorite 
It‚Äôs my hobby
I need to have my own things
My name is Emercy and that is okay
Change is okay
It‚Äôs scary but it‚Äôs not going to kill you 
I promise you will be okay
I love you 
She loves you too 
My attachment style is anxious preoccupied 
I crave closeness with a high fear of abandonment 
Affirmations of love 
I seek reassurance from you the most because you are the most I‚Äôm scared to lose and it makes perfect sense when I put it that way. 
Work on self esteem 
Create healthy boundaries 
May exhibit jealousy or possessiveness 
That really does sound like me huh?
I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt take the time to understand that
Self care and proper communication will help with this attachment style
Have patience with myself and with you 
I can validate myself but hearing positive thoughts you think about me sometimes helps 
The attention I get being inconsistent/ changing can make it hard to regulate 
I‚Äôm used to Wednesdays
That changing in anyway messes me up to the point I lash out on anybody 
I know why now 
I‚Äôm used to the 19th
That changes and my world stops functioning 
I understand now why. 
Treat my codependency 
Space is healthy
Self soothe is healthy 
Compliments help
Practice my mind full skills more 
Before I make a decision, react, or have an action think before I do it.
Focus on what‚Äôs going on with my head and body 
Practice asking for space when I need to
I was doing this 
I just got afraid and stopped 
I did this I was afraid she was upset at me for needing space 
I realize that is a unrealistic thought 
Limit how much you help others over yourself 
Communicate my feelings but in a healthy calm way
I also have a fear of being lied to, betrayed 
That‚Äôs from my attachment style
I understand I need to feel safe in my relationship not by something they do but by self validation 
Inconsistent communication is a trigger for my attachment 
The expectation of goodnight /good morning texts 
Not telling me plans when you usually do
Delayed communication when I‚Äôm used to you responding quickly may be taken as rejection 
Perceived rejection 
We knew this is a trigger
Didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs also an attachment style trigger 
lack of reassurance is also a trigger 
Validation will help
Constant conflict and arguments make me feel like this may be the end of our relationship 
Comparing me to another past partner or current partner makes me question my self worth 
I also have to be careful 
Because I may also perceive comparisons when they aren‚Äôt there. ‚ÄúIf I can do it you can‚Äù I hear Niamh saying that all the time in my head. 
I think also feeling like you were comparing what you could do to your brain and I wasn‚Äôt able to quickly messed with me too
Let me put that better 
I feel like when you told me you put in the work and stuff my brain perceived that as comparison and I was doing wrong.
partners who are emotionally unavailable are not for my attachment style at all. 
Situations where the relationship is undefined can make me feel like my relationship isn‚Äôt safe 
‚ÄòNo label‚Äô 
I think I‚Äôm understanding why that hurt me so bad when you or Niamh wanted it 
When the relationship is unclear I am unclear on what I am allowed and not allowed. I am unclear on if I am loved. The no label is the same as a lack of commitment in my brain. 
I crave connections with my partner 
It‚Äôs overwhelming when I don‚Äôt feel connected to my partner
balence between opening up and potential harm is hard 
Opening up may trigger fear of abandonment more 
Building trust with one another and connecting helps
Consistent feelings of trust and safety 
That‚Äôs a need
I have needs
I just have to find them. 
Focus on our moments of joy instead of fights
This will help regulate those unloved unwanted thoughts 
I loved when we watched Lucy together
I love sharing my favorite things with you 
But I do need my own things too 
Learning that balance 
I think finding some support group ish servers will benefit me 
Connecting with others who understand how I feel is another way of validation 
Self reflection needs to be done more‚Äù

1j37if7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoGamingLounge/comments/1j37if7/best_bitcoin_casino_reddit_recommendations_my/,Best Bitcoin Casino Reddit Recommendations - My Experience,"After spending way too much time digging through Reddit threads about **bitcoin casino** options, I decided to actually test the most recommended platforms myself. This isn't your typical ""best bitcoin casino"" listicle based on affiliate deals ‚Äì it's based on real Reddit recommendations and personal testing.

**Why Bitcoin Casinos Are Different**

Bitcoin casinos offer unique advantages over traditional online casinos:

* Faster deposits and withdrawals
* Lower transaction fees
* Enhanced privacy
* Often better bonuses
* Potentially higher RTPs

Not all bitcoin casinos are created equal though. After analyzing hundreds of Reddit comments and personally testing the most mentioned platforms, here's what I found.

**Top Bitcoin Casinos According to Reddit (March 2025)**

**1. Jackbit - Most Reddit-Recommended Bitcoin Casino**

Jackbit consistently receives the most positive mentions across gambling subreddits. Redditors particularly appreciate:

*Deposit & Withdrawal Experience:*

* Bitcoin transactions typically confirmed within 10 minutes
* No conversion to fiat (pure BTC gambling)
* Low minimum withdrawal (0.0001 BTC)
* Simple verification process for larger withdrawals

*Game Selection:*

* 6,600+ games including bitcoin-specific titles
* Full Evolution Gaming live casino suite
* Exclusive BTC slots not found elsewhere
* Provably fair original games

*Bonus Structure:*

* 200 wager-free spins welcome bonus
* Weekly reload bonuses for bitcoin deposits
* Transparent loyalty program with achievable tiers
* No hidden terms (rare for any casino)

One particularly helpful comment from r/gambling: ""Jackbit's withdrawal system is what other BTC casinos should aspire to. Requested 0.15 BTC at 2 AM, had it in my wallet by 2:12 AM with confirmation. No questions, no delays.""

**2. 7Bit Casino - The OG Bitcoin Gambling Site**

Operating since 2014, 7Bit has maintained a strong reputation among Bitcoin gamblers on Reddit:

*Bitcoin Gaming Experience:*

* Pure BTC gameplay (no conversion to fiat)
* Long track record of reliable payments
* Extensive bitcoin game selection (5,400+ titles)
* Proper provably fair verification

*Bonus Structure:*

* 5 BTC welcome package across four deposits
* 25% Monday reload bonus for BTC deposits
* 100 free spins on Wednesday deposits
* 15% weekend cashback

What Reddit users consistently mention about 7Bit is its reliability: ""Been using 7Bit since 2017, made over 50 BTC withdrawals ranging from small to quite large. Never a single issue or delay. That's worth more than any bonus.""

**3. Winna - Best for High-Roller Bitcoin Players**

For those playing with larger Bitcoin amounts, Winna receives considerable praise:

*Bitcoin Transactions:*

* Multi-sig wallet security
* No upper limit on BTC deposits
* VIP-tier withdrawal limits (up to 5 BTC weekly)
* Instant processing for verified users

*BTC Gambling Features:*

* Status matching from other bitcoin casinos
* Dedicated VIP host for large players

*Bonus Structure:*

* Status match program with cash rewards
* 60% rakeback system
* Weekly reload bonuses for bitcoin deposits
* Special BTC-exclusive promotions

A typical Reddit comment about Winna: ""Their bitcoin handling is several levels above most casinos. Transferred 2 BTC, played for hours, cashed out 3.5 BTC, and had it in my wallet before finishing my coffee. No other casino comes close to this level of service.""

**4. Hellspin - Best Bitcoin Slots Experience**

Slot enthusiasts on Reddit frequently recommend Hellspin for BTC play:

*Bitcoin Slot Selection:*

* 3,200+ bitcoin-compatible slots
* BTG Megaways collection fully available
* Exclusive bitcoin jackpot slots

* Weekly reload bonuses
* Daily bitcoin slot tournaments

Reddit slot enthusiasts particularly note Hellspin's mobile experience: ""Their mobile bitcoin slots actually work properly without constant disconnects. Been playing Wanted Dead or Wild for hours without a single issue.""

**Reddit's Take on Bitcoin Casino Games**

Analyzing Reddit threads reveals clear preferences in bitcoin casino games:

**Most Mentioned BTC Casino Games:**

1. **Crash-style Games:** Crash games receive the most discussion, with comments like: ""The transparency of Crash games is what bitcoin gambling should be about - you can verify every roll and know you're not being cheated.""
2. **Provably Fair Originals:** Games built specifically for blockchain verification get substantial attention. Plinko, Mines, and Dice variations are mentioned frequently.
3. **Bitcoin Slots:** Among slots, those with high RTP and bitcoin-specific themes get the most positive mentions. Games from providers like BGaming that specifically optimize for crypto play are favorites.
4. **Live Casino With BTC:** Evolution Gaming dominates this category, with particular emphasis on games that allow direct BTC betting without conversion.

**What Reddit Bitcoin Gamblers Actually Care About**

Based on frequency and intensity of discussion, these factors matter most to Reddit's bitcoin casino players:

1. **Withdrawal Speed & Reliability:** By far the most discussed aspect of bitcoin casinos. Comments frequently compare exact timeframes between withdrawal request and blockchain confirmation.
2. **Pure BTC Play vs. Conversion:** Strong preference for casinos that allow wagering directly in BTC without conversion to fiat. One typical comment: ""Any 'bitcoin casino' that converts to USD behind the scenes isn't really a bitcoin casino.""
3. **Provable Fairness:** Reddit users show sophisticated understanding of provably fair mechanisms and highly value transparent verification systems.
4. **KYC Requirements:** Significant discussion around verification requirements, with strong preference for platforms that require minimal documentation for standard play.
5. **Game Selection Quality:** Not just quantity but quality of games, with special attention to bitcoin-specific titles and exclusive content.

**Common Bitcoin Casino Issues Mentioned on Reddit**

While gathering recommendations, I noted these recurring complaints:

* **Network Fee Handling**: Some casinos absorbing fees, others passing them to players
* **Bitcoin Network Congestion**: Delayed transactions during high blockchain traffic
* **Unexpected Conversion**: Advertising BTC play but converting to fiat behind the scenes
* **Bonus Calculation Issues**: Problems with BTC value fluctuation affecting bonus amounts
* **Withdrawal Limits**: Surprisingly low maximum withdrawal amounts at some casinos

**Final Thoughts on Bitcoin Casino Selection**

The Reddit consensus seems clear: the best bitcoin casinos are those that truly embrace cryptocurrency rather than just accepting it as a payment method. True BTC casinos offer:

* Direct bitcoin wagering without conversion
* Transparent provably fair mechanisms
* Fast, reliable withdrawal processing
* Reasonable verification requirements
* Bitcoin-optimized gaming experience

Based on both Reddit recommendations and personal testing, Jackbit and 7Bit Casino stand out as the most consistently praised bitcoin gambling sites, with Winna and Hellspin earning strong support for specific use cases.

Christian church (she's the worship leader) and we flirted online for the past year and a half. There was never anything physical between us. 

Even after both of us had spoken about her marriage through an email I had gotten from her last February; (a press release for her husband's new breakfast house, I work in tv/radio) the eye contact continued and the online flirting through social media started. We had never talked about the sexting we were doing face to face, and on the one day I wanted to bring it uo with her, she denied everything between us and tried to pin me with a VPO (victim protective order). Obviously pissed off out of my mind, I showed up to court with a mile long paper trail documenting our back and forth online and she had the case dismissed before I could bring it up. I'm not sure if her husband will ever know the truth or not but never in a million years did I think she'd go that far to try and cover her ass. In hindsight it seems she was just trying to use me for a weekly dose of validation plus looking for promotion of her husband's coffee shop and the private school she runs. 

I know everyone has different lines they draw in terms of infidelity but phew.. is this forgivable behavior? This woman gave me a taste of how wicked a guilty conscience can act.

The Startup Showdown You Can't Ignore,"AI isn't just coming for our jobs; it's gunning for startups, and not even with an ounce of remorse. Just ask any entrepreneur who's found themselves up against a chatbot with better people skills than their own PR team. In the thrilling yet terrifying playfield of artificial intelligence, startup founders are grappling with a new reality: adapt or get absorbed.

**AI‚Äôs Glamorous Rise: Why It‚Äôs a Startup's Worst Frenemy**

Over the last few years, AI has shifted from being Silicon Valley‚Äôs shiny new toy to an essential part of business ecosystems. Its ability to process data at warp speeds and predict market trends before they've even emerged makes it a tempting tech to integrate. Yet, it‚Äôs also the same force that‚Äôs rendering many business models obsolete.

Consider the home security startup that realized its entire USP was being replicated by a $19-a-month AI service. Or that cutting-edge retail app that got punked by AI shopping assistants dishing out deals in real-time. Competition isn't just other startups anymore‚Äîit's algorithms that never sleep and don‚Äôt need coffee breaks.

**Why Some Startups Thrive in AI's Shadow**

For some startups, AI isn't the antagonist but a crucial ally. The real trick lies in knowing which role it plays in your narrative. Some forward-thinking companies have harnessed AI to supercharge their offerings, weaving intelligence into their products like coding wizards. Think AI-driven health apps that predict conditions before symptoms even peek‚Äîboom, instant differentiation!

But the secret sauce for winning? Embrace your inner mad scientist. Experiment with AI to find unexpected solutions to problems your industry isn't even aware of yet. That‚Äôs how you transform AI from your startup‚Äôs executioner to its best advocate.

**The Reverberating Question:**

In this AI-led business world, startups are in a high-stakes chess game where the pieces are data points, and the board is constantly evolving. As we straddle this line between innovation and disruption, the real question emerges:

Why couldn‚Äôt they have gone more north where you don‚Äôt have to pay 20 K for a surgery without insurance so instead, we gotta get Medicaid so we don‚Äôt go broke from all the meds. My family takes that you can show up to any pharmacy with 200 bucks in your hands and purchase every single one in their stock. Without them caring or asking why cause it‚Äôs perfectly legal. The people are a lot nicer there less homophobic, and racist specially, since the new president came in, Mexico has been climbing the ladder. My psychiatrist got mad at me because I stopped the meds that she gave me without her permission even though it made me feel dizzy nauseous like I was gonna vomit and weak like I couldn‚Äôt stand up for the whole day and then tell me I should‚Äôve made a hour long appointment that ends up being two hours just so I can stop the med that didn‚Äôt do anything I've been in therapy/psychiatrist meetings since I was 10. I tried over 20 medication where either they did nothing or had a really bad side effect one of them. I had to go to the hospital for cause it was closing my throat, and I was having trouble breathing. My dad has been going through the same mental issues since he was a kid I was diagnosed with GAD OCD autism ADHD, some kind of mood disorder and some kind of psych disorder I don‚Äôt know how I feel about all this, but I‚Äôm tired of going to meetings since I was 10. I had to go to online school due to my anxiety. I recently dropped out but in my state. I have to be a year older to drop out I‚Äôm currently not enrolled in any school. Me and my family are planning on moving to a different state. Where It‚Äôs more relaxed where I can drop out at my age. We also wanna get away from my dad‚Äôs side of family who has all sorts of mental issues and stresses us out my whole life people. I‚Äôve misunderstanding me and blame my mom for the way I am when she‚Äôs doing the best she can having an autistic husband and child my own family used to call me mama‚Äôs boy. They were all rough and tough play so it really triggered my sensory sensitivities whenever they poke at me or wrestle me so I started sitting by my mom to get away from them and then they‚Äôre getting mad at my mom for trying to protect her autistic child every time we go to therapy or a psychiatry, they tend to blame my mom for protecting me. They always blame her. I don‚Äôt know why, but I think it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs Latino well me and my dad are white me and my dad don‚Äôt talk much so they always misunderstand us and tell my mom to stop speaking for us. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable speaking to them. I feel they‚Äôre only there to hurt me. they either scold me for what I‚Äôm doing or just tell me what to do. I‚Äôm tired of it my psychiatrist is trying to get me. To go back to therapy I‚Äôve been through seven therapist and every one of them made it worse. I‚Äôm tired of the American healthcare system. I just want help not to get told him wrong not to get scolded not get told useless coping mechanisms, and given pills with a list the size of a dictionary of side effects and just because I tried a new pill in a country where you can get those pills over counter and it helped me a lot so we brought some back from Mexico and they tell my Mexican American mom that‚Äôs not how we do it in the US I swear that has to be racial people are always questioning whether she‚Äôs my mom cause I look very white she is always blamed, but she has always been there for me. My dad has been there, but he sleeps till like 2 PM and then goes to work at four comes back around 11pm and then sleeps all the way till one or two so I don‚Äôt see him much and when I do, he‚Äôs closed off he owns out and is always in his mind. He also tried the medication in Mexico and it helped him a lot so that‚Äôs good I got it prescribed by my psychiatrist, though after getting scolded and yelled at for 30 minutes. I was homeschooled for five years I don‚Äôt have any friends even when I was in school I only had to I don‚Äôt talk to anybody but my family in real life. I have online friends, but I lack connection. Sometimes I miss that other times I‚Äôm glad but it really was my only choice because after a police officer came to my school, scolded all of us and tried to scare us into behaving or you‚Äôre gonna get kidnapped by people online where you will be assaulted, or killed I had to leave my school due to that I was in fourth grade around fifth or sixth grade is when I started needing meds rather than just therapy because I was hallucinating very vivid things were attacking me and I was constantly paranoid. That‚Äôs when my OCD was at my highest I had to jump over electric sockets and duck under light switches for some time I had to jump over lasers that were constantly moving around the house and this wasn‚Äôt a game I could see it. There were spiders and bats that swarmed me I felt like there were people outside of my house with sniper rifles, looking in waiting till I pass by a window to shoot me so I ducked under windows, locked my doors done several stems like touching the door name with my forearm and dragging it diagonally, making sure the door is locked 30 times every hour constantly paranoid of people breaking in I felt like I had lasers in my eyes, and whenever there was a photo on the wall, and I looked at it from something else I had to follow the exact path back to what I was looking at otherwise I‚Äôd leave a trail. A string trail. I feel like I have a string attached to my back and eyes where I can‚Äôt circle a table otherwise I‚Äôll get tangled. I can‚Äôt circle in object with my eyes or they‚Äôll get tangled. I think about this all day. I spend practically five hours of my day thinking about compulsive thoughts and I can‚Äôt resist them. It generally is distressing it just wastes so much time. I sleep 12 hours every day cause I get so tired from doing this all day I used to be taking a med that helped me but it caused me to gain 25 pounds so I‚Äôm stuck in this loop of trying a med not working and trying another med it working in increasing it and then realizing it has a really bad side effect and then decreasing it and then I have to spend a whole month off of it and that whole month is so miserable. My mom and dad have to deal with that too. I get irritated by things very easily and constantly have mood swings every time I go to a psychiatrist or therapist. I‚Äôm fine feeling happy beforehand come out feeling hopeless. I‚Äôm really tired of this I‚Äôm really tired of trying all these meds that don‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm really tired of people triggering me. I‚Äôm really tired of going to therapy and feeling so uncomfortable. I just wanna get away from it all run away. My dad and Mom has been going through these issues too. All three of us are just med hopping and have yet to find anything suitable not to forget the meds cost so much. The only reason we aren‚Äôt debt is because. of Medicaid, my dad is very concerned about money even though he has a job that pays good but every year they‚Äôre laying more people off and getting paid less that‚Äôs why we are planning on moving somewhere where the housing cost isn‚Äôt in the 800s I really wish we could leave this country. I‚Äôm tired of America It‚Äôs getting worse and worse every year here not too long ago. My parents were sitting outside drinking coffee in my town when there is a shooting they ran away from it, but a cop and citizen were killed in the incident We‚Äôre tired of this I‚Äôm tired of this the people here care more about money and guns than actual people. And it‚Äôs this bad even though I am in one of the best states to live in Colorado. I‚Äôm done with this and I really want to get out of this place. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck and there‚Äôs no way out. Nobody here wants to actually help they‚Äôre just trying to make money off us and it‚Äôs not like we can just leave. We need a visa and then all these other requirements just to find another country to live in. I want out. I just know the process to leave is too complicated so I gotta sit here and just accept that it‚Äôs probably gonna take another 20 years before I find the meds right for me or even longer. I am a Mexican American bisexual with autism and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in America. I know I‚Äôm in two of the biggest Targeted minorities in America. I am high functioning so no one would be able to tell I‚Äôm autistic. I never got diagnosed as a child cause I seemed too normal to have autism. They just thought I was quiet it wasn‚Äôt until I was 14 where I convince my parents to get tested and I actually finally had proof that I was right I never felt normal or accepted by anyone in school that diagnosis made me feel like it wasn‚Äôt my fault for my issues, my social skills and lack of friends and people who generally liked me. Therapists psychiatrists doctors getting on me and my family‚Äòs case not realizing that the reason they don‚Äôt understand and they think something is wrong with me or my family is cause I‚Äôm autistic. The doctor always blamed my mom for why I was underweight and not eating any protein my mom just said I was picky. It really was the autism. It wasn‚Äôt until I got on meds that I finally ate and got out of the 5th percentile in underweight. I wish I could just be understood and wished my parents were understood too. People automatically think it‚Äôs my or my parents fault when really I or they can‚Äôt do anything about me. My family is struggling mentally I feel trapped and misunderstood.

1j37aeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Darkness_WithIn6833/comments/1j37aeu/magnetic_pull/,Magnetic Pull,"The coffee shop was nearly empty now, the late hour wrapping the space in an intimacy only the absence of noise could create. Valyria was leaning against the table, her fingers tracing slow, purposeful patterns on the rim of her cup, while Riven sat across from her, his attention split between the space between them and the words she hadn‚Äôt spoken yet.

Her eyes glimmered, catching the dim light as she glanced at him, aware of the way his gaze always seemed to follow her movements. She felt the pulse of his attention, the way it made her skin tingle. His presence wrapped around her like a quiet, invisible thread, pulling her in without needing to touch. But she wanted him to touch her. She wanted that connection to break the space between them.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been quiet tonight,‚Äù she said softly, her voice like silk, teasing and light, though there was something deeper beneath it. She knew he was holding back. She could feel it, the way his body was just slightly tense, as though he were waiting for permission to step closer.

Riven‚Äôs eyes flickered to hers, his lips curling into a subtle smile, but his gaze was anything but amused‚Äîit was dark, intense, and a little hungry. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre distracting me,‚Äù he replied, his voice low, almost a whisper.

A shiver danced down her spine at the words, but she didn‚Äôt let him see it. Instead, she placed her cup down carefully, her fingers brushing against the surface of the table as she leaned in, just a little closer, narrowing the distance between them. She could feel the heat rising between them, palpable and alive, like the air had thickened with unspoken words and unsent touches.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one distracting yourself,‚Äù she said, her voice dipping lower, almost a purr. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault you can‚Äôt keep your focus.‚Äù

His gaze dropped to her lips, and for the briefest of moments, his breath hitched. Valyria let her smile soften, just a little, as she rested her hand on the table, her fingers barely brushing the back of his hand. It was a fleeting touch, light as a whisper, but it was enough to send a bolt of awareness through her, to remind her of how close they were‚Äîhow much she wanted him to pull her in closer.

Riven didn‚Äôt move at first, his eyes still on her lips. But she could see the shift in him‚Äîhe was fighting something, holding back, just on the edge of something he wasn‚Äôt quite sure he should take.

She gave him a little push, her fingers tracing the line of his knuckles, the touch light but deliberate. The sensation of her skin on his made something inside her stir, something hungry and unspoken. His hand twitched, just a little, like he was debating whether or not to let the moment stretch between them, to let the tension break.

Valyria‚Äôs breath was shallow now, her body instinctively leaning toward him, as though drawn by some magnetic force she couldn‚Äôt resist. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pretend like you don‚Äôt want to,‚Äù she murmured, her voice barely audible over the soft music in the background. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been wanting it. Wanting me.‚Äù

Riven‚Äôs eyes darkened, and before she could take another breath, he moved, his hand catching hers in a firm, almost possessive grip, pulling her closer, the heat of his touch sending a jolt through her. He didn‚Äôt say anything at first. He didn‚Äôt need to.

His thumb stroked the inside of her wrist, a slow, sensual motion that had her pulse racing. His fingers slid down to her palm, his touch lingering like a promise, like he was savoring the feel of her skin against his. It was a touch that made her body react before her mind had even caught up, sending warmth flooding through her veins.

‚ÄúGod, you don‚Äôt make this easy,‚Äù Riven muttered, his voice thick with desire. His face was so close now, his breath warm against her cheek, and she could feel the tension in his body‚Äîthe way he was holding himself back, like he was waiting for something, waiting for her to give him the sign to let go.

She leaned in just enough that their lips almost brushed, her breath mingling with his, and for a long, electric moment, neither of them moved. But the pull between them was undeniable now, thick and all-consuming.

‚ÄúI never said it had to be easy,‚Äù she whispered, her voice barely above a breath. She let her lips hover near his, just a fraction of an inch away, the scent of his skin, the warmth of his breath, overwhelming her senses. ‚ÄúI just want you to want me.‚Äù

Riven‚Äôs eyes closed, his hand tightening around hers, and then, finally, he closed the space between them, capturing her lips in a kiss that was slow and deep, pulling her into him with a hunger that had been building between them, unspoken, for too long.

It wasn‚Äôt sudden.

For those of you who need motivation to keep going, I just have to say that my experience of travel now that I‚Äôm 90 pounds lighter was so radically different!

I went from worrying about a seat belt extender and fitting in the plane bathroom, to sitting comfortably on the plane without a care. I went from getting out of breath walking down the concourse and having to hail one of those motorized carts to carrying a backpack through 3 cities in Europe, no problem. 

I averaged over 20,000 steps each day. On one of our tours we had the opportunity to climb a bell tower of a church and I jumped at it‚Äî288 steps in a row, and I wasn‚Äôt even out of breath. Helps that I‚Äôm training for a 10k right now and went running every morning (running through a city is a great way to see new places!), so I‚Äôm now in the best shape of my life. 

On my last two trips to Europe, I had to sit out opportunities to go to the top of the Duomo and the Arc De Triumph. No more sitting out for me! I had to run through the streets of Amsterdam to catch a train, complete with my big backpack. But I made it and once I hopped on that train, I felt so accomplished‚ÄîI‚Äôm 52 and in better shape than some people half my age. 

The medication was a miracle for me, but only in the sense that it enabled me to get small enough that exercise was actually possible. Then I started working out, and I‚Äôve been doing that pretty much every day (weights alternating with walking/running) for over a year. Now that I‚Äôm exercising every day, I have so, so much energy and everything feels possible. 

5-hour walking tour of a monastery? Sure, sign me up! Renting bikes and biking though the city? Yes, please! Going on a 4.5 mile run though one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, and then grabbing a coffee and walking back to the hotel just as the city is waking up? Couldn‚Äôt be better! 

Yes, it‚Äôs hard work, but living life as a fat person was hard (I had a BMI for 40, now it‚Äôs 23). As they say, pick your hard. I never want to go back to that person who got winded going up a flight of stairs, was constantly worried about my heath, and automatically said no to opportunities because I knew I would hold people back or I‚Äôd struggle.

There was no grand moment of realization, no single event that made them look at each other differently. It happened slowly, like the turning of a season, like the way the tide pulls toward the shore‚Äîinevitable but unnoticed until it was already there.

They met at the coffee shop more often than they planned. At first, it was coincidence. Then, it wasn‚Äôt.

Riven would get there first, finding a table in the corner, one where the light hit just right in the late afternoon. Without thinking, he would place his book or jacket in the seat beside him, a silent reservation for someone who had never asked for one.

Valyria never had to text him to see if he was there. She simply walked in and expected to find him waiting. And he always was.

She would order their drinks without asking what he wanted, knowing the answer better than he did. He, in turn, would slide her favorite pastry across the table without a word, already aware that she would take exactly three bites before claiming she wasn‚Äôt hungry.

Neither of them questioned it.

Neither of them noticed the way their conversations stretched longer each time, turning hours into fleeting moments. The way silence between them wasn‚Äôt empty, but something else entirely‚Äîsomething warm, something full.

It was in the little things.

Like the way Riven‚Äôs eyes followed her without meaning to, watching the way she tucked her hair behind her ear, the way she bit her lip when she was thinking. The way his fingers twitched with the instinct to reach out when she laughed, like her joy was something tangible, something he wanted to touch.

Like the way Valyria caught herself mirroring him‚Äîleaning in when he did, tilting her head at the same angle, her breath slowing to match the quiet rhythm of his own. The way she noticed the faint scar on his bottom lip, the way she memorized the deep, thoughtful pauses he took before speaking, like every word mattered too much to be rushed.

The air between them shifted, but neither of them spoke about it.

Instead, it was in the way their hands hovered just a little too close on the table, fingertips brushing once, twice‚Äînever quite accidental, never quite intentional.

It was in the way Valyria‚Äôs voice dropped ever so slightly when she said his name, like it was something meant to be kept between just the two of them.

It was in the way Riven‚Äôs gaze lingered on her lips before dragging back to her eyes, dark and unreadable, like he was thinking something he didn‚Äôt dare say.

They didn‚Äôt realize they had fallen.

Not when Valyria found herself reading more books like the ones Riven loved, just to understand the way his mind worked. Not when Riven caught himself memorizing the way she moved, the way her presence changed the way the room felt.

It wasn‚Äôt sudden.

It was slow, like the gentle unraveling of something inevitable.

And maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîthey weren‚Äôt ready to see it yet.

It all started one year ago, where I was just doing lessons after school (I don't know if that's a common thing abroad but when you are trying to get to a college here it's a pretty common practice). 

We were in 2 classes together and you could say I immediately had a crush on her. However I never made any move due to:
1)My lack of confidence 
2) The pressure of studying for college 
3) If I got rejected we would still be in the same class which would have been awkward 

I told my friends I have a crush on her and they all told me the classic ""Try to approach her because otherwise you'll regret it""

Me and my entire class which was like 5 people started hanging out after the lessons sometimes.
One time she told us she really isn't looking for any relationship at the time. (I didn't bring that up, it just came up as a topic and it wasn't like I made any move other than being friendly). I don't know if it was a sign for me or anyone else but I took it as I should and I immediately halted any plans of asking her out (not that I had really tried). I made sure to never overstep my boundaries.

Afraid of the rejection I knew was 100% guaranteed, I didn't really try anything other than treating her like a normal friend. I slowly ""moved"" on. Then we had the exams and the friend group kind of split up since we didn't have any classes together anymore except in rare scenarios where we meet to see how everyone is doing that occur once every three months pretty much (those still occur I guess.) I should probably add that we didn't talk that much online either.

Where does that take us?  Present day. We haven't really talked that much the past 6 months and I was sure I had moved on from what I imagined was just a random, simple crush. A few days ago I went to a neighbouring city with my friends to have some fun . While at the club I didn't really feel like trying my luck with any girls even though I found some of them attractive looking. After the club, me and my friends just went to a coffee shop where we spend our night. The following day as we walked through the city, looking for a place to sit I suddenly saw her. We talked for 5 minutes (friendly as ever) and then just continued our day. I tried not to think much about it and continued my day with my friends. 

After a while though I realized I am such an idiot. I haven't moved on from her.  I regret my actions so, so much. I was friendly to her but I never showed her any kind of sign that I care about her. My friends told me I would regret it but I never imagined I would feel like this. I don't know what to do. I haven't talked to my friends about this because they told me I would regret it and they were right. 

I don't know . I don't know if I did the right thing or if just questioning my decision makes me overstep set boundaries? I don't know if I should try a move now (since we aren't really studying in order to get into college) or if it's too late, we live in completely different cities after all (3 hours with the bus)?  Even if I want to approach her how do I even begin after such a long time of not really speaking that much?

The complainant bought groceries, among which was a packet of Kari & Kari (Japanese Premium Snacks), from '24 Seven' for Rs. 349/-, the snack costing Rs. 99/-. The packaging of the snack showed a manufacturing date of 23.04.2021. The product, however, was sold on 11.07.2022, long after its expiry date of 22.04.2022.

Upon eating the expired snack, the complainant became sick with food poisoning, which kept him bedridden for three days. Being a successful businessman, he incurred substantial financial losses because he could not make it to a planned business meeting with Barista Coffee Company in Chandigarh. He issued a legal notice to the store on 13.07.2022 claiming compensation for mental distress, physical agony, and financial loss, but to no avail. Therefore, the complainant approached the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Panchkula, and the store was proceeded ex-parte as it failed to appear.

The Commission discovered that the shop sold the snack after its date of expiry. The complainant stated that the shop had altered the expiry date to cheat consumers, as evidenced by a similar product with an unaltered expiry date.

The Commission stressed that sellers need to verify the expiry dates when selling consumable goods. Offloading expired ones results in health problems like food poisoning. The Commission termed the actions of the store as an unfair trade practice and violation of consumer trust.

In light of the store not providing any feedback and the irrefutable proof, the Commission found the store responsible for deficiency in service and unfair trade practice. It directed the store to refund Rs. 99/- to the complainant along with 9% interest per annum from the date of purchase. The store was also asked to pay Rs. 5,000/- for mental harassment and anguish, Rs. 5,500/- as litigation expenses, and Rs. 10,000/- as punitive damages to the Poor Patient Welfare Fund (PPWF).

In addition, the Commission warned the store against similar unfair practices in the future and ordered publication of the order to increase consumer awareness and deter such occurrences.

Valyria sat across from Riven, her fingers curled around a cup of something warm, but she wasn‚Äôt drinking. She was watching him.

He was reading again. Or at least, he was trying to. His book lay open in front of him, but his fingers tapped absently against the edge of the pages, his eyes lingering in the same place for too long.

Valyria knew what that meant.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thinking too loud,‚Äù she said.

Riven blinked, glancing up. His expression was unreadable, but she saw the way his shoulders tensed slightly‚Äîlike he‚Äôd been caught. ‚ÄúAm I?‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm.‚Äù She took a slow sip of her drink. ‚ÄúYou keep rereading the same line.‚Äù

He exhaled through his nose, shutting the book with a quiet thud. ‚ÄúJust distracted.‚Äù

Valyria tilted her head, studying him. There was something about Riven, something she had noticed early on. He had an intensity to him‚Äînot loud, not obvious, but quiet and thoughtful, like he carried too many words inside him but never quite knew which ones were safe to say.

She tapped a finger against her cup. ‚ÄúWant to talk about it?‚Äù

Riven hesitated. She could see the war in his head, the way his lips parted like he might, just might, let something slip. But then he just shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù

Valyria hummed. She didn‚Äôt push. She knew better than that. Instead, she leaned back in her chair, watching the way the steam curled up from her drink. ‚ÄúI used to think I had to carry everything alone,‚Äù she said, as if changing the subject. ‚ÄúLike if I let people in too much, I‚Äôd just be a burden.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt look at him as she spoke, but she could feel his attention sharpen, like he was listening in a way most people didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúBut I learned something,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúPeople who really care? They want to listen. Even when the words feel too big.‚Äù

Silence stretched between them.

When she finally glanced at him, Riven was looking at her‚Äînot guarded, not closed off, but something else. Something softer.

For a moment, he said nothing. Then, finally, he exhaled and leaned forward slightly, resting his arms on the table.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I know how to say some things,‚Äù he admitted. It wasn‚Äôt a full confession, but it was something.

Valyria smiled, small but real. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good at listening to the space between words.‚Äù

Riven studied her for a long moment. And then, slowly‚Äîhesitantly‚Äîhe nodded.

I planned to take my mom on holiday abroad for her birthday.
I told my father about the plan and asked him if he wanted to come, once when i first told him about the plan and then two more times. Each of those times he let me know how very inconsiderate it was for me to ask him if he wanted to come with us because he has no free days of work and that it is expensive for the three of us. (i am paying for the holiday with my adult money)

After that i planned the holiday without him (tours, museums, etc.), but after a while he said he can make it with us. 
I told him that he must know that this is the first time we would go to Rome and so we have made a plan involving walking around a lot, which my father hates to do (he likes sitting in coffees and eating at restaurants - minimal walking). 
I said either he should be okay with walking a round a lot, or he should find things he would rather do alone than go on these sprees with us. 

He said ‚Äúwhy would we go to museums what is there to see‚Äù, and started making plans of us going to restaurants etc‚Ä¶.

I told him all if the above again and he said 
‚Äúi just wanted to go to Rome but you (me) don‚Äôt want me there. It‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶‚Äù, acting like i am not allowing him to go with us. 

Now i feel like crap because I want this holiday to be special for my mom and i know how hard it can be to travel with my father, especially after all of this. In a perfect world compromise would be possible in our family, but alas‚Ä¶

The coffee shop smelled like cinnamon and roasted beans, a warmth that contrasted with the cold air outside. Valyria sat across from Riven, absently stirring her drink as he read, his focus completely absorbed by the words on the page. He always looked like that when he read‚Äîlike the rest of the world faded away. She liked that about him. Liked the way he could disappear into something, even if she wondered, sometimes, what he might be trying to escape from.

Today, though, something caught her eye.

Riven had pushed up his sleeves without thinking, his arm resting on the table. It was just for a moment, but it was enough. The scars were there, pale against his skin, some older, some newer. Some still healing. Her stirring stopped. She knew what she was looking at. She knew because she had once worn the same kind of marks.

She looked up at his face, but he was still lost in his book, unaware. Or maybe he was pretending not to notice that she had noticed.

Valyria exhaled slowly. She didn‚Äôt say anything right away. Instead, she reached for her sleeve, pushing it up just enough for the light to catch her own scars. They weren‚Äôt new. Not like his. But they were there. A quiet echo of a past that hadn‚Äôt won against her.

Riven turned the page, then finally glanced up‚Äîand froze.

His gaze flickered between her arm and her face. His jaw tightened, his fingers curling slightly around the edge of his book. For a second, he looked like he might say something, but no words came. He just stared, eyes dark and unreadable, his guard up in a way she hadn‚Äôt seen before.

She could have let it go. Could have looked away, pretended she hadn‚Äôt seen anything. But she didn‚Äôt want to.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not losing,‚Äù she said softly.

Riven‚Äôs throat worked around a swallow. He still didn‚Äôt speak.

Valyria let her fingers drift over one of her older scars, tracing the faded line. ‚ÄúI used to think these meant I lost. That every one of them was proof I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to handle things.‚Äù She paused, then shook her head. ‚ÄúBut I was wrong. They‚Äôre proof that I fought. That I made it through.‚Äù

Something in his expression wavered.

She let her sleeve fall back down and wrapped her hands around her coffee cup, letting the warmth sink into her fingers. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat means you‚Äôre winning, even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it.‚Äù

Riven looked down at his arm, flexing his fingers slightly. Then, finally, he sighed, closing his book and resting his palm over the pages.

‚ÄúYou really think that?‚Äù he asked, his voice quieter than usual.

Valyria nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. I do.‚Äù

For a long moment, he just sat there, his expression unreadable. Then, finally, he gave a small nod, barely there but real.

He didn‚Äôt say thank you. She hadn‚Äôt expected him to.

Literally, those people don't need to do nothing just talk their own natural way, but because of the accent or some misterious frequencies produced by their voice, they gives me tingles and relax me down.

I used to think this is one of th gratest things in the word, being able to feel that relaxation tingles in random situations just by people talking to you or around you. But now I have a big issue with that. A coworker of mine, who's my desk neighboor, happens to have a very relaxing voice, so relaxing to be absolutley soothing for my brain. He has this specific accent and a way of pronouncing words... It almsot seems as if he was tired or annoyed all the time... but no it's just he's natural way of speaking instead. He has this strong spit movements, and this sort of loud sights whenever he's about to speak or between one sentence and another. Literally he just breaths and it gives me tingles already... But this is not pleasant at all, becasue it prevents me from focusing on my work. Whenever he tells something it just steal my whole attention, and immediatly creates a state of drowsiness... It just deactivates my brain, it makes me dumb becasue all I want to do in that moment is falling asleep... Im not joking. And there's no coffee that can help with that unless Im gonna abuse of it. The only way of being immune to this effect is having just done 100 push ups in a row, but that's not possible for obvious reason lol... Even listening to something else wearing headphones doesn't help, because I would still hear his voice anyway...

What she would dress me in,  
What she would teach me,  
How she would hold me,  
How I would grow up to be,

it's likely that she wanted me to be Strong, resilient and Kind,

as a child, I once helped somebody get their luggage on board while the train was moving and my mother was proud of me, ever eager to find meaning in small moments, she recounted the story to my father, His reaction was of indifference,

Something inside me withered. Not all at once, but like a candle suffocating in its own wax, i still get teary eyed thinking of it,

Some wounds do not bleed, but they never heal.

while she endured the pain of labor, while her body stretched, her hip bones literally shifting to make room for new life and a cascade of hormonal changes ensuring she forms an unbreakable bond with her offspring, my father‚Äôs role in my creation was... significantly easier, he had about 2.7 seconds to contribute and then roll over with a sigh of accomplishment.

Of course, the universe has a way of balancing things. It gave me my mother‚Äôs unconditional love, but it also gave my father the weight of seeing his own dreams reflected in me, after all, in evolutionary terms, a father‚Äôs fitness is measured by his offspring‚Äôs success

And what does a father do when he realizes his child is not a natural genius, not an exceptional athlete, not a prodigy in any field?

He remembers. And he makes sure I don‚Äôt forget either, he has been running Version 1.0 of *""You Have Disappointed Me""* for years without a single software update.

I won‚Äôt go into how flawed he is, because, let‚Äôs be honest, at least half of you are already nodding, thinking, *""Haan yaar, mere ghar bhi aise hi scene hai"".*

But lately, I‚Äôve been trying to make peace with being a disappointment. It‚Äôs a full-time job, really. Every time my father reminds me of some 21-year-old who cleared the UPSC exam while I, at my age, have ‚Äúachieved nothing,‚Äù and i have yet to produce status or resources that would have made me a desirable mate in some UPSC cleared laden hunter-gatherer tribe.

I don‚Äôt argue. I just stir my coffee, nod sagely, and ask him if he‚Äôs taken his diabetes meds.

The human brain is wired to overreact to negative stimuli than to positive ones, an adaptive trait that once kept our ancestors from being eaten by leopards but now mostly fuels clickbait content,

I spent years breaking myself, trying to prove something, only to realize I had taken my mother‚Äôs quiet, unwavering love for granted, That‚Äôs what I focus on now instead of being chronically dissatisfied with life like my father,

Not to win something or grind, that would doing the same performance that ruined my soul but The kind that doesn‚Äôt hinge on my place in the social hierarchy

If only my father had the awareness about concept as simply as survivorship bias and bell curve, maybe i could been spared a lot of misery.

But then again, what would we even talk about at dinner?

You can skip to the last 2 paragraphs if you wanna keep it short.,"I'm writing this as I feel like I'm in the verge of losing it again. I am a 27 yr old guy. I come from a broken home with financial trouble. Till 7th grade I was doing well in life. I was a national level swimmer with an average of 80% in academics. Then we no longer had money for school. I spent the next 8 years of my life working part time as a swimming coach but did not focus on my education. I interacted with kids but they were all either too rich or into thug like behaviour. I couldn't connect with either of them. Every festival I spent alone with my mom and her boyfriend. My dad was an alcoholic who went bankrupt. Eventually he remarried but died of liver issues sometime in this duration. Both my parents were prone to addictions and depression so I'm it might be genetic.

Then at age 21 I made some friends. A guy in my neighborhood was interested in a girl and he needed a mix group to hangout that wasn't derogatory. I have always been well spoken so he started calling me. I felt so good. I felt happiness, excitement, anticipation jealousy and host of other emotions that I had only seen in movies. Soon they started dating. Then some politics broke the group. 

From the friends I made, I made a girlfriend. I love her and am still with her. She's great in almost every sense. I really do want to build a life with her. But stupid me, instead of completing my education, I did a certificate course and started working as a fitness coach. She was about to complete her graduation so I felt like I needed to keep up. Well I worked for about 2 years as a fitness coach and realised that there wasn't enough growth here to make me capable for a family. So I tried a business. I took a personal loan for that but the business didn't work out and I'm now paying the loan for the next 1-2 years. Now I am studying and working freelance and she is in a proper career. She's making 8x more than me. I know at this rate her parents will never accept us. Now even though she is holding off her parents, idk for how long will she be able to. Marriage is big here. 

2 years ago in 2023 this realisation hit me and I got anxiety. With the loan and delay in education I was left worse off than where started. The anxiety was so bad that I couldn't do anything for a while. I could barely keep the food down my throat. This wasted another year of my life. I did work in customer service for a 7 month contract but I know I would have studied. 

Anyways since 2023, I've completed my schooling and enrolled into college. Finished my first semester too. Things were looking great. But last week I got a fever. And since recovery, the anxiety of 2023 seems to be coming back. I'm working hard to fight it off. I'm so scared of feeling like that again. I don't want to feel that ever. I am taking all the right steps I think. I'm working freelance, I'm studying, I'm not drinking or doing anything else. I haven't touched anything other than coffee for 6 months or more. But I still feel like the depression and anxiety is coming back. Please help me fight it off. I don't want it to come back.",1,1741079129.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False

Hey there!  

I‚Äôm a 25-year-old from India, currently living in Italy‚Äîbecause apparently, I thought surviving on pasta and coffee alone was a solid life plan (no regrets so far). Living abroad has been a great journey of self-discovery, mostly realizing how much I miss home-cooked food and how bad I am at folding fitted sheets.  

A bit about me‚ÄîI‚Äôm into sports, movies, and TV shows, and I have a ""slightly"" obsessive love for Formula 1. If you also enjoy high-speed drama and questionable Ferrari strategies, we‚Äôll probably get along great. If not, don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîI promise I can talk about other things too. Like how pineapple on pizza is an unresolved international debate.  

But honestly, I think good connections are built on more than just shared interests. I value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and the kind of banter that makes you laugh at your phone like an idiot in public. Quality time is super important to me‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just having a deep conversation about life (or which fictional character had the worst plot arc).  

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn‚Äôt call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won‚Äôt argue. Probably.  

So if you‚Äôre up for a chat‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport‚Äîdrop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who‚Äôs down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.

I dont smoke, I drink about 4cl aclohol a week (a whisky once in a while), I dink tee and coffee on a regular daily basis. I have some stains after a year thats why I have the cleaning done.

I have no symtoms, no pains, no holes, and yes I brush my teeth, scrub my tounge an use Listerine each day. I had no pains with my teeth in the last 6 years, no swellings which receded or something that did go away.

There was no calculus dentis found or removed in the last 4 years. All fillings you see are more than 10 years old from an other dentist than my current one.

The picture is from this year. I see nothing out of the ordinary, chatgpd sees nothing out of the ordinary, my dentist tells me a sees something which would send me into oral surgery.

My dentist is locally well connected and I fear they wont contradict each other, he sent me to a ""friendly"" other dental surgeon....

Please, tell me what you see. I have a x-ray of the special area in question and will supply it later on. I & chatgpd dont find something there either.

I had 2 hard boiled eggs and chia seed pudding (unsweetened with a 1/2 c of blueberries) and an iced coffee with unsweetened oatmilk about an hour before I went to the lab and drank the glucose drink. I didn't realize I wasn't going to be allowed to drink water between the drink and the blood draw and I was feeling really dehydrated that morning to start with and the phlebotomist having trouble with getting a vein confirmed that. 

My results came back at 135, my OB's office's cutoff is 140 BUT because I got it done at Quest and their threshold is 135, my dr said she wanted me to do the 3 hour. I don't understand that completely because if I had used their medical group's lab, I wouldn't have had to do the 3 hour. The same thing happened to my sister with 2 pregnancies, except she was at the 140 cutoff and her 3 hour was fine both times. 

I had some insurance issues that took forever to clear up and then I got really sick so now I'm at 33 weeks and my dr reminded me last week to do the test but I really don't want to. I have a severe blood draw phobia and I can handle a routine draw, but I only have a couple of places they can easily draw from and I know that 3rd time is going to be really rough. I also have my baby shower this weekend and I don't want to be bruised all over for pictures (I will look like I was beat up, happens every time and guaranteed since I'm on baby aspirin) and I just don't feel like it's necessary.

I've gained a little less than 25 lbs, my baby is healthy and exactly on track growth wise and I don't have any GD symptoms.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I have already read and commented on some posts, but I feel like venting and asking for advice/different viewpoints who are not in my direct surroundings.

  
So, a bit of context first. I am a 23 year-old, never fell in love before and just graduated uni/started my first ''adult'' job. In May last year, I met this guy through a mutual friend at university during my exam week. Normally I am very anxious around my exams, but when I met him I suddenly felt less anxious. We would always end up staying until late, and at some point we went to a pooling centre and he kissed me for the first time. Ever since then we kept texting, seeing each other and showing (**a lot of**) affection towards eachother. I had never had this feeling before.

  
We met up each week, went on dates, got taken into his social circles and we seemed madly in love. However, he and I both knew that he would leave to another country for almost five months (for his minor at uni). The day before he left, we spent the night together. I walked with him to the last part of the airport where you can say goodbye to each other and we kissed and hugged like there was no tomorrow. He left.

  
So, then he was in another country. I felt (kind of) some form of relief, because nobody had gotten as close to me as he did before. The following weeks/months my feelings grew. I missed him so much. I was busy with my master's degree and I was too broke to visit him (different continent, actually). Through everything that I was doing, I texted him every day and he did the same to me. He came back in January, so I booked us a hotel in the airport's city so we could just chill and spend the night together. 

  
When he came back we didn't see each other very often. He immediately had some exams and had to stay with his family, who live almost 3 hours away. They also don't know about his sexuality, so visiting wasn't really an option during that time. 



After two weeks, he was able to get back to his place which is way closer to mine. We started seeing each other more (AT LEAST once a week), but we were both very busy with uni and/or work. At the end of January he attended my thesis defense, met my family and friends and celebrated with us. I started working three days a week in February, and we kept seeing each other. On Valentine's day, which we both think is REALLY cringe, I gave him some pictures of us and a card.

  
Then, last week (last Tuesday actually), we met up for coffee. We were acting like normal. Kissing, touching each other and laughing/yapping. All of this in public (I know, sorry for our PDA). I kind of forgot he had texted me saying he needed to talk to me about something serious. At the end of our date he mentioned that he wanted to do that, but we did not have the time (we saw each other for 1,5 hours). I joked around a bit about it, kissed him and hugged him goodbye and went to my friend. Once I saw my friend, I told her about how I suddenly DID feel kind of worried. So, I texted him asking if he was okay. He said he was, and proposed to call later that night at 23:00. 

  
Around 23:00 I told him how he was making me nervous and he said: ''Oh no, don't be''. Then, he said he wanted to send me a text first and call after. 

  
The text basically said how he lost feelings when he was away in the last 1-2 months, but he thought it was normal after not seeing me for that long. When he came back - which was about five to six weeks ago at the moment of texting me - he tried to act normal in order ''to give us a chance and to get that feeling back''. You can guess how that went. 

  
The moment after he called me, I broke down. He suddenly was cold and distant, wouldn't respond to my texts like he did before. I really wanted to see him to talk about all of this, but he didn't really propose an exact date. In the end I texted him that we have to meet up asap, because I was going through it. 

  
We did meet up, I wrote him a letter saying how much I'll miss him and how I wish he had informed me earlier so we could work on it together. He did not even give me a chance to work with him, to help him understand himself.

  
It has been three days since I've seen him. We haven't texted. I saw a picture of him going out and just having fun, meanwhile I am going through the worst pain ever. I cannot even properly function at work, even though it's my first week.

  
Now, everyone around me is shocked. His best friends don't understand him and especially how he handled things. My mom told me yesterday that he is probably fearful and/or avoidant. I just don't know how to feel. I am hoping so badly that he will text me somewhere the next few months. And I just hope he suddenly ''wakes up''. 



Now I am reading about avoidant people. Reading about how I should let him be, and how he might come back to me. I just don't know what to feel, what to consume, where to be and/or who to talk to now. Any advise and/or reads is welcome, or any general views on this situation.

  
Thank you for reading.

* **Quality:** Nurses need shirts that can withstand frequent washing and the general wear and tear of a demanding job. We prioritized shirts made from durable materials that won't shrink, fade, or fall apart after a few washes. Look for breathable, comfortable fabrics like cotton blends.
* **Comfort:** Speaking of comfort, nurses spend long hours on their feet. The shirt should be comfortable to wear all day long,with a good fit that allows for freedom of movement. Consider the cut, neckline, and sleeve length.
* **Design:** The design should be visually appealing and well-executed. A funny saying is only as good as its presentation.We looked for shirts with clear, crisp printing and designs that don't crack or peel easily. Originality counts,too! Unique nurse shirts are a great way to stand out.
* **Price:** Cost is always a factor. We aimed for a range of price points to accommodate different budgets,but we also emphasized value for money. A cheap shirt that falls apart after one wash is never a good deal.
* **Sizing and Fit:** Accurate sizing is essential for a comfortable and flattering fit. We took into account customer reviews regarding sizing to ensure the shirts run true to size or if sizing up or down is recommended.

## Maintaining Your ‚ÄåTitanium Cookware

*   ‚Äã**Cleaning:** Most ‚Äåtitanium ‚Äãcookware is easy to clean‚Å£ with soap and ‚Äãwater. Avoid abrasive cleaners or steel ‚Äåwool, as‚Äå they can‚Äå scratch the surface. Use a soft‚Äå sponge or cloth.*  ‚Å§ **Storage:** store your cookware in ‚Å¢a dry place ‚Å§to prevent any potential corrosion (although titanium is highly resistant). Nesting pots‚Å§ and pans are ideal for saving space.* ‚Å§  **Use with care:** While titanium‚Äç is ‚Å§durable, avoid‚Å§ dropping it on hard surfaces, as it can‚Å£ still dent.

## Addressing ‚ÄãCommon Concerns

*   **Heat Distribution:** One common concern is‚Å£ that titanium doesn't distribute heat as evenly as‚Å¢ other materials‚Äç like aluminum. This is true, but it‚Äç can‚Å§ be ‚Äåmitigated by using a lower heat‚Å£ setting and stirring your food ‚Å£frequently. Some titanium cookware features ‚Å£a clad bottom with aluminum for‚Å£ improved heat distribution.
*   **Non-Stick vs. Non-Coated:** Many brands offer nonstick titanium ‚Å£cookware.While this ‚Å£makes cleaning easier, ‚Å§the ‚Å§nonstick‚Å¢ coating can be‚Å¢ scratched or damaged over time. If durability is a ‚Äåtop priority, consider‚Äã uncoated‚Å¢ titanium cookware and simply ‚Äåuse a little oil when‚Äã cooking.
*   **Titanium Cookware Price:** Titanium cookware tends‚Äã to be more expensive than‚Äã other options‚Å£ like ‚Äåaluminum or stainless steel. However,the increased durability and‚Äç lightweight properties often justify‚Äã the investment for‚Å£ serious ‚Äãoutdoor enthusiasts. Consider it an ‚Äçinvestment in your outdoor experience.

Hoping for some input re best way to spend spare 3 days around CPT. First visit to SA - 3 days in the city, then 3 days for peninsula drive and wine region (explore by car/wine tram).

We then have 3 days between Franschhoek and needing to be back in CPT for a morning flight and not sure how best to spend it. Leave Franschhoek on Saturday AM, flight is 1040 Tuesday. We like hiking, beaches, good food/coffee and scenic drives, although wouldn‚Äôt mind a bit of downtime either. We go on safari after this.

Had originally planned to drive via Oudtshoorn to Wilderness (heard this route is lovely - although could also take the shorter route). Stay 2 nights in Wilderness with one full day exploring the local area (stops along the drive other days), before driving back and staying much closer to airport on final night - car drop off is 0830. I‚Äôve heard great things about Wilderness so thought journey would be worthwhile!

Having seen traffic around CPT now concerned we might be trying to do too much. Alternative would be doing closer hiking (Mont Rochelle? Any others?) and closer beach (heard Pringle Bay is nice but open to suggestions)?

Any thoughts on either itinerary? Is the garden route/drive worth it or better sticking closer to CPT? We probably won‚Äôt be back in SA for a long time so do want to make the most of it!

Thanks in advance!

1j36e1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/pericarditis/comments/1j36e1r/positive_progress_post_week_6/,Positive Progress Post - Week 6,"Hi everyone,

I am 26 M and wanted to make a positive style post about progress as I seldom saw them when I first found this Reddit page. I was diagnosed with Pericarditis in January 2025 in Portugal (appears to have been bad seafood). I went to a&e and returned home a few days later. I want to outline my timelines below, in case it helps anyone else scrambling for information in an emergency room at 4am about this condition, and maybe what they could expect. I do however recognise it obviously varies person to person.

Week 1 - Totally incapacitated. I did 2k steps two days after the incident in a museum (the doctors didn't explain HOW much rest really was needed, or I underestimated) and dealt with stabbing pains again for about 2 hours. Ibuprofen and leaning forward really saved me in this week I would say. I needed a wheelchair for the airport home, and the first week at home I couldn't do anything, and could only sleep on my frontl. No cooking, cleaning, or walking, except for between the bed and sofa, was realistically possible.

Week 2 - About the same, and a very emotionally difficult time, as I am a very active person, and it was really difficult living like this. I would maybe load a dishwasher at best, but then have to sit down again. Missing everything about just being able to walk was so so hard, but having supportive loving people was needed, and having a real engaging hobby, not just TV, was helpful. Good days were randomly followed by bad days and vice versa.

Week 3 - Elements of progress such as being able to shower without too much anxiety, and I slept well by cuddling a pillow and lying on my right side. Ibuprofen obviously helped a lot too. I could sometimes help with dinner, but would still get those heavy chest moments, where I would stop in case of chest pains. I needed about 5 sessions of chopping and sitting to prepare pork ribs. I never got chest pains after the first week museum day again.

Week 4 - Improvements where I could cook and clean full meals. Walking was still very minimal, and I was sent to a&e again with irregular ECGs that could have signified heart muscle damage, but these luckily were ruled out. Painkillers were stopped and I could sleep in all positions.

Week 5 - This was by far the biggest improvement and while it didn't appear out of nowhere, the improvement was hugely significant and exponential just day by day. With maybe 80% pace I could do pretty regular walks, cook without any discomfort, and live a pretty similar life in terms of daily life (not including exercise, travel, or going to the office). 

Week 6 - Current week. I feel happy that things are improving, but still lots of anxiety about it getting worse again (although reasons to worry are seemingly minimal). I did 10k steps today for the first time since January. I feel very hopeful.

Below are some tips/advice I found helpful:

- No sugar, caffeine (even decaf due to the mental thought of drinking coffee, and decaf still having caffeine) and no alarms to let my sleep be fully natural for my heart's benefit.
No dairy where possible to minimise acid reflux due to the meds, as I sometimes could mentally assume this was a Pericarditis discomfort. Same for acidic fruits.
- No ibuprofen after 4 weeks as this can lead to stomach bleeds.
- The doctors won't do it for you, you have to be extremely proactive (ask for the prescriptions, ECGs, echos, MRIs).
- If you know someone reassuring with medical knowledge please reach out to them for help (my brother is a doctor and was unbelievably helpful - echocardiologists are not doctors, and can say some scary things in isolation, when not weighing up other factors i.e. commenting on your ECGs, but they don't know what they're talking about like a doctor does)
- I was not able to do anything the first week, so please reach out to loved ones for support if possible (I know this is a luxury and I was lucky)
- If possible, and someone can push you in a wheelchair, get it for the first 2 weeks so you can get some outdoor time. Alternatively, if financially possible, splurge on Ubers to your favourite park or something just to sit.
- Don't look at old pictures of yourself in the first 3 weeks doing activities you loved, because it made me cry a lot. But maybe this was good to release emotion.
- This would be 1000x harder with kids, so I imagine a lot of support from your partner for the first at least 4 weeks is crucial. Although, they will get frustrated, you have to listen to them, because it's tough for them too.
- Any stress needs to be removed. I found stress worse than movement for my heart.
- I wore a Garmin the first 4 weeks to track my heart rate and limit my steps, but I don't even think I would recommend this. You should just go based off how you feel. If your body feels it needs to stop, just stop.
- Refrained from any sexual activity for 5 weeks as a precaution, because the prospect of my heart rate increasing filled me with anxiety. Very glad I did this.
- Online grocery shopping every week so your partner or loved one doesn't have to do it, and can help with the activities you really can't do.


After 6 weeks, my symptoms are pretty much gone, but even posting this I feel nervous about jinxing this positive post and developing  recurrent pericarditis the next day...so I am staying very sensible. I plan to not exercise until at least June, never have unnatural sugar or caffeine again (I never smoked and haven't drank alcohol for 1.5 yrs so never that again either), or any useless food items high in salt like crisps, or travel anywhere in the world that isn't medically advanced (not intended to be offensive, I mean like a jungle or something in Myanmar..).

Treatment:
- Portugal put me straight on 600mg ibuprofen twice a day and colchicine. I stopped the ibuprofen after 4 weeks and tapered to a lower ibuprofen for 2 days, but this is unnecessary, so I stopped and had no pain. I still will take Colchicine for the 3 month period alongside my nexium.
- Echos, ECGs, and blood tests. Still waiting for MRI (a little myocardial scar isn't a huge deal symptomatically).

I do not intend this post to be some answer to acute Pericarditis, but when I was anxious as hell in Portugal trying to find out about this, I maybe would have liked to see this post, because the first 3 weeks are fucking awful. The worst of my life. But improvement will happen! Write down your feelings (if you feel positive, it's inspiring, if you feel shit, it's therapeutic).

If I experience no symptoms until the end of april, I will be doing a 12-hour flight, so may post about this experience in case others had plans to do long haul flights after diagnosis (again a post I would have liked to see).",1,1741077564.0,pericarditis,1,1.0,False

It was great when I was a kid. As an adolescent, I had the only period in my life where I actually went to bed at 2 or 3am and slept through the morning, but it lasted little. When I was around 22/23, I started having trouble staying awake in the evenings‚Ä¶ now that I am 27, it is one of my biggest insecurities.

At first I simply fell asleep when me and my partner were watching tv at night.
Then I started falling asleep on the table each week when we play board games with our friends. It happens every single time and they asked if I have any sleep problems.
Last night I was at the theater to watch a live show that I have waited so long for. I was really excited about it, but I had a massive headache and couldn‚Äôt keep my eyes open because the light was hurting my eyes‚Ä¶ I fell asleep and lost half of the show. My partner was really disappointed.

I have an healthy sleep schedule, I sleep around 8-9 hours per night. I do not drink coffee because it makes me sick. During the day, I am absolutely okay and I never manage to take naps because I am really awake, but as soon as the sun is gone and the dark comes in, my brain shuts off and I could fall asleep anywhere and in just one minute.

I am really sad and bummed about this. I feel like it is ruining my social life and my relationship. My partner is sad because we work apart all day and then I fall asleep in the evenings and we don‚Äôt do anything together anymore.

* ‚ùå Do NOT live near Centennial Park (West End side) ‚Äì too many homeless people, especially at night, making it feel unsafe.

# üö™ Condo Living Considerations:

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Staffing & Construction Issues ‚Äì Many condos are understaffed and poorly built. This may lead to frequent fire alarms. The walls may be super thin.
* üõó Elevator Problems ‚Äì Some condos only allow elevator access from the garage üöó, exposing you to bad air. Always ask about elevator locations before signing a lease!

# üè¢ High-Rise Apartments Are Better:

* ‚úÖ Better Services ‚Äì Many offer free coffee, better elevators, and better gyms.
* üë• Roommate Option ‚Äì If cost is a concern, split the rent with 1-2 roommates instead of settling in a studio or one-bedroom unit.

# üìú Lease Agreement Cautions:

* ‚ùå Do NOT make a contract with a place that requires 60-Day Notice Requirements ‚Äì Last-semester students are often too busy to remember, leading to extra fees. This is especially true for graduate students as the majority of graduate students are not sure when they will actually graduate. In the United States, we usually have to give a notice at least 30-days prior to your lease end date. Anything above 30 days could be seen as a trap to fool the tenants (especially international students) and get more money from their pockets.
* üí∞ Negotiate Early Termination Fees ‚Äì It should be $500 max, NOT an entire month‚Äôs rent.

# üîç Research Before Signing:

* üåê Read Reviews on [Apartments.com](http://Apartments.com) & Google Maps ‚Äì Check both the property and the management. Read from lowest ratings from highest ratings. Focus on reviews that were written by tenants that left the place so that they went through the whole process of making a contract and ending a contract.
* üåê [Zillow.com](http://Zillow.com) is generally better than [Apartments.com](http://Apartments.com) because it also shows the sale price and not just rent price.
* ‚≠ê Look for at least 4.3-star ratings ‚Äì Anything lower means red flags! üö©
* üè¢ Check the Management Company ‚Äì If multiple buildings belong to the same company, read all their reviews.

# üèõÔ∏è Better Business Bureau (BBB) Check:

* üîé Visit [BBB.org](https://www.bbb.org/) to verify the rental company‚Äôs reputation before signing if you could. It may contain the information about the company (but not always).

# üè° Recommendations:

* üåü Parke West Apartments ‚Äì One of the best visited! üèÜ
* üöó Commuting Option ‚Äì If you want to save money, live further away and drive to Vanderbilt.
* ‚úÖ Use Lemonade for Renter Insurance. The cancellation process is extremely easy.
* ‚ùå Do not make a contract with unfurnished places unless their reviews are good. If you furnish your place, it will be harder for you to move out the place.

While it provides a temporary energy boost, it can also heighten anxiety symptoms by increasing heart rate, restlessness, and nervousness.

**Spending Excessive Time on Screens** **Why It‚Äôs Harmful:** Overexposure to screens‚Äîespecially on social media‚Äîcan contribute to anxiety by overwhelming the brain with constant information, negative news, and unrealistic comparisons. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy, stress, and emotional exhaustion.

**Leading a Sedentary Lifestyle** **Why It‚Äôs Harmful:** Regular physical activity releases endorphins, which naturally boost mood and reduce stress. A lack of movement can lead to a buildup of tension, increasing anxiety levels and making it harder to manage daily stressors.

**Neglecting Sleep Hygiene** **Why It‚Äôs Harmful:** Poor sleep habits can create a cycle where anxiety disrupts rest, and lack of sleep further intensifies anxiety. Inadequate rest affects cognitive function, emotional regulation, and overall well-being, making it harder to cope with stress.

**Engaging in Negative Self-Talk** **Why It‚Äôs Harmful:** The way you speak to yourself influences your mental health. Persistent negative self-talk fosters self-doubt, fear, and worry, reinforcing anxious thoughts.

followed by my phone number and my email address, neither of which I will reprint (which you will reprint, this was a stipulation in our arrangement) in this space, for the sake of security. I'm curious what you're thinking about all this. 

I'll tell you what *I'm* thinking. I'm thinking about the form and function of art, of literature, and while I'm by no means an expert, not even particularly well-read, I sense here and everywhere around me (as I have continually for ages and ages) a marked deficiency, a stagnation, a lack of purpose, or a lack of a lack, the lack thereof, a lack that's been mercilessly curtailed by pitiful, dubious, destructive and self-destructive concerns, the concerns of food and drink (primarily) and of shock and awe (in a word: entertainment) to the exception of anything else. It's as if the whirlwinds of words were a meteorological event, a consequence of some changing literary climate, changing faster and faster as temperatures rise, and in our horror and confusion, our inability to unchange things, we settled for a simple joy in the spectacle of it all (the words move past too quickly to ponder at length); the dead bodies, the flooded streets, the homes torn up by tornadoes and the little people seen from a helicopter that pick through the rubble are playthings of a sort, objects of amusement above all else, completely dehumanized, and that's why the colors of the pressure zones and temperatures and humidity levels on once-impossible weather maps are so bright: a splash of fun. You're doing quite well. That's a complex thought, if I do say so myself. Maybe a little hard to parse, but as I said before (transcribe this word-for-word) readers who delight in frictionlessness are due for some stickiness, some undelightfulness, some scraped knees.

I'm reading it over again and I'm not sure it makes sense, but you're doing your work well enough so I won't complain. There's a good chance I'm just speaking nonsense - none of that matters, of course, not to you: you're here for the money before anything else. I have more if you need it, both ideas and money. I won't say I'm an endless fount of ideas but I have more money than you could ever imagine, and I made almost all of it illegally - this I'm willing to admit only because of something called a 'statute of limitations' and the broader convenience of my real name being long gone by now, erased, made blank: I have a new one and it's better than the old one ever was. It rolls off the tongue more deliciously and it sounds more cleanly and musically in the ear. You can't print this one either. Maybe just the first name. My first name is John.

My crimes? Of course, of course, predictably: the slightest suggestion of anything lurid (that which is erotic, unbecoming, and thus immanently interesting) is akin to an electric shock. The tongue is a valuable data point again, nine volt battery plus tongue, that's the ticket. You dig? So I guess you're itching to write something about crime, then, and I don't blame you, not really, alright, I guess that can be part of the story, if only a small one. There are many shovels for sale. My crimes? Racketeering, for one, at least that's what a Judge would call it. Getaway car driver, jewel thief, the list goes on, mine was a long and lucrative career in the underworld. The things you see on television. Illegal gambling ring. The things you don't see on television. Personal favorites among my illegalities were counterfeiting (we stuck to small bills, fives and tens, if you can believe it. Can you believe it? We had a whole system in place we worked from the basement of a seven-eleven, we'd fill the tills with our little fake bills and give them as change in exchange for bigger ones. My partner was named Bill, though he preferred the name 'Will', and to annoy him we all called him 'Willy' instead) and blackmail (by no coincidence, these are the crimes most similar to writing, or to art (someone I know was an excellent art forger, he might have been possessed by Picasso's ghost or at least Van Gogh's, his name was Henri (Like Matisse) and his accent was so strong none of us could ever tell what he was saying) apart from murder, which I never did because I believe in the human soul and I know, ultimately, that there's a place called Hell which I'm doomed to boil in for all eternity, not for my crimes (God's laws aren't the same as the state's) but for the countless petty evils everyone commits at least once in life) and now I'm bored of this so let's talk more about knees being scraped.

I was eleven years old (two ones, like my legs) and the sun was blinding me (little eyes can take a beating, the pages before the book starts, lowercase roman numerals, ""ii"" is two upside-down exclamation points after all) and there was a long long stretch of sidewalk with a row of huge deciduous broadleaf trees on one side (my side) blowing in the wind - I think they were Maple trees, like syrup comes from, yes: Maple trees, because that's part of the scraped knees memory, the whirligigs were being shaken from the trees and spinning everywhere all around me - the leaves were all red and yellow but still relatively sturdy, many (the strong ones) still holding on for dear life (they were already dead or as good as dead), whereas the whirligigs were made to fall to the earth and make more Maples, which, by the way, was the name of the street: Maple Street, it's where I lived when I was eleven, though this wasn't Maple Street, this was Pine Street (at home there were Fir trees), and on Pine Street where there were Maple trees blustering in the wind and spilling their seed upon absolutely infertile concrete and asphalt I was running as fast as I could to get home after school. I think it was Halloween? The day before Halloween? A few days before? Suffice to say there was work to be done, for fun.

I was going to be Frankenstein. The big green guy with a square skull (square because a new brain's just got plopped in there and his creator is lazy) and the bolts in his neck, Boris Karloff or if you want to have more fun Fred Gwynne or Peter Boyle, you know him. This must have been in about 1988 or 89, so decades before the running-gag where everyone delights in talking about ""Well, actually, Frankenstein was the Scientist, the monster wasn't called Frankenstein, he was 'Frankenstein's Monster',"" so when I bought that mask at the department store you could be damn sure the little slip of cardboard it was attached to said ""Frankenstein"" on it, I remember it very clearly, a purple field with the silhouette of a haunted house against a yellow moon, and the word 'FRANKENSTEIN' in drippy-green block letters, and in smaller letters 'Made in India'. I would have just painted my face, which is more traditional, but I have a skin condition. 

So I was running and thinking about Frankenstein, is the point of my story: I was running in the afternoon sun below the Maple trees, my backpack weighing me down some (it was full of worthless old textbooks) and my eagerness weighing me down the rest so I may as well have been crawling through the dead leaves and Maple syrup like a slug, a slug who could run much faster than you might expect. And this is something peculiar about being a slug or a child: you act without thinking. You can still do this as an adult, but generally I'm sure you'll agree the dictum is reversed after about the age of twenty-five, whereafter one generally thinks without acting. I wasn't an adult so without thinking, or as a result of thinking of a disordered type, I *thought* with great aggression in the middle of my sprint, mid-stride, that I should practice my Frankenstein walk: to be rigid-legged, halting, arms out in front of me parallel to the ground, like I had seen on TV, in cartoons, in the movies. Knowing considerably less about inertia or the weight of my body or the weight of anything at all other than television (sometimes we moved the furniture around, but the TV always stayed put because it weighed a billion pounds), the whole thing took less than a second, I seized up, my body turned into a counterweight, my legs a fulcrum (am I remembering the basic machines correctly?), and when I realized I was falling I gave it all up and luckily I saved myself from getting a bloody nose, anyway it was incredibly painful, when I skinned my knees - I slid across the sidewalk a couple inches on my knees, concrete tearing at my skin and quickly broadening the tiny holes already present in my jeans.

My eyes were full of tears and my knees were covered in blood. A maple leaf was smashed into one of the wounds - that one stung more than the other. For a minute or two I just sat there on the ground crying to myself (absolutely to myself, because nobody else was anywhere to be seen, there weren't even any cars driving by) and wincing and holding-but-not-holding my knees to my body, because actually touching them intensified the pain, I sat there for it must have been longer than a minute or two, now that I think about it. I think about it. What do you think of that?

I suspect the whole thing was of little importance. I limped home and my parents were concerned for me, they saw my eyes all red like my knees and they knew their role. Later that evening or the next, on Halloween night, my legs hurt so badly that the Franken-walk was impossible and a normal walk was also noticeably impaired. Obviously then, that year my trick-or-treating was far less productive than usual. My brothers (a vampire and a zombie (we had fought earlier that month, I argued that he couldn't be a zombie because that was too much like a Frankenstein and I was already a Frankenstein, but in the end I had no say in any of it)) were forced to share their considerably-more-plentiful stores of candy with me, at my mother's request, which generally I was thankful for, though I paid for that thankfulness later in life. ""Boys,"" she said, hands in fists on her hips, like a cartoon character ""it's good to share. Share with your brother."" and they complied. She actually said my name, not 'your brother', but that's not my name anymore, as previously discussed. I never liked the way it sounded, especially when she said it, especially when I was an object of pity like that, like I always was.

I remember that night vividly, Halloween night. This was at the height of the 'Satanic Panic'. I remember there was a chemical plant somewhere near our house, a neighborhood or two over, protected from prying eyes only by a chain link fence and some tall dark trees. From a smokestack or something (I don't know the first thing about how chemical plants work) there would be plumes of flame, intermittently, sometimes after dark. Everyone knew there was a chemical plant there, but we liked to imagine some pyre, drenched in blood, screams, drawn knives, we liked to believe there was a secret cult that was kidnapping kids from school and gutting them in the moonlight, we liked to believe all the worst things our parents believed or pretended to believe - yes, the truth is they were mostly pretending - they knew, deep down they knew there were no Devil-worshippers. They knew nobody hid razor blades in candied apples. They knew the whole time but they believed in it anyway. In that respect the kids were wise beyond their years, we believed for fun rather than profit, or the fun was the profit, rather than the profit the adults enjoyed from such delusions, the profit of believing in an ordered, simple, logical world where secret societies of evil-doing others were responsible for the weird music and clothing and feelings that young people indulged in. It was Halloween night, as I was saying.

My knees were killing me. My parents were nowhere to be seen and neither were my brothers. The moon was out, there were some spotty grey clouds. The sky was a deep blue. I looked at all of this through the eyeholes and the area around the eyeholes (semitransparent rubber, pale yellow on the inside, green on the outside) of my Frankenstein mask. You could say the whole evening took place inside that mask, wet with condensation from my breathing (I could smell my own breath, not a good smell when you're eleven years old and toothbrushing is too much to ask) and my running nose (I was probably coming down with something), all the sounds of my footsteps and of other children muffled slightly (like all of them were locked in a room across the hall together) you're not putting in enough effort, honestly. I want some adjectives. Give me adjectives, adjectives like 

Gloomy, Spooky, Fragmented, Lonely, Ominous, Dreaded, Forlorn, Bemused, Concerned, Perfunctory, Ghoulish, Gratuitious, Eerie, Moribund, Porous, Semi-Porous, Non-Porous, Demented, Discerning, Proactive, Feeble, Greedy, Jubilant, Fancy-Free, Poor, Miserable, Gummy, Gooey, Icy, Creaky, Moody, and so on, the more the merrier. I want to feel the words more than I want to read them or recite them. Tell me exactly what I'm feeling. Put your back into it. I want to be young again, don't you understand? I want to read the words and be young again, before my life of crime, before my shame, before my aggression, I want to fall backwards - in an act of absolute faith, a gesture of trust - I want you to catch me before I hit the ground, before I skin my knees again, and you know this story is only one of many, many moments where my knees were skinned, throughout my life. I'm remembering it for a *reason*. You ever skinned your knees? Tell me about *your* knees for once.

Tell me about last month, when you were walking up some stairs, concrete stairs with grippy black tape on them like sandpaper, perfect knee-scraping material, how you were holding a big heavy cardboard box, hauling it up to someone's apartment, a favor or probably just an odd job, and then you lost your balance for just a moment and slammed your knee into the next highest step, and how you shouted and the shout echoed vertically up and down the stairwell, and how the neighbors probably didn't hear it but they could have, and how you worried for a moment that someone might come out their door and offer you some help, the last thing you wanted, because after all you were already here to help someone else, someone you know or someone who paid you - like I'm doing now - and it was later that night (you might have spent the night) when you were looking at the 'Help Wanted' section of a newspaper (You're young and you still buy the newspaper! I like that. Keep it up.) that you saw my ad and you thought ""That sounds like easy money"", so you called me and we talked, we set up a date, you came over and sat down at my computer (for the love of god don't look at my browser history and don't open that folder called 'garbage'), I gave you a cup of coffee, you were nervous for a while, you thought *Who is this freak?* but then when you realized I was ultimately harmless the nerves faded and now you're coasting on a kind of sugar high (do you want some more licorice?), free to type whatever it is you want (provided that I want it, too), something which you don't know what it's for, and you're imagining now what exactly might be going on in this old freak's head, what compels him to tell these pointless, meandering stories, and whether he realizes exactly how insane all of this is, and whether he's noticed that you haven't taken a single sip of that coffee, if he knows it's because you're afraid, worried it might be poison, that this is all a ploy to kidnap or torture an unsuspecting victim, all this talk of children in pain, children being cut up in the forest, parents far away, unable to help them. Maybe don't tell me anything. 

A long time ago there were some places you weren't allowed to go: rooms with heavy doors, or no doors; a place where lights are dim, like bedtime, the long and the short of it is there's something that glows in the dark. I see it glowing. It's the only thing there is in a field of pure black - a tiny green shape (much like a little green man, but not a man, not a being, just an object) which if you concentrate on it, really focus, put your mind to it, begins to wiggle. It reminds you of a hula dancer - you've only seen them in cartoons - it reminds you of a cartoon of a hula dancer. Bugs bunny in drag. This room isn't quite the perfect sanctuary, there against this wall, look, or feel with your hands: a window. Locked, and you were too short and too weak to open it. There's a radiator which is ice cold, you climb it, the harsh ridges are pressing dull red lines into your leg, you put your face to the glass. Outside like a dream it's snowing, and the fog makes the streetlights bigger but also dimmer, they glow wide at the expense of distance, they illuminate only the nearest snowflakes (they're thinning out now - earlier it was a real blizzard). People are small walking through it, the snow, the color of the light (sodium vapor) tells you it's warm and pleasant out there but you know it isn't, not really. The sky up above it all is a brown haze of clouds lit pale by the same street lamps, like the whole world is under an old heavy blanket with a flashlight pointed down at a book. And you're looking at the ripples in the glass, just the same as the ripples in an icicle but wide and flat instead of sharp and narrow and less threatening too. You know, sometimes, in a cartoon or anything like a cartoon, something on TV: you know for a fact that things get ripply like this, exactly like this, and it means we're going into a dream, or back in time, and that's how it feels now - but you were already dreaming, weren't you? It was a dream from the start, I'm in a room that's bedtime, I'm in a secret enclave, I'm peering out into the vague blurry somewhere-else of the street below, I'm counting the snowflakes (I can't count higher than 20 or 30, anything more's a gazillion, a dream number) suffice to say that there's too many dreams happening at once, dreams and layers of other dreams which are their own distinct dreams, big dreams, small dreams in abundance, and now you realize that there's something terribly wrong about everything you're doing - you're bound to be punished, you're bound to be caught, no time to lose! You turn away from the window (with as much care as possible, like it's medusa, you avert your gaze from the glowing green object, in your peripheral vision it's still wiggling) and go back to the big heavy door which by some miracle opened up for you, and you close it as slowly and quietly as you can, and you sneak back to your room, you sneak back into your bed, you try to sleep, you try to dream but the dreams are outside in the window in the room at the far side of the apartment, the dreams are locked up, the dreams are stuck there like they're too heavy or too sticky stuck to the floor maybe *nailed* to the floor - your parents nailed them to the floor, why would they do that? Why did they nail them to the floor? Why am I dreaming all wrong? The inside of my head is empty - I'm not stupid - I know it's all make-believe - I know that telling a lie is wrong, gets you in trouble, I know it's my duty my obligation to apologize. I have no dream and the next morning I come clean.

*Suddenly,* JOHN *holds up his hand and closes his eyes, nodding.* THE TYPIST *stops typing and eyes their master, a look of mild confusion and embarrassment on their face. They're trembling slightly*

JOHN: I can see what you're going for. (*He reconsiders*) I *think* I can see what you're going for. Tell me more. Do whatever you want. (*The typist, relieved, having anticipated John's words, has already begun typing again*)

You know, maybe this exercise doesn't work quite as I expected it to. Earlier when I mentioned all my crimes, my sordid past, I saw the look on your face and made a mental note of it. You looked like a little animal, a mouse, a tiny lizard, one of those skinny little snakes that climbs twigs and has weak venom and tiny little stubs for fangs. You don't know the first thing about crime, do you? About the 'underworld'? I suppose it's only natural. Your hands look pretty clean. Do you actually iron your shirts? It looks like you might. I don't know if I could put it into words what it's really like. It's not my job to put it into words, of course. It's yours. If I could write something myself I wouldn't need you. I guess this means I'll have to leave some of my stories at the door, focus on the things both of us know, if I want to be 'true' to myself, to history. If I want its representation, necessarily filtered through you, to reflect the world as it really is or at least as I believe it is. 

There's forward and there's backward momentum. The tall trees have both, at both ends, underground and above, like I already said about the seeds and the changing leaves, that's forward, but there's the backward too: there's the rotation of the earth and the distortion of spacetime by gravity, the fact that time is relative, I guess, which means parts of the tree are ""older"" than other parts even if they grew ""simultaneously"". Not to get all philosophical. I could just as easily tell you that this makes the tree *less* of a meaningful structure, because if not even time can moor it or anything else to itself, then there's no basis for anything to have any value of any kind, so you might as well just kill yourself right here and now, because really ""here"" and ""now"" are relative, zeno's paradox I mean, the bullet you've fired into your brain will for all intents and purposes never touch your skin much less pierce through it

when did it become three in the morning? it must have been recently. loops of blackness in the outdoors through a window, loops that criscross like chromosomes - the sunlight, somewhere, the sound of the street lamp, if we pick up our pace. i have three mornings every morning. you're washing your fingertips in saltwater. in a small way, the night is folded. dog-eared nighttime really a morningtime where it's owls instead of robins. i can see the red seven segment display has numbers on it, it says 3:03 and I say it's time for bed. You're running out of ideas and it shows. You're probably sick of this. You're probably, and justifiably I might add, you're probably wondering if this is worth any money at all? If this is worth it, your time, all those little tendon-twitches, slowly deteriorating your muscles in your wrist, eating away at you? Like my knees, once injured, which carried me through my long long life, and I probably have a good 30 years left now that I've quit smoking. No joke, I quit cold turkey, like the day after thanksgiving. By thanksgiving '89 my knees were fit as fiddles so I rubbed them together like a cricket does. Remember when Jiminy Cricket's pointing his ass at the candle flame or whatever it was, and he's narrating this scene, it's right at the beginning - they put a joke there, he's warming his ass by the fire, and he says in the narration ""I was warming my-"" and then he stutters a little and instead of saying ""ass"" he says ""-warming my*self*"". I consider this to be one of the greatest jokes ever put to film. I laugh just thinking about it. The idea of Jiminy Cricket, who sings the song which would become Disney Corporation's logo-music, the song about making a wish and it comes true, might have said ""I was warming my ass"" with that selfsame cartoon mouth, it fills me with great joy.

You know what I'm going to do with this document once you're gone? Once our work's through? Can you guess? Go ahead, take a guess. Try to figure it out. Give me your speculative fiction.

That's right. I'm going to print it out. I'm going to print it out and staple the sheets together, however many sheets there are, and I'm going to take it to the public library and shove it in a random book. Someone will find it and it will confuse the hell out of them. That's right. I'm going to post it online. I'm going to post it on a website called reddit and a bunch of irrepressible nerds are going to pore over it with a fine-toothed comb, and they're going to run out of patience for it by the end - they'll think: This really seems kind of pointless. This is a bit shit. This is meandering pretentious nonsense. This is a hot load I'm staring at, someone else's hot load, right there in the bottom of the urinal when all I want to do is piss in peace. Maybe they'll be impressed, the more gullible ones I mean. That's right. I'm going to delete it the moment you walk out the door. I'm making you perform like an animal for my amusement. I have no desire to read anything or to write anything. This is about power and power alone. I'm going to delete it and I'm going to sit in that very same chair you're sitting in now and I'm going to open up that folder marked 'garbage' and jerk off to the most depraved thing imaginable. That's right, you see that webcam right there? It's been recording this whole thing. It's been pointed at you, at your face, watching your every move. I've got the software running in the background, the output file is in the 'garbage' folder, I'm throwing you in the garbage is what I mean, and maybe I'll even jerk off to the video? Who knows. Maybe someone else will - maybe I'm going to upload it to the internet. Maybe the not-so-nice part of the internet, did you ever think about that? Maybe, just before you get up, I'm going to pull out a knife and stab you in the throat, and maybe that's the whole point of the video? Maybe it's going to be like that cannibal guy in Germany, I think it was Germany, creeps are always from Germany. That's right. I'm going to read it out loud to the empty room, or the not-so-empty room, because this room's full of ghosts. 

You really think so little of me? All this scatological bullshit about jerking off? I guess it's to be expected. Never forget who's footing the bill, whose time you're spending, whose cash is in your pocket. Part of the goal here is to accumulate, by hook or by crook, a kind of historical record of a moment in your life. Yes, it's about you, of course it's about you! You were sitting there just exactly like you are - *exactly* like you are, like you are this very second: There's words here, words in front of you, pouring into your eyes (the opposite of tears). You get up - you go to the window - you touch your hand to the glass cold glass ice cold glass fogging up on your fingers. If it were years and years ago, if you could see the future? You're wondering: where did the good writing go? Why isn't it working anymore? Have I really run out of ideas? Is this the end?

Maybe. He was shot in the arm and the leg, he was shot finally in the skull, those are his brains on the wall over there. I think he deserves a second chance so I patch up the hole in the skull. (There's a lightning storm. I've got a loyal hunchback servant. Black-and-white there's an electrical arc that travels up two skinny silverscreen electrodes, we call it a Jacob's ladder. Who the fuck is Jacob and what's he climbing to?) a man whose legs, well, I think he died young, yes: tombstone says so, died age twenty-four, so his legs were still strong, I'll help them to run again! Yes! And over here, the arms, I need a matching pair of arms so they're the same length, you understand. This man was a doctor, just like me - a *surgeon*. The surgeon's delicate fingers - delicate fingers for precision, exactitude, thrift, speed, care, maybe even... tenderness? And finally the brain - a colleague of mine, a believer in my work; such a shame, such a shame, but it's what he would have wanted. Throw the switch. It probably needs more time in the oven, it probably needs more work, but there's an angry mob on the horizon, it's now or never, Throw the switch! The lightning bolt that fries the clock tower. The lightning bolt thrown by Zeus. Lightning bolt through the fiber-optic cable. Kilobytes that I kill, that I bite. Maybe I'm a zombie after all, braying for brains. Maybe my head's empty.

1j36433,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1j36433/funny_story_from_arad_romania/,"Funny Story from Arad, Romania","I thought I was travelling to a new place today, but I got the date wrong, so what better time than to write down the crazy thing that happened to me a few weeks ago?

I was travelling from Timisoara, Romania to Sibiu, and I accidentally got off one station  early in Arad, Romania around 1 pm. Of COURSE, knowing my luck, the next train to my destination is at 1 am. So I settle in to wait the 12 hours at a random and pretty sketchy train station as a solo female traveller.

I kid you not, less than an hour into my wait, I witnessed a robbery, but my dumbass didn't realize it was a robbery. This guy starting taking stuff out of this man's bag when he went to the bathroom, and he was wearing a similar jacket so I thought it was the same guy üíÄ. Him and another guy started (what I thought was) play fighting, so I was like 'ok, they're brothers, and theres nothing I can do about it anyways'. A police officer comes in, breaks them up, and kicks them both out. He then proceeds to sit with me, making sure I was ok and waiting until another person came into the waiting room so I wouldnt be alone. He very kindly bought me a coffee, water, and a sandwich, of which I politely declined but eventually accepted and thanked him profusely. This was super sweet! 

While I very much appreciate the kindness of this police officer, he came over every 20 minutes to have a random conversation about jesus, immigration, his lung doctor daughter, or the cows he owned- they were very cute cows. As hilarious and at times problematic as it was, I am a huge introvert and this man would NOT stop yapping. Love him tho! 

  
But WAIT, theres more!

Heres the second crisis. I was on my 10th hour of waiting, now in the main station as the waiting room closes at night, and a homeless man with a huge bloody gash in his forehead wanders over and sits on me. SITS ON ME! Another homeless man, who I was having a conversation with, picks this dude up, throws him on the ground, and I heard this huge thunk when the other man's head hit the tile. I wanted to help, but I didn't think it was safe for me to intervene in a fight between two drunk men, and eventually the Janitor came over. Did he help the man up? Of course not. He started mopping up the blood around his head as hes laying there passed out. Eventually, security guards came over and were able to help him with his injuries, thank goodness.

  
Anywho, long story short, I lived an entire lifetime in 11 hours and thats my crazy story of missing a train in Romania. Woohoo! I hope this made somebody smile or laugh, because thats all you really can do when you hear something this crazy. Lots of love <3",2,1741076246.0,solotravel,1,0.67,False
1j3634e,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1j3634e/comparing_hyd_and_banaglore_after_living_in_both/,Comparing HYD and Banaglore after living in both cities.,"I have been meaning to write this post for about 6 months - having lived in both citites below things i wanted to say

\*\*\*criticism of Hyderabad ahead\*\*\*\*\*  
I have lived in Hyderabad sri ram nagar area which is just towards left from the AMB mall toawards botanical garden road. This area is very good peaceful having very good society and also all food options BUT MAN O MAN THE HEAT IS UNBEARABLE. Oh dear god living in summer in hyderabad is absolutely a BIG PUNISHMENT. How I remeber the 4 months of each year - I am having deep mental scars trauma of the 3 years in lived in hyd only because of heat. Hyd is getting hotter each year while CHennai and Mumbai are as hot as they used ti be.  dont get me wrong the city is much better than Bangalore in terms of infra roads ppl very friendly but the only Caveat is Heat. And you simply cant beat the heat with AC or cooler all the time. I had to move out of city fearing next summer. And in banaglore yes it is much cooler and summers although hot and humid is much more bearable than Hyd. Just took the risk and it sort of paid. Some ppl are able to handle extreme heat well and some cant stand it.

But yes the infra wise roads are LAUGHABLY NARROW and potholes are worse than old hydrabad standards \[even in Indiranagar roads are not that wide\] ppl are on a murderous rage d not all societies are good. The concept of service road everywhere is difficult to grab from a hyderbadi mindset, most of the roads are zigzag and traffic signals dontwork 80 percent of the time.   Driving in hyderabad in evenings or mornings was pleasant. Traffic is slighlty worse in banaglore although hyd traffic is getting out of control lately but being managed pretty well by the authorites

The rent is cheaper here in whitefield society if you can negotiate the security deposit though and options of hindi movies in movie theatre is more. North indian street food is much better here. And yes nightlife is better here. Hyderbadi style biryani and shawarma is easily available and I am a filter coffee person \[fuck the tea.\]zafrani samosa and those bakery items are not available. Karachy Bakery is there but it sells sweets !!! Quality of service is Extremely professional and better compared to hyderabad. Maids come on time. In hyderabad my maid used to come at night 10 pm sometimes after calling 100 times no apology a look on face of doing you a big favour.

Talking about tanker issues - I am in banaglore currently and from this month I will be paying 1500 monthly tanker charges for 2 bhk flat in a standalone gated apartment , I used to shell out almost the same amount in hyd for water. As my building didnot have manjeera connection. 

Talking about the good governance - Congress gov in hyd i  doing much better than in Bangalore. EVERY SINGLE GOV EMPLOYEE IN BANAGLORE IS CORRUPT TO THE TEETH. I have not seen the levels of misconduct and bribery in UP/Bihar. All the development in banaglore is despite the gov but All the development in Hyd is becuase the gov initiaitives. But still if you know how to get things done by doing some research and talking to elders you can fly.BBMP BDA and all other agencies are absolute joke and its becuase the top leadership who want things to be like this and profit out of it.

Language and culture  - Really it is a shocker to me, no body forced me to talk in kannada here , EVERYONE knows hindi here. I was expecting ppl will be abusing me for talking in hindi but Nothing like that here, Yes an average Kannadiga citizen will love their state identitiy and culture much more compared to an average Telenganite which is a good thing. I can handle a few lines of Telugu and Kannada both I am proud that I learnt 2 additional language apart from hindi/english. Langauage and temples are a way to touch the kannadiga culture. Many  of the kannada/tamil recipe originated in temples centuries ago. I find it very rich to know experiecence dravidian culture.Cities like madurai/mysore etc are pretty nearby and good to visit. Also once your food is finished and u r done you are suppose to cover the coco leaves.  such connection I have not felt in hyderabad temples.

overall I will say hyderabad was my first love and banagalore is the one that makes me personally happy. Both the cities are liveable person to person - if your body cant handle extreme humid heat levels then GET OUT, otherwise stay in hyderabad.   for me personally , I hope to buy my home down somewhere in Mysore or Madurai and work on remote but Buying a flat on A or B khata with Kaveri connection is also not that much of a bad idea.

Glad I wrote all this - just wanted to get this off my chest and be heard in hyderabad sub cuz things are not always pleasant in bangalore sub.",0,1741076125.0,hyderabad,4,0.5,False

### **""The Ballad of Gay Ronnie""**

**SETTING:** A dimly lit back room of a seedy bar. Shadows and neon reflections create a tense atmosphere. An assortment of low-level thugs and assorted characters linger in the background.

**Characters:**  
- **Ronnie:** An undercover detective with a reputation for being edgy, who is desperate to keep his cover intact.  
- **Frank:** A gruff, no-nonsense contact who knows the score but has a wry sense of humor.  
- **Vito:** A streetwise thug with a sharp tongue and a habit of ribbing Ronnie.  
- **Sidney:** Vito‚Äôs sidekick, quick with a quip, and equally ready to escalate tensions.

---

**[Scene opens with Vito approaching Ronnie in a shadowy corner.]**

**VITO:**  
(with a wink, conspiratorial)  
""Ronnie, Frank wants to see you. And don‚Äôt worry‚Äînobody‚Äôs gonna blow your cover.""

*Ronnie frowns, clearly unsettled by the news. He glances around, then reaches into his jacket and pulls out a small pistol.*

**RONNIE:**  
(Slapping at his own face)  
""Cover‚Äôs on the line, alright‚Ä¶ better get ready.""

---

**[Cut to a sparsely furnished back room where Frank awaits. Ronnie enters, tense, gun partially concealed.]**

**FRANK:**  
(grinning broadly, in a mock-serious tone)  
""Ah, Ronnie, my good man. You‚Äôre one of the best‚Äîfor a poofer, anyway.""

*Ronnie‚Äôs eyes widen in alarm.*

**RONNIE:**  
(voice rising, defensive)  
""What did you just call me? I‚Äôm not‚Äîlisten, Frank, I don‚Äôt have time for this. Explain yourself.""

**FRANK:**  
(leaning forward, calm)  
""Relax, Ronnie. I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre an upstanding guy. You know, it takes a certain‚Ä¶ flair to survive in our world. But don‚Äôt worry about labels. Annette's not gonna know.""

*Ronnie‚Äôs jaw tightens. He lowers his voice.*

**RONNIE:**  
""Tell me, Frank‚Äîwhat makes you and the others think I‚Äôm gay? I need specifics.""

*Vito steps forward from the shadows with a smirk. Sidney follows, arms crossed.*

**VITO:**  
""Relax, Ronnie, nobody cares that you're gay.""

*Ronnie‚Äôs eyes narrow.*

**RONNIE:**  
""And what exactly have I done to earn that reputation?""

*Vito and Sidney exchange a glance before Vito speaks up, a mischievous glint in his eyes.*

**VITO:**  
""Remember that time you showed up to the stakeout in a scarf? Or how you insisted on calling your car 'The Love Machine'?""

**SIDNEY:**  
(chuckling)  
""Or when you ordered a double latte because 'life is too short for weak coffee'? You set off all the little alarms, Ronnie.""

*Ronnie frowns, voice low and edged with irritation.*

**RONNIE:**  
(sarcastically)  
""Oh, come on. That scarf was for warmth, and 'The Love Machine' is just a nickname I got from your mother. And the latte? I like my coffee strong, thanks.""

*Vito's smirk widens as he leans in.*

**VITO:**  
""Yeah, sure, Ronnie. But it adds up. The whole gang‚Äôs onto you, Gay Ronnie‚Äî""

*At the sound of ""Gay Ronnie,"" something in Ronnie snaps. His eyes flash with fury.*

**RONNIE:**  
(voice rising dangerously)  
""I am *not* 'Gay' Vito! I‚Äî""

*Before he can finish, in a sudden, brutal motion, Ronnie pulls out his pistol fully and fires at Vito. The shot rings out sharply. Vito staggers backward, clutching his chest as he falls.*

*Sidney reacts, shock turning into panic as he scrambles to intervene. But in that charged moment, the room falls silent except for the echo of the shot.*

**FRANK:**  
(quietly, almost regretfully)  
""Hey! Fuck-tard! What's wrong with you? He was only ribbing you.""

*Ronnie stands over Vito's motionless form, chest heaving, a mix of remorse and grim resolve on his face. He lowers the weapon slowly, his eyes darting to Sidney and Frank.*

**RONNIE:**  
(low, bitter)  
""What have I done?""

*Sidney and Frank exchange troubled looks, as the scene fades into an uneasy silence‚Äî.*
