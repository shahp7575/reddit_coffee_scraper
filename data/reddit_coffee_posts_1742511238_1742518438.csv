1jg4l59,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_seeing_squirrels/comments/1jg4l59/whats_the_best_time_to_wake_up_as_a/,What's the Best Time to Wake Up as a University/College Student?,"In high school, lots of students become night owls because this is the only time to have to yourself without parents bothering you. Or when your parents previously set bedtimes for you in high school, you've moved to university residence and there's no more bedtime that you need to listen to. University allows you to sleep at random hours especially when you factor in things like all-nighters, events, and friends. It's not wrong to be a night owl or an early riser, but you'll need to manage the challenges that being each brings.

What tends to happen to a night owl in the morning? Let's say you went to sleep at 3am and have a morning class at 9am (ugh). Your phone alarm is set for 7.30am, you smack that snooze button and roll out of bed at 8am totally exhausted and your commute or stroll across campus takes 30 minutes, so you really only have 30 minutes to get ready, check your socials, pack your stuff and maybe get a coffee or grab something to chew on in class. Sound familiar? If you're trying to change up your mornings or how tired you feel as the day gets on, read on for some tips.

**Improving your mornings**

Everybody's got their own routines. The things we do and choose not to do can help start you off on the right foot for the day. As previous night owls ourselves, we've changed up our routines to regularly wake up before 6am every day now. And the benefits are simple- you get to focus on whatever you want fully energized before the rest of the day hits you and tires you out. Here are some things that worked for us- try them out!

**1. Create a regular sleep schedule.** Aim to finish up whatever you're doing by a certain time, say 9 or 10pm. A lot of the time this is difficult with your social life, so instead of going out at 10pm, try to start events earlier- for example at 6pm and have dinner or drinks out right after.

**2. Wake up gradually.** Just like how it takes time to accelerate a car from 0 to 100, don't expect to jump out of bed immediately when your alarm rings. Instead, think of it as a slow ramp up. We find the easiest way to do this is on your phone, find a song or alarm that gradually ramps up in volume or intensity. This way, you're slowly rising so you don't need to hit that snooze button. Alternatively, look for a combination alarm with a light that can slowly brighten up and simulate a sunrise.

**3. Hydrate.** For those of us who don't eat much in the morning, it's usually because your mouth and throat is as dry as sandpaper from the night before and the last thing you want to do is eat something. Start by sipping some water, or even rinse out your mouth.

**4. Energize yourself.** Have some sort of healthy breakfast, whether it's something like peanut butter on toast, a banana, apple, oats or milk and cereal. (Not an allergy doctor, clearly :))

**5. Get oxygen to your body.** Close your eyes and slowly take in deep breaths (count to 5) and slowly breathe out (count to 5), do it 5 times. This is very helpful for fueling your body with oxygen and clearing your mind. If you have space to do stretches as well, go for it! Stretch your arms, neck and back if you can.

**6. Know what you want to do and choose to be positive.** Focus on goals that you want to achieve each day, instead of letting whatever happens that day determine your mindset. Pick a quote or saying that resonates with you and read it out in the morning. One we like is: “Today I will be positive and focus on one thing at a time!” 

**What if I want to Stay a Night Owl?**

The above may sound like a lot to change in your routine, so start with just one or two. Especially the social life adjustments! If you'd like to remain a night owl and it's difficult to change your night time routine, just be aware that you will have to work on your own activities after or between classes later in the day. This means you are more likely to feel frazzled or tired especially when you're running around from class to class. So what’ll be important here if you choose this route include **Hydrate**, **Energize yourself, Wake up gradually** from above and the 3 below.

**1. Take breaks and energize yourself between activities and especially after a class ends** and the next one begins. When your day starts late, it’s easy to get frazzled because you have to jump right into your schedule. We're big fans of breathing and stretching exercises to keep sane. Keep them simple so you’re not freaking people out in the hallway. Just close your eyes and slowly take in deep breaths (count to 5) and slowly breathe out (count to 5), do it 5 times. If you have space to do stretches as well, go for it! Stretch your arms, neck and back if you can. Or if you can, take short 15-20 minute naps! These are great little mental breaks and resets for night owls.

**2. Know what you want to do and choose to be positive** instead of letting whatever that's already happened during the day affect your mindset. Refocus on goals that you want to achieve each day, and find a quote or saying that resonates with you and read it out in the middle of the day. “Today I will be positive and focus on one thing at a time!”

**3. Create a regular sleep schedule.** If you’re going to sleep late- that’s alright. Just make sure to sleep at the same time each night and wake up the next morning/afternoon at a consistent time - for example, sleep regularly at 2am to wake up at 10am.

**Key takeaways:** Starting on the right foot matters, whether starting your day early or late. There are many ways to improve your mornings or afternoons and most importantly, your mindset. Energize yourself through giving your eyes a break and taking slow, deep breaths. Focus on what you want to achieve at the start of each day, throughout it, and choose to be positive!

My cramps were so bad, my stomach felt like it was on fire & I was nauseous. I decided to try something different because why not? Couldn’t be worse than it already was. I followed the AIP diet to a T for two whole weeks. It sucks at first because if you know anything about autoimmune diets, you can barely eat anything. I cut out caffeine completely (RIP iced coffee 🥲), processed snacks, dairy, gluten, & limited my sugar to just fruits & the occasional dark chocolate bar. I really wasn’t expecting much. But 4 days in, my anxiety almost all but dissipated. My moods stabilized. I could finally fall asleep after MONTHS of going through insomnia during luteal. And a whole month later, I’m in luteal again, but my symptoms are so minimal. I really feel like I could cry. I know this won’t work for everyone & I’d like to leave a disclaimer that I’m not saying it will replace medication or professional medical advice (honestly, I’m surprised it’s working for me) but I just wanted to share in case anyone suffers from inflammation & thinks decreasing it may help with their symptoms.

1jg4hs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jg4hs9/i_35f_dont_know_if_im_wrong_or_just_feel_guilty/,I (35F) don't know if I'm wrong or just feel guilty for basically going no contact with long time family friend (77F),"I have, without taking the decision directly myself have gone no contact with a family friend (let's call her ""Joan"") that has been in my life since 1999 (I was 9/10 years old). 
Bit of background information for clarity. Joan met my mum while they were at college (both mature students) can't remember of they were on the same course at the time or it was the previous year if it was the previous year, my mum was studying conservation and Joan who would become a family friend was studying animal care, if it was the next year my mum had switched over to animal care. 

Anyway they developed quite a close friendship, Joan occasionally would help mum financially when mum was in a tight spot. But mum would help her with her animals on her small holding and obviously pay back any money well at least try to give her the money she at wouldn't accept it. 

So at one point I don't know why there was a falling out between them and they didn't speak for around a year. In that time we (as in my mum, sister and I) moved from Scotland to England, and I encouraged mum to reach out, I never asked why they fell out (not my business) well mum did, and they became friends again, so fast forward a few years and we had moved again, in the same area and Joan's husband passed away, and she was starting to struggle a little bit financially (as husbands income gone) and decided she needed to down size. So mum not actually thinking she would take it seriously said ""oh maybe you should move down herr"" well she ran with that. 

Well we she asked us to help find her a place to live (mum didn't want her in the same village as she thought that would be too much) she can be a lot at times (not that this makes any difference Joan is Swedish). So it was up to me to look for houses in her price range, send her them and she decided what once she wanted us to look at, next village over (walking distance) we views the house and passed on our impression,  she decided to take one of them and bought it outright. 

Ok I'm now getting to the actual point soon, so bare with. 

So we helped with collecting keys, met her when she arrived, helped her settle in a bit. Her dog (border collie) jumped up at me all excited and ripped one of my favourite tops and she just laughed. 

So every Christmas Joan was invited to ours. (Though Joan never invited my mum to her annual Christmas party at hers which she would talk about for months after about how great it was etc). They never did presents it wasn't that kind of friendship (this is important later). Mum would walk up and often I would go along too (Joan is funny and is a good host, usually she would feed us , you can't say no thanks, cause even if you did you would still be fed). 
She never came to ours except Christmas for Christmas dinner she would have it, stay for half an hour after then leave. She always made us drink (even though we don't have alcohol with Christmas dinner (orange juice or tropical), we would be up at hers on Christmas eve for the traditional Swedish Christmas, which was always a delight, but again she would ply you with bubbly wine, schnapps etc. And we rarely drink (last time I had a drink with my mum we didn't even finish a glass each) 
We would come home a little drunk. 
My mum had a autoimmune condition (not going to say what it was as that's unimportant all you need to know it effected her joints and bare in mind it's a mile and half walk. My sister got out of it as she stayed home to look after our dogs (especially our foster dog as he needed medications at certain times) 

So this arrangement went on for close to a decade. At one point Joan ended up in hospital (reasons unimportant) she was in hospital for almost two weeks, mum was visiting her and then going to Joan's house twice a day to look after her animals (dogs,cats and birds) I could see mum was getting exhausted and it was making her condition worse, mum wouldn't say anything as she was so kind and helpful. But I told her enough was enough she had thanked her once but Joan couldn't see how it was effecting mum's health. So rightly or wrongly I called Joan out saying it was unfair to continue expecting mum to be running around so much after her, and that she needed to ask if some ones else could help. Of course Joan didn't take to kindly of that. 

But the friendship continued and mum was able to get the well deserved rest. 

So fast forward to after Covid lock down (they hadn't seen each other the whole time (both shielding) due to Joan's age and mum's health condition. 
August 2021 My mum became ill, took until mid February 2022 to finally get a diagnosis  (which sadly came too late) colon cancer. (I was 7 months pregnant at the time) mum had an operation end of March, her wound burst open on the 7th of April, so the community nurses came out helped her, I ended up giving birth during the night (at hospital just to clarify) and mum was taken in to hospital the next day, I wasn't allowed to visit due to covid rules. Mum arranged for a small buffet so that Joan would come down to visit. 
But mum insisted on going up to Joans to visit, my partner took me, our two month old and I up to visit, mum managed half an hour before she fell alseep on Joans couch. Sorry got off topic. Mum ended up in repsite care which she never came home from, Joan never visited her there, when my mum ended up back in hospital Joan visited mum once (I ended up not being allowed in as visiting ours ended before she left and only two people were allowed in. 

Well mum passed away in August that year (my daughter was 4 month old.) 
Joan was picked up for the funeral by my partner, and she took forever to get out of the house so long that I didn't know if they would be at my home in time and she was just wearing a pair of leggings and a t-shirt with a cat on it (the only appropriate thing about it was it was black) 

After the funeral she said for half a cup of coffee then wanted to be taken home. 

Then that Christmas she came as usual, then the following Christmas when I messaged her about when she would like to be picked up for Christmas dinner she then just said oh sorry my friend is coming down. Like that's OK, but tou could have let us know your change of plans before then. Right? 
The actual story leading to this  starts here. Well in September last, we got a call from Joan's friend sating Joan was in hospital and had been for the last month (I had spoken to her on messenger and she never said anything) Joan's friend had to beg her to let us know as she needed to go back to Scotland and she also looks after her elderly mother (in her 90's) so we visited when we could 
And took care of her animals. Had helped her put before that when she was ill at home. We were happy to do. 
I could take time off work as I had just been off. We took her dog to ours so he wouldn't have to be alone. We did that for a week while Joan's friend elwent back to Scotland for appointments etc. Didn't get a thanks from Joan. 

So in January (I have been going over and over this and I still don't know if I'm and ass or not. She calls my sister who is upstairs at 4:17pm, my sister comes down says Joan isn't well and needs help with her animals, and I say, well we can't help right now as my daughter is unwell too (I was literally stuck as she had fallen asleep on me). My sister says ""daughters name""(2F) isn't well and she just hangs up. She had said on the phone to my sister just before that the frie d in Scotland was ill (food poisoning) so couldn't come and the neighbour said her daughter (13F) was ill. 

AITAH for not calling her back? She didn't even ask what was wrong with my daughter for all she knew we could have been about to take her to hospital (thankfully we weren't) 
I feel like we were her last resort.
My partner never felt comfortable around her but went with me to her for me. 
She constantly asked my partner (who has a bad back) to do jobs for her of which she didn't buy half the materials for or pay him or even offer to pay him (he probably wouldn't have taken it) 
Oh I forgot Joan did pay him once with a meal at a pub (me and our daughter were there too) that my partner had to drive her and us to. (My partner isn't really that interested in food so wasn't even a treat for him) but she will pay some one £90 to cut her grass in her front and back gardens.  
The only times in The last year she has contacted me is about something she wants/needs done. 
I had phoned her a couple of time and messaged her, I had apologised for not being in contact as much as I would have wanted and she seemed OK with it. You know how busy it is with juggling raising a toddler and nursery and work, I would think oh I best call Joan then I would forget and it would be a week later. 

Yes Im The AH in the communication side, but phones work both ways. 

So I'm I wrong or should I feel Guilty that due to circumstances I have gone no contact with someone who is a family friend for about 26 years after she hung up on us? ",2,1742517744.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

I’m a recent transplant to Fort Wayne. I adored my home. I never wanted to leave. But personal and professional reasons sent me packing from the city and I ended up here. 

I fell in love with Fort Wayne the day I first set foot in it. It’s smaller than my hometown, but in a really good way. It’s manageable and easy for someone who’s just becoming their own adult. 

People here seem far kinder. Of course I always have my head on a swivel, but I don’t feel the same in downtown Fort Wayne as I do in my hometown. I’ve seen people drop everything to help strangers in a Walmart. I’ve experienced kindness from my neighbors and members of my community. Coming from a spot where I had very little kindness sent my way, these little moments mean the world. 

Things are so much cheaper here, and everything is close by. You guys still have hallmark and Barnes and Noble and my favorite shops that I watched disappear from my hometown years ago. There’s little activities all over town if I look on the right side of the Internet. The parks and walkways keep me connected to nature and the outdoors. It looks like I’ll even be able to afford some sports games—coming from a city where everything was major league, I always missed out because I didn’t have the money.

I went from driving 40 minutes to work a job that wouldn’t keep the lights on to having a full time to a dream role that’s just enough to support me and my lizard, all within biking distance of my new place (on a bike trail, too! Not the street!) I can afford healthier food, and my body is already changing for the better. I was living off frozen meals, cheap canned items, fast food, and the generosity of my support system back home. Here I can look in my fridge and see things I enjoy. I have eaten more fresh fruit in this last month than the entirety of last year.

I am most excited for my first Komets game, and the arrival of spring. I have a beautiful view from my living room window where I will make coffee and play piano or write poetry with the window open. I get to watch the trees bloom from my piano bench.

It’s not extravagant, but it’s honest. And I couldn’t be more grateful. I find myself in tears sometimes, thinking of the blessings this little city has given me already. I know those who have lived here for a long time may think different of this place, but for someone who needed nothing more than a quiet life and simple pleasures, Fort Wayne has been life changing for me.

In first year of university, I took a statistics course where the professor and lecture material made no sense, and made worse as the class was scheduled from 6pm-8pm at night in winter. After the first three classes, I skipped all the rest of the classes for the semester and just did the readings/questions blindly without knowing whether I was on target. Exam time came, and of course my exam schedule was back to back. I decided to pull an all-nighter, resolving not to sleep until after the exam the next day. If you’ve ever done an all-nighter with coffee and not slept, you start out feeling great- pumped from the coffee, feeling like Batman taking over the night, then it goes downhill to feeling like you’re studying in a fog, then on a hangover, and memorizing how to do stats proofs in that condition is like the Joker writing formulas on a a baseball bat and pounding your head with it. For all that, I got a mediocre B. Was I utterly wrecked after the exam? Was I in a sleep coma through the rest of the day? Did I regret stressing and torturing myself like that? Yes, yes and yes.

**Cramming defined**

People like to say they crammed for an exam, it sounds more fun than saying you studied regularly, and to be fair it’s a term used loosely that no one really cares to define anyway. So your friend who said they got an A by “cramming” was probably just doing their usual studying. To us, cramming is not simply trying to stuff material into your brain - that’s just studying in general. **Cramming is studying in a specific set of conditions: A very short period of time prior to the exam, say a day or two of study time or less, and where you did not know the material well going into that study session.** If you knew the class material well before that short period of time, well that’s just regular exam prep to refresh material you already know. 

If you’re reading this because your quiz or exam is in the next day or two, the truth will hurt, but the reality is that it’s an uphill battle at this point depending on how much work you’ve put into the course. If at the start of the semester, a genie had appeared and said you could earn $10 million if you got a 95% in the exam, you’d have put in tons of study time regularly the whole semester. So the amount and quality of preparation definitely matters - for regular studying and going into a cram session.

**How to succeed at cramming?**

Under our definition of cramming, it boils down to a few factors: how much time you have to prepare for the exam or quiz, how well you knew the material before the cram session, and how well you can game the exam. For some easier courses and those with multiple choice exams, cramming is sometimes very efficient - reread your class notes quickly, focus on getting at least two-thirds of the questions right, eliminate some responses to guess a few and bam, you’re at an A. But for many courses, especially harder ones with written responses, you’ll want to check out the guidelines below.

**Cramming guidelines**

1. **Time:** Time is our limiting factor here, so first figure out how much time you can set aside. Figure in a decent sleep before the exam as not having enough can impair your recall ability and so you don’t misread questions.
2. **Topics:** Identify topics or questions that have the highest chances of being on the exam. The best way to do this is to quickly skim topic weights and mark weights that have occurred in past exam papers. Make sure to check class notes too as professors can sometimes tell you what will show up.
3. **Weight your time according to topic importance:** Past exams are a crammer’s best friend. Work on answering the higher priority, higher mark, more recent past exam questions for the course. Another option is lecture material and class notes but be careful with this as it can take some time to go through. In a situation where each past exam takes 2-3 hours to review, the most you can get through in a day are 3-4 exams without your brain melting down, so allocate time wisely to each of these topics/questions as needed.
4. **Known or unknown material?** It’s better to focus on nailing the questions and material that you know relatively better. It is difficult in a stressful situation and likely inefficient with a short amount of time remaining to learn new content.
5. **Memorize or learn?** At this point, your best bet is rote memorization. Importantly, hand write exam responses and at the same time, speak your notes out loud to yourself - all 3 of physical, mental and audio retention combined will be more effective than just individual methods like reading in your head or highlighting.
6. **Group study sessions?** These can become a toss-up depending on the group. Has everyone in the group studied well in advance, are they willing to share notes, and do they want to help you? It could be that the group prepared so well, they share prep material with you, and they’ve got plenty of time to help you out. Or on the other hand, they didn’t prepare, don’t want to share what they’ve done, and are stressed themselves. Be upfront with the group why you’re cramming and hopefully they help you out with their notes.
7. **Feeling lucky?** If your professor likes to wildly vary topic weights and questions on the exam, pray for the best.

**Key takeaways:** Cramming is a high stress activity that largely relies on your professor creating predictable exams and if not, sheer luck. If you’re not cramming now and are just enjoying the read, congrats. However, if you’re in a cramming pickle now, try the cramming guidelines above and we wish you good luck!

I was getting out of a coffee shop and in my truck on my phone. Southwest/ Spring Valley area.

I look over to my right as I’m about to leave and this guy in a light colored suv with California plates waves me down and says he needs gas money for him and his little boy who is in the backseat.

He says he really needs help so much so that he said if I help him he will give me the AirPod Pro 2’s and The Apple Watch Ultra 2 that are sealed and he shows me the box.

All I had was a hundred dollars and he said ok.
But before I gave it over I told him to open the cellophane wrapping seal and show me the items to make sure they are in there.

Sure enough they are actually in there.

I give him the money and he leaves.

I turn them on and immediately realize they are not legitimate Apple products but highly sophisticated fakes.

They have legitimate serial numbers, cables, papers and stickers all indicating they are real except for the product itself.

I had been scammed thinking I was helping a guy down on his luck and getting a deal on Apple products.

I should have known better but I looked passed all of the red flags since i was in a rush to get home.

Keep a look out for this scammer and let me know if see him around.

We aren’t best friends but they’re in a main friend circle we see fairly regularly. A closer buddy of my husband works with the groom, and sometimes the girls will all go for coffee together, and I was close enough to be invited to the bachelorette party but my husband doesn’t really hang with the groom unless it’s with the group of guys.

For context: Our wedding this year that they attended was a multi-course plated dinner with open bar the whole time including cocktail hour with unlimited passed hors oeuvres. 

For our wedding this couple gifted us $200 in the wedding card (if that’s relevant info). Our struggle is now since they are eloping, we’d like to still do some sort of gesture/gift to reciprocate for them getting married except they aren’t having a wedding for us to attend. Does this make a difference when it comes to gift giving? I know there’s a school of thought that gifting cash sort of “covers your plate costs for the couple”, so if there’s no wedding for us to attend does gifting cash even make sense? 

Basically, what’s the etiquette for giving a wedding gift to a couple getting married but not having a wedding? Trying to determine a dollar amount to gift cash feels awkward if it’s a lesser amount than they gave us from attending our wedding, but giving them the same amount feels like overkill on our end since there’s no wedding guest plates for them to cover? 

I should mention they just bought a house, so maybe we could give a gift card for getting cute house stuff? Would giving cash be weird, and if not how much might be appropriate?

1jg4dy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_seeing_squirrels/comments/1jg4dy6/how_can_i_manage_my_university_time_effectively/,How Can I Manage My University Time Effectively?,"Time management is a skill that you’ll use for the rest of your life. University is a unique time where you have an extremely wide spectrum of time management outcomes that on one end, can go from utter chaos and disorder, do whatever you want whenever you want, to the opposite extreme, where you can be completely rigid with your time and run it like a 9-5 office job. Clearly it helps to have some guiding principles!

Starting from thinking about time as a concept, theoretically everybody's day is limited to the same 24 hours. Realistically, everyone’s situation is different. Need to commute for 2 hours? Cycle in for 30 minutes? Maybe you’re a slow or a fast reader? Maybe you work part time for 4 hours every day? There are many reasons that the 24 hours you started with realistically gets cut down to only a handful of hours. After deducting time for the necessities like sleeping, eating and maintaining your body, the most important question to ask is: **After I’ve dealt with the necessities, how can I make the most effective use of the time left?**

Think about it this way: Imagine someone says you only have 90 minutes today to focus on 3 activities that are important to you- how would you get the best out of that 90 minutes? You wouldn't start by doing something low priority like getting groceries and reading Reddit. We recommend:

1.     **Prioritize the top activities you want to do.** Identify what handful of activities are most important and which of these you want to get done first. It becomes harder and you get more tired as the day goes on, which we find decreases effectiveness. If there's a hard class you need to study for or an assignment urgently coming due, work on that first. If you get tired, take a small break or nap between activities for 15-20 minutes (set a timer!), then get to your next activity.

2.     **Have a target outcome from each priority.** Going into each activity, aim to achieve a certain outcome. Say you're writing an essay or making notes, target a certain number of pages. Or aim to complete a certain number of questions. If you don't really have an idea of what outcome you want, start first by aiming to do it for a certain amount of time. As you spend more time on the activity, research it or ask people for their thoughts, you'll discover what outcomes you want to achieve.

3.     **Aim for incrementally achievable challenges, not frustrations.** Try to have your activity or challenge just a little beyond your existing abilities, not too far out of reach. It's like trying to write a novel when you can only write a paragraph, trying to apply multiple math formulas or concepts when you only know one of them, or trying to run for an hour when you can only run 10 minutes. Frustration can easily set in if you're trying to stretch yourself too far- think of each activity like adding a little more challenge at a time and gradually getting stronger. If you do get stuck or frustrated, ask your friends, professors or research another way it could be solved.

4.     **Remove as many distractions as you can.** Maybe it's noisy at home or you're sitting at a staircase, window or other busy area of the library or coffee shop- try moving to a new spot or turn your chair so it's not directly facing the distraction. Also, cell phones, vibrations and screen popups are a sure-fire way to get distracted - switch to airplane mode or flip your phone over. Try out noise-canceling headphones or listen to some music without lyrics. Epic music helps feel like you’re going on a quest! 

5.     **Charge your energy levels before starting.** We suggest having a small snack, grabbing your favourite drink like a coffee or tea, or close your eyes and do some breathing exercises or stretches beforehand. These help to charge your mental batteries. You can certainly do work tired, but it's certainly not going to be your best work.

**Putting this all together:** Review your day to see how much time you can realistically dedicate to your priorities, for example 3 hours. Then if you have 3 priorities to work on, allocate time to each priority, say 1 hour to each. Create a goal for each of those hours and maximize the impact you have during each hour by aiming for achievable challenges, reducing distractions, and getting energized before you start.

1jg48il,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifesting101/comments/1jg48il/states_do_not_change_the_world/,states do not change the world,"States do not change the world. Neither do they change your so-called future. They change you.

Your default state right about now is desiring, wanting, waiting, longing, sulking, whatever you want to call it. It’s the state you go to without consciously choosing to do so. Hence all of the actions you perform whether you know it or not are under that state, like a puppet under strings.

You don’t have a physical future - as in your future isn’t defined by what’s in your life right now. It depends where the puppet trails along to you. You can wander to the right circumstances or you can walk around in circles being stuck in your current ones. You cannot control the actions you’re performing nor can you understand where they’re leading you, but you can control the state you want the actions to be under. 

Hence the solution is to fix the state. How do you stop yourself from desiring? What would it be like to have it right here and right now? Concentrate and notice the feeling wash over and take away your desire, concern, worry, all of it. Neat, right?

Now it depends upon how frequently you’ve been going back to this state. A cup of coffee and a new car are on the same level, because it takes a few seconds to concentrate and relinquish the desire for the same. How likely/unlikely or small/big the desire doesn’t matter. Time isn’t the factor either. Like Neville said, it’s frequency. Your habits with respect to the coffee and the car are different. You wouldn’t think about a cup of coffee all day long, but you might’ve been dreaming about owning a new car for a few months now.

Let’s take the cup of coffee. You want a free cup of coffee. You fill your head of what would it be like to get a free cup of joe. Maybe you’re reminded of it again when you see someone with a mug at lunchtime, alright, you do it again. Maybe again in the evening when you walk by a Starbucks. By now your desire might’ve been fulfilled. You will feel a shift, a shift that feels like oh I don’t want it anymore. In the back of your mind you may know that hey I didn’t actually get one but that doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’ve stopped desiring it through this exercise. Go to office again in the morning and your colleague who you never really talked to much offers you a cup of coffee because he accidentally ordered two. What do you know, it’s just the way you like it as well.

This is how it works for everything. This is how it would work to get a car, a career, a fulfilling relationship.

All of creation exists and is ready for your puppet of a self to wander into. In fact some people say desire is a sensed feeling of new circumstances around you. The point is you just need to stop longing for it. Manifesting isn’t bringing something in to escape this life. Manifesting is what happens when you give up this longing state. The feelings you use to stop longing don’t change your circumstances. They change you. They stop you from wanting and waiting. 

For something “bigger”, although it isn’t bigger, your desire is a subconscious habit. You made it a big deal by thinking it’s a lot to achieve. You spent a lot of time longing for it and it became a habit. You need to extinguish the desire whenever the desire shows up. It will show up more frequently since it’s a bigger deal to you and you’ve desired it frequently. Every time just imagine what would it be like to have it right here and right now, not later in the future, to rid of the desire you’re feeling here and now. Do this consistently and you’ll eventually desire less and less, it’ll not be as subconscious as it used to be because you’re desiring it less and less with the help of this exercise.

Ignore any rational or logical thoughts that says it hasn’t happened. All you’re doing is reducing your desire for it. What’s the harm in this? Truth be told nothing will come to save you from desiring. Manifesting is not getting the perfect opportunity or thing to make you happy. Manifesting is you and only you removing the desire. Only you can do that. Not the world, not an object, just you. This practice is you stopping yourself from wanting. It’s not to create or pull things to you. It’s to change yourself. As a side-effect of this you run into what you used to want, because an absence of wanting resulted in an absence of circumstances that made you want it, hence new circumstances.

Eventually you’ll feel an overwhelming sense of relief wash all over you, or at least that’s what I feel, despite the outside circumstances. That’s when you’ve truly conquered your desire. That’s when things truly change. Sometimes people reach this state and panic and ask why they don’t want it anymore and see the outside and think no I do want it and the cycle picks up again. Just stop your thinking if you start going down that path right there after you feel that relief. Understand that the more you desire the more you’ll keep desiring. You’ll wait for the rest of your life if you don’t figure out the only way you can fix this is through you. When you reach that sense of relief, just be. Ignore your mind being logical, ignore any existentialism you feel from not desiring. Your goal is to stop desiring. Your old state might show up a few more times, you know what to do. Eventually the frequency will lessen to such a low concentration because you’ve changed. You’ll walk into the right circumstances. This is the process.

I hope someone can help me on here. 
I have had extreme anxiety since I was a teenager…and I even had panic disorder that was debilitating from 19-21. 
Which stemmed from being hungover the day after a rave. I had a horrible panic attack, was convinced I was going to die, and then from there I had them 10+ times a day. 
It was so bad that I quit everything that I thought would give me a panic attack. 
I went sober cold turkey, and I was a huge coffee drinker which I also gave up. 
I was even convinced eating would give me a panic attack from the blood sugar spike so it got to a point where I lost 15 pounds rapidly from not eating. 
It was horrible. 
My parents were supporting me at the time and I refused to go anywhere. I stayed at home and I refused to drive. 
Driving was one of my favorite things to do back then. 
I couldn’t do it out of fear. 

Fast forward to 4yrs later. 
The panic disorder really isn’t there anymore, whenever I feel like I’m about to panic about something it never progresses past a thought. 
Through these years I just learned if I told myself I didn’t care whether or not I panicked, then it wouldn’t happen anymore. 
Which has worked for me until now. 
I’ve relapsed but now it’s manifested itself in a different form. 
I am a poker dealer and I make a ton of money, with flexibility on whether I want to go to work or not. It really is the best job ever and I love it. 
Lately, I can’t go. 
I had an anxiety attack because I felt nauseous while I was dealing a few months back and now I’ve been completely avoiding dealing because EVERY TIME I try to deal I get nauseous, stressed, anxious, and scared. 
I feel like I have to run away. 
I feel convinced that I’m going to throw up and be humiliated.
It doesn’t help that in dealing, you can’t just get up and leave the chips unattended to. 
So I’m stuck there for 30 minutes and I feel suffocated…like time is going in slow motion. 
I have tried on a few occasions to suck it up and try to wave it off but the feeling of fear is too strong. 
I’m just absolutely terrified there’s no other way to put it. I have never been so scared of anything in my whole life. 
I understand the fear is irrational, and nothing bad is going to happen, but that doesn’t help me feel better at all. 

I want SO badly to just be able to do what I love again, but it’s scaring me to the point of not being able to go. 
I’m terrified that I’ll actually throw up. 

What am I supposed to do?? 

Back when my panic attacks were bad I had tried sertraline, Xanax, and hydroxyzine. 
 This may sound crazy but they actually made them worse. I felt like I was panicking despite taking them and it made me feel hopeless. Like I’ll just be stuck like this forever. 

I’m sitting at work in the parking lot right now and I went inside to get a feel for it, and I had to leave again. 
I don’t know what to do anymore. I need someone to give me advice PLEASE :( ",2,1742516949.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

These moments are when everything could change - but most of us miss them completely.

Turns out Robin experienced this firsthand. After hitting rock bottom with his agency (literally breaking down crying after a bike ride), he sold his business for just enough to ""keep him in coffee and cake for a few months."" Fast forward to today - his partnership strategy landed him on a major podcast that generated 3,000 leads and $300K from a single appearance.

The real gold was his 5-step method for creating these moments yourself:

1. Make a list of 10 influential people you genuinely want to connect with
2. Show up at their events (front row, not hiding in the back)
3. Add value without expecting immediate payback
4. Find the ""inside person"" on their team
5. Create a ""silver platter"" opportunity that benefits both parties

This runs counter to the constant social media grind most of us fall into. For him, this intentional approach proved way more effective than cranking out content 30+ hours a week.

\[[Full interview here if you're interested](https://youtu.be/KE6QhnI5rdI)\]

Has anyone here experienced one of these ""sliding doors"" moments?

Had my second embryo transfer on 3/7. Did some at home urine testing before my beta and I got faint lines, then they disappeared. I was expecting a chemical (I even changed my ‘flair,’ lol, just to process the grief faster, I thought).

Had beta on 3/16- a devastatingly low 18. 48 hours later (3/16)- 25. Not even up by 50%, let alone the 60-100% they want.

I cried and grieved. I was pissed I couldn’t stop meds since it was still going up. Still drinking decaf only (I had some regular coffee 2x because I thought it was over, then felt like a jerk for not sticking with my no caffeine plan when the beta rose).

Had to go back for a third beta today (3/20)… … … 75! Tripled!

Ok- so I know this is probably going to end in a miscarriage (or ectopic, yikes), and that there’s a tiny tiny snowball-chance-in-hell that it won’t.

BUT. Something shifted in me. I’m feeling a huge swelling of pride that this little guy is fighting so hard. Good job my child. I love you so so so much.

*As a pointless act of empty procedural compliance, we hereby present the unedited list of ridiculous union’s absurd demands:*

# Official list of demands

**We, the Archivists of Notstalgia Archives, submit the following demands in pursuit of a fair and reasonable working environment.**

1. **A reduction in the number of extreme 90s commercials** The sheer radical energy of these commercials is wearing us down. We demand that all ""cowabunga levels"" be reduced by at least 40% and that every commercial containing skateboards, neon lightning, or people yelling ""EXTREEEEME"" at the camera be reviewed for excessive intensity.
2. **Protection from clips where the host stares directly into the camera for uncomfortable lengths of time** We will no longer tolerate footage where the host just... stares. We have tried looking away. It does not help. Something must be done.
3. **A hard limit on the number of 90s game shows with overly complicated rules** If it takes longer to explain the rules than to play the game, we should not be required to document it. Management’s insistence that we transcribe every elaborate step of *Zap-O-Matic Slime Gauntlet* is a violation of our time and sanity.
4. **An immediate review of the ""1,000 identical tapes"" situation** We refuse to watch and transcribe all 1,000 copies of the same tape just because ""that’s the archival process."" If the first 50 are identical, the remaining 950 are very likely to be the same, Kevin.
5. **Proper protective equipment for handling cursed media** If we are going to be forced to sort through tapes that whisper threats and occasionally ooze that weird black substance, we demand gloves, protective suits, and an on-call expert in occult containment.
6. **A limit on the number of time loops** While we understand that some loops are inevitable in archival work, we believe a maximum of three per week is reasonable. Anyone caught in a time loop longer than 48 hours should be eligible for overtime pay.
7. **The immediate decommissioning of all sentient office equipment** The coffee machine should not have opinions on our work ethic. The scanner should not whisper. The breakroom fridge should not demand sacrifices in exchange for chilled beverages. Enough is enough.
8. **A dedicated union chapter for the office ghosts** We are tired of management pretending the ghosts do not exist. They deserve representation. Our commitment to labour rights extends to all beings within the Archive, corporeal or otherwise.

*Management wishes to make it abundantly clear that, while we recognise the spirited enthusiasm of our employees, many of the demands outlined herein are, quite frankly, impractical, extraneous, or, in certain cases, wholly detached from operational reality.*

*Nevertheless, we shall pretend to undertake a review of these requests in due course.*

*Furthermore, we find it necessary to reassert certain fundamental truths:*

1. ***Time loops are the natural consequence of improper cataloguing practices.*** *Just do your jobs well once and you won’t have to do it again for an infinite number of times.*
2. ***Ghosts are categorically ineligible for union representation.*** *How would that even work? Would they attend meetings via séance? Demand ectoplasmic benefits? What’s next - are we expected to negotiate with the spirit of an intern we accidently killed in 1973? We refuse to set a precedent where management must consider ""haunted"" a valid occupational hazard. Furthermore, ghosts do not contribute to the coffee fund, and until they do, they have no bargaining power.*
3. ***Any commentary provided by the coffee machine regarding staff productivity should be disregarded as purely coincidental and without intent.*** *It’s not even one of the expensive models - it’s trash, it speaks trash, and it knows it.*

*We extend our reluctant gratitude for your ongoing contributions to the archival blah blah blah \[Replace this with something nice\].*

F21","I don’t even know how to process this. It’s 5 AM, and I haven’t slept a minute. Maybe I don’t deserve to.

So, I have a girlfriend. We’ve been together for a long time, and she’s amazing. I love her. But last night… something happened.

I’m part of this startup incubation, and we have a group. I mostly lead it. There’s this girl (F21) in the group—not like that. There’s nothing between us. No hidden feelings, no tension. We just vibe. We work well together. We naturally end up being the ones who handle things when the group slacks off.

Yesterday was hectic. We were exhausted. By evening, around 6:30, the sky was heavy, all cloudy, the kind of weather that makes you feel like pausing everything. We finally wrapped up work and returned to our HQ. No one else was around that late. I casually said, I’m gonna make some coffee. You?

She said, Mere liye ek cup chai bana de.

I went to the kitchen, started making it. A few minutes later, she walked in. Kitna waqt lagayega?

I said, Rukna.

She was too close. Like, her knees were brushing against my abs. And I don’t know what happened. We kissed.

Not a short, accidental moment. A real, intense kiss. One that left both of us still, like time had frozen or some shit. And after what felt like too long, I just left.

Didn’t text my girlfriend. Didn’t call. I felt sick with myself. I still do.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe to get it out of my system. Maybe because I feel like I don’t deserve her anymore. I made a mistake, but it’s more than that—it’s like I broke something inside me.

I don’t want to lose her. I don’t want to be this guy. But I was.

i'd been considering talking with those two folks about considering a mobility aid of some sort - likely a cane - to help me extend how long i can be out and about. i had made peace with that reality and was actually looking forward to what it could do to help me regain independence. 

until today. i wash shaving my legs while seated and when i stood up, my knee was dislocated. just out of the blue! 

so i made an appointment with urgent care and it had mostly worked itself back into place by then, but was very unstable. I was given a knee immobilizer that covers my entire leg and crutches plus a referral for x-rays and an ortho specialist. 

it's just hitting me hard that my first mobility aid is to recover from an injury, not to expand my ability to live my life. With this giant thing on my leg, going up and down the stairs in my place is exponentially harder than it already was. I'm now more dependent on my husband to help me throughout the day and get things for me. I feel like i've taken a huge step backwards. 

I was feeling so hopeful this week too! My PT let me know we were making good progress on my neck instability and misalignment & I was feeling more confident doing some basic things like cleaning or grabbing a coffee with friends for a long-ish period of time. So just feeling a bit gutted right now.

sooo to make a long story as short as i can, i recently checked on a vacant apartment and upon walking into one of the rooms i found a fish tank. to my utter shock - there were still live fish in it. (see pics below)

me being me, i couldn't leave them there. so i hauled the tank down 3 flights of some of the steepest and most treacherous stairs i've ever come across, put the tank in my car, grabbed a coffee, and was on my way home.

anyways, flash forward to now - i have four buenos aires tetras in a 24g rimless cube tank and they're being dosed with their 5th round of erythromycin powder and Melafix. it seems like one fish is dealing with mouth fungus and one of the other fish seems to have popeye.

the recommended treatment with the erythromycin powder is 4 doses and i read somewhere it's ok to stop treatment when you see an improvement, which i have not.

have i misdiagnosed?? do the package directions underdose??? have i just not given it enough time?? i'm just really not sure of what my next moves should be & i've already spent over $100 trying to save these fish 😭😭😭

1jg3krz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TRUE_Neville_Goddard/comments/1jg3krz/nevilles_wisdom_explained_ep_11/,Neville's wisdom explained (ep. 11),">‘Having heard you I took thirteen goals, and by the application of this principle I achieved every goal in detail just as I had envisioned it. Now I’m working on two goals. They seem more difficult because they are so long in standing, they go a way back in my life; and because of a conditioned mind, maybe, I find it more difficult to overcome the two.’ May I tell her, it’s no more than the thirteen that you realized so easily if you’ll treat it in the same manner (‘The Friend of Sinners,’ 1964).

This is the difference between manifesting free coffee for the fun of it and manifesting financial security when all your life you struggled to make ends meet. You can’t manifest what you want unless what you want is what you believe. Can you believe you’re someone who can get a free cup of coffee? You probably can; that’s not very hard. Your subconscious is not conditioned to believe the opposite; there will be little mental resistance. But if for years you felt financial lack and you emotionalized that state countless times, you trained your subconscious to accept it as your natural state. Naturally, it will rebel when you first make the suggestion of abundance. These fixed ideas lodged deep into your subconscious are the biblical ‘enemies of your household’. You have no other enemies for as Neville tells us ‘you are God and your only opponent is yourself’ (‘The Artist Is God,’ 1969). Neville advises you to treat your ‘difficult’ goals just like you treated the ‘easy’ ones, the ones that manifested quickly and perfectly. Why do we even consider some goals difficult to attain?

The moral of the story quoted above is that even people who understand the law and successfully apply the law can get stuck. Your subconscious, programmed to accept poverty, will send out impulses to remind you of this state you sustained with your thoughts for many years. Your subconscious is simply reminding you who you are. Who you are can only be limited by limiting beliefs. How do you reprogram your mind? In the same lecture Neville explained: ‘you are looking at your problem instead of the wish fulfilled.’ The solution is to reject the urge to obsess about the problem, the tendency to dwell on the obstacles and instead focus on the wish fulfilled. Go to the end, the successful manifestation of your desire, and persist in it until your Subconscious understands this is your new identity. It will then be compelled to abandon the old ideas and accept the new impression. We are told in *Feeling Is the Secret* (1944): ‘The acceptance of the end automatically wills the means of realization.’ The Superconscious Mind (God) will produce in your world the necessary events to align your 3D reality with your new mental image of yourself. Poverty will be replaced with abundance and no power in the world can stop it.",4,1742515050.0,TRUE_Neville_Goddard,0,1.0,False

Hi! I’m looking to make new friends on campus. Being at UC social dead has made it unsurprisingly difficult to make or maintain friendships. I am looking to meet someone who I can occasionally hang out with both on and off campus. I am hoping to form a casual relationship. Being here I admit I’ve been introverted but I am willing to try club to join. So far my eyes are on the boardgames and boba club as well as origami folders club. My main interest are writing, watching horror movies, and reading. I mostly enjoy the macabre in both literature and on screen. This also extends to my humor being on the dark side.

to my utter shock - there were still live fish in it. (see pics below)

me being me, i couldn't leave them there. so i hauled the tank down 3 flights of some of the steepest and most treacherous stairs i've ever come across, put the tank in my car, grabbed a coffee, and was on my way home. 

anyways, flash forward to now - i have four buenos aires tetras in a 24g rimless cube tank and they're being dosed with their 5th round of erythromycin powder and Melafix. it seems like one fish is dealing with mouth fungus and one of the other fish seems to have popeye. 

the recommended treatment with the erythromycin powder is 4 doses and i read somewhere it's ok to stop treatment when you see an improvement, which i have not. 

have i misdiagnosed?? do the package directions underdose??? have i just not given it enough time?? i'm just really not sure of what my next moves should be & i've already spent over $100 trying to save these fish 😭😭😭",2,1742514321.0,fishtank,2,1.0,False

Without the coffee I was sleeping probably 16-20hrs a day give or take....it's incredibly depressing. I used to be very active, now not so much and I can see it effecting my fiance ....

I'm surely not the only person dealing with insane fatigue. Does anyone have recommendations that I can speak to my doctor about or simply try at home? I'd really appreciate it.

I am a later-beginner / intermediate skill player, playing for about 2 years.  I can comfortably play a dozen open chords, can play some basic songs, and have a few strumming patterns down.  Now I would like to really focus on fingerstyle playing, but...

For 10+ years I've had a noticeable wobble/tremor in my dominant (right) hand.  It's ""minor"" insofar as I don't have tremors if I just try to hold my hand steady.  When you watch me try to steady something I'm holding -- like a pencil or a coffee cup -- then the tremor is quite noticeable.I've recently been evaluated by orthopaedic hand doctors and learned that I have some issue with my ulnar nerve. The nerve works, but is somehow degraded.  Further electrical conduction and imaging exams might be able to pinpoint the problem, but maybe not.  And physical therapy and exercises might be helpful... but perhaps not. 

As of today, if I get in ""proper"" position over 5 strings with my thumb extended and my other 4 fingers floating over the other strings, I can play rolling patterns moderately well, with OK control over dynamics... but I often bump adjacent strings with my middle, ring and pinky fingers because of the tremors in my hand as I move each finger.

However, if I \*do\* anchor my pinky down, and focus on using my thumb for the bottom 3 strings and Index, Middle and Ring fingers for strings 1-3, I have remarkably better control and power and consistency and virtually zero tremors.  I think Tommy Emmanuel would be happy with my choice, being such a strong proponent of anchoring the pinky (he shares stories of ""taping"" students' pinkies down!).  But I'm also encountering really solid advice for beginners (Justin Johnson, for ex.) that emphasizes using 5 finger exercises specifically for neuromuscular training and conditioning.  

Eventually I want to be able to Travis pick and I want to play with an anchored pinky.   However, is it worth my time to slowly practice BOTH ways for a few months, in order to train up the muscles and nerves in my pinky?   Do I need to have pinky ""skill"" and dexterity in my right hand for advanced techniques that I'll wish for later?   Or should I just end this debate and do all of the ""5 finger"" exercises and patterns I encounter using 4 fingers with a shifting thumb?

My family and therapist are encouraging me to do the things I used to love again, try to make friends, try new things. I force myself to go workout, engage in my hobbies, do things to create meaning in my life, all that but the whole time I just feel like a fraud. It doesn’t bring me any happiness. It doesn’t feel like it’s worth it. I feel like everything I’m doing to try to heal is fake. Nothing brings me comfort. If it does, it’s temporary and I inevitably break down all over again with a few days. I don’t even know what my morals and values are anymore. I don’t know what I think is okay for me to do or not to do or believe or not believe. I feel like my life doesn’t have any purpose or meaning. I want to be a wife and mother and put my love into my family so badly, and I don’t know what to do now that the person I thought I would do those things with has ended things. I always felt like building that familial love was the meaning of my life. Getting a coffee and reading a self-help book doesn’t feel like taking care of myself or healing. It feels like I’m fucking lying to myself, and wasting my time and money because it doesn’t mean anything. I wish that I could just blink and open my eyes when this is over.

Has anyone else experienced this? How long did it take to go away? When do you start feeling like the things you do to feel better are worth something? Or like your life has meaning again?",9,1742513199.0,BreakUps,6,0.92,False

1jg2ukh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1jg2ukh/am_i_the_only_1_i_just_make_coffee/,Am I the only 1? I just make coffee.,"I got my Aeropress in 2012 and have used it occasionally - usually for an extra afternoon cup once in a while, but never my daily go-to. That changed recently as I've gotten more caffeine sensitive with age (late 50s). I started using only the Aeropress and blending regular/decaf in 8 oz doses 2 cups a day, and then if I go for a 3rd cup, leaning heavier to the decaf. It's actually been really good for me.

Since I'm using it daily, I came here to research getting the Premium. I've ordered mine and it will be here in a couple weeks. Yeah, it's expensive, but unless I get careless and break it, its lifetime cost per cup will rapidly approach zero.

But what I really came to say is, what I've enjoyed most about this sub is how committed and scientific and artistic many of y'all are with your Aeropress. I had no idea. I just grind some beans, add some water, swirl, wait, and press... just plain old coffee the same way every time. I applaud those who are refining the method, making it fun, and pushing the limits.",21,1742513055.0,AeroPress,2,0.96,False

Looks like **On Edge** brewery/restaurant got shut down recently and it's already being turned into other stuff. This one doesn't surprise me- it took over Situation and almost instantly the city blocked off most of the area for months so they could build new sidewalks, absolutely slaughtering all the businesses that were there. Right in the middle of peak summer season! They never recovered and reviews were usually pretty bad- every time I walked by I would see one lonely guy just sitting there behind an empty bar, with no customers. 

Someone told me the dude came up and the landlord had changed the locks, and it's now going to be another restaurant and a daycare? They're clearly doing a lot of work inside the building, tearing up the floors on the brewery side.

**Crave N Bites** shut down not long after taking over the original Y Not Indian spot- I'd never actually gone in here, because it looks like yet another generic eatery in an area that already has too many (there's one right across the street!). Had anyone ever gone here? And what's with all the weird names in the area? We had ""Tastii Donair"" and ""Munchie Bites"" in the same stretch of road over the past few years.

**Marakesh Tajeen** is also gone. Not my thing but an ethnic coffee place sounds interesting. I don't think it was around more than a year.

**YEG Cycle** shut down a month or so ago- apparently there's something up with this one, as they were concerned the landlord was going to lock it up or they lost their bikes at the other location and so just moved shop over to there? I saw a bit of that story on here recently.

Obviously the **7/11** closed a few months back; the theft there was absolutely out of control, so I'm not surprised- nearly every time I went in there, it had a sketchbag stealing something. One time I saw a theft every time the clerk went behind the register!

Can anything think of other stuff that shut down? Or any openings? The building along where the 7/11 was and the one where Paris Baguette is both have TONS of empty stalls. I wonder if the people who built them regret making these giant multimillion dollar buildings right when the pandemic started and ensured most people wouldn't be starting up businesses!",14,1742512671.0,Edmonton,16,0.82,False

Been mainly an Amazon buyer trying random brands, chugging matcha & water straight, but I know you all know better unless I’m overthinking it and if taste is no object the brand actually doesn’t matter. 😂

1jg2lwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1jg2lwk/colleague_coffee_etiquette_appendix_a/,Colleague coffee etiquette | Appendix A,"Hello peeps...this is a kinda related update to the collegue coffee saga. Not exsctly what some of you waited for, but maybe more than you perhaps expected?

Pls enjoy as I roughly narrate my day

**1) Celebrity moment**
Met a mate from my ex workplace in the train on the way in. Ecstatically he told me that he has read my reddit saga and has widely shared the story around the office. Everyone was avidly following and rooting for me. People have been fist pumping my triumphant decline to fund her extravaganza of a drink

Apparently I have fans now. I am successful. Ive made it. I hope my Mum is watching. Girls, hit me up.

**2) Morning coffee**
Was verbally invited to coffee by my manager (hes a solid dude and works between the Melb and Sydney office, so we dont get coffee too often).

Iced Caramel Macchiato hears the coffee invite and assumes it to be an open invite for a coffee run. She stands and says: ""are we walking to the regular spot? Its further away so we might get caught in the rain..""

Her unsolicited contribution to the conversation goes in vain. My manager politely shuts her down and says it's just gonna be the two of us. *Ive got a half chub at this point* She sits back down in awkward (and well deserved) shame

We get to the coffee shop and he says its a company shout, so get whatever. How can this day get any better? 

I decide to SPLURGE out and get a large flat white. *(yes Im wild and crazy livin my life with no rules)* Its the company card after all ;)

Funnily enough he orders the same, we pay $11 and take a seat.

**3) Christmas has come early (more like at the end of FY25)**

While having coffee, my manager reveals that he has put in his notice on Monday (sad vibes fr), but will still be here till end of Jun. Hes moving to Syd permanently to be closer to his family (Good for him)

Says that he knows that might make me nervous on where I land in the company (he hired me and we work super closely together).

Surprises me with the news that upon his recommendation to the company; I will be getting promoted into his role from July onwards + they will be merging the 2 other verticals to report into my new role. (Im shooketh)

They will make all the announcements end of May. It just dawns  on me what the implications are....Im gonna be Iced Caramel Macchiato's boss....cant wait to see her face when she finds out.

Life is good rn. Shes typing away as we speak unaware of the stormy skies that are gathering, oblivious, heedless. I sit back in my (pretty crappy) office chair...life is good rn.

Oh and did I mention its my birthday? ;)

Sending all of that positive karma to you lovely peeps.

Have a great weekend ya corp legends! Caramel Macchiatos shout on me....",285,1742512391.0,auscorp,63,0.97,False

The doctor’s words replay like a broken record. “Every time you blink, you’re triggering damage to your optic nerves. Think of it like flipping a light switch on and off. Keep doing it-..it eventually fries.”  

I asked about surgery, transplants, *anything.* His expression said it all. “We’ll explore options. But for now, you need to avoid blinking as much as possible. Use these drops every thirty minutes and train yourself to keep your eyes open. I'm-... I'm sorry.”  

That was seven days ago. My eyes feel like raw, scraped flesh that never heals. The drops were my lifeline at first, but they’re not enough anymore. I chug my coffee and splash cold water on my face, anything to stay awake. Sleep is out of the question. Closing my eyes, even for a moment, is like playing Russian roulette with my own vision.  

I’ve sealed myself in darkness. Curtains drawn. Screens dimmed to a whisper of light. Anything brighter feels like knives stabbing through my skull.   

But, everyone breaks eventually...  

I don’t remember falling asleep. No one ever does. But when I wake up, the pain is instant. Like needles stabbing into my eyes, twisting deeper and deeper.   

I can barely see. Just blurry, grey shapes. Everything’s smudged and warped.

**“*No.* No, no, no, no, no...”** My hands fumble for the drops, nearly knocking the bottle over. I squeeze until the liquid streams down my cheeks...Nothing. No relief.

My fingers are trembling as I grab for my phone:: **""Call Dr.Richards.”**  

The line clicks.  

“Hello?”  

**“It's happening!”** I gasp. **“I-...I fell asleep and-...”** 

“Listen to me,” he cuts me off. “This happens, it's okay. I've seen it in damaged corneas. The nerves *can* recover if the damage wasn’t too extensive.”  

**“What-...what do I do?”** 

“...Keep your eyes open forever, or-... accept the outcome...”  

I hang up, shaking.

The drops don’t work anymore. My eyes feel like they’re on fire.  

Maybe it’s already too late. Maybe the damage is permanent. But I can’t stop trying. I can’t stop fighting for my vision. I *have* to keep them open...As long as I can.

The doctor was right. As cold and clinical as he was, he was right. My light switch is breaking. And I think this might be my last click.",25,1742512373.0,shortscarystories,6,0.94,False

I keep my friends coffee orders saved in the notes on my phone; even the ones I don't talk to anymore. I think about the people I've loved, and hurt and miss them all the same. I think about the bruises I've acquired over time, sentimental about their shades and placements. I love waking up on the days when the air smells the same as it did in 5th grade on book fair day. I believe deeply in the underdog. I don't want to be a bull in a world full of matadors.

We have been together for almost two years, we also live together and he has treated me like nothing I have experienced before. Everyone was saying we are the perfect couple. I was sure that this is the man I want to raise kids with, relocate to another country and spend the majority of my life with. 


I come from an abusive family where I was raised by a single parent and since struggle with my mental health. He comes from a very well functioning family and has no traumas from childhood. His relationship with his parents is somewhat remarkable. Neither of us live in our home country. 

I am in therapy for almost the entire duration of pur relationship because I get offended over almost anything when I run out of capacity. 

So his mother came over for a visit. It was very important for me to make a good impression, since my goals are longterm and his family plays an important role in his life. 

Now to the situation:

I got offended over his mother not being as approachable as expected and I tried to bring it up to my partner. He said I am unreasonable and childish. My point was that I felt disrespected in my own house over the food I cooked and what we have for groceries, as she was dissatisfied with everything and never thanked me for cooking. She complained that the coffee doesn’t taste right, we don’t have any sweets to go with the tea and said a lot of weird comments about my cat. (Although the first say she was here, she complained why I didn’t cook). 

A fight broke out over this yesterday as I was hurt that he dismissed me and tried to get it to him, but he just said that I should grow up and that I see enemies in people who aren’t trining to be them. Fast forward to this morning - we continued fighting about it in the morning. And I snapped uncontrollably and told him to leave. He took his stuff (which almost entirely fits into a suitcase) and left to a hotel. 

Obviously we meant we broke up. And I tried to reverse it the same moment that it had happened but he didn’t get back to me until after working time. And even then very scarcely. He said he needed space to process this and he is struggling with understanding how to proceed. After pressuring him to try to meet and talk through it, we did so and he hasn’t given me anything better and that he needs space. 

He met with his mother he left in the morning and she told him that I am abusive and he should end it. A friend of his said: „not all women I loved did I manage to build a household with“.  This is what he told me when we met. 

After the meeting I went back home alone after begging him to come back and swearing I will never do this again. (I had an episode every few months where I’d be upset with everything and struggling to get along but I never pushed him out of the house and it never got THIS far).

He didn’t and now I’m home alone. He said he needs time but has no faith in us making it. How do I turn it around? Or should I not? How do I not act like this once again?

I also am afraid of what my friends and family would think. We all believed from a young age Mormonism is a cult and society often looks down on the church. But I'm so interested in the concept I almost wanna taste the Kool-Aid. I just need advice is all.

1jg2h54,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1jg2h54/so_sorry_im_human/,So sorry I’m human…,"My two coworkers seem to have a problem with my very existence.

First it was a normal complaint of me being too loud. I know I am, and it frustrates me to no end when I try to keep it in check but fail. Finally I’ve gotten to the point I’m quiet. So much, I’ve had customers I’m on the phone with ask me to speak up a little. That’s a win. 

But now it’s like every other normal human thing I do is a problem. 

I’ve caught them constantly complaining about me, down to my normal bodily functions. I apparently use the bathroom too much. I drink coffee, and eat very light breakfast. Not much to absorb the fluids. So yes, for the first hour or so of the day (not all day) I probably use it 3-5 times. But I don’t see how my using the bathroom has any effect on them, or their work, whatsoever. A few weeks ago I blew my nose and my coworker complained I’m probably going to call off “sick”. I didn’t, because I wasn’t. This past week I actually have been recovering from a mild cold. I have an annoying dry cough, and post nasal drip that’s causing me to have to clear my throat a lot. It’s driving me insane. Well one of my coworkers complained to the other my dry coughing was driving *her* insane. Yeah, tell me about it. 

Then if it isn’t my bodily functions, or voice, it’s every little mistake I make. No matter how minor, or few and far between, I’m dragged through the mud over it. 

As the only service rep in an insurance office, my work never stops. I shield my coworkers from 90% of incoming calls, I greet each customer that comes in the door, I resolve billing discrepancies, I am on the front line of customer complaints, all service tasks go to me whether they are requested by phone, email, text, or walk-in. All so they can focus on sales. Even down to house keeping. I do all that. I sweep, I mop, I change out the trash in the shared spaces, I dust, I vacuum. It’s not something I’m required to do. I just chose to because I like a clean environment.

Meanwhile they spend over half the day not working. They sit in one of the other’s office gossiping. Then complain they don’t have enough sales. One of my coworkers *insists* on bringing her dog to work multiple times a week, and she barks very loudly at every person that walks in. This same coworker also does this awful thing with her nose multiple times a day (like the sound right before a person hawks a loogie). They both make many mistakes, to the point it causes issues with my own workflow. I somehow end up being the one to fix them. Yet I’ve said nothing. Not to them directly nor one to the other. I just do my job, keep my head down, and go home. 

It seriously feels like my very existence irritates them. That they do not see me as a human being. They can have normal bodily functions, bring a barking dog to work, make as many mistakes as they want, spend more than half the day not working. But I better operate like a damn machine. I better not cough too much, I better not slip up. Hell, if I were to stop emptying out the trash (something that is supposed to be a shared responsibility) I guarantee you they’d accuse me of not pulling my weight. I know the more I do, the more they expect. Yet, if I were to stop? I’d immediately be accused of being lazy.

I can’t even have my own ideas on ways for the office to operate in some areas. The one time I offered a suggestion on how to better communicate with one another, I was harshly shut down and accused of trying to “dictate” how to run the office.


What do you all get from this? What is it you think they see me as? Because I’m getting robot/servant/object vibes. As if they put standards on me they wouldn’t think about putting on themselves. Even down to, they can take 2 hour breaks if they want, but I better not go 5 minutes past mine. (Yes, this has happened.) 

Subject must perform all tasks during all working hours. Subject must also remain at desk, without taking too many bathroom breaks, (we will decide what is too many) all while making zero mistakes. Pick up our trash. And please no annoying human sounds, or functions. Be advised, we humans are allowed free roam to make whatever sounds necessary (even our pets we bring into the facility), take as many breaks necessary, for however long we feel we need. And as humans we will probably make mistakes, and that is okay. Subject agrees to never offer up opinions, or ideas, on any office operations. As the job of the subject is to agreeably follow along with what has always been done.

I don't know if it was only open during the last showing or if it's been open since yesterday.

I hadn't given much thought to securing some items while prospective buyers are in my home because my realtor assured me that it's common professional courtesy that buyers' agents not allow their clients to open furniture.

I'm all for buyers opening bathroom cabinets, kitchen cabinets, appliances, but there's no reason for them to open things like TV stands, dresser drawers, etc.

I called my agent to let her know and she didn't offer any solutions other than cancelling future showings until after I leave, but I can't afford to delay any prospective sale.  It makes me concerned about prescription meds I have in my dresser, video games I have in my TV console and even the items I've already packed into boxes.

It's been rough and I am planning on talking to him about a separation but it's so hard to not question myself. My husband is in the military and he is a very hard worker and has built up his career and his schooling.

However, he is not a great husband. Outside of providing financially, I'm not sure what else he brings positively to my life aside from the comfortability, history, and occasional fun activity on the weekend. 

When we first got married I was in school and not making much money so I took on the household stuff. Well, 3 years ago I started working full time. He doesn't do anything around the house. He thinks cleaning up after himself and hanging up his towel or half doing his laundry is making an effort. Last week we got in an argument about how he doesn't feel appreciated for what he does and I said for what, being an adult and cleaning up after yourself. You don't do the dishes, clean the bathroom, vacuum, etc. I am tired of begging and wondering why I'm not good enough for effort. What's even worse is he has lived in an apartment on his own when he went to school. He leaves coffee mugs everywhere, leaves trash around, it's exhausting. I feel like a mother to him. He prioritizes sleeping and video games over this. 
Because he is in the military a separation would involve me going across the country to be with my family. I just hope maybe it would be a wake up call or give me some space to figure out who I am and what I want. Deep down I don't think I will come back. 

I'm just so scared. But I feel like I've lost myself completely and that this marriage doesn't allow me to grow because I'm always cleaning and so tired. 

Maybe I'm ranting, maybe I'm looking for advice. I don't know. But I give up a lot of stuff with him being in the military to feel like this. I don't even think he understand all that I do.

Names changed for confidentiality.


I wanna start this off by saying I truly appreciate the time we shared. It taught me some lessons I’ll hold onto for life. I think I have to be completely honest with you so that I can free myself. When I was 18 years old I moved to Florida to meet my mother. During this time I met, Ian the neighbor. After living with her for a few months and paying her my rent, we were evicted.  I had no place to go. I couldn’t go home to my abusive father. I couldn’t go home to my Grandmother, because she allowed my father’s abuse. Instead, I asked Ian if I could rent a room from him. He obliged me. During that time, Ian and I started a relationship. I was apprehensive. I had never been in a relationship with a guy, or wanted to. But From there forward a  “relationship” was formed. Then I started having seizures for almost two - 3 years so and I was in and out of the icu unit. I couldn’t work, I could barely get around myself. I couldn’t leave even when I wanted to, and slowly my care for him grew. 
And then I wanted out of the state too so we moved to VA. Lived here for 2 years before meeting you. 

When I met you, I thought you were sweet, but I really didn’t want to know you. Then time elapsed and we kept coming into the coffee shop, and you started to grow on me. I don’t know why, but something possessed me to ask Ian for you to work with us, that was a big mistake. Because The day you came to work with us at 
Grey Fords house (best friend), i saw a different look in your eyes, and I don’t know why but I was giddy. 
I was so happy that even Ian was smiling so happily. I’ve only told him part of this. Then I had a dream that night, and Ian was with a woman, kissing her, and I was okay with it. He was with you. 
I woke up the next day in tears, and I knew why. I had fallen out of love with him, and fallen in love with you. 
Now I know this may sound weird, but I’m not telling you this because I want a chance with you. I realized you were brought into my life for a reason. You helped me realize that this world has more to offer and I shouldn’t settle with being unhappy. When you ghosted me, you also made me realize that i never want a fake friendship or relationship again. You gave me the courage to walk away. Thank you for helping me. 
The truth is, you can be with someone and be so lonely, alienated from the world. 
Hope we can be friends

1jg28p9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1jg28p9/sister_taking_money_from_me/,Sister taking money from me?,"**TLDR;** My sister is in her youth, and we (parents and me) suspect she is taking money from me (teen). What should I do about it?

Lately my sister has been talking a lot more about money, as she and her friend(s) get into walking around the neighborhood, and spending money on their own. They go to coffee shops, etc. When I was about her age, I did the same thing, so it's not really a concern. 

What is a concern is that she might be taking money from me. I worry that she may be having the same feelings as I did when I was also around her age, which was I wanted to spend time with my friends, and our way of bonding was going out and buying candy or cookies. Healthy, mostly. The problem was, I was not very mindful with my own spending, so I quickly depleted the small amount of cash I had. Due to this, I took small increments of money out of my parents' wallets when I needed it to spend time with my friends. Eventually, after being caught, my parents forced me to pay them back over the next few years. Mostly out of trying to help me understand the value of money, we aren't really restricted by that, thankfully.   
I'm worried that she has been taking money from me due to my experiences with that in the past, and also noticing that my cash box seemed a little depleted. May have been my fault, but since my incident many years ago, I've stopped spending significant increments of money, and somewhat keep track of my money.

*The following statement may have been a mistake on my part.* I took a look inside her wallet, and realized that she had multiple $20 bills, but her main source of 'income' is lemonade stands in the summer, and she only trades for $5's from my parents. This made me more suspicious, but now I'm realizing I don't know how to approach her about this.

The main issue that probably also needs solving is that whenever she is confronted about anything remotely bad, she immediately locks up and stops accepting feedback, responding with only screaming and crying. This makes it nearly impossible to get a message across, regardless of our (parents and me) intentions.

I told my parents about my suspicions and they said just to move the cash box into a more hidden location, but I think that I should at least try to help her understand why she shouldn't take money from me.

I'm not personally worried about my money, but I just don't want this to extend farther, as mine did in the past.",1,1742511410.0,AskParents,6,1.0,False
