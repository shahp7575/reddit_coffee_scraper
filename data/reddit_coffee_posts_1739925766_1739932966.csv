1isuvow,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1isuvow,Matching coffee table and tv console?,"We are finally replacing our dinky apartment furniture with something that fits our home! But I am having the hardest time finding furniture that fits all of our checklist.

The biggest blocker is that my wife has become adamant that the TV console and coffee table match exactly. Since there’s no way other to guarantee that, this means we probably have to get a matched set. 

Yes, I know the trend right now is to not get matched furniture. No, shades that are close are not good enough. This has become non-negotiable. I suggested that we get black furniture so we can be sure it matches, and she’s worried they “won’t be the same black.” She also doesn’t like glass or metal. They must both be wood, and the wood must be the exact same color. 

This would be okay, but we have two other (more practical, IMO) must-haves:
- The coffee table must have wheels, or be light enough for one of us to easily move alone. We’ll move it out of the way 3x a week to do yoga.

- The coffee table can’t be bigger than 48” long. Bigger than that, and it’s longer than the couch.

- We eat on the couch most lunches, so practically speaking, a rectangle is the best shape.

A furniture set that checks all these boxes just doesn’t seem to exist. I’m losing my mind. We are having increasingly stupid fights about it.

This is half “is there something/somewhere I can be looking that will make this hunt easier,” and half vent post, I guess. Any suggestions are very welcome!",1,1739932903.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1isuuiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1isuuiu/i_love_being_autistic/,I love being autistic,"I really like being autistic. And I don't mean it in the sense of the diagnosis, the paperwork or anything else. I mean it in the way that my brain works.

I am very sensitive to many things, like touch textures, the materials of things, clothing, food textures, smells (lingering or long lasting smells), the way my food is prepared, the exact amount of ingredients and the level to which it's cooked. I'm sensitive to the time of the day when I have to do things, and I am very affected by sudden plans or obligations.

When I used to live in a place where I had no freedom or control over things, all of that would be a source of distress. Being forced to deal with clothes I hated, having to eat food that I didn't like, being always worried about how moldy or dirty things in the fridge would get aroudn my food. They wouldn't buy the correct type of milk, or they would change the brand of cereal without asking.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

But then I moved out and went to live with my now roommate, who is also autistic.

We made sure to create a life and a world according to how **\*we\*** want to live. We have lots of fluffy things, because I like how they feel. We have lots of colorful things, because she likes colors.

We buy the correct type of cereal, and discuss about why we choose each particular brand of cocoa, and compare the taste of all the types we can find until we find the best one for us.

We try to remember each other's preferences in food, and if we forget **\*we ask\*** the other. *Was it a lot of sugar, or a bit of sugar with this particualr flavor? Do you prefer chocolate or coffee with this cake?*

I spend hours researching the best kind of blender we can buy to get the best smoothies. She learns about fabrics and threads and clothes. I pick the oven with alot of excitement. She picks the pots and kettles we will use. We collect and share mugs.

We don't go out of our home unless we want to go out, and we don't accept plans unless we are given several days of avance notice.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

I was thinking all of this because of a post I replied to yesterday, where I said that I love how much I care about things that others would find inconsequential.

""I care and pay a lot of attention to all the details that non-autistics don't notice at all. I know the patterns of the spiders that live with me. I can communicate really well with most mammals. I live with a lot of plushies that are as important as a pet or family member for me. I know the difference between a quarter teaspoon of sugar in my cold choco milk and a half spoon. I notice the vibration of the elevators in my building. I feel the wind and humidity in the air to predict rain. I can tell the difference between cooking bread with butter or lard, and putting the butter early or late in the process.​""



I really feel grateful that I have a brain that can focus, no, that HAS to focus on so many details all the time. Every single thing becomes a really big deal with me. And that is great, when every little thing is good.

There's a lot more I would like to say, but this is probably enough to show what I mean. **Because** I am autistic is that I can enjoy all the details in life that others wouldn't care at all about.

  
\----------------------------------------------------------------

I know that being autistic comes with a lot of disabilities and other difficulties. I have some of those as well. And I know that many have very very bad difficulties, or others don't have the possibility of shaping hteir own world to fit them.

But I also know that there are some who have good families, and don't suffer abuse. Some that have good amounts of support and are able to face life with less difficulties.

I'm not in either of those groups (I'm not gonna get into it today), but let's not forget or invalidate either side. Autism doesn't have to suck, and most of the time it's not even autism's fault. It's either non autistic people making it hard for us with no reason, or it's other comorbidities like depression. Or sometimes, having unhealthy expectations for what 'life', 'success' or 'happiness' have to include. I am open to share my point of view on these things as well!



But autism is the reason I can have a happy life, and for many of us that possibility has always been there, but nobody told us. So let's also share the good side, all the reasons to be proud of being autistic!",1,1739932807.0,autism,2,1.0,False

My name is Jacob! I’m planning to move from Virginia to NYC this autumn to attend school at John Jay school of criminal Justice in Midtown. I have so many questions and really need some help. 

After visiting the city for the past 2 days, I’ve absolutely fallen in love with it and am really eager to move here. My two favorite spots have to be Armore Pizza on the corner of W 58th and 9th and Dark Matter Coffee on the east side. Both the guys there gave me some advice but I’m still looking for a bit more. 

1) How far of a commute is too far of a commute and is it worth living in the outer Burroughs and commuting an hour or more into the city proper once or twice a week for school? 

2) obviously it’s a huge city, but where do I meet people? I’ve always been a loner but moving into this city, I feel like I should always walk with at least one other person. Where would you recommend I go to meet and interact with new friendly faces? 

3) How the hell am I supposed to afford midtown/manhattan housing without dropping ≈10k a semester? Is there more affordable apartments that I’m missing in the $800-1000 a month range? 

4) moving into the city from out of state, what are some of the biggest things I’ll need to adjust to? And what should I be prepared for?

it seems like every program i would have to go down in dose or pay over 400 dollars to start at 7.5. Why? can't I just upload my script and start there? I understand 7.5 costs more. Can anyone give me a recommendation for somewhere I can start at 7.5 and the BUD is extended so I can stock up?

And the thing is, I never felt satisfied while doing it, always had to be more puffs. 

Long story short I also grew up being an athlete and I fear what this crap is doing to me as I age. Plus it’s a waste of money and just generally stupid (sitting around breathing flavoured air lol)

--->""everything we offer is carefully curated to share the magic of Hawaii with the world."" 

In hindsight, it's obvious & quite intentional. They were careful what they wrote to make the buyer ASSUME the  product was made in Hawaii, without ever explicitly making that claim.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Please be wary to take this stuff slowly and separate from one another, but it’s all natural supplements and it’s also kept me in extraordinarily good health.

1. Ashwaghanda (as much as possible later in the day after your cortisol has spiked from sunlight)
2. Vitamin D or sunlight early in the morning 
3. Testosterone supplements containing tongkat Ali
4. Pre workout containing beta alanine to spike adrenaline 
5. Alpha brain

7. Ryze mushroom coffee, especially for lion’s mane and make sure it contains lion’s mane mushrooms
8. Extra strength melatonin from target containing L-theanine
9. 4 eggs a day
10. BCAA + EAA combination to maintain protein in body

Working out and taking creatine is also important, and making sure to get a gram of protein per pound of body weight. Remember these supplements will guard you against brain fog but it’s important to build your resolve over time as well. As Nietzsche said, “you must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame.” Make sure to guard yourself against life and never let it break you.

 I’ve been doing some work in therapy and we have come to the conclusion I have some power and control “issues”(I put “ because I’m not quite sure what to call them, maybe tendencies,?). Aswell as some rejection insecurities.

And I thought well this is a situation I am not able to control as I have no right to, and it’s ultimately not up to me. Not that you are just an opportunity, or a chess piece in a game. I also am not expecting to be given forgiveness, or apologies for the past. 

It’s been a few years, so I was wondering if someday we could meet up? Doesn’t have to be this month or heck, even this year. And I do have some wants/ needs if we ever do meet up. If we could meet in a neutral accessible setting, like a coffee shop/ bubble tea shop, book store, or even park. Just not a house. Masking would be great and preferred. A covid test taken before meeting. I also would be uncomfortable with any physical affection, hug, handshake ext. If we buy anything, we buy it for ourselves. Topics to stay away from, blood family, romantic/ sexual relationships, trauma dumping (therapy is so great for that one lol), any others you want to add to that let me know. I would like to keep communication to email and to a minimum until we figure out how we feel. No following on social media, no regular texting/ calling. Again until we actually know rather more, if that is the route we chose. As it is like meeting a stranger for the first time all over again.

Not like you do me but in the opposite trajectory I’m sorry I was so consumed
I never should have assumed 
Now I see what you meant and I am sorry it took all this, I’ll continue to do the plan and if you ever need a safe place to land..
My chest can be your home, I’ll do everything that I failed to do, and you will consistently see what I whisper sweetly.
I apologize dear for not loving you right, I put it all in my own language and how I wish I could translate it so you could see you’re a part of the very depths of me
This winters gotten colder so I’ll keep you close even though it hurts, I’ll let you go for you, but for me you’ll always be my veins my blood and bone. 
I never lied about the feelings I just didn’t show them the way you could see them and now I feel blind 
I’ll always be waiting no sense in lying this time
But if you return I’ll be ready to love you to your heartbeats melody and not my rhyme

1isug5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1isug5d/im_about_to_fire_my_baristas/,Im about to “fire” my baristas,"I work for a SBUX inside a grocery store, which i consider low maintenance starbucks’ because of near lack of regulation. They have been looking for a manager because the previous one retired last month, even though Ive been here for 2 years I dont want to become it because Im not that knowledgeable about being lead and didnt have proper training. Plus I do online college. Ever since she left tho Ive been having problems with my team

They’re pretty new, 5 baristas. Second to me got hired 6 months ago and last hire came 2 months ago, all no experience. They’re all certified now, but with my manager gone Im running into a bit of problems sorta like regression. 

It all started last inventory I did, where we had a troublesome sales:purchase ratio. it was low which is concerning. The purchases being high where the sales is low. And those following days I reviewed our customer connection being at 20% score 🙁

So I took an initiative to investigate because this regression is pretty worrisome. I did things like took on more mid shifts so i can work with morning and night people, came in on my off days to spy, called the phone to make sure they were cleaning, telling other dept supervisors to comment if they were doing nothing or the lobby/seating was dirty. 

And now after that, I am honestly so over it.

Before I start, my manager let people get one grande drink for free  (Store policy says we have to pay for items) but we have to pay for food.

I found out recently, some baristas were taking eod food home ( before close).

Closers were seen taking full trays of drinks home, and bags of anything

A barista was under pricing drinks for his friends, giving away free drinks to other store associates even for discounts. Infront of me he charged for an ice water, but gave a venti strawberry acai lemonade to a online shopper. 

Customers were coming back during my shift with complaints of bad service, nonchalantness, old coffee, previous day drinks. 

Supervisors and other managers telling me that the seating area is often dirty with baristas doing nothing. 

I got with another department manager to view cam footage and what the fuck. THEYRE ON THEIR PHONES AT TIMES WHEN TASKS NEED TO BE DONE WTFFF 

And it killed me not to say anything to the store director and my OP because If they got fired I couldnt handle having to work 15 hour shifts everyday to rebuild my team of new hires. Me and my manager went thru it because my store director was being too cheep to hire someone in time. 

Last Sunday I had a meeting, about it. Deadnamed everyone and the issued that followed each of them. I did it in a polite manner to where I wasn’t aggressive. I told them straight up what would happen and how I need them to be better. It seemed like I spooked them. Theyve been a bit better this week. 

I contacted my old manager and she told me tell the Store director. Most likely they be fired over theft along with the other associated who got freebies. And I would have to work 40+ hours, but I would have support from employees from Other stores. Im not sure what thats called.

A group of people arrived, a man and a woman opened a backpack and took a big flag of China and started waving it and walking in circles around the monument. A couple of minutes after some police started following them (it would have been faster going in the other direction than following them but i digress...). When they reached them they stopped them and obviously told them not to do whatever they were doing. Mind you: they were just walking and waving the Chinese flag.

The woman threw a tantrum and starting waving flag even more aggressively, police tried to follow her but she was walking fast. After half a turn her male friend reached her and talked her out of it. Then she proceeded to show her respects to the monument (kind of bowing to it) and then put the flag back.

Then they rejoined their group, started taking selfies and at some point a woman sellikg touristic trips information came and they casually went away.

1isufoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1isufoo/left_her_for_her_own_good_or_so_i_think/,Left her for her own good. (Or so I think),"This is a fast paced story, in this side you have me:

>Finally getting over his ex, after years
>Open to try new things
>Scared of new relationships but willing to commit to someone.
>Someone who deeply cares to not make mistakes from the past, trying to be responsable with his new partners.

Then, you have her: 

>Insecure, gets high hopes about me really easy
>She doesn't love herself
>Not an experienced lover (thinks more in her benefit rather than both of us)
>But she loved me like a child, purely, intensely, she tought I was perfect

Total duration of the ""relationship"": 3 weeks 

Since the beginning I was clear to her, ""Don't get too excited about me, I'm not looking to hurt you, but don't expect me to get into a relationship too quickly, I need my time"" 

She agreed, but couldn't control her feelings, by one week she was completely obsessed, and in my attempt to not hurt her and be responsible, I left myself loose, I thought. ""And what's so scary about a relationship anyways?, she's completely into me, maybe I should fall for her too, she deserves it.""

I had my doubts during this 3 long weeks, but I left them aside in the name of love, in the name of giving her what I think she deserved (a true love), because the way she was into me, was really magical, thought it was a gift from God himself.

But then disaster struck, I've been cheated before, and that's a trauma, a weakness of mine, this Saturday she went to a coffee shop with a guy and a friend who was a woman, all day, no messages, no way to contact her until the night. She texts, everything ""fine"", no further explanations, but then she can't stop herself from telling me how much she likes me, how much she missed me, then, the guilt:

""My friend didn't come, I was with the guy the entire time, but don't misunderstand this, I didn't anything with him""

I was upset, heartbroken, and I fell from the clouds, couldn't see her with love eyes anymore. Then realized, dude, it was only 3 weeks!, I don't know who she is, but I'm thinking of her as my girlfriend already, and she does the same thing with me.

So I did the sane thing and got myself apart from her, but then she tried to manipulate me and showed that in her insecurity she was already filling emotional holes with my love. 

""Don't do this, don't leave me, I need you, I'll never meet someone like you again, you are all I have"" 

And man, only 3 weeks but I was willing to take it very far, I confess I'm in love with her, but those red flags I mentioned earlier... As a experienced man I know is not any good to stay there, but... I really want to. Even if it is irrational and stupid 

That's why I think I left her for her own good, because she has demonstrated her love in a very beautiful way, but is not sane, not for me, not for her too, once her illusion broke, and her insecurities kicked in, we would've been in a lot of trouble

But I want to comeback (I know I must stand my ground, is the most sane and responsible thing to do), I want to be there, I feel guilty, and I miss her very much... Too fast, too intense, f*k ",1,1739931619.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Surprise! It was pre-recorded, leaving us all raising our eyebrows and shaking our heads. Talk about a scandal brewing that’s hotter than my morning coffee!

Last night, there was a flurry of excitement when LIBRA saw a brief recovery, only to crash and lose over $100 million in market cap today. Ouch, that’s gotta sting! It seems like Milei’s attempt to regain trust in his political project isn’t quite hitting the mark, and the drama is far from over. With Argentina’s sovereign bonds under pressure, investors are sweating bullets.

Milei’s interview was supposed to clear the air, but it turns out that his team was pulling the strings behind the scenes. They picked the questions and edited the juicy bits out. As if his attempts to distance himself from the LIBRA pump-and-dump weren’t enough, he straight-up misled everyone by pretending this was all unscripted. And now, with the crypto community buzzing, people are left wondering if they were played.

And let’s not forget the serious issues this whole mess is causing; political pressure is mounting as calls for impeachment grow louder. Even the crypto space isn't immune to this chaos. With soaring stakes, we could see some real tremors in Argentina’s economy. So, keep an eye on those charts, folks!

Get ready to strap in, crypto enthusiasts. We’re in for a bumpy ride with LIBRA and Milei's fragile credibility. This saga isn’t wrapped up just yet, so grab your popcorn and stay updated!

And if you're anything like me, your first reaction was probably something between """" and ""wait... *what*?"".

Because let's be honest, it messes with your head a little, right? Art used to be, like, *people*. Paintbrushes, clay, cameras – human hands translating human feelings. Now? We’ve got algorithms spitting out masterpieces (and yeah, let’s call some of it masterpieces) in seconds. It’s exciting, it’s kinda terrifying, and it definitely throws a whole bunch of ethical and artistic curveballs our way.

Think about it – you're probably seeing this stuff on Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, maybe even TikTok (the AI art dance is probably already a thing, let's be real). Like that mind-blowing stuff you see blowing up all over art-focused corners of Reddit, showing off these images that bend reality. It's not just a niche thing anymore; it’s mainstream. And that’s why we NEED to talk about it – not just about how cool it looks, but about what it *means*.

**The Ethics Download: Where Things Get… Complicated (Fast)**

Alright, let’s dive into the stuff that keeps me (and probably should keep you) up at night when it comes to AI art. It's not all rainbows and algorithmically generated unicorns.

* **Copyright Chaos: Who Gets to Own the Digital Mona Lisa?** Imagine you prompt an AI with ""Van Gogh on acid painting a cyberpunk cityscape."" Boom. Stunning image. But… who owns it? You, for the prompt? The AI company? Van Gogh’s ghost? (Okay, maybe not the ghost). But seriously, current copyright laws are basically face-palming right now. They're not built for this. This creates a massive gray area. Artists worry about their styles being ripped off, creators are unsure about selling AI art, and it's all just a big legal head-scratch. We’re in digital copyright no-man’s-land.
* **Artist Apocalypse… or Just a Really Annoying Coworker? Job Security in the Age of Algorithms.** Okay, ""apocalypse"" might be dramatic, but the fear is real. Will AI art tools replace human artists? Probably not *entirely*. But could companies start using cheaper AI visuals instead of hiring illustrators? Absolutely. Especially for things like marketing materials or stock images. It’s not about AI destroying art, but it *could* reshape the art market in ways that hurt working artists, especially those just starting out. We need to think about how to support human creativity in a world where robots can paint pretty pictures on demand. Maybe it's about emphasizing the *human story* behind art, the unique perspective, the emotional depth that (for now, at least) only humans can bring.
* **Data Dirt and Algorithmic Bias: Garbage In, Garbage Art?** AI learns from *data*. Massive amounts of it, scraped from the internet. And guess what? The internet isn't exactly a perfectly fair and unbiased place. So, if the data used to train an AI is skewed (and it probably is), the art it produces will likely reflect those biases. Think about representation in art history, or stereotypes. If the training data is full of it, the AI art could perpetuate it. Plus, there are serious privacy questions. Are artists' works being used without permission? Are *your* images in those datasets? We need to demand transparency about the data powering these tools and fight against perpetuating biases in AI-generated art.
* **Soul vs. Silicon: Is AI Art…** ***Really*** **Art, Though?** Okay, philosophical time. Does AI art have soul? Intent? Meaning? Or is it just a really good parrot, mimicking styles without understanding? Some say it’s just fancy imitation, lacking the lived experience and emotional depth of human art. Others argue that AI is just a *new medium*, like photography or digital art, that expands what art can be. Maybe the point isn't *who* or *what* made it, but how it *makes us feel*. Does it move you? Does it make you think? Does it spark something? If yes, maybe that’s enough to call it art, regardless of the creator. This debate is *fierce* online, and honestly, there's no right answer, just a lot of passionate opinions.

**Artistic Awesome-Sauce: Where AI Gets Seriously Cool**

Okay, ethics lesson over (for now!). Let’s flip to the amazing stuff, because there’s a LOT of it. AI art isn’t just ethically challenging; it’s artistically revolutionary.

* **Art for the People! Democratizing Creativity Like Never Before.** Suddenly, you don’t need to be Picasso to make something visually stunning. Want to see what your cat would look like as a medieval knight? Dream of painting an alien sunset but can barely draw a stick figure? AI art tools are your new best friend. They make artistic expression accessible to *everyone*. This is HUGE. Imagine kids in classrooms, people with disabilities, anyone with an idea suddenly able to visualize it in incredible detail. It’s art for the masses, breaking down barriers and unleashing creativity in places we never expected. Think of the explosion of visual communication and personal expression this unlocks!
* **Human + Machine: The Ultimate Creative Power Couple.** Forget ""AI replacing artists."" Think ""AI *empowering* artists."" Imagine AI as your super-powered art assistant. Need to brainstorm a hundred character designs? AI can do it in minutes. Stuck in a creative rut? Let AI generate variations on your ideas to spark new directions. It’s a collaboration, a partnership. Artists can use AI to push their boundaries, overcome creative blocks, and experiment in ways that were impossible before. This is where the real magic happens – human vision amplified by algorithmic power.
* **Exploring New Dimensions of Art: Into the Algorithmic Unknown.** AI can create art in styles and forms we literally couldn't imagine. It can explore artistic spaces we haven’t even conceptualized yet. It's like opening a door to a whole new wing of the art museum, filled with things we've never seen before. This is where art gets truly mind-bending. AI can challenge our aesthetic preconceptions, surprise us with unexpected beauty, and redefine what we even consider ""art"" to be. It's artistic exploration on steroids.
* **Turbocharging Traditional Art: Efficiency and Innovation in Existing Fields.** AI isn't just about wild, abstract AI-generated craziness. It can also supercharge traditional art forms. Architects using AI to design buildings, fashion designers using it to create fabric patterns, filmmakers using it for mind-blowing visual effects – AI is becoming a powerful tool across all creative disciplines. It can automate tedious tasks, boost efficiency, and unlock new creative avenues within established art forms, freeing up human artists to focus on the big picture, the core vision.

**Real Talk Time: See It To Believe It**

Words can only do so much. To really *get* AI art, you gotta see it. Remember those crazy examples popping up all over online art communities? They're packed with examples. But for something truly mind-blowing, check out the work of **Refik Anadol**. His ""[Unsupervised](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.refikanadol.com/works/unsupervised/)"" project is like stepping into a data-driven dream. It's not just an image; it's a constantly shifting experience, generated by AI trained on art history. It’s both technically stunning and emotionally impactful, proof that AI art can be deeply meaningful and not just visually impressive.

**Refik Anadol's ""Unsupervised"" Project:** [https://www.refikanadol.com/works/unsupervised/](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.refikanadol.com/works/unsupervised/)

**The Algorithm and Us: Let's Keep Talking**

AI art is here to stay. It’s evolving faster than we can probably even imagine. We’re at the ground floor of something HUGE, and honestly, nobody really knows where it’s going. It’s exciting, it’s uncertain, and it demands a conversation.

We need to keep asking these tough ethical questions, support human artists in this evolving landscape, and embrace the mind-blowing creative potential that AI offers. Maybe AI art will force us to redefine what art *is*, what creativity *means*, and what the future of art looks like in a world increasingly shaped by algorithms. Buckle up, folks. It’s going to be a wild ride.

Think about representation in art history, or stereotypes. If the training data is full of it, the AI art could perpetuate it. Plus, there are serious privacy questions. Are artists' works being used without permission? Are *your* images in those datasets? We need to demand transparency about the data powering these tools and fight against perpetuating biases in AI-generated art.
* **Soul vs. Silicon: Is AI Art…** ***Really*** **Art, Though?** Okay, philosophical time. Does AI art have soul? Intent? Meaning? Or is it just a really good parrot, mimicking styles without understanding? Some say it’s just fancy imitation, lacking the lived experience and emotional depth of human art. Others argue that AI is just a *new medium*, like photography or digital art, that expands what art can be. Maybe the point isn't *who* or *what* made it, but how it *makes us feel*. Does it move you? Does it make you think? Does it spark something? If yes, maybe that’s enough to call it art, regardless of the creator. This debate is *fierce* online, and honestly, there's no right answer, just a lot of passionate opinions.

**Artistic Awesome-Sauce: Where AI Gets Seriously Cool**

Okay, ethics lesson over (for now!). Let’s flip to the amazing stuff, because there’s a LOT of it. AI art isn’t just ethically challenging; it’s artistically revolutionary.

* **Art for the People! Democratizing Creativity Like Never Before.** Suddenly, you don’t need to be Picasso to make something visually stunning. Want to see what your cat would look like as a medieval knight? Dream of painting an alien sunset but can barely draw a stick figure? AI art tools are your new best friend. They make artistic expression accessible to *everyone*. This is HUGE. Imagine kids in classrooms, people with disabilities, anyone with an idea suddenly able to visualize it in incredible detail. It’s art for the masses, breaking down barriers and unleashing creativity in places we never expected. Think of the explosion of visual communication and personal expression this unlocks!
* **Human + Machine: The Ultimate Creative Power Couple.** Forget ""AI replacing artists."" Think ""AI *empowering* artists."" Imagine AI as your super-powered art assistant. Need to brainstorm a hundred character designs? AI can do it in minutes. Stuck in a creative rut? Let AI generate variations on your ideas to spark new directions. It’s a collaboration, a partnership. Artists can use AI to push their boundaries, overcome creative blocks, and experiment in ways that were impossible before. This is where the real magic happens – human vision amplified by algorithmic power.
* **Exploring New Dimensions of Art: Into the Algorithmic Unknown.** AI can create art in styles and forms we literally couldn't imagine. It can explore artistic spaces we haven’t even conceptualized yet. It's like opening a door to a whole new wing of the art museum, filled with things we've never seen before. This is where art gets truly mind-bending. AI can challenge our aesthetic preconceptions, surprise us with unexpected beauty, and redefine what we even consider ""art"" to be. It's artistic exploration on steroids.
* **Turbocharging Traditional Art: Efficiency and Innovation in Existing Fields.** AI isn't just about wild, abstract AI-generated craziness. It can also supercharge traditional art forms. Architects using AI to design buildings, fashion designers using it to create fabric patterns, filmmakers using it for mind-blowing visual effects – AI is becoming a powerful tool across all creative disciplines. It can automate tedious tasks, boost efficiency, and unlock new creative avenues within established art forms, freeing up human artists to focus on the big picture, the core vision.

**Real Talk Time: See It To Believe It**

Words can only do so much. To really *get* AI art, you gotta see it. Remember those crazy examples popping up all over online art communities? They're packed with examples. But for something truly mind-blowing, check out the work of **Refik Anadol**. His ""[Unsupervised](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.refikanadol.com/works/unsupervised/)"" project is like stepping into a data-driven dream. It's not just an image; it's a constantly shifting experience, generated by AI trained on art history. It’s both technically stunning and emotionally impactful, proof that AI art can be deeply meaningful and not just visually impressive.

**The Algorithm and Us: Let's Keep Talking**

AI art is here to stay. It’s evolving faster than we can probably even imagine. We’re at the ground floor of something HUGE, and honestly, nobody really knows where it’s going. It’s exciting, it’s uncertain, and it demands a conversation.

We need to keep asking these tough ethical questions, support human artists in this evolving landscape, and embrace the mind-blowing creative potential that AI offers. Maybe AI art will force us to redefine what art *is*, what creativity *means*, and what the future of art looks like in a world increasingly shaped by algorithms. Buckle up, folks. It’s going to be a wild ride.

People, especially trusted mentors, told me I'm lazy. I've eaten that up. I believed I am lazy. And yesterday I hit my rock bottom. I am close to termination yet sleep is still what I want to do.

My partner, whom I believe is my biggest miracle, came. I actually chose to shut him out since I know this cycle of mine. He'll be in hell if he stays with me. But he chose to swoop me from my room and told me he'd listen. He always did, so I tried my luck by telling him my truth. It is a long standing problem that people told me to ""just fight it off.""

Before you and ma got separated, you always believed me. Now I don't have you. You are choosing that other life with your other family for almost 10 years now. But God isn't asleep, no?

Dad, my partner listened and held me. I cried my entire decade. I told him how scared I was for his reaction. Then we prayed, got coffee from a place we both don't know, we talked for what seemed like hours, went home. And for the first time!!! I openly asked for help to clean my room. I was worried he'll be turned off... but, we've done half of it and he went home for he is tired of taking care of me. He spent his day off with a wild adventure with me. I asked what if I got laid off? ""Life must go on and I'd still be here."" I got the courage and will to live again, da!

I still hate you tho. And I wanna share, I found someone of your opposite. I am beyond blessed. I may be out of job for the next few months, but I am in schedule for therapy this month, have someone who believes in me. Let the professionals tell me if I am lazy. For people have always told me, ""your potential is going to waste if you choose to be lazy all the time."" I know, that's what I am feeling too. I know my potentials!!

Yet still, I am here... da, as I am waiting my therapy, what else can I do to improve my situation? Can you enlighten some steps I can take, please? And... are you proud of me?",3,1739930816.0,DadForAMinute,0,1.0,False

I want to just not care anymore.,"This is my first time writing anything on here so bare with my lengthy post and rambling. To preface- we “officially” broke up 7 months ago (I walked away after feeling like my ex didn’t want me). Things were amicable and a lot of love was there but I didn’t feel chosen. I’ve also never been the one to break up with someone, I’ve always been broken up with- so it was hard but a proud moment for me I guess. I said I’d be open to see where we were at in time if we came back to it and if things had changed but I couldn’t be with someone who had this uncertainty about me. 

I asked for space and time to just figure things out and have a sense of certainty for what my love life could look like. My ex wasn’t great at respecting the boundaries. They’d send me memes or say things like “I’m sorry I’m struggling to be your ex but I just needed to tell you ___”. They would flirt with me or send  reminders of me and us (pictures, things they’d see in the street ect.) In all honesty, I struggled to hold these boundaries of NC- I was in love and wanted this effort and attention that I was getting during the breakup, throughout our relationship. We hooked up twice and I’d reach back out to them in response to the sweet things they’d say to me. Of course there was this cat and mouse dynamic and us being in limbo for a while. Multiple times my ex asked if we could “take things slow” or just start over to some extent. As conflicted as I was and as much as I deep down wanted that- I still chose to not run back- I didn’t trust that anything changed (boy was I right)

Fast forward a few months later and I’ve become open to the idea to maybe “take things slow”. I talked to some people casually and even had a little fling with someone but nothing too intense because my ex was always lingering somewhere somehow. But then maybe within a week, I could feel a shift from them- like there was a 180 in the way that they would speak to me when we did speak. They did reach out less and respond more neutrally. I tried to take a step back and not do the most because I was confused by their shift and also we weren’t together so I felt like I had no right anyway. Around month 5, we have a mutual friend who is visiting and our friend split her time between the two of us. I dropped my friend off near my ex’s house one day and I got to see my ex and connect for a bit. They were very flirty and touchy, and we even kissed. They UNPROVOKED said they “missed me and would write about it every week”. Shortly after that I reached out to finally just see what the fuck we were doing before going into the new year with this limbo state. My ex said “let’s check back in a month”. 

Now comes the last time we spoke: we met for coffee in person and I said how I was open to taking things slow (like they suggested a few times before) and they basically just said they couldn’t do that. They said it wasn’t “right” for them to do that in the moment. After months of telling me “who cares about right and wrong just do what feels good and follow your heart”. They suggested we mutually block one another on socials and actually follow NC. I didn’t resist but I did tell them part of me was still invested in figuring this out. They said a lot of things to soften the blow: “maybe in time” “we were never friends beforehand” “maybe we were meant to be friends all along”. And then we “amicably” parted ways. 

Maybe a week or two later I find out they’ve been seeing someone. It’s not casual. They brought this person home for the holidays, brought them around all their closest family and friends. Worst of all is I found out they’ve went on a fucking vacation together to my HOME COUNTRY. All within a month of that last convo and within 2 months of us kissing and them saying all the fluffy shit to me. I’ve been an absolute mess because I was so blindsided and they didn’t have the decency to tell me. 

We always said we’d be transparent and honest with one another even if it hurt or was difficult. I was transparent with them when I was talking to that other person over the summer, I was always honest and open about where I stood, but they couldn’t give me that decency. When I NEEDED the boundaries and space and time to move on- I didn’t get that luxury. But now that it’s aligning with their timeline and life, they want me to give them what they never gave me- the chance to let go and move on. 

It takes everything in me to not reach out and curse them for using my time and energy to their convenience. It’s so hard to not rage because all I want is for them to feel my pain. For them to know they were so selfish up until the very end and still didn’t choose me. I know I should only be mad at myself for putting myself in this position but it’s hell. I don’t wanna compare myself to their new picture perfect life. I don’t wanna feel like I wasn’t enough. I don’t wanna think about them or the good times as petty as that is. I just want to not care anymore.  ",2,1739930053.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1istv1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1istv1h/all_the_bad_bonnet/,[All] The bad bonnet,"In P6, when Albert stepped into a bar and walked slowly through the crowd, a carefully orchestrated parade of abstractions seems to have accompanied him. One such abstraction would have been the lady *waiting* for a table, [suggesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1ioyt4h/all_tin_man/) the place was actually the *waiting* room in the Black Lodge.

[In the waiting room.](https://preview.redd.it/w32la5n210ke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51cbfd81a7f8fdba90ded12125d2c3305df3426e)

In Return, the Black Lodge and especially its waiting room seem to have been utilised as a rationale for a very tough to follow storytelling device: once in the Lodge, the characters were abruptly moving from one dreamlike illusion to another, each having the appearance of a different story. Living inside a dream, people stuck in the lodge kept moving from one life to another and adopting new identities, in each forgetting whom they were and believing to be someone else entirely. At the same time, their fates in these new lives would have echoed their overall fates, thus advancing the underlying plot.

Lurking among the human characters, there would also have been supernatural Lodge entities who remained aware of the situation across different stories. Yet, also they may have changed their appearance and identity from one illusion to another.

Complicating matters, as it seems, when one got tossed from one story to another, they didn't necessarily become another person. For example, preceding the scene in the bar, [this Albert would have been a tin bucket](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1inp4ui/all_the_evolution_of_the_arm/) at the door in another likely Black Lodge illusion, the Buckhorn morgue. As the morgue's waiting room would have transformed into the bar, he would - at least briefly - have been back to himself, now walking to have a word with Diane who had stayed behind waiting for something, possibly Albert himself after another Albert left the room.

When Albert appeared at the bar's door, he was framed together with two men on the left. One had a black hat. The other lifted his hand and appeared to point at the hat.

[ It's about those shooting targets.](https://preview.redd.it/bxkx0iql10ke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb4619c967d5515aa3a371352695f0a0a38b92a3)

Behind the hat, there was a poster on the wall. It listed localities that had [major Civil War battles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_Civil_War_battles), such as Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville and White Oak. This was in likely throwback to second season episodes E19 through E22 when Ben Horne had a nervous breakdown, believing himself to be Robert E. Lee who led the Confederate troops.

A black hat in front of a Civil War poster would be quite intentional. ""The Black Hats"" was a nickname for the [Iron Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Brigade), a Union Army infantry unit that existed 1861-6, coinciding with Lincoln's presidency.

The purpose in this would have been to create an association to another gun related poster on the left side of another door. In Carl's trailer park, Steven and Becky's trailer had an air rifle target hanging on the wall. While the Black Hats were shooting targets in the Civil War, this poster was a shooting target.

Drawn on the target, there was *a shadow-like torso of a man*. Seen from the angle in the bar, also the black hat in front of the Civil War battle poster resembled the shadow of a man's torso.

The shooting target on the trailer wall was seen multiple times in P10, P11 and P15. How could Albert's barwalk and Carl's trailer park connect to each other? As seems the typical storytelling trick in Return, a third scene would need to be added to the mix to start making more sense of the story.

[That's where he would hit his head on.](https://preview.redd.it/fbd440b520ke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a6506fcf9ced841ce9e6469c064f4637f5c880a)

When Albert continued his walk through the bar crowd, he got to a large blackboard that had a lot of writing on it. A section of the board had the text split in alternating green and white paragraphs, giving it the rough *likeness of a pedestrian zebra crossing*. Albert's head was briefly right over the white lines.

When Albert then found Diane and stopped, he leaned on a *pole* with his left hand, holding his *umbrella* in the right. Later in the episode, a little boy stopped in front of a pedestrian crossing, another kind of set of white lines. To his left, there was the mysterious *pole number 6* and to his right *a STOP sign*. Both the sign and Albert's umbrella having an [octagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octagon) outline, it was suggested that even if the environments were seemingly so different, **the tragic little boy was Albert** and [the scene in the crossroads in direct continuation of the scene in the bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1ioyt4h/all_tin_man/). This would then mean that Albert was killed in the bar - or rather, he was killed in the Black Lodge waiting room that now doubled as the crossroads.

[He stopped between a pole and an octagon.](https://preview.redd.it/tnu0oaij20ke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2b9ed9f51955fd5bc0bfe499172b9d6d648a8e2)

A likely further conclusion is that the nameless mother running to the boy and giving him a loving hug was Diane from the bar, in stark contrast to the open hostility between her and Albert throughout the season. As it seems, [the story also featured Albert's doppelganger](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1ioyt4h/all_tin_man/) who was the one with an openly contentious relationship with Diane.

In P11, there was another scene with an agitated and reckless lone driver hurting another person. When Becky ran out of the trailer and snatched her mother's car keys, we also got the closest shot of the shooting target at door, with Shelly even turning around to give it a quick look. Both the commotion that followed and the scene in the crossroads concluded with Carl Rodd walking towards a woman lying on the ground - the grieving mother without a name in one and shaken Shelly, another mother, in the other.

Earlier in P6, before the accident, Carl was sitting on a park bench enjoying his coffee. He started paying strange attention to the green trees humming high above his head. That part of the foliage is called as the *canopy*. Carl's behavior suggested that another kind of green canopy in the fateful crossroads over a shop's display window was something interesting to think about.

[Same place, different reality.](https://preview.redd.it/a46vjewx20ke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19644b30c657a0772fe7c3efe4fc027410ad5101)

Back in the trailer park, when Carl was walking to Shelly, there was yet another kind of canopy in the background, a rain cover above a trailer's door. Curiously, even if there had been a roof on the canopy when Shelly arrived, now only a wooden frame remained. The broken continuity may have asked us to notice how the roofless structure was placed in the similar location and seen from the similar angle as the canopy in the crossroads.

Besides further associating the situations with one another, the missing roof had a likely further dimension. Later in P11, Cole had hearing problems.

>Albert: ""Maybe some warm milk. For the cat. On the *roof*?""

>Cole: ""Yes. The picture you took of *Ruth*.""

To keep things complicated enough, yet more scenes would get added to the furiously sprawling plot. Earlier in the episode, Albert spotted Ruth Davenport's missing, headless body on an abandoned Buckhorn backyard. *The missing roof* in Carl's trailer park would then suggest there was some kind of connection between Shelly and *the missing Ruth*, both lying on the grass close to a long, low box that was light blue - Ruth next to a container and Shelly next to a trailer house.

Before trying to make more sense of what that could have been all about, let's first try to figure out what really happened to Albert - and *why*. As it seems, like the boy on the pedestrian crossing, **Albert got killed in the Black Lodge waiting room** shortly after meeting with Diane. Following an abrupt jump from the bar to a new illusion in the crossroads, with Albert now as the happy little boy, the killer would have disrupted their reunion as the incoming Richard and / or his truck.

If this course of the story was figured out as intended, the culprit could be expected to have been present in the scenes that had a connection to the killing suggested to have been right before and after it. These were the one in the bar and the other in Carl's trailer park.

Yet another scene needs to join the plot to make sense of it. Elsewhere in P3, some Gene planted a bomb under Dougie's white Ford, causing the car to explode in P5. While upside down, *the bomb had the same shape of the shadow-like male torso* as the black hat in the bar and the man in the shooting target. 

[The black hat's temper was so bad anything could make it go off.](https://preview.redd.it/xfj4347j30ke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdc3fb3d7afb4b07d4423e2ea0e74d71675080e6)

The explosion itself seems to have been [a very high-concept retelling of the decapitation](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1inp4ui/all_the_evolution_of_the_arm/) of the man whose headless corpse was found in Ruth Davenport's bed in the opening episode. The car's wreckage would have been his now headless body while [the register plate flying to the neighboring roof the missing head](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1gbo8uk/all_dna/). 

The *bomb* and the explosion implying a connection between the mysterious shadow and raging violence, the same entity could be suspected to have also caused Albert's death. In the bar, the shadow would have appeared as *the black hat*, linked to the Civil War, first watching on as Albert went to Diane but then attacking him, this shown to us as Richard hitting the little boy in the crossroads. Afterwards, the murderous entity would have been back as the harmless shadow, now appearing in *the shooting target* by the trailer's door.

But why would this mystery shadow have wanted to kill Albert?

When Richard approached the crossroads, we briefly got his point of view. He clearly saw the STOP sign but only cursed and sped up, willing to ""blow"" the STOP sign - that is, to drive through without stopping. This created a connection to the bomb blowing up the Ford an episode earlier.

Coincidentally, the man who would earlier have been decapitated by this entity - or rather, just the bigger part of the man, the already headless corpse - seems to have also been in the bar with Albert, now [appearing as his umbrella](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1inp4ui/all_the_evolution_of_the_arm/) and later as the STOP sign in the crossroads. This could mean that **Albert was actually collateral while the intended target was his umbrella**, just like Richard never meant to kill the boy who only died because he happened to be on the way. 

[The blood-thirsty bonnet.](https://preview.redd.it/hokfb4k840ke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe0fe42030abdef0f4ec2f3053a886fa54e95ea0)

In the crossroads, we can probably identify the malicious shadow as Richard's 1973 F-Series Ford truck. After the accident, Richard drove the truck to a quiet place and stared at its bloodied front. He cleaned it up, stared at it again and climbed back to the truck. This was the last we saw of the vehicle, and it was never even mentioned again. 

Lynch putting his actors staring at something often indicates we needed to pay extra attention to what they were staring at. Another name for the car's hood is a *bonnet* which is also a kind of hat. The outline of the front of the truck's hood, as framed in the scene, made it look like an elongated black hat or a horizontally stretched male torso, likely suggesting **the truck was another abstraction of the murderous shadow suspected of the killing**.

A further implication was that this malicious entity had now latched itself on Richard. But *why him?*

Richard wasn't seen again before P10. While his earlier scene in P6 cut just as he climbed back to the *truck*, not to be shown again, now he got out of a 1996 *Saturn*, not seen earlier. Somehow, one ride turned into another - just how *literally* did that actually happen?

[At least he got a ride from his father.](https://preview.redd.it/0r1krnfk40ke1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12aff94536821d1fe368d7f80e7f1494ba52b872)

While the truck could be traced to the black hat in the bar, Richard's new ride would also go back to a black hat. Resembling the planet Saturn and thus known as *saturno*, [cappello romano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappello_romano) is a black hat with a wide brim. It is worn by Catholic priests who are addressed with the title Father. Together with [other Saturn related riddles](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1id6vxd/all_saturn/), this suggested that **Richard was this terrifying shadow's son**.

In the Black Lodge waiting room, there was a stylised Saturn figurine on the side table, closing the long loop back to the idea that the bar with the black hat was the same place. The figurine's purpose was not explained earlier, but as it seems, *Lynch had decided to turn the little statue into the main villain*.

We had a really happy 2 months or so together dating. I’m female and we’re both in our mid 20s. 

Then he got a new job and lost a lot of availability to go out, which I reassured him was totally fine. We still see each other a few times a week at a class we’re in. A month went by without any actual dates but we still texted every day, us both initiating too.

Well around this time I asked him if he’d like to be exclusive because we’d started making out, which was a big step for both of us as we’ve never dated anyone else before and have no experience.

I was sure he’d say yes, and was surprised when he told me no, that he’s not ready to be in a relationship yet. I reassured him I wasn’t asking to make it official, just exclusive, meaning we would only be romantic/flirty with each other and nobody else.

Then he said he can’t promise me that, because he’s concerned he might meet someone else in the future and doesn’t feel ready to commit to me.

I told him okay, let’s just go back to taking it slow. But then the following week he said we should just be friends for now because he feels bad he doesn’t have time to see me enough due to his job.

He promised me the break up wasn’t because of anything I said, that it’s all him not having enough time right now, and we can try again when his schedule clears up.

I’m just not sure how to feel and I’m confused because he was so excited to ask me out, saying he’d been thinking about it for over a year. But then everything changed when he got this new job and it’s like he’s not excited to be around me anymore, even saying he might be interested in seeing what else is out there.

He told me he’s not seeing or talking to anyone else, so I just don’t understand why he dumped me. Just said he doesn’t have time, not even to meet for coffee or ice cream once every two weeks.

I’m worried about him that maybe he’s dealing with something else. I don’t know, I just miss him, and I’m still seeing him at our class so it’s not like I can just forget and get over him that easily. 

He texted me the other night saying he can’t help thinking about me. I told him I’d love to try again, but he said he still thinks we should just be friends for now. I feel like we’re going in circles and I have no idea what to say to him, it’s like I’m just waiting to be asked out again. I’m not interested in seeing anyone else.

1istqdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1istqdg/they_were_innocent_creatures_part_one/,They were innocent creatures. [Part One],"William Harlowe, a former nurse at Good Samaritan Hospital, was 61-years-old when the police charged him with four counts of murder. The surveillance footage showed him entering the nursery at 2:47 AM, where he lifted a three-day-old Estrella Rodriguez out of her bassinet. He turned away from the camera and held her for one minute and forty seconds, during which time he removed a syringe from his sleeve and stuck the needle into the baby’s tiny jugular vein. When he placed Estrella back in her bassinet, she was already dead.

This was the fourth and final murder he committed. The first two went undetected, explained away as unfortunate cases of SIDS. But when the third newborn died without explanation, a detective with the San Jose Police Department finally put the pieces together. William Harlowe was the main suspect, along with an unknown accomplice who appeared to be part of the nursing staff. The second man stood in the background of each murder, keeping watch for bypassers and potential witnesses. But nobody recognized the individual. He wore sunglasses over his medical mask to conceal his identity. 

Unfortunately, it wasn’t until the after fourth murder when the cops finally put Harlowe down. He’d made a mistake: You could clearly see the syringe in his hand just before he plunged the needle into Estrella’s delicate neck. The surveillance footage burned him.

But Harlowe’s accomplice was never identified.

...

Last May, I drove out to the east side of San Jose and interviewed Daniel DiMarco, the homicide detective who resolved the case and arrested Harlowe. He was semi-retired by then, working night shifts for half the week and spending the other half shoulder-deep in booze. I knocked on the door, and the detective answered. He looked haggard and exhausted with that raggedy beard and those baggy eyes. The man reached out for a handshake, and I could smell the sweat emanating from the pit stains of his gray sweater. He spoke with the gravelly tone of a lifelong smoker.

“Rowan Thompson?” he said. “It’s good to meet you in person.”

Jesus, I thought. Sure, a murder detective might have some sleepless nights, but he looked like a homeless junkie. I stowed my hangups and wore my best PR grin.

“Likewise, Detective.”

“Call me Daniel,” he said. “Come on in. I just made some coffee.”

The house had been built decades ago for a large family. Photographs lined the wall showing a pair of kids and a round-faced Latina along with a man who vaguely resembled the detective. The carpet hadn’t been vacuumed in ages, matted up with old grime and dog hair like something dragged out of a condemned building. I didn’t see a dog around, nor a wife or kids for that matter. I figured it best not to bring it up. Not that I’m one to judge a solitary person. I never had a family of my own: Single, childless, and laser-focused on my work like the protagonist in the first act of a romcom. But Daniel’s situation didn’t seem quite so voluntary.

We entered the kitchen and sat across from each other at a dirty, chest-high island. A thin manila folder waited on the tiled counter between us.

“I’d like to record this interview,” I said. “Is that all right?”

“Sure. Go ahead.”

I set the recorder on the table and pressed the red button. “It’s 9:39 AM at the residence of Daniel DiMarco,” I said into the microphone, “a detective with the San Jose Police Department. Daniel, would you mind introducing yourself?”

He grunted something incomprehensible, then he stood up and lurched over to his coffee maker. The detective grabbed a dirty mug from the sink and rinsed it out, then he filled it with some joe and at least three fingers of Jameson. 

“Want some?” 

I shook my head, patiently waiting for him to sit back down so the recorder could pick up his answers clearly.

“I know it’s early,” he said, “but ten AM is bedtime for me.” He dropped himself into his chair with a heavy sigh. I could smell something rancid on his breath. “So did you have questions for me, or what?”

“Well, I wanna know everything there is to know about the case.”

He laughed humorlessly. “You sure you don’t want that drink?”

“Very.”

“Your call.” He pushed the manila folder towards me. “Go ahead and take a look.”

The folder contained a stack of printed stills taken from surveillance footage in the nursery at Good Samaritan. Black and white, fuzzy resolution. Two men stood near the bassinet — William Harlowe faced the camera, cradling a sleeping infant in his arms. The second man was visible only in profile. He was dressed in scrubs and had short, combed hair with a thin moustache poking out the sides of his medical mask.

Daniel reached across the island and tapped the image of Harlowe’s wrist. He wore a long-sleeve shirt under his scrubs, and there was a bulge visible under his sleeve.

“Do you know what that is?” said the detective.

“Yes. An empty syringe.”

“That’s right. He taped it to his wrist with a cover over the needle so he wouldn’t poke himself by mistake. Then when nobody was around, he’d pretend to go check on them. And, well—he pulled this off four fucking times before I got him.”

“Is this the image that made the case?”

“No,” he said. “The next one.”

I flipped to the next page. Harlowe’s back faced the camera now, but he stood at an angle where you could still see his hand and the baby’s neck. The needle protruded from his sleeve. There were only a dozen pixels to make the thing out.

“Good God,” I said. “How could something like this happen?”

The detective let out a heavy sigh and slurped down the rest of his coffee. Then he lumbered over to the coffee maker and refreshed his glass. I flushed up a bit when it occurred to me what a nonsense-burger of a question I’d just asked him. I moved on to something specific and concrete.

“Do you have any theories about the accomplice?” I said. “Who he is? How he gained access to the nursery?”

“Sure,” he said. “I’ve got theories. Everybody’s got a theory. You got a theory?”

“Well, as the lead detective who broke the case, your opinion carries quite a bit more weight than mine.”

“You know what they say about opinions, lady.” He burped and dropped himself back into his chair. Then he swayed for a moment, his eyes closed while he bobbed on an ocean of thought. I was just about to move on before he continued. “As far as I’m concerned, the man’s a ghost.” He opened his eyes and gave me a hard glare. “Either Harlowe buried him in a shallow grave somewhere, or he wised up and got the hell outta Dodge. Flip a coin. Either way, he’s in the wind—as they say.”

The mug trembled in his hand. I took a small photo clipping out of my pocket and set it down on top of the stack of papers. It was another photograph—this one cut out of a newspaper, the corner of a larger front-page snapshot. The picture showed a man sitting in the back of the courtroom. He wore the same mask with a thin moustache poking out the sides, but no sunglasses. His eyes were dark and vacant.

“This photo was taken the day they sentenced William Harlowe,” I said. “Doesn’t he look awfully familiar?”

The detective brushed the photo aside and said, “I’ve seen that. It’s a bunch of horseshit.”

“What makes you say that?”

“It’s a man with a goddamn moustache,” he shouted. “What, you wanna go and put out an APB on every fuckin’ guy in Silicon Valley with outdated facial hair?”

I chose my tone carefully before I continued. “I see your point. Sorry, you’re right. It was a stupid thing to bring up.”

He waved me off with a smile, and his volume returned to normal. “It’s all right. You’re just doing your job. Hell, I pissed off a lotta people trying to find that asshole. I hauled in half the fuckin’ hospital, brought the hammer down on them. Said I had this evidence and that witness statement. Almost got my ass sued.” He gulped down another mouthful of Irish coffee and shook his head. “No. It had to be a disguised intruder.”

The gears were running in his head again, like something wretched had been dredged from the pit of his being. He was solving the case all over again. I felt bad for putting him into this headspace right before his bedtime.

“There’s just one thing I couldn’t get past,” the detective continued. “When I interviewed Harlowe, he kept talking about some guy named Benjamin Morse. Apparently this character runs some kind of fucked-up self-help group. They lure in young men and say the key to happiness is to be alone. No girlfriends, no marriage, no children.” He paused, then he emphasized: “No children.”

“You think this Morse guy might’ve been the accomplice?”

“No. He didn’t fit the profile. Short, round guy with a big, white beard. There was something off about him, but we couldn’t pin him for conspiracy or anything like that.”

The detective slurped down the rest of the coffee in his mug, and he went back to the coffee maker for thirds. He returned to the island, yawning like a lion, and said, “I’m afraid I won’t be much use after I finish this last round.”

“That’s fine,” I said. “I just have one more question. Does Benjamin Morse accept women into this little group?”

He cocked an eye at me, and for a long moment he said nothing. Then he leaned closer and lowered his voice. “Would you mind shutting this off?”

That was never a good sign, but I had no choice but to comply. California law said so. I clicked off the red button sand said, “Is something wrong?”

“I wanna make one thing clear,” said the detective. “I know who you are, and I know why you’re doing this.”

I said nothing.

“I saw your work in Ukraine,” he growled. “You interviewed a young couple five minutes after their daughter died in a rocket attack. It was some real despicable stuff.”

“If you’re tired, I can get out of your hair.”

“I tried to help those kids,” he told me. “If you aim to get rich off them, that’s your soul on the line. Not mine. Don’t expect me to come looking for you if they disappear your ass.”

1istpqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1istpqf/2182024_dear_diary/,"2/18/2024 Dear Diary,","I feel like I’m running on a hamster wheel. Wake up uncomfortable, pump and get ready at the same time: hair, makeup, coffee, lunch. Put milk away, wash bottles, warm up the car and leave. 

Get to work, avoid the talkers. Plug in, answer critical teams messages, respond to boss’s emails. Try to stay on track and get pulled away. 

Check in on husband and baby, get a picture and feel sad I can’t be there. My most important job, and I can’t be there. 

11:00. Time to pump. Work and pump. Pump and take calls, pump and email. 

Back to my desk. More BS. More photos, more guilt. 

I could stay home, but with the current political climate, I need this job. 

4:00. Time to pump. Work and pump. Pump and work. Sometimes I pump driving home.  Most time, I pump driving home. 

Get home, change, ask about the day although I already know the answer. I’m happy to see my daughter. I feel like I’m failing my husband. He makes dinner. We eat dinner and he looks at his phone and reads the news. We don’t talk to one another simply because there’s not much to say. 

He cleans up while I take the baby. He asked me yesterday to help, then said he felt guilty for asking. Today he washed the floors and the stainless steel in the kitchen. I am so so thankful. We’re getting into a bedtime routine. 

While I put the baby down, he watches his shows. He deserves it. He had her all day, he needs to relax. Especially because he’s up with her all night when she wakes. He does his best to not wake me. I’m so blessed. 

I just feel disconnected. 

Put baby to bed, come downstairs, clean up work dishes from lunch, prep coffee. He’s watching his show with his AirPods on, I’m in silence. 

I like the silence. My mind is loud all the time. I’m tired. The guilt makes me tired. Work makes me tired. I haven’t had one proper nights sleep since I found out I was pregnant. I’m tired. But, so is he. 

I don’t want to be affectionate. I don’t feel anything. They say it’s the hormones. I hope it’s the hormones. I don’t love the way my body looks. I miss not being embarrassed to be naked in front of my husband. I’ve become so lazy. I signed up for a half marathon, and I’m not a runner. It will motivate me. When will I find the time though? I can’t even find time to peloton 

I need to peloton. I need to lose the baby weight. I need to fall in love with myself again so he will fall back in love with me. I know he loves me but it’s not the same. We feel like imbalanced partners. He’s doing most of the work and I’m out doing things, like working. 

I’m sad about my ring. We went to look at rings. The jeweler said they would need to make the ring. It’s been 3 months and I still haven’t heard back. I will follow up again tomorrow. I wish he would push the jeweler for it, but I’m being selfish. I don’t even need the ring to begin with. But I want to feel close to her when I’m not around. 

My therapist asked what I do for myself. I don’t do anything for myself. I grocery shop, which I love but I rush it because I feel bad he’s home with the baby. 

I feel like I’m letting the baby down. I don’t have age appropriate toys in my opinion, I need to find some. I need to make sure she’s at the right cognitive learning level. 

I’m crazy, she’s 6 months. But she must get bored quickly, right? 

I wish my friends would answer my texts. “Friends”. 

Everyone has their own lives. I’m thankful for the friends I do have. I need to get a birthday present for Samantha. I don’t know what to get her. I’m panicking about being at her party and leaving baby at my father in laws. 

I never enjoy myself when I’m out. Ever. I’m always worried about baby and whomever is watching her. What if they’re not playing with her, or ignoring her cries? I only trust my husband with her. 

This is what being a mom is, I think. No breaks, no time for myself. I just took 20 minutes to type this. This was my time.

I want sweets. I won’t have any. I need to lose the baby weight. And I need to pump. 

Thanks for listening, dear diary.

1isthmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1isthmz/i_wish_i_could_have_done_better/,I wish I could have done better,"We broke up a few years ago. She was my crush for eight years, practically my entire childhood. The first time I saw her, I was completely flabbergasted.

We ended things because her parents didn’t want her to date anyone at the time. She wanted to stay, she insisted, but I knew that no matter what, her parents would always stand by her, not me. I didn’t want to be the reason she drifted away from them. So instead of staying with her when her own family was saying, “You’re dead to us,” I ran. I apologized and left, just like a coward. It wasn’t what I wanted, but I thought it was the right thing to do.

To this day, I wish I had done something differently. I always think of that one line by a comedian: “In every future I imagined, you were with me. But since you’re not here, I can’t imagine a future anymore.”

I tried reaching out once, asking her to grab a coffee. She told me she had moved on. I’ve been in other relationships since, but in all of them, I was just searching for her essence.

I still remember how, back in 4th grade, I saved up chocolates for months just to make her a gift hamper for her birthday and did the same every year. Today, on her birthday, I reached out and wished her. She simply said, “Thank you.” I wanted to ask for another chance, but I couldn’t. We exchanged a few words, liked each other’s texts, and that was it.

I just hope I could have done better.",2,1739928980.0,OffMyChestIndia,7,1.0,False

I think she knows, and I suspect she might have a crush on me as well, but I’m not sure.

We’re on the same team but don’t work closely together. We sit on opposite sides of the room, so most of our interaction happens during team meetings and the weekly lunch (usually once or twice a week).

Lately, I’ve noticed she seems to glance at me more often when I walk around the office. Whenever I look back, she looks away (sometimes smiling, sometimes not). This happens several times a day. When we have team lunch together, she sometimes sits next to me (or I sit next to her), and her body language is more relaxed—she leans towards me or has her feet/shoulders poinsting at me. If she doesn't sit next to me, she sits on the other side of the table, facing me, and maintains eye contact before quickly looking away. She also cracks jokes or tries to engage me more than others during our lunch.

The company serves lunch once a week. One thing that stands out is that she’s often behind me in the lunch line, almost every time. Is that a coincidence?

She always greets me with a smile, which, honestly, makes me melt.

Today, I asked her if she wanted to grab coffee, and she accepted. The conversation was short but engaging, and she asked me a lot of questions, some even personal. I was off yesterday and she asked WHY was off. I was caught off guard by that one, lol.

Winnipeg Free Press 18-02-25

Winnipeg Free Press readers were introduced to columnist Shawna Forester Smith in February 2024. The chronically ill, disabled Ojibwa writer and health-care advocate lived in a chronic care unit at Deer Lodge Centre.

It was her hope, through the column, that readers would gain an understanding of what life is like in chronic care.

Readers were quick to learn Shawna was a fighter, that she chose to live valiantly. She was also a fighter for others, calling out shortcomings and systematic failures in the health-care system.

On Feb. 14, Shawna was admitted to the ICU where she died due to complications related to pneumonia. She fought to the bitter end.

Shawna loved writing the column. She loved the relationships it created. Readers would send her gift cards, notably for McDonald’s coffee — her favourite — birthday cards, crafting supplies and drop in for a visit.

Despite her tenacity, Shawna was also realistic about her long-term prognosis and, in her pragmatic way, knew what she wanted to say in her final column.

So she wrote it, three months ago, in anticipation of an eventuality that arrived far too soon.

\------------------

This last column I won’t ever read because if you’re reading this, it means I have left this Earth for whatever is next.

Someone I knew left a Compass for Living when she died and I thought it was brilliant, so I am stealing her idea. Thanks, JoAnn — may your memory be a blessing.

So here it is.

Shawna’s Compass for Living

1. Collect people, not things. Things offer fleeting happiness. Relationships are what give our lives meaning and purpose, not stuff.

2. Choose love. Love the shit out of your family and friends. Tell people that you love them. Show love towards strangers because we are all connected.

3. Choose kindness. It’s actually less effort to be kind than it is to be an asshole. Perform acts of kindness every day. They don’t have to be big or expensive. It can be as simple as giving a hug or listening to someone.

4. You’re never too old for a stuffy. This I was told by a wise beyond her years nine-year-old who died far too young.

5. Don’t be afraid to do things because of the word ‘no.’ Because what if they say yes?

6. There’s no such thing as too much education or wasted learning.

7. You can have more than one soulmate.

8. Family is also the people we choose.

9. Every stranger has the potential to be a friend.

10. Help people if you can — it’s the right thing to do. Help as many people as you can. Help your family and friends and help strangers, too. You will rarely regret helping someone.

11. The best gift you can give someone is your time.

12. Visit the sick, elderly and isolated people who you know. Visit them often. It means more than you will ever know.

13. Write people letters and send people cards. It’s a delight to get fun mail.

14. Be grateful. Be gracious. Remember to say miigwetch.

15. Leave the judgment to the Creator. Try not to judge others — we don’t walk their path.

16. We get out of life what we put into it. If you want love, love others. If you want to be treated with respect, respect others. It’s pretty simple really.

17. We’re all creative. Find your outlet. Creating is medicine.

18. It’s not so much what happens to us that matters in life, it’s how we react to what happens to us that really matters. That is what we have control over.

19. It’s never too late to forgive or ask for forgiveness. Don’t leave the Earth with unfinished business. Make right the wrongs.

20. Find your person. The person who gets you better than anyone else. The person you feel safe with and trust. The person who you can bare your soul to. The person who loves you warts and all. The person who will always be there for you. We all need a person like that.

 I have so much love and gratitude for all the caregivers who looked after me on my journey. Without them, I would have been dead years ago.

I had a really good life despite it being really hard. I loved so many people and I was loved by so many people. I fell in love and remained in love with my husband, Brent, for over 20 years. I also found my “person.”

I had the love of not one, but four families because of adoption, finding my birth families and marriage. I had a huge chosen family. There are so many people who called me their daughter, their sister and their auntie who I didn’t share blood with.

There are a lot of people who called me their bestie. I had more than one person I considered a kindred spirit.

I made connections with so many caregivers over the years. People who shared laughter and tears with me. People who worried about me. Some of them told me their secrets and asked me for advice.

I have so much love and gratitude for all the caregivers who looked after me on my journey. Without them, I would have been dead years ago. They gave me the gift of time. And what a wonderful gift that was.

Writing about my life was a surprise but those were the columns you readers seemed to enjoy the most. And, I really enjoyed writing them.

I’d like to thank all of you for being there, too. So many people have reached out to me to tell me how much my writing meant to them and what an impact it made. People also honoured me by sharing their stories and struggles. It truly was an honour.

I was inundated with cards, letters, emails, phone calls, messages on social media, gifts, homemade gifts, flowers and even people surprising me by coming in person to see me. I made friends because of the column. People asked if they could visit me.

Never in a million years when I started this column in February 2024, did I expect any of this. I didn’t plan on writing that much about me. My plan was to write about health-care issues. The paper initially didn’t commit to anything either.

Writing about my life was a surprise but those were the columns you readers seemed to enjoy the most. And, I really enjoyed writing them. Chi miigwetch for all the love and support you gave me. It was a great gift.

I also want to thank the Free Press. Editor Paul Samyn took a chance on me. I made sure to thank him for that.

My fearless editor, Scott Gibbons, was a pleasure to work with. He had the gift of being able to edit my writing without distorting my voice. That is not something that every editor can do. He always understood the importance of what I was doing.

I was allowed to write about whatever I wanted. That’s pretty much every columnist’s dream job. They helped make a lifelong dream come true for me. It never felt like work. I enjoyed writing every word. I also enjoyed writing back to everyone who wrote to me.

Life is hard, but life is also amazing. I’d do it all over again in a heartbeat.

I’ll end this by reminding you the most important thing in life is the people we choose to share it with. You can never have too many people. Strangers are just people we aren’t friends with yet. Don’t get so preoccupied with living life that your relationships suffer.

Make time for the people in your life. Don’t put off spending time with your family and friends. The laundry will still be there.

Make sure your people know how much you love them. If you put love into the universe, you will be showered with love in return. And isn’t that wonderful.

Life is hard, but life is also amazing. I’d do it all over again in a heartbeat. I’d appreciate fewer health conditions if I had a second kick at the can, but I had a wonderful life despite all the hard stuff. The good stuff made it worth it.

If there’s a newspaper in the afterlife, hopefully they will let me write for it. I won’t let fear of ‘no’ stop me from asking this time. Because what if they say yes?

When I go to sleep and have a very deep sleep, I can wake up and not feel completely refreshed. My body feels refreshed a bit but my mind and brain is not feeling it. I can learn new things and it feels like I am not growing as a person or learning anything at all. I would learn the thing eventually but I would not feel refreshed or the achievement of learning something hard in my brain. I can even have an orgasm but it's like my mind and brain doesn't feel the satisfaction effect. 







I can ejaculate normally but it's not effected. I can also eat healthy foods all day long and my body can feel strong and healthy but my mind isn't feeling the satisfying effects and growth from it. I can watch a good movie and see it's good but not get the satisfying effects and the good enjoyment that I can just continue to. I can take any supplements that I want and not feel the full effects in my mind and brain but my body will be impacted. For example, I can take melatonin and my body will feel weak and tired and I would get exhaustion but my mind and brain won't feel it or it's like it would be fighting against the effects when I am literally not doing anything. 








This happens with coffee as well and I don't have a high tolerance towards these things at all. What is possibly causing this? I went to the doctor and she said that I should go to a neurologist but my insurance is causing too many issues with it and it's getting out of hand now. I have been like this for months and it's like my brain isn't working properly. Is this an issue with some neurotransmitters in my brain or something? Any thoughts?

I have been diligently researching these gorgeous machines for weeks now. Can't sleep without thinking about them. I am now in the process of saving up the considerable sum of money required to own one, while also trying to convince my wife that we need to move on from our French press. Now I need your help.

1. Construction. A few reviews have mentioned that the machine is made of plastic, more than one might expect. Is this true?

2. Coffee temperature. With the glass karafe, I have seen a few mention that the second cup of coffee is not even warm after 20 minutes or so. Tough, if true. Any truth to this?

3. Is it as gorgeous as I think it is? Or is it all an illusion?

4. Does anyone have any recommendations as to how to convince your better half to let you have this magnificent piece of equipment?

Any help is appreciated.

Yours in coffee,

I just got my hours temporarily cut at my store. at first I was concerned about how broke I'd be after but regardless working 3 days instead of 5 was incredible. It's like you regain a bit of your sense of self, you're no longer in autopilot/zombie mode all week, you can actually use your days off to do what you wanna do, instead of just recovering/trying to forget about work. I'm gonna die one day and there's so much I want to do, but I have to spend the majority of my time sitting here in someone else's store tendering goofies in pajamas all day long. I wanna make music, listen to music, not just passively, but sit down and focus on the music for hours, I wanna lift weights, I wanna read, and again not just read in between customers with store music blasting, but sit down and comfortably enjoy my book. I wanna watch movies without passing out halfway through and going to brush my teeth at 3am when I wake up and realize what happened. I wanna sit in a cafe instead of hoping they hurry up with my coffee so I can just get to work and just get the day over with. I wanna go to bed without double checking that my alarm is set and calculating how late i can stay up while still getting enough sleep. not to mention events and things going on which id actually able to attend at my leisure instead of after work or on the weekend. for me the worst part isn't even working, it's the feeling of having to work tomorrow, and all week. that's why I'm actually happy to work, but just 3 days a week. it doesn't seem like much but the change from 3 to 5 is everything. 3 days a week honestly feels like nothing in comparison, my mood is better at work, I'm actually happy to be there.

these days, my life is pretty much a binary. 0 or 1. I'm either at work or I'm not. even the shittiest moments in my personal life might as well be heaven compared to work. even if I'm getting pelted with dog shit I can at least leave and do something else without the risk of being broke and starving. simply having most of my time eaten up just to barely survive is the worst thing in my life. otherwise, my life is actually pretty good, I just have little time to enjoy it. 

truthfully I work so hard outside of work on my creative hobbies, some have to take a bit of a backseat, I don't read as much as I'd like to and that really bums me out. regardless, even if someone wants to sit around and play video games and wank, should they not have the free time to do that? maybe with the additional free time they'd be able to cultivate better uses of their time? we all know the feeling of wanting to go full hedonist mode on your precious weekend

how have we made it to the point where we have disposable vapes that can record videos but everyone still needs to work 5+ days a week in order for society to function. do you think a progressive utopian future is compatible with this amount of compelled labour? do you believe work should be a background thing for most people, and not the primary thing their life revolves around?

idk I sound like such a whiner I'm sorry but I rly don't fit into society this way. I know most people hate their job and hate working in general but I really think I hate it more lmao like I just can't do this shit",11,1739927523.0,rs_x,4,1.0,False

I was just drawing and minding my own business, until I suddenly felt a change in my chest that was heavy and my neck artery felt like it was hurting as well as my right arm feeling numb without me having been laying on it. I started to worry that it could be a heart attack, and looked up symptoms that I may have missed previously, but it continued to send me into a panic and I had to stop myself.

I tried rationalizing it: maybe it was from the amount of coffee I had today and I was finally crashing from the caffeine, maybe I was just stressed from the day or stressed about work tomorrow since I have to be in early, etc. But the rationalizing started feeling a bit hopeless, so I decided to shock myself out of my anxiety by going outside into the cool, crisp air. I of course wore a jacket and shoes, but the chill of the air was really cold and I shook violently as I stayed out there for a minute and went back in to do breathing exercises. 4 seconds in, hold for 4, breathe out for another 4 and so on until my body calmed down enough and I was done shaking. I felt the carpet in my hands as I sat on the floor, I listened to the refrigerator running, the clock ticking on the wall, and I looked around the room in silence.

I then decided to call my boyfriend since he usually helps ground me again, and talking with him made me feel a bit better. However, within the conversation, I had said that I feel too fearful to live, but also too scared of death, so I feel like I'm stuck in a limbo. I know that I will die someday, and that's the main thing that scares me out of everything.. something happening to me and my consciousness would cease to exist. It terrifies me since I don't know how it feels or what would happen when I do eventually leave this existence. I even thought of the fact that maybe it should just happen so I could get it over with, but I don't actually want that either. It was such a confusing statement that even my boyfriend told me I was being irrational thinking that.

I know I can't cope with this anxiety on my own, but I really try my best.. perhaps I really should try and go back to therapy, but that would take a bit to set up due to my medical insurance being practically nonexistent.. this is the first major attack I've had since May of last year, and I really tried my best to get out of it in the only ways I knew how. I think I'm okay now, still a bit shaken and my chest hurts, but that comes with anxiety.. I just really needed to write this all down to visualize it and feel better.

she tends to struggle with abandonment issues and i never fault her for it—however, instead of seeking affirmation when she feels insecure she tries to push me away. i love her very dearly and i really want to continue being her friend but i'm so exhausted. 

i have an open 8th period and she has an english class at that time—today she drove me to school because we wanted to get coffee in the morning and i was initially planning to wait until the end of the day so she could drive me home (she had offered) but my girlfriend (who also has an open 8th) offered to give me a ride home sooner which i took so i could be home sooner. i texted her the moment i knew (1.5 hours before the end of the day) and thought it was fine. later that day i received a text where she's requested i tell her sooner next time, i explained how i told her asap but she took what i assume was a moment of insecurity and basically tried to push me away. 

i wont go into much detail but she basically said i was prioritizing my girlfriend over her because i had my girlfriend give me a ride home. we had a conversation around 3 months ago about how she feels insecure if i speak about my girlfriend too much when we hang out and since then she has verbally affirmed that i have changed these behaviors. however, today she went back on her previous statement and said i have never changed. i understand her and her past so i just asked how i can change specifically, when she offered the advice i sincerely apologized for my actions. 

the whole time we had been ""arguing"" she would reply in 3 minutes however, the moment i sincerely apologized she didnt reply (and as of now still has not)—this is a pattern i recognize a lot with her. i think shes never had someone who wants to work through problems genuinely with her and dosent know how to respond because she isn't used to it. i dont want to bombard her asking her to reply or anything like that but i do want to help her not feel insecure or try to push me away. 

im so exhausted having to continuously try to mold into a high expectation she has set as a byproduct of her trauma but i truly love being her friend—does anyone know how i can help her not push me away? additionally, does anyone know how i can make this less emotionally exhausting for myself?

($IMG) – 28 Months Cash In Hand +Major Catalysts Coming Up,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share a stock I’ve been watching lately – CIMG Inc. ($IMG). This one has been flying under the radar, but with some major catalysts coming up, it could be ready for a big breakout.

Here’s why I’m excited:

Earnings Report on Monday, 24th Before Market Open:
The big catalyst coming up is earnings, dropping before market open on Monday. And here’s the kicker – CIMG currently has 28 months of cash in hand, which is huge for a company like this. They’re in a strong position to grow, and this cash position alone is something the market will take notice of.

Expansion Into China – Big Money Opportunity
On top of that, the earnings will include results from their expansion into China, which could be a massive money maker. China is a huge market for their consumable products like coffee and convenience drinks. This is definitely going to be a key focus in the earnings report, and it could be the catalyst that sends the stock flying.

Q3 Was Weak, Q4 Could Beat Expectations:
Q3 was a rough quarter, but that sets the stage for an earnings beat in Q4. With the cash in hand and the expansion into China, this could be the positive surprise the stock needs. Investors could get excited about the growth potential moving forward.

MACD is About to Cross – Technicals Look Good:
Technically, the stock is setting up nicely. The MACD on the daily chart is about to cross, which is usually a bullish signal. Plus, it’s sitting near a key resistance level. If we break through that, we could see a nice run-up.

Volume is 3 Million – Shows Interest:
With an average volume of 3 million, this stock is definitely seeing interest. It’s a good sign that the stock is on people’s radar and could see some explosive moves when the news hits.

No Dilution Since September 2024:
One more thing to note – there’s been no dilution since September 2024. This is important because it means the company hasn’t been issuing additional shares, which could dilute the value of existing shares. This helps keep the value of your investment intact and adds confidence that the stock isn’t being overly diluted.

My Position:
I’ve got a small position in this one, not betting the farm, but the potential here is real. The combination of strong cash reserves, a major expansion into China, no dilution, and a potential earnings beat could trigger a huge rally.

Key Points to Watch:
	•	28 months of cash in hand
	•	Expansion into China
	•	Earnings report Monday 
	•	MACD about to cross
	•	3 million average volume
	•	No dilution since September 2024

This could be one of those “underdog” plays that surprises everyone. Do your own research, but this one’s on my radar for sure.

I’m really hoping someone can point me in the right direction. This will be a bit long winded so bear with me. About a month ago I started to experience some chest pain in the center of my chest that feels fairly dull. The best way I can describe is if I had had a bad cough and now my chest is sore from coughing, except I have not been sick at all. I wound up trying to go to a clinic that made me go to the ER and they took my vitals and did an EKG and everything looked normal. I was nervous to do further testing so I opted out at the hospital and went home. I’ve never experienced acid reflux before but I saw on google that it could be a possibility so I decided to try omeprazole over the counter. The side effects from the omeprazole were rough and I’m not sure it made anything better so I stopped taking it and went to an urgent care. The urgent care doctor prescribed me famotidine to take twice daily but this didn’t seem to help the chest pain and added new symptoms such as bloating, clay stools and a burning throat and eyes. After a week I stopped taking the medication and saw a GP. The GP said it could be H Pylori and had me come back in a few weeks to test because I was taking antacids. The test came back negative. I had a consult with a GI specialist and he was not convinced that the problem was GI related but just to rule it out I decided to schedule an endoscopy that I’m still waiting on. I am also looking into scheduling an appointment with a cardiologist but I’ve started a new job recently and it’s difficult when I have no eto to be able to see a doctor and I don’t want to make a bad impression. A few other things… it does seem to get worse when drinking wine, coffee and eating spicy foods(not much), although almost anytime I eat, it tends to not feel great but only makes the condition mildly worse. It gets worse if I talk too much or when I breath in deeply (running has been fun). At this point after stopping all the antacids, I only have dull chest pain (up to a 5 out of 10), bad breath and fatigue. I’m a woman in my late 20s, healthy weight, workout 3-4 times a week, no drugs but i will drink up to a half a bottle of wine on one weekend night but drink no other nights (condition started while doing dry January), no history of any illnesses related to lungs or heart or gut. My family has no illnesses related to any of these besides my brother who has Crohns disease. If anyone has any suggestions it would be greatly appreciated… I’m really suffering at this point and I feel lost on what to do and I’m in near constant pain :(",1,1739927038.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1issr1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatCareCrew/comments/1issr1i/cat_parents_what_are_some_gifts_youd_actually/,"Cat parents, what are some gifts you'd actually love? Here's my list...","As much as I love treating myself, I can’t help but admit I live for my cats. They light up my life like nothing else in the world. That’s why I have a knack for spoiling these two rotten!

When I got my first kitty, my mom and friend gifted me a ton of cat objects that I would never think of getting myself.

If you have a cat parent in your life, there are many fun gifts to give them. I figured I would share all the fun cat-inspired gifts I’ve gotten, and hopefully inspire more purr-fect cat gifts for every cat parent on your list.

Cat backpack anyone? 

When buying important cat products, try to think outside the box. For example, everyone needs a cat carrier. But what about fun and unique carriers, like a cat backpack or stroller? If your loved one travels a lot with their pet, you can also get them a heavy-duty bag or carrier to take on planes or a tunnel for road trips.

Interactive and robotic toys 

All cats love toys, but cat nip-filled stuffies are things of the past. Interactive and robotic toys are in, and cats love the constant stimulation they provide. My friend gave me a ball track toy, and my guys are obsessed with those things.

Cat subscription boxes! 

While food and treats are always handy, knowing which brands, types, and flavors to get is always challenging. Even though a gift card is always a safe bet, I like the idea of ordering a subscription for a cat parent. These subscriptions usually include food, treats, toys, and more. If you don’t want to commit to paying every month, most companies sell one box or a temporary subscription to get your loved one started.

Tech litter love for cat parents

In addition to food and treats, a high-quality litterbox is also essential. When I got my first cat, my friend gave me a litterbox from a cat subscription she hadn’t used. But deep down, I wish someone would get me a robot litterbox. Litter robots are the best on the market, but they’re pretty pricey ($700), so this is a better gift idea than a “treat my cats” option.

Scratch posts and toys

My guys love scratching up my furniture, so I will be the first to tell you that scratchy posts and toys are some of the best presents for cat owners. My mom got my cats a couple of different scratchers. You can find so many unique ones on the market—I have a few vampire and goth scratchers!

Cat climbers and towers (a beloved cat-parent gift)

On that note, don’t forget cat climbers and towers. I have a couple of cat towers, and both cats adore them. My mom gifted me a small cat tower that they still use (though they’re now both big enough for the taller cat tower). There are so many cute cat towers–my mom found some with coffins! I also see ones shaped like fruit and flowers. If you really want to be a good friend, assemble it for your loved one (what my stepdad did for me).

So many people are cat-obsessed, and there are many ways to express your love for cats.

Cat art 

For example, cat art is one of my favorite things right now. My friend gifted me a cat magnet for my birthday and quilted me plush cats that look like my kitties. You can also find cat portraits, wall art, and more on platforms like Etsy.

Cat clothing 

I’ve also been getting into cat clothing and accessories. Because my mom knows I can never have too many cat shirts! In addition to shirts, I always find sweaters, hats, and jewelry with cat artwork.

Cat home decor 

That said, I’m just as much of a fan of cat household accessories. I told my mom I needed a new coffee mug, and she got me one with a cat on it. I also have cat figurines, candles with cat artwork, and more.

Feel-good cat books

I’m an avid reader, and there’s nothing better than cozying up with a feel-good cat book. You can find cat-centered fiction in every genre. My nephew is also a cat lover, and I’ve gotten him cat children’s books. There are also many nonfiction books about cats, such as how to be a better cat parent and various cat encyclopedias.

Lots and lots of treats (for us and our cats)

Treats for cats are always important but don’t forget treats for humans. I got myself cat-themed coffee, but I’ve also found other fun treats like cat-shaped cookies and cat chocolate.

What does everyone think of these ideas? Are there any I missed? Let’s keep this going and share our favorite gifts for cat parents! ",1,1739926936.0,CatCareCrew,0,1.0,False
1issqha,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiKilledMyStartUp/comments/1issqha/ai_takes_the_wheel_meet_the_fintech_disruptors/,AI Takes the Wheel: Meet the Fintech Disruptors Revolutionizing Your Money,"AI just stole my coffee break because it's too busy revolutionizing finance, and I kind of want to say thank you—or maybe blame it. As AI continues its magnificent (and somewhat menacing) march into practically every industry, it's leaving quite a trail of startups, investments, and yes, dramatic disruptions in its wake. 

Let's talk about Finmo, the latest AI darling making waves in the corporate treasury landscape. Yep, PayPal Ventures and Citi Ventures have put their chips on this intriguing startup, throwing a cool $18.5 million at it to create a treasury operating system that's so next-gen, it probably sees your bank account and shyly swipes left. With features like real-time payment capabilities and liquidity optimization, it's aiming to makeover how organizations handle their money globally. All the while, former PayPal exec David Hanna is calling the shots, proving once more that if you want to master fintech, perhaps a stint at PayPal is the secret sauce.

But wait, we've got more players shaking up the field. Sardine, for example, just snacked on a $70 million Series C round (anchovies not included), led by big league capital muscle like Activant Capital and Google Ventures. They're all about thwarting financial fraud with AI, facing off against villains like deepfakes and industrial-scale social engineering attacks. Sardine’s AI agents, with their superhuman ability to blitz through KYC processes and sniff out fraud, are like the Avengers of financial security—except their only gear is smart algorithms and unflagging determination.

And hold onto your gavels, because Harvey is lawyering up with $300 million in fresh investments to roll out AI-assisted workflows at law firms. This little legal eagle is winning over the top U.S. law firms, proving that even the most tradition-bound industries are opening their doors to the AI evolution.

So, here's the million-dollar (or maybe $18.5 million) question: In this whirlwind where AI seems to have its virtual fingers in every pie—are we witnessing the golden age of corporate efficiency, or are we standing at the precipice of a new kind of dependency on algorithms? What's your verdict? Share your thoughts and where you see this AI revolution steering us next.",1,1739926894.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

The Impact of Thoughtful Kitchen Gifts on New Homeowners
--------------------------------------------------------

Moving into a new house is an exciting milestone in anyone's life. As a new homeowner, you’re stepping into a world of possibilities, especially in the kitchen. This space is often considered the heart of the home, where meals are made, memories are created, and invitations to friends and family are joyfully extended. For those looking to nurture relationships with new homeowners, a thoughtfully chosen kitchen gift can have a lasting impact.

One of the most influential aspects of gifting kitchen items is the personal touch they offer. A well-selected item shows that you care and understand the recipient's needs. Here are some reasons why thoughtful kitchen gifts resonate so well with new homeowners:

### Creating a Warm Atmosphere

A gift that enhances the kitchen experience fosters a welcoming environment. Items like stylish kitchen towels, decorative canisters, or a beautiful fruit bowl can make the space more inviting. Here’s how they contribute:

- **Set the Mood:** A lovely centerpiece can become a conversation starter when guests arrive.
- **Reflect Personal Style:** Gifts that align with their taste add character and warmth to the kitchen.
- **Encourage Comfort:** Cozy items, like handmade trivets or personalized cutting boards, make cooking feel more like a homey activity.

### Practicality Meets Thoughtfulness

Kitchen gifts that blend usability with sentimentality strike the perfect balance. New homeowners often need items that are not only beautiful but also functional. Consider the following:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-welcoming-gifts-kitchen  
  
- **Kitchen Gadgets:** Think about practical tools like a versatile peeler, garlic press, or a quality set of measuring cups.
- **Cookbooks:** A well-curated cookbook can inspire culinary creativity and provide cherished family recipes.
- **Food Storage Solutions:** Glass storage containers or reusable silicone bags can help keep their kitchen organized.

### Inspiring Culinary Adventures

Gift-giving can serve as a launchpad for new culinary experiences. When you provide kitchen gifts that encourage cooking, you empower new homeowners to explore and expand their food-making skills. Here’s how:

- **Unique Ingredients:** Specialty herbs, spices, or oils can motivate them to try new recipes.
- **Cooking Classes:** Consider gifting a voucher for a local cooking class. It’s a fun way for them to learn and meet new people.
- **Themed Gift Baskets:** Create a basket focusing on a particular cuisine—maybe Italian, Mexican, or Asian—complete with ingredients and utensils.

### Building Memories

Cooking often leads to unforgettable memories shared among family and friends. A thoughtful kitchen gift can reinforce the importance of gathering together. When new homeowners have the right tools, they can host dinner parties and family meals with ease. Some gifts to facilitate this include:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-welcoming-gifts-kitchen

- **Serving Platters and Bowls:** Perfect for entertaining, they'll appreciate having these handy when hosting.
- **Wine or Cocktail Accessories:** Items like wine glasses, cocktail shakers, or a bar set can enhance any gathering.

### Promoting Sustainability

As the world becomes more eco-conscious, gifts that promote sustainability are appealing. Kitchen items that are environmentally friendly can set the tone for a responsible lifestyle in their new home:

- **Reusable Produce Bags:** Encourage greener practices with practical items that reduce waste.
- **Bamboo Utensils:** These not only serve a purpose but are also biodegradable, making them an excellent alternative to plastic.
- **Compost Bins:** Introducing a compost bin can inspire a mindful approach to food waste.

Thoughtful kitchen gifts can significantly impact new homeowners. They not only enhance the aesthetics and functionality of the kitchen but also foster relationships and create cherished memories. By choosing gifts that resonate with the homeowner's style and needs, you play an essential role in their new journey. A simple kitchen gift can inspire them to embrace their new space, turning it into a lively hub for cooking and connection.

### Conclusion

Choosing the perfect home welcoming gifts for the kitchen can truly make a difference in how new homeowners feel about their new space. The kitchen often serves as the heart of the home—where meals are prepared, memories are made, and gatherings happen. By giving thoughtful gifts that blend practicality with a touch of warmth, you help create a nurturing environment for those settling into their new abode.

My name is David, and I’m a 29-year-old IT tech from New Jersey on a quest for a meaningful, long-term relationship with someone who shares my values and passions.

**A bit about me:**

I’m about 5’10”, bald but naturally blond, and I sport a stylish beard. My usual attire includes black band shirts and black jeans—think laid-back, metal-head vibes with a touch of nerdy charm. If that sounds like your kind of aesthetic, we might just click! (Pics here: [https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0](https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0))

**What I’m into:**

When I’m not diving into the worlds of extreme metal (Black Metal is my jam) or gaming, I enjoy spending time with friends doing things like:

• Camping trips under the stars

• Exploring museums

• Renaissance faire adventures

• Watching movies (especially showing my best friend ones he hasn’t seen)

• Playing board games or video games

Recently, I’ve started learning a new language (こんにちは!) and experimenting with building Gundam model kits.

**Professionally:**

I work in IT and hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. My job keeps me busy but also lets me hang out with a great group of coworkers.

**Personality-wise:**

I’m laid-back, lighthearted, and always quick with a joke to brighten the mood. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs (not even coffee!), but I’m completely cool with others enjoying their drinks around me. My friends would probably describe me as funny, reliable, and someone who thrives on meaningful connections.

**What I’m looking for:**

I’m hoping to meet someone younger (ideally between 18 and 24) who’s also looking to build a future together. I’d love to find someone whose experiences and goals align with mine, so we can grow and share meaningful moments side by side. While I don’t have a timeline in mind for things like eloping or kids, I value the idea of creating a life full of shared adventures and growth.

I’m especially drawn to someone with an average or slim body type. I’m not a fan of tattoos, but piercings aren’t a big deal, so don’t hesitate to reach out if we connect on other levels!

If you’re a fellow nerd, gamer, or someone who shares my love for metal, movies, and meaningful connections, I’d love to hear from you. Send me a message and a picture—I’m looking forward to getting to know you better!",0,1739926509.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False
1isskzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibroids/comments/1isskzm/one_month_post_surgery_laparoscopic_myomectomy/,One Month Post Surgery (Laparoscopic Myomectomy),"**Here to answer any questions about my experience if I can!**

I'm also wondering for those that had a similar procedure (my primary incision was 4cm/1.5in on my right side), **when did you get back to exercise and what kind of activities?** Tomorrow will be one month since my surgery and I still don't feel ready to do much beyond walking... but looking for some hope and realistic timelines.

  
To start, I took 3.5 weeks off work (today was my first day back at work) but was approved for up to 6 weeks off (paid short-term disability). Originally I thought I would only need 2.5 but had to extend to 3.5 weeks. I could honestly probably use more in some ways because I still get sharp stabbing pains and am not back to my normal routine (at least physically).

**First 24hrs post surgery:** definitely painful, while still in post-op at hospital had to keep asking for more pain medication, when I went to get wheeled out of the hospital I became nauseous and had to throw up. Car ride home was fine - I saw a lot of posts about buying a special pillow for the car, but this was not necessary for me. Granted my drive home was like 5 minutes. In general, though, a lot of items on the surgery shopping lists I came across felt very unnecessary (more on that down below). Got home slept on and off. Nausea was worst this first day coming off the anesthesia, but not awful. Watched TV and was able to eat some soupy buttered pasta for dinner. This first night, I had to get out of bed in the early morning to pee, and I wanted to cry because the pain was really bad trying to get out and then back in bed. Generally, nighttime and early mornings are most painful for me as my last medication is taken somewhere between 9-10pm and then it wears off by the time I wake up. 

**48-72 hours:** On the 2nd day I decided I needed to be strict with staying on a consistent schedule with the pain meds to stay ahead of the pain. Oxycodone was taken every 4 hours (you don't need food in belly for this one, so I would take one as soon as I woke up). 800mg Ibuprofen pill was taken every 6 hours with food. My friend that is an OBGYN recommended I add Gabapentin to help with nerve pain around incision site. Got my doctor to call this in easily and have been on it since. I take the IBU + GAB together, usually trying to put some space between the oxy. My doc had also recommended Lidocaine patches for the incision site (which I do think helped - but make sure you put some silicone tape or bandage on the incision first as I had some of the lidocaine sticky patch get into my wound!). I had no issue with appetite but wanted to eat nutritious food that would not put more gas in my belly.

**First week:** Consistent with the 3x pain meds listed above, plus Gas X and MiraLax (don't think I was able to poo until day 5, very not normal for me). By day 3 I was thinking by the end of week two I should be completely back to normal. Boy was I wrong - those were the pain meds speaking! haha. My husband had a little care package waiting for me when I got back from the hospital -- my favorite items were a coloring book and colored pencils and Ritz crackers (essential and delicious for the first few days!). Every morning I would have a routine of making coffee, adding my MiraLax to it, eating something for breakfast so I could take the Ibuprofen asap, and then sitting down to my coloring book. After that, I would move to the couch or bed and watch TV. I took it really easy this first week and did not leave my house at all.

**Second week:**  Started to feel better so by the following weekend (1.5 weeks in), I went for a little walk around the neighborhood with my dog and husband. Took it very slow. The next day did the same going a little further. I got more bold, taking longer walks with my dog (now feeling more comfortable to go out on my own) but would be in more pain later that evening if I did ""too much"" earlier. When I saw my doctor, she said this was normal. Was surprised when she said she would do a refill on the oxycodone (to me, necessary... and I know the opioid addiction risks), so I gladly accepted since pain was manageable at this point, but would still need an oxy a day (on average).

**Third week:** Similar to the second week, but pulled back on the oxy, really letting the IBU + GAB do the heavy lifting of pain management. Incision site fully closed now. I still get some sharp pains on my side (on and below where my incision is), especially when walking around, cleaning, bending down, etc. Basically you mentally feel back to normal but your body isn't quite there yet and it's frustrating. I'm so eager to get back to yoga, hiking and a workout routine but not sure if it's a bad idea to start any of these up too soon. I don't want to have to take steps backward....



**My Post-Surgery Essentials (short list):**

* Ideally you have a supportive partner, parent or friend with you for the first few days to week. It really helps to have someone you love take care of you and all things things that still need to get done around the house, dog walks, etc. Plan for this in advance if you don't have a support system where you live!
* Pain meds (lol), laxative, (fiber pills and pre/probiotic optional but recommended for gut/GI support)
* Comfy sweatpants/loose pants or shorts depending on weather. Personally I like high-waisted and would just pull them up above my incisions (which were all belly button high). Loose is key!
* Lidocaine Patches for the first week (+ silicone tape for scarring once incision site is fully closed, plus to use before applying lidocaine patch)
* A couple good shows with lots of seasons (personally, I watched lots of shows (or tried to) but RuPaul's Drag Race was my absolute favorite - I'm hooked!)
* Good books - I read two during my time off work!
* A couple of your favorite snacks and foods.
* I recommend oatmeal in the mornings as it is hearty but helps with digestion/getting things going (which you will need post surgery). Coffee/caffeine also helps :)
* Optional: Coloring Book to switch it up. Nice easy activity for the morning. If not coloring, something easy and creative. I also crocheted an entire tote bag while watching RuPaul.

I hope this helps some of you!!

The scent of coffee made her flare her nostrils and lick her lips. The pungent aroma mixed with the dream that even now, in the first few seconds of consciousness, had faded, leaving her with its vague impression. In its wake was that familiar emptiness of having been robbed. She knew the setting from past episodes. The tiny parcel of land stuck between Ronan and Hot Springs. A decaying trailer house surrounded by winter wheat fields. They called it a farm with irony, for it possessed only a small garden, untouched for years, and a chicken coop that hadn’t seen occupants since the last owners. Neither she nor her father had a green thumb, nor were they any good with animals.

If not in this dream, then in her memories, he was always out working on the truck. His laptop on the picnic table he’d dragged up next to the rig was connected to a data port under the hood via a long cord, his red toolbox open like a surgical tray, an array of useful tools at hand as he attempted to decode the error messages on the jerry-rigged grid interface. He would run a hand through a shock of ginger hair, starchy from sweat and grease, leaving it to stand on end as a flag of his frustration. He had loved the truck, loved the mechanical work when it had an internal combustion engine. Now, he was always stressed, and he drank and smoked too much, forced to give up diesel for electric, forced to choose desperate and dangerous routes as the grid of autonomous shipping continued to expand.

Coffee was their solace. They would sit together on the porch in the early mornings before the world woke up. Under the twilight of the Big Sky, they’d listen to music or nothing, watching the dippers rotate over the Mission Mountains, year by year fading against the urban sprawl, rarely speaking, like silent monks at morning prayers.

This was a past that was dead. She resented how it followed her slumber in images and in her waking life as an angry longing. She yearned for those untarnished years when he had tried to make everything golden by encouraging a belief in things like Christmas or the ritual of baking a turkey once a year.

She needed to pee.

A faint morning blue from the small, rectangular window illuminated the pile of clothes that was the Greta in the corner of the room. The voiceless woman slept in her patchwork dress and mask. She wondered about her. She must have sustained those scars in the fire. What had that been, like fifteen years ago? The gathering of a hundred thousand Gretas in a field east of Modesto. One hundred thousand women covered in dry polyester and cotton on a dry day under a high sun. How the fire started remained a mystery, full of conspiracy and accusations, but a rogue spark carried by the Santa Ana winds caught a sleeve or a hem, a shawl or cowl, and not one could scream to warn the others. It had been on the news for weeks. The large gatherings stopped after that. These days, the ritualistic cuttings—to take the voice away in solidarity with the Earth Mother—were done in small, secret gatherings with security details carrying firearms.

She pulled on the leggings she’d discarded on the floor next to the bed along with the oversized t-shirt bearing the logo of a brand she didn’t recognize and let herself out of the room. She crept down the hall and closed the bathroom door behind her. When she was done, she tiptoed by the room where Carter Nash bunked with Bridger. The two men had become fast friends. Last night, she’d fallen asleep to their muffled voices. It was good to hear them laugh.

In addition to the two bedrooms and the bathroom, the basement of Katelyn’s house had a living room where the boys were passed out on a plush sofa from another era. It was planted in front of a giant television running a soundless cartoon of a cat chasing a mouse. In their peaceful slumber, Ty had an arm flopped over Francis, who had kicked a leg over Ty, at least one scar upon each puppish limb. She pulled the French doors together, separating them from the kitchen and her quest for coffee.

The kitchen-dining room was done up like an old 1950s diner, complete with the black and white checkered floor and a corner booth where Alan now slept in a forced crescent, an empty wine bottle on the table above him.

She watched him in the morning glow from another small window covered with azure curtains, worried that her movement could wake him up. The man wasn’t so much a drunk—it was that he drank to fall asleep. Her father was like that, toward the end. Christ, she’d done it, too. Something about haunted dreams… No, it was the memories, not the dreams, haunted memories, or rather memories that haunt, that was what kept you awake at night. Nonetheless, the wine-drunk sleep was deepest in the early hours before waking with a pounding headache, so she proceeded on her coffee mission with confidence.

The cupboard revealed a small package of Ceylon teabags wrapped in cellophane and another bottle of wine. She didn’t know if Alan had taken the house wine or if he’d brought it from the Jiffy Stop.

She put on her shoes and went up to the backyard. The brightness of the morning and a nip of frost made her eyes water. Behind the house was a covered patio full of shelves crammed with items that looked as though they could have been contenders in an antique roadshow. Two barbecues, one large and green, the other black, smaller and older by maybe fifty years, were dusted with snow. She stepped past these out from under the roof and lit a cigarette.

A large cottonwood rose from the center of the yard, its branches reaching into the gray sky like skeletal arms. From behind the tree, the little mop dog pranced around and kicked up snow like it had just taken a crap.

“Moby!” Katelyn called from the screen door. “Oh, I didn’t see you there, dear. Ms. Wolf, is it?”

“Just Gwen is fine,” said Gwen. “I thought I’d come up and get the circulation going.”

“Ah yes, the circulation of the humors. Cycles, circles, the repetition of things. It makes perfect sense. You were an early riser in your girlhood. Not afraid of cancer either, it seems.”

Gwen looked at her cigarette.

The woman stepped out in her robe and slippers. From one of the boxes, she retrieved an empty dog food can and set it on the tray of the black barbecue. “Don’t throw your butts in the yard. And maybe smoke by the back gate. Come on, Moby.” She picked up the dog and headed back inside. At the door, she turned. “My manners. I suppose I could offer you some coffee. I just started a pot. Come on in if you like. Mind your shoes.”

***

They sat in the dainty living room. Next to her, the large tabby, aptly named Moose, colonized half the sofa. When she tried to pet him, he woke from his coma long enough to take a half-hearted swing at her with his claws. The mop dog sat in the corner, eyeing her and issuing small growls now and then under its breath. She sipped from a dainty coffee cup, the darkest, richest coffee she’d ever tasted. It scalded her tongue, and the caffeine surged to her head.

“This is amazing coffee,” said Gwen.

“It’s nothing, dear. I’ll give you some to take downstairs. There should be a coffee pot underneath the sink. I had a boarder once, but he—” She stopped herself and studied Gwen. “Never mind him. It’s all about the quality of the ingredients and the care taken in preparation. I doubt your generation will ever understand that.”

“I suppose.” She thought it better to change the subject. “It’s a lovely little house.”

“It’s old. It’s falling apart. I’ve been here most of my life. It is my prison.”

“Well, at least you have a house. No one can afford one anymore.”

“You won’t believe what it took me to get this.” Katelyn’s voice rose with emotion. “Are you married?”

“No.”

“Then as a single woman, you know how we need to fight. No one ever handed me anything.”

She took another sip of the strong brew.

Against the far wall by the door was an upright piano stacked with books. To avoid the awkward conversation, she rose and inspected them. The pages of the one she picked up and opened were aged brown and brittle, written in an alphabet she’d never seen.

“It’s ancient Sami. From the top of the world.”

Gwen jumped. The woman stood next to her. She hadn’t heard her get up. She took the book from her hands and returned it to its place.

“You won’t find any of that smut you read in this house.”

“What makes you think I read smut?”

A furious tension crossed Katelyn’s face. “It’s very old.”

“What’s it about?”

“A ren carries a princess between the realms of the dead and the living.”

“A ren?”

“Reindeer.”

“It sounds interesting.”

“It’s magnificent.” Katelyn’s wrinkled hand touched the leather cover, as if to reassure the tome it was safe from the ignorant.

On the wall above the piano was a series of glass shelves populated with miniature glass figurines of children, some of them fishing, some of them angels.

She leaned in to get a closer look. A small mermaid in blue and yellow crystal appeared to gleam with a light of its own.

“Don’t touch them. They’re so delicate.”

“Trust me, I won’t.”

The old woman sighed at this reproach and returned to her rocking chair. “You’re the first guest I’ve had in… a long time.”

There were other shelves with dark, titleless books and knickknacks such as the resin statuette of a crimson dragon and a pair of neatly beaded baby booties. A large oil painting of a boat out at sea occupied the wall where any normal person would have put a television. Next to it, by the kitchen, hung the watercolor portrait of a beautiful woman, incomplete or never meant to be finished.

“Is this you?”

“Oh, that?” Katelyn placed a proper hand upon her chest. “Once upon a time, I suppose.”

The artist had captured a sense of grace and beauty, lips that could have been ravished by a lover and the flesh of a full breast and naked shoulder. It was in the eyes that she recognized her—dark, intense, furious.

“Who was the artist?” Gwen asked.

“You are a good cop. Full of questions,” said Katelyn.

Gwen turned to see her set her cup on the delicate glass saucer that rested on the delicate glass coffee table. “I’m not a cop anymore.”

“I realize. My brother told me of the situation.”

“Thank you for helping us.”

A stress wrinkle crossed her brow. “Help?” She laughed. “I would hardly call it help.”

“What I mean is, you gave us a place to stay. We really appreciate that. _I_ really appreciate that.”

“We do what we can. I just hope nothing happens.”

The noise of a car engine on the street caused her to get up and open the blinds just a sliver. “Come here,” she said. “Look. Do you recognize that car?”

An old beater was cruising down the street. “I don’t. Looks like some kids out joyriding.”

Katelyn let the blinds fall. “Do you really think that’s all it is?”

“Can I be frank with you?” Gwen asked.

“Obviously, you can be frank with me,” replied the woman.

“We’ve just been through a shitstorm.”

Katelyn chuckled. “You think you’re through it?”

“I’m fully aware—”

“You’re Maji now.”

“Pardon?”

“The boy down there…” Katelyn pointed at the floor. “…is a freak.”

“Excuse me?” said Gwen, immediately defensive of Francis. “He’s just a boy.”

The woman cackled, causing the dog to turn a nervous circle on the floor and the cat to lift its head.

“We were attacked. Francis—”

“Oh, he didn’t consent to it, but that’s what he is. And White Owl is using him like she uses everybody else.”

“White Owl?”

“The great White Owl. Sorceress from beyond the Veil. She’ll wring you out, and when you’re dry, she’ll ask you why you couldn’t do more.”

“So she’s real.”

“Real? A real cunt. I could tell you a hundred things that are as real as the nose at the end of your face, but you’d never believe them.”

“Give me one.”

“You are Maji. Ma-jee, Ma-hi. However one chooses to pronounce it. Or choose another name. We are known by many, but we’re all the same.”

“I’m me. Scots Irish—”

“You heard his music?” Again, she pointed to the floor.

“How does that mean anything?” asked Gwen.

“It’s in you now, and you can never take it out.”

“Fine. I heard his music. It doesn’t change anything. We need to clear our names.”

“It changes everything. Now you are the hunted.”

“The wolves?”

“They’re not wolves. Please, show some respect for Canis lupus.”

“The hunters. That’s what Francis calls them.”

“And you are the prey.” She was wringing her hand nervously.

“I should go. The others are probably getting up.”

Katelyn closed her eyes. Heretofore, her hair had been tied in a tight bun atop her head. She removed a pin and let it fall. It streamed across her bosoms and onto her lap. It was mostly black infused with strands of gray. The old woman was handsome, regal; no doubt she’d been breathtaking in her youth.

“Dear, I’m sorry. Listen, LJ brought you here because he didn’t know what else to do with you. I said I would help. I know you were a cop. I respect that. I’m going to dump some information on you and hope you can process it.”

“I’ll try,” said Gwen.

Katelyn poured them more coffee. “Woman to woman. Maji to Maji. Certain times in our lives, it is necessary to suspend our disbelief.”

“I’ve seen a lot as a cop,” said Gwen.

“I trust you have. I am Maji, as are my people going back into stories that are long forgotten. We have always known fear, and we’ve been taught how to hide and how to control our urges. But there are places and times on this earth when we can weave our enchantments without fear of attack. Auspicious days such as equinoxes and solstices, and other days that would seem random to you, but rest assured they are not random in the least. These are precious few. Once or twice in a lifetime. But that is enough, right? Not every living moment needs to be infested with magic. Once or twice to witness the great sublime. It must be this way as a matter of survival.

“About twenty years ago, something changed, and I wasn’t the only one to notice it. A group of young people who were not of Maji blood started to show symptoms. As they neared puberty, they began to manifest certain traits, the most concerning being the ability to pull from the Veil. This is what alerted them to the hunters.”

“Pulling from the Veil? What does that mean?”

“The Veil is of the primal matter. There are physicists and philosophers of our kind who can give you more sophisticated answers, assuming you can track them down. For our purposes, we just need to understand that it augments our… abilities. But like setting a beacon, it alerts other forces of the Maji’s whereabouts.”

“The hunters?”

“Indeed, and other… agents, other Maji. Don’t think for a moment that just because someone has Maji blood, they are your friend.

“The first person I met who exhibited these traits was a girl by the name of Marissa. She was a young, beautiful climate refugee living in a slum on the outskirts of the BAT. She had a way with animals. She could enter their minds and see through their eyes. She had no idea she was pulling from the Veil. I felt her very first enchantment wash over me like a tsunami. I found her easily enough and begged her to stop. But I was too late. To enchant is an addiction. A few nights later, her magic did stop, but not of her own volition. The hunters found her. They nailed her to the wall and pounded iron stakes through her eyes.”

“Jesus.”

“The newspapers called it gang violence. Not inaccurate, I suppose. Such extremes ensure death. There are others like her. I fear for them, but I also fear finding them. They are getting smarter as they develop, better at controlling their enchantments. From time to time, I sense their ripples, and often after, their signatures end forever. No doubt at the hand of the hunters.”

“How many?”

“It’s hard to say. In Billings alone, I have felt the presence of at least a hundred unique signatures. How many come from the old Maji bloodlines, and how many have… developed? It’s impossible to determine without conducting the kind of research that will get me killed.”

“What do you mean, ‘research?’” Gwen asked.

Katelyn looked at her fiercely. “Research. It’s a matter of developing your sensitivities. You ought to try it. I had a partner once, a woman by the name of Lethe Vonnix. It was she who discovered the link between the Maji and the Escape drug.”

“Wait,” said Gwen. “Vonnix? Dr. Lethe Vonnix?”

“You know of her?”

“Black hair, white face, looks kind of like a ghost?”

“Exactly like a ghost. You’ve met her?” asked Katelyn, leaning in toward Gwen.

“She found Alan and me at a Halloween party up in Polson.”

“Oh, she’s a tenacious investigator, takes the ethnographic approach to fieldwork. She thinks she’s fucking Indiana Jones. She’s as old as me, you know. Makes you want to book her plastic surgeon in advance. Yes, we were research partners once upon a time. We did sorrowful work back then with the Viking and White Owl. But in the end…” The woman trailed off, her dark eyes sparkling and remembering. “In the end, we could not get over certain stumbling blocks. I’m sorry to be vague. Perhaps another time. May I ask, what did Lethe want?”

“I remember,” said Gwen, “she wanted to know how Alan intended to help Francis.”

“Of course. The boy concerns her greatly. The fact that she has taken the risk and returned to the United States, no doubt drawn here by White Owl’s activities, is ominous news.”

“You said the Escape drug turns someone into a Maji?” Gwen inquired.

“There’s a strain, dark work indeed. We suspected a chemist from the Den, perhaps the Sisters, but we couldn’t verify it. The addict must be pregnant.”

“Not of Maji blood,” Gwen echoed Katelyn’s words.

The woman nodded gravely. “Freaks. I do not approve. But what can be done? These new Maji stumble into their so-called chants and fuck up, pardon my language, before they even realize what they’ve done. No one is there to teach them how to behave with their abilities. No one is there to teach them how to hide.” She laughed. “Vonnix is calling herself a doctor now, eh? Back then, Lethe took it upon herself to help these poor creatures. She got into some very deep trouble with the Den. I suggest you avoid her at all costs.”

“What’s the Den?” said Gwen, “And who are the Sisters?”

“Oh, officer, my, my, you really are in over your head. In very simple terms, the Den is where the hunters come from, and the Sisters are a sect therein. That’s neither here nor there, dear. Politics, you know. You can no more influence the machinations of the Den than you can the war between the Western Allies and FEEN. Our job is to stay alive.”

“How many… Escape Maji are there?” asked Gwen. Bridger’s wife had died due to her Escape addiction. This must be why the hunters wanted Ty.

“It’s hard to say. Hundreds? Thousands?”

“But Francis can help them. You should have seen the sheriff’s station that night. They came, so many. They needed him.”

“That boy’s music—” Katelyn pointed down. “It’s a double-edged sword. His music will encrypt—I believe that’s the word White Owl uses—but it will also infect people who are clean. People like you.”

“You talk like it’s a disease.”

“Isn’t it a goddamn disease?”

“If it’s a disease, then Francis is the cure,” said Gwen.

“No, he just makes the sickness harder to find, that’s all. Most Maji will never pull from the Veil in their entire lives. Their enchantments consist of growing record-winning squash or causing harmless pulses of light to infest translucent objects, reading the stars, cozy magic. You get the picture. Still, they may be hunted and killed. There is no justice in this world… or beyond.”

Outside on the street, the car was back revving its engine. Katelyn jerked the blinds open. Moby snarled and raised his hackles; the cat slept on.

“What are you afraid of?”

“My dear, there’s a lot to be afraid of when you are the hunted.”

“Yeah.” She sipped her coffee. They were being hunted. Now, like the fawn in the forest, they were lying low.

“The Chaos,” said Katelyn. “This is the real fear, the existential threat. That is when the Veil falls, when suffering is at the most, when nothing makes sense, and a ruler of darkness prevails.

“Jesus, it’s every bad horror movie I ever watched as a kid.”

“I’m quoting scripture, dear. It’s dogma in the Den. It is the righteous cause of the Sisters and their hunters. You need to know your enemies.”

“Yesterday, at the Jiffy Stop, Francis said he would pull from the Veil to help Ty. And that hunters would come.”

“And you fled, and you’re here. It’s been the plight of the Maji for longer than there’s time to tell.”

“I was never religious,” said Gwen.

Katelyn lifted her dainty coffee cup in salute. “Today, I will make fake IDs for everyone. I have a feeling you’re going to need them.”

“You’ll do them?”

“Of course. I make the best fake IDs. A gal needs a side hustle.”

The car’s music thumped through the walls.

The old woman jumped to her feet, threw open the door, raised her fist, and shouted, “People are trying to sleep!”

“Fuck you, lady,” one of the kids shouted, and the music faded down the block.",0,1739926084.0,HFY,2,0.5,False

Today I paid $5 with tip to get a black coffee with syrup from Foolish Craig's and it was legitimately not warm. Keep in mind it has been around 15 degrees today. I feel that black coffee is the most basic item to serve in a cafe and it should not be COLD. I've not had much better experiences at Laughing Goat. Prices are INSANE for the quality that they are serving. You can tell that their coffee has also been sitting around in the pot all day. My roommate bought a mocha yesterday that was more expensive than their signs advertised. It came out to $8 for a 12 oz iced mocha, which is like twice the price of STARBUCKS. She also said it was bad. 

But the worst one is the cafe that's replaced Pekoe. The last time I got a coffee from there, I noticed that their announcement that they were increasing prices. That would be fine if they were making better coffee to compensate. Not the case. The barista said to me ""There's a lot of grounds in this coffee. Do you want me to remake it?"" What??? 

In Boulder you would expect high quality coffee and probably prices to match that but these places are serving gas station quality. Please tell me this isn't just me and my roommate. ",19,1739926017.0,cuboulder,10,1.0,False

1isscep,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1isscep/aitah_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_mil_and/,AITAH for setting boundaries with my MIL and voicing how I feel finally?,"Okay, my MIL and I seemed to always have an okay relationship. She was happy when my husband and I first got together and the first thing she said about me was that I had ""childbearing hips,"" and would make for a good spouse. 

A few months into dating my boyfriend (now husband) his parents divorced. It was a very hard time for all, especially my boyfriend and his brother. Both of their parents kind of went ""off the rails,"" a bit. His mom was a stay at home mom since she was pregnant with my husband and got 600k from the divorce and does not/will not work. 

My boyfriend and I sided more with his mom on the divorce as we felt very bad for her. Not only was she going through a divorce she lost her father who she was very close with and she herself has some health issues. When my boyfriend and I went to finally move out on our own she very generously gifted us 12k to assist with our move and to have money as a ""safety net.""

Boyfriend and I lived together and about 4 years into dating got engaged. Mil was very excited as the next step was grandchildren once the wedding was done. We got married after 5 years of dating and I fell pregnant very shortly after that (I think it was three months after we got married). 

We told MIL as well as my mom who were both very excited, but it was around this time it felt like her behavior towards me changed. 

Anytime she talked about the expected baby she always called it ""my baby,"" which I didn't think much of at first. We invited them over for breakfast and were discussing babys arrival. I told her that we would call them when I was in labor, but I really only wanted my husband in the room. We were eating brunch at the time at my husband's and Is home and she ""accidently,"" spilled her piping hot coffee on me. I said ""ow!"" And got up trying to pat at the coffee stain with a towel and she looked at me and asked ""what's wrong?"" Not noting she had spilled coffee all over me. 

After this she asked my husband many times if she could be in the room and for him to force me to have her in the room. As the time got closer I asked my husband if it would be okay to have my mom in the room during birth to provide support and he said ""of course, you're the one birthing a whole human."" 

When the time came and I was in labor I had my mom and husband both with me. We called my MIL to let her know and she immediately had her partner drive her up and sat in the waiting room where she saw my step-dad waiting. She called me and asked if my mom was in the room. I told her ""yes."" She said I was being unfair and she needed to be there too as my mom should not hold ""her baby,"" first. 

I ended up agreeing as I felt bad and did not want to be acting like a bitch or jip her out of experiencing babies arrival. 

She joined us in the room and the entire time she was there was making comments towards me. She told me I was taking to long in labor, That her back hurt, that she was tired, etc. She finally said ""well, if it's going to take this long I'm getting a hotel room. Call me when my baby arrives.""

Well the time came and I was about to push. We called her and got VM so my husband called her partner. He said she was sleeping and he was not going to wake her. We said okay. They arrived about an hour after baby arrived and I passed baby over to her. A few minutes after the nurses took baby from her for their shots. MIL and her partner left and went home. Very shortly after I signed onto FB and saw that her partner had posted a photo of baby even though my husband was adamant about not posting babys photos online yet. 

When I got Discharged from the hospital we let them know asap and they drove over to our house. I was told I needed to apologize to MIL because she did not get to hold baby as long since the nurse took them for their shots. I did apologize and moved on as I did not feel like it was worth arguing over. 

Mil was constantly making comments about my parenting and would refer to herself as ""mama,"" when speaking to baby. Husband and I both WFH and needed some assistance with baby a big and asked MIL if she would like to come help and we would pay her as well as drive her back and forth since she cannot drive well. The only ask we had of her was that she not walk a ton with baby since her knees have bad issues and she falls a lot. Our other request was that she did not vape while holding the baby and to not talk badly about her ex-husband as we don't want that type of crap talking around little ears.

Well she was adamant about doing both of those things anytime she thought we were not looking. I saw her fall with baby in arms and then try lying about it. We also saw her vaping while holding baby many times. We have a camera in our livingroom, from the corner of my eye I saw her take a puff from her vape. I told my husband and when he addressed it she said I was lying. He said we have a camera in the livingroom (which was no secret, we have had it for years long before ever having kids) and he asked if she wanted him to look at the footage. She said he was invading her privacy and she would not be treated that way. 

Later that night (she was sleeping in our guest room) we heard her hysterically crying and screaming on the phone. It was 2am and we lived in under 900sq ft so sound travels pretty well. My husband knocked on the door and asked if she was okay. She replied that he was disrespectful and should mind his own business. He left and came back into our bedroom. 

My husband's grandma (mils mom) called us asking why we are treating mil poorly. She said she is also concerned for our babys safety. Mil lied to her and said that we don't allow her to read to baby and kept baby locked in a box all day (neither of these were true). When we asked mil she denied it. 

Adding in here too, husband and I go to marriage therapy. We had a lot of issues in our marriage prior to it even beginning. He came to me saying he had a major p*rn addiction and wanted help for it. We have shared this with mil and she laughed saying ""all men do it, what's the issue?"" Not taking into account that her son was the one wanting help for it himself. 

One day when we returned from therapy she kept asking what we talked about. Husband said he talked about potentially reconnecting with his dad. She blew up on him saying he was a bad son to her for wanting to do this and then proceeded to continue crap talk husband's dad. 

A few days later she said she was feeling dizzy. This is a regular occurrence she is on a unholy amount of meds for many different things. We took her blood pressure and it was very scary high. Husband and I talked and decided instead of having her for 5 days we would cut it back to 2-3 as we were worried about her health. She yelled at us for suggesting this and said we were taking away her only joy in life (our baby). 

Later that day she started yelling at us again, she said we were not being fair to her. This is where I definitely was the AH I started yelling back at her. To which she said she would not be disrespected by having me yell at her and that I was a child and she was an adult and I needed to listen to her. She called her partner asking him to leave his job and come pick her up saying no one wanted to talk to her or communicate to which I replied ""you're a fucking liar!!! All I have. Done is try talking to you! I always ask for your opinion on things and you never tell me how you feel, I am DONE!"" My husband offered to drive her home so her partner would not have to leave work. When she was leaving I told her that I was sorry for yelling, but I could not continue to let her walk all over me and treat me any way she wants. 

A month passed after not talking with her or seeing her. She reached out acting like nothing had happened and brought up our babies bday party. I told her she was still invited but there was not going to be any drama or hostility during it, she agreed. 

We had the party and she was fairly nice during it. I thought everything was fine. My husband's brother called us saying ""mom called me, and I know what she said isn't true, so can you tell me what really happened?"" I was very confused. He said she called him saying she never got to hold baby, and that when she finally did my mom ripped baby from her hands. That was not even close to what happened. She held baby for about an hour, baby got fussy so she passed him to my husband (dad), husband could not get baby to calm down do he passed baby to me and left to make a bottle. My mom walked over to me and asked if she could feed baby, I said yes, and passed baby to her. His brother said that sounded more accurate. Her mom (mils mom) called us asking the same thing using the same words. 

Instead of confronting MIL we just decided to go Low contact for a bit as I didn't even know what to say to her. A few days later I got a ""follow request,"" on Instagram from an account called ""shunned-mil,"" the account had also sent me some very hateful messages. I was unsure who's it was at first but then saw a photo of MILs dog with her home in the background which told me exactly who it was. I showed husband who wanted to call and yell at her and I told him to not worry about it. Per his request I blocked that account as well as her normal Instagram account that already followed me. 

She would randomly text us stuff from time to time but husband and I would just not respond or give one word responses. After a few months of this it stopped all together. 

At the start of this year my husband's grandfather (FILs dad) died. That same day mil called husband and left a VM saying ""someone better be dead or gravely ill for you to not be answering my phone calls!"" He texted her saying his grandfather died and she said she was sorry and she loved his grandfather but she wanted her answers still. 

The next day he called her and told her everything. He told her that he did not like that she constantly ignored what we asked when it came to our child (no vaping/limited walking/not crap talking his dad). He didn't like that she lied about us to family (keeping son in box and limiting reading as well as the lie about my mom) she denied all of it and said it never happened. He said well ""brother and your mom said, xyz."" To which she replied ""well I didn't think I would have to tell them not to tell you what I said!"" He also talked with her about the Instagram account and she denied it saying that I was lying and trying to ruin the relationship she has with her son. He said he saw the account and the photo of her dog on it and she said ""what do you want me to say??? That I did it??? FINE I DID IT!!! ARE YOU HAPPY??"" She started hysterically crying and said she was also pissed I blocked her on insta which my husband reminded her was only because she had sent me harrasing messages from a fake Instagram, he said he had to get back to work and hung up. 

Since then she tried texting me asking what she had done wrong. I just wrote to her saying that we were both very hurt and needed time to heal from it. I told her we do love her but she cannot treat us that way as its not nice. That regardless of if she liked it or not that I was babys mom, not her so she did need to consider what we say as well. I again expressed we loved her a lot, and wanted to have active grandparents in our kids life, but we also needed to work on our relationship as DIL and MIL. All she texted back was a Bible verse. 

I am really unsure where to go from here but my husband wants nothing to do with her right now. He has a lot of unhealed child trauma from her as well and this stacking on it has not helped. 

I just wanted to know if we are being the asshole here, if all are the asshole, or if it's just a misunderstanding between all. ",1,1739925859.0,AITAH,18,0.67,False

They have a great pork belly dish and a combo plate that includes 4 of their other dishes. I suggest going with someone so that you can order both plates and try it all. 

They also have sandwiches, salads, boba tea, coffees, ice cream, small selection of prepack foods and condiments, and homemade cakes. 

On Saturdays they have weekly specials, so we will be going back. 

The name means ""let's eat!"". The folks there are really nice.
