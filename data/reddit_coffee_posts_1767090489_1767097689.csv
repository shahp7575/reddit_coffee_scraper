I've been several times and love it, I want to be relatively close to the old town, but somewhere that is in the countryside (and somewhere beautiful) as he much prefers countryside to urban environments. Is this possible? It would be nice if we were close to a mountain / waterfall, and if there were a couple of nice coffee shops or restaurants within walking distance. I had a look on google but I didn't really know where to start.

So here are all of my lipsticks except 2 that I forgot in a drawer before taking the photo. I will finish atleast half of them next year. Hopefully more. I will keep put the oldest ones and if I really hate a color on me and I cant find an alternate use then I will throw it out.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1pzgon7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1pzgon7/how_does_actual_fainting_feel_different_from_a/,How does actual fainting feel different from a panic attack?,"So I’m not a fainter. I’ve fainted nearly twice when I was a teenager and had an ED. Once was in class after climbing the stairs to the top floor after not eating for a whole day and I felt it coming and put my head between my legs and then had a sandwich and I never actually blacked out. 
Second time was when getting out of a hot shower and immediately drying my hair on the hottest setting. Tried to walk to my bedroom across the hall when I went dizzy and actually sprained my ankle cause I fell down in the hall but again never actually lost consciousness.

I’m very very very scared about fainting, even when I’m just at home. I normally never eat breakfast (bad I know) and work in childcare. I barely drink any water during work, I do 2 coffees and if I have time and am really hungry eat a banana before my lunch break but that’s usually only like once every 2 weeks. 

So I’m not really a fainter I guess. I have terrible terrible panic attacks and almost constant silent hyperventilation. And I’ve never fainted. So idk why I’m so scared. Also getting blood drawn or gory images of videos don’t make me faint so I really don’t know why I’m so sure I’ll just faint at any given moment. 

I have constant bouts of dizzyness and lightheadedness and brain fog. Even when I’m not panicking or anxious. 

I guess I just want to know, people who actually are ‘fainters’. Is it as scary as I imagine and why am I so scared of it? I’m at a point where I sometimes wish I would just faint so I actually know what it’s like and maybe the ‘not knowing part’ would ease a bit? 

I’m just tired. 
I had full blood works done about 4 months ago, and had a full heart check up cause I also have cardio phobia and I’m healthy. Slight vitamin D Deficiency but apart from that I have a completely clean bill of health ",2,1767097079.0,PanicAttack,0,1.0,False

Was feeling some sort of way but was encouraged to put myself out there now. My new year’s quest is to make more connections and friends. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/s/G4qszhax4v

I’ve complied a list of things I’d like to do / try this year and I’m looking for mates who’d be keen to join me or hang out! I’m thinking this would be a great way to balance work with my outside social life as I was describing in my old post.

Next year Id like to …

\- Have a go at and become competent at bouldering (thinking indoor gym vibe rather than outdoor)

\- Jam more (I sing) and meet some other musicians to potentially write music with

\- Learn to surf

\- Hit up op shops more and thrift more of my wardrobe and household items

\- Develop a further appreciation for coffee and visit heaps of cafes

\- Go to more football (AFL and soccer haha) games

\- Explore new hiking trails and perhaps dabble in a bit of nature photography

\- Progress more in the gym

\- Potentially pick up running again after a few years and join a run club

Alright - this list seems a bit too basic 😅 but it’s a start ! Reach out if you’d like to go one of these adventures or honestly even if something else comes to mind that you think I’d enjoy let me know!

1pzgm9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1pzgm9b/nunerve_review_6_weeks_can_nanotech_nutrition/,NuNerve Review (6 Weeks) ⚡ Can Nanotech Nutrition Really Relieve Nerve Discomfort?,"# 🌿 Terry Was Pleasantly Surprised ...

Nerve pain is like your body's idea of a prank—annoying, unfunny, and always badly timed.

Whether it’s pins and needles or fiery zaps down your leg, it messes with your day and your sleep. You can’t focus, and even walking barefoot becomes a weird gamble.

I’ve tried a small army of capsules claiming to help. Most ended up living rent-free in my supplement graveyard. But then I [heard about NuNerve](https://theworldhealth.org/try-nunerve-official), a **nerve health support supplement** that uses nano absorption.

I raised an eyebrow—and placed an order.

# 🧾 Product Overview

**Product Name:** NuNerve  
**Category:** Health Supplements → Nerve Support  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.7/5

# 🔍 What Is NuNerve?

NuNerve delivers nutrients that may help rebuild damaged nerves—without wasting them on a trip through your digestive system.

It uses **a nano delivery system designed for neuropathy relief** that breaks ingredients into tiny particles. The goal? Better absorption.

It’s promoted as **the best nerve supplement that uses nanotechnology**—a bold claim, but they do stack it with ingredients known for results.

The blend supports people looking for **nerve pain relief without medication**, and might surprise folks who’ve been burned by gimmicks before.

# 🌿 Key Ingredients Breakdown

This isn’t a random mix of buzzwords. Here’s what’s inside—and why it matters:

* **R-Alpha Lipoic Acid**: Supports nerve cells and balances blood sugar. **For nerves**, **B12 vs alpha lipoic acid** is a common comparison.

🌱

* **Vitamin B12, B6, B1**: Together, they work as **vitamins for nerve pain and regeneration**. You need these if your nervous system is waving a white flag.

🌱

* **Palmitoylethanolamide for nerve pain**: It’s a mouthful, but this natural fatty acid compound may calm inflammation and reduce discomfort.

🌱

* **Lion’s Mane for nerve repair**: The shaggy mushroom with a better memory than most humans. It may [stimulate nerve growth](https://theworldhealth.org/try-nunerve-official) and help with clarity.

🌱

* **Whole Coffee Fruit Extract**: Helps **increase BDNF naturally**, which matters if your nerves feel sluggish.

🌱

* **Organic Curcumin Longa**: Anti-inflammatory and often cited as**as a compound that helps heal nerve damage**. Spoiler: it might.

🌱

* The full combo? Worthy of a “**NuNerve ingredients explained**” video, honestly.

# ⚙️ How It Works: Nano Absorption Explained

This is where things get futuristic. Most supplements throw nutrients at your gut and hope they stick. NuNerve claims to do better by breaking them down so tiny they’re easier to absorb.

People often ask, **does nanotechnology improve supplement absorption**? The theory checks out—smaller bits mean faster use.

That’s where NuNerve positions itself as one of the few **supplements using nano absorption for nerve pain**.

This process might even explain **how nano absorption helps nerve regeneration**. Your cells don’t have to fight to use what’s provided. It’s fast, it’s clean, and it makes NuNerve feel more like fuel than fluff.

# 🧑‍🔬 Terry's Personal Experience ...

A friend of mine, **Terry A**, is a part-time sound engineer who I met through a local vegan co-op we both volunteer at.

Terry spends long hours hunched over mixing boards and carrying heavy gear, and over time, the repetitive strain started messing with the nerves in his hands and forearms.

He’d wake up with that all-too-familiar tingling sensation—pins and needles that overstayed their welcome—and sometimes even had trouble gripping small tools.

He was skeptical of supplements (like, deeply skeptical), but after chatting with me about **natural treatments for nerve damage**, he agreed to [give NuNerve a shot](https://theworldhealth.org/try-nunerve-official).

He kept at it consistently for six weeks. By week three, he told me he noticed less stiffness in the mornings and was sleeping better—not because NuNerve knocked him out, but because the discomfort wasn’t waking him up anymore.

The tingling didn’t vanish completely, but it eased up enough that he could work longer sessions without needing breaks every 20 minutes.

The only real gripe he had? “Capsules taste weird if you forget to eat,” he warned with a laugh. But overall, he’s still taking it—and he doesn’t usually stick to anything unless it *actually* works.

# ⭐ Star Ratings (Out of 5)

* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Effectiveness** – Gradual relief within weeks. Not magic, but measurable progress.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Ingredients** – High-quality components often found in the **best supplements for nerve repair**.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **Ease of Use** – Easy to swallow, but take it with food unless you enjoy herbal flashbacks.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **Absorption** – Thanks to nano tech, here's a **nerve health supplement that absorbs quickly**.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Value** – A little pricey, but fair for the blend and delivery method.

**Average Score: 4.7/5**

# ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons

# Pros

🟢 **Well-studied ingredients known to support nerve healin**g  
🟢 **Uses nanotech to improve absorption and deliver**y  
🟢 Supports those seeking **natural treatments for nerve damag**e  
🟢 Ideal for anyone searching for **supplements for nerve repair that use advanced delivery method**s

# Cons

🔴 **Mild aftertaste if taken without foo**d  
🔴 **Not an instant fix—expect to wait 2–4 week**s  
🔴 **Only sold online—not in physical stores ye**t

# 💬 What Other Users Are Saying

Many reviews read like relief in lowercase. People reported small wins—less tingling, more restful nights, more stable steps. One said it helped them grip a coffee mug without fear.

Another praised its effect on [post-chemo nerve issues](https://theworldhealth.org/try-nunerve-official), calling it “the only thing that did more than take my money.” Many users considered it the **nerve pain supplement with the highest absorption rate**.

While you’ll see the occasional complaint about price or shipping, reviews often agree it's among **supplements for neuropathy relief** worth sticking with.

# ⚠️ Safety and Potential Side Effects

Most users tolerate NuNerve well. Some mention light nausea if taken on an empty stomach. That’s common for **anti-inflammatory supplements for nerves**, especially ones with strong herbs.

No reports of major side effects in forums or buyer comments. That said, don’t mix this with medications without a quick chat with your doctor. Be safe. Your nerves will thank you.

# ⏳ How Long Does It Take to Work?

For most people, this isn’t a quick fix. You’ll need at least two weeks before you feel a shift. Terry hit his stride at week three.

Based on stories I’ve read, the average person begins to notice improvements around 18–30 days. Even **supplements for nerve repair that use advanced delivery methods** still take time to work.

If you want results fast, you’ll probably be frustrated. But if you’re patient, you may be pleasantly surprised.

# 💰 Pricing Options

NuNerve is available in three bundles:

* **1 Bottle** – $69
* **3 Bottles** – $177 ($59 per bottle)
* **6 Bottles** – $294 ($49 per bottle)

You get better value with the larger packs, which makes sense for a **bioavailable supplement for nerve health** you’re likely to take for several weeks.

# 🛒 Where To Buy NuNerve

Only [buy NuNerve online from the official website](https://theworldhealth.org/try-nunerve-official). That’s where you get the 60-day refund guarantee—and peace of mind you’re not buying an expired knockoff in a sketchy bottle.

It’s also the only place to access limited-time pricing on multi-month bundles. Don’t roll the dice elsewhere.

# ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does it help with diabetic nerve pain?**  
A: Some users with diabetes said it eased numbness and tingling. Results vary, but reviews are positive.

**Q: Is this safe with other supplements?**  
A: If you’re taking multiple vitamins, check the B content—NuNerve already covers a lot.

**Q: What makes this different from regular B12 pills?**  
A: The **nano absorption process** and extra ingredients set it apart from basic options.

**Q: Can I stop after symptoms improve?**  
A: Yes. Some cycle off after three months. Others continue for ongoing support.

**Q: Is it vegetarian-friendly?**  
A: Yes. The capsules don’t use gelatin and the ingredients are plant-based.

**Q: Is this good for older adults?**  
A: Many reviews came from folks over 60. It seems to be helpful across age groups.

It's good karma 🙏

1pzgm10,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pzgm10/whats_going_on/,What’s Going On?,"My wife just went through an absolute crazy last month or so and started a mini affair out of nowhere. A lot of things just don’t make sense. 

Below is a timeframe - I’ve tried to include everything I can think of. What mental health issues are happening here?

Background / Long-term context (before Sept)

	1.	Wife experienced a traumatic childhood, including witnessing her father place a pillow over her mother’s face, along with multiple other traumatic incidents

	2.	Wife put very little effort into the marriage over 2025

	5.	Wife knows Florida is my favourite place

⸻

Summer – Florida trip (earlier in the year)

	6.	Wife suffered huge panic attacks in Florida during the summer holiday

	7.	While in Florida in summer, wife needed my help and support and genuinely thanked me

⸻

September

	8.	EMDR and couples therapy started in September to help the relationship and panic attacks

⸻

Mid-November

	9.	After the first EMDR session in November, the mini affair started via a coffee meet and increased messaging (wife stated EMDR had no effect)

	10.	The mini affair was ongoing while couples therapy was progressing in November

	11.	The affair partner was someone inappropriate due to children and not her usual type

	12.	Wife cited feeling “trapped” as a reason for the mini affair

	13.	Wife did not change her phone passcode during the mini affair

⸻

Late November

	14.	There was huge work-related financial stress approximately two weeks before the December trip

	15.	Two weeks at the end of November showed a massive improvement in the relationship and both partners appeared very happy

	16.	During late November and into early December, wife said “I love you a lot” and appeared genuine

⸻

Early December (pre-Florida trip)

	17.	Wife began manufacturing problems and blaming me for things that did not happen as she believed

	18.	Wife dreaded going to Florida on Dec 18th and became very upset, anxious, and close to crying when thinking about it

	19.	Wife blamed me for booking the December trip and said it should have been cancelled, including telling others we could not afford it

	20.	In the week before travelling to Florida, the mini affair escalated and involved three kisses

⸻

Discovery / Exposure

	21.	Wife made the mini affair obvious for me to discover and was unusually forthcoming with the truth

	22.	Immediately after being found out, wife said she wanted a divorce but behaved differently toward me

⸻

Florida – December trip (after discovery)

	23.	Wife was very anxious because two of the children travelled to Florida by themselves

	24.	While in Florida in December, wife’s anxiety was less severe than expected and she began to enjoy herself

	25.	Wife made small offerings in Florida (asking what I wanted to do and if I needed anything), without reconciliation

	26.	While in Florida, wife stated she was not messaging the affair partner but also had not terminated the mini affair

⸻

Post-trip / Current position

	27.	Wife said she wants to talk about the relationship once home, without providing further details",2,1767096852.0,mentalhealth,3,1.0,False
1pzglkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanTechWorkers/comments/1pzglkr/the_h1b_program_is_responsible_for_every_data/,The H1B Program Is Responsible For EVERY Data Breach Ever!,"Ok, so maybe that is not true, but after the Coinbase robbery, it occurred to me that maybe all the data breaches that have happened are the result of people with phony creds being put to work in the US as placeholders while their supposed tasks are done by people in another country. That, plus offshoring the work otherwise, as well.

As Mahvash Siddiqui said in this podcast:  
[https://cis.org/Parsing-Immigration-Policy/Industrialized-Fraud-H1B-Visa-Program](https://cis.org/Parsing-Immigration-Policy/Industrialized-Fraud-H1B-Visa-Program)

As many as 90% of the degrees that visa applicants claimed were from degree-mills in Amerpeet.

Needless to say, there have been a lot of data breaches in the past few years. A few weeks ago I got a letter about one. Another one about a year ago. I think I have perhaps receive four or five total so far, over the years.

It's probably a safe bet that every company that has had data breaches has some H1B workers as well. They may have had their hands on the systems.

Likewise, there may be a connection between that and the scam call centers. How did those scammers get people's phone numbers and email addresses?

This may be a case for a crafty lawyer. Basically negligence. Using unskilled workers on systems that need to be secured. Anybody else here get a mail about a data breach? Ever?

I've flagged the issue, and raised concerns... Let's escalate this to a manager.

1pzgkwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pzgkwo/postponed_my_surgery_due_to_anxiety/,Postponed my surgery due to anxiety,"Hi everyone,

First of all, sorry to be that person. I really need some advice and support. I was originally scheduled for laparoscopic surgery in December for an ovarian cyst, but my anxiety became overwhelming: sleep, appetite, and work were all affected, so I asked my surgeon to postpone it a few weeks to regain control over my mental health. The surgery is now rescheduled for January. I’ve been doing a lot to manage my anxiety, but I still sometimes get scared about general anesthesia. My main worries are reacting badly to medications (allergies to muscle relaxants, malignant hyperthermia, breathing problems because I tend to snore, hallucinating while waking up). I know these fears aren’t entirely rational, so I’d especially appreciate advice from people who have a job in the anaesthesia field and do this on daily basis or personal examples.

Some relevant medical history:

•	I’m a 30-year-old female, BMI 20, I don’t smoke, and I don’t consume alcohol or drugs. Generally healthy apart from generalised anxiety which I had under control until recently.

•	At 13, I had a laparotomy in Eastern Europe for a ruptured appendix under general anaesthesia. Surgery went fine, but I was extremely talkative and silly while waking up.

•	At 14, I had IV sedation for a wisdom tooth extraction. I remember yelling during the procedure and waking up disoriented, talking to another patient in the recovery room. I also had a sedation at 20 for an endoscopy. But I don’t fear sedation, only GA.

I’m also a foreigner in a new country, speak the language at a B1 level, and don’t have family nearby, which adds to my stress.

I’ve been actively working on my wellbeing for the last cuple of weeks:

•	Going on daily 3-hour hikes, sleeping well, drink 2L of water per day, stopped coffee and maintaining a protein-focused diet.

•	Taking supplements: multivitamin (trusted brand, within recommended dosages), vitamin B12, vitamin D (I had a mild deficiency), 200 mg magnesium (bisglycinate), 500 mg omega-3, 45mg Iron bisglycinate (recent blood work shown ferritin and haemoglobin towards the lower normal limit and I had a history with iron deficiency) and 100 mg L-theanine before sleep.

•	Practicing meditation, breathing exercises, weight lifting, and doing fun activities like playing with my dog and karaoke.

I’m usually a very active person, and this routine has helped a lot, but I still sometimes get scared about the thought of surgery and general anesthesia. I really want this surgery done, since the cyst is quite big and I risk ovarian torsion.

I’d be so grateful for any advice and encouragement since I haven’t been able to talk in person to any anaesthesiologist at the hospital.

One last thing - my surgeon said it’s fine to take all the supplements but if you consider otherwise please let me know. Especially for the L theanine - I couldn’t find any evidence in the scientific literature that it could interfere with general anesthesia drugs.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I've been having these muscle twitching problems for a long time and, even with my health anxiety, I've managed to accept that it's just caused by my anxiety and not something dangerous. Which is good, but sadly it's still annoying. The body twitches I can do with it, but there are times when my lower eyelid (left one) keeps twitching, i sometimes feel it all the way in my cheek and I get other weird feelings at the same times like shivers if that makes sense. It's most likely anxiety related too, linked with a very bad sleep (that I can't do anything about for now). My question is, how do you deal with it? Are there ways to maybe reduce it, knowing I can't have a better sleep for now? I rarely drink tea (like maybe once every two weeks or so) and never coffee, i don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, I try to drink water regularly... I don't know what to do.

Also additional question, I'm on betablockers (for anxiety too). I'm not planning on stopping them without medical advice but I'm wondering if some people who took them also noticed things like that under that treatment or if it doesnt have any impact on it ?

Velvetiser is clean, no visible issues with whisk, happens with both whole and semi-skimmed milk and am filling not above the max line.

1pzgfu6,https://i.redd.it/s696euji0cag1.png,"Can USA / Canadian Gaggia Coffee machines be used in the UAE, Saudi & GCC?","Short answer: **No — they’re not suitable for direct use.**

Here’s why 👇

Electricity in the **UAE, Saudi Arabia, and the wider GCC** runs on **220–240V at 50Hz**.  
  
Most **USA/Canadian coffee machines** (including Gaggia models) are built for **110–120V at 60Hz**.

Using a North American model in the GCC would require a **step-down transformer** and still comes with risks:

* ❌ Frequency mismatch (60Hz vs 50Hz) can affect pumps, motors, and electronics
* ❌ Reduced performance and shortened lifespan
* ❌ Safety concerns
* ❌ Manufacturer warranty is usually void outside the intended region

Even with a transformer, the machine will **not operate as designed**.

# The right solution

Gaggia manufactures **230V / 50Hz versions** specifically for Europe, the Middle East, and GCC countries. These:

* Match local power standards perfectly
* Don’t require adapters or transformers
* Are safe, stable, and warranty-covered

# Recommendation

If you’re in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, or anywhere in the GCC, always choose the **230V / 50Hz Gaggia model**.

We’re an **authorized Gaggia coffee machine team for the GCC**, and we strongly advise against using USA/Canadian models in this region.

Posting this here in case it helps someone avoid an expensive mistake.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1pzgdnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur/comments/1pzgdnd/keeping_track_of_tiktok_influencers_turned_out_to/,Keeping Track of Tiktok Influencers Turned Out to Be Harder Than Expected,"We recently found ourselves in need of keeping track of our TikTok influencer marketing efforts (efforts being emails, spreadsheets, reminders to ourselves, and vague mental notes that we were definitely going to follow up later (we did not)). This felt like quite a big moment for us (not literally), mostly because we are usually very organized people (organized meaning “good at B2B things”).

Admittedly, we had not done a huge amount of research into the tools already available out there (research meaning we Googled a bit, clicked around, sighed, and made coffee). The first four tools we looked at were either very expensive (numbers with commas) or did not have pricing listed at all, which always makes us feel slightly nervous (financially and emotionally).

A bit of background (this may help, or it may not): we are historically B2B people. Enterprise-y. Dashboards. Long sales cycles. That sort of thing. Recently, however, we decided to do an app (an actual app, for actual people), which meant dipping our toes into B2C waters. The water was colder than expected (metaphorically).

Because of this, we needed something simple to track influencers. Who we contacted. Who replied. Who said “sounds great!” and then disappeared into the digital fog (not literally). We assumed there must be a lightweight tool for this already. There probably is. We just didn’t find one that felt right (right meaning affordable, clear, and not yelling at us with too many features).

So we built a small internal tool instead. Nothing fancy. Just the basics. Then we looked at it and thought, “Other founders might find this useful” (founders being people like us, slightly tired, mildly optimistic, and trying to keep track of things).

We decided to open source it.

It’s free.

No strings attached (there are genuinely no strings, invisible or otherwise).

You can self-host it.

You can fork it.

You can ignore it entirely if you want (that’s also fine).



We’re sharing it here in case it helps someone else who is:

new to influencer marketing

new to B2C

allergic to surprise pricing

or just likes simple tools that do one thing and stop

There was a total disconnect. I was selling a feeling (luxury isolation) in text but showing a mechanical feature in video.

The problem is, I live in a flat in the city. I can't fly to the Swiss Alps or hike a glacier just to get one ""hero shot"" of the coffee maker in its intended element.

So I started testing this ads agent workflow. Instead of editing boring stock footage of people drinking generic coffee, I fed it the specific ""outcome"" angle I wanted (visceral textures, steam, high-altitude chill) plus the static supplier photos. It generated a video concept that actually visualizes the heat against the cold rather than just showing the item on a white background.

It's not perfect—the render times are kinda slow (\~8-10 mins) and you have to be specific about the textures—but being able to test 4 different ""environments"" (Snow vs. Desert vs. Forest) without buying a plane ticket or hiring a videographer saved my week.

CTR is up about 1.5% on the ""Snow"" test ad set specifically.

I wish this was a metaphor. It’s not

Three months ago I was borrowing my cousin’s phone to look something up. She unlocked it and a text came in from her friend asking “is that your screw up cousin with you”

I laughed it off in the moment like it was a joke. She laughed too, awkwardly. But when she handed me the phone back I caught a glimpse of the contact name.

My name wasn’t saved as my name.

It was saved as “the screw up.”

I’m 24. That’s what people close enough to me were calling me when they didn’t think I’d see.

That was the moment I realized my reputation was already written and it was not a good one.

For years I had been the person everyone felt sorry for. Dropped out of college twice. Worked random jobs for a few months then quit. Always “figuring things out.” Always saying I had a plan. Never actually doing anything.

Family events were brutal. People would ask how I was doing, not because they cared, but because it was polite. The second I gave a vague answer they’d nod and move on to talk to someone whose life made sense.

My parents never said it out loud but I could feel it. That quiet disappointment. That feeling that I was the kid they worried about when they went to sleep.

Friends from high school stopped inviting me places. Not out of malice, just because I had nothing going on. It’s uncomfortable to be around someone who is stuck when you are moving forward.

I spent most days in my room scrolling, gaming, sleeping at weird hours. Telling myself I was just taking a break or waiting for motivation to come back.

Deep down I knew the truth. I was hiding. From responsibility, from failure, from the possibility that I might try and still not be good enough.

The shame was constant but quiet. Not dramatic, just this background hum of knowing I was wasting my life and everyone could see it but me.

After seeing that contact name I went home and sat on my bed for a long time. Didn’t scroll. Didn’t distract myself. Just sat there replaying it.

The screw up. That was my brand.

And the worst part was I had earned it.

That night I did something I had never done before. I stopped asking how to feel better and started asking how to change my situation.

I didn’t suddenly become disciplined. I didn’t wake up motivated. I didn’t have a big inspiring moment.

I was just tired of being a joke.

I started brutally honest. I wrote down what my life actually looked like.

Waking up around noon. Zero routine. No exercise. Eating whatever was easiest. No progress toward a career. Spending hours online avoiding thinking about the future.

Once it was written out it was obvious why people saw me that way.

I realized I couldn’t rely on motivation because I had been waiting for it for years. I needed something that would tell me exactly what to do and stop me from wasting time.

I found Reload through a random comment thread while doomscrolling late one night. Someone described it as a structured reset for people who had let their lives slide.

I downloaded it with zero expectations.

What surprised me was it didn’t hype me up. It didn’t tell me to become a new person. It asked uncomfortable questions and built a plan based on where I actually was.

Week one didn’t try to fix my life. It just tried to get me moving.

Wake up an hour earlier. Walk for ten minutes. Clean one part of my room. Apply to two jobs. That was it.

It also blocked the apps and sites I used to disappear into during the day. That part mattered more than I expected. When the distractions were gone I had no choice but to sit with myself or do the task.

The first two weeks sucked. Not in a dramatic way, just boring and uncomfortable. I kept reaching for my phone out of habit and hitting walls. I felt restless and annoyed and stupid.

But I also felt something I hadn’t felt in years. Slightly in control.

Week three I started noticing small changes. My room didn’t feel like a cave anymore. I was sleeping at normal hours. My energy was better.

Week five I was exercising almost every day. Nothing intense, just consistent. I started cooking instead of eating trash. I lost a little weight without trying.

Week six I had applied to more jobs than I had in the previous two years combined. Most rejected me. One didn’t.

I got an entry level operations role. Nothing flashy. But full time, real hours, real growth. When I told my parents my dad just nodded and said good, like he didn’t want to get his hopes up yet.

I didn’t blame him.

I kept following the plan. Kept the structure. Didn’t let myself disappear again.

By month three my routine felt normal. Wake up early. Work. Exercise. Eat like an adult. Read before bed instead of scrolling myself numb.

People started treating me differently. Not because I told them I changed, but because I showed up differently.

My mom started asking about my day instead of asking if I was okay.

My friends started inviting me out again.

That cousin texted me recently asking if I wanted to grab coffee and catch up. When she saved my number again it was just my name.

That shouldn’t matter. But it did.

I’m not some success story now. I’m not rich. I’m not done.

But I’m no longer the screw up.

And that matters more than I expected.

If this hits close to home, if you feel like people have already decided who you are, understand this. Reputations change when behavior changes, not when intentions do.

You don’t need motivation. You need structure. You need friction between you and your bad habits. You need a plan that starts embarrassingly small and builds.

Shame can destroy you or it can wake you up. For me it finally did.

If you’re tired of being the person everyone quietly feels sorry for, do something today that future you won’t be ashamed of.

One small step. Then another. Then don’t stop.

That’s how you stop being a joke and start becoming a person again.",0,1767095735.0,getdisciplined,5,0.1,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1pzg7ix,https://i.redd.it/18cprjbeybag1.png,I ran the math on Bank Mutual Funds vs. ETFs over 25 years. The difference is literally a Ferrari.,"Hey everyone,

I feel like I see the same post or comment quite often of: *""My bank advisor told me not to switch to Wealthsimple/Questrade because I need their professional management. Is it worth the hassle?""*

I finally got annoyed enough to run the actual compounding numbers to see exactly what that ""professional management"" costs you in real dollars.

We’re wired to think 2% is a small number. If I buy a $5 coffee and pay 2% tax, who cares? But investing works in reverse. Fees compound.

Let’s take a standard 25-year-old Canadian. You invest **$10,000** today + **$500/month** for 30 years. Let's assume the market gives you a standard 7% return.

* **Scenario A (The Big Bank Fund):** You pay a 2.2% MER (Net Return: 4.8%).
   * **Ending Portfolio Value:** **\~$425,000**
   * **Total Lost to Fees:** **\~$217,000**
* **Scenario B (The DIY ETF):** You buy an all-in-one ETF (like XEQT/VGRO) with a 0.2% MER (Net Return: 6.8%).
   * **Ending Portfolio Value:** **\~$618,000**
   * **Total Lost to Fees:** **\~$24,000**

**The Result:** By staying with the bank to save yourself the ""hassle,"" you are lighting **$193,000** on fire. Which I did check, and would be more than enough to buy a 2015 Ferrari California on AutoTrader! 

That isn't pocket change. That is a paid-off condo in Calgary. That is retiring 5 years early. That is a **Ferrari**. You take 100% of the risk, you put up 100% of the capital, and the bank takes \~40% of your lifetime profit just for auto-depositing your money.

**The Fix (Asset Allocation ETFs)**

For 99% of us, the answer isn't ""picking stocks"" (gambling). It’s buying the whole market. In 2025, we have access to ""Asset Allocation"" ETFs. These single ticker symbols hold thousands of companies globally, and they rebalance themselves.

* **Aggressive:** XEQT / VEQT (100% Stocks)
* **Balanced:** XGRO / VGRO (80% Stocks)
* **Conservative:** XBAL / VBAL (60% Stocks)

It takes about 5 minutes a month to buy. The fee is \~0.20%.

**Bottom line:** If you are currently paying over 1.5% in fees, you are funding your bank’s bottom line, not yours.

I got the idea to gather this data while referencing a guide I’ve been using recently (*ETF Investing for Beginners, Canada Edition*), but I wanted to dump the core math here directly because it's honestly shocking.

*(It goes into the specific processes in the book if you need a step-by-step guide to help move things out from the banks, but honestly, if you just grasp the math above, you’ve done the hard part.)*

Don't let the banks scare you. The math is on your side.

Like I had wifi, I had unpacked maybe three boxes. I had one plate, one fork, and Im pretty sure the spoon was actually from a yogurt cup.

Most nights id eat cereal for dinner. Sometimes just peanut butter on a tortilla standing at the counter. Then id scroll tiktok until my eyes burned and fall asleep to those true crime videos where the guy has a weirdly soothing voice. Just so it wasn't so quiet.

Anyway the building has this elevator thats been ""temporarily out of service"" since like 1987. One night it broke again, shocker, and someone from management taped up a sign:

ELEVATOR OUT OF ORDER (AGAIN). SORRY.

I was having one of those evenings where you feel like you need to do something or youll go insane so I grabbed a sticky note and added underneath:

If you need help with groceries or whatever Im in 3B - Alex

Then immediately thought what did you just do, now youre the weirdo who offers to help strangers. You cant even help yourself.

But whatever, I figured no one would actually knock.

Next evening Im eating more cereal (dinner of champions) and theres a knock on my door.

Its this older guy, maybe late 60s, holding two grocery bags and a case of water bottles. He looks exhausted.

""You Alex?""

""Uh yeah?""

""Dieter. Fourth floor."" He shifts the water case. ""Didnt want to bother you but these stairs are not my friend today.""

So we haul his stuff up. He thanks me. Thats it.

But then the next day someone else knocks. Woman with a stroller and a toddler screaming ""UP UP UP"" on repeat.

Then a college guy with a desk chair still in the box.

Over the next week or so that sticky note somehow turned into a whole thing. People started adding their own notes to the elevator door.

Alex is a real one - 2D

Elevator guy coming Thursday maybe - Management

Someone took my DoorDash AGAIN. I know youre reading this - 4A

Free chair in the lobby if anyone wants it

And then one night I get home from work and theres a new note in really neat handwriting:

If you ever need anything, 1C - Marta

I dont know why but I just stood there staring at it.

Like a week later Im taking trash down at like 11pm, barely awake, and Dieters just sitting on the third floor landing. Not doing anything, just sitting.

""Stairs kicking your ass?"" I ask.

""Nah just taking a break."" He looks at me. ""How you doing Alex? Actually doing.""

""Fine.""

He doesnt say anything, just waits.

And I dont know maybe it was because it was late or because he wasnt being weird about it but I told him the truth.

""Honestly its been kind of strange. First time living alone. I thought id like the quiet more.""

He nods. ""Yeah. Quiets loud isnt it.""

Then after a second he adds ""when my wife died I kept the TV on all the time. Even when I was in the other room. Just needed to hear people talking.""

We just sat there for a minute. Then he got up and said goodnight.

After that things kept happening.

Marta left a bag of clementines by my door with a note, You look like you need vitamin C - M

Someone made a new elevator sign that said DAY 9 WITHOUT ELEVATOR: SOCIETY HAS COLLAPSED. SEND HELP.

Dieter started giving me updates every time I saw him. ""Good news they fixed the railing on five. Were really moving up in the world Alex."" His jokes were not always great but he committed to them.

I started recognizing people. The guy in 2D who was always getting food delivered. The mom with the toddler. A couple on the second floor who argued loudly but not in a scary way.

Nobody ever said were friends now or anything, it just sort of happened.

Last week I had a really long day at work and came home late. The hallway was empty, no one around. No notes on the elevator for the first time in a while.

And I got that feeling again. The one from when I first moved in, the its just you feeling.

Then I saw a post it on my door:

Elevators fixed but were still doing coffee Thursday 6:30 in the lobby. Youre coming - Marta

I dont even really like coffee and Im not great at small talk. And I kind of wanted to just go inside and eat cereal and watch youtube.

But Im probably going to go.

I dont know, I guess Im just realizing that everyone in this building was probably doing the same thing I was, pretending they were fine, eating random stuff for dinner, trying to figure out how to be a person.

And maybe that sticky note didnt fix anything but at least now when I hear someone in the hallway I dont feel like Im the only one here.",3,1767095566.0,story,1,1.0,False

What the Research Says About Coffee and Liver Health,"Happy Holidays -- thank you for being patient through the wait!

In this educational video, Dr. Joyce Knieff discusses emerging research on **coffee and liver health**, addressing a topic that frequently comes up in clinical practice. While coffee is often framed as something patients should eliminate for health reasons, recent evidence suggests the relationship is more nuanced.

Dr. Joyce references a **narrative review published in December 2025** that compiled and summarized data on coffee consumption and its clinical effects in several liver-related conditions.



Dr. Joyce explains that:

* Regular coffee consumption has been associated with beneficial outcomes in **viral hepatitis**, **alcoholic liver disease**, and what was formerly called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
* Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has been renamed **metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)**, a term that better reflects its underlying metabolic drivers and is expected to appear more frequently in medical literature going forward.
* Coffee consumption has also been associated with a **lower risk of disease progression** and may be protective in **hepatocellular carcinoma**, according to the reviewed data.



Dr. Joyce highlights that context and dosage matter:

* Chronic overuse of coffee, such as using it as a stimulant to compensate for inadequate sleep or energy depletion, can be counterproductive.
* In contrast, **moderate intake**, generally one to two cups per day and ideally consumed earlier in the day to avoid sleep disruption, may provide meaningful health benefits over time.



She also notes that:

* Coffee is one of the **largest sources of polyphenols** in the standard American diet. Removing coffee without replacing those polyphenols elsewhere may unintentionally reduce antioxidant intake.
* Coffee functions as a **bitter**, supporting bile flow and liver detoxification pathways.
* Many people experience improved **gut motility** with coffee, making it a potentially useful tool within a broader lifestyle and health strategy.



Dr. Joyce emphasizes that coffee does not need to be viewed as inherently harmful. When used intentionally and in moderation, it can be a supportive component of long-term liver and metabolic health. Importantly, current research supports this perspective.



**Discussion prompts:**

* Have you noticed changes in liver-related labs or symptoms with moderate coffee consumption?
* Have you ever removed coffee from your diet and later reintroduced it. If so, did you notice a difference?
* How do you personally distinguish between supportive use of coffee and overreliance on stimulants?
* Do you think coffee is unfairly vilified in wellness spaces compared to other dietary factors?

As always, thoughtful, evidence-informed discussion is encouraged. Clinical perspectives and lived experience are both welcome.

Some of the items they usually make include:
🍪Handmade cookies using ragi, besan, coconut, and bajra

Alcohol-free incense sticks with different natural fragrances

It’s coffee-forward but bright, floral, and cozy all at once.

Coffee + pomegranate + elderflower + rosemary sounds weird on paper, but it works.

**The vibe:** festive dinners, candles on the table, treating ourselves without going full cocktail mode.

# What you’ll need

* 1 over-ice coffee
* 100 ml pomegranate juice
* 15 ml elderflower syrup
* 100 ml filtered water
* Ice cubes
* 1 rosemary sprig
* Pomegranate seeds
* (Optional but fun: a siphon)

# How we made it

1. Add elderflower syrup and ice to a tall tumbler.
2. Brew the over-ice coffee directly into the glass and stir gently.
3. Mix pomegranate juice + water in a siphon to make a light soda.
4. Slowly pour the soda into the glass (the reverse flow looks *chef’s kiss*).
5. Garnish with rosemary and a few pomegranate seeds.

The rosemary aroma hits first, then the coffee, then that sweet-tart pomegranate finish. It feels fancy without being complicated.

Curious if anyone else here has tried coffee + fruit combos like this—or how you’d tweak it.

I adjusted the temperature between 89°C and 96°C, but there was no improvement.

It was always, you, and me,

I thought to be,
a certainty.

Croissants and coffee,
saints in restraints,
early morning kissing and complaints,
for I wanted you,
at your best and worst,
and now,
now,
bubble burst,
memories scatter like my mind,
minding of you.

Bam bam, bam bam,
bamabam, bam bam,
I would bang my head,

In another dream,
you smiled while kissing,
hissing,
a giggle in surprise,
fairy in disguise.

A wild cat,
wild girl,
warm burning heart,
an elegant lady,
but crazy,
crazy loving me,
I adored, you. You I adored.

Grab my hand,
turn and dance,
give me a glance,
and a hug,
it is all I ever wanted,
it is all I ever needed,
you and me,
always and forever,
to be.

Bam bam, bam bam,
bamabam, bam bam,
I would bang my head,
it wouldn't help.

Everything,
everything else,
was just a decor,
you and mee,
was the thing,
to fight for.

Never will I stop fighting for you,
it is not an option to live without,
its not a life, if you don't breathe,
and I can not breathe without you.

Bam bam, bam bam,

Dati itong ginaganap sa ADD Convention Center sa Apalit pero ngayon ay inilipat na sa KDRAC or Kuya Daniel Razon Adventure Camp in Bataan. Ang show ay hino host ng pinaglipatan ng espirito ni Brother Eli Soriano na Most sensible preacher of our time na ngayon ay si Brother Daniel Razon at ng kanyang wife na si Arlene Razon, ang majority shareholder ng KDRAC.  
  
Dito, regular na pinapapunta ang dalawang lokal na kalahok kasama ang kanilang supporters para maging live audience. Sa paligid ng venue makikita ang iba pang businesses nina Daniel at Arlene Razon like coffee shop, gas station, apparel store, hotel accommodations, camping sites, motorcycle rides, basketball court at airsoft games. And in many cases, members are then obliged to order food packs inside the adventure camp, buy uniforms like polo shirt or jacket with MCGI Cares logo and other souvenirs with the KDRAC logo.  
  
Pero dito natin tinitingnan ang malaking tanong. If Daniel Razon is truly the messenger of God according to MCGI, bakit may oras siya sa weekly gameshow pero wala para sa consistent Biblical preaching? Bakit hindi na nagpapatanong sa mga members pero may oras for recreational activities sa KDRAC? At kung sugo siya ng Dios, hindi ba dapat ipalabas worldwide ang SKAP para ipakita ang karunungang inaangkin ni Daniel Razon?

I ended up getting emotional, and with the first tear, a drop came from the sky. Then another. And another. Finally, rain. I always have these feelings about rain, whether it's during a time of transition or not. Zeus has always been present to mark justice, balance, and personal power in situations. Whenever I need clarity, I go outside to talk to the heavens. When it rains, it really affects me because it's the contact of water (feelings and emotions) with air (reason and clarity), bringing a beautiful balance of opposites, helping in personal evolution. I don't know how many times Zeus has been present to congratulate or console me. I felt very welcomed at this event, and I felt I should talk to him because I was determined to empower myself, to act more justly, to stop lowering my head. To know my worth in my environment, and I've felt it since the beginning of this growth, in June, until now, with only one day left until the end of the year. And as a bonus, I called on Preto Velho to thank him for a message he passed on to me. Their interaction was quite funny, Zeus's candle stayed lit until the end, even though it was the shortest one.

Wine, coffee powder, and the keychain I made are for Zeus. The pipe and coffee are for Preto Velho. Golden candle for Zeus. White candle for Preto Velho. Sun and basil incense to bring courage, energy, power, prosperity, and abundance!",3,1767094494.0,Hellenism,2,1.0,False
1pzfv9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/influencermarketing/comments/1pzfv9m/keeping_track_of_tiktok_influencers_turned_out_to/,Keeping Track of Tiktok Influencers Turned Out to Be Harder Than Expected,"We recently found ourselves in need of keeping track of our TikTok influencer marketing efforts (efforts being emails, spreadsheets, reminders to ourselves, and vague mental notes that we were definitely going to follow up later (we did not)). This felt like quite a big moment for us (not literally), mostly because we are usually very organized people (organized meaning “good at B2B things”).

Admittedly, we had not done a huge amount of research into the tools already available out there (research meaning we Googled a bit, clicked around, sighed, and made coffee). The first four tools we looked at were either very expensive (numbers with commas) or did not have pricing listed at all, which always makes us feel slightly nervous (financially and emotionally).

A bit of background (this may help, or it may not): we are historically B2B people. Enterprise-y. Dashboards. Long sales cycles. That sort of thing. Recently, however, we decided to do an app (an actual app, for actual people), which meant dipping our toes into B2C waters. The water was colder than expected (metaphorically).

Because of this, we needed something simple to track influencers. Who we contacted. Who replied. Who said “sounds great!” and then disappeared into the digital fog (not literally). We assumed there must be a lightweight tool for this already. There probably is. We just didn’t find one that felt right (right meaning affordable, clear, and not yelling at us with too many features).

So we built a small internal tool instead. Nothing fancy. Just the basics. Then we looked at it and thought, “Other founders might find this useful” (founders being people like us, slightly tired, mildly optimistic, and trying to keep track of things).

We decided to open source it.



It’s free.

No strings attached (there are genuinely no strings, invisible or otherwise).

You can self-host it.

You can fork it.

You can ignore it entirely if you want (that’s also fine).



We’re sharing it here in case it helps someone else who is:

new to influencer marketing

new to B2C

allergic to surprise pricing

or just likes simple tools that do one thing and stop

1pzfv5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/DopamineDetoxing/comments/1pzfv5w/the_60_day_brain_reset_that_changed_everything/,The 60 day brain reset that changed everything for me,"
Six months ago I couldn’t go 10 minutes without checking my phone. I’m not exaggerating, I timed it once and the longest I lasted was 12 minutes before I felt this compulsive need to look at my screen.

Every moment of downtime was filled with scrolling. Eating breakfast, scrolling Instagram. Waiting for coffee, scrolling TikTok. Walking to my car, scrolling Reddit. Lying in bed at night, scrolling until 2am even though I had to wake up at 7. My entire life existed in these little gaps between screen time.

The worst part was I wasn’t even enjoying it. I’d spend an hour on TikTok and couldn’t remember a single video I watched. I’d scroll Instagram and just feel worse about my life. I’d check Twitter and get anxious about everything. It was like my brain was on autopilot constantly seeking stimulation even though the stimulation made me feel like shit.

I knew it was a problem but I felt completely powerless to stop it. I’d delete apps and reinstall them two hours later. I’d promise myself I’d only check social media twice a day and end up checking 80 times. I’d set screen time limits and just click “ignore limit” without thinking.

So I committed to something extreme: a complete 60 day digital reset. Not just cutting back, actually retraining my brain to function without constant digital dopamine. It was harder than I expected but it completely changed my relationship with technology.

Here’s what worked:

**1. Started With Brutal Honesty About My Usage:** I tracked my actual screen time for three days without trying to change it. Averaged 7 hours and 20 minutes per day on my phone, not counting laptop time. That number shocked me into realizing how severe the problem was. I wasn’t just using my phone a lot, I was literally spending a third of my waking life staring at a screen doing nothing productive.

**2. Built a 60 Day Progressive Plan:** I found this structured program through an app called Reload that gradually weaned me off digital addiction week by week. Week one I reduced screen time to 5 hours. Week two down to 3 hours. By week four I was under 2 hours and that time was intentional, not mindless scrolling. The gradual reduction made it manageable instead of trying to go from 7 hours to zero overnight.

**3. Installed Unbypassable Blocks:** I set up blockers on my phone and laptop that completely prevented access to time wasting apps and sites during most of the day. Not gentle reminders, actual hard blocks I couldn’t get around without factory resetting my devices. When Instagram and TikTok won’t open no matter how many times you tap them, you eventually stop trying. That external enforcement worked when my internal willpower never did.

**4. Filled Every Void With Physical Activity:** Every time I felt the urge to check my phone, I did something physical instead. Pushups, going for a walk, stretching, anything that got me out of my head. The urge to check your phone is often just restless energy looking for an outlet. Redirecting that energy into movement broke the automatic pattern of reaching for my screen.

**5. Found Offline Hobbies That Actually Engaged Me:** I realized I was scrolling because I had nothing better to do. So I picked up guitar, started cooking actual meals, began reading physical books again. Things that required focus and gave me real satisfaction instead of the empty feeling scrolling always left me with. Having engaging alternatives made not using my phone feel like a choice instead of deprivation.

**6. Reconnected With Real People:** I was using social media as a replacement for actual connection. Commenting on posts instead of having conversations. Watching people’s stories instead of being part of their lives. I forced myself to text friends to actually hang out, call my parents instead of just liking their posts, be present with people instead of half there while scrolling. Real connection filled the void fake connection never could.

**7. Embraced Uncomfortable Silence:** The hardest part was learning to be alone with my thoughts again. For years whenever I felt bored or uncomfortable or anxious, I’d immediately grab my phone to avoid those feelings. This time I sat with the discomfort. Let myself be bored. Let my mind wander. It sucked at first but eventually I realized that’s where clarity and real thoughts come from, not from scrolling feeds.

It’s been four months since I started and the difference is night and day. My screen time averages 45 minutes a day now, all intentional usage for communication or navigation. I can sit through an entire meal without touching my phone. I can have a conversation without checking notifications. I can lie in bed without scrolling for an hour.

My focus came back. I can read for an hour straight now without getting restless. I can work on tasks without compulsively checking my phone every few minutes. My attention span recovered from years of constant fragmentation.

I’m calmer. Not being constantly bombarded with information and other people’s curated lives reduced my anxiety significantly. I’m more present with people around me. I notice things I used to miss because my face was always in my screen.

I still use my phone, I’m not anti technology. But I use it as a tool instead of being used by it. I control when I check it instead of it controlling me through notifications and algorithms designed to keep me hooked.

Some days I still slip. I’ll catch myself mindlessly opening Instagram or scrolling for 20 minutes without realizing. But now I notice it and can stop instead of losing hours without awareness. The difference between occasional slip ups and constant compulsive usage is massive.

If you’re trapped in the same digital addiction I was, you can get out. It takes structured reduction, external blocks you can’t bypass, alternative activities that actually fulfill you, and accepting that boredom is okay. But it’s possible to retrain your brain.

Your attention span isn’t permanently destroyed. Your ability to be present isn’t gone forever. You just need to give your brain time to heal from constant overstimulation.

Start today. Track your actual usage, build a reduction plan, install real blocks, find offline activities you enjoy. Take back control of your brain and your time.

You don’t realize how much of your life you’re missing while staring at a screen until you stop staring at the screen.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1767094434.0,DopamineDetoxing,1,1.0,False

New here after a diagnosis of Bipolar 2 in May. The team at the time beleived I was hypomanic so no hospitalization required although I worry I was on the verge of mania as I stopped sleeping and had paranoid thoughts i.e. I rang the police a few times worried gangsters were going to kill my family after I gave £3000 to a company to help me brand my buisness and then worried they were fraudulent. I also a few times beleieved my husband was finanacially controlling me and had made the team treating me believe I was mentally ill and it was all a lie. 

It took 3 months to come down from the high and then I had 3 months of feeling terrible, I have never felt like that before. Sluggish, no motivation, complete apathy, unable to function. 

I am much better now; started Lithium a few months ago. I have been feeling good and back to my normal self however the past few days I have been feeling energised, not able to sleep till 2am (took diazepam in the end which helped), lots of thoughts of things I want to do e.g. urge to get up at night and paint garden fences, researching Hamsters and cages (last episode I impusively bought 6 guinea-pigs), wanting to start a blog. Today I feel ok and back to myself, possibly even a little bit lower like a slight crash. Do you think this could have been hypomania again? I have been drinking more caffiene as we have had coke cans in because of xmas which I usually avoid as well as coffee. Can you get breakthrough symptoms with Lithium? I don't know whether to let my team know or leave it as I feel ok again now?! Navigating this is so new I have never had mental illness really before so this was all new in my late 30's.

**Awards**  
  
There were 14 awards in total ranging from Moment of the Year, to Media, to Posts and Comments to the User of the Year. 

Award 1 - **Rugby Moment of the Year**: Runaway winner for this one. The Cork Con Coffee Controversy ran away with 50% of the vote. What a moment, genuinely iconic. “It looked like there was milk in it so there’s mitigation involved” - u/KeyboardWarrior90210

Award 2 - **Most Hypable Young Player of the Year Award for a Player who is totally unproven but my god are you excited about them Award. Brian Gleeson the commanding winner, well ahead of James McNabney in 2nd place**

Award 3 - **Most Disimproved Player of the Year Award for a Player who was Good but is now Not:** Robbie Henshaw canters away from James Lowe and Bundee Aki to take this ignominious prize

Award 4 - **The Constantly Injured at the Worst Possible Time Award for Players who get Injured at the Worst Possible Time:** Close one here but Tom Ahern leads Big Stu and Jordan Larmour for the prize no one wants 

Award 5 - **Character of the Year Award for the lad you’d buy a pint for and introduce to your sister Award:** Dominated by Connacht stalwarts. Finley takes it with a huge 40% of the vote, pushing Mack into 2nd with 35%

Award 6 - **Signing of the Year Award for the best player that your team has signed and played in this calendar year:** An honourable showing for young Jack Murphy but meath's Jordi Barrett runs away it with one of the largest margins of victory this year. 

Award 7 - **The I Wish he Was on my Team Award for the Player you Most Wish Grew up 4 Fields Over, Beside the House with Black Lab that Chased you on your a bike when you were a kid Award: Dan Sheehan wins this.** Tadhg Beirne has a very decent showing in 2nd place

Award 8 - **The Most Underrated Player of the Year Award:** Paul Boyle wins this by a margin of only 2 votes from Mike Haley

Award 9 - **The, Is He Still Alive Award for Players who haven’t be seen or heard from for yonks Award:** A huge late surge pushed Roman Salanoa past Oisin Dowling for the ghost of the year award

Award 10 - **Irish media Personality of the Year Award :** Incredibly close but thankfully good triumphs over ego and Andrew Trimble wins the Media Personality of The Year Award by a single vote from a man who refused to do Bordeaux's pre season training when he arrived there and insisted on doing Leinster's on his own instead. I have an entirely neutral view on this. 

Award 11 - **Irish Rugby Media Podcast of the Year Award:** A very good showing from all of the podcasts but ultimately it was The Left Wing who came out ahead for this year's prize

Award 12 - **The Matt Williams Award for the worst Person in Irish Rugby Punditry:** Matty was just pipped for his own award by the man who was to be the next Brian O'Driscoll but is looking more like the next Neil Francis, Luke Fitzgerald

Award 13 - **Comment of the Year:** Some absolute works of art in this category but ultimately the winner is “Caelan Doris' shoulder injury is fate preventing a Mayo man from lifting a trophy in Croke Park”, by u/wildgoldfishaway

Award 14 - User of the Year: The big one, a close vote where the lead was held by all 4 nominees at some point but ultimately it was u/OxfordHandbookofMeme who has won the first ever r/irishrugby user of the year award. Well deserved for the huge number of high value contributions they make to the sub. The sub is considerably better for their participation and we all hope they stick around for the long term. Well done and thanks. 

Award 15 - **Comedic Post of the Year:** Last award for this year is [u/Shox2711](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shox2711/) 's Based Connacht post - excellent work

1. Even though I have definitely stayed under 25 grams of carbs (trying to stay under 20 but I keep screwing some things up) the last 3 days, my urine isn't budging the ketone test strips at all. Its not changing the color one bit. Is that unusual?
2. This morning was the first time I've encountered some mild constipation. I assume this will get worse before it gets better. What's the best way to combat this? After not being able to find it without a bunch of crap ingredients included, I've ordered some psyllium husk powder from Amazon so I thought I would try that.
3. Not experiencing much in the way of reduced hunger yet. Is that normal? I gotta say even though I have eaten every time I got hungry, I've lost 5.2 pounds in 3 days. I know this is almost all water but eating as much as I want whenever I get hungry, that's still a bunch of weight and pretty surprising. I thought I wouldn't lose much the first week because my hunger wouldn't have abated much.
4. Just an observation, if you decide not to have artificial sweeteners in your coffee any more, you need a much better tasting coffee. Sweetener definitely covers up the flavor of bad coffee.

Sowing The Void

Chapter 1: Calibrations

The noise was the worst part to him. Too sterile and too functional. The sounds of machines trying to simulate life. It was a constant oppressive presence in the Exodus Silo. Dr. Kaelen Rist sat on the edge of his assigned bunk with its thin mattress doing nothing to cushion the hardness of the frame. He listened to the hum of the air recyclers mixing with the distant echoing footsteps of technicians in the corridor. It was the sound of a world already dead, just pretending to breathe.

He had been here for months training. The past week alone was nothing but physicals, psychological evaluations, and mission briefings. They called it acclimation. He called it a cage. He was an object of immense value to them. He was the last archivist of Earth and they treated him with the same cautious and sterile procedures one would use for handling a volatile isotope. People did not speak to him, they spoke at him. Delivering nothing to him but data and instructions. They prodded him and scanned him ensuring the human component of the Seedship Arbiter was free of defects.

A soft chime announced the arrival of his daily minder. Dr. Aris Lena entered. A man whose face was a placid mask of professional courtesy. Lena was the head of the mission’s psychological division and he carried a datapad and a hypospray of pale blue liquid like they were extensions of his own hands.

“Kaelen,” Lena said, his voice smooth. “Ready for your daily calibration?”

Kael stood, his movements stiff. “I am not a machine to be calibrated, Aris. I am a scientist. My mind is my own.”

“The Somasin is not about ownership. It’s about stability,” Lena said, not missing a beat. He held up the hypospray. “It’s a precaution. The void has a way of… misleading people. This will simply ensure you don’t have to listen.”

“I have spent my life learning to listen to data, not to whispers,” Kael countered. His voice was laced with the condescension he had perfected over years of intellectual superiority. “My cognitive resilience has been tested at the highest levels. My parietal lobe is not going to invent what isn’t there.”

“Perhaps not,” Lena said, his smile unwavering. “But the subconscious is a powerful thing. It sees patterns where there are none. It creates narratives from chaos. This simply tempers that impulse. It is standard protocol for all long haul solo assignments.” He stepped closer, offering the hypospray. “Your arm, please.”

Kael stared at the device. The idea of chemically dulling his own mind was offensive. He was smarter than this. Stronger than this. They were treating him like a baseline human that’s prone to hallucinations and despair. He was not. With a sigh of theatrical resignation he held out his arm. Lena pressed the hypospray against his skin and a cold numbness spread from the point of contact.

“There now,” Lena said, making a note on his data-pad. “A simple safeguard. We want you to arrive at your destination with the same brilliant mind you leave with.”

After Lena left, Kael waited for the prescribed fifteen minute absorption period. He then walked to the small lavatory connected to his quarters. He opened the panel for the chemical reclaimer. A system designed to break down all biological waste. He retched, forcing his body to expel the contents of his stomach. He knew it was a futile gesture since the Somasin was already in his bloodstream. The act itself was a statement. A declaration of his own autonomy. He would not be a passive subject. He would not be a machine they could calibrate.

That evening a summons came. He was to report to Briefing Room Gamma. The room was dark, save for the large monitor on the far wall. He was the only one in attendance. He sat feeling the chair cold against his back and watched as the screen flickered to life before him.

It showed a live feed from an orbital construction array. Hanging in the blackness was the skeletal frame of the Arbiter. It was a beautiful unfinished needle of silver and white. A calm and female voice narrated the scene from an unseen speaker.

“Final component integration commencing now.”

Kael leaned forward. On a separate launch feed he saw it. Coined amongst the technicians as a joke, The Svalbard Seed Vault 2.0 rose into view laminated behind a flashing number sequence counting down. The seed vault, protected with its black and heavily armored cylinder, was about to mark the beginning and an end to the people of Earth. It was the last piece of the puzzle. It sat on its launchpad waiting to be lifted away. This was Kael’s purpose. This was the cargo he was born to protect.

The countdown on the screen hit zero. A pillar of fire and smoke erupted into the toxic orange sky. The vault clawed its way upward. A tiny defiant fist against the dying planet. Kael’s eyes were fixed on the orbital feed. He watched the black cylinder drift silently and gracefully toward the waiting frame of the Arbiter. It was a slow monstrous ballet of steel.

He held his breath as the vault made contact with the ship, securing itself as an appendage to the craft. A final shuddering THUM resonated through the station’s speakers via the comms inside the Arbiter. A live sound to mark a successful ending to its delivery. The magnetic clamps engaged. The ship was nearly whole. A silver arrow with a black heart ready for its journey.

The screen went dark. The monitor returned to its dormant state. Kael sat in the silent dark room, the image of the two pieces becoming one burned into his retina. He felt nothing. No pride, no hope, no fear. It was simply data. A sequence of events he had predicted and now observed. He stood and walked back to his quarters. The hum of the recyclers a little louder and the silence a little deeper. He was ready. He was calibrated. And he was prepared to be utterly, completely alone.

Chapter 2: Goodbye

The final day on Earth was a ceremony of silence. The noise of the Hub was gone replaced by the hushed and reverent tones of a launch crew that knew they were handling history. Kaelen Rist was suited up. The fabric of the EVA suit stiff and unfamiliar, against the many times he wore it during training. This time it was a second skin that felt more like a coffin. He walked through the corridors no longer an object of study but a pilgrim on his final journey.

His transport was a blunt, ugly shuttle. Its design a throwback to an earlier utilitarian era of spaceflight. It was a workhorse not a symbol. The pilot for the quick journey was Sergeant Jax. A man whose face was a roadmap of old scars and whose knuckles were permanently white from gripping controls. Jax smelled of sweat and cheap coffee, two scents Kaelen had already relegated to the archives of history. They represented a messy and chaotic past he was happy to leave behind.

“All strapped in, Doc?” Jax’s voice was a low rumble that vibrated through Kaelen’s helmet.

“Secured,” Kaelen replied, his voice stern and professional.

“Right. Let’s go see your new house.” The shuttle shuddered. The roar of the engines were a physical force pressing Kaelen back into his seat. He watched through the small viewport as Earth, the orangish brown orb of his birth, fell away. It became a swirl of toxic clouds then a marble. Then a disc and finally, a point of light indistinguishable from the stars. He felt nothing. No sadness. No nostalgia. It was a simple transition to the life he was meant to live.

The Arbiter hung in the void ahead of them as a gleaming silver and white needle. Impossibly long and impossibly clean. It was a perfect machine. It was a testament to human ingenuity and it was waiting for him.

“She’s a beauty,” Jax grunted whilst maneuvering the shuttle with a brutal efficiency Kaelen found reassuring. “Built to last long after we’re all dust.”

Jax performed the approach with the precision of a machine. The shuttle’s airlock extended, a metal ring reaching out to the Arbiter. With a soft series of clunks and a final heavy THUD, the magnetic seals engaged. The sound of his future closing in around him. The hiss of pressure equalizing filled the cabin.

Jax turned in his seat to face him. For the first time the pilot’s eyes held something other than professional detachment. It was a look of profound and almost pitying curiosity.

“This is it, then,” Jax said, his voice flat. “You’re the last one, Doc. I’m hoping I’m not the last person you’ll see. The rest of humanity will leave within a year whether they want to or not, those who stay will leave it by death.” He stared a Kael for a second taking in the moment as something sacred to him. “They told me you volunteered for this. Said you were the best.”

“I am,” Kaelen said, his old arrogance returning. “I am uniquely suited for this environment.”

Jax just nodded slowly with a sad smile on his lips. “If you say so. Good luck out there. Don’t go crazy.” The words were casual. A throwaway remark nonetheless but they landed with an unexpected weight.

Before Kaelen could formulate a suitably superior reply, Jax had already turned back to his controls. “Inner lock opening. Your door now.”

Kaelen unstrapped himself and moved from the shuttle’s cockpit into the connecting airlock. The door to the shuttle sealed behind him with a definitive clang. He was alone in the small space. The door to the Arbiter hissed open, revealing the ship’s main corridor. It was exactly as the schematics had shown. Clean, white, and silent.

He did not look back. He stepped through the doorway into his new home. The moment he was clear, the Arbiter’s inner door slid shut, sealing him inside. A moment later he felt a gentle vibration as the shuttle disengaged.

He walked to the command module and looked out the main viewport. Jax’s ship was already a tiny speck growing smaller until it was just another anonymous star in the endless dark.

The last human he would ever see he thought dreadfully. However a wave of pure relief washed over him. Finally, the blessed silence.

———

A month had passed.

The silence was not an absence. It was a presence. It was a canvas and Kaelen was its sole contented artist. His days became a litany of order. He would wake to the synthesized scent of pine. He would run diagnostics on the seed vault, his fingers dancing across the holographic displays. All green. Always green. He would tend to his small hydroponics bay. The simple biological tasks a grounding counterpoint to the sterile physics of the ship. He would exercise, read, and watch the stars. The stars were his only companions. Cold and distant indifferent points of light in an indifferent void. He was not lonely. He was in a state of profound perfect solitude. He had also been right. He was superior to the psychological frailties of lesser men.

Then came the test signal.

It burst through the silence without warning. A sharp clean tone that made him jump. A voice both professional and clear filled the cabin. “Arbiter, this is Wayfarer’s Hope. Channel integrity confirmed. All systems green. Maintaining radio silence until planetary acquisition. Stand by.”

Kaelen felt a surge of pride. The Pioneers. His fellow humans out there among the stars. The rules were set. The path was clear. He was a vital part of a grand design and he was performing his function perfectly. He wasn’t truly alone. He was connected by a thread of silence where he waited for the call that would change everything.

———

Over a year later the silence was torn apart.

It was not a clean tone. It was a shriek of pure digital agony. It was a sound so violent and raw it felt like a physical assault. It was a wave of static and corrupted data that clawed at the speakers. Buried deep within the cacophony was a voice. A mayday cry so distorted it was almost sub vocal. A desperate yet wordless plea for help that the universe swallowed whole.

Then, as quickly as it began, it was gone. The comms panel returned to its steady silent green. Radio silence.

Kaelen’s heart hammered against his ribs. He ran a diagnostic on the comms array, his fingers shaking for the first time since his departure. Everything was green. No system errors. No hardware malfunctions. A freak subspace burst he concluded. A violent unpredictable anomaly. A statistical probability, nothing more.

He took a deep steadying breath, forcing his heart rate down with sheer force of will. He turned from the console his mind already categorizing and dismissing the event, and froze.

Standing in the narrow corridor leading to the galley was a person.

It was an astronaut in an EVA suit, but the suit was ripped open. The synthetic fabric and plating shredded as if by a great invisible beast. The figure stood precariously on one leg. The other simply gone, torn away below the knee. Through the shattered faceplate Kaelen saw a face frozen in a mask of extreme silent terror. One of the eyes was gone leaving a hollow black socket that seemed to drink the light of the cabin.

Kaelen blinked.

It was gone. The corridor was empty. Bathed again in the ship’s normal lighting.

His breath came in ragged gasps. He pressed a trembling hand to his chest feeling the frantic panicked beat of his own heart. A stress induced hallucination he told himself. A predictable psychological response to an auditory trauma. He was not weak. He was not a victim of psychosis. He was a man of science, and he had just been scared.

He walked to his bunk to lie down, forcing his breathing to slow. The fear was a chemical reaction. Nothing more. But as he closed his eyes he could not escape the image of the hollow, black socket, staring at him from the darkness behind his own eyelids. The metronome to his routine had missed a beat before he knew it started.

Chapter 3: Flawed

He could not sleep. Every time he closed his eyes the image was burned onto the back of his retinas. The shredded suit, the twisted limb, the silent scream trapped in the shattered faceplate. His mind, his superior rational mind, was stuck in a loop. Desperately trying to analyze the data, categorize the phenomenon and file it away, it refused to be quantified. It was a wound.

For two cycles he wandered the Arbiter like a ghost. The ship’s pristine corridors felt like a tomb. His arrogance had been a shield and the apparition had stripped him bare.

On the third cycle he went to the medical bay. He stared at his own reflection in the sterile metal cabinet. A pale haunted looking man he did not recognize stared back. He had been wrong. The mind was not a perfect machine. He was not recalibrating, he was hiding.

He input his override code. The dispenser hissed and a single hypospray of pale blue liquid slid into the slot. He took it. Back in his quarters he pressed it against his neck without hesitation. The cold numbness spread. The chemical blanket smothering the embers of his fear. This time when he closed his eyes there was nothing. Only the deep and dreamless void of chemically induced peace. He had solved the problem.

The days that followed settled into a new fragile routine. Every twelve hours he would administer a dose of Somasin. He told himself it was temporary. But the Somasin was a blunt instrument that kept him groggy. He needed to be sharp. So he began to experiment. He found a small white pill, a mild hypnotic, to take when the pressure built. A spray to hold the dam and a pill for the cracks.

One evening months later, he was calibrating the external sensors when he saw it. A flicker on the edge of the main viewport like a distortion in the starlight. He ran diagnostics. All systems nominal. Then it happened again. For a fraction of a second the blackness of space was replaced by a shifting, churning organic texture of sickly greens and bruised purples. It was vast and incomprehensible and it was looking at him.

Then it was gone.

Kaelen stood frozen, his blood turned to ice. The spray and the pills were supposed to stop this. But this was different. This was not his mind playing tricks. This was real.

He stumbled back from the console his mind racing. This was not a hallucination. This was data. An external stimuli. His heart hammered not with fear, but with a sudden electrifying surge of scientific discovery. He was not broken. The universe was.

He ran to the med bay but not for more drugs. He pulled up the pharmacological database for Somasin. He read the side effects, the contraindications, the molecular breakdown. And there it was. A footnote buried in a technical paper on long term neural suppression. ""In a small percentage of subjects, cross interaction with hypersensitive retinal proteins may cause transient perceptual distortions in low light conditions.""

He felt a wave of relief so profound it almost buckled his knees. It wasn't a ghost. It wasn't madness. It was a side effect. A chemical reaction. The Somasin was not fighting the madness. It was causing the new hallucinations.

He looked at the hypospray in his hand. He had been poisoning himself. He had trusted the chemical crutch and it had been the source of his new torment. He, Kaelen Rist, had fallen for the same primitive fear based thinking he had always scorned.

With a cold decisive fury, he ejected the remaining Somasin cartridges from the dispenser. He crushed the small white pills in his fist and let the powder fall to the floor. He was done. He would not be a slave to flawed chemistry.

That night he slept without any chemical aid. He expected the nightmares with the return of the figure in the EVA suit. But they did not come. He slept for ten hours. When he woke he felt clear. He felt clean.

He walked to the comms panel and pulled up his personal encrypted logs. He found the entry he had made after the first apparition, the one filled with his terrified ramblings about the figure in the corridor. He highlighted the entire file. He stared at it for a long moment seeing it as a testament to a moment of weakness.

Then with a single command, he deleted it.

He stood up with a smile of pure contempt on his face. He had not been broken. He had been tested. And he had passed. He had faced the void, not with drugs, but with reason. He had identified the flaw. The flaw in the medicine, the flaw in his own temporary fear. He had purged it. He had overcome the ailment. The metronome was steady now for him to see, the rhythm was true, and his mind was, once again his own. He is ready.

Seed into a Thorne

Chapter 1: The Symphony

The universe had a voice. To the other two thousand souls aboard the VCS Wayfarer’s Hope the void was a silent expanse. To Rori Thorne it was a symphony. She sat in the command chair of the comms deck with her eyes closed listening. She could hear the deep resonant bass of the ship’s graviton drive, the steady percussion of the life support systems, and woven through it all, she could hear the high ethereal melody of the stars. It was a complex ever changing composition, and she was its only audience.

Rori was Chief Communications Officer in the Wayfarer’s Hope’s 212th year since its embarkation. Holding the title for nearly a decade, she was still the youngest in the fleet’s history to hold the post. She had been born on this ship, conceived in the crew quarters and raised in the zero-g nursery. Her childhood was not one of stories and games but of astrophysics tutorials, emergency drills, and learning comms protocols before she could write a full sentence. The Wayfarer’s Hope was not just her home, it was the only world she had ever known and its rhythms were the lullaby of her life.

Her station was her sanctuary. It was a circular room dominated by a holographic display that projected the local sector in a shimmering three dimensional display. Wires of light representing active communication channels crisscrossed the space. It was a complex web she could navigate with an instinctual grace. While other officers struggled to filter out the background radiation of subspace, Rori embraced it. To her it wasn’t static. It was the orchestra’s pit and every celestial body had its own instrument to play.

“Thorne,” Captain Brian Rosko’s voice crackled through her headset crisp and authoritative. “Status on the survey drone’s telemetry feed. We’re losing it.”

Rori’s eyes snapped open. She didn’t need to look at the data stream to know the problem. “The drone is entering the dust cloud of NGC-2264, Captain,” she replied, her fingers already tapping across the console. “The particulate density is scattering the subspace carrier wave. It’s not a loss of signal, it’s a refraction. I’m adjusting the receiver’s frequency harmonic to match the scattering index. Give me ten seconds.”

She closed her eyes again, not in concentration but in communion. She could feel the drone’s faint panicked signal. A single trembling violin string lost in a thunderous crescendo. She hummed a low note, a habit she had developed as a child and began to sculpt the ship’s receivers. Not with algorithms but with feeling. She was tuning an instrument. She found the drone’s frequency a fragile, plaintive note, and gently amplified it bringing it back from the edge of oblivion. The data stream on the main screen stabilized solidifying into a coherent image of the cosmic dust cloud.

“Telemetry restored, Captain,” Rori said, a flutter of pride in her chest. “Full signal strength.”

“Excellent work, Thorne,” Rosko said. “As always.”

The praise was familiar but it no longer brought her the satisfaction it once did. She was a master of her craft. An artist in a world of engineers, but she was was still just a tool. She translated the universe’s music for the bridge to hear but she never got to choose the song. She saw the younger hotshot pilots getting their commands, their first exploratory missions, while she remained tethered to her console. A virtuoso playing in the same concert hall every night. Her ambition was a quiet and gnawing hunger.

That’s when she felt it. A new sound.

It was faint, barely even a whisper beneath the familiar symphony of the void. It was a dissonant chord. Ugly and out of place yet strangely compelling. It didn’t sound like a star or a nebula. It was structured, rhythmic, and complex. It sounded like a machine.

“Captain,” she said, her voice now sharp with alertness. “I’m picking up an unregistered subspace ripple. Bearing 277 mark 9. It’s outside our patrol zone. I’ll broadcast it to channel 12.”

On the main screen, Rosko’s face appeared, his brow furrowed. “Analysis?”

“Unknown,” Rori admitted as her fingers flew trying to isolate the signal. “It’s not a natural phenomenon. The harmonics are too regular. It’s artificial. But it’s not like any comms signature I’ve ever seen. It’s insistent.”

For the next hour she was lost in the signal. She tried every decryption key and every frequency filter in the fleet’s arsenal. The signal resisted all of them. It was like trying to capture smoke in a net. The more she probed it the more it seemed to push back. It was a dark melody against the music of the cosmos. It was a puzzle box with no key, a language with no translation. It was a challenge unlike anything she had ever faced.

As her shift ended a younger officer, Ensign Chen, came to relieve her. He was bright and eager. He was one of the new generations born in the deep dark. He looked at the tangled web of light Rori had been manipulating on the holographic display.

“Trying to solve the mystery noise, Commander?” he asked with a respectful smile.

“Something like that,” Rori said, standing and stretching.

“We’ve all been listening since you found it,” Chen said, his voice lowering. “The old timers say it’s just a ghost in the machine. A feedback loop from one of the first generation deep space probes. They say you can’t decipher it because there’s nothing to decipher. It’s just an echo.”

Rori looked at the younger man who displayed easy certainty on his face. They heard it as noise. An error to be ignored. But she didn’t hear noise. She heard a structure. A complexity that defied explanation. It wasn’t an echo. It was a voice.

“No,” she said softly, her gaze fixed on the blinking light on the console. “It’s not an echo. It’s trying to say something.”

Chapter 2: Propositions

The mystery noise became Rori’s world. Her duties on the comms deck became the intermission between her real work. In her sleeping quarters, the walls were no longer metal bulkheads but holographic canvases displaying cascading waveforms and spectral analyses of the signal. She slept in four hour bursts, jolting awake to scribble equations on a data-pad. Her mind refused to disconnect from the puzzle. The familiar symphony of the void was now a constant background to the signal’s insistent dissonant melody. It was no longer just a sound, it was a challenge.

For a week she hit wall after wall. Every decryption algorithm failed. Every frequency filter resulted in meaningless static. She was trying to force the signal into a language she understood yet it refused. One sleepless night while she stared at the tangled chaotic waveform, she had a breakthrough. She wasn’t looking at a code to be translated. She was looking at an instrument to be tuned. The signal wasn't a message. It was a key.

Her new theory was radical. The signal wasn't an external broadcast to be received but a resonant frequency that required a matching harmonic to unlock. She theorized that her own unique neural pattern, the very thing that made her a Void-Singer, was the missing piece. She didn't need to decode it. She needed to harmonize with it. To do that she had to get closer. Much closer. She had to take a scout ship into the anomaly itself.

Armed with her hypothesis she requested a formal briefing with the command staff. The briefing room was cold and imposing, a long steel table with Captain Brian Rosko at its head. Flanking him were the heads of Science, Security, and Navigation. They were a council of practical risk averse minds.

Rori stood at the opposite head of the table and laid out her theory with a passion that bordered on zealotry. She projected her findings with a voice that was steady and confident. The Science Officer, Dr. Clark, intriguingly listened while stroking his beard. ""The premise is unorthodox, Commander,"" he conceded. ""But the data supporting the harmonic resonance theory is compelling.""

The Head of Security, a grim faced woman named Commander Owens, was less impressed. ""So you're asking us to let you fly an irreplaceable scout ship into a region of space that actively destroys our probes, based on a hunch? A feeling?""

""It's not a feeling, it's a frequency,"" Rori countered, her tone sharp. ""A frequency only I can navigate.""

Captain Rosko held up a hand that silenced them both. He allowed Rori to continue and listened patiently with an unreadable expression. When Rori was finished, he thanked her for her presentation and dismissed her. ""We will mark the area as a navigational hazard and forward your findings to fleet command for further analysis. That is all."" The decision was final. A steel wall.

But Rori was not a woman who accepted walls. She requested a private audience and was granted a few minutes in the captain’s ready room. The small space was dominated by a viewport overlooking the star dusted void.

""This isn't just about science, is it, Rori?"" Rosko said, his voice softer than it was on the bridge.

""No, sir, it's not,"" she said, her frustration boiling over. ""It's about being heard. You tasked me with listening to the void. Now that it's finally speaking a language no one else can understand you want me to put on earmuffs?""

Rosko sighed showing the weight of his command on his face. ""My responsibility is to the safety of this ship and its crew. I have known you since you were a girl running through these corridors, Rori. I will not gamble with your life on a 'symphony'.""

""Then what's the point of any of this?"" she shot back gesturing vaguely toward the stars. ""We sit out here for decades collecting dust. We’re running the same surveys. The last fleets back on Earth sees us as a museum piece. This""—she slapped her data-pad on the desk—""this is a chance for us to matter. To prove we're still explorers and not just caretakers.""

Her words struck a nerve. She saw it in his eyes. He was proud of her but he was also the captain of a failing mission, under pressure from a command that was losing faith.

""Imagine the headlines, Brian,"" she pressed using his first name for the first time in years. ""'Wayfarer’s Hope Solves the Void's Greatest Mystery.' Think of the honor, the support, the morale. It's a calculated risk for an unparalleled reward. One scout ship, one pilot. The best pilot for the job.""

Rosko stared at her for a long time with an expression that showed a war between his paternal concern and his captain's ambition. He saw the brilliant and determined child he had watched grow up and the formidable officer she had become. He was gambling and he knew it.

""Alright,"" he said with a heavy voice. ""You get one shot, Rori. One run. A long range pass only. You get to the edge of this event horizon, collect your data, and you turn back. The moment you think you're losing control of the ship or the signal, you abort. That's a direct order.""

""Yes, sir,"" Rori said with a triumphant fire in her eyes.

She turned and left, her steps filled with a renewed purpose. Rosko remained in the ready room staring out at the stars. He had just gambled with the life of his best officer and he had a terrible feeling he had just dealt her the losing hand.

Chapter 3: The Descent

For two years the scout ship Brisk had been Rori Thorne’s entire universe. It was a tiny yet efficient cell of metal and circuits. Hurtling itself through the endless dark toward a single fixed point with Rori inside it. Her life had been stripped to its barest essentials that included only nutrient cycles, system diagnostics and of the course, the signal. The symphony of the void was now a constant intimate companion that she no longer just heard. She felt it in her bones as a resonant hum that vibrated through the ship's hull and fully into her soul.

Over the long silent journey the signal had changed. It was no longer a dissonant chord to be analyzed. It became a familiar complex melody. She had learned its nuances and its rhythms, even its moods. She hummed with it for hours, her voice a fragile counterpoint to its cosmic power. She believed she was in a silent two way conversation that the anomaly was a sentient entity and she being its first disciple.

As the final weeks of her journey ticked away a new and more radical theory took root. The Brisk itself was the problem. It’s gentle hum of the life support, the thrum of the graviton drive, and the faint electronic chatter of the ship's computers. It was all noise. It was a barrier between her and the pure unfiltered signal. She became convinced that to achieve true harmony, to unlock the final secret, she had to eliminate all intermediaries. She had to be in the vacuum directly exposed with only her suit and her comms relay as a conduit.

She brought the Brisk out of superluminal travel. Before her hanging in the blackness, was nothing. And yet it was everything. The anomaly was an invisible presence, a tear in the fabric of reality that shimmered only at the edge of her perception.

This was it. This was the end of the pilgrimage.

She ran her final diagnostics with movements that were calm and ritualistic. Sealing the command deck by leaving the ship on automatic pilot, she stepped back away from the controls. Then she suited up. This was not a standard EVA, it was a sacrament. She stood in the airlock, her heart a steady drum taking in the moment in long breaths. She then watched the outer door open onto the void. She pushed off. She was a tiny fragile figure of white and gold floating before an unimaginable force.

The moment she left the ship's interference, it happened.

The signal didn't just enter her headset it flooded her entire being. It was a tidal wave of pure raw information. A symphony of such overwhelming beauty and complexity that her mortal mind strained to contain it. It wasn't a sound. It was a feeling, a color, a truth. She felt her consciousness expanding, then dissolving, merging with something ancient and vast. Through her comms her voice was a breathless ecstatic whisper.

""It's inside me... I see... the patterns... it's so beautiful...""

But the beauty quickly turned into a lie. The connection became an invasion. The sheer volume of energy pouring through the comms relay was too much for the technology to handle. Alarms began to scream inside her helmet becoming a discordant counterpoint to the cosmic symphony. The Brisks’ systems fused with her suit's own, became catastrophically overloaded.

On the bridge of the Brisk, lights flashed and died. The console she had left behind sparked and went dark. The ship was not destroyed by an external force. It was torn apart from the inside out by the very energy Rori had welcomed. A massive energy pulse, a feedback loop of ship systems and Rori's own overloaded consciousness, erupted from the scout ship.

In the final microsecond before her awareness was obliterated her training and instinct screamed. Her final act was not of discovery but of pure, primal terror. She triggered the emergency distress beacon on her suit. But the transmitter was already fused with the subspace energy that was consuming her. Her raw agonized scream was a desperate cry of ""MAYDAY! HELP ME!"" And it was imprinted onto the energy pulse itself.

The pulse, a new and unnatural thing, rocketed through subspace. It was no longer a simple broadcast. It was a sonic fossil. A permanent repeating echo of her final moment of discovery and despair. It became a ghost in the machine. It became a broadcast that could not be stopped, searching for a receiver strong enough to hear its call.

Far away the Brisk went dark becoming a dead hulk floating in the void. All that remained of Rori Thorne was her voice locked in an endless loop, hurtling through the cosmos toward a lonely archivist who was desperately waiting for a message of hope.

should i ghost him na lang? but he insists na after boards he'd look for me and we have a big chance getting back together.

Context:
we're both 23F/M. our problem started during his review season kasi LDR kami (which we're not very used to na set-up). he wants me to go to him sa Cebu but I have no money and coming from a strict and conservative family, i assumed na hindi ako papayagan to go there sa kanya. he would always ask me but then he got tired. personally, nakokonsensya ako dahil wala lang man ako sa tabi nya during those hard times given na nagrereview sya.

that problem caused him DAW to ask other girls for coffee because he needs someone to talk to daw since I wasn't able to go whenever he asks and i was thinking he has friends naman to ask. i confronted him about it but it got worse and he'd always say na hindi daw sya mentally stable given the pressure.

then when he went home for Christmas he broke up with me saying na he'll focus muna sa boards but I saw him chatting a girl from his review center which nakita nya lang during preboards nila (hindi pa sila naka interact personal). but even after the break up we still see each other, acts like a couple and he promised me na ako lang naman daw papakasalan nya but his actions are contradicting his words dahil he still chats this girl and if makasama kami he deletes his messenger and fb lite para daw for privacy and hindi ko makita.

my mental health's getting unstable i don't even know what to do na. please help.",1,1767094101.0,adviceph,4,1.0,False

My first night of sleep tracking drained about 18% of the battery, starting from nearly full. That’s reasonable, but the accuracy still feels questionable.

https://preview.redd.it/5guwlym9xbag1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb505709325bdd842a7d26177153b1291cd0967

For instance:

\-The app logged “Time in Bed” as “Time Asleep,” which is simply not accurate.

\-I woke up twice during the night for a few minutes each time, but neither wake-up was detected

\-To be fair, my Apple Watch Ultra 3 also occasionally misses wake-ups, so this isn’t unique to Even.

Personally, I’m okay with the ring being around 90% accurate. I didn’t buy it to replace my Apple Watch; I bought it to make the glasses usable. And for that purpose, it’s already doing a great job.

However, I prefer the ring’s comfort over my Apple Watch Ultra for sleep because the watch is simply too bulky to wear comfortably at night. The R1 is small, light, and unobtrusive.

But the real value lies in the glasses’ control.

Once you rotate the ring so the touch surface aligns with your natural swipe angle (for me, that meant tilting it about 15° toward my thumb), the input becomes incredibly precise:

\-Tap, double-tap, and long press all work flawlessly.

\-I’ve had only three misclicks in 24 hours, including while sleeping.

\-After adjusting the angle, I haven’t missed a single input.

The glasses’ built-in touchpad, on the other hand, doesn’t work well for me. I only use it for silent mode or a hard reset, and thankfully, I haven’t needed either yet.

Without the ring, the glasses would be far less enjoyable. I’d hate having to constantly reach behind my ear to navigate menus.

**Brightness, Outdoor Use & Sunglasses Clip-On**

At full brightness, the displays work well (here in Denmark). I expect they’ll perform fine in sunnier environments.

A few notes:

\-The sunglasses clip-ons actually make the display worse indoors due to glare and reflections.

\-Outside, the glare disappears, and the clip-ons work fine.

\- Auto-brightness is optimized for indoor lighting, so stepping outside often requires a manual adjustment. Saying “Hey Even, brightness up” increases the brightness by 20%, and around 44% is already suitable for outdoor use.

One tip:

Set auto screen-off to “Never.” And use the R1 to dismiss the screen once you don't need it.

This makes the glasses much more usable since you can glance up and down without constantly waking the display.

**Display Quality, Glare, and Edge Blooming**

The center of the display is sharp and crisp, but the edges, especially around the date and weather icons, exhibit noticeable glare or blooming. It’s not a dealbreaker, and in real-use scenarios, I rarely look at the corners, but it’s still something Even should communicate more clearly.

I’m currently in conversation with support to understand whether this is a limitation of refractive displays.

**Conversate AI and Video Summaries**

I tested Conversate using a YouTube video about a coffee brewer. Overall, it’s impressive:

\- It comprehends context well, even when videos deviate from the main topic and return later.

\- It can intelligently reference earlier parts of the video.

\- It provides helpful summaries of terms or concepts.

However, there are areas for improvement:

\- Sometimes, it doesn’t fact-check well enough.

\- I wish I could tap a sentence and expand it.

\- I’d love the ability to scroll the transcript directly on the glasses and select a section to analyze.

**Notifications and App “Unlocking” Behavior**

This part is… peculiar.

When you first set up the glasses:

\- Only a few apps appear in the notification list.

\- Additional apps only appear after they send their first notification.

\- Over 24 hours, I “unlocked” around 12 new apps this way.

It feels like the system has to “learn” each app as it appears. This should be explained in the app, because otherwise, it appears as if the glasses simply don’t support many apps.

A simple description or a grayed-out list of all apps would resolve this confusion.

https://preview.redd.it/4lsq9chgxbag1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=e11d8fa29cdb66766cbb4ca9f7c3d5c7d8770dcb

**Wear Detection and Waking the Glasses**

Wear Detection is a nice feature, but poorly explained.

Here’s how it works:

\- When you put on the glasses, tap the right temple once.

\- You’ll hear a small beep.

\- After that, the glasses unlock, and the R1 works normally.

\- They stay awake until you take them off.

Without Wear Detection, accidental touches could activate the UI, so the feature makes sense. However, it needs better documentation.

**Even the AI (Voice Assistant) needs improvement.**

The voice assistant is functional but inconsistent.

Issues I’ve encountered include:

\- Simple commands like “show me my battery percentage” don’t work.

\- If I say something that sounds like “Even,” it interrupts me mid-sentence.

\- Long answers sometimes close abruptly before I can read them.

\- It occasionally forgets previous context, even after saying it would remember my name or details.

Search and location queries work well, but conversational memory and stability need improvement. If Even’s in-house LLM is too limited, integrating a more robust model could help.

https://preview.redd.it/4qnj4mlixbag1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eabc3e7e63d4980397bc20e611cc711b7b7e197

**Settings & On-Device Controls**

This is one of my biggest frustrations.

There are too many settings that can only be changed through the phone, require using the AI assistant, or can’t be changed at all.

Examples include:

\- Translation language

\- Conversation language

\- Brightness

\- Menu order

\- Notification access

I want to rearrange the dashboard so that the features I use most (Silent Mode, Notifications) are at the top, not buried under Translate.

You can’t change languages from the glasses. The R1 only launches the feature; it doesn’t open settings. If I want to switch from English to Danish, I must open the phone app, change the language, and relaunch.

This adds friction to something that should be quick and seamless.

If the goal is a “minimal phone” lifestyle, then more settings need to be accessible directly from the glasses.

**However**, all features work perfectly even when the phone is locked, unlocked, or the app is minimized.

These are my toughest so far from using the glasses and R1. I’ll likely have more options as time goes on.",12,1767093571.0,EvenRealities,5,1.0,False

‎I don’t know if there is a proper way to begin this, so I’ll just start where the truth is.


‎Thank you.



‎Thank you for being there during a time when I was quietly breaking, even when you yourself were grieving. I don’t think I ever fully acknowledged how much strength it took for you to show up for others while carrying your own loss.


‎‎I remember the late nights in the office — when everything felt heavier after hours. You’d treat me to coffee and a cigarette, not just as a habit, but as a pause. A moment to breathe. A reminder that I wasn’t alone in my thoughts.


‎‎You checked on me constantly, especially when I relapsed or when things felt like they were slipping again. You didn’t hover, you didn’t judge. You were gentle, but never distant. Straightforward, but never harsh. You had a way of telling the truth without making it hurt more than it already did.


‎‎I remember how you supported my running era — how you helped me look for affordable shoes, how you believed in small efforts, small progress. You taught me that moving forward didn’t have to be grand. It just had to be honest.


‎‎Somewhere along the way, you became the sister I never had. The kind who looks out quietly. The kind who reminds you of who you are when you forget.


‎‎Your words stayed with me.


‎‎“Wag mo patayin ang pangarap mo.”
‎At the time, I didn’t fully understand how powerful that was. I just knew it felt like someone was asking me to stay alive — not just physically, but emotionally.


‎‎“You’ll learn something every day, and with every learning, a step forward to move forward.”
‎I carry that with me still. Even now, when I feel lost. Even now, when the path isn’t clear.


‎‎I’m sorry I left without saying goodbye. I wasn’t trying to erase what we shared. I was overwhelmed, pulled in too many directions, and I chose silence because I didn’t know how to hold everything at once. That silence was about my limitations, not your worth.


‎‎Please know this:
‎Your kindness mattered. Your presence mattered. Your words continue to live in me.


‎‎If I am still trying — still standing, still learning, still hoping — it’s partly because you once reminded me that I could.


‎‎Thank you for the care you gave so freely.
‎Thank you for the softness and the honesty.
‎Thank you for being there when you didn’t have to be.


‎‎I will honor you by continuing forward — gently, imperfectly, but sincerely.


‎‎With gratitude I still carry,

I know he’s been struggling with feeling lonely and lost, but I’m starting to feel like I’m failing him. Every day, I try to check in, sending him a quick message just to see how he’s doing, but it’s like he’s avoiding me. I even went as far as inviting him to go out for a drink or grab coffee, something we used to do all the time, but he always cancels last minute or says he's ‘too tired.’

I’ve noticed that when we do talk, he barely opens up. He’ll respond with short answers or just talk about random things to avoid the real stuff. I’ve tried being there for him in ways that used to work, sending him funny memes or even just texting ‘Hey, I’m thinking of you’ but nothing seems to lift his mood. I even tried asking if he wanted to talk about the breakup, but he just shuts down. It feels like I’m doing everything I can, but I don’t know what else to do to make him feel better.

I suggested he talk to a therapist a few weeks ago, but he just brushed it off, saying he wasn’t ready. I get that, but at the same time, I feel guilty because I can’t help him the way I want to. I’m afraid he’s pushing me away because he feels like I can’t understand what he’s going through. I feel like I’m not doing enough, and it’s eating me up inside. I don’t want to push too hard and make him feel worse, but I don’t know how much longer I can watch him isolate himself. I miss the old Jack, the one who would laugh with me about stupid things and talk about his goals.

1pzffz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pzffz8/the_11th_rule_of_the_midnight_highway/,The 11th Rule of the Midnight Highway,"I work as a long-haul trucker. It’s a lonely life, but the pay is good and I like the silence. Last week, I was driving through a desolate stretch of the Nevada desert when I stopped at a gas station that looked like it hadn't been painted since the 70s.

The old man behind the counter didn’t look at me when I paid for my coffee. He just slipped a laminated piece of paper across the counter.

""Rules for the 50-mile stretch ahead,"" he rasped. ""Read 'em. Follow 'em. Especially the last one.""

I laughed, thinking it was some local tourist trap gimmick. I tossed the paper on my dashboard and kept driving. But as the sun dipped below the horizon, the desert changed. The sand looked purple, and the stars seemed to vanish, leaving a sky so black it felt heavy.

I picked up the paper and read:

**1. Keep your high beams on at all times.**

**2. If you see a gas station that looks like this one, do not stop. We are the only one.**

**3. If you hear a child crying on your CB radio, turn the volume up until the crying stops.**

... and so on. They were creepy, but I followed them out of boredom. Then I got to the bottom.

**11. If you see a hitchhiker wearing a yellow raincoat, do not look at his feet. If you look at his feet, do not look at his face. If you look at his face... pray he likes your voice.**

Five miles later, my headlights caught a flash of bright yellow.

A man was standing on the shoulder. It was bone-dry in the desert, not a cloud in the sky, but he was wearing a heavy, slick yellow raincoat. My heart hammered against my ribs. I tried to look away, but curiosity is a curse.

I looked at his feet.

He wasn't wearing shoes. He wasn't even standing on the ground. His ""feet"" were long, pale appendages that looked more like human fingers, hovering an inch above the asphalt.

Rule 11: If you look at his feet, do not look at his face.

I panicked. I jerked my head up to look at the road, but my eyes betrayed me. I caught a glimpse of him in the side mirror. His face wasn't a face. It was just smooth, pale skin stretched over a skull, with a single, vertical slit where a mouth should be.

Suddenly, my passenger door—which I knew was locked—clicked open.

The cab of the truck grew impossibly cold. The smell of rotting seaweed and old copper filled the air. I didn't turn my head. I stared straight at the black asphalt, my knuckles white on the steering wheel.

""Nice... truck..."" a voice whispered. It didn't sound like a human voice. It sounded like someone was rubbing two pieces of sandpaper together to mimic words.

""Thank you,"" I choked out. My voice was trembling.

""I like... your voice..."" the thing said. I could hear the wet sound of that vertical slit opening and closing. ""Can I... have it?""

The engine started to sputter. The lights on the dashboard flickered. I remembered the old man's warning. I started to talk. I talked about everything. I told the thing about my childhood, my ex-wife, what I had for breakfast, the plot of every movie I’ve ever seen.

I talked for forty miles. My throat felt like it was bleeding. My voice grew raspy, then a whisper, then a wheeze.

Whenever I slowed down my talking, the thing would lean closer. I could feel its cold, damp breath on my ear. I could see those long, finger-like feet twitching in my peripheral vision.

""More..."" it hissed. ""Tell me... more...""

Finally, I saw the lights of a truck stop in the distance. The 50-mile stretch was ending. With the last bit of strength in my lungs, I began to sing. I sang a nonsensical lullaby my mother used to tell me.

As the truck crossed the line into the neon glow of the truck stop, the weight in the passenger seat vanished. The door clicked shut. The smell of rot was replaced by the scent of diesel and cheap burgers.

I pulled over and sat in silence for an hour, shaking. When I finally looked in the rearview mirror, there was a wet, yellow smudge on the passenger seat.

And on the window, written in the fog of my own breath, were three words:

**""See you tomorrow.""**

I haven't slept since. Because every time I try to speak now, I don't hear my own voice anymore. I hear the sound of sandpaper rubbing together.

And I think he's still listening.",3,1767092971.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

My (21M) Dad (60sM) dad beat me during my younger years. It stayed as verbal for years, until one night it became more. I had bruises and scratches all over my neck, face and arms after. He never had any repercussions (Thank you local Legal system).  The next morning, I had to give him a hug and fake reconcile to allow me to get my things from his house. I still feel a pit in my stomach thinking about doing that after what happened. That was about 9 years ago, and I haven't spoken to him since. I have a new phone number, and he sends me emails sometimes to my old address acting like a concerned father (he always did the good cop routine between acts of being terrible). I have never replied.

I don't know if my mind is playing tricks on me, but I have been thinking about what I should do before he eventually dies. He isn't healthy, is overweight, has had health complications over the years that I've heard about through mutuals, and is getting up there in age when considering the life expectancy of someone with those factors. If I were to reach out to him to meet, it would be somewhere public like a diner or coffee shop. 

I have been feeling so many complex emotions over this. My own girlfriend had trouble putting herself in my shoes when she reacted to what I'm about to say, so I hope that any readers try to understanding. He had a stroke last year and I saw a video of him public online, and he has lost virtually a whole 50% of his face movement. I smiled/laughed when I saw the video. It was the first time I saw him talk in years. (I know this sounds terrible to some people) I'd be lying if I said it weren't a factor in my curiosity to reach out that I feel less physically threatened by him after knowing he has been impaired like this.

I have been able to understand and forgive nearly every single terrible person I have come across over my life. I believe even those who seem unredeemable can be seen as empathetic if they seek forgiveness or were in understandable tough situations (ex. poverty forcing acts of crime). Not my father. Anything short of complete and waking guilt for his life decisions makes me un-empathetic to anything that happens to him or how things I'd say would hurt him.

I am about to intern in a high-finance job which I intend to return to after graduating, I go to a top 3 university in the country for my degree, and more stereotypical symbols of accomplishments. Those simple facts aren't all that define success or happiness to me, but I know that it would to my shallow and simple loser of a father. He is old, and by most if not all of his internal standards is a failure. (Money, reputation, being perceived as a family man, etc...)

In the very possible scenario he is anywhere similar to the man he was years ago, I'd do the following. I want to crack jokes about how he is divorced, permanently cognitively impaired with high likelihood it gets worse before he dies or causes his death, overweight, likely has no more than 15% of his life left ahead of him, will not have a single child to speak at his funeral, deep in debt, cannot get a single woman to sleep with him unless he empties his wallet, etc... I want to tell him that even his last name is gonna die after I change it later, since he has no other male children or nephews in his family. His power was derived by holding things over other people's heads, so I want to explicitly tell him not to put me in his will, showing him that his belongings and assets he's gathered over his life matter that little. 

If he does show remorse for his decisions, I'd be willing to go down that path and maybe have him around my life at arms length.

I feel like I can't tell this stuff to anyone, and I know that my situation is unique so I just needed to get that off my chest.

TLDR: My old man was the bane of my existence and I am considering reconnecting with him and would point out how terrible his life is using factors HE finds very important.",2,1767092931.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

When he got out, he saw Kiko trying to give them back their gifts. He chuckled. “I don’t think they understand. They think we saved their life.”

“We did save their life, but we don’t need any gifts.” She said, looking back at him, and he smiled. He looked at the aliens, and at close range, he got a better look at them. They were both bigger than they were. The men were probably around 2 meters tall, and the woman was of his height. Their eyes showed they were highly intelligent and exhibited no signs of aggressiveness. He looked down at the gifts, which mostly consisted of fruit and vegetables. He leaned down and picked up one fruit, then bowed.

“Pick one and leave the rest. They won't accept that we won't take something, and we can't explain it to them.”

She looked at him and then sighed, picked up a fruit, bowed her head, and stepped back next to him, leaning into him. He put an arm around her, and they looked at each other and bowed, then stepped back. They stood there, watching them leave, and then they returned inside.

“That was weird. They were scared of us, like terrified.”

“Of course they were. In their mind, I can shoot lightning from my hands, and later they will see us vanish or even fly away. We are gods to them, they can't comprehend our technology. Hopefully, it won't have a big impact. We might just be a story about some benevolent spirits.”

“Benevolent spirits? You destroyed a palace, and we killed an immortal emperor because they took me. No, we would be seen as demons, fuck, here we are good guys, there we are demons. If they meet, there will be war.” She replied as she sat down on the bed and started to get out of the suit.

“Well, they might even know we are the same ones. Besides, if the people viewed the emperor as evil, then we would still be seen as benevolent. The guy had Gyma’s as pets I don’t think he was a nice guy.” He replied as he got ready to tuck in for the night as well.

“I’ll set the alarm for four and just fly us to the next spot.”

“Sounds like an idea. Ship! Keep an eye out for any raiders. Put the ship in sleep mode!” she said and lay down in bed as she yawned. “Damn, I'm tired.”

“I’ll be right there, just got to run a diagnostic and check the link from the ship.” He replied as she muttered something about not being late. When he snuck into bed fifteen minutes later, she was fast asleep. He saw that the small camp was quiet as well, and he lay down and slowly drifted into sleep.

He woke to the alarm and checked the screen. It was only four o’clock, and nobody was awake in the small camp. He got dressed quietly, not to awaken Kiko, and then snuck outside, enjoying the fresh night air, and slowly started the bikes up. He kept the lights off as the container lifted slowly up and then flew towards the next stop.

As quickly as they had arrived, they left. He hoped this would not lead to some new weird religion. He chuckled, thinking about it. They will escape this hellhole, and in about five hundred years into the future, these guys would reach space and start a holy crusade about the red gods who saved them from some raiders. Naw, something as stupid as that will never happen.

After a few hours, he reached the column and circled it a few times.  The column was thirty meters in diameter and allowed him park the container with ease in the space. There was an oasis a kilometer away; he could reprogram the drone to fly over and gather some water.  It looked empty, but he did not want to take any chances.  He set the drones on guard duty and went inside. He would let them check out the area before starting the adjustments. He would need a few things as well, and he needed to go over the blueprints again. It should not be too difficult, he had, after all, made a system to link the two and have the container follow their movement. The problem was that he took the system apart and did some rewiring, he could do it with wireless, but one lightning bolt to close and they would lose control. Better safe than sorry, he could install both systems.

He was pondering about it as he went inside and found Kiko working on the screen. She smiled as she saw him, and he smiled back.

“I didn’t want to wake you. Did you have breakfast?” 

“Yeah, did you?” She got out of bed and grabbed the coffee to give to him. He looked at it and chuckled.

“You don’t need to… And I didn’t. I'll grab one of those food tubes.”

“No, you don’t. I’ll make you a proper one, on a plate!” She said, then looked at the screen showing their location.

“Are we safer here? No wild animals?”

Looks as if. I’m going to start with the wireless connection first, then I’ll do the rewiring, and  so we have two systems in case the first fails.”

“And if we are not safe?” She put a plate with a tube of food in front of him, and he looked at it as she winked. “I’m not a cook, I’m a spoiled princess, remember.”

“Then why did you.. never mind.. well that’s why I’m doing the wireless first. It will give us time to assess the place.” He grabbed the tube, unscrewed it, and sucked down the soup like food. It didn’t taste bad, just didn’t look like the hamburger she had given him. She beamed and went back to work. He looked after her, and she clearly noticed and smiled like the cat who had eaten the canary as she sat down, then looked at him.

“Work now, we can play later.”

He chuckled and started to work. When he had finished, he tested it by lifting the container off the ground. It worked as a charm, and he flew it over the oasis and found it empty. He had it hover over the small pond, scanning for reaction, and saw none, then flew back and parked the container.  

When he looked up, he found Kika looking down at him. “You move to quiet.”

She grinned, leaned down, and kissed his neck. “You're too focused. You would not notice if I took a shower five meters from you.”

“Yes, I would!” he replied, looking at her and noticing she was only wearing a towel.

Sometimes I take coffee after my breakfast to not feel sleepy or sluggish. I feel good for few hours. And then I develop tolerance for coffee in three days and I need decaf for another 5 days to get back to this. and yes im diagnosed with PCOS. im preparing for some competitv exams, unable to feel fresh and fight brain fog.

I read about magnesium l threonine. Many people said it helps them. Also people said that they can't function without that. And this mag l threonine is very costly too. On the other hand, mag glycinate is preferred. Still the genuine ones are very expensive. Please suggest me which magnesium to go for.

i heard some products like tata1mg mag glycinate, wellnutrition slow magnesium, biotrex, swisse, and many other brands. pls suggest some affordable genuine brands too.

1pzf708,https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMOver30/comments/1pzf708/please_i_need_some_help_coming_out_to_my_old/,Please - I need some help coming out to my old history teacher. She is the reason I survive and have freelance work.,"This has been on my mind all December and only now have I gotten the guts to ask. I really need help from other brothers and siblings my own age (I'm 28), because I know the other subs would give black/white answers.

  
Hi everyone! I hope you're all doing well and the festive season wasn't too draining.   


I need help in coming out to my lovely ex-history teacher who is more of a partner-in-getting-kids-to-pass. She ""harasses"" parents and kids  to see me, because she knows I'm very good with children with developmental disorders or those who require additional needs. We have a good working relationship, and I often help her with resources for her potentially autistic grandson, since that was my interest when I studied Speech Therapy (and I'm autistic, lol)

Let's call my teacher Mrs J. Mrs J fostered my love for history from when I first entered her class (2013) She was passionate and decried those who saw history only as factoids. Because of her encouragement and help, I received a trophy for the best history mark in the district (95%) in my final  year of HS. When I told her I had gotten a divorce and was freelance tutoring to support myself and my current partner, she spoke to those parents on my behalf. Now, she doesn't see it as charity work. She's openly admitted to me that ""it gets money in your pocket, and gives me time to worry less about the kids who are close to failing history. Somehow they always listen to you."" 

Before the end of the school year, she told me she was going to spread the word to two other schools (I tutor multiple subjects) because I always do a great job with her and the English teacher's kids. This is...a kindness that made me bawl. (I am good at teaching little ones to read, so she said she'd speak to some primary schools for me). I asked her why she was so kind, and she said ""you need help building a reputation outside of just the school if you want to make a living.""  
  
However, I was closeted and on T for all of this year in front of her. And now that my voice has dropped again in December (yay but scary)...I can't hide it anymore. And I can't handle being called mam. Just no. 

So my questions:  
1) How do I come out to her? (I thought of maybe taking her out for coffee when she's back from visiting her grandkids and discussing plans from there, but what about giving her processing time?)  
2) How do I navigate whether or not she's safe to come out to? (I'll give details below)  
3) If she has an negative reaction, what do I do? What are my plans for work?  
4) How do I ask her to keep the fact that I'm trans between me, her and the teachers who knew me way back when? I don't want parents reacting negatively. 

A short description of Mrs J: She is an incredibly kind but nosy person. She will do what she can for you if you work for it. She's an amazing teacher and coaches kids to write history essays after school, for free, in her free time. Back in 2013 I remember her being a Zionist, but things could have changed. But currently, I know she hates Trump, is pro-vaccination and believes in real studies to help her grandson who might have autism. She is one of the kindest ladies I know, but she can be a little conservative. She accepts most people for who they are, but this is different. I'm scared...and I reading into it too much and she'll be fine with it. 

This is currently my only means of income. I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and cannot manage working in in-person places for a few months to years. I get driven into spirals. Not just that, but the kids and parents have already been asking me about my voice.

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋 Just wanted to drop a little reminder that every small step we take today is building the foundation for an incredible tomorrow. It's not about drastic, overnight transformations, but about those consistent, often unseen, wins.

Think about it:

*   **The power of 5 minutes:** What if you dedicated just five minutes each day to something that truly nourishes your soul? A quick meditation, journaling, reading a few pages, or even just stretching? Those tiny pockets of self-care add up to a massive return on investment for your well-being.
*   **Decluttering your digital space:** Our digital lives can get as messy as our physical ones. Take a few minutes to unsubscribe from emails you don't read, organize your desktop, or clear out old files. A clean digital environment can surprisingly lead to a clearer mind.
*   **Learning something new, however small:** Did you learn one new word today? Or a fun fact? Or figured out a slightly more efficient way to do a mundane task? These micro-learning moments build our knowledge and keep our brains sharp.
*   **Expressing gratitude intentionally:** Before you drift off to sleep, or even as you sip your morning coffee, take a moment to consciously acknowledge something you're grateful for. It shifts your perspective and amplifies the good in your life.

These aren't earth-shattering hacks, but they are the quiet engines of personal growth. They are the seeds of a future you that is calmer, more capable, and deeply appreciative of the journey.

Sometimes, navigating these inner shifts can be tough, and having support makes a huge difference. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need an extra hand in your emotional well-being journey, consider exploring [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme).

PART (1/4)","The hum of cicadas fills the air as a black suv rolls up to a quiet neighborhood street, headlights cutting through the amber glow of the sunset.

Samuel steps out, stretching his back. His wife, Catherine, an elegant but distant woman climbs out the passenger seat. 
The house greeted them with stillness. Samuel dropped the suitcase by the door and exhaled, already feeling the pull of routine returning. A month away had softened the edges of things. Made the world feel distant. Safer.

Catherine stepped inside last.
She closed the door behind them, and stood there with her back to it, eyes scanning the familiar shape of the living room. Nothing had changed. Same couch. Same lamp. Same narrow hallway stretching toward the back of the house.
Her gaze stopped halfway down it.

Samuel noticed because she didn’t move.
“You okay?” he asked, gently.

Catherine had gone still. Her hand tightened around the strap of her bag as she stared at the closed door at the end of the hall, the spare room. The one they never used.

“I thought…” She stopped herself.
 “I forgot how close everything feels when you’re back.”
Samuel followed her line of sight. The spare room. Empty. Always had been.

They’d talked about it once. Years ago. About what it could be someday. The conversation had ended quietly, without argument. Just a mutual understanding that some things didn’t need to be revisited. He learned not to push.

Catherine finally looked away and forced a small smile. “I’m fine.”
He didn’t believe her, but he nodded anyway.

They unpacked in silence. The normal rituals of returning home reasserted themselves, clothes folded, shoes lined by the door, mail stacked neatly on the counter. Samuel watched her from the corner of his eye as she passed the spare room again, her steps slowing without her seeming to notice.
She always touched the handle.

Later in bed, Samuel lay awake listening to the quiet hum of the house. Catherine laid beside him, turned slightly away, one hand resting against her stomach.

“You’re back at work tomorrow,” she said softly.

“Yeah,” he replied. “Raines wants a debrief first thing.”

She nodded. Her breathing hitched, just barely.
“The asylum,” she said.

“Yes.”
A pause.

Samuel hesitated, then spoke carefully. “You know it's a serious case. I can't just place this under the rug..”

“I know.” Her voice was steady. “I just… want to know when it ends.”

He reached out and rested his hand over hers. She didn’t pull away. Samuel had long accepted what the doctors never said out loud. Whatever had passed through Catherine all those years ago, whatever disease she’d survived, it had taken something with it. Permanently.

As sleep finally crept in, Samuel missed the way Catherine’s eyes remained open, fixed on the dark doorway across the hall. Missed the way her fingers curled tighter against her abdomen. In her mind, the room was not empty.
It was a reminder.

And somewhere, far from that quiet house, a trail was beginning to form, one she didn’t yet know she was leaving. 

Samuel’s badge scanned with a dull electronic chirp.
Blue light.
Access granted.

The precinct smelled the same as it always had, burnt coffee, old paper, disinfectant barely masking something older beneath it. A month away hadn’t changed that. If anything, it made the familiarity sharper.

“Vacation suits you!” someone called as he passed.
Samuel lifted a hand in acknowledgment but didn’t slow. His jacket felt heavier than he remembered. Or maybe it was just the return of gravity.

Raines was already waiting. The Supervisor’s office sat slightly apart from the rest of the floor, glass walls frosted just enough to obscure details without offering privacy. Raines stood near the window when Samuel entered, his arms crossed, a broad frame blocking the morning light.

“You’re late,” Raines said without turning.

“By three minutes,” Samuel replied. “I clocked it.”

Raines huffed a quiet laugh and finally faced him. “Still counting, huh?”

“Someone has to.”
They shook hands. Raines’s grip was firm, but not aggressive. 

“How was the trip?” Raines asked. Samuel hesitated, just long enough to register the question as loaded. “Quiet,” he said. “That was the point.”

Raines nodded, studying him. “Good. You needed it.”
He gestured toward the chair. Samuel sat.
For a moment, neither of them spoke.
Then Raines slid a thin folder across the desk.

“Before we get into routine,” he said, “we need to talk about the asylum.”

Samuel didn’t touch the folder.
“I figured,” he said.

Raines leaned back against the desk. “There was an incident while you were gone.”

Samuel frowned. “You don’t usually start with paperwork.”

Raines’s jaw tightened. “We don’t usually start with this.”

Samuel opened the folder.
Missing persons reports.
Three pages at first. Then more. Names. Ages. Dates clustered too closely together to be coincidence.

“These are all recent,” Samuel said.

“Last three weeks,” Raines replied.

Samuel flipped the page.
Photos. 
A man alive but barely, jaw shattered, eyes glassy, fingers missing. Another body under a sheet, the outline wrong, bent where it shouldn’t be.
Ward B.

Samuel closed his eyes briefly.
“It’s him,” he said.
Raines didn’t argue.

“You didn’t call me,” Samuel said flatly.

“You were on leave.”

“You knew,” Samuel shot back. “The moment the first one came in, you knew.”

Raines’s voice dropped. “I was hoping I was wrong.”

Samuel let out a short, humorless laugh. “You don’t get to hope with him.”

He flipped through the rest. Lacerations. Crushing force, and claw marks along the walls. 

“Vents. Always the vents.” he muttered before speaking out. 
“He’s injured. That’s why they’re still alive.”

Raines stiffened. “How can you tell?”

“Because when he’s whole,” Samuel replied, “there aren’t survivors.”

Silence filled the room.
Samuel swallowed. The image came back too easily, red lights pulsing, shadows stretching, the sound in the vents.

“He’s hunting close to home,” Samuel said. 

Raines leaned forward. “Can you stop him?”

Samuel stood.
“I can try. I'll head out there first thing tomorrow morning.” 
Samuel left without another word.

Out in the bullpen, everything looked normal. Phones rang. Officers joked. Paperwork stacked up like it always had.
As Samuel walked past the windows, the lights flickered.
Red.
Then normal again.

Samuel found Barnes and Kline exactly where he expected, a narrow office near Records, coats still on, cups cooling in their hands. The two Brooklyn cops looked up when he said their names, already halfway into defensive politeness.

He didn’t show his badge.
Didn’t need to.
“Elliot Halvorsen.” Samuel said. “Ring a bell?”

Barnes was the first to answer. He leaned back, eyes narrowing, searching for memory.
“…Yeah, I remember.”

Kline’s jaw tightened. He nodded once.
“That was that one kid after that mother's death right?” Kline added.

Samuel didn’t prompt. He let the silence do the work.

“She was murdered.” Barnes corrected, tone flat. “Real ugly. Kid was still in the apartment when we arrived.”

“How old?” he asked.

“Eight. Maybe nine?” Kline said. “Hard to tell. He was small.”

Barnes exhaled through his nose.
“And crying,” he added. “I mean Jesus. Of course he was, his mom had just been-.”

Kline shot him a look, like he hadn’t meant to say it that plainly. “Yeah we get the picture Barnes..”

“What kind of condition was he in?”

Barnes didn’t soften it.
“Rough. Shock. Barely answering questions. Wouldn’t let go of this blanket he had.”

Kline nodded again. “Pink. Threadbare. Looked like it’d been washed a thousand times.”

“You took him to his father. Not a question?”

Barnes shrugged.
“That’s who was on file. Legal guardian. Full custody after the mother. No dispute.”

Barnes rubbed his face.
“We tried to calm him down. Told him that his dad would take care of him.”

“And when you got there?” he asked.

Barnes’ mouth tightened.
“The facility was already expecting him.”

Samuel froze.
“Facility?”

Barnes corrected himself.
“Asylum. Medical ward. Whatever they were calling it back then.”

Kline stared at the floor. Silence stretched between them.
Finally, Samuel asked, “Did you think anything was wrong?”

Barnes looked genuinely confused.
“No. We thought it was just grief. Trauma. Hell, half the kids we picked up back then were worse off.”

Kline frowned.
“But,” he added, “I never forgot his face. He looked at us like… like we were leaving him somewhere he couldn’t come back from.”

Barnes scoffed lightly, trying to shake it off.
“Kids feel that way all the time.”

Kline was about to respond to his response but Samuel raised his hand to cut the conversation short. 
“That'll be all. Thank you both for the information."" With that he left the room. 

Samuel got home just after dusk.
The house was quiet in a way that didn’t feel restful, no television murmuring, no footsteps upstairs, no voice calling out that she was in the shower or on a call.

He set his keys down slower than usual.
“Catherine?”
Nothing.

He checked the kitchen first. Then the living room. Her coat wasn’t on the chair. Her bag wasn’t by the door.
He frowned, not alarmed, just… unsettled.

“She hadn’t said she was going anywhere today..” 
Samuel loosened his tie and sat on the edge of the couch, the conversation with Barnes and Kline replaying in his head.
The crying. The blanket.
The way they’d said ""facility"" like it was nothing.

He didn’t notice the time pass.
When Catherine finally came home, it was fully dark.
She smelled like cold air and old books.
“You okay? I was starting to worry.” he asked casually, watching her slip her shoes off.

She smiled.
“Yeah. Just ran a few errands.”
He nodded, he had always trusted her. 
He didn’t see what she carried into the spare room before locking the door behind her. 

By early noon, Samuel was back on the road leading to the asylum.
The place looked worse than it had weeks ago, blackened windows, cracked concrete, the faded emergency tape fluttering uselessly in the wind. Red lights still pulsed faintly inside, running on backup generators that refused to die.
Ward B smelled like iron and rot.
Blood had been cleaned, but not well.
There were marks on the floor where bodies had been dragged. Claw gouges in the walls, thankfully old ones. Nothing fresh.
No screams.
No movement in the vents.
No scraping above him.

Samuel’s hand never left his holster.
“Where is he,” he muttered.
The answer, for once, was nothing. He walked the full perimeter.
Checking the vents. The stairwells.
The old containment room where the door still bowed outward, metal warped from something hitting it again and again.
Dust lay undisturbed.
For the first time since the creature escaped, there were no signs of activity.
That should have felt like relief.
It didn’t. It felt deliberate.
Like the building had been abandoned on purpose.

Samuel stood in the center of Ward B, staring up at the ceiling.
“If you’re hurt,” he said quietly, unsure why he was speaking at all, “you’d be here.. right?”
Silence answered him.

Back at the station. Raines didn’t look surprised when Samuel told him.
He stood behind his desk, arms crossed, listening as Samuel laid it out, Ward B, the blood traces, the lack of fresh damage, the vents untouched.

“No signs of the creature,” Samuel said. “Not injured. Not dead. Just… gone.”

Raines exhaled slowly through his nose.
“That’s not comforting.”

“No,” Samuel agreed. “It certainly isn't.” 

Raines nodded once, the motion heavy. He turned toward the window overlooking the city, red and blue lights flickering faintly in the distance.
“You’re certain it’s not still using the asylum as a nest?”

“I’m certain,” Samuel said. “If it was there, I’d feel it. I’ve chased it before.. I believe it relocated.” 

Raines was quiet for a moment.
“What do you need?”

Samuel didn’t hesitate.
“I want access to the old files. Everything tied to Halverson. His wife. The initial custody transfer. Medical intake. Ward assignments.”

Raines turned back to him.
“That’s a lot of red tape.”

“Then cut it.”
Their eyes locked.

Raines studied him carefully, as if weighing something far heavier than policy.
“…And the evidence room?”

Samuel’s jaw tightened. “Yes.”

Raines walked back to his desk, picked up a file that hadn’t been there a moment ago, then set it back down towards Samuel.
“You’re reopening ghosts,” he said. “Some of them were buried for a reason.”

Samuel’s voice was steady. “Those ghosts are killing people.”

Raines nodded.
“You’ll have temporary clearance. Logged. Limited scope.”
He tapped the desk once.
“Anything you find, anything, comes to me first.”

Samuel hesitated just long enough to be noticed.
“…Understood.”

Back at home things started to change.
Catherine laughed more.
Hummed while she cooked.
Left doors half open instead of closing them behind her.
She spent hours in the spare room now.
Samuel would pass the hallway and hear movement, light thumps, the scrape of furniture legs, the soft rustle of fabric being unfolded and refolded again. When he asked what she was doing, she only smiled.
“You’ll ruin the surprise.”

She glowed in a way he hadn’t seen before. Samuel noticed the details before he admitted the thought.
The way Catherine pressed a hand to her stomach without realizing it.
The careful way she lifted boxes, refusing help. How she avoided wine without comment.

One evening, as she stood in the doorway of the spare room blocking his view, Samuel felt it settle into place.
“You’re expecting,” he said quietly, smiling at the thought.
Catherine’s smile froze, just for a fraction of a second. Then it softened.

“Something like that.” She kissed his cheek and closed the door behind her.

Samuel didn’t push.
He wanted this to be true. When he finally saw it, days later, the room took his breath away.
Soft light. Muted colors.
Low furniture, too low for an adult.
A small bed pushed against the wall.
Shelves within arm’s reach of the floor.
Blankets folded neatly in stacks, most of them pale.

Catherine brushed past him, adjusting a stuffed animal on the shelf.
“I had to break the furniture in,” she said casually. “Make it feel lived in.”

Catherine had lost a child before him.
He hadn’t known the details, she’d always said it was complicated, painful, something she wasn’t ready to talk about.

She couldn’t get pregnant.
The pieces slid together with awful, perfect logic.
This wasn’t a nursery.
It was grief.
A woman rebuilding something she never got to keep.

He found her in the kitchen the next morning, pouring coffee she didn’t drink.
“Catherine..” he said gently.

She looked up at him with a soft warm expression.
“You don’t have to explain,” he added quickly. “I… I think I understand.”

Her breath caught. He took her hands.
“You lost a child,” he said softly. “And this—this is how you remember him.”

Her eyes filled instantly.
She didn’t correct him. She squeezed his hands instead.
“I just want him to feel safe,” she whispered.
Samuel nodded, heart breaking.
“He was,” he said. “With you.”

That was the final clue indicating that she was recreating a memory. 
Catherine believed she was welcoming her son home, and that night she waited at the front door, sitting in the cold breeze for hours hoping her son would return only to be greeted with passing cars and silence. 

The archive room smelled like dust and old paper.
Rows of gray cabinets stretched further than Samuel remembered, each labeled with dates that blurred together, decades of institutional rot preserved in manila folders.
He started with the basics. 

DR. VINCENT HALVERSON – LEAD PHYSICIAN
Employment records immaculate.
Commendations.
Warnings buried under commendations.

Then Samuel frowned.This wasn’t protocol.
He flipped further.
PERSONAL EFFECTS:
– One pink blanket
– Logged. Not destroyed. Not returned.

Samuel’s fingers stilled.
He checked for an intake signature to find none. No return authorization. No disposal order.
Just… gone.

Samuel exhaled slowly through his nose.
That alone was enough to bother him.
But it wasn’t what made his hands go cold. He widened the search parameters.
Not by name.
By ward assignment.

Ward A.
The results took longer than expected.
Then one entry appeared.
PATIENT: ██████████
AGE: █
WARD: A
STATUS: TRANSFERRED
FILE: PARTIALLY REDACTED
Samuel clicked it open. Most of the file was blacked out. Dates. Diagnoses. Progress notes.
But not the approval.
At the bottom of the page, clean and unmistakable:
AUTHORIZED BY: CAPTAIN M. RAINES

Samuel stared at the signature.
Ward A wasn’t experimental.
Ward A was protected. Controlled.
Off-limits to the things happening below.
He scrolled further. 

There it was.
A single unredacted line.
TRANSFER JUSTIFICATION:
Patient exhibits early-stage symptoms consistent with community outbreak. Requires isolation and monitoring. Experimental exposure is strictly prohibited.

Samuel leaned back in his chair.
Community outbreak.
Disease.
His mind jumped, unbidden, to Raines’ son.
To the rumors that had circulated years ago and vanished just as fast.
He scrolled again.
Another line, barely visible beneath a smear of black ink.

NOTE:
Physician Halverson expresses concern regarding overlap between Ward B activity and patient proximity.

Samuel’s jaw tightened.
Halverson had tried to keep someone out of the experiments. Samuel closed the file and sat there, unmoving.

The blanket was gone. The creature was gone. A child had once been protected by Raines himself.
And Catherine was rebuilding a room for a boy she believed was dead.
Or.
A boy she believed was still small.
Samuel stood slowly. This wasn’t just mere grief.

Raines didn’t look up when Samuel entered his office.
“You’re supposed to be off rotation,” he said, eyes still on the report in front of him.

Samuel shut the door.
“I found the Ward A file.”

That got Raines’ attention.
Slowly, he set the paper down and folded his hands together.
“You weren’t cleared for that.”

“You signed it.” Samuel said. “Redacted patient. Community outbreak. Ward A placement. Experimental exposure prohibited.”

Raines leaned back in his chair.
Silence stretched between them.
“You’re thorough. I always liked that about you.”

Samuel didn’t sit.
“Who was the patient?”

Raines closed his eyes.
Just for a second.
“My son,” he said.
Samuel felt the room tilt.
“Ricky,” Raines continued. “Twelve years old. Smart. Stubborn. Always asking why things worked the way they did.”
He swallowed.
“When the disease started spreading, I saw what it was doing. How fast it moved. How his systems were already failing.”

Samuel’s voice was low. “So you brought him to the asylum.”

“I brought him to the only man I trusted, Halverson.”

He stayed in his chair, hands braced on the edge of his desk.
“Vincent Halverson wasn’t a monster,” he said quietly. “Not before any of this.”

Samuel didn’t interrupt.

“He knew every nurse’s name. Every janitor’s birthday. He stayed late to walk patients back to their rooms when they were afraid to sleep.”
Raines swallowed.
“He was gentle. Especially with the kids.”

Samuel thought of the files. The warnings buried under praise.

“And then MALTIV showed up.” Raines continued. “And nothing behaved the way it was supposed to. It didn’t kill fast.” Raines said. “That was the worst part. It ate from the inside out, muscle, tissue, organs, like the body was turning against itself.”

He dragged a hand down his face.
“Patients screamed because they could feel it happening. And Vincent, he couldn’t accept that he didn’t understand it.”

Samuel’s voice was low. “So he started testing.”

“At first it was controlled.” Raines said quickly. “Blood samples. Cultures. Animal trials. Everything by the book. But desperation doesn’t follow protocol. I didn’t know about Ward B.” Raines admitted. 

“Not at first. I knew things were being hidden, but I thought it was to protect funding. Protect the staff. Protect my son.”
His jaw tightened.
“By the time I realized Vincent was crossing lines, those lines were already ash.”

Backstory: I 23f have been in a happy relationship with 26m for about 4 years now. Me and my best friend 23f have been friends since 6th grade and had reconnected again after highschool about 2 years ago, and started hanging out just about every day. She is in college now and had been dealing with some mental heath issues, she debated dropping out of college but with my support she stayed in school and will be graduating in a month from now.

My partner and I found out that we’re having a baby about 3 months ago. When I saw a positive test I texted this girl the exciting news as I have talked to her about how in love my partner and I are and that I was excited for the next chapter in our life together. Shockingly she did not seem very supportive saying “I just want you guys to be financially stable before you have a child” me trying to brush off the comment said “I think we are my partner has us covered for the most part” (he owns a company that has become very successful and money hasn’t been an issue for me for a long time, as I do have a job and work for my own money as well) she dose know this bc my partner has payed for us to go out to eat together multiple times. She responds “It isn’t my decision, I do think that answer should be more solid though.” Her response again seemed harsh as I had just found out and at this point I only got as far as telling my partner and texting her because I was shocked and was hoping for some support form my “best friend”. I didn’t want to start an argument if I was over reacting to her response so I again tried to brush it off and respond “I don’t ask my partner about the financial because we have separate incomes and arnt married yet but he’s been wanting a kid and ik his company has taken off so he’s making a sufficient income.” She responded “You guys don’t discuss financials but feel prepared to have a baby?” Me \*thinking “this wasn’t planned and is a surprise to my partner and I”\* my response  “I just don’t ask…” she says “You guys are gonna need to have some huge talks. Because having a baby doesn’t only mean having a baby” this is where I started to get a little frustrated and said “I’m well aware what it means, I’m just scared at this point bc I just found out and I haven’t even called a doctor yet.” She then makes a comment about me vaping wish she knew I had been trying to quit and hadn’t vaped in a couple month at this point. So I explain that I had quit and was doing a lot better and she stopped responding. About a week later she texted me something random about my dads therapist and asked how I was doing, I chose to ignore the comments about my dads therapist and said I was doing good but had been really sick with morning sickness. Again she left me on delivered. It’s now been at least 3 months seance I talked to her and I’m now 2 weeks into my second trimester and basically hadn’t heard a word from her seance we spoke months ago. I was on a 2 week vacation when my partner proposed, I posted pictures online and could see who viewed the post. When I noticed my “best friend” saw the post and didn’t like comment or DM me I decided I would just reach out and ask what’s going on and just tell her how I feel otherwise I’d just be feeling angry towards her and not know if it’s valid or not. I respectfully try to explain myself and asked “are you mad at me or something? Because it seems like you haven’t talked to me seance I told you I was pregnant and even then you didn’t seem the most supportive for me. If I saw that my best friend just got engaged and was having a baby I’d be very happy for them and try to be there for them as much as I can but I feel like you’ve been avoiding me, I mean you even left my last message on delivered.” She responds “It’s hard to describe what I feel. It’s like I’m preemptively getting ready to lose you. Once you have a baby and are married, that’s it. Like S (a girl we went to highschool with that I’m still very close with that had a baby) , your priorities will change, and the babe is what’s most important. You’re not going to have time for anything else for a long time. I want to be able to support you, but I am still going through all of my own life events right now, and even thought you are ready and willing to be a mum, I can’t be an aunt. At least not at the moment” I wasn’t expecting this response based  off our previous conversations but still wanted to maintain a honest dialogue and tryed to respond respectfully but still be heard and respected aswell, “Tbh I find that to be pretty selfish. My life is far from over. You make it sound like this is about you. You were supposed to be my best friend and really arnt acting like a friend at all. I have a lot of time and I will always make time for my friends, I’m not a single parent and I have a lot of help from family. Nobody’s asking you to be an aunt but I was expecting you to be my friend and be there for me. But somehow I expected you to drop me once my life started to change because now it can’t be all about you. Just because we both have a lot of things going on dosnt mean our friendship has to end.” She responds “I know that, I agree with all that you said there. It is a selfish decision. What would be ideal for you right now? From me. I want to be supportive, but I don’t know how to. I’m working too still and have my classes, you know in May I’ll be done. I’m also going to be moving 3 hrs out of town in the fall. And no your life isn’t over, but it will never be the same.” This is where I feel like I started to be rude and felt fed up with the conversation. I respond “I honestly don’t want to make time for people who don’t want to make time for me. Seems like your done being a friend so I’m not going to go out of my way to support you either.” She quickly responds “That’s alright. I just feel like you don’t realize how big of a change this is going to be and I worry about that. But, I also know you pull through in everything, so you’ll be just fine.” I respond “I’m well aware. Regardless, how would you know how I’m feeling about any of this? you haven’t  exactly been there for me.” She says “I know that I don’t know, and that I haven’t been involved. I’m assuming everything is going well based on what I have seen online. I don’t know what else to say. This is going to be the biggest and best change you’ll have. For some selfish reason, as you know, I’m not comfortable being a part of this. And that isn’t what a friend does.” At this point in the conversation I didn’t feel like it was being very productive so I was starting to get short, responding “Yeah and that’s really shitty of you.” She says “I’m sorry. That’s all I can say. You have new, more important priorities. I shouldn’t be one of them right now.” “Even though I thought you were my best friend, that is really fucking shitty of you. You’re basically saying you want no part in my life anymore and honestly, I’m fine with that. Just pack your things and leave.” I replied bluntly as my feeling were hurt. She responds again “My habits aren’t healthy for you anymore. We can’t drink coffee, we can’t smoke, we can’t go out. And I acknowledge there is more to a friendship than substances.” I said “We can literally do all of the other things that we used to do. I can drink 200 mg of coffee and I can still go out, but you wouldn’t know any of that because you haven’t been around and I’d honestly  like you to just go at this point. You’ve proved to me of how bad a friend you are.” She then makes more excuses to back her decision “And, how would be I any help to you 3hrs away in the fall? We know what living far away is like” I reply bluntly again “Just like your ‘help’ to our friend that lives across the country that you manage to still talk to every day. I don’t want your help anyways, at this point we’re not friends and that’s obvious to me now.” She says “Even if we are and were, I don’t think I could give you appropriate support at this point.” This is where I say “you’re a bad friend” she responds one last time saying “Yep, I’m the worst” and heart reacts my last text. At this point I was done with the conversation and blocked her.

It’s been 2 weeks since this conversation and Ive been reflecting a lot and feel very conflicted on weather I was in the wrong for being upset with her and calling her a bad friend after she basically told me she didn’t want to be in my life if I was getting married and having a kid. Ultimately what hurts the most is how quickly she made the decision that she would no longer be in my life because of this, almost like our friendship meant nothing to her so she was able to just throw it way just like that once things started to change. I also keep thinking about how much I had done for her, there was a point that I was taking her laundry back to my house to wash it and bring it back the next day so she had clean cloths to wear to school bc she was too depressed to go to the laundry mat, as well as taking her out to eat and out to do things on my partners dime so that she wasn’t cooped up at home dwelling and had a chance to vent/ decompress. But then again after all that is it still too much to ask for my best friend to be a shoulder to vent on during one of the biggest and most exciting changes of my life?

Update: I typed up this post months ago, I have seance had my Healthy baby and have had our first thanksgiving and Christmas as a new family. We are happier than ever and I must say other than having an adorable tiny human to take care of, my life hasn’t really changed that dramatically. And this “friend” hasn’t reached out seance our last conversation. I did unblock her on everything before the baby was born with a sliver of hope that she would reach out.

1pzeycd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayMen/comments/1pzeycd/confused_and_curious/,Confused and curious,"I’m 19.

I recently attended a family wedding where I met this man who was older than me. He was very articulate and had a way with words. He was also an avid reader, like me, and we connected quickly. We ended up spending most of the wedding together, just talking. I met his wife, and he met my parents.

As the wedding moved into the evening dinner and party, we had already had a few beers and glasses of wine. I was enjoying being around him when he suggested we go somewhere quieter. While we were talking, he suddenly leaned in and kissed me. It completely caught me off guard. He said he wanted to taste the lips of a boy who reminded him of himself as a teenager.

Before I could really respond, I felt his hand grab the front of my trousers. I started getting hard. Things escalated very quickly. My trousers were down, and before I properly processed it, he had my dick in his mouth. I told him I wasn’t gay. He said he knew, but that he just wanted to enjoy it and help me relax.

Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever had a better blowjob. He edged me over and over for about 30 minutes. When I finally came, he was eating my balls. No one had ever done that to me before, and it drove me completely crazy.

Afterwards, we cleaned up and went back to the main party. We sat with different people, including his wife. That part gave me a very strange, uncomfortable feeling.

We messaged on WhatsApp over the next few days. Nothing sexual, just normal conversation. What happened was never mentioned. Then he said he was in my part of town and suggested we meet for coffee. He brought me several books as a gift. We talked again, still no mention of what had happened.

When we were leaving, I was walking to my car and he was telling me a story that had me completely hooked. He suggested driving around to keep talking. I said my university apartment was close and suggested we walk there instead. I didn’t really think it through.

Once inside, we sat on the sofa talking. He kissed me again. He told me he had been wondering what I would look like with nothing on. He slowly stripped me down to my white briefs, then pulled me onto his lap with my legs on either side of him, still talking the entire time while undressing me.

I told him again that I wasn’t gay. He said not to think of it that way, just to think of it as being comfortable while listening to a story.

Within minutes, we were on the bed, completely naked. I was rock hard. He kissed and licked my entire body, including my ass. He edged me for hours, backing off every time I got close and sucking my balls to stop me from coming. By the time I finally did come, it was explosive.

He jerked himself off and came on me. I found that part a bit gross. He got up, cleaned himself, and before leaving told me he loved having me naked around him. He went on, very poetically, about how he had always wanted a hot, naked guy in his bed whom he could talk about books with. He asked if I minded the age gap. I just nodded no.

After he left, I messaged him saying clearly that I wasn’t gay. I said I didn’t like having his cum on me, I didn’t understand why he licked my ass, but that I liked being around him, naked or clothed. I repeated that I wasn’t gay.

He replied saying we were just exploring and that I didn’t need to label myself as gay or bi. He said he was married, had never done this before, and that it could remain our secret. I still told him no.

Over Christmas, he gifted me an iPhone and apologised, saying he didn’t want to lose me as a friend. I told him it was too much. He said he had never sucked another dick before, and that the gift reflected the bond we had shared.

The problem is that when I was in the car with him, part of me actually wanted him to get me naked again and go crazy on my dick.

Now I’m confused. Do I want this or do I not want it?

Yesterday, he sent me another gift: a set of five books and two pairs of underwear he thinks would look good on me.

I’m really confused.

I’d love to hear what everyone’s planning to do this upcoming year and share some cool ideas!

Here’s a few of my way too many ideas for next year:
* Fencing the food forest area because deer pressure is just way too high to plant anything outside a tree cage

* growing grapes on the fence line

* integrating annuals into the food forest. This will help increase the species diversity and also allow me to focus on improving more of the soil. So, deep mulching things like potatoes and peppers will also help kill lawn and add organic matter to areas just outside current tree root zones. Lots of alliums around trees for supplemental pest resistance. 

* continue removing invasive buckthorn and using the wood to create biochar

* tapping into local waste streams to get inputs for compost like coffee grounds, old produce. Also for getting cheap or free equipment like buckets from bakeries.

* greatly expanding my own nursery beds / air pruning beds to start growing support shrubs and natives to replace the buckthorn.

* getting or making a bench so I can sit down and admire it all, and taking more time to soak in just how amazing this whole process and mindset really is

There is an audition for the The badass seed play. Spence said the 8 year old in the play killed her classmate to get the penmanship medal. Wow. So could Ali got killed for a similar reason? Han is the one that auditions and wants to be the drunk mom. She says she will ask her mom about Caleb cause A knows.

Mona comes, she auditioned and claims Ezra cried. The girls would like Ezria to go to the party and send them photos but she denies. Why did they even said that?! Like who would do that?! The phones can be hacked and with A… that's like not thought throughout. Jenna comes and says she wants to compose. The play is her favorite and is fascinated by evil. I mean even like she doesn't know about A, she doesn't know that that's weird to say cause she could be a suspect for Ali's murder?!

Spence saw a baby in her dream that I guess it could be Melissa's. She goes down and Ian packs. He tells her he didn't do something to Ali and she was a psycho stalker and they argue. Sure! Everyone will blame the dead cause she isn't here!

Marin house, Ashley wonders why the foods are being used that quickly and Han says they used them with Caleb. She asks her if he could stay in the guest room. She denied and leaves. Caleb comes and says he will buy groceries. I love them.

Aria comes to Ezra's apartment. She took somebody's newspaper. Tell me about being awkward and want to say something. Ezra would prefer to deny beer with Byron. Aria wants Byron and Ezra spend time together so he can like him. Why you want that?! It's too risky. She wants her friends to see how special he is. Why? Do you want them to date him? Ezra wonders why and if they know. He tells her Han and Spence will be in the play. She asks who the stage manager will be cause she wants to spend more time with him. Tell me about risky. Wouldn't A be there?! She says it will be an excuse to have coffee outside of this little apartment. Why would you say that?! He will obviously get offended by that!! Then she says she loves this little apartment. And he agrees on the stage manager. I love the so much but this is kinda abuse of power and it's gonna end badly.

Han asks Caleb to come in bathroom to get her mascara, so she comes in. Caleb wants to clean the shower head to have better pressure. Wouldn't Ashley understand it? Ashley wants to come inside to get her phone, so Hanna gets inside the bathtub. Without asking this time and tries to keep Caleb quiet. I would love to be in her position honestly. And now she checked out his body and liked it. The fact he noticed is awkward. He asks if she wants to share a towel. That's so true like come on!

Spence tells Em she got the role. Em wonders if all of them are involved, she could do props. Did Aria told them? Paige calls Emily, Spencer questions if she still tortures her. Not in that way. Well other stuff you can say brought them closer. They talk about Toby and Em wants to give him the french book cause she wants to talk him again about not turning him in. Good she wants to go that. Ian and Jenna are talking and he gave her a bag. The girls didn't knew they knew each other and find it weird. What the bag has inside?! They think Jenna is A. A told them about Ian. So one of them is unlikely.

To the play there are the liars, Ezra, Mona and others. Ezra tells them the book is about if people are born evil or they learn it. Han sees Caleb outside and they look at each other. Mona caught it and asks if she had a nasty dream. It was very true I assure you. She tells her and from the question of Mona I felt like she would judge her if she would sleep with him but she tries to pressure her once again. Some papers of Ezra fall and Aria goes to help him with them. Mona tells her to go to get her food but she tells her to go get when they will have a break. I mean she is right. She isn't the snack person.

Ian comes in cause he thought it was another club. Aria didn't believed Spence kissed him. Spence said all wanted but Han disagrees and they tell her when Ali got them in a party with fake IDs. They noticed Ian with a girl, Han finds him cute and definitely wanted him. She says she's 26 but the ID made her 21. We guess he didn't knew the liars? Cause like they were there and he is with a girl. All that while he was dating Melissa! He gets the girl upstairs. Their innocent minds think he is escorting her but Ali wanted to make memories. And they are thinking all these as Ezra is talking! I mean please! Now Aria called Erza, “Ezra”. I wanna move to Ireland. You darlings are so obvious.

Em goes to Toby and gives the book. He tells her Jenna turned him in to keep him in the town. Like such a wrong way to do it. He wants to move out. Understandable. She offers to go out and celebrate. He wonders what happened to Maya. I wonder as well! She meant as friends and he agrees.

Byron talks to Ezra, completely different vibe, he said his daughter thinks he's pretty hot stuff. Why would you say that?! And after he read his stories, he gets it. I don't get why they got them to talk to each other and like each other. It's too dangerous! He said it's bold of him to expose himself to his students and he needs that beer. Why? Why before he was jealous cause his ex wife is talking highly of him and now it's like the've been buddies for years or like flirting with him?!

Han learns her lines and Caleb offers to help but she feels awkward and denies and leaves. Well it wouldn't be hard practicing being drunk 😂

Byron says he seems more passionate about his writing instead of the teaching. He said in first episode writing a book didn't go well! So maybe there is that. I get him, it's more stable to teach than writing when you don't know if it's gonna go well. Byron says the same kids you love are gonna move on. Well I know some that talk to their past teachers even if after graduation. Also I believe at least one of his class will stay. Byron says Aria is looking for colleges in California. Ezra frozes. Well you should look for every college, applicate, choose and stuff. Looking doesn't mean going and doesn't mean she will move on past you. He advises him to go to college to have more time for writing.

Spence wants Toby to steal Jenna's phone. To get him to jail for a different crime? He told him about the bag like it was mandatory to know. Like no, he doesn't. Caleb can't unlock every phone, okay?

Em goes to Toby's house and she sees Jenna there that tells her Toby isn't here and went out with Spence. Did he forgot? Jenna tells her it sucks being the second choice.

Oh yeah Toby is at Hastings house cause they need Caleb to crack Jenna's phone. He is concerned about Jenna finding out. I understand he forgot since he is so stressed right now. Spence decided to make breakfast but then to ask him why Ali was so sure he watched them that night. How could he know?! He said he never looked inside anyone's window. It is really cool that Spence said she isn't proud of believing Toby killed Ali. He says the Ali thing never made sense to him. In what way? Everyone wanting to know her? Why would he kill her? Spencer grabs his hand and they look each other.

Aria is taping the floor. Ezra comes inside and she thinks they didn't got she called him Ezra but he's sure and I am as well. She will be more careful now. She asks about Byron meeting and he says about offering him to help him work at Hollis College. And she got annoyed cause she doesn't want him to leave. He should communicate with her about the California college instead of just saying she will eventually leave as well. She looked him kinda weird. She may caught something. Mona comes inside and wants to bring her coffee and she gets frustrated.

Han and Spence give Caleb the phone. He asks if it's from year 2020. No, but I am! He can't turn it on. I told you. He said the person who took it should get in trouble. Are you insane?!

Ezria is tensed. And now she told others to leave and they decided to not talk about schedule but argue. The future may not be linked?! Ezra says she looks for colleges in California and she says she looked one on he's fav city. Aww, that's so cute. He doesn't see himself as hers high school teacher but claims she will. Can you please don't suppose her feelings?!

Outside Han doesn't get her second scene. Spence explains. Em looks at Ian and says they never questioned what happened in the party. At the party Han and Em where together and she tried to persuade Em to go talk to a guy that was looking at her. They heard a scream and the girl had fallen off the stair. Up from the stairs was Ian, Em saw him and I believe they would think he killed her. Would he stay there and look at you all gathering?! I believe he looked at her in a way you deserved that but why would he stay there if he did it?! Spence says they should leave.
Back to now. Spence didn't notices Ian then. Aria comes and they tell her.

They are back at the club thing, Caleb appears outside and Han goes to him. He says the phone is out of his league and knows the phone is Jenna's and questions why they want to break in it. He asks her if she will get over what happened on the morning cause he can get the tattoo removed. She says she doesn't know what's he's talking about and leaves. Nice way to deny that, I'm sure he didn't got it. Now I wonder what's the tattoo.

Ezra asks again the question if people are born bad. Mona had a hard time figuring out who's evil and who's naughty. He asks Spence and she thinks some people are poor evil. Back to the party, police gets the girl's body. The girls are still there. What are you doing still there?! They are waiting for Ali. You can wait for Ali hidden. Behind some tree or a little far. You shouldn't be there!! Police officers are there and question others. Ali came to them, pretty cool and says not to drink and drive. She asks a police officer to drive them to Rosewood cause they drunk a little more. So they get inside, before Ali makes eye contact with Ian.

Back to the present, they stop for today and Spence finds an award of Ian from Hilton Head august 2009 that has some blood. They were upset and think he used it to kill Ali. Maybe A put it there to make you go crazy over it?  And they decided to give it to the police. They think it's the weapon. Han will go home and the others will stay at Em's. Spence thinks they should tell Toby. Why can't you get the results first and then decide?!

Aria went to Ezra's place, she says she's done with the play and he's wrong cause he doesn't know what will happen in the future and they should be happy where they are here now. It's true. He kisses her and honestly good answer.

Han comes home. Caleb comes and says he will leave cause she didn't treated him well. Well I think he shouldn't exaggerate that much like she is just awkward about it and doesn't treat him awful, just distant. It would pass. “And you think you have to throw down too?” Nice. I actually liked that. She asked what if she doesn't want to and he answered it's okay. Then she asked if she wants to. Are we gonna play the game of questions? Nice idea though. You can get every answer you would like. He says it's okay too and she kisses him. That's so cute!!

Next morning the girls at the school are wondering if the other slept. A police officer comes and they think they are here to arrest Ian. The officer goes to them and wonders if it was a group effort. He says they should research there wasn't a golf tournament on that day. Isn't that your job?! The blood is from a rat. How could they know if it was true blood or not?! If they didn't turned it in you would say how could they not to! They go to the precinct to question them.

As soon as they went out A sended them “Rat me out, your blood's next.” I told you. Aria wondered where was Ali at the frat party. Now they think Ali killed her and went there to see Ian and Ali stalked him. Aria thinks Jenna wanted Ian and Ali wanted to stop her and made the fire knowing she was there. The fact that you are believing everything is about Ian… And believing Ali stalked him and wanted Jenna dead to get him?! That's too much. And now they see Ian and are scared.
A gives food to a rat and has rats with the names of the liars. The dead was Spence's. Will she put the blood of others in other stuff?

1pzevo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pzevo2/confused_and_curious/,Confused and curious,"I’m 19.

I recently attended a family wedding where I met this man who was older than me. He was very articulate and had a way with words. He was also an avid reader, like me, and we connected quickly. We ended up spending most of the wedding together, just talking. I met his wife, and he met my parents.

As the wedding moved into the evening dinner and party, we had already had a few beers and glasses of wine. I was enjoying being around him when he suggested we go somewhere quieter. While we were talking, he suddenly leaned in and kissed me. It completely caught me off guard. He said he wanted to taste the lips of a boy who reminded him of himself as a teenager.

Before I could really respond, I felt his hand grab the front of my trousers. I started getting hard. Things escalated very quickly. My trousers were down, and before I properly processed it, he had my dick in his mouth. I told him I wasn’t gay. He said he knew, but that he just wanted to enjoy it and help me relax.

Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever had a better blowjob. He edged me over and over for about 30 minutes. When I finally came, he was eating my balls. No one had ever done that to me before, and it drove me completely crazy.

Afterwards, we cleaned up and went back to the main party. We sat with different people, including his wife. That part gave me a very strange, uncomfortable feeling.

We messaged on WhatsApp over the next few days. Nothing sexual, just normal conversation. What happened was never mentioned. Then he said he was in my part of town and suggested we meet for coffee. He brought me several books as a gift. We talked again, still no mention of what had happened.

When we were leaving, I was walking to my car and he was telling me a story that had me completely hooked. He suggested driving around to keep talking. I said my university apartment was close and suggested we walk there instead. I didn’t really think it through.

Once inside, we sat on the sofa talking. He kissed me again. He told me he had been wondering what I would look like with nothing on. He slowly stripped me down to my white briefs, then pulled me onto his lap with my legs on either side of him, still talking the entire time while undressing me.

I told him again that I wasn’t gay. He said not to think of it that way, just to think of it as being comfortable while listening to a story.

Within minutes, we were on the bed, completely naked. I was rock hard. He kissed and licked my entire body, including my ass. He edged me for hours, backing off every time I got close and sucking my balls to stop me from coming. By the time I finally did come, it was explosive.

He jerked himself off and came on me. I found that part a bit gross. He got up, cleaned himself, and before leaving told me he loved having me naked around him. He went on, very poetically, about how he had always wanted a hot, naked guy in his bed whom he could talk about books with. He asked if I minded the age gap. I just nodded no.

After he left, I messaged him saying clearly that I wasn’t gay. I said I didn’t like having his cum on me, I didn’t understand why he licked my ass, but that I liked being around him, naked or clothed. I repeated that I wasn’t gay.

He replied saying we were just exploring and that I didn’t need to label myself as gay or bi. He said he was married, had never done this before, and that it could remain our secret. I still told him no.

Over Christmas, he gifted me an iPhone and apologised, saying he didn’t want to lose me as a friend. I told him it was too much. He said he had never sucked another dick before, and that the gift reflected the bond we had shared.

The problem is that when I was in the car with him, part of me actually wanted him to get me naked again and go crazy on my dick.

Now I’m confused. Do I want this or do I not want it?

Yesterday, he sent me another gift: a set of five books and two pairs of underwear he thinks would look good on me.

I’m really confused.

1pzet89,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUngLgGRJpo,Caffeine is Destroying You,"Look at this bird.

Any substance that gives you a lift follows the same journey as the bird in the video. You start out at a healthy balance. But before you know it. You are trapped in an addictive cycle.

>*DISCLAIMER: YOU MAY NOT FEEL ANY NEGATIVES OF CAFFEINE UNTIL YEARS OF USE!!*

Or.. you may not associate the negatives that are currently happening with caffeine. This is because there is a disconnect with the immediate response to caffeine and the negatives it brings.

Here’s how it goes:

1. You take caffeine through your medium of choice. (Some even go for the suppository… Coffee ENEMAS anyone?)
2. You think, “Caffeine is great”. Look at all your new “energy, adrenaline rush, tomato!”.
3. You wake up the next morning. Dreary and weary. Can’t get out of bed. Let’s get some of that caffeine to make you feel better.

And the cycle repeats. You associate your dreary wearies with getting old. Your lack of sleep is because you just suck at sleeping. Your fits of irritability are just your personality.

Your joint pain is your poor posture, not the fact that you no longer have the energy to maintain a good posture, because caffeine is sucking the life out of you.

Take a look at this advertisement from 1924 mentioned in Eugene M. Schwartz’s famous book “Breakthrough Advertising”:

*""WHY MEN CRACK.. .*

*An authority of international standing recently wrote;“*

*You have overeaten and plugged your organs with moderate stimulants, the worst of which are not only alcohol and tobacco, but caffeine and sugar . . . “*

*You know them. Strong men. Vigorous men, robust men — men who have never had a sick day in their lives.*

*They drive. They drive themselves to the limit. They lash themselves over the limit with stimulants. They crack. Often, they crash.*

*You have seen them afterwards. Pitiful shells. The zest gone, the fire gone. Burnt-out furnaces of energy.*

*“He was such a healthy-looking man “*

*He was. His health was his undoing. His constitution absorbed punishment. Otherwise he might have been warned in time.*

*“For every action there is an equal and contrary reaction.” You learned the law in physics. It applies to bodies.*

*For every ounce of energy gained by stimulation, by whipping the nerves to action, an ounce of reserve strength is drained . . .*

*But repeated withdrawals exhaust any reserve.*

*Physical bankruptcy. Then the crash . . .*

*It’s time to get back to normal, to close the drafts, to bank some of the fires…*

*Avoid stimulants. What is good for the boy is good for the man . . .*

*Borrowed Energy Must Be Repaid!*

*Two million American families avoid caffeine by drinking Postum.*

*And two million American families are better off for it. . .""*

People knew this was a problem 100 years ago. Yet, we are all still addicted.

# Caffeine is the #1 ignored factor when it comes to health.

Here is the “advice” we see over and over again in regards to taking control of your physical health:

* Cut carbs.
* Cut out blue light.
* Don’t eat past 6.
* Don’t eat uncooked spinach.
* Eat only meat.
* Stop eating unsoaked almonds.
* Take this supplement.

80% of Americans consume some form of caffeine daily. I’ve seen mothers give their toddlers Mountain dew! Almonds are the problem? What world are we living in?

We are so obsessed with minor details that we miss the obvious. Seriously, anyone who is recommending putting butter in your coffee for optimal health has no clue what optimal health is.

People are clueless about caffeine. Why?

Because it’s “Normal”.

It’s a problem that is hard to see before it’s too late.

“But caffeine is not a problem for me.”

Any amount of stimulants in your body is a problem. It’s effecting you **today.** If you want to feel breadth of emotions again, have unlimited energy throughout the day, have healthy joints, be able to recover fully from exercise, have the most creative thoughts you can possibly have…

You need to quit caffeine. Plain and simple. You are not living the life you are fully capable of.

# Studies showing caffeine is “Healthy”.

Really think about it. Would you believe studies about cocaine funded by cocaine dealers or done my cocaine addicts that think cocaine gives them a positive lift?

There is a billion dollar industry that thrives off of you believing this nonsense. And the mildness of the drug and normalization make many people never second guess it.

The science is not as bleeding edge as we think. Especially when it comes to nutrition. Caffeine is not a vitamin. We need to start relying a little bit more on human intuition then studies funded by big caffeine and drug addicts.

# Is caffeine stopping us from living the lives we truly want?

Here’s the #1 post on Reddit regarding caffeine:

*""It’s Not Withdrawal. Your Career Just Sucks*

*I’m a software developer, about a year and a half caffeine-free. Immediately after quitting, my productivity at work plummeted. It hasn’t returned to pre-caffeine levels since.*

*I have realized that this is not due to withdrawal, but rather because I cannot, as a human being, sit in front of a screen all day, toiling away at meaningless work for a soulless corporation. Caffeine played a pivotal role in hiding this reality. With caffeine, I can slog through all manner of tedium and even have fun. Without it, I feel a strong attraction to a “stop and smell the roses” mode of living. I go on long walks, look at trees, write poetry, and I don’t get jack shit done at work.*

*I can breathe. My sleep is perfect. My digestion is perfect. My livelihood, however, is in jeopardy. I just wanted to put this out there, in case anyone has quit caffeine but is struggling with productivity or lack of motivation: It’s not withdrawal. You’re a spiritual creature in a cold, mechanical system, and now there’s no hiding.""*

There is something deeper going on here. Is caffeine used as a form of control? I mean, the Nazi’s gave prisoners soup, bread, and coffee for a reason right?

Caffeine is a worker bee drug. It makes you a slave and complacent. It numbs your prefrontal cortex just like any other drug.

This screws with your ability to delay gratification and makes you seek out more short term rewards to numb the pain.

I go over the pain-pleasure balance in my [Dopamine Nation](https://www.davidwrites.xyz/notes/dopaminenation/) summary. So I won’t re-hash it here.

But the pain-pleasure balance is important to understand. Once you do. You will realize that putting anything in your body that is not food or water is making you miserable.

# Caffeine is a gateway drug.

Imagine this..

You are anxious, on edge, irritable, depressed, have trouble sleeping. You think this is just you. You reach for alcohol or weed or Kratom or whatever to take the edge off. You were only in that state because of caffeine.

This scenario may not have happened to you yet. But I guarantee it has happened to millions of people who have turned towards drugs to numb the pain.

Caffeine kills people, tips people with deadly heart disease over the edge, plays a factor in road rage car accidents, causes vitamin and mineral deficiencies, cardiac arrhythmia, perpetuates drug addiction, and much more.

It’s poison.

Hey,

Two more days before this year ends. Virtual hugs to those who are still alive and kicking. 🤗

Let’s have a time-out first, sip some coffee ☕️ and have some honest reflective self-assessment 📝. Here we come 2026! 🤔

About me: 35 yo, 5'3"", nerdy and confident enough to hold any variety of topics (from philosophy, psychology, even if we reach multiverse topics). But I also very much appreciate silence (if you are like me who can be contented by just observing people and things around even without talking to anyone). I live in QC but works in BGC. IT by profession, decent and with a sense of humor.

About you:

• Hoping for someone who has the same chill and light vibes (no negative vibes) 👊🏻

• No height preference

• ⁠no age requirement (I love to talk to varieties of people)

• ⁠decent

• Confident in herself 

• ⁠great smile and great eyes (just a bonus) 🤩

• ⁠working professional (but dont worry the coffee date is on me)

• don't be problematic, we can rant about some stuffs just to let it off our chests

I have sets of interesting topics and questions to ponder on, so no need to prepare. Just be yourself. We know, maybe this is the plot twist we've been waiting for.

I also have 360 view of QC if that’s what you are looking for.
