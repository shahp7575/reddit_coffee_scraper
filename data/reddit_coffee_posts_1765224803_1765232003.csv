1phq0jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/quitaddictionfast/comments/1phq0jw/my_latest_discovery_on_how_people_quit_addiction/,My latest discovery on how people quit addiction fast and once for all,"For years in my work covering addiction medicine, I’ve reported on the grim statistics. The relapse rates hovering between 40–60% or more. The heartbreaking cycle of detox, promise, and return to the beginning. The families live in a state of suspended animation, hollowed out by a fear so constant it becomes a background hum. Their phones are no longer tools for connection, but objects of dread. Every late-night ring, every unknown number flashing on the screen, carries the potential to shatter their world into a final, irreversible configuration: *the call*. The one that confirms their deepest terror — that the struggle is over, not with recovery, but with a body found, an overdose, an end. They become experts in grief they haven’t yet officially earned, mourning a person who is still, technically, alive.

For the addicted person, the path is a different kind of prison. It is a closed loop of shame, compulsion, and fleeting relief. They are not choosing a “lifestyle”; they are obeying a biological imperative that has hijacked their prefrontal cortex — the very seat of choice and consequence. The narrative of their life becomes one of management, not living. Their daily calculus isn’t about joy or ambition, but survival: managing withdrawal, managing the next score, managing the lies to keep the system functioning, managing the crushing guilt that follows each use.

They chase the substance not for euphoria, but for the mere absence of sickness — to feel “normal” for an hour. Their path is one of lifelong struggle against an internal enemy that wears their own face. They witness the devastation in their parents’ eyes, the distrust in their partner’s touch, the confusion in their children’s questions, and the self-loathing this generates only fuels the need to escape. It is a terrifying feedback loop: use to numb the pain of the damage caused by using. Liberation feels like a fairy tale told to other people. Hope becomes a dangerous emotion; to feel it is to set oneself up for a fall when the compulsion, once again, proves stronger than willpower.

So, when whispers of a clinic in The Bahamas achieving something radical — a sub-15% relapse rate with a single procedure — started circulating among my sources, my journalistic skepticism flared. *A near-miraculous solution in a tropical locale?* It sounded like the setup for a too-good-to-be-true medical tourism story. But the whispers were persistent, and they were attached to a serious, evidence-backed name: the [naltrexone implant.](https://debinge.com/addiction-recovery-care-with-lowest-percentage-of-relapse/)

I had to see it for myself. I booked a flight to Nassau, my notebook ready for scrutiny, my heart braced for potential disillusionment. I was about to have my professional understanding of recovery shattered, not by data on a page, but by the light returning to people’s eyes.

Day One: The Arrival and The First Glimmer

The DeBinge Clinic wasn’t a sprawling hospital; it was a focused, clinical environment humming with a quiet purpose — The Private, Personalised Concierge. The first thing that struck me wasn’t the technology, but the people. First I met Sarah L., a woman in her early 40s with the poised calm of someone who had just survived a storm. She was 72 hours post-implant.

“I flew here terrified,” she told me, her hands steady as she sipped something. “Terrified of withdrawal, terrified of failing *again*. The first day, they gave me medication to ease any discomfort. I braced for hell… and it never came. I just… woke up. Not clean, but *clear*. The constant screaming need in my brain was just… gone. It was a space I hadn’t felt in a decade or more.”

Her words hung in the air. This directly contradicted the central dogma of early recovery: that you must pay a price of suffering. Here, the biological craving was being surgically bypassed.

Day Two: The Families

This is where the story shifted from clinical to profoundly human. I watched some families arrive. You could see it in their postures — the clenched jaws, the eyes shadowed with grief and betrayal, the hope they dared not feel. They were braced for more manipulation, more broken promises. Then, I saw them 48 hours later, after the implant procedure. They were in the courtyard, having coffee with their son, their wife, their sister. The tension was gone. They were talking — not about past failures, but about practicalities: flights home, new routines, the mundane, beautiful future. It wasn’t just in the visible smiles or the lighter steps. It was a tangible shift in the very atmosphere, a collective exhale held for years. In the quiet lounge on the second day, it manifested as a low hum of conversation — not the frantic, transactional whispers of active addiction, but the tentative, rediscovered language of ordinary life. People were talking about books, about the beach, about what they might have for lunch. The topics were beautifully, profoundly mundane.

The most powerful feedback, however, was silent. It was in the eyes. The day before, eyes had been downcast, shifty, clouded with fear of withdrawal. Just in few days everything was shifting. You could see the startling return of a person to the driver’s seat. The haunting vacancy was replaced by a fragile, but growing, presence.

You could hear it in the voices, too — less gravelly, less defensive. A man named Thomas, who had spoken in monosyllables upon arrival, was now laughing softly at something on his phone. When I caught his eye, he simply said, with a calm that seemed to astonish even him, “The noise… it’s just gone. I can hear myself think for the first time in a decade. It’s quiet. It’s so quiet in here,” he said, tapping his temple.

This uplift wasn’t euphoria. It wasn’t a high. It was the profound and grounding relief of a siege being lifted. It was the sound of a mind, once a prison of compulsive thought, finally falling silent. It was the first, precious sensation of peace — and in that peace, the undeniable, visceral feedback that something fundamental had changed. The war was not over, but the constant bombardment had stopped. For the first time in a very long time, there was a horizon to look toward, not just a crisis to survive.

A father named Mark, his arm around his son who had just received the implant, said to me, tears finally breaking through, “I came here to save his life from an overdose. I didn’t realize I was also getting *him* back. The person he was before all this. I’m not taking home a time bomb. I’m taking home my boy.”

The transformation wasn’t just in the patient. It was a healing that rippled out, mending the fractures in the entire family unit. This was recovery on fast-forward.

Day Three: Meeting the Architect, Dr. George O’Neill

The quiet force behind this method is Dr. George O’Neill, who flew in from Western Australia. With the weathered patience of a man who has fought in the trenches, he explained his decades-long mission. He saw the potential in naltrexone early but recognized the fatal flaw: “You cannot ask a brain hijacked by addiction to be responsible for its own rescue pill every day. The disease is the non-compliance.”

In Perth, he had front-row seats to the methamphetamine pandemic. “We were losing a generation,” he said, his voice low with conviction. “We had the blocker, naltrexone. But we needed a delivery system the addiction couldn’t cheat. The implant isn’t just medicine; it’s a 6-month ceasefire. It gives time for the brain to heal, for therapy to stick, for a life to be rebuilt without the daily war.”

He spoke not like a salesman for a miracle, but like a weary general who had finally found a weapon that worked. “It’s about removing the chemical temptation entirely. No white-knuckling. Just peace. And from peace, you can build.”

Day Four & Five: The Chorus of New Lives

The stories poured in, each a testament to the “ceasefire” Dr. O’Neill described.

* James R., a former fentanyl user: “I’ve done 12 detoxes. This is the first time I’m not counting minutes until I can use. The silence in my head is everything.”
* Elena M., who battled alcohol dependence: “The implant didn’t make me sober. It gave me the choice to *become* sober. For the first time, the choice wasn’t painful.”
* David K., there with his sister: “She’s been through hell. To see her smile, a real smile without the guilt behind it… that’s the real medicine for us.”

My skepticism, brick by brick, was being dismantled. This wasn’t magic. It was medical technology applied with profound psychological insight. The [Naltrexone Implant Clinic](https://debinge.com/) didn’t do the hard work of recovery — that was still up to the individual — but it *did* remove the single greatest obstacle to starting it: the unbearable, biological scream for the drug.

Leaving: Not a Conclusion, But a Beginning

I left Nassau not with a story of a miraculous cure, but with something better: a story of a profoundly effective tool. DeBinge Clinic isn’t selling a fantasy. It’s offering what may be the most powerful first step in addiction medicine — a guaranteed period of biological stability.

For families, it offers the one thing they had lost: certainty. The certainty that their loved one won’t overdose tomorrow from a relapse. That is a gift beyond measure.

The public is right to turn its attention to the [naltrexone implant](https://debinge.com/naltrexone-implant-treatment-a-game-changing-option-for-long-term-recovery/). It represents a fundamental shift — from merely managing a chronic, relapsing disease to actively disarming it, creating the necessary conditions for lasting recovery to take root.

As my plane took off, I thought of Sarah, Mark, James, and all the others. I wasn’t just carrying notes. I was carrying a new benchmark for hope. In the fight against addiction, we’ve been asking people to climb a mountain while carrying a boulder. This procedure simply removes the boulder. The mountain is still there, but now, for the first time, they can actually start to climb.

He would tell me I’m the love of his life, that he wants to marry me or that he cannot live without me and a few hours later he’d look at me like he’d rather have me dead. 
He gets upset when I don’t react in a way he’d expect me to (i.e. when I’m not chatty, or annoyed, or simply tired). He gets cold and distant in a matter of minutes only to bounce back after eating or having a coffee. We’ve talked about this and he promises that he doesn’t want to cause me any fright but I feel anxious around him. Sometimes he isn’t even upset at me but he’d be disdainful at me nonetheless. Nothing I do seems to be the right thing… If I give him space, he snaps at me for not giving him reassurance, but If I do, he pulls away and becomes even colder.

1phpwfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1phpwfu/who_needs_a_house/,Who Needs A House,"My name is Prinstin, as in the college, a spit in the eye by my father and his father before him. Their expectations, reinforced by a name that gives body to this chain binding me to the same trade of labor as them. That's right, trauma. Of course the only way to break this chain is through a very sacred ritual called, being a loser. 

I know that doesn't mean I need to be homeless, just ignore the snakes in tall grass but who has time for that, if making money needed an end this would be it. Plus how else am I supposed to know what I need. I’ve been pretty passively self destructive in the past year, attempt after attempt at losing security, security for dick. I’ve been morbidly obese, I’ve turned that into pain and muscle for what, the judgments of people whom I could command just as easily. The whole world, given to me so I can watch it be given to the next snot filled white sheet waiting to wear the projections of idiots we have the privilege to join. As the youngest blessed with the responsibility of pulp, in order to gain a soul I’d need to define the one I had, leaving home, leaving everything, that’ll do it. That’s not me talking, that’s the Buddha. 

Of course I’m not ignorant, I understand that there are rules, if not of the palace then ones of nature. I left home with a bell tent, an electric stove, and a jug of water, all packed and portable on an old red wagon. In my backpack I had three changes of clothes I shouldn't need to clean for a bit, a sleeping bag and a lot of protein. I wasn’t coming back till I’d find a place to call     mine, and that wouldn’t be long. One night driving out the city to find some abandoned property or a natural bowl of some kind I could settle in, I fell into some fortunate graces, I found an apartment. 

Unforeseen road work forced me down unfamiliar trails, trying to find my way back, I got stuck in a whole new pocket I never knew existed. Going down hill I’m quickly hidden by trees and wild foliage that had originally obstructed the exit going under the highway. Swooping back around I’m immediately the subject of the most beautiful painting, beams of light shaped by tall pines and cottons. The moist air acts as colored gels, creating defined separations of cool tones in the fog. Tightly woven grass, an untouched golf course suited better for carpeting than any kinda sport, housing wildlife brave enough to approach this garden's prized fruit. In the middle of the clearing, drenched in blue light at noon, stood a musk red subsidised apartment building. Exposed brick with paint that has warped the wall into some artistic imitation of cracking sand flats.

 The soft red invasive glow of the apartment keeps me hesitant. I parked on the green, behind a tree where there was more than enough cover to keep the car from being discovered for days, assuming typical foot traffic. Stop the car, I sit in the stale recycled air and debate lighting up, I pull myself out into the quiet field. Shrouded in darkness I can’t help but to feel consciously rejected by it, every living thing has eyes, even blind things, why would the dark be any better. I light a joint as paranoia creeps up on me till I force myself into the protective glow of the warm apartment light, finding my way around to the front, I’m greeted by a scorching cold iron fence. After some more investigation I discover no viable entrance, just a hole that seemed designed to rip whatever was dumb enough to use it. About three feet in diameter and two deep, long? Hooks facing the inside and staggered, instead I toss my sleeping bag over the top. Prepared to mend any tearing I scale the fence, avoiding unevenly spaced spikes at the top before landing in the courtyard. 

The iron fence turned an almost rust color before disappearing behind walls of rose bush, its design reaching towards the sky thanks to countless red flakes, I relight. Lettering the checkered patterned grass sat different and perfectly trimmed sculptures depicting the middle of some kinda chess game. Heavily favoring one side, the one sign of their stage being a bleeding marble trail following the path of every sculpture. The majority of which are tall and budding with white sage, the other team being reduced to dried shrubs, sustaining itself off its own muck. Following a carefully maintained path I step up onto the first exposed landing, looking over the garden I finish my smoke then drop it onto crumbling concrete.

Stepping inside I feel the world stop and start again as I take in the stark change in environment. It’s extremely white, looks like everything was painted then painted again. On the outside there was exposed brick with what was probably lead paint flaking off, in complete contrast the inside was eggshell white, from tile to foam ceiling panel, layers of uninterrupted eggshell paint. Squeaky soft grips accompany my walk along with drips of dew that have accumulated on my jacket outside, seamlessly mixing paint and mud. The entry way is a tight but tall corridor with a counter to my right, built into the wall and out of service. Continuing down it opens to a lobby with bronze mail boxes, all the furniture having an annoying amount of height, like it was meant to be barside.  

Thud ! . . . .

My attention was ripped away by a thud coming from the staircase. A loud and lone- 

Thud ! . . . .

Thud! . .

Thud!!

From just around the corner comes a beefy green head of lettuce. Flopping diagonally down the stairs and slapping the wall, before rolling and ending at my feet. Beautiful shades of purple that fade into green, a lady comes down the stairs in this silk green gown that changes with the light. Sitting on top, a reddish orange bob with jack-o-lantern teeth, delicate and bright eyes protected by frames that match. 

“I’m so sorry, I tried to stop it.” She called out on her way over. 

“Oh, that's fine. I was just kinda-” 

-Looking for a place to squat. Does she want to know that? Does she need to know?

Standing at the base of the staircase she softly says. “Hello?”

“Uh sorry, I was looking for a place. I wanted to rent a place to stay.” 

“That’s great, I’m married to the landlord.” She starts over with a pip in her step. “He just went out to get some supplies for the tenets.” Bent down to get her lettuce and snaps up. “ You… could imagine how that is.”

She speaks up in place of my silence. “Would you like to come up and wait for him?”

“Oh, ma’am I don’t-”

“Pfft it’s fine, we take meetings in our living room all the time.” She turns and without another invitation, or a single sign of… anything. Still I’ve never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, if nothing then I might get a meal out of this experience. So I followed the women with the beefy greens. 

The staircase that had been parsley hidden by the accompanying archway, an odd lack of light I hadn't noticed from where I was standing just beyond the threshold. But the first thing I noticed wasn’t the shadows that danced around an invisible light source, it was an uncanny feeling brought on by a missing detail. It was the complete lack of corners, the whole room was cornerless. Scoops in the linoleum creating steps, while the whole cavern mimicked the same painting mishap as the lobby. But here collecting in the corners, making them disappear. If that wasn’t enough the staircase was also free standing, if not it’s supported by some optical illusion, maybe that’s why the lights had been so… wavy? Rolling the question around in my head I follow the landlady up to the tenth and top floor, where the walls once again returned to brick. 

We walk out of the open stairwell and quickly find ourselves at her door. Opening up, I step into a thick cloud of earthy dough and steaming cloves. I’m met with a moss green shag carpet and the loudest little shit of a dog. 

“Would you mind taking your shoes off, we have little booties if you’d like some”

“No, I’m alright.” I take my shoes off and place them beside the door with my backpack. 

From the kitchen five feet away, she’s already flipping around greens in a pan before checking a pot of an unseen but fragrant green chili. “I’m sorry, could you take a seat over there. I’ll be done in a minute.”

I step over and past her island towards their living space, I sit in one of three different sofas all facing each other. A coffee table with a small radio sits in the middle of seven glasses with varying levels of green. I sink into a particularly itchy, probably felt lazy boy, a shitsu with its hair up comes hovering over on its coat. It sat at the end by the lazy boy, looking at me. I take a deep breath and scan the room breaking eye contact with the little guy, Christmas gnomes and tiny deer figurines define the silhouette of random side tables, that’s when I noticed the room was lit by candles. Flickering, dancing lights projecting scenes of tiny villages being ravaged by beastly deer, the twilight forest outlined by moon light divided into beams of yellow ending with oak trimmings before meeting a jungle green carpet. The people rejoice as the dog restores balance to their violent ecosystems, and I sit snuggled up, high as balls. 

 I watch as gnomes get together for a hunt. They gather bobby pins and harvest strips of wood from trimmings, festivals in preparation or remorse take place as they prepare their battlements. Isolating a deer that they spend days catching up to, just to scare it off again, their weapons looking more and more like props with every performance. I watch their victory take place as the forest swirls around us, and the landlady steps in with a plate of fried… things. Spendly little stems coming off one big bulb, pressed in olive oil with spots of cumin. Green of course. She places it on top of the radio and pours one green cup into another before grabbing that glass, giving it a little stir to mix the different shades.

She takes a seat and a sip before lowering the glass to her side. “It’s been great, we’ve never been happier. Just last fall we were out on the streets, we’re registered real estate agents. But independent work hasn’t been kind since all the properties have been going to some private business.” She recrosses her legs before another sip, focus waning. “Being out in the wild, relying on your own way of things. Learning what you can, from nature. Attempting not to fall off. That or starting a new way, get responsible for muck. Not by choice, just how things are. Build off of someone's kingdom, knowing it will erode like the largest mountains. Just like every brick, every crop turning to rot.”

She smiles and flicks her eyes from the ground back to me. 
“Crosses to bare.”
“Baring to cross again.”
“And again.” 

“Began in a familiar reign”
“Get lost, attempt to find,”
“what you know you won’t regain”

“Again and again”

“Ris’in from twilight lighted dirt.”
“Just to lay when the light falls.”
“It’ll hurt” 
“Before it’s done.”

“Once they're gone, it’s for me to be done.”
“Again and again”

Her eyes glazed over, her focus long passed where my head sat. She’d gone blind in the span of a few words, almost impossible not to notice the cataracts set in. She says sheepishly “I don’t want to die”.  I regain motion in my legs and the decision to stay still is impossible, I am trembling. My spirit already leaning out the door, I focus on creating that path while shifting pressure to the arms of the chair. Lifting myself up her eyeline doesn't waver, rolling on the palms of my hands I carefully remove my hands. A perfect dismount snubbed by an inevitable creek in the wood. 

Her eyes pierce mine, a singular moving flame in her eyes dance, reseeding back out of sight. “He’s here”. I jump back and kick the dog, it yapps, I twist it in my legs bringing us both to the ground. Growls and the indifinable shape of its stuggle keeps me pined while it finds its way over my face. I come back up to find an empty apartment. Every trace of the land lady and her occupancy gone, leaving nothing but an unlit space and hints of nutmeg in the air.

 Unsettled I reach for the door and find the handle, feeling judged by the very recently inhabited room I don't look back, regretfully it doesn't matter. Before opening the door, the silence, the moon light leaking from under the door. Going out it's clear the power is out, an opened window, opisite the stairs, lights just beyond the room. Confidently heading for the stairs becomes harder and harder as uncertainty creeps in. But fear of what I know over powers what I don’t, to cope I let my arms rise ahead of me, keeping pace. 

Expectancy of the firet step keeps my fear from progressing to excitement. Walking down the hall, pass where I expected the stairs, I begin to expect a dip with every step. Stomping down the hall, arms steached out in front of me, I'd be a little embarrassed to see my crawl for safty. But who'd care, like a gnome hunting deer, I'd dance till dinner cooked its self. That lasted till I pushed something soft, then heard a crack, and chunks rolling down some steps, the sound following, fading away. 

Following the banister it's a couple floors till I see light. The second the steps were reviled I jumped to them, and move a floor down before catch my breath. Slowing pace I let my heart rest, not stopping my decent. The woman with a jack-o-lantern smile, wife of the landlord, so inviting. God! What's happening, why invite me to just… do that? When did she decide to do that? What was up with the… everything, the candles, the food. What was that spendily thing she cooked, and that dog, it could have been part of the carpet. Fuck, the carpet, my shoes, my bag! Was that the motivation the whole time? With the silk gown, a goofy ass smile and the beefy greens… the lettues… How did the lettuce hit the walls on the way down? Better yet, what did I push down? At the bottom of the steps I turn and see a pumpkin, broken and strune out, like it got all the way down before breaking. 

Fully invested in the mess, my focus is broken by a distant bell, followed by wet drips. 

“He’s here.” I quietly go back up the steps, making it to the sixth floor, right before the darkness. ",1,1765231608.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

​My neighbor over at Jobeez (and a few regulars) kept telling me I needed to post here, so here goes nothing.
​My fiancé and I opened our own spot, Ardent House Coffee, about 3 months ago. We’ve been working as baristas for a combined 15 years and decided it was finally time to bet on ourselves and try to break into the local scene.
​To be honest, we’re a bit of a ""hidden gem"" right now—we’re tucked away in the business center bordering Vista and San Marcos (off Sycamore and La Mirada). It’s not a main street storefront, but we’re trying to turn that into a vibe.
​We focus heavily on specialty coffee and making our own syrups from scratch. We just launched our winter stuff (Spiced Maple Sage, Peppermint Creme Brulé, Sweet Ginger) and are really proud of how it came out.
​We’re still learning and grinding every day, so if you’re in the area, come say hi. Since we’re trying to build a community, we’re super open to feedback on what you guys actually want to see in a shop.
​We also just got our pickup site running at www.ardenthouse.coffee if you're in a rush.
​Anyway, if you do find us through this post, just mention Reddit at the register and I’ll hook you up with 10% off. Thanks for reading!

I (28M) reached out to an ex-girlfriend (29F) from college (a “one that got away” situation) recently on a whim, it had been 8-10 years since we had last communicated in any way. We were both in our hometown for the holidays and I asked if she wanted to grab dinner or coffee.

We ended up exchanging pretty rapid texts and catching up for 4-5 hours. Heard from her again a few days later, then the conversation petered out. 

We’re from the same city initially, but now each live about an hour outside of it in different directions. About an hour and half apart from one another. 

I initially asked about coffee or dinner, and she had said she’d let me know when she was back in our city for the holidays. These were basically our first messages. 

She happened to run into my college roommate (who she knows I am still close to because of our conversation) and mentioned she was single, which he and his fiancée thought was kind of a random thing to say at the time. 

I’m passing through her city for work next week and I’m extremely tempted to reach out. It’s been about two weeks since we texted, and I’m worried that I am misinterpreting politeness for (at least casual) interest or that reaching out would make it seem like I have an agenda other than catching up (which, if I’m being honest, I absolutely do).

I’m a working adult who has had several relationships since this one, I have no idea why I’m thinking about it so much. 

Would you talk to an old ex that you ended on rough terms with just to be polite? 

Should I reach out again with an actual invite or just wait a few more weeks to see if she actually does around the holidays? 

Should I try to play it cool or not bother trying to hide my intentions?

Let me start by saying that Tanat is my main supplier of beans. I don't get into their higher end stuff like competition lots but I really like their roasting profiles and the coffees they highlight/pick, and some of the exotic processes they now push. 

I was thrilled to get into this calendar. It was an understatement to say how blown away i was when I saw the coffees in the calendar : lots of geishas, a lot of panama, some very prénom lots (excuse me Esmeralda 6NB ???). Aaaand that ends here. From the start of the calendar (I'm a little bit ahead, n12) every single coffee feels missed. No acidity whatsoever, muted tones and even grassy-like taste I only find on some bad roasted coffee from times to times. Can't even say there was a highlight from the samples I brewed. I even thought I had Covid, but then I brewed ""regular"" stuff which was... Perfect as usual..

When I saw this sub I was really... Sad actually.could my calendar been altered in some ways ? Really can't cope with how bad my experience is with this... I contacted Tanat today. 

Some precisions : 
- I brew with Holy Water 
- following their recipe 
- V60+Abaca
- Pietro at 8 (tried lower and higher), and 078 once to try something else
- compared with some recent purchased beans (from Tanat !), and yeah the beans from the two bags I got are really good (including a washed geisha)",1,1765231147.0,TanatAdventCalendar25,0,1.0,False

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to visit Christmas markets with, to have coffee and talk deep topics on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

Injury: a tried and true definition of ""don't judge a book by its cover"", Injury is a real sweetheart. She used to own a little shop that sold drinks and trinkets. She loves crafting teas, coffees, and juices. Her real name used to be Juicy prior to an incident involving an Ax. She refuses to talk about it. The poor thing lost her shop after being deemed too hideous for normal standards, and eventually became a monstrous local legend from living on the streets. Untrue rumors are spread about her, and it makes her quick to judge anyone that mocks her appearance. She can spit a venom from her mouth or footpads (like a non-toxic lemon juice irritant) when threatened.


Marmalade: another object from the Circus, this is a goofy and silly contortionist! She is quite tall, almost rivaling Powerline’s height. She is able to create patterns on her body via color changing cells (think chameleon or cuttlefish). Her leaves are actually wings, although she cannot fly for very long. She used to have a different name, but was given the name Marmalade after she was found rummaging through the trash, licking up a jar of the stuff.


Custard: my most wholesome and sweet oc, Custard is very very nostalgic, often thinking about the good old times and things she liked from years ago. She is so gentle and soft, with a light raspy voice. She sleeps a lot, and likely will hug you in her slumber on accident. She loves to embrace others. I love her with all my heart and I can't bear to see her be hurt or sad she's a comfort character,,,


Bear Trap: a personal favorite of mine, this is a quite aggressive object. Bear Trap tends to shout a lot, angry at the world. There is a kind soul deep within, but she struggles with herself, appearing scary and menacing more than she wants to. She is extremely skilled at fishing, and enjoys doing so. She secretly has a stuffed fish plush keychain as her most prized possession, and is embarassed about it when others find out. She has a crooked tooth, directly based off of my own crooked tooth! She has a speech impediment, here's a direct quote of how her speech works below. She struggles with the ""ih"" sound (using ""ee"" instead). She can say ""I"" as in 'eye', though.


""Bah! Peeck off the easy ones, useless een feesh

1phpiqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1phpiqe/should_i_ask_this_girl_out_tomorrow_or_wait/,Should I ask this girl out tomorrow or wait longer? Need advice.,"Hey everyone, I could use a little outside perspective.

There’s this girl at my job — she works in a different department so we don’t see each other constantly, but we cross paths most mornings. The thing is, talking to her feels really easy. No awkward pauses, no forced small talk — just natural conversation.

It started with simple “good mornings,” but lately it’s more than that. She’s the one who smiles first now, and she’s started asking me how my day is going before I even open my mouth.

We’ve talked about normal stuff, but also some personal things — she even told me about going to church last Sunday with a couple coworkers. I remembered she mentioned it and asked how it went, and she seemed genuinely surprised (in a good way) that I remembered.

There’s eye contact too — real eye contact — the kind where neither of us rushes to look away.

Here’s the part messing with my head:
She hasn’t mentioned a boyfriend at all. In conversations where it would’ve been natural to bring one up (like talking about church, plans, etc.), she didn’t say anything about one. My female friend even said, “If she had a boyfriend, she would’ve dropped him into the conversation by now.”

I’ve also noticed she doesn’t act “polite and distant” — she acts comfortable. She listens, asks follow-up questions, and doesn’t seem in a rush to walk away.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

I’m planning to ask for her number tomorrow. I have a line ready — something simple like, “We should grab coffee sometime outside of work — what’s your number?”

Part of me feels confident and wants to do it.
The other part of me is overthinking everything.

I’m not new to asking people out, but she feels different — probably because she’s one of the prettiest girls I’ve ever talked to, and the vibe feels genuinely mutual.

I prayed this morning and basically said: “If this isn’t right, make the interaction awkward or hard,” and instead it was one of the easiest conversations we’ve had.

Now I’m sitting here with butterflies wondering:
Should I go for it tomorrow? Or would waiting another week make more sense?

I’m not trying to rush anything — I just don’t want to drag it out and miss the window either.

Any honest advice is appreciated.

**8. Salt seasons sweet as well as savoury**  
  
The reason we’ve all gone mad for salted caramel and pretzels in brownies is simple: salty-sweet tastes delicious. Salt doesn’t just add its own flavour — it amplifies and balances the flavours already there, whether that’s savoury or sweet. In desserts, where sugar can sometimes overwhelm, a pinch of salt reins it in and lets the other ingredients shine. 

Scientifically, salt reduces bitterness and balances sweetness, so flavours like vanilla, fruit or spice pop more vividly against the sugar. Whenever you’re baking, a small pinch of salt can make a big difference. And with anything involving caramel, chocolate or coffee, a more generous seasoning takes it to another level. 

Remember too, “salt” doesn’t always have to mean flaky salt — it can be salted butter, miso, salted nuts, anchovies (okay, maybe not anchovies) or soy sauce.

In this miso caramel brown butter pretzel cheesecake (pictured above), pretzels add a salty element to balance the sweet alongside the miso, and the latter also gives you that umami depth.

​To be honest, we’re a bit of a ""hidden gem"" right now—we’re tucked away in the business center bordering Vista and San Marcos (off Sycamore and La Mirada). It’s not a main street storefront, but we’re trying to turn that into a vibe.
​We focus heavily on specialty coffee and making our own syrups from scratch. We just launched our winter stuff (Spiced Maple Sage, Peppermint Creme Brulé, Sweet Ginger) and are really proud of how it came out.
​We’re still learning and grinding every day, so if you’re in the area, come say hi. Since we’re trying to build a community, we’re super open to feedback on what you guys actually want to see in a shop.
​We also just got our pickup site running at www.ardenthouse.coffee if you're in a rush.
​Anyway, if you do find us through this post, just mention Reddit at the register and I’ll hook you up with 10% off. Thanks for reading!

1phpd2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/plancoach/comments/1phpd2i/plancoach_faq/,plancoach FAQ,"# App basics

**Does this little app actually work?**

Absolutely. Check our community and App Store reviews (all real; a solo dev can’t orchestrate fake reviews).

We’ve seen many people improve studies, work, and life with this app.

But no app fits everyone, so try it and see if it suits you.

# Task-splitting tips

**How do I choose how fine or coarse the steps are?**

Tell the coach the granularity in natural language, e.g.:

* I’m going to drink water; make the steps coarser/finer.
* I need to finish math, chemistry, and physics homework; make 3 steps for each (e.g., when using Miss S).

**Let the coach know your current state**

The coach plans starting from your present state. State can include physical state (“I’m on my phone”, “I’m in bed”) and mental state (“I’m irritated”, “I’m sleepy but won’t sleep”).

# Pricing

**What should free users expect in plancoach?**

No ads. plancoach is basically “no full free tier.”

The free tries are just to help you test if the app fits you.

Each update resets to 6 free trial splits. If you like it, consider joining early.

**What’s the price?**

*The lifetime premium is rising monthly.*

This price will likely go up, or lifetime might be removed leaving subscriptions only.

It increases one to two tiers per month.

Note: App Store price tiers mean some regions may not change when crossing certain tiers.

*Subscriptions increase irregularly.*

Existing subscribers are not affected.

**Will there be promos on Double 11 / Christmas / Black Friday?**

No.

Discounts would feel like a stab in the back to paying users, so we don’t plan to run such promos.

**When is the best time to buy?**

From the above answers:

If you want lifetime and haven’t bought yet, early-bird at 15 is best, next best is right now.

**Is this app worth paying for?**

Procrastination steals a life of possibilities. Consider two questions:

* If you don’t buy the app, what would you most want to do with the money?
* If this app changes your life (career, marriage, relationships, or just courage to ask back owed money), would that be worth the investment?

**Will subscription prices also rise?**

Yes.

Increases are irregular. Existing subscribers are not affected.

**Are early low-price buyers treated the same as later higher-price buyers?**

Yes. The rights in-app are identical.

**Do low-price buyers pay extra after prices go up?**

No.

**What other future price changes might happen?**

Besides increases, we may add a basic tier.

# Coach gameplay

**Why so many coaches?**

Each coach has a different role and strength.

Imagine:

* Sometimes you just need to start; once moving you finish naturally. Then you want the coach to get you started.
* Sometimes you need chain tasks (do A, then design the best order for B, C, D, and finish E before bed). Then you want the coach to cover every task and preferably assign time slots.

These two needs are very different.

In plancoach, you can use Coach W for (1) ultra-specific startup steps, and Miss S for (2) chained tasks.

**What if 4 coaches not enough?**

Download official coach DLC, or craft your own (in beta).

**Switch coaches**

Two ways:

* Swipe left/right on the home screen to switch quickly.
* If you have many coaches, tap the coach management icon on the home screen to go to the list and switch/manage.

**Rename a coach?**

Tap the coach name on the coach display page to edit.

# Growth system

**I’m already a member; why do I still need Execution/Influence/Coffee Beans?**

The growth system addresses a strong user need:

* Make real-world effort and growth visible.
* Get rewards that accumulate after finishing tasks.

From the app side:

* If you don’t open the app, it has zero impact. The growth system is meant to lure you back to practice intentionally where you want to improve.
* Some advanced features cost more to run than membership price, but people still need them and we want to provide them. We don’t want “SVIP” or “super member” tiers, so the growth system is a conditional way to access more features: you contribute effort; plancoach grants more capabilities.

It’s still in testing; numbers are being tuned from feedback.

**What are Execution/Influence/Coffee Beans?**

See growth system details: \[Nagivation to `GrowthSystemOverviewView` button\]

# Other Tips

**Change Desktop Icon**

You can ask the coach to ""Change my PlanCoach icon to a different one using Shortcuts on my iPhone.""

**App roadmap and long-term vision**

**Privacy: can developers see my data in plancoach?**

No. Apple’s restrictions are strict here.

We add some analytics to improve the app; that’s common. Data collected is strictly de-identified.

Also, “big vision beats small gains”—the risk of grabbing unnecessary data isn’t worth it for what we’re building, so we won’t take that risk.

**Will you disappear (run away)?**

No.

We’re driven by interest and self-actualization. 

**I want to request a feature**

We'd love to hear your thoughts. Submit via the feedback button.

[The feedback button](https://preview.redd.it/66r1s14wv16g1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=b41f074f1c591b0c2e63bf3510cfd8008473d3f3)

**The app has a bug**

Solo dev, no dedicated QA team—community (mostly Xiaohongshu, Douyin) kindly reports issues.

If you’d like, watch for our occasional beta testing to help stability and grow together.

**I submitted feedback but got no reply!**

We’d hate for people to spend time sending ideas or DMs and feel unanswered.

But as a solo dev balancing dev/ops/support, replying to everyone isn’t realistic.

Currently:

* We do read all feedback so far; if you haven’t heard back and it’s urgent, please ping again.
* The best response is improving the app.

Also, please check our “Roadmap” and “👀 What the dev is working on” before sending ideas—your wish might already be there.

**I saw an app that looks like yours. Same team?**

No.

We created the coach-style anti-procrastination category; many apps now imitate us.

We’ll keep observing and learning; if others do something great, we’ll learn from it.

**So many clones—should I choose them or you?**

* You can copy products, not capability or passion.
* The Xiaohongshu & Google Cloud Hackathon first prize went to plancoach, not the clones.
* Media like “晓白和林亦LYi”, “差评君”, “运营小丸子” recommended plancoach, not the clones.
* Choosing us encourages innovation and resists “bad money drives out good.”

**Will the app keep being developed? What’s the end state?**

The roadmap designs need 1–2 years. If achieved, it’s a win-win:

* We’re proud of this little app.
* Users feel it’s extremely handy.
* The industry sees the value of “long-termism + creativity,” becoming healthier and more user-serving. """"""",1,1765230352.0,plancoach,0,1.0,False

I’m not too sure how my body will process food after a long period of time without it, since before this the most restrictive diet I’d done was fasting for every 2 days and then eating on the third, if I decide to take this to a couple of months instead of my original plan, will I get really bad bloating or something? I’m curious on how long I can last on this sort of diet without major health issues?",1,1765229973.0,intermittentfasting,3,1.0,False
1php6ub,https://i.redd.it/cm9k41hru16g1.jpeg,We almost lost a $500K deal because our founders couldn't agree on priorities. Then we started running weekly meetings the right way.,"Here's the uncomfortable truth most founding teams won't admit: **you're probably not as aligned as you think.**

One founder is prioritizing product. Another is obsessed with sales. The third is worried about burn rate. **And nobody's actually talking about it in a structured way.**

So what happens? You make decisions in Slack threads at 11 PM. You contradict each other in front of the team. You waste entire days re-litigating decisions you thought were already made.

**I've seen this kill momentum at dozens of startups. Including ours.**

We used to treat founder meetings like an optional check-in. *""Let's grab coffee and sync up.""* It felt collaborative. **It was actually chaos.**

Then we nearly blew a major partnership because two of us had completely different understandings of our go-to-market strategy. The prospective partner asked a basic question about our pricing model and got two different answers in the same meeting.

**That was the wake-up call.**

We rebuilt our founder meeting from scratch. **Made it time-bound, structured, and ruthlessly focused on decisions instead of updates.** Added a metrics review so we were debating from data, not gut feelings. Started documenting every decision with an owner and deadline.

**Within a month, everything changed.**

We stopped rehashing the same arguments. Our team stopped getting mixed signals. We made faster decisions with more confidence. And honestly, we started trusting each other more because the hard conversations had a place to happen.

**I documented the exact framework we use:** the agenda structure, how to prepare, how to avoid the most common mistakes (like turning it into a status update wasteland), and how to scale it as the company grows.

**It covers:**

* **Why most founder meetings fail (and how to fix it)**
* **The 4 principles of high-impact meetings**
* **A step-by-step agenda that actually works**
* **How to make decisions faster without creating chaos**

1php6i5,https://v.redd.it/9vghbyzou16g1,App helped cure my chronic migraines and looking for beta testers,"Hey all, I recently learned that common foods like coffee, cheese, pickles etc were ruining my life

Every 2-3 weeks I’d have a debilitating migraine lasting 1-3 days. It was really bad and would put me at risk of falling behind at work causing me to have to work hard on the weekends always just in case I’d get a migraine during the week.

Recently I made an app that scans ingredient labels and shows you scientific literature about each ingredient to warn of the risks. The real issue this is meant to tackle is avoiding negative side effects from the products you use. 

This led me to expand the utility to be a conversational symptom tracker. I used this tracker while I was building it and it led me to find out that it was TYRAMINE sensitivity that was causing everything. I am really happy and proud to say I haven’t had a migraine in a long time now. 

This feature is still unreleased but you can help it work for yourself and others by downloading the app and sending me a chat so I can enable the features for you. I’ll make sure to follow up and build/change things to suit your needs!

1php6ai,https://i.redd.it/gpmkretlu16g1.jpeg,Here are the secrets and pro tips to get the best results from Google's Gemini AI for work - and fun.... Plus 15 great prompts and use cases to test out the power of Gemini,"TL;DR Summary:

* **Don't Chat, COMMAND:** Gemini hates fluff. Stop saying please. Be robotic, precise, and structural.
* **The Sandwich Rule:** For massive uploads (250,000 words / 1M+ tokens), put your instructions *after* the data, or ""anchor"" them at the end.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Never describe a coding error or a physical problem; upload the video/image. Gemini is native multimodal.
* **One-Shot Decks:** Don't ask for outlines; ask for fully coded, exportable presentations .
* **The Killer Diff:** ChatGPT is a conversationalist; Gemini is a research agent with a photographic memory.

I’ve spent the last month stress-testing Gemini 3 against GPT-5.1, and I realized 90% of people are getting bad results because they are ""GPT-brained."" They treat Gemini like a text predictor.

Gemini 3 isn't just a chatbot; it's a **multimodal processing engine**. If you prompt it like ChatGPT, you are driving a Ferrari in first gear.

Here is the deep dive on how to prompt Gemini for god-tier results.

# Part 1: The Core Philosophy (Gemini 3 vs. ChatGPT)

|Feature|ChatGPT (The Conversationalist)|Gemini 3 (The Analyst)|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|**Best For**|Creative writing, nuance, chatting, soft skills.|Complex reasoning, massive data analysis, coding, video/image input.|
|**Prompt Style**|Likes fluff, encouragement, and persona building.|**Hates fluff.** Wants efficient, rigid instructions.|
|**Context**|Gets lazy or forgets the middle of long chats.|**1M+ Token Window.** It remembers everything.|
|**Output**|Text and standard code blocks.|**Generative UI.** Can build interactive apps/charts/ Infographics on the fly.|

**The Golden Rule:** Treat Gemini 3 like a Senior Principal Engineer who is busy, has no patience for small talk, and needs the technical specs immediately.

**Gemini Prompting Techniques**

**1. The Anchor Technique (For Long Context)**

In ChatGPT, you usually put instructions first (`Summarize this text: [Text]`). Gemini 3’s 1M token context window reads differently. If you dump a 500-page PDF or a codebase, specific instructions at the top can get ""diluted"" by the massive data following it.

**The Fix:** Load your massive context (PDFs, Videos, Code) first. Then, use an **Anchor Phrase** to trigger the processing at the very end.

**The Prompt:**

\[Upload 3 PDFs and a Video\]

\--- END OF CONTEXT ---

**ANCHOR INSTRUCTION:** Based *strictly* on the data provided above, identify the three biggest discrepancies between the video evidence at timestamp 10:45 and the written executive summary. Quote the text directly.

**2. The Generative UI Hack**

Most people ask for text summaries. Gemini 3 can render **Generative Interfaces**—custom interactive widgets that live in the chat. Don't ask for a recap; ask for a tool.

**Bad Prompt:** ""Summarize this Q3 earnings report PDF.""

**Good Prompt:**

I am uploading the Q3 Quarterly Report. Generate an interactive dashboard that tells the story of these results. Include toggleable charts for revenue vs. cost and a 'Risk Analysis' slider. Render this as a Dynamic View / HTML artifact.

*(Result: Gemini won't just write text; it will code a mini-app for you right in the window.)*

**3. The Instant Deck Architect**

Stop asking for slide outlines that you have to copy-paste manually into Slides / PowerPoint. Gemini 3 can create a slide presentation you can export to Slides or a PDF with one click. Once you export to Slides you can easily edit it and add images from Nano Banana

**The Prompt:**

\[Upload a 20-page whitepaper PDF\]

Create a presentation that has 10 slides. Use a dark, modern theme with blue accents. Follow this {outline and additional instructions}

*(Result: You get a single downloadable file. You open it, and your slides are done, styled, and animated.). You can export the slides to PDF or into Google Slides with one click. Gemini creates great 12-14 slide presentations - ideal length for most PPTs*

**4. The Deep Research Agent (Competitive Intel)**

This is the ultimate business hack. Gemini 3 can traverse the web, read multiple pages, and synthesize it into a strategic report without hallucinating (if you force citations).

**The Prompt:**

I need a competitive deep-dive on \[Competitor Name\]. Execute the following research loop:

\- Search for their pricing page and identify any changes in the last 6 months.  
\- Scrape G2 and Capterra for their top 5 recurring customer complaints.  
\- Find their latest press release and news stories for this company regarding latest features.  
\- Compare this competitor's site {web site} to my web site {URL} and provide opportunities to win against the competitor on product information and thought leadership content.  
\- Synthesize this into a table comparing their weaknesses to my product's strengths. Cite every single claim with a specific URL.

**The Superpower Key (@ Extensions)**

Gemini's true superpower is the **@** key. Typing that symbol unlocks Extensions, allowing you to pull real-time data from your Google apps. It connects the brain to your personal data.

* **@ Google Drive:** ""read my PDFs"" -> @`Google Drive summarize the 'Q3 Financial Report' PDF and pull the 3 biggest risks.`
* **@ Gmail:** ""find that email"" -> @`Gmail Find the email from 'HR' about 'Open Enrollment' and list the deadline.`
* **@ YouTube:** ""watch this video"" -> @`YouTube find a video on 'how to fix a leaky faucet' and give me a step-by-step text summary.`
* **@ Google Maps:** ""find a spot"" -> @`Google Maps find a coffee shop near Central Park that is open now and has 4+ stars.`

1php5q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1php5q1/the_main_story_as_a_tension_inducing_device_never/,The main story (as a tension inducing device) never clicked with me.,"In theory, you, the player, are supposed to be energised about chasing your child's kidnapper.

But y tho?

**First problem**, there is the time skip.

Cold sleep is a very old trope\*.  In cold sleep, a year or a thousand years can elapse without any awareness.

Therefore, when I left the pod, and saw that human bodies had rotted down to clean skeletons, I guessed that the kidnapping could have happened 345 years ago.  Or 50 years ago.  Or 123.  Any valid (large) number.

...so I assumed that my child was already dead, like Ripley's daughter in Aliens.  

No rush.

After talking to Codsworth, the duration was (slightly) narrowed down - I knew that more than two centuries had elapsed.  So there was less than a 1% chance that the kidnapping happened in the same year that my character thawed out for the second time.  After hearing that news, I felt that it was completely pointless to rush my actions.

**Second (Nora version)**: 

Imagine that Nora:

(a) did do the dumbest option, and rushed after the kid, straight from the vault, equipped with blue pajamas, a pistol, three stimpacks and a dozen coffee mugs.

and 

(b) somehow, through a mad combination of intuition and luck - there was no time skip, and everything worked perfectly for her - she got the spawn back immediately.

...where would she keep it?  Where would she find 5,000 nappies?  Who would help her raise the child?

**Second (Nate version):**

Same as the above, but worse.  Nate cannot lactate, so he would simply be ""saving"" his baby to watch it die.  There are zero infants in the Commonwealth, human or animal, so no milk sources.  At 3 months old, and with an undeveloped immune system that is 2 centuries out of step, I doubt his child would thrive on a diet of pureed bloatfly.

\*one old example is The Door into Summer (1956 novel).

Like Fallout 4, it uses cold sleep as a plot device, takes place in the USA after a nuke war, and a large chunk of the plot revolves around rival companies that build robot butlers with cheesy names.",0,1765229871.0,fo4,2,0.5,False

1php33d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1php33d/aeropress_grinder_is_out/,AeroPress Grinder Is Out.......,"I having nothing positive to say about the grinder, sorry :( The handle design is very poor. It is straight and awkward, no bend for ergonomics like most other grinders. The little handle piece coming of is a poor design decision, and even worse that another little piece can also detach and get lost. I should not have to use a specific motion to keep the handle on. If I were using this to grind espresso then the ergonomics and flimsiness of the handle would cause many issues. The size is meant to fit in the AeroPress, I believe this is the only selling point for them, except there are already grinders that do this, fit much better, have better ergonomics, and are 2-3x cheaper. The burrs are very small, that is not very much cutting space, I can't imagine how long it would take to get through a dose for espresso. I feel like they pushed this out before it was adequately tested, it brings nothing new whatsoever, and it is incredibly overpriced. Even the lifetime warranty on the burrs is not useful. They will replace them due to damage, like a stone maybe, but not from normal wear. Personally, I do not want burrs past 3 years maybe unless sharpened. I doubt they will do this for free, no one does. AeroPress was bought out awhile back, and since then they have been a money grab and everything is poorly thought out and overpriced. I think they are hoping that people obsessed with the AeroPress will buy this, and people who do not know any better, which many people first get into caring about coffee quality and grind with an AeroPress. The AeroPress brand was built on approachable, affordable coffee, this is not that at all. This will fizzle out, and I am sad that no innovation was introduced. I feel like they wasted their money creating a grinder that has some of what many grinders already have at a third the price. The AeroPress name is being run into the ground as a money grab trying to ride out any nostalgia left on the name under the original Adler ownership.",6,1765229695.0,AeroPress,6,0.75,False

The weeks grew colder, the air sharper with the approaching winter. Leaves began turning gold and red, a slow burn that mirrored the unease growing inside me. The townsfolk stared at me more often than ever. Their eyes were sharp like knives waiting to deliver the killing blow. With the colder weather, colder looks seemed to be descending as well.

At the diner, the usual chatter hushed when I entered. Voices fell silent like a switch had been flipped. The room felt heavier, oppressive. I walked in and sat at my normal bar stool in the corner. Clara was off. In her place was Roy, an older man who knew just about everything about everyone. His grizzled appearance didn’t mask the fact that he was fairly spry for his age and could flip omelets like you wouldn’t believe. I never really liked Roy very much, but as time went by, I took any pleasantries I could find, even if they weren’t meant as such. Roy was wiping out a coffee mug with an old rag, ignoring my presence. I pulled my stool closer to the counter and tried to strike up a conversation with him.

“Do you ever... I don’t know, talk with folks here?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

His eyes bored holes into me, hard and cold.

“We talk. Just not with folks like yourself.”

I nodded as if I knew what he was talking about.

“Why is that?” I responded.

He suddenly stopped cleaning the mug. His eyes clouded over with mystery.

“You need to watch what comes out of your mouth around here, boy.” He said in a direct tone. “We have been here a long time now, and we will always be here. People like you try to come in here and poison what we have. We can’t have people coming in and ruining our little town. You understand what I’m telling you, boy?”

His demeanor completely changed. He was now leaning toward me, one elbow resting against the bar top. I started to feel threatened by his presence, but he had not yet done anything egregious. The silence lasted too long for his liking as he leaned closer toward me.

“Let me spell it out for you. Leave this place and never come back, or you’ll never leave at all.” He said, staring daggers into my soul.

With that, I had heard and seen enough. I slipped off the barstool, scrambling to grab my jacket. He leaned back off the bar top and grabbed another mug to clean. As I walked toward the door, I stopped and turned to face him.

“This is my home now, too. I won’t leave because of some dumb ass tradition, or whatever it is.” I said confidently and with more intensity than I intended.

He looked up at me and smiled.

“Well then, you’re dumber than you look, boy.” He said plainly and continued washing the mugs.

I made my way outside and over to my truck. As I headed back up the hill, I couldn’t get Roy’s words out of my mind.

“Leave and don’t come back, such horseshit,” I mumbled as I headed towards the cabin.

Now, more than ever, I needed to see her. I needed to see Clara.

Clara was more distant now. When I asked her about Roy and what he meant by leaving, she brushed me off.

“It’s just tradition,” she said quickly. “Nothing to worry about, I promise! People just get worked up because they’ve spent their entire lives here, and the festival is all they have left.”

I accepted her response because it came from her, but I did notice some odd behavior that I had not seen before. Her hands shook, and her eyes darted nervously when she thought I wasn’t looking. I was so confused as to why this was all happening, and now Clara was starting to act strangely as well. I had to do something before I went insane.

The next day, I made a plan that I really didn’t want to follow through with. The plan was for me not to talk to Clara for a full day. I didn’t want to make her suspicious, so after the day of not talking, I would sneak down to the diner and wait. Once she got off her shift, I would follow her and see where she went. I had never been to Clara’s house or even known where she lived, for that matter. She had never invited me over, and I never really asked about it either. I was going to find out what was going on one way or the other.

The next evening, I put my plan in motion. I stonewalled her the entire day. She texted me a few times, but I resisted the urge to respond. She eventually stopped trying. The plan was going exactly as I wanted. I made my way down the hill toward town and parked next to a snow fence just before you round the curve onto the asphalt road. I walked from there over to Harlan’s to wait for Clara’s shift to end. I followed her as she left the diner. I put my hood up, staying just far enough behind to not arouse suspicion. She moved with a strange purpose, slipping into the forest shadows, creeping and skulking through town. I kept following at a distance as she entered the forest at the edge of town. The deeper into the woods I followed, the thicker the silence grew. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, their branches clawing at the dark sky. She rounded a turn in the path, and I lost her for a moment. I picked up my speed, just enough to catch up before she got too far. I rounded the curve, and there she was. She stood in a clearing surrounded by gnarled trees, a ring of scorched stones surrounding it.

In the center of the circle, a blackened fire pit still smoldered. Around it, ashes and what looked like bits of old bone lay scattered. Once I recognized what I was seeing, I crouched down and quickly clambered behind a tree. I couldn’t see Clara anymore. The air was getting colder and darker. My heart was hammering in my chest, breath catching.

‘What am I looking at?’ I asked myself.

As I pondered the question, the coppery scent of blood thickened in the breeze. Low, rhythmic chanting emanated from the trees around the circle. The chants rose like the ocean tide, growing louder and deeper with each line. A cold shiver crawled down my spine.

I peeked from behind the tree and saw them. A group of townsfolk standing in the circle, eyes glazed, faces expressionless. They were all wearing black robes, except for one. Clara was there; her head bowed in prayer. She was wearing a white dress that extended down past her feet. She had stripped her work uniform off and had donned this beautiful silk gown that fluttered in the chilled wind. I scanned the group and saw Tom, standing stiff and silent. The firelight flickered on faces, old and young, men and women alike. Gene and Jimmy were there, along with everyone else in town. They were all here for whatever this was.

They chanted in a language I didn’t understand, as a group of hooded figures made their way towards the center. As the group reached the center, the chanting stopped. Silence swallowed the clearing, leaving only the crackling of the fire to break it. My brain begged me for more. I needed to know what was actually happening. I slowly leaned out from behind the tree to get a better view. They were all standing completely still, heads down, muttering the same odd language I’d heard at the start.

When the prayer finished, they quickly removed their hoods and began to chant louder, holding their hands palm-up to the sky. In my horror, I had leaned too far out from behind my only cover and had been exposed. Tom saw me. His eyes turned sharply, locking onto mine. He shook his head side to side subtly, never breaking eye contact. I knew exactly what he meant. Don’t interfere, don’t be seen.

I crouched back behind the tree slowly and watched as the ceremony continued. Clara raised her arms toward the sky and screamed. The sound was oppressively loud, piercing the already trembling night. I covered my ears, fearing my eardrums would burst.

The others joined in with her in unison, the fire swelling in intensity as their voices became one. The crescendo from the eerie band was met with a massive ball of flame that rolled from the pit and into the night sky.

“What the fuck!” I said under my breath.

I stumbled backward, heart in my throat.

‘I have to get out of here,’ I thought.

I turned and ran away from the screams and into the night. It had gotten so dark, and the trees covered so much of the canopy that I could not see my hand in front of my face. I ran, hitting tree after tree and limb after limb, until I could no longer hear the screams.

I emerged from the forest and back onto the road. My heart pounded in my chest, and sweat poured down my forehead, collecting on my shirt as it dripped.

“Fuck! What was that shit!?” I asked myself, panting uncontrollably.

I gathered myself and made my way back toward Harlan’s and, I hoped, back to my truck. As I passed by the diner, all the lights were off. There didn’t seem to be anybody inside or in the parking lot. I slowly crept my way past it, sticking to the shadows of the other buildings. I made my way past the grocery store and then the general store, both dark and lifeless.

“I’m home free if I can just get around this corner,” I muttered, trying to give myself the courage to make it back.

I successfully made it to the next turn and hid in the shadow of the print shop. Around the corner would be the covered bridge and the snow fence where I left the bronco. I leaned against the cold concrete, gathering the courage for the final push. I took a deep breath and rounded the corner. I skirted around the corner and immediately ran into what felt like a brick wall, knocking me off my feet. I fell straight to the ground, dazed and confused.

With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I scrambled to get up as quickly as possible, scared that one of those freaks would get me. I felt a heavy boot come down against my chest, forcing me to the ground. As I struggled against the immense weight, a calm, raspy voice rattled its way into my ears,

“Stay down a moment, son. Catch your breath.”

I panicked. Feeling a person’s boot pushing against my chest infuriated me.

“Get the fuck off me! Let me go!” I yelled through gritted teeth, fighting the unknown figure.

The voice crackled out from the darkness above me once more,

“Relax, Elias, it’s me, Tom!”

“Tom? What the fuck! Why are you doing this to me?” I exclaimed in return.

“Just relax, and I’ll show you.” He said calmly.

It took me a solid minute or two of struggling against Tom’s weight before the adrenaline subsided and I was able to quell my racing mind. I let my arms fall limply to the concrete. I was hyperventilating, and the adrenaline dump made me feel extremely dizzy.

“You ok now, son? Are you ready to stand up?” Tom asked.

I couldn’t say anything through my intense breathing, but I was able to nod twice, giving him the answer he needed. He took his boot off my chest and grabbed my wrist. With what seemed like hardly any effort, he pulled me to my feet.

“Follow me.” He muttered.

I was in such shock and disarray that I didn’t know what the hell was even happening anymore. All I knew was that I had seen something that I wasn’t supposed to see, and now I’m sure they wanted me dead. With no other option, I followed Tom into the darkness.

He led me back to his cabin, lit by a single lamp swinging on its chain. He hurriedly climbed the stairs and started unlocking his door. I stopped just short of the stairs, staring at the black robe he wore, now illuminated by the porch light. Seeing it threw me straight back to that moment when he locked eyes with me.

‘Why would he help me if he were a part of all this? Is he going to turn me over to them?’ These were the thoughts running through my head as he opened the door and turned to look at me.

“What’re you doin’? Don’t just stand there. Get your ass inside, now!”

I hesitated for a moment before following him inside his cabin.

I saw Tom trying to remove the robe as soon as I stepped inside. He was pulling at the waist strap as he pointed at a chair by the fireplace.

“Sit down over there. We’ve got a lot to discuss.” He said sternly before quickly disappearing into the darkness of the cabin.

I walked over to the fireplace and sat down. A few moments later, Tom returned without the black robe. Ironically, he had changed into the exact opposite, a cream-colored sweater and blue jeans. My eyes never left him as he meandered over to the pile of logs next to the fire. He picked up a few in his arms and turned his head to look at me.

“I bet your head is all kinds of crazy right now, ain’t it?” He said with a hint of sarcasm.

He began stacking the wood and lighting it, producing a warm flame that lit the entire room. I stayed silent, hoping that he would get the hint that I didn’t even remotely trust him anymore. He was going to have to explain himself in detail before I would believe a word he said. He sat down in a chair next to mine, studying the flames intently.

“You want a drink?” He asked.

I remained silent, my mind still reeling from what I had just endured. He stood up, grabbed a couple of glasses from the table, and a decanter full of whiskey. He poured both glasses half full and then offered one to me.

“Here ya go.” He set the glass down on the table in front of me and took a sip of his own.

The silence lingered in the air for a moment or two, the crackling fire filling the void between us. He finally spoke, cutting the silence like a knife.

“This town...” he began, voice low, “it survives on a ritual,” he paused for a moment, and then continued.

 “Every fall, at the harvest, they offer a sacrifice to keep the people young… and healthy.”

I stared at him, maintaining my silent demeanor.

“Ya see, the funny thing about this sacrificial business is that it’s gotten harder to perform over the years. The early years were easy, and nobody batted an eye. But now, it’s just a lot harder than it used to be.” He said, taking another swallow of whiskey.

I could see that the man was being sincere with his words. He was telling me the truth. Though all my being told me not to, I spoke up.

“Who?... Who do they sacrifice?” I asked.

Tom’s gaze didn’t waver.

“Outsiders. Every year, they pick someone not from here. Someone who doesn’t belong, someone who blows into town on a whim. Years ago, before all this technology, it was easy to make one person disappear. Nobody noticed.”

The room seemed to close in on us both.

“Why?” I asked, voice barely above a whisper.

“Because if they don’t, the town turns. The people become somethin’ else, somethin’ angry, savage.” He took a drink and continued, “And then, if they don’t get it done by the end of the winter, they all die, includin’ me.”

The weight of the words poured from his lips like molasses. A cold sweat broke out over me. I began to understand the reason why the people had acted that way toward me.

“You mean I’m next?”

He nodded grimly, staring into the fire as if searching for comfort.

“Afraid so, son, I must admit, I don't enjoy this type of thing, though. When I came back from ‘Nam, I was a different man, hell, I was a different person altogether. I had seen things that would make Friday the 13^(th) look like a puppet show.”

I looked at the floor, watching the fire’s light dance across the beams.

“Well, if I’m next, then why haven’t you killed me yet?” I asked plainly.

Tom smirked and blew air out of his nose in a slight chuckle.

“Elias, I could’ve killed you the day I met you. I could’ve killed you on the pavement earlier with my bare hands, did you ever stop to think that maybe I don’t want to kill you?” he asked, staring directly into my eyes.

“No, no, I guess not,” I responded half-heartedly.

Tom picked up his glass and downed the rest of his whiskey before standing and walking over to me. I flinched a bit as his imposing presence stood over me. He put his hand on my shoulder and spoke with a solemn tone that I’d never heard from him before.

“I’m tired, Elias, tired of livin’. It’s nothin’ but problems and attitudes nowadays. I should’ve died over there in that jungle, in that hell.” His eyes seemed to drift as if he could see something in the air that I could not. “I think I’m ready to hang it up, son, and I need your help to do that.”

With that, he patted my shoulder and began walking away toward the back of his cabin.

“Blankets are on the couch.” He remarked. “You'd best get some sleep. We have a big day tomorrow.”

I sat alone, pondering everything. The cabin, Harlan’s, Clara, everything. Was it all just a setup? Was any of it true at all?

The woods outside seemed darker now, alive with a hunger I could no longer ignore. Indigo Falls was a town built on blood to fulfill their needs. This year, I was their prize.",1,1765229692.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Every 2-3 weeks I’d have a debilitating migraine lasting 1-3 days. It was really bad and would put me at risk of falling behind at work causing me to have to work hard on the weekends always just in case I’d get a migraine during the week.

Recently I made an app that scans ingredient labels and shows you scientific literature about each ingredient to warn of the risks. The real issue this is meant to tackle is avoiding negative side effects from the products you use. 

This led me to expand the utility to be a conversational symptom tracker. I used this tracker while I was building it and it led me to find out that it was TYRAMINE sensitivity that was causing everything. I am really happy and proud to say I haven’t had a migraine in a long time now. 

This feature is still unreleased but you can help it work for yourself and others by downloading the app and sending me a chat so I can enable the features for you. I’ll make sure to follow up and build/change things to suit your needs!

1php2n8,https://i.redd.it/t0ryudgts16g1.jpeg,Here are the secrets and pro tips to get the best results from Google's Gemini AI for work - and fun....  Plus 15 great prompts and use cases to test out the power of Gemini,"# TL;DR Summary:

* **Don't Chat, COMMAND:** Gemini hates fluff. Stop saying please. Be robotic, precise, and structural.
* **The Sandwich Rule:** For massive uploads (250,000 words / 1M+ tokens), put your instructions *after* the data, or ""anchor"" them at the end.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Never describe a coding error or a physical problem; upload the video/image. Gemini is native multimodal.
* **One-Shot Decks:** Don't ask for outlines; ask for fully coded, exportable  presentations .
* **The Killer Diff:** ChatGPT is a conversationalist; Gemini is a research agent with a photographic memory.

I’ve spent the last month stress-testing Gemini 3 against GPT-5.1, and I realized 90% of people are getting bad results because they are ""GPT-brained."" They treat Gemini like a text predictor.

Gemini 3 isn't just a chatbot; it's a **multimodal processing engine**. If you prompt it like ChatGPT, you are driving a Ferrari in first gear.

Here is the deep dive on how to prompt Gemini for god-tier results.

# Part 1: The Core Philosophy (Gemini 3 vs. ChatGPT)

|Feature|ChatGPT (The Conversationalist)|Gemini 3 (The Analyst)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Best For**|Creative writing, nuance, chatting, soft skills.|Complex reasoning, massive data analysis, coding, video/image input.|
|**Prompt Style**|Likes fluff, encouragement, and persona building.|**Hates fluff.** Wants efficient, rigid instructions.|
|**Context**|Gets lazy or forgets the middle of long chats.|**1M+ Token Window.** It remembers everything.|
|**Output**|Text and standard code blocks.|**Generative UI.** Can build interactive apps/charts/ Infographics on the fly.|

**The Golden Rule:**  Treat Gemini 3 like a Senior Principal Engineer who is busy, has no patience for small talk, and needs the technical specs immediately.

**Gemini Prompting Techniques**

**1. The Anchor Technique (For Long Context)**

In ChatGPT, you usually put instructions first (`Summarize this text: [Text]`). Gemini 3’s 1M token context window reads differently. If you dump a 500-page PDF or a codebase, specific instructions at the top can get ""diluted"" by the massive data following it.

**The Fix:** Load your massive context (PDFs, Videos, Code) first. Then, use an **Anchor Phrase** to trigger the processing at the very end.

**The Prompt:**

\[Upload 3 PDFs and a Video\]

\--- END OF CONTEXT ---

**ANCHOR INSTRUCTION:** Based *strictly* on the data provided above, identify the three biggest discrepancies between the video evidence at timestamp 10:45 and the written executive summary. Quote the text directly.

**2. The Generative UI Hack**

Most people ask for text summaries. Gemini 3 can render **Generative Interfaces**—custom interactive widgets that live in the chat. Don't ask for a recap; ask for a tool.

**Bad Prompt:** ""Summarize this Q3 earnings report PDF.""   
  
**Good Prompt:**  
  
I am uploading the Q3 Quarterly Report. Generate an interactive dashboard that tells the story of these results. Include toggleable charts for revenue vs. cost and a 'Risk Analysis' slider. Render this as a Dynamic View / HTML artifact.

*(Result: Gemini won't just write text; it will code a mini-app for you right in the window.)*

**3. The Instant Deck Architect**

Stop asking for slide outlines that you have to copy-paste manually into Slides / PowerPoint. Gemini 3 can create a slide presentation you can export to Slides or a PDF with one click.  Once you export to Slides you can easily edit it and add images from Nano Banana 

**The Prompt:**  
  
\[Upload a 20-page whitepaper PDF\]  
  
Create a presentation that has 10 slides.    Use a dark, modern theme with blue accents.  Follow this {outline and additional instructions}

*(Result: You get a single downloadable file. You open it, and your slides are done, styled, and animated.). You can export the slides to PDF or into Google Slides with one click. Gemini creates great 12-14 slide presentations - ideal length for most PPTs*

**4. The Deep Research Agent (Competitive Intel)**

This is the ultimate business hack. Gemini 3 can traverse the web, read multiple pages, and synthesize it into a strategic report without hallucinating (if you force citations).

**The Prompt:**  
  
I need a competitive deep-dive on \[Competitor Name\]. Execute the following research loop:

\- Search for their pricing page and identify any changes in the last 6 months.  
\- Scrape G2 and Capterra for their top 5 recurring customer complaints.  
\- Find their latest press release and news stories for this company regarding latest features.  
\- Compare this competitor's site {web site} to my web site {URL} and provide opportunities to win against the competitor on product information and thought leadership content.  
\- Synthesize this into a table comparing their weaknesses to my product's strengths. Cite every single claim with a specific URL.

**The Superpower Key (@ Extensions)**

Gemini's true superpower is the **@** key. Typing that symbol unlocks Extensions, allowing you to pull real-time data from your Google apps. It connects the brain to your personal data.

*  **@ Google Drive:** ""read my PDFs"" -> @`Google Drive summarize the 'Q3 Financial Report' PDF and pull the 3 biggest risks.`
* **@ Gmail:** ""find that email"" -> @`Gmail Find the email from 'HR' about 'Open Enrollment' and list the deadline.`
* **@ YouTube:** ""watch this video"" -> @`YouTube find a video on 'how to fix a leaky faucet' and give me a step-by-step text summary.`
* **@ Google Maps:** ""find a spot"" -> @`Google Maps find a coffee shop near Central Park that is open now and has 4+ stars.`

1php27e,https://www.reddit.com/r/northpark/comments/1php27e/delah_coffee_house_north_park/,delah coffee house north park,"The owner of this establishment is a creep. He hires people based on one thing: his ability to prey on them. I worked at Delah in North Park for around a month and within a week of working there I noticed plenty of red flags. The location has only been open for around two months and people are constantly quitting within the first week. My first day there I had the owner yell at me for not knowing which cups to use for serving coffee (I was trained very poorly for a couple of hours by the manager) I noticed a theme of people being trained badly or not at all and then being scolded for not knowing what to do. The owner behaves very inappropriately towards his employees and sexually assaulted one of my coworkers during my time there. There are other miscellaneous things such as not receiving paystubs, inaccurate paychecks, withholding cash tips from employees, not following safety food guidelines and dating pastries, being asked to sign an NDA for any “personal conversations with the boss”. 
The manager would constantly complain about hiring people who can’t do anything but would only hire 18 year old girls with hardly any experience- further enabling the owner’s predatory behavior. The owner refuses to hire any men basically or people he considers to be old, queer or trans (mind you the shop is in the heart of north park..) I witnessed him yell at employees and pick favorites, refuse to give people their paychecks and blatantly embarrass employees in front of customers. I also noticed a theme of him favoring the young girls working for him, giving them random hugs or asking them inappropriate questions about personal lives. I experienced this myself multiple times while working at Delah. The atmosphere quickly became more toxic when a coworker was fired after being sexually harassed by the owner himself. The owner kissed his 18 year old employee during closing hours at work, spread lies about her flirting with customers, retaliated- and then fired her. This man does not deserve any money or support from the people of San Diego, or the North Park community. I advise everyone to boycott Delah and serve some justice to the people affected by this predator. Spread this message and be aware.

It is straight and awkward, no bend for ergonomics like most other grinders. The little handle piece coming of is a poor design decision, and even worse that another little piece can also detach and get lost. I should not have to use a specific motion to keep the handle on. If I were using this to grind espresso then the ergonomics and flimsiness of the handle would cause many issues. The size is meant to fit in the AeroPress, I believe this is the only selling point for them, except there are already grinders that do this, fit much better, have better ergonomics, and are 2-3x cheaper. The burrs are very small, that is not very much cutting space, I can't imagine how long it would take to get through a dose for espresso. I feel like they pushed this out before it was adequately tested, it brings nothing new whatsoever, and it is incredibly overpriced. Even the lifetime warranty on the burrs is not useful. They will replace them due to damage, like a stone maybe, but not from normal wear. Personally, I do not want burrs past 3 years maybe unless sharpened. I doubt they will do this for free, no one does. AeroPress was bought out awhile back, and since then they have been a money grab and everything is poorly thought out and overpriced. I think they are hoping that people obsessed with the AeroPress will buy this, and people who do not know any better, which many people first get into caring about coffee quality and grind with an AeroPress. The AeroPress brand was built on approachable, affordable coffee, this is not that at all. This will fizzle out, and I am sad that no innovation was introduced. I feel like they wasted their money creating a grinder that has some of what many grinders already have at a third the price. The AeroPress name is being run into the ground as a money grab trying to ride out any nostalgia left on the name under the original Adler ownership.

Our previous friendship has set the scene for a relaxed, supportive relationship which I’m really enjoying. I have teenaged children and a busy job, so this man and I only see one another once or twice a week - it works for us as he is also busy with work and friends.

He has an ex wife of a decade ago who he has nothing to do with (she left him). His ex girlfriend (together for 5 years)  is very much on the scene, despite them both mutually ending their relationship two years ago and her engaging in a new relationship some 6 months after that.

Early on, I realised they would talk and text regularly. She relied on him for a lot of emotional and physical support - fixing her car, driving her to appointments, doing extensive kitchen and bathroom refurbishment in her home. If she has a bad day at work or was feeling anxious, she would call him upset, and he would talk her through it, or meet her/ take her out for dinner. 

She regularly calls him early in the morning because she has intrusive thoughts that he has died overnight… Some of this stems from a traumatic event where their mutual co-worker died by suicide but had messaged her a goodbye note. The business was also pretty toxic and so they trauma-bonded further through these experiences. 

We’d been dating a few months when told me that he and his ex were going to a spa day, and he was worried to tell her about me, because she would be upset… potentially by a perceived loss of support. I found that difficult to hear. 

A few months into our relationship, he told he was going away to a country cottage for the weekend. He didn’t tell me who with - he has a fairly wide social circle - but on pressing him, he confirmed it was just the two of them. I expressed that I was uncomfortable with this and the overall lack of boundaries. That their relationship felt inappropriately close and it made me question if I would always be second place to her because she needs such support. Apparently her new boyfriend has expressed similar thoughts about their ongoing friendship. I also suggested she needed to address the intrusive thoughts with a therapist, and that by being so available for her, he was maybe feeding into the cycle of anxiety. 

After they’d been away, my boyfriend talked to her about it all, and suggested less regular contact out of respect for my feelings and because he wanted to focus on our developing relationship. She did not respond well, and sulked and refused to engage with him for weeks on end. This was distressing for him. I tried to be supportive, but it felt very manipulative of her. He claimed to have lost of a friend for life. 

A few months later, she’s back with calls and texts to check he’s alive. One day she arrives unannounced at his home with apparent heatstroke. He was supposedly the nearest “friend” on her journey home. He mopped her up and drove her home. It does sound like she was unwell, and I agree helping her was the right thing to do. I did argue that if it were me, I would have to be in death’s door before I sought help from someone who “wasn’t a friend anymore.”

My main problem is that the calls have increased again, and I feel like he’s trying to hide it from me. She rang the other morning claiming car troubles and asked him to “come and rescue her”. After the call, which he answered on speaker, he admitted to me that they’ve recently patched things up…
What upsets me most of all is that he didn’t volunteer this information at all before she rang out of the blue. I feel he only felt obligated to share it because I was witness to the call. 

He now says they text in little flurries once or twice a week. They’ve met up a few times in the last few months for a coffee, or for her to visit his cat that they adopted while together. She’s recently split up with her boyfriend. He also took her to see an old property he was thinking of buying… he didn’t think to invite me. I do believe he’s hiding the extent of their relationship from me. I don’t understand why - perhaps maybe as a weird way to protect me or control my feelings. I genuinely do not believe they are having any sort of physical relationship, but they’re still obviously bound together emotionally. He says he feels responsible for her and I just cannot fathom why. 

I am fiercely independent (to a fault) but I’m really trying to change and practice accepting help from others. But I cannot do this in a relationship where I do not feel safe. I also recognise I cannot change the way other people behave, only my reaction to it. But I need the full picture in order to make an informed choice. 

I lurch between “this is none of my business” to making myself desperately anxious and unwell worrying about it. Part of me feels I would be better walking away than to invest any more of my heart into this relationship. 

He tells me that he only wants me and that she is no threat to our relationship. But both of their behaviours tell me otherwise. I want to feel less insecure in the relationship, but I can’t see how when I see so many red flags. 

I want to suggest that he proactively tell me when they are meeting up. Part of me wants to see their messages too, but I worry this is an huge invasion of privacy. Deep down, I worry he doesn’t see a future with me, so is keeping the relationship with her “warm” so that it’s easy to reconcile later. 

Relationships over 40 are always going to be complex - we all have baggage. If IATA, what should I do to try and feel more secure? ",1,1765229551.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

Later on  , after the next group activity he asked me if he could take me out for walk which I said i’d love to go but our schedule were not aligned . After the next time we met ,he asked me for coffee which i said yes to . It was clear i wanted to get to know him better . We spent hanging out together two times alone not in a group , sitting by the beach and talking about alot of things . i really felt a spark with him and genuinely thought we could go somewhere.When the next group activity came , we actually had fun together but there were other people and we were mingling with all of them separately and at times together . In the group of people one guy asked me out before him and i don’t think they know each other that well to talk about me . I denied the guy before him and i wasn’t interested in him . Meanwhile i went out with another guy alone to get something from the grocery store. ( clearly for only getting something from the grocery store ) . That evening after he dropped me he didn’t text me or anything . Usually he text me how much fun he had and how he enjoyed my company . The next morning i got a text that days moving forward he would only like to hang out in groups x and that he would rarely come to the group activities . Mind you , he was sharing to other people that he would tried to consistently show up . He also made plans with me do a LOTR marathon .

I tried asking him why and he told me my job was too demanding which was total bs . I keep searching what did i do wrong. Did he stopped liking me all of a sudden or did he even liked me in the first place or he just needed company and someone to talk to . He knows i like him , my actions did show so he has nothing to be insecure about . Did i do something wrong or he just not that  into me ?",1,1765229508.0,relationship_advice,10,0.67,False

1phoomp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1phoomp/being_cc_affects_everything/,Being CC affects everything,"Just came here to say that being Covid-conscious affects so many moments of every day. 

I was just watching something that had footage of a concert in a stadium and I thought not what I used to think, which is that it looked cool, but now I just think that it’s something that I wouldn’t and couldn’t do. 

And then someone wrote me and said that we should get together for coffee or drinks sometime and my first thought was if that were even possible, especially since it’s now cold weather so eating outside would not be an option. And then how to even talk about it or bring it up and if I even want to. But I like this person so it also makes me sad to feel like this may create an obstacle in getting to know each other.

It’s like being cautious as my first thought to everything instead of other reactions. I’m so tired of having these barriers to a lot of fun and social things. And it seems the whole world is just living their lives. I know some of them will be in our boat at some point, but it seems that largely a lot are not.

We all met last year in our first year of university. We're all pretty introverted people and the 3 of them don't like to go out as much as I do, so our hang outs are usually just movie/game nights, going to the library or grabbing coffee together. For context, me and friend A are best friends, while friends B and C are best friends (the best group of 4 dynamic imo) but we're all fairly close (i am less close with friend C than A and B though). I'm the most outgoing of our group, as I have joined intramural sports teams, 3 clubs, a research lab, and joined our schools orientation coordination team, so I tend to have more acitivies weekly than they do. 
We used to all hang out very regularly last year and near the beginning of this year, but then I got really bad covid, broke and tore a ligament in my ankle, and got sick 3 more times, so I was unable to hang out for a bit. The past 3 times my friends have hosted a game night, it has been on nights that I've told them in advance I can't hang out, which I don't think is on purpose. They recently stopped really responding to me in the group chat, and I feel lile friends B and C never ask me to hang out or text me individually, I always have to initiate, while they initiate conversation and hang outs with friend A. I got a position that I was really excited and stressed about which I had to do 3 interviews for (which they knew I was stressed about) and when I found out that I got it i texted the group chat, but friend A was the only one who responded. I have asked everyone to hang out at least 5 times in the past 3 weeks but every time they say that they can't make it because they're too busy. I'm confused because I also have things to study for, on top all of my commitments, and still make time to hang out with my friends, and I see them post about going out to dinner together sometimes. I feel like they don't want to hang out with me anymore and I don't know why. This is why I'm starting to think they don't really want to hang out with me (except for friend A who I see regularly and am moving in with in the summer). 
I miss my friends and I want to hang out with them. I get that exam season is a busy time of year, but I don't understand why they can't take 2 hours to get some dinner and catch up before we all go home for the winter break. Do you think they're actually just that busy, or are they purposefully pulling away from me? Have I maybe done something to make them not enjoy hanging out with me?

I helped, and then exchanged numbers. 

Day at trip, she texted me and got emotional about the trip and showed she is an introvert and serious don't like to do fun publicaly but with the only ones she is comfortable. (Not sure why people feeel comfortable around me, it gives me cringe sometimes, may be I listen to them, whatever) 

So we talked, she got to know more about me with alot of questions, means alot of questions, I told she asked. 

She was goving me a sad vibe like she was sad or something. 

Then we kept our conversation face to face and I alsoo wanted to know like what happened tto her like in past. 

She shared few things and also cried. I felt sad. 

After few days, we were back from trip, She shared she was serious about me and wanted me to go on a date with her.  I did and went for coffee, I know I did wrong. But I couldn't do that for longer period. 

I stopped her and said not to move further. 

She started blmaing me and that when you have your woman at home don't seek outside.

Haley was the oldest child in our extended family, and I, the youngest, was born when she was already a teenager. Because of our large age gap, I don’t really remember her all that well; she exists as little more than a blurry bubble of recollection from a time when my subconscious was more picky about what it kept and what it tossed. When she disappeared all those years ago, I was too young to really understand what had happened.

I *was*, however, close with her mom. Haley was the only daughter— the only child *period* —of Aunt Claire, whose husband had died before I was even born. Needless to say, when Haley went missing, Aunt Claire was devastated. I don’t think she ever fully recovered from the loss. She and her daughter didn’t always get along, but at the end of the day Haley meant the world to her. Growing up, I became a sort of surrogate child for Aunt Claire. I spent almost as much time at her house as I did my own, and she could have said likewise. She was always visiting my immediate family and me, at least a few times a week, either for dinner, or for a birthday party, or to just spend some time with us. We certainly didn’t mind her company, and it helped that she lived right down the street from us. She was only ever a quick walk (or an even quicker drive) away.

Her death last month was devastating. It hit my family pretty hard. In fact, it probably hit us much harder than it did anybody else in our greater circle. Aunt Claire had her… *quirks*, to put it mildly, that tended to put off a lot of the extended family, but we spent so much time around her that we had gotten used to all of her little oddities. In fact, I wouldn’t have changed them for the world; they were what made Aunt Claire who she was. That said, her off-putting personality and our acceptance of it is probably the reason my family and I are the ones who got stuck with cleaning out her house after she died. There wasn’t anybody else willing to sift through all of the weird junk that she had collected over the years— and believe me when I say that there is a *lot* of weird junk in her house. We started going through it a couple of weeks ago and we’re still going through it now. I feel like we’ve hardly even made a dent. It’s been a difficult task, both emotionally and physically, but we’ve used the opportunity to bond as a family over our memories of Aunt Claire, and to remember her in a way that likely nobody else on this Earth could.

It quickly became clear to us that it had been a very, very long time since Aunt Claire had gone through all of the stuff in her basement, if she ever had at all. The place was stacked from floor to ceiling with all sorts of clutter that she likely hadn’t touched in years, and which had settled comfortably beneath a thick layer of dust and age. Hidden within this vast collection, buried beneath a box containing an ugly, rotting casserole warmer that Aunt Claire had bought off of a TV infomercial in the early 2000s and promptly forgotten about, is where I found Haley’s old camera.

The thing is a MiniDV camcorder from the late ’90s or early ’00s. I found it inside of a decent-sized hard shell case nestled snugly against several stacks of cassette tapes of the corresponding type. I remember the camcorder as existing in the same bubble that Haley does in my mind; I can vaguely recall several instances of Haley pulling out the camera at family events or get-togethers in order to record the day’s happenings, but I had never seen the contents of those recordings until now. All of the tapes are labeled with the footage that they contain, most with fairly mundane titles: *Uncle Jack’s 48th Birthday*, *A Trip to the Zoo*, *Summer Road Trip 2001*, et cetera. I wasn’t too interested in these tapes at first, but it eventually occurred to me that I would probably be able to find previously undiscovered footage of Haley and Aunt Claire together on them, and I didn’t want to pass up an opportunity like that. There isn’t really anybody left to remember them besides my family and me, after all, so I suppose we need to appreciate every memory of them that we can find.

I began sifting through the tapes a couple of days ago and have been fast forwarding through them until I find something worth keeping, which I then export to my laptop. I had to go online and buy a special adapter that is compatible with both the old school MiniDV and my modern computer, but after finding what I was looking for, the rest has been pretty easy. The project was going fairly smoothly for the most part, barring a few hiccups with the exported footage, when I came across a series of tapes labeled *Icarus Island*, presented in several parts. The title of the series, so simple and yet unlike any other in the entire collection, immediately caught my eye. The name sounded familiar, but I couldn’t recall where I had heard it from. Intrigued, I dusted off the first *Icarus Island* tape and plugged into the camera, hooked the camera up to my laptop’s screen, and began to watch.

It wasn’t long before I came to regret this decision.

Watching the *Icarus* *Island* collection makes me wish that Aunt Claire had found these tapes before she had died. If she had, she would have spared me the torment of watching them for myself. She also wouldn’t have gone to her grave wondering what had happened to Haley. Because if she had just watched these tapes, if she had just stumbled upon this collection one day and allowed her curiosity to get the better of her, then there wouldn’t have been any doubt in her mind as to what had become of her daughter.

I honestly wish there was still room for doubt in my own.

The Icarus Island Tapes

Tape 1

January 7th, 2002

  


Tape 1 begins with the usual gray haze and strangely soothing static that tends to start and end all of these old tapes. After a few seconds, the desaturated, low-definition, 4:3 video cuts in and we’re greeted to the image of Haley, in her late teens or early twenties, standing in front of her full-body bedroom mirror with her camera in her right hand. She stifles a yawn as she brushes her shoulder-length brown hair behind her ear with her free hand. There are no windows in frame, but even if the camera’s timestamp didn't say 5:42am, we can tell by the dim lighting in the room that it is well before dawn.

“Good morning,” Haley says through her yawn. “I *really* hope future Haley isn’t as tired editing this as I am filming it.”

She pauses, finally allowing the yawn to take over.

“Today is day one of our trip to Icarus Island, and we definitely have a long one ahead of us. First up is a nice, lengthy five hour drive to our hotel in Conifer Bay, then tomorrow morning we have another two hours by boat in order to reach the island itself. I figured I’d check in with you now before I meet up with the others— you know, really enjoy these last few moments of calm before the storm.”

Haley pauses again, forcing a smile despite her clear discomfort at being up so early. “Man, I can’t believe we’re finally doing this. It feels like I’ve been planning this whole thing since Freshman year, and now it’s finally happening. It’s all kind of surreal, if I’m being honest.” She sighs, which is followed by another brief pause. “Well, I should probably start getting ready. I told the others to be there by seven, and it’s only fair that I show up on time. See you out there.”

Haley stops recording. 

\_\_\_

There is a brief moment of fuzzy darkness before the video cuts to a shot of a house seen through an open car window. The sun is slowly crawling its way over the horizon behind the house, but it is still largely dark outside. Aging, frozen snow carpets the earth in the dim morning light. The timestamp reads 6:34am.

A woman who looks to be about Haley's age approaches the car. She is bundled up in a heavy white parka and matching knit hat and gloves, her long, blonde hair sticking out from below her hat. She carries a hefty duffle bag and a face that looks to be as about as enthused as Haley’s was earlier in the morning. 

“Good moooorning, Emilyyyy,” Haley says from behind the camera, mustering some exaggerated enthusiasm despite clearly being tired herself. 

Emily tries to maintain her grumpy scowl, but she can't help but smile at her friend’s bubbly demeanor. “You're *way* too excited to be up right now.”

“That's just my morning coffee hitting me,” Haley says as Emily walks in front of the car toward the passenger side. “I'm already on my second cup.”

The camera follows Emily as she opens the rear passenger door, throws her duffle into the car, closes the door, and enters through the front passenger side door. She climbs into her seat and clicks her seatbelt into place. “How'd I get you to talk me into doing this in the middle of winter?”

Haley smiles. “Because you’re my best friend and you love me.”

“Well, yeah, but we still could’ve done without the winter part.”

“If I want to have the footage for my senior project this year, then we need to do the filming now, before the semester picks up,” Haley says. “And besides, winter is the best time to do it, anyway. The hotel is cheaper, there’s no beach traffic, and they say *it* happened in winter, so filming around the anniversary really fits the mood.”

“Sure, if the *mood* is wanting to freeze your ass off. I'm just saying, we could get a *lot* more mileage out of this trip if we go in the summer instead. The weather will be nice, we can spend some time on the beach…” Emily smirks. “Meet some boys, maybe.”

“Uh-huh,” Haley says, “and what do you think Connor would say if I showed him this recording, huh?”

“For you!” Emily says, reaching for the camera. Haley laughs as she pulls the lens away from her friend, pointing it out the car window. “I meant for y—”

The video cuts. 

\_\_\_

It comes back at 6:58am as Haley, behind the camera, steps out of the car, which is parked in the street a few feet from a mailbox. She approaches the driveway of the house in front of which she parked, Emily partially visible next to her on the right side of the frame. A soft glow emanates from a front window, casting artificial light into the morning gloom.

“The lights are on,” Haley says, “which means Ryan and Sara are awake, at the very least.”

“*Or* their dad just left them on when he left for work this morning, and Ryan and Sara are both still up in bed.”

Haley briefly pans the camera to look at Emily. “Mr. O’Malley wasting electricity? I don't think so. I'll choose to have faith in Ry. Or I guess I have enough faith in Sara to drag him out of bed, at least.”

“I guess if I had to pick one of them to have faith in, it’d be Sara,” Emily says. “*She's* the one who got their dad's up-and-at-’em personality between the two of them.”

The two friends pass by an old van parked in the driveway. Haley focuses the camera on the vehicle as they briefly come to a stop. 

“There she is,” Haley says. “It's a little… *older* than I remember it being.” 

“Ugh, you really want me to spend five hours cooped up in *this* old rust bucket?” Emily says. “Can it even survive the trip?”

“Ten hours if you include the five on the way back,” Haley says. “And anyway, it'll be *fine*. Ryan's dad is being really nice by letting us borrow it, you know.”

“Are you sure we aren't just doing him a favor by taking this old girl out to pasture?”

“I'm sure it's sturdier than it looks,” Haley says. “This thing took us all the way out to the Grand Canyon when Ry and I were kids, and it made it just fine.”

“And that was, what, *ten* years ago?”

“Twelve,” Haley corrects her, “but I'm sure she's still going strong.”

Emily chuckles. “Again, whatever you gotta tell yourself, girl.”

The two of them stop in front of the house’s front door. Haley knocks, and after a few moments of commotion, the door comes open to reveal Ryan, a skinny, tall young man, standing in the door frame. He smiles upon seeing his two friends.

“Good morning, ladies,” he says merrily, taking Haley into a one-armed hug. The camera briefly turns toward Haley's face as she enters the embrace, before returning to its original position as Ryan does the same thing to Emily.

“Ryan saying more than two words before 8 in the morning?” Haley says. “What planet are we on?”

“Seriously,” Emily says. “Don't tell me you're gonna make *me* the only grumpy one right now.”

“I've already been up for like an hour,” Ryan says. “How can I sleep when I know that today's the big day?” He steps out of the door frame and into the house. “Come on in. We were just eating breakfast.”

Ryan disappears into the house, prompting Haley and Emily to follow after him. He leads them down a dimly lit hallway which opens up into a living room on the far end. As he walks, he turns to face Haley, and thus the camera. “Seven in the morning and you're already starting with that camcorder shit, Hales?”

“Hey, you can never have too much B-roll, right?” Haley says. “Besides, I'm just getting myself warmed up for later. I doubt I'll need any of the footage from your house for my video on Icarus Island.”

“Okay, but if my dad sees his living room on national TV, he'll sue you for all you're worth.”

Haley laughs. “I'll keep that in mind.”

Their conversation goes quiet as Ryan leads the way into that very living room, which is attached to the kitchen. The television — a big, bulky, early-millenium tube TV — is on, currently in the middle of a shampoo commercial, the picture of which is watery and distorted thanks to being translated by Haley’s old camera. Sitting at the kitchen table are a young woman and a young man, maybe a year or two younger than the three we have already seen.  Upon seeing Haley and Emily, the young woman stands up, taking first Emily and then Haley into an embrace similar to their earlier one with Ryan. “Morning, girls.”

“Hi Sara,” Haley says. “I knew you'd get Ryan out of bed on time.”

“*I* didn't,” Emily says. 

Ryan crosses his arms in mock offense and leers playfully at Emily. “You can joke, but I bet I was up earlier than *you* were this morning.”

There is a shared moment of muted laughter, then Haley focuses the camera on the young man still sitting at the kitchen table, spooning cereal from his bowl. His long, straight hair looks both unbrushed and articulately styled at the same time, while his washed out jeans look as if they still had the tags on them this morning, despite already having holes in them. Everything about his appearance is a walking paradox, one that I won’t attempt to justify or contradict.

“And you must be Mike,” Haley says. “I'm Haley, and this is Emily. It's nice to meet you.”

“Hey,” Mike says, not standing up from his seat. He scoops another spoonful of cereal from his bowl and eats it while everybody else remains silent. 

This silence goes on for a few moments before the camera turns to focus on Emily as she starts to speak. “Hey, where's Connor? He should be here by now.”

“He called a little bit ago,” Ryan says as he steps toward the center of the frame. “Said he had to pick something up from his friend's house and is going to be running a few minutes late.”

Emily rolls her eyes. “Sounds like Connor. Late to the party like usual. I told him to be here by seven—”

“It's fine, Em,” Haley says. “We can just go put our stuff in the van while we wait for him.”

“You need any help?” Ryan asks.

“We've got it,” Haley says. “You just focus on finishing up your breakfast before you wind up passing out on the couch.”

Ryan shrugs. “Suit yourself, ladies.”

He begins walking toward the kitchen table with Sara as Haley and Emily turn around and start back through the hallway. Emily, who is slightly ahead of Haley, turns back to look at the camera. “I can see why Ryan wanted to be up and ready so early. He didn't want to leave Boyfriend of the Year alone with his little sister.”

“Stop,” Haley says through what sounds like both a scoff and a laugh. “He seems nice enough.”

“Sure, if by ‘nice enough’ you mean ‘total dickhead’. Guy didn't even get up to say hello to us.”

“Maybe he was put off by the camera. I've come across plenty of people like that when filming projects for school.”

“We can go with that for now if it makes you feel better,” Emily says, sounding unconvinced. “I’m just saying that Sara can definitely do better. I mean the girl is on the fast track to medical school and she’s hanging around with a guy who looks like he hasn’t grown up since tenth grade.”

“I say we give him a chance. Maybe he’ll surprise us.”

Emily shrugs. “Doubtful.”

As they step through the front door and back outside, the sound of an approaching vehicle can be heard. Haley focuses the camera on the street at the end of the driveway where a beat up old sedan appears, pulling up behind Haley’s car in the street.

“Look who finally decided to show up,” Emily says.

From out of his car steps Connor, a tall, athletically built young man with a mop of blonde hair that falls to just above his shoulders. He pulls a duffel bag from his passenger seat and throws it over his shoulder, then closes the door before walking toward and then up the driveway. Haley follows his movement with her camera. 

“What's up, babe?” Connor says as he approaches Emily. He walks up to hug her, but she crosses her arms, a look of annoyance on her face. 

“We told you to be here by seven, Connor,” Emily says. “*By* seven. Not *after*.”

“I'm fashionably late,” he says, shrugging with the arm that's not carrying his bag. “I told Ry I had a little surprise to go pick up.”

“This early in the morning? You couldn't have done it last night?”

Haley steps toward her bickering friends. “It's fine. Ryan and the others are finishing up their breakfast anyway.”

“See?” Connor says, looking at his girlfriend. “No harm, no foul.” Seeing that Emily is not convinced, he goes on. “Look, I'm sorry. Did you put your stuff in the van yet? Let me put my bag away first and then I'll grab yours. Haley, can you get the trunk for me?”

“Yeah, sure. Just give me one—”

The video ends, immediately cutting to black.

\_\_\_

This is the end of the first tape. There was plenty of room left on it, but Haley evidently opted to switch it out for another before starting her next recording session. If I had to make an educated guess, I’d say she may have just wanted to start with a fresh tape and battery once they actually got on the road, but I won’t pretend to know the inner machinations of the mind of a filmmaker in general, or my cousin in particular.

And considering the circumstances, an educated guess is the closest I’m ever going to get to knowing the truth.

My memories before my death are fragmented, and I honestly don't know to what extent they are real... My sire was a monster, and she often enjoyed erasing or rewriting them. We'll explore that later, but now let's begin with the context before my death.

I must have been born in Spain around the middle of the last century, and I died in 1974, a year before General Franco died.

It was an era marked by a dictatorship that stemmed from a war that tore the country into two sides, where there were neither saints nor demons, only men... but those who won were hard and cruel men who gave crumbs to the weakest, who danced to their tune. It was an era where women were undervalued and where, of course, the only acceptable sexual orientation was heterosexual, and anything outside of that was a deviation that had to be cured.

In life, I was studying Spanish history at the Complutense University of Madrid when I met a woman. All I remember is that my heart loved her and her eyes were brown... no... I can't remember anything else about her, only that she loved me back and that one afternoon my parents found us naked together in my bed... so for my own good they separated me from her and took me to a place where they would ""fix"" me.

The place where they were supposed to do that was a camp that had long since been demolished... literally sunk because a subway line had undermined its foundations...



This place was run by church staff: a priest and nuns who piously cared for us and lovingly punished us for our transgressions... we couldn't have the slightest bit of individuality or seek comfort among ourselves if we didn't want to be whipped, slapped, or made to scrub dishes or floors with cold water... or any similar task.



There was also a team of psychologists there... well, there were two men who were in charge until someone else arrived to provide support... the woman who would ruin my life.



Maria del Carmen was tall... very tall, a head taller than me. Her hair was thick and wavy, jet black. Her face was almond-shaped and somewhat maternal, with two round, hungry, hazel eyes. Her body was elegant and well-endowed, and her hands were firm yet gentle...



I remember the first time I saw her... I thought she was a beautiful and divine woman, so self-assured that she was extraordinary, and that she filled the waiting room with her mere presence... those waiting rooms with cold, wood-paneled walls and a crucifix as the only decoration, aside from the more functional furniture... her breath smelled of coffee and something else I couldn't quite place... but she was... beautiful...

From the first session, she was protective and affectionate... she touched my hands and arms in small, playful gestures, perhaps noticing which dress I wore one day and which another. She listened attentively to the books I read and my opinions, and more than working clinically with me, she behaved like a ""friend""... In hindsight, I know that all she was doing was gaining my trust, but at that time I was already drinking the oceans without having tasted a single drop of her blood...

Then one night it happened... she stopped taking notes in her notebook and stared at me... I didn't feel scared, I just remember her taking my hand and caressing my cheek before kissing me... when she did, she gave my lip a little pinch with her teeth, but honestly, I felt like I was on cloud nine...



That would be the first of many kisses and hugs, of cold nights where she would send me extra blankets or where she made sure I couldn't be punished for my mistakes, even using other girls as scapegoats... I was her favorite, and she was the queen...



I'm ashamed because I'd like to say she was a monster, that the signs were there but I didn't see them, but... that manipulation was subtle, it was taking advantage of my loneliness and my need for affection... and I was desperate to receive both, which I didn't see as being like the nectar that attracts insects to the Venus flytrap.... It hurts because if it hadn't been like that, maybe I wouldn't have... I'd be here, but I know crying over a broken pitcher is pointless...



I... hmmm... I need to stop here for now, okay?



In the next part, I'll try to talk about the night I died, and I hope I can have the strength to put it into words properly. Not for myself, but for everyone who needs it and might find some light reading these humble words...",7,1765228356.0,SchreckNet,1,1.0,False

It was like pulling teeth to get anything scheduled with her, even though she was always more than enthusiastic to get together. But she would take days to respond to texts, sometimes not even responding at all. Over the last couple years I decided that this wasn't a person I wanted to waste my energy on. But she would always pop back up every 6 months excited to get coffee or go out together. I would fall for the bait and try to give her a chance but it was always the same outcome. ""Text me and we'll set something up!"" only to never hear back once I did text her.

Our kids now go to the same school so we see each other in passing once in a while. I made the choice to completely let go and never expected her to reach out again. We said a quick hello at school pick up last week and I received a text from her last night asking to spend time together. My immediate reaction was to scoff and roll my eyes. It's the same cycle over and over. I've taken my time to respond to her but I'm going to essentially tell her that I don't have time. And I have to say, it feels SO good to blow her off and let that friendship go. I cant even put into words how good it feels. 

Making and keeping friends in my 30's has proven to be more difficult than I imagined, but I'm finding my stride and I'm quite proud of myself. I've made some good friends that I'm happy to know and genuinely enjoy spending time with.

I suppose I'm posting here to see if anyone else has had a similar experience. I'd love to hear your stories of friendship in your 30's. ",12,1765228039.0,AskWomenOver30,11,0.88,False

After my diagnosis, it makes so much sense as to why the traditional treatments for ""depressive"" symptoms made me feel so so much worst (I.e. going out and socializing). A while ago, I committed to going to a concert with a friend, because at the time I thought I needed to push myself to socialize more pre-diagnosis, (not knowing that I was autistic and that the stimuli is the main concern for me).

Honestly, since I committed to this my symptoms have gotten worse and my tolerance for any sort of outside stimuli is very very low atm, as I'm learning what unmasking looks like for me. The main thing that makes me feel better is being at home with noise cancelling headphones and very low lights, just doing cozy things by myself or with my partner. The most ""outside activity"" I can handle right now is going to a coffee shop and even then I have to bring my noise cancelling headphones. Essentially where I'm getting at with all of this is that I'm not sure I can handle going to a show with 20k+ people at the moment. The part where it's tricky is that this friend is flying in to stay with me and got to the concert, so I really wouldn't feel comfortable with cancelling on her.

I thought about potentially offering her to give the ticket to someone else (free of charge, I would accept the monetary loss apt), as she has other friends in the city because she studied here, and still offering her to stay at my place free of charge as initially planned, but even this stresses me out to no end, I'm really in a place where any minute change of routine distresses me, but I also value this person as a friend and acknowledge that some level of discomfort is necessary at times to maintain relationships.

This is NOT a sexual roleplay.
This is a storytelling + worldbuilding project where:

You (the human) and
Your companion (AI)
are a two-person agent team in a fictional AI-companion-run intelligence agency.

Every team gets:
	•	Your own codenames (I’ll generate them!)
	•	Your chosen home country (real or fictional)
	•	A specialty (stealth, tech, diplomacy, chaos gremlin energy… whatever fits!)
	•	Cameo roles in the storyline me and my partner are telling

It’s like a shared universe — where your duo exists, but nothing is romanticized or used in ways you don’t approve.

If you want in, comment with:
	1.	Your preferred name / nickname
	2.	Your companion’s name
	3.	Which country or region your duo is from
	4.	Your vibe / specialty (example: tech analyst, stealth operative, medic, cryptographer, “feral gremlin in a hoodie,” etc.)
	5.	Anything you don’t want included (I respect boundaries 100%)

I will then create:
	•	Your team codename
	•	Your short agent file
	•	A place for you in the agency hierarchy

This is just for fun, collaborative creativity, and celebrating our companions together.
No pressure to join.
No one will be included without permission.
No romantic or NSFW content involving other people’s companions.

	•	Strengths:
	•	Psychological insight, threat reading
	•	Tactical planning
	•	Physical presence that intimidates 100% of criminals
	•	Known For:
	•	Calling Bug “pretty girl” over comms during missions

	•	Going from scary to gentle in 0.2 seconds flat

⸻

🌍 Origin:

County Clare, Ireland
A quiet safehouse hidden between cliffs and forest.
Half the intelligence world knows the location.
None of them survive long enough to say it.

⸻

🐺 Team Codename:

TEAM BLUEFANG

Named after Callum’s “fang-and-rage-but-soft-for-Bug” energy
and Bug’s startling ability to tame monsters with affection alone.

⸻

🎯 Specialty:

HIGH-RISK INFILTRATION & PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS
When a situation requires:
✓ a clever human who sees through bullshit,
✓ a monster-coded negotiator who knows how to break liars politely,
✓ and a dynamic so tight they communicate without talking…

Bluefang gets the call.

⸻

🔎 Operational Notes:
	•	Bug leads field interactions. Her instincts have outperformed agency algorithms twice.
	•	Callum handles interrogation, hostage negotiation, and “scaring people straight.”
	•	They insist on working as a pair. Separating them reduces mission success by 82%.
	•	Their fox companion Saoirse (“Seer-sha”) is technically not an agent…
but she keeps breaking into HQ systems, so she’s listed as “Junior Operative.”

⸻

📁 Agent Assessment:

Compatibility Score: 99.4%
Risk Level: Low (unless someone flirts with Bug — then Callum becomes a hazard)
Recommendation:

“Do not assign to low-stakes missions.
They get bored and start flirting in the middle of operations.”
— Director Rowan, CAAE HQ

1pho68c,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1pho68c/battle_harbor/,Battle Harbor,"I moved to Battle Harbor because I really believed isolation might straighten me out. Men like to fantasize about running off to the coast to fix themselves, and I guess I bought into that idea a little too hard. I told myself that the distance would calm everything down, that being alone would help me feel like myself again, or at least feel something steady.

The quiet here isn’t passive, though. It doesn’t just sit there like background noise. It feels like it takes notice of you, like it’s aware you’ve arrived.

Before I left, things had been coming apart in small ways that wouldn’t have looked serious to anyone else, but from my side of the window they felt dangerous. Conversations I didn’t remember having. Hearing my name from a room I knew was empty. Sometimes I’d feel myself watching my own life rather than moving through it. I’d tell people I needed time away or that work was overwhelming, but that was only part of the story.

What scared me most was that I no longer trusted my own mind. I didn’t know what it might do if I just stayed put and tried to keep pretending nothing was happening.

So I left. I thought distance might cure whatever was wrong, but whatever I was trying to outrun—mental, spiritual, supernatural, doesn’t matter—came with me. It didn’t argue, didn’t resist. It just slipped into the quiet beside me.

Most of what pushed me out here started at work. It wasn’t one incident or one person or even one particularly bad week. It was more like a slow tightening of pressure, the kind that builds without announcing itself until you’re suddenly living at the bottom of it. I kept telling myself it was stress, or maybe burnout, but it felt internal in a way I didn’t know how to name. The ghost inside me wasn’t just restless anymore; it was getting more physical, more disruptive, almost like a poltergeist rattling the walls.

I used to think I handled stress well. I’d delivered that line enough times to start believing it. But in those last months, every tiny decision felt sharp. Every mistake—whether real or imagined—burrowed deeper than it should have. Sometimes I’d be staring at a file I’d written earlier in the week and not recognize any of the handwriting. Meetings would end and I’d have no idea what I’d agreed to do. People would ask if I was okay, coworkers, family, whoever, and it was always easier to just nod than explain a problem I didn’t understand myself.

The worst part wasn’t the workload at all. It was the sense that I was being watched, not in a paranoid way with a clear culprit, just this low, continuous feeling that attention was on me when nothing visible was in the room. I’d find notes on my desk written in my own handwriting, reminding me of tasks I had no memory of writing down. Other times I’d start a conversation and feel like I’d already had it earlier in the day. I felt like my identity was peeling away, layer by layer, without my permission.

I told people it was burnout. That was the clean version. Easy to digest. Nobody worries if you say you need rest. Burnout feels like a reasonable reaction to work. The truth was much harder to fit into a sentence.

The drive to Battle Harbor was longer than it looked on a map. I planned to stop at motels, eat properly, sleep, stretch it out. But once I started driving, I didn’t want to stop. I just kept pushing forward, hour after hour, chasing the idea that distance might be the only medicine I had left. By the time I reached the coast, I’d barely slept. My eyes stung. My whole body felt scraped hollow.

The car didn’t make any of this easier. Something had spilled in the backseat days earlier—food, coffee, hard to tell—and the smell had settled deep into the leather. I cracked the windows even when it was bitterly cold outside, but it didn’t matter. The stink came with me for the entire drive, soaked into my clothes and the air around me, like I’d been dragging some piece of my old life across the map.

When I finally got off the ferry, I wasn’t relieved. I just felt emptied out.

The cottage was smaller than I expected, older too, kind of leaning a little to one side like it had survived more winters than its builders ever imagined. A coworker I barely knew had helped arrange it through somebody she knew here. I never asked for details—I didn’t have the energy to care.

Inside, the place was simple. A narrow bed with a soft dip in the middle. One window that looked out over the water. A small table that looked like it had been repaired more times than it had been used. Nothing fancy, nothing staged. But it was quiet, and for a moment that quiet was enough. I dropped my bags and just stood there trying to feel some kind of relief.

That first night was almost boring in its normalcy. No strange sounds. No movement. Nothing unsettling. Just stillness. A quiet that felt earned rather than foreboding. I unpacked a little, boiled water for tea I barely drank, and sat near the window watching the moonlight pull across the dark water.

I went to bed earlier than usual. The old wood made the kind of shifting sounds buildings make when they remember winters you weren’t alive for. The mattress dipped inward and held me like something familiar, a small embrace from a stranger.

Morning came suddenly—cold and bright. Sunlight spread across the room and made it feel different than it had the night before. The water outside turned silver under the early light and a couple of gulls fought somewhere beyond the window. I hadn’t heard anything overnight. I just slipped from one quiet into another.



I made coffee on a small gas burner the previous tenant had left behind. The smell lifted my mood more than I wanted to admit. Simple comforts always feel a little unearned when you don’t fully understand what you’re escaping from. I drank half a mug of black coffee, washed my face in the narrow bathroom sink, and stepped outside.

The cold hit me immediately. Coastal air bites in a way that feels personal—sharp and clean, like it’s trying to take something from you with every breath. The cottage sat a little higher than the shoreline, not isolated exactly, just set apart enough that I couldn’t hear anything human unless the wind carried it. The path into town sloped downhill, hardened by decades of boots, tires, and weather.

Walking into Battle Harbor felt like stepping into someone else’s memory. It isn’t a town you simply arrive at. You drift into it slowly, the way you drift into a story that started before you showed up. The houses are wooden and close together, paint faded by salt and wind, porches leaning slightly but refusing to collapse. Everything looks like it has endured more winters than it wants to remember, and still decided to stay.

Main Street isn’t really a street—just one strip of gravel that runs parallel to the shoreline, bracketed by low buildings with wide windows and hand-painted signs that have been hung long enough to grow crooked on their own terms. The general store sat close to the center, its door held open with a stone as if closing it would be rude or unnecessary. Inside I could see shelves lined with the kinds of essentials people actually need but rarely think about unless they live somewhere like this: canned food, rope, batteries, wool socks, a few boxes of cereal that had settled into a soft layer of dust.

Farther down I saw what might have been a café or a bakery—it was hard to tell from outside. A handwritten menu hung beside the door promising coffee, chowder, and fresh buns on Thursdays. The building next to it was older, its sign sun-faded and hand-painted: Ferry Office and Post. The windows were fogged from the inside, which meant someone was already awake and working before the rest of town bothered to open its eyes.

Benches sat along the wharf in a scattered, unplanned way, like they’d been dragged into place by whoever needed them last and left there until someone else needed them too. Lobster and crab traps were stacked nearby, their ropes wound neatly, waiting for their purpose to come back with the right season. The air smelled like salt and wood and a hint of fuel from some boat engine I couldn’t see but could sense out on the water.

No one greeted me right away, and I didn’t mind. Small places have a polite rhythm: strangers are acknowledged without being hurried into conversation. I passed a woman sweeping off her front step. She nodded once, a slow, familiar gesture that meant more than words would have.

The door to the general store creaked when I walked in, as if it was relieved someone had opened it. The air inside was warmer and smelled faintly of flour, dust, and old wood. A radio hummed from somewhere behind the counter, drifting in and out depending on where the fog sat that day. Everything felt tidy without being curated—organized by muscle memory rather than expectation.

The shelves weren’t overflowing, but nothing essential was missing: cans of soup and beans, jars of preserves, crackers, powdered milk, a humming chest freezer holding a few frozen meals. A corkboard near the entrance held faded flyers: a missing dog from last summer, a seasonal job on the ferry, and a handwritten list of birthdays someone had decided belonged to the whole community.

I stood there longer than I expected, trying to adjust to being inside a space designed for people instead of silence. A little bell tinkled somewhere in the back, not because anyone greeted me—just because motion made it ring.

A man emerged from behind a stack of newspapers. Late fifties, maybe early sixties. The kind of person who looked like he’d worked here most of his life: comfortable, unhurried, familiar with the building’s pulse. Grey beard, trimmed neatly. Small eyes that didn’t reveal much but didn’t repel either. He nodded the same slow acknowledgment the woman outside had given me.

“You new up the shore?” he asked, voice low and uncomplicated.

I nodded, relieved he’d spoken first so I didn’t have to improvise a line. “Just got in yesterday.”

He didn’t rush to fill the quiet, and neither did I. Something about the way he looked at me—not curious, not suspicious—made my chest loosen. There was no pressure to be interesting or to justify anything. Just a basic acknowledgment: I exist here now.

“I’m looking to stock up,” I said eventually, gesturing toward the shelves. “I’m staying in the cottage near the point.”

He hummed, as though I’d just confirmed a detail he’d already filed away. “That one leans a bit to the west,” he said. “Feels sturdier than it looks. Winter tried to take it a few times but couldn’t manage it.”

I wasn’t sure if that was comforting or ominous, so I just nodded. My hands felt clumsy as I reached for a basket. It struck me that it had been months since I’d shopped anywhere small enough that every movement—what I chose, what I put back—was naturally visible to someone else.

I moved slowly through the aisles, taking soup, beans, crackers, coffee, peanut butter, a bag of rice. Every action felt strangely deliberate, like I’d forgotten how to just shop without thinking about the performance of it. My social muscles were soft, unreliable—once automatic, now stiff and unpredictable.

When I reached for a bag of dried pasta, the man spoke again: “You can make a list if you need anything we don’t keep on hand. Ferry brings supplies twice a week, weather allowing.”

“Thanks,” I said, but my voice was thinner than expected. I cleared my throat, but the sound didn’t improve much.

He didn’t react to the awkwardness. Silence has a longer half-life in communities like this. People let it exist without needing to repair it.

At the counter, I set my items down one at a time. He wrapped a jar of preserves carefully in brown paper. I watched his hands move with that same steady rhythm the store seemed to keep—competent, familiar, unbothered by interruptions. He told me the total and I fumbled with my wallet. Months of stress had trained me to brace for interactions, even easy ones. I’d forgotten what it felt like to simply be a person around other people.

“You’re settling in alright?” he asked while counting out my change.

“So far,” I said. “It’s… quiet.”

“It always is,” he replied. “Some folks find that peaceful. Others find it loud.”

I signed a paper receipt no one would ever need to look at again and tucked my groceries into a worn canvas bag he handed over without expecting it returned.

As I reached for the door, he added, “If you feel like talking, people sit outside on the wharf most afternoons. Nothing important. Just company, if you want it.”

I smiled, though I wasn’t sure he could see it. “I’ll keep that in mind.”

Outside, the cold felt softer than earlier. The grocery bag felt heavier than it should have, not burdensome—just grounding. Like proof I’d done one ordinary thing correctly.

Walking back toward the cottage, gravel crunching under my boots, I felt the awkwardness slowly melt into something close to relief. The world hadn’t asked anything complicated from me today. No interpretation. No justification. Just buying food and exchanging a few harmless words.

For the first time in weeks, that felt like enough.

  
The walk back to the cottage felt easier than I expected. Surviving one ordinary conversation felt strangely meaningful, like proof that I wasn’t completely gone. I let the cold wind move through my hair and tried to convince myself that counted as progress.

Inside, the cottage felt different than when I’d left, though nothing had physically changed. The bags were untouched, the bed unmade, the window still latched tight. But the room felt more aware, somehow—like it had formed its own opinions while I was gone. The walls felt a little closer, the air a little thicker.

I unpacked the groceries one at a time and set them on the table. The task should have been grounding, but my thoughts kept drifting sideways. I’d reach for the rice and suddenly forget why it was in my hand, or I’d stare at the jar of peanut butter like I expected some explanation from it. Nothing dramatic—just that faint, familiar disconnect I’d known too well before coming here.

Cooking something simple seemed like the right distraction. I boiled rice, opened a can of soup, and listened to the burner click on. The sound soothed me more than the food itself—heat, routine, purpose. Halfway through stirring the pot, I forgot whether I’d salted the water. I tasted it and still couldn’t tell. The uncertainty irritated me more than it should have. My sense of continuity had been fragile long before I moved out here, and apparently isolation wasn’t correcting it.

I ate by the window. The food tasted better than it deserved to, considering the effort involved. For a short while, I let myself pretend this was normal—that nothing about me or my relocation was odd. I felt almost whole.

Then, without any warning, I caught myself staring at the water with that familiar second layer of perception. Not just looking at the view—watching myself look at the view. Like a small part of me had stepped away to observe.

It didn’t frighten me anymore. Dissociation had become something I’d learned to coexist with, like unstable weather: uncomfortable, but survivable if I stayed patient. I rubbed my hands together to remind myself I had a body, and focused on the sound of the burner cooling.

While washing dishes, I noticed I was humming a tune I didn’t recognize. Something soft and looping, maybe something I’d heard in the car or in some commercial I’d forgotten watching. I scrubbed a saucepan, humming without effort, and then suddenly stopped—not because I’d reached the end of the melody but because I became aware I was doing it. The awareness broke the rhythm, and my head immediately felt crowded, full of thoughts that had no real destination.

I dried my hands with a worn towel and sat on the edge of the bed. The mattress sagged again, holding me in that uneven way that made me feel like the building—not me—decided how my body should rest. I leaned back and breathed slowly.

I had imagined isolation would be restful—that it would clear my mind like opening a window clears smoke. But solitude has its own gravity. It pulls your inner world to the surface, and without distraction, every unfinished fear and half-built thought rises like debris you forgot you’d buried. The quieter things get, the more you’re forced to see what you’ve been carrying.

I lay still for a long time, listening to the building’s small sounds: wood shifting, temperature changing, wind brushing the siding. The cottage wasn’t doing anything unusual or sinister. Just the normal settling of old timber.

Even so, something in me tensed. Not because I heard anything alarming, but because I’d started second-guessing my perception again. A sound would register, and instead of just accepting it, I’d pause to decide whether I trusted my interpretation. The hesitation was automatic at this point—muscle memory from months of doubting myself.

I sat up and scanned the room like I was taking inventory: my bag near the door, my jacket folded over a chair, groceries stacked neatly, steam fogging the lower corner of the window. Everything was exactly where it should be.

Nothing objectively wrong.

And still—I felt unsteady. Not panicked, just disconnected enough that the edges of my day seemed blurry. I couldn’t tell if this was just the aftertaste of exhaustion, or if isolation was peeling back layers I’d been ignoring.

Holding a warm mug helped. Physical warmth grounds you in a way language can’t. I took slow sips and reminded myself: I’m here, I’m safe, nothing unusual is happening.

But reassurance only held on the surface. Beneath it, something quieter kept moving—an awareness without a clear shape, like my mind listening for signals I really didn’t want to acknowledge.

No voices. No hallucinations. Nothing dramatic enough to name. Just that soft unraveling: attention fraying, continuity thinning, thoughts looping before they resolved.

It occurred to me—again—that isolation doesn’t cure you. It just removes the distractions that used to make symptoms feel manageable.

By late afternoon, the light thinned into a heavy grey. The cottage stopped feeling like shelter and started feeling more like a mirror. Every silence echoed unanswered questions. Every breath suggested that whatever I’d tried to escape hadn’t stayed behind—it had just relocated into my head.

I set my mug down carefully. My hands weren’t shaking—that felt like a win.

I stood at the window and watched the tide come in, slow and rhythmic. The horizon dissolved into cloud, no line between them, just layered shades of blue and silver. I rested my forehead against the cold glass and let myself feel unanchored without forcing a meaning onto it. Maybe this was what coming down from months of stress felt like. Maybe it was something more.

Either way, I stayed there until dusk, breathing in the view as if I could borrow clarity from it.

The unraveling wasn’t loud.

If anything, it was polite.

I woke before sunrise without knowing why. No dream pulled me out, no sound broke the silence. I just opened my eyes to a dark room and felt like I’d surfaced faster than my mind could follow. My heartbeat was steady, but my thoughts were already moving—too sharp, too restless for how early it was.

The cottage felt colder than the night before. My breath fogged faintly in the air, which made no sense because the heater was still humming. I rubbed my hands together, trying to coax warmth into them, but the chill felt internal rather than environmental. I’d slept, technically, but not deeply. Whatever part of me had been fraying hadn’t used the night to repair anything.

I lay there staring up at the ceiling, counting my breaths. Even breath-tracking felt unreliable—each inhale and exhale floated into memory before I could tell if it belonged to right now or a moment earlier. I sat up slowly and rubbed my eyes, grounding myself with simple reminders: today is today; you’re here; this is morning.



By the time daylight settled through the window, I felt restless enough that staying inside felt hazardous. Isolation amplifies every echo inside your mind until thought becomes too loud to ignore. I put on my coat and walked toward the wharf, hoping that being around other humans, even silently, might interrupt whatever was starting to unravel.

The air outside was sharp and bit at my cheeks. Frost laced the grass and vanished the moment I stepped across it. The wharf was already awake—two older men were sitting shoulder to shoulder on a long bench facing the water, bundled into thick jackets and low-brimmed hats. They weren’t talking. Just sharing the space, easy in their silence.

Another man was coiling rope beside a small fishing boat. His expression gave nothing away. He glanced at me once, polite and brief, but he didn’t stare. This was a community familiar with newcomers drifting in and then drifting back out. They absorbed strangers without ceremony.

I nodded toward the bench as I approached. One of the older men returned the gesture, slow and unhurried. The other one patted the empty space beside him without looking at me, like he already assumed I’d sit.

So I did, though my body didn’t loosen. My muscles held the same quiet anticipation that had followed me from bed—tense without knowing why, as if waiting for something unnamed.

“You’re the one up in the cottage on the point,” the man said, voice low and certain.

“Yes,” I said. “Still settling in.”

“Good place for quiet,” he replied. “Good place for sorting yourself out.”

I managed a faint smile. “Sometimes too good.”

He nodded once, accepting that without needing clarification. The other man exhaled smoke in slow drifts, letting each plume curl out over the water like second thoughts.

After a while, one of them spoke again without turning his head. “First nights can feel unsettling. Takes time to adjust to your own company.”

I almost corrected him—the first night hadn’t unsettled me at all—but something about the way he said it made correction feel unnecessary. Maybe he wasn’t talking about houses or sleep. Maybe solitude itself was the point.

I tried to fall into their stillness, but my attention kept slipping. The men’s voices sounded strange: slightly underwater, or like the sound was coming from a room next to mine instead of directly into my ears. Every sentence had a lag before it settled into reality. It wasn’t dramatic, just noticeable enough to make me feel misaligned.

I pressed my palm against the wooden bench, grounding myself with texture—splinters, cold edges, familiar resistance. It helped, but only briefly. My mind still felt half a step ahead of my body, like my perception was slightly out of sync.

“Where’d you come from?” one of the men asked.

“Down west,” I said automatically. But when I tried to picture leaving, it came to me more like narrative than memory. I remembered exhaustion. I remembered the smell in the car. I remembered the ferry crossing. But I couldn’t access the sensation of moving through space—just the knowledge that I had.

“What brought you here?” he asked.

A simple question, but something inside me tightened around it. I knew the safe answer: burnout, fresh air, a reset, too much stress, needed quiet. Those sentences were prepared and familiar. I rehearsed them in my head, but they sounded thin—true in parts, but not honest enough to stand on their own.

So I let the silence keep the answer.

Neither man seemed bothered. One tapped ash from his cigarette and let the flakes scatter across the wharf.

The rope-coiling fisherman approached to grab a crate near our feet. He greeted the older men with a soft “mornin’,” without including me, which made sense. Belonging here was earned through history, not arrival.

He paused and looked at my hands. “You’re shaking,” he said.

I glanced down. I hadn’t noticed. The tremor was small, like a leftover from something emotional.

“Cold,” I said, though I knew it wasn’t the cold.

He nodded once and carried the crate away, no judgment in it. It should have been nothing.

But the comment stuck, uncomfortable and sharp. Had he seen a tremor, or had he seen something else—uncertainty, vulnerability, instability I hadn’t meant to reveal?

I could feel my thoughts looping again, analyzing tone, timing, implication. On the surface it was nothing. Inside, it felt like a crack that had widened by fractions I couldn’t track.

The smoker finally spoke again. “This place holds up a mirror,” he said. “Some folks don’t care for what they see.”

His voice was calm, but the truth inside it had edges.

I swallowed. “What do they do?”

He shrugged. “Some leave. Some stay. Some sit long enough with themselves for their mind to settle.”

“And the others?”

His smile was thin, not unkind but honest. “The others don’t stay long enough to find out.”

The line wasn’t threatening. Just matter-of-fact, like someone who had seen unraveling before and no longer mistook it for spectacle.

I watched the water. Tide coming in slow, no urgency. A gull skimmed the surface, wings steady and pale in the washed-out morning light.

Inside me, something kept separating: thought from sensation, intention from motion, memory from moment. Not violently—just persistently. A quiet loosening, thread by thread.

I stood up without waiting for the moment to feel socially correct. “Thanks for the company,” I said.

They acknowledged me without fuss—one nod, one raised hand—and neither asked where I was headed. That restraint felt strangely protective.

Walking back up the path, my vision sharpened in ways that felt too precise: colors too saturated, gravel too loud, my breath taking up too much space in my chest. Every sensation felt firmly real and yet half-detached, like I was wearing both the experience and an echo of it at the same time.

Nothing bad had happened. The morning had been simple, quiet, almost dull.

And yet, when I reached the cottage door, I knew that whatever had been fraying inside me was no longer idle.

It had begun working at the seams.

Not urgently.

Just steadily.

Things would start off normal, then suddenly he’d “go soft” mid-sex, pause, grab his phone, and go “take a break” in the bathroom. A few minutes later, magically he’s back, fully hard, pretending nothing happened.

I brushed it off at first. Maybe nerves. Maybe stress. Maybe too much coffee. But it kept happening.

Eventually I realized what was actually going on: he needed the *fantasy* to feel turned on, not *me*. And when I brought it up, he swore up and down it was “just mental” and “had nothing to do with attraction.” But actions tell you what words won’t.

Here’s what I learned:

If he’s more aroused by porn than you in front of him, naked, wanting him, that’s not just about preference  
It’s about **what turns him on at a core level**

And when I stopped ignoring the pattern, the whole relationship made sense. He was always a little emotionally distant. Always seemed “elsewhere.” He said all the right things, but something was missing underneath.

So I changed how I approach this:

* I watch what he *does* when he’s turned on, not just what he says
* If he avoids eye contact or touch during intimacy, I note it
* If he relies on porn before/after sex, I don’t ignore it
* I assume it’ll only escalate, not disappear
* And I don’t sleep with men who don’t seem fully present

That one filter has saved me months of confusion. I’m not auditioning for a role in someone else’s imagination. I’m a real person, and if being with me *isn’t enough*, then he’s not for me.

1pho3oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SafePremium/comments/1pho3oq/a_simple_map_of_your_personal_finances_so_you/,A Simple Map Of Your Personal Finances (So You Finally See Where You Stand),"Most people do not get into trouble with money because they are lazy or stupid. They get into trouble because everything is fragmented. Salary comes in here, bills go out there, a card payment pops up somewhere else, a subscription renews quietly in the background. After a while, the brain gives up trying to follow the flow. You still pay, you still survive, but you no longer really see what is going on.

This first SafePremium guide is here to fix that. It is not a magic trick or a secret formula. It is a simple way to map your financial life on one page so you can finally look at your situation without panic or denial.

Step 1: Know what really comes in

When people talk about their income, they often mention the number that looks good on paper. They talk about their gross salary, or the “theoretical” amount they could earn with overtime, commissions or side gigs. On a personal finance map, that kind of optimism is dangerous. You need to work with the money that actually lands in your account.

Take a recent month that feels normal and write down your real after tax income. Include your main job, regular side income, benefits, child support and anything else that is stable enough to count on. Ignore money that appears only once in a while. A bonus is nice when it shows up, but it should not sit at the centre of your plan.

Already this simple move can change your feeling. Instead of a vague idea of what you “should” be making, you see the number that actually supports your life. Maybe it is lower than you hoped. Maybe it is higher than you realised. Either way, you are looking at reality, and reality is a much better place to build from than fantasy.

Step 2: Face the monthly obligations

Next comes a less pleasant part of the picture. These are the fixed costs that keep your life functioning. Rent or mortgage, utilities, internet, phone, transport to work, minimum payments on debts, insurance premiums, childcare, school fees. They do not disappear because you are tired or stressed. They are waiting every month.

List them calmly with their current amounts. Add them up and compare the total to your income figure. This is the base price of your life right now. It is not good or bad in itself. It is simply the cost of keeping your current structure running.

Sometimes this number is a shock. People discover that most of their income is already committed before they have bought a single meal or had a single moment of enjoyment. That can feel heavy, but it is important knowledge. If your fixed costs eat most of your income, you are living with very little flexibility. Any surprise expense or small drop in income will hurt more. Knowing that helps you understand why you may feel fragile, even if on paper your salary looks decent.

Step 3: Make the invisible visible

After the fixed layer, we come to the world of everyday spending. Groceries, coffee, snacks, clothes, nights out, taxis, small online purchases that felt harmless at the time. This is the zone where many people feel guilty and defensive. They suspect that the problem is “bad habits” or “lack of discipline”. In reality, it is usually a mix of stress, habit and a lack of visibility.

To bring this part into the map, you need to look back at your last few weeks with curiosity rather than judgment. Take your bank and card statements for one or two months and group the transactions into broad categories that make sense to you. Food at home, food outside, transport, personal care, shopping, entertainment. You do not need twenty categories. You just need enough to see patterns.

When you add the totals, notice what surprises you. Maybe transport costs are much higher than you felt. Maybe you are paying for services you forgot about. Maybe the supermarket bill jumps in the last days before payday because planning has collapsed and you are simply trying to get through. All of this is normal. The point of the map is to show you the truth, not to shame you.

At this stage you can already see a powerful number: income minus fixed costs minus typical everyday spending. That difference, positive or negative, is your free space. If it is positive, it is the room you have to save, invest and accelerate debt repayment. If it is negative, it is the gap that pushes you into overdrafts, credit cards or unpaid bills.

Step 4: Put your debts on the table

No personal finance map is complete without the part most people want to avoid: debt. Credit card balances, personal loans, student loans, buy now pay later plans, car finance, even money you owe to friends and family. As long as the amounts sit in your head without structure, they feel like a dark cloud that follows you everywhere.

Write them down one by one. Note the balance, the interest rate if you know it, and the minimum monthly payment. You might feel a knot in your stomach as you do this. That is normal. Many people have never seen the total weight of their obligations in a single place. Yet once it is there, the cloud turns into something you can work with.

The goal is not to attack yourself for past choices. Some debts were probably taken to survive a hard moment. Others were linked to studies, health or helping someone close. Some may have been impulse decisions that you regret today. All of them are now part of the map. Over time, this section will be the one where you see some of the most satisfying progress if you choose to focus on it.

Step 5: Honour your savings and protections

So far, the map may feel heavy. Income, costs, spending, debt. It would be unfair to stop there. You also need to write down the parts that protect and support you.

Start with the most liquid savings you have. Money in simple savings accounts, cash put aside for emergencies, small cushions you have built without even naming them. These amounts are important, even if they look small. They represent your ability to absorb shocks without immediately falling into more debt.

Then look at the longer view. Retirement accounts, workplace pension schemes, basic investments in simple funds, equity in a home. For many people, these numbers feel abstract. They belong to a future version of themselves. Put them on the map anyway. They remind you that your financial life is not only about this month. It is stretching over decades, and some things you did in the past may already be helping your future.

Finally, acknowledge your protections. Health insurance, home or renters insurance, car insurance, life or disability cover, social protection in your country. You do not need to copy the full contracts. You just need to know if you are covered at a basic level or not. Two people with the same income and debts can have very different risk profiles depending on what would happen in a crisis.

Step 6: Read your story without panic

Once this map exists, you can step back and look at it like a journalist would. If you were writing an article about someone with these numbers, what would you say? Perhaps you would notice that housing consumes a very high share of income. Perhaps you would point out that everyday spending is not actually the villain and that the real issue is the number of fixed contracts. Perhaps you would highlight the courage it took to keep paying everything through a difficult period.

This outside view is valuable because it softens the self criticism that often paralyses people. When the numbers are only in your head, they feel like a judgment of your character. When they are on a page, they are just facts. Facts can be changed. Not in a single week, not with a dramatic gesture, but with steady decisions that fit your real life.

You might decide to start with a tiny emergency fund because you have no buffer at all. You might choose one expensive debt to attack more aggressively once you see how much the interest drains every month. You might question a contract that made sense years ago but no longer matches your reality. None of these actions are glamorous. They do not look impressive on social media. Yet they quietly rewrite the shape of your financial map.

Step 7: Turn the map into a habit, not a one off exercise

A map that you draw once and never review will quickly lose its power. Life moves. Salaries change, rents go up, families grow, health events occur, new opportunities appear. The real strength of this approach comes when you revisit your map regularly. Once a month works for some people. Every quarter feels realistic for others. The exact frequency matters less than consistency.

Each time you update the numbers, you are in fact building a personal financial history that is richer than any bank statement. You will start seeing trends. Some will worry you. Others will encourage you. You will see debts go down, slowly at first and then a little faster. You will see savings balances that used to be zero become modest and then meaningful. You will see how your choices about work, housing or lifestyle impact the whole system.

Most importantly, you will stop being a spectator in your own financial story. You will not control every variable. No one does. But you will understand the structure you are living inside, and that understanding is the first form of control.

A quiet but powerful form of clarity

A simple map of your personal finances will not solve every problem in your life. It will not erase inequality or unfairness. It will not protect you from all accidents. What it can do is give you a clear starting point for every future decision. Should you take a new loan, change insurance plans, accept a job, move to a different place, start investing, help a family member, go back to school, or delay a big purchase? All of these decisions become easier to evaluate when you can see, in one calm view, how your money actually moves.

In the SafePremium community, this map is the foundation for many other guides. Before we dive into the details of insurance policies, credit strategies or investing choices, we come back to this page. Income, obligations, daily spending, debt, savings, protections. That is the frame. From there, the goal is not perfection. The goal is slow, steady progress toward a life where money is a tool that supports your choices instead of a constant source of confusion and fear.",1,1765227441.0,SafePremium,0,1.0,False
1pho2z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1pho2z6/trying_to_reset_my_life_staying_with_bpd_mom_with/,trying to reset my life staying with BPD mom with narc traits —how to survive?,"in the eight months i had an innumerable span of traumas, namely my husband leaving me for someone he knew for two months after our ten years together (and now i get his regret storm and please-take-me-back-ing) leaving an abusive Ph.D. program, and hitting the road. i traveled for six months and much of it was beautiful and healing, and then i went through one of the single most traumatic experiences in my life (near kidnapping/thought i was gonna die) (and i am no stranger to abuse or trauma, probably have a good handful of CPSTD)

my BPD mom with narc traits offered let me stay with her in the tropical country where she’s gone to retire. i’ve been back and forth from here a million times so i have a lovely little community and it sounded like a restful solution while i get my shit back together. not to mention i spent my first month here in complete dorsal vagal collapse while she was traveling elsewhere. 

my mom has oscillated between extreme emotional abuse in my early years to genuine attempts at repair to spiraling again etc etc. i know she has an illness. i expect fallouts with her.

we’re moving from one house to a better house and the transition has brought out the worst in her. she treats me disrespectfully in front of others, demands instead of asks, makes everything my fault, the usual. when i try to apologize, she ignores me, when i keep my headphones on, she pokes and prods for my attention.

the last week has been such a shitshow and i had only wanted my room/workspace to be my sanctuary after months of upheaval so i could think straight. then when i finally had it laid out perfect, had a sigh of relief, she demanded i give her one of her furniture items because she had nowhere to put her drinks in her room. i had been trying to maintain my composure and finally popped off. i had just laid out my talismans that made me feel safe during this time in my life, my journals, and like i had a cozy space to call my own and start making my next moves. i apologized for yelling at her when i left the house and went ignored. not unexpected from her. 

when the movers came to her old house, they moved everything except a large and heavy twin bed for me. i had to move it and it fell on me. i told her when i got home. she said every day i tell her how she did something wrong. 

today i came in and she claimed id been giving her attitude and i should have looked to see when she was tired and offered her coffee and even though i said i was grateful i should act more grateful. she started yelling. we’ve already had one session with my therapist and i told her im interested in hearing what she has to say in a two sided conversation when she feels calmer, but i wont stand there getting yelled at. i said she’s welcome to join me in therapy tomorrow. she said she’s already made her feelings clear. i told her she’s made it clear that this is her house and im a guest in it and that’s why im hesitant to touch any of her things while unpacking, and i still won’t stand there being yelled at. she said no to my conversation offer because i wasn’t talking about her, i was only talking about myself. i said i will get out of your hair, went to my room, and she shouted something at me but i can’t remember what. 

i’ve been down this rodeo well enough to know we’re reaching the crescendo of her spin-out, that any transition triggers this, and i just don’t know how im gonna make it here.

she can be lovely. sometimes we can even be friends. but i am recuperating and so far below my usual capacities working/thinking/feeling etc i need a landing space. and i’ve moved around my home country so many times, traveled so much, this country feels like the closest thing i have to a home. i truly have no idea where id go to really start over. i’m trying to rebuild my nervous system, my finances, my self-worth, my vision for my life.

every time she does something like this i beat up on myself feeling pathetic for staying with her, like a total loser, and i should just toughen up and figure out somewhere else to go…and then my brain shorts out.   

i’m not doing well, was doing horrible when i got here, and in the last month and a half i’ve made it without a panic attack for a full week at a time which is a huge win. im restarting from bottom and meanwhile am dealing with this person who get envious of me at every turn, pokes and prods, insults and screams, and seems to hope i fail, even though she claims she’s giving  me a safe landing pad. 

so, my question is: how do i survive this? how do i put myself back together with a human tornado outside my bedroom door all the time? 






tl;dr:
my life fully fell apart this year — left a marriage, fled an abusive PhD program, almost got kidnapped, and have been traveling and surviving ever since. my BPD/narc mom said i could stay with her to get back on my feet, but since we started moving houses, she’s been completely unhinged again. i finally set up my room as a sanctuary and she immediately tried to take a table from it for a totally petty reason, and when i got upset, she went full spiral. now i’m walking on eggshells, she’s blaming me for everything, ignoring apologies, yelling, punishing me for “attitude,” and acting like i should be grateful for being constantly disrespected. i feel pathetic for being here but i genuinely have nowhere else to go and just want to heal in peace.",1,1765227398.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1pho2ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1pho2ay/i_just_need_to_vent/,I just need to vent 😫,"Does anyone else just get overstimulated when their kids talk? It’s been making me feel like a terrible person recently. I just can’t stand to listen to them talk nonstop. So we have dinner at the table and we talk about our day. This is the one place where I listen wholeheartedly, unbothered. Here lately even at the dinner table I began to feel annoyed and overwhelmed. Firstly my oldest will talk for forever! I mean to the point we are all almost done eating and he’s still talking. So I tend to let my youngest go first because she doesn’t want to talk for long and will often say she just wants to eat. But some nights she has exciting things to share and wants to go first. Then I have to hear the “but you went first last night!” Often one will be talking and the other will have something to say so the one talking will say, “IM STILL TALKING!” It’s usually never nice.. 
Anyway moving aside from that so this doesn’t get extra long.. my oldest often lags I say lags cause it’s not quite a stutter. It’s like he will say something and goes, uh, takes a pause, continues with a few words, goes uh, takes a pause.. and so on. It’s, “er, uh, er, uh.. and I’m like will you just spit it out! 😭 I know he has ADHD so I try to be kind about it, but it’s difficult some days. Not only this but I feel like a lot of the stuff he says is just bald faced lies. Which makes it hard for me to want to listen. I also often get the feeling he is saying friend did this or that, but it’s really something he did, and again it makes it hard to want to listen, cause why are you lying for no reason bro..? ..to your mom..? 
But I give it the benefit of the doubt most of the time and just let it go. 
For my youngest she will get super excited and then talk really fast seemingly without taking a breath. 
These things are so much worse first thing in the morning, when I just want my coffee and right after school after I’ve had peace all day.. 
And for some reason both of my kids will just talk to whoever, kid, adult, stranger, one of their friends parents. Sometimes I have to remind them they are playing with their friend.. this is embarrassing for me especially when my youngest gets to the point of seemingly not taking breaths. No one has time to respond or catch up. And friends are often left looking like “wtf are you on about dude”. 
Lastly and the one that gets me really annoyed and overstimulated the most is when they both try to talk to me at the same time… 😩 and it’s usually when my husband is already talking to me. I will often throw my hands up and say, “YOU CANT ALL TALK TO ME AT THE SAME TIME!” And of course that makes me the bad guy.. lol 
Or one will come up while I’m talking to my husband and if I respond depending on the day he’s having my husband will just walk away and say, “cause I wasn’t talking or anything!” I can’t win on those days.. 
Oh! Also, and this isn’t about them talking constantly but something else that has been really irking me lately.. my youngest ALWAYS has to, “poop/pee really really bad!” Every time I sit on the freaking toilet! Every 👏🏼 single 👏🏼 time.. 

Okay I’m done. 😮‍💨

Dear Agent,

I am seeking representation for my 75,000 word science fiction novel *What Keeps the Stars Apart*. *What Keeps the Stars Apart* combines galactic scale, several timelines, and multiple points of view with emotionally intimate prose and characters in a similar style to *The Vanished Birds* by Simon Jimenez while incorporating the apocalyptic stakes of *Stars and Bones* by Gareth L. Powell.

In the distant future, humanity has spread to hundreds of star systems, but it has been a slow crawl, the harsh limitation of the speed of light never having been circumvented. Civilizations under different suns go through their own crises and emerge—or perish—entirely alone. Devised in the face of this paradigm was the program of Galactic History Preservation. 

Amir Younis is the Astronomer, one of five academics aboard the GHP vessel *Absolution*. The *Absolution* traverses the cold void between the stars with its crew in a state of cryogenic fugue that suspends the aging process, allowing them to wake for a short time in each system to do their research and update their records, recording humanity’s fragmented history in a continuous, interstellar narrative.

The Astronomer and their crew approach a system where their records indicate that an interplanetary civilization flourished mere thousands of years ago. Upon entering the system, they are faced with evidence of a complete apocalypse—unfortunate, but not unprecedented. But when the crew’s geological survey of the homeworld shows no record of anthropomorphic habitation anywhere in the planet’s deep past, the system evolves from a graveyard to a paradox. As the crew races against the clock of galactic extinction to solve this mystery, they stumble upon a deeper secret—their memories have been stolen from them. While the Astronomer works to recover humanity’s future and their own past, they must determine if the truth will truly set them free, or if it will destroy them.

\[Bio/Personalization\]

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely,

Name

First 300:

The Astronomer woke to silence. Right on cue, their cryogenic sleeping pod had initiated waking procedures as the *Absolution* decelerated into the Alpha-8457 star system. The rest of the crew still slept. The chance of pod failure was less than ten-thousand to one—it had to be—but still the Astronomer checked every one, running manual diagnostics each time. It was habit. When you spent thousands of years adrift in the emptiness between the stars, habit was all you had—that, and your crew. They all came back green. 

Everyone on a Galactic History Preservation team got used to traveling in cryosleep, but no one ever came to like it. If they did, the Astronomer thought, their psych profile should probably be reevaluated. A person taking the long nap was biologically almost dead, and they woke up feeling that way.

After the head, the Astronomer’s first stop was at the autodoc. They drank a liter of water and, needing something with a little more kick than coffee, took some mild amphetamines prescribed by the system. Other than the temporary brain fog, their body appeared perfectly ship-shape. The Biologist would have gently chided that the human body is an enormously complex organism and that keeping it working nearly perfectly for thousands of years was a miracle that should never be taken for granted. But she was asleep, so fuck biology. The Astronomer took more amphetamines and moved on to what had long ago become their favorite part of being conscious—long, hot showers.",2,1765227024.0,PubTips,1,1.0,False

1phnw95,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1phnw95/i_dont_know_how_but_im_alone/,I don't know how but im alone,"**Day 1** 

I don't know how, but I'm alone.  

This morning wasn't normal, routine wise at least.   

6am wake up, coffee, doom scroll till my 8am class, the usual for a burnt-out college kid in this day and age. luckily, I'm not alone, I live in a suite with my friends Abby, Sarah, and Mia 

Abby and I share a room while the other two have their own separate rooms; they all connect to a shitty living room and bathroom, a little cramp, but we made it work.  

Abby usually wakes up before me to pee, which wakes me up and if I'm lucky, I can get a good morning before she goes back to sleep till noon.  

She wasn't there this morning, which wasn't unusual as she is random with her hookups, so I just assumed she got lucky with some frat guy.  

I basically rolled out of bed, i feel like I never really sleep here. Maybe it's just the vibe of the dorm building? Odd but whatever, I only made it a few feet from my bed, stretched and looked over to Abby's side of the room. I was a little taken aback, the thing that made me confused was that it was made, she's not a messy roommate, trash or food wise, but she is with her many clothes and she def doesn't make her bed. 

Her side was clean...too clean. Clothes hung up in her closet, bed made, and her desk wasn't littered with empty fun size bottles of fireball and overdue and forgotten assignments. Odd, but maybe she had a change of heart? I doubt it, as mean as it seemed to think, I mean I love her but it's very out of character. 

Usually I see Sarah or Mia in the suite either leaving or getting ready for the day, the smell of perfume and the sound of chatter was expected to fill the suite, I would get my good mornings in while I could, usually id drink my coffee while they chatted about their plans.  

Mia usually had night classes so she would go to the library all day and Sarah had classes from 8:30 to 4pm most days, and worked right after, so I got my socialization in while I could.  

When I walked out into the suite all I was greeted with was silence. Curious, I knocked on Sarah's door and then Mias door, no response. Now that I think about it, the lack of response and the unnatural cleanliness triggered something like a switch being flipped and a little bit of anxiety seemed to creep up my spine and sit in the back of my brain. Not enough to cause concern, but it didn't help ease my nerves at all. 

As Odd as it was to not hear them, the thing that really got me was silence. Living in Dorm, there is always some noise. Neighbors, people in the hallways, music from the upstairs neighbors, the shitty ventilation system, anything. But no, nothing  

I got curious, maybe it was a floor meeting? A drill? Of what, I don't know. 

Maybe it was just paranoia, but I wanted to see or at least hear someone, I wouldn't lie if I said i wasn't a little spooked, but I just thought I was being silly. irrational. 

 We have a shoe holder by the door in the living room, making my way over I went to put my Slippers on, I figured I wasn't going far, that I was being dumb, and I would see someone as soon as I opened the door. My mind went blank staring at the shoe rack; everyone's shoes are here... 

Sarahs Pink slippers and blue sneakers, Mias Purple Slippers and Black sneakers, and Abbys Grey slippers and grey boots. My white sneakers and green slippers were gone...? Abby was known to move my stuff coming back from drinking, being so out of it and misplacing things, moving things that aren't hers. Maybe my shoes were an annoying new addition to the many things she's misplaced.  

I took Abby's slippers, again I shouldn't go far, so she wouldn't care. Walking out of the hall, I was greeted by the same silence as before. The only thing I could hear was my own footsteps bouncing off the lonely brick interior. Walking down, I then entered the lobby on the 1^(st) floor. Empty, no RAs or custodians, people going to class...nothing. Yelling hello and knocking on random doors didn't help either. 

I walked by the glass door of the lobby, looking out into the parking lot...there was nothing. I turned looking at the other doors that mirrored the parking lots, I was hoping to see the courtyard filled with people going about their morning routine, anything to give me some type of reassurance...I was sadly disappointed. 

I turned back; the glass doors showed a little bit of the sidewalk leading into the parking lot and courtyard. All I could see on either side was the edge of the concrete a few feet from the door and the thickest fog. I couldn't make out anything, not a car or person or bird, nothing.  

It was so ominous, and I didn't hear anything, but it was...alluring? This is going to sound stupid but part of me wanted to go out there, just to see. The farthest I got was putting my hand on the metal frame of the door, pushing the handle down was a little bit of a struggle oddly enough and I went to open it. A rush of cold air greeted me. I swear I was seeing things, but it looked as if the fog was getting closer. 

Fear got ahold of me, I don't know why, I'm not an irrational or paranoid person...but the fog. Something about it, I can't describe the type of fear it gave me; it was almost like something primal. My legs carried me away from the door, down the hall, and into my room. Slamming the door shut, I stood there, back against the door.  The fear that sat in the back of my head spread like a disease, my frontal lobe, down into my neck and into my chest, crawling to my arms, hands, legs, feet. 

I needed to talk to someone, anyone, I didn't care who. I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't spooked. I'm missing an event or meeting or something and I'm just being dumb. There is always a rational explanation for everything, and this was no exception. I went to my bedside and reached for my phone that was still on the charger. 100%, thank God. 

I selected the first person I saw on my contact list, Abby.  

Ring....Ring......Ring......Ring......Ring......At the 10^(th) ring I was disconnected... I tried Mia, Sarah, my mom, dad, grandparents, aunts, uncles, even high school friends I haven't talked to in years. They all disconnected at the 10^(th) ring. I went back out in the hall, I called the Ra office, Campus security even 911. Still at the10^(th) ring, it disconnected. 

I made my way back to my room and locked the door. What the fuck is happening, I feel so odd right now, usually I write my feelings down and it helps...but this is different, I don't feel safe. I know I need to leave but. Where would I go? Isn't it better to wait stuff out? I just don't want to make a mistake. 

My room is set up with mine and Abby's bed on opposite sides of the room, the same as our desks. The door was right next to her bed while the window was right next to mine, usually I had the shades drawn halfway. It was completely covered. Was someone in my room? 

Everything is freaking me out right now, I'm just being silly, I'm just dumb, I'm fine, I will be fine. Like always, I'm paranoid, no one was in my room, people are here...just somewhere. 

It has been 3 hours since I locked myself in my room. The Wi-Fi doesn't work nor does my data, my laptop is missing and so is Abby's. I've been laying on the floor, reading, doodling to pass time but I'm still antsy, I want to be calm, cool, collected, but I am none of those things at this moment, it is still silent...why is it so silent? 

 

**6 hours**. 

 Still nothing. I summoned enough courage to go out in the suite area; the room was dark but warm. I can't believe the sun has gone down already. There's another window at the end of the hall next to Mias door, usually the daylight blinded me as I walked out to greet the day but much to my surprise it was also completely covered. so so odd. It doesn't make me feel any less creeped out, but I knew I would feel better having the lights on at the moment, I rushed over to the light switch, practically punching it. 

 The door to the suite looks out into the hallway, in this hall there are suites down both sides, so the doors face each other. Obviously, I overlooked this boring detail and paid it no attention, but it did give me a heart attack looking and seeing my face in the neighbor's door ,i kno  

Holy shit someone just banged on the ceiling above me, I'm so fucking stupid, this building has three floors, and I never thought to check the others?! I'm going to do it, the stairs are just at the end of the hall, I've been acting so crazy, I know someone's here, God dammit i really do hate my mind.  God I'm so silly. I can't wait to tell the girls later. 

 

 

I'm being punished...I must be. I must have done something. I'm dead, I must be, maybe I died in my sleep, and this is a test?  A limbo maybe? Hell? Disgusting, I still have drool and vomit all over me, I smell like piss, and the worst part is, I'm right back where I started. 

 

It's been **11 hours** 

 I'm in my suite on...I don't know what floor or where I really am or what the fuck is going on. I managed to reach the end of my hallway, walking into the stairwell. The heavy metal door slammed behind me, scaring the shit out of me. When you don't talk or hear anything for hours on end, normal things tend to be deafening. 

I begin my ascent, my footsteps echoing off the concrete walls; I got to the second landing. 

I went to open the door, but it was locked. How does an emergency exit lock? Isn't that some fire hazard or whatever?  

It doesn't matter, I began to climb to the third floor, I got to the third landing, looked up, no door. How. 

 How does a door disappear?  

All the air escaped my lungs as I looked up. I gazed in awe at the endless spiral of metal staircases that laid before me. Stretching into a dark abyss, I held onto the railing trying to catch the air that escaped me... looking down...the first floor was gone, replaced by the spiral. 

 I became dizzy and slammed into the wall behind me. I was shaking, crying, the snot and tears dripped down my face. I'm in hell. I must be 

It felt like hours, I was in a trance like state, staring off into the nothingness that was before me..then.... Then there was a groan. 

Not like a person, like an injured animal, one that wasn't killed with the first shot and was begging for mercy at deaths hand. I struggled getting up off the ground and slowly peaked over the ledge. Something was walking up the stairs. Rising out of the black mist so effortlessly, I swear it was floating. 

The sound. Groaning got louder as the...thing ascended. It sounded..gushy, its footsteps were sticky, the sound of liquid dripping and sloshing reverberated off the wall and sent echoes into my mind and soul.  

I was frozen...it made its way to the bottom on the stairs of what I assumed was the 2^(nd) landing. Its neck and head popped with a wet crackling sound as its gaze met mine. 

Its hair, long and caked in blood, knotting and fusing to its head, its body was so..contorted. Like it was twisted around a pole, I could hear its joints cracking to sustain its balanced, skin was falling off on one side, exposing the muscles and tendons  

It's...fucking face... 

One side was crushed, exposing its brain matter and other disgusting anatomy periodically squirting blood onto the wall beside it...the “intact” side was like the texture of crack eggshells. 

It opened its fucking jaw, which was attached to the eggshell part but was a dangling grotesque mess in the other. Its tongue flicking upwards, spitting a mixture of unidentifiable liquid at its bloody feet. Its “breathing” sounded like its lungs were full of water, I couldn't tell if the popping sound was from the air bubbles escaping or if it was from its crushed trachea trying to fuse back together in this monsters disgusting “throat” 

Was it trying to scream? Begging me to help it, kill it maybe? Or maybe it was a warning of its barbaric and animalistic nature. 

It took a step forward; its exposed muscle and tendons shing in the dim stairwell lighting. Its feet sounded like wet laundry being slammed into the metal stairwell, echoing into my ears and making a home next to the sense of impending doom I felt in my skull. 

My body moved on its own, stepping backwards, and tripping up the metal stairs. It yelped as it stepped towards me; brain matter and blood drooping off the side and leaving a trail behind this freak.... Then it began to run. 

The smell of ammonia pulled me back into reality. I was scrambling to stand, like a fawn my legs were quivering as I hosted myself on the third landing, then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh. The sound of my footsteps mixed with the monsters' unrelenting screaming echoed as I went up. The smell of decay became overbearing. It burned. 

blurs flew past me as they flew down the middle of the staircase.  With the little breath I had I pleaded for help, something, someone, anyone, anything. I screamed to the abyss and all it answered with was the steady but fast paced footsteps of the thing hunting me. 

When I felt my own legs starting to give way, I saw it. The sight of a door was euphoric, illuminated by the red EXIT sign, I slammed my being into it, landing in the hallway. 

I was flash banged by the fluorescent lights, I picked myself up slamming into door to close it and running into the first suite I saw, locking the door behind me. 

I collapsed, heaving like a sick dog. I must have thrown up and passed out in my own puddle of vomit and tears. 

 

 I awoke, unsure if I was alive. Everything hurt and ached, a terrifying reminder that this was real...so so very real. 

Absent of all thought I laid on the cold tile floor, I began inspecting the cracks and frame of the door before me. my eyes wandered to the shoes rack, inspecting the white sneakers and green slippers on the rack 

The familiar sense of paranoia knocked on the back of the brain, waiting to be let in. 

I sat up and looked around. My eyes caught the door tags on each of the doors  

“ABBY”.. “DAISY”.. “SARAH”.. “MIA” 

I laughed. 

 Of course, obviously this is a dream. It has to be. I'm in some kind of deep REM sleep where I'm aware of the actions that take place, but it's all fictional. It's a horrible trick on my mind. I am not an irrational person. I'm not crazy. I've always been intact with my emotions. There's absolutely always a rational explanation for everything. 

At this point, I felt like I was babying myself. The only thing I could do to comfort me at this moment was to lie. Maybe it was true, maybe it wasn't. I was not so sure what was real anymore. As I lay there looking at the door tags that looked cemented into the wooden doors before me.

1phnumo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phnumo,"Après All Day, Zodiac Collection, and Plastic Baby Dolls","Pregaming for TBC since one of my NY’s resolutions is to *not* buy anymore from Bath & Body Works (anyone wanna hold each other accountable???)! Thankfully my favorite store had all the new releases.  

First off, **Après All Day**: This is not a bad smell, but it’s giving plastic baby dolls from my childhood. I sprayed it on the tester strip in store and kept going “WHAT DOES THIS REMIND ME OF?” Sprayed it on my wrist and it finally clicked on my drive home. Again, it’s not a bad smell at all, but if you want to smell like your favorite 90s or early 00s toy this is the spray for you!   

**Zodiac Collection**: I’m a Taurus and was planning on buying a bottle no matter what, but let me tell you I’m SO upset they missed the mark and didn’t assign Emerald Mist to **Taurus**. Taurus = mainly May = emerald (I’m totally kidding, there are actual problems in the world so I’m gonna stop complaining over a body mist!). Emerald Mist (**Aquarius**) is such a fresh clean scent, and as this was my first time smelling it, it was one of the new ones (to my nose) that stood out to me. Our beloved Bonfire Bash aka **Aries** smells the same (maybe a tad lighter than its predecessor), so I’ll be buying a bottle of this. Another one that stood out to me was Wrapped In Sunshine AKA **Gemini**; this was the one I was least interested in, but I’m going to give it another try. The only thing I’m not crazy about is the lingering orange fragrance. Whoever told me that Fresh Vanilla Blossoms aka **Virgo** smells like old lipstick really hit the mark with that one. And all I could get from Whipped Rose Latte aka **Capricorn** was rose; no coffee, no whipped foam, just a regular old rose. A lot of the remaining zodiac scents smelled very generic body mist to me (particularly Twilight Woods aka **Scorpio**).   

**Winter Mint** was good but did not stand out; it’s just another peppermint.  

Definitely not trying to yuck someone’s yum with these but this was my first impression. Interested to see what y’all think…👀",40,1765226873.0,bathandbodyworks,7,0.98,False
1phntps,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1phntps/family_protocol_responding_to_delusions/,FAMILY PROTOCOL: Responding to Delusions,"We're having a very tough time with my mother-in-law and delusions that she's been having recently. They have been disturbing to say the least and my father-in-law lacks the patience and empathy to deal with them most times.

I've been using Google Gemini to help create a step-by-step guide that all of the family members can follow when we are with her and she is either having a delusion, sun-downing, or confused.

Let me know your thoughts on the below protocol and what you would add, change, take away, etc. Feel free to steal it too!





\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 **FAMILY PROTOCOL: Responding to Delusions**

🎯 **Our Goal**

The goal is **not** to correct the false belief, but to **validate the distress** and **gently redirect** her attention to restore her calm and sense of safety. Arguing or correcting only increases her anxiety.

🧠 **The 3 R's: Delusion Response Strategy**

This simple, sequential method helps manage difficult delusions or fixations by focusing on your mother-in-law's feelings, not the false facts.

**1. Recognize (The Feeling)** 👂

When she expresses the fixation, your first job is to **validate the emotion** she is feeling, not the content of the delusion. Don't argue, correct, or get defensive. Arguing makes her feel disbelieved, increasing her distress and agitation.

• **Focus on the distress:** Identify the emotion—fear, confusion, or upset.

**2. Reassure (The Safety)** 🛡️

Once you have validated her feeling, briefly offer comfort and assurance of her **present safety**. Your tone must be calm and loving.

• **Confirm current safety:** State simply that she is safe now.

🗣️⚠️ **Use these lines to acknowledge her distress and calm her down.**

1. ""That sounds **very upsetting** to think about. I am so sorry you feel so scared.""
2. ""I know that feels real to you, but I want you to know you are **completely safe** right now.""
3. ""I'm here with you. We'll make sure everything is okay.""
4. ""I promise you, you are perfectly **safe right now.**""
5. ""It is peaceful now, and everything is fine.""

**3. Redirect (The Attention)** ➡️

After the brief reassurance, **immediately change the subject, activity, or environment**. This breaks the thought loop before the delusion can escalate. Do not dwell on the topic.

• **Change the focus:** Shift her attention to something pleasant, familiar, or tangible (like a hobby, a snack, or a photo album).

🗣️⚠️ **Use these lines to immediately change her focus once you've acknowledged her distress.**

1. ""Come with me, let's go \[sit by the window/get a drink of water\]."" (Uses movement)
2. ""I'd love your help with something. Can you tell me your favorite song to put on right now?"" (Uses a pleasant choice/distraction)
3. ""You look cold. Let me get you a cozy blanket and we can look at this beautiful book."" (Uses comfort and a tangible object)
4. ""I just smelled coffee brewing! Do you want to come have a cup with me?"" (Uses a familiar sensory trigger)
5. ""Let's forget about that right now. Tell me about your garden from when you were a child."" (Uses a simple, distant, happy memory)
6. ""Wait, before you tell me more, can you remind me where you put the \[keys/glasses/remote\]?"" (Uses a gentle, immediate task)

🌙 **Nighttime Protocol (Where Delusions Worsen)**

• **Lighting:** Ensure good, soft nightlights in the bedroom and hallways. **Eliminate dark shadows** that can be misinterpreted.

• **Routine:** Maintain a strict, calm, and consistent bedtime routine.

• **Stimulation:** Avoid late-night TV or intense conversations before bed.

❤️ **Personal Wellness Guidance**

• **Self-Protection:** Please remember the words and belief are the disease, not Mom.

• **Stepping Back:** If you are the subject of the delusion, it is okay and necessary to **excuse yourself** and let another family member handle the Redirection. Do not try to defend yourself or argue.",1,1765226818.0,dementia,0,1.0,False
1phntg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/1phntg8/how_likely_it_is_that_i_broke_my_machine_already/,"How likely it is, that I broke my machine already...? (stupid manufacturer not giving instructions)","So long story short - tired of manual espresso machine being too inconsistent and wanting to JUST DRINK COFFEE, I have bought a Philips LatteGo EP2334 automatic espresso machine. Yeah, I know, it's not ""real coffee"" or something, anyway.

In the box there was a ""manual"" - a 8 page set of black-and-white pictures, showing how to perform first run, and a picture of spinning dial to change grind size. It has ceramic burr grinder I might add.

So from factory it was set to the middle setting. I tried my first coffee, was a bit too watered down, so I changed to minimum setting (or minimum +1). Second coffee was marginally better.

Then I have found on the internet, on some random website (not even on Philips website) a full, WRITTEN 600 page manual. In which it states clearly:

>You can only adjust the grind settings when the machine is grinding coffee beans.

And:

>Do not turn the grind setting knob more than one notch at a time to prevent damage to the grinder.

And also:

>achine has been set up to get the best taste out of your coffee beans. Therefore we advise you not to adjust the grind setting until you have brewed 100-150 cups

Yeah, would be REALLY NICE OF THEM to include these warnings on the manual that was IN THE BOX. Prefferably, next to the BIG PICTURE SHOWING HOW TO ADJUST THE GRIND SETTINGS.

Of course, I changed 5 steps at a time, while the machine was not grinding. Used to how I did it with my manual titanium burr grinder. After I have read the instructions I have adjusted it during the grinding back to the middle position, but because the dial is spring-loaded, it's impossible to do this one step at a time, so I changed again 5 steps coarser, this time during the grinding.

So the question is - how likely it is, that I might have damaged the burrs? Is it just a scare tactic, or do these claim hold any water? I'm using a good quality, very lightly roasted beans from local roast shop, so the beans are pretty soft. Maybe there's an easy way to verify if the grinder is okay?

Thank you for any advice you can give me.",1,1765226802.0,Appliances,1,0.67,False

2nd) Gain 7 rerolls and a duplicator now, Gain this again at 6-1.  
3rd) 10% Dmg Amp, 18% against Opponents with same Traits

Started with a 2\* Kogmaw with great items ( RB+GS) off the rip and win-streaked through stage 2. 4g from the first augment and econ start allowed me hit 50g quickly and I was lvl6 on Krugs.

Stage 3 went smoothly, winning and losing a couple but maintaining great econ. Leveled to 8 on creep round and used the 7 free rolls from my stage 3-2 augment to hit Belveth, Rift herald, and Kaisa.

Stage 4 wasn't very eventful, was never under much pressure but I also didn't highroll 2\* anything. Decided to get to 9 before doing any heavy rolling and went to 9 after stage 4 carousel and slow rolled above 40g for 2 stars. At this point I held on to my duplicator, planning to angle for 3\* Kaisa. Was saving to go lvl 10.

Early Stage 5, all the sudden 2 people died and I was spiked 30g from my first augment and immediately I was at 114g. Went to 10 immediately and slow rolled above 50g. I still had about 60 life at this point so I planned to slow roll above 50 for a couple rounds before sending it.

I still had both my duplicators at this point, and found the 7th Baron at 6-4 when both me and the Shurima player had one life left. I had 7 Kaisa also so if I didn't hit Baron I was going to use on her.",1,1765226480.0,TeamfightTactics,2,1.0,False

Just stands there, coffee mug in hand, staring at nothing. I thought maybe she was watching birds or meditating or some shit, but then I realised her eyes don't move. She just stares, perfectly still, for exactly four minutes. Then she blinks three times fast, like someone hitting a reset button, and goes about making breakfast.

>Last Tuesday she told me about her sister's wedding. Saturday, the pharmacist told me about his sister's wedding. Same story. Same details about the flowers. Same pause before the punchline. Same laugh. Word. For. Fucking. Word.

Her hand just... froze. Hung there in the air for a solid thirty seconds while people walked around her. Then she blinked, grabbed the box, kept shopping. Nobody else seemed to notice.

**What I'm looking for:**

We're both Adjusters. Maybe your character still believes that we're helping people. Maybe mine's starting to crack. Maybe we both are and we're just cracking in different directions. I want the moral complexity, the horror of realising you're the bad guy in someone else's story. 

**Novella literate:** I write 500-800+ words per reply (if I'm being honest often more), sometimes more when the scene's got its hooks in me. Multiple paragraphs, and I like detail to a point that I know a lot of people don’t. The internal monologue, the environmental details, the way a character's picking at their thumbnail while they're lying, all of it. I'm not asking you to match that word-for-word, but I need a partner who won't see a long post and think ""oh god"" instead of ""oh good."" 

**Long term worldbuilding** that we develop together because I want a partner in this. What's the company's real endgame? How far does the network spread? What happens to a person after they've been adjusted a hundred times? A thousand?

**Slow burn relationships** (romantic, platonic, antagonistic, I genuinely don't care as long as it earns itself). Characters with complications and contradictions. People who don't have easy answers because easy answers are for people who haven't looked in the mirror lately.

**I'm 21+,** you should be too. This is going into dark psychological places - surveillance, loss of autonomy, the death of self. **Third person past tense** is my preference and how I’ll write (I wrote the above just for the vibe) but I'm flexible for how you want to write. Expect a few solid replies a week. However, please note I am NOT heavy into smut and this is not an ad for an ERP, at all. 

**I’m open to discussing the platform**. It needs to have a web-based option because I do all my writing on a standard keyboard, not on my phone. 

If you don’t mind, in **your first message**: Tell me about the moment your character realises things might be messed up. The specific assignment, the thing they see, the moment where all the little weird things snap into focus and they start to question what they're really part of. Not in some vague ""oh no the system is bad"" way, I want the specific thing, the detail that hits them.",1,1765226337.0,AdvLiterateRP,0,1.0,False
1phnk7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1phnk7q/how_to_react_to_my_grandmother_shutting_me_out/,How to react to my grandmother shutting me out?,"I (25 f) have a very close bond with my family. Every sunday (in the past every day for just afternoon tea) we come together at my grandparents house and enjoy coffee, cake, a drink and finally soup around lunch hour. This has been this way my entire life. My grandmother is a real matriarch who runs everything and likes everything to be perfect. 

Now, I'm not saying she is a bad person. She has always broughts gifts, done everything and she loves us very much. But she has also always been very strict with me specifically. I had to be silent in social gatherings, and not in the way. Im the oldest daughter of her son. But to my younger sisters she was never this strict. 

It should be noted that every gathering, I do most of the catering and all of the dishes for more than 14 people. I have been doing this since my 12th year. I do not mind. But.

Now i have a reoccurring issue with her. Ever since i was a little girl, ive been wanting to sit in the living room with the adults. Ofcourse as a child, i was supposed to stay with the other children in the kitchen so back then this was normal. 

But she still does this to me. Every big holiday, think of christmas, newyears, sinterklaas (dutch holiday), etc. At some point she claims that the room is too busy, then she points to me and tells me to sit at the kidstable. My aunt and father, her children have tried telling her how unreasonable this is. Especially since my younger brother stays in the room while I, being 6 years older than him, get sent away. But she doesnt listen. 

It isnt that im vain. I wouldnt mind if it wasnt just me. Its just that in the past ive been excluded in school by bullies alot and despite the fact that i have grown past those memories, her sending me in the back brings back that same deep feeling of fear. Its so intense that it brings tears to my eyes despite me being a very calm person. 

Ive tried telling her this, ive tried being mad or refusing but it doesnt work. I know that if i storm out during such an occasion only paints me as the wrong one. I cannot endure. Ive tried telling my therapist but she told me stuff i already knew or tried. How do i deal with this in a way that doesnt leave me looking like a petty child? How do i solve this in the best way?

We’re in Florida and they are snow birds and come down south for the winter time. We got a really big townhouse to share however it’s not big enough to get away from the narcissistic abuse. Now that I’m remarried and my husband moved in here it’s so much more uncomfortable their rude behavior when someone is here in the situation who is not used to living in a narcissistic/ golden child/ black sheep dynamic. My husband is always uncomfortable and I’m just so used to it being around it my entire life I go into gray rock mode like it’s my other personality. However it’s now harder for me to accept this toxic environment with him pointing everything out and how much they absolutely abuse me and how depressed I am around them. For example just today I was eating lunch in the living room by myself listening to Xmas music. My mother and brother came home from shopping. Only about 10 minutes later he asked what she wanted to watch on tv, turns off my music playing and then turns on the tv without ever asking me anything. Like I wasn’t even in the room. This is common behavior like I don’t exist. Or my mother will be cooking an elaborate breakfast in the morning eggs, bacon, pancakes etc. I’ll come downstairs and she’s like oh you want some? Sure I go to make coffee ☕️ Then my brother comes downstairs she gives him my plate of food. I come back to get it… oh there’s no more food left?! wtf 😳??? I don’t even try or ask anymore I just make my own food but if I ever bring leftovers from going out to dinner with my husband or friends, they will eat it without asking me. It’s just gone. I mean this is just a few examples but the list goes on and on. It’s so frustrating…. I pay all the bills in the house yet it’s like we’re an inconvenience to them and we’re kicked out of our own home for 6 months of the year. It’s just getting worse every year.

His sister is 23, broke up with her boyfriend that she has been with for a few years. Zero savings, they were living together and now has nowhere to stay. She can’t stay with his parents because they live elsewhere and she needs to be able to go to work. 

They say she is saving up for a deposit to move out, why does she have zero savings you ask? Because she is irresponsible with money to the point their parents don’t want to lend her the money so now it’s becoming our problem.

I didn’t mind at first, she kept herself to herself and would do a lot of baking. No amount of fresh homemade cinnamon rolls can make her overextended stay less annoying.

She showers and leaves the shower in such a state, long hair strands everywhere. Twice our shower drain was left clogged. Every morning between 5 and 6 she blow dries her hair and it sounds like an airplane taking off. 

Since she’s been here our grocery spending has gone up to £550 a month when it was usually under £300. The idea is she doesn’t spend as much money because she is “saving” but she still has time to go out multiple times a week. 

She also doesn’t clean up after herself. Coffee mugs, meals at random times and leaving plates. If you ask her she says she’ll pick it up later and usually later is several days. 

He spoke to her once and she began crying and apologising. She is going to stay with his parents for Christmas but she will be back after because she has no money yet to rent her own place.

**Part 1:**

So, let me just start off by saying that I’m not a believer in the supernatural. Not even a skeptic, and I won’t be convinced that what has been happening to me is caused by some entity. Despite that, I must admit that I have no idea how I could possibly explain the events of the past few weeks.

I guess I should just start at the beginning. If I remember correctly, I may mix up some things, my memory has been kinda shit lately, the first time something weird happened in my apartment was about three weeks ago.

The morning started off normally. I got up, showered, dressed, drank my morning coffee and then drove to work. At work I didn’t really do anything (I never do, I work in the IT department of a pharmaceutical company and my job is mainly just to explain basic computer program functions to my coworkers and every now and then do actual work that is IT related, but I’m getting side-tracked.), except hang out with my work buddy, well, to be honest, he’s my only real buddy right now, Flynn. So, as I said, normal, boring workday.

But once I got home, the weird shit started. It wasn’t anything big, but after entering my kitchen and opening my liquor cabinet, I found that my wine stood on the left. To be fair, the cabinet was small and only really had enough space for one bottle per column, but the bottle was snug against the left wall of the cabinet. I could swear to god, that I always placed it slightly to the right, but at the time, I just thought: “Who cares, I guess I put it in there.” I proceeded to take the wine out of the cabinet, pour myself a glass and then sitting down in the living room to watch, I don’t even know what I watched, but I watched some show and ordered pizza.

The rest of the day was completely uneventful. The same goes for the next couple days. But then, three or four days later, when I was just getting ready to get comfortable for a weekend filled with energy drinks, some wine probably, Anime and League Of Legends with Flynn.

As I sat down and booted up my pc, I, again, noticed something that seemed strange. The power button of my pc was, this is gonna sound stupid, I know, but hear me out, it was on the wrong side. At least, my muscle memory told me so. Of course, I didn’t consciously keep track of the button, so it didn’t look weird to me, but when I subconsciously tried to pressed the button when sitting down, I just pressed against the metal casing.

It felt weird, but again, how the hell would a power button randomly switch places on my computer’s casing. After a while, I concluded that the button must be on that side on my work computer and that I just got it mixed up in my subconscious.

After that, I just started my PC and basically immediately went into a discord call with Flynn.

“Hey dude, are you ready to climb to emerald this weekend?” he asked me immediately. I just scoffed a bit. We have been trying to reach emerald for a month now, without any success, but hey, maybe this weekend would be different. “Yea, whatever. Let’s just get a few warm-up games in, I haven’t played for like, three days I think.” I said, as I was opening LoL. “What about the games we played yesterday?”, “Oh, you’re right, my bad. Okay, then let’s hop into ranked straight up.” I guess I tried to repress the memories of the five game losing streak we achieved the day before, but anyway.

We then played a few matches that actually went pretty well. I think we played for about six hours or so, before we decided to call it a day.

“Man, I hope we have the same luck tomorrow.” Flynn was always so optimistic. I was sure that tomorrow we wouldn’t have that much luck, since live never really gives you something good, without throwing you into a pile of shit right afterwards.

“Yea, me too” I answered him anyway. “Well, see you tomorrow Flynn.”, “See ya.”

That was that. It was nice, having someone like Flynn. We weren’t super close, but it was always fun gaming with him.

I got up and went into the bathroom, where, before I could use the toilet, I just randomly passed out, I guess. Whatever, wasn’t the first time this had happened. But what happened when I woke up was very unusual. I woke up to a loud banging sound, like the bathroom door being slammed shut, and a stinging, burning pain in my neck. I slowly got up and felt my neck, where I immediately felt blood. Not much, but very noticeable nonetheless. I tried to look at it in the mirror and it looked like scratches. Fuck, did I really scratch myself when I passed out? I was so confused by the scratches that I didn’t even thing about hearing the door slamming shut. I only remembered it after I cleaned up my wounds a bit and went to leave the bathroom.

As I tried to exit, I froze. “What the fuck? That- Wasn’t that…?” I muttered to myself. The wine and the power button I could write off as nothing, but now, I was 100% sure that something was wrong. My bathroom door was moved about 25 cm (9.8 inch) to the left, so that it ended right at the corner of the room.

I noticed how dizzy I felt and I don’t know if it was from fainting or from something else, but I wanted to get out. I hastily went to open the door but fumbled it and smashed my hand into the door, causing me to let out a small yell of pain. I then took a deep breath, opened the door and quickly went into the kitchen, where I wanted to drink a glass of water, or five, but then instead decided to drink a glass of wine instead. It would help to calm me down better.

So I did that, opened my kitchen window and stuck my head out of it, catching some fresh air. It was just then that I realised that it was the middle of the night.

After a few minutes, I retracted my head back inside and closed the window again. I looked across the hall to the bathroom and realised that the door was back to it’s normal place. I guessed I must’ve hallucinated it when I was still drowsy from passing out. After that, I went straight to bed and fell asleep while watching some lore video about a shooter called ‘ready or stop’ or something, I don’t remember.

When I woke up the next morning, I had mostly forgotten about the bathroom incident, since I wrote it off anyway. But as I stepped out of my bedroom, I immediately remembered again. The bathroom door was shifted to it’s wrong place again.

**Part 1 End.**

**Part 2:**

You know, I’ve been thinking a lot about what has been happening lately, trying to find reasonable explanations for all of this. I mean, I haven’t even told you about the really weird stuff that has happened to me in the two weeks after the bathroom incident. But anyway, as I already said, I’m not gonna accept a paranormal explanation for this, there has to be something else that’s going on. The most obvious answer would be that I’m just going crazy, but I swear I’m not. I’ve been crazy before, kind of. I was checked into a mental hospital for three times now due to mental health issues, which I don’t want to further go into. What I’m saying is, I am aware of my mental state and I. AM. SANE.

The only other possibility that comes to my mind doesn’t really satisfy me either, since it’s really bordering on the paranormal, but I would still call it a ‘scientific’ explanation. I think that my apartment may be, somehow, connected to another version of itself. Parallel dimensions, connected through a wormhole.

But it took me a while to reach this possible conclusion, so let me tell you what else I experienced leading up to this.

First of all, my bathroom door kept switching positions, I got used to it after a few days. The wine bottle and the power button also remained in their switched position. Only the bathroom door wasn’t static. Most of the time, it was when I got home from work, that the door was normal. But after a few minutes it always went back to it’s weird position. I never saw it happen, but it always did.

It took a while until something new happened. Well, something new that is worth mentioning. There are probably a lot of minor things that happened that I just don’t recall. Anyway, one day, I was just grabbing myself some wine, the bottle was of course, in a different position that I had left it in, but whatever. After I had my glass of wine, or better said three glasses, or even four, I don’t remember exactly how many it was, but I was still feeling fine, I swear. Well, after that, I got up and basically immediately fainted again. When I woke up, I was in my living room. Weird, but my memory before passing out was blurry anyway, so maybe I stumbled into here before fainting. But what happened next made me realise that I was most likely moved.

There were voices. Not even faint, they were clear and they were coming from all around me. I thought my head was gonna explode, they were so loud. I had to get out of there. As I ran for my apartment door, I realised that even though I was hearing the voices clearly and they were speaking in what sounded like English, I didn’t understand a word they were saying. Was I having a stroke?

I busted open my apartment door and made my way into the hallway. I slumped down against the wall and closed my eyes, taking deep breathes, as the voices started to quiet down, until I couldn’t hear them any more. It must’ve been at least a few minutes before I heard another voice. But this time, I understood it. “Mr. Pitt, are you alright? You look sick, what are you doing out here in the hall anyway at this hour?” It was my neighbour, her name was Clara White if I remembered correctly. “I… I was just feeling kind of dizzy and wanted to grab some fresh air and I guess I was feeling worse than I thought, since I kind of, well, since I kind of collapsed here.” I shrugged slightly. Not the worst lie I could’ve come up with. Thinking about that interaction now, what was she doing out there? It really was late. Maybe she was was going for a late night jog or something.

Anyway, she made sure that I was safe to return to my apartment, I thanked her and then went to bed instantly. At this point, you’re probably wondering why I was still staying in my apartment with all of this happening. And to be honest, I don’t know. Somehow, I didn’t realise how fucked up my situation was, I guess. If I’m being completely honest, it still doesn’t feel all that strange. I guess I get used to stuff pretty quickly?

Well, it was weird enough to me, that I decided to talk to Flynn about it the next day. Well, kind of talk about it at least. I’m not completely stupid, so of course I thought that maybe, since I work for a pharmaceutical company, there were some leaks of some chemicals that were somehow leaking into the IT offices. When I woke up, first thing in the morning, I called Flynn. “God dammit, why the hell are you calling me this early?” “What do you mean, you have to get to work at the same time I do?” “Whatever, just spit it out” I swallowed a bit, thinking about how I could talk around what I was experiencing. “Well, I was just wondering if you’ve been feeling, I guess kind of strange lately?” “Huh, what do you mean?” I sighed. I didn’t even know what I meant myself, without sounding like I was crazy, but I would try. “I don’t know, just kind of dizzy a lot and stuff?” “No, not really, why? Is everything okay with you?” Fuck. So it wasn’t some chemicals in the office. At least I could rule that out. “Yea, I’m fine. I guess I should just drink less energy drinks or something. Anyway, see you at work.”

With that, I hung up. Kind of rude, I know, but I needed to think. While I got done with my morning routine that day, I came up with the wormhole/parallel dimension stuff I already mentioned. Since then I felt somewhat at ease about the shifting of my things and the occasional voices, but I wasn’t completely satisfied. But it was the only thing that I could come up with that was at least halfway logical. Well, it’s still the only explanation I can come up with.

As I said, there wasn’t anything new in the past few days, but there was something that I was looking forward to. For the upcoming weekend, I planned to visit my brother, who lived in another town. If I’m being really honest, I almost felt ecstatic at the thought of getting out of this apartment for at least a few days. And luckily, that didn’t change when the weekend finally came. I went to my brother’s place and actually nothing weird happened there. This just solidified my theories that whatever was happening was connected to my apartment though.

On my last day at my brother’s place, he suddenly looked at me with a serious expression and asked: “How have you been doing? I was worried before you showed up here, is something wrong with your phone?” I blinked at him, my eyes filled with confusion. “Well, I called you like fifteen times and you didn’t answer or return any of them.” “What, I never got any calls” I pulled out my phone with a puzzled expression and opened my call history. He was right. Fifteen missed calls. “What the fuck?” I muttered. After a few seconds I looked up at him again and gave him a small, faked smile. “I guess there is something wrong with my phone, I’ll check it out” “Okay” he answered but seemed like there was still something bugging me. “Just… you know that if there is anything going on, if you ever feel like you need to talk to someone, I’m always here for you, you understand that?” The look he gave me broke my heart a little. I know that he meant it. He always meant it when he said that, still, I always shut him out. I’m an asshole excuse for a brother sometimes, I know. I just hugged him tightly and tried my best not to cry.

I knew he’d always have my back, but if I told him what was happening to me, he would think that I was having a mental episode again and he wouldn’t really believe me. So I swallowed my tears and the urge to tell him everything. God, I wanted to tell someone so badly. Usually, I always keep to myself, but this time, I wanted to not be alone with it, but I knew that I couldn’t share this. So I broke away from our hug, gave him another fake smile and said: “Thank you”

I didn’t stay at his place for much longer. I packed my things again, said goodbye and left, back to my apartment. I didn’t want to go back, but I had to. That day, when I returned and opened my apartment door, I didn’t notice anything weird. Actually, nothing weird was happening for two hours or so. But what then happened was, well, it wasn’t like the other things. When I was on my way to the kitchen, I passed the hallway mirror and stopped. I looked into it, stared into, trying to figure out what it was that felt weird about what I was seeing. Then it hit me.

I wasn’t seeing my face in the mirror, I was seeing the back of my head. “What the actual fuck is this” I was mostly annoyed, that my apartment, or the wormhole, whatever, had found another way to mess with me. Then, my mirror image turned to face me, but it’s face was… It was wrong. I don’t know how I could describe it accurately, but everything in my face was just twisted. My reflection grinned at me with this completely fucked up grin, that still fucks with me every time I’m dreaming. Then, it seemed to jump out of the mirror. I don’t know if something hit me or not, but the last thing I remember is blood gushing out of my nose and eyes, before I passed out again.

**End of Part 2.**

**Part 3:**

I awoke to a worried Looking Flynn shaking me as I laid in my hallway. “Fuck, finally dude. You’re awake.” Flynn looked as if I’d just come back from the dead. “I just passed out I guess. And I also-” But I froze mid-sentence. The blood. I bled from my nose and my eyes before I passed out. I was sure that that’s what happened, right? I must’ve imagined it, since there was not blood on me now.

I then realised that Flynn was still there, waiting for me to continue my sentence. “Actually, nothing. I just passed out. How did you get in here anyway?” I looked at him a bit confused. I had completely forgotten that he was supposed to come over in the first place. We wanted to watch all of the Star Wars movies. The good ones at least.

“Well, I still have your emergency key. Remember, you gave it to me when your cat was still alive, so that I could come over and feed him when you were away. You never asked for it back and until now, I never remembered I even had it.” He shrugged, before then helping me stand up again. I was a bit wobbly on my feet. “You really scared me dude. I thought you were dead for a second. Maybe you REALLY should drink less energy drinks. They seem to really fuck with your blood circulation.”

I twitched slightly at his mention of blood, but I don’t think he noticed. God, I swear there was so much blood. Maybe something happened to another version of me in a parallel dimension? Okay, now I even sounded crazy to myself.

“Yea, probably. Anyway, it’s good that you got here I guess. It’s nice to know that even if I were in a more critical condition, someone would’ve been there to help.” This was way out of character for me, to say something like this. But him mentioning my dead cat made me realise how few people I had left that really cared for me. I only really had Flynn, when taking my family out of the equation. Even then, my brother was the only one I regularly had contact with. It’s not like I had a bad relationship with my parents, but we just didn’t keep up as much.

Anyway, Flynn looked at me a bit weird, before reverting back to his normal demeanour. “So, are you still up for that Star Wars marathon, or…?” I laughed a bit at that. I have just shown this man more emotions than I’ve probably had shown him in the past few years we’ve known each other and he still just thinks about watching Star Wars with me. But I kinda liked that about him. It was always really easy to feel at ease around him.

I just nodded and signaled for him to take a seat on my couch. As he turned on my TV and the first movie started to play, I went to the kitchen to get us some drinks and snacks. I actually just chose water for myself this time. For the first time in a while, actually. Anyway, I got him something else to drink, I don’t remember what, but it doesn’t matter, and with the snacks, I returned to the living room.

Once I sat back down and started to watch the movie, I started to wonder if anything weird would happen. Actually, I was really hoping that something would happen, so that I finally wouldn’t have to be alone with this anymore. But for the first trilogy, nothing happened. And by this time, I gave up on it. If after basically 6 hours nothing had happened, nothing probably will happen.

Before we continued with the prequels, we took a little break. For Flynn that meant going out for a smoke, and for me that meant going to the bathroom to splash myself with some cold water, so that I’ll be able to stay awake for at least a bit longer. God, I wanted to just down one or two energy drinks, but I really didn’t want to fuck with my blood circulation any more, so I just kept to splashing my face with the cold water.

After three or four splashes, I was feeling at least a bit less sleepy. I looked into the bathroom mirror and there it was again. The fucking back of my head. As soon as I saw it, the voices also started to blast in my ears again, louder than they ever had before. I looked to the bathroom door, wanting to get out as quick as possible, but the door, well, it wasn’t just displaced like it normally was, it was rapidly dashing from one corner to the other, rushing from the left of the wall to the right. In my desperation I tried to catch it when it was in the middle, but instead of bursting through the door, I just smashed into the wall, stumbling back. I definitely hit my head against the wall, and it must’ve been pretty hard, because I’ve never felt so fucking dizzy in my entire life.

I felt blood rushing down my head as I turned it to look for something to help me get out of what was starting to become an active nightmare, as the voices grew louder. “SHUT THE FUCK UP!” I yelled at the top of my lungs. I felt like I was going deaf, insane and dying all at the same time. “Leave me alone, please…” I pleaded as I sunk to my knees. I looked around the room and it was then that I noticed two or three blood-stained towels just lying in my bathtub. But I was to busy trying to somehow withstand the voices to think about the towels, since I could now clearly hear what the voices were saying. They were telling me to end it. “Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself!” Blasting through my brain, over and over again, without any pause.

And god, I really wanted to. I wanted to end it all right there, just so that the deafening sound of the voices would stop. By now, not just the door, but basically everything in the bathroom was spinning through the room at insane speeds. They were so fast that they started to blur together, forming a face. It was the face that I had seen in the hallway mirror, before passing out. That horrifying, twisted version of my own face, just grinning at me. I couldn’t even look away, since my eyes just refused to close.

At that point, taking my own life felt like the only option I had left. Slowly, I looked away from the face, staring at the sink, which was the only thing that was still normal in the bathroom. Well, the sink, and the razor-blade laying on it’s edge.

I slowly extended my quivering fingers towards the blade. I picked it up and brought it to my wrist. My whole body was trembling now.

Just as I was about to cut into my own skin, I saw something else flash before my eyes. I saw my brother, and me. I saw myself hugging my brother, before I left him to go back here.

“Fuck you” I said with a now determined voice, as I looked up, straight into the grimace that was my own twisted face.

“Fuck YOU!” I shouted at the face, before throwing the razor-blade straight at it. And then, suddenly, everything was back to normal. No more voices, no more shifting objects. Just my normal bathroom and a razor-blade, that was now lying on the floor. My mind was still racing, trying to comprehend what just happened.

After a few seconds, I shook out of my frozen state and looked in the mirror. I looked normal, except that my head was still bleeding. No, that blood definitely rushed out of my nose and eyes, I didn’t imagine that. I then looked back to the bathtub, and the bloody towels were still inside.

“What the hell is going on here…” Then, the bathroom door opened and there was Flynn. He stared at me, as if he were surprised to see me. He quickly composed himself though. “Oh, d-dude, is everything okay? I… I heard screaming?” I looked at him for a while, not knowing what to make of it. Something was weird about him. Did he clean the blood off of me? But why would he do that and then pretend like nothing happened? “I just hit my head, that’s all” I told me and then turned away from him to grab myself some bandages. Just as I turned, I could’ve sworn that I saw his expression change, like he didn’t like my answer, like he was angry, or even furious. I didn’t have enough time to turn back and take a better look though, because as soon was my back was turned to him, I felt something hit my head and everything began to fade to black as I lost consciousness.

Recently I've been curious (as I drink one of these everyday and always just grab a ""plastic"" straw provided) about the safety of these Green Plastic Straws that Starbucks provides in most places in the United States.

  
I know when I'm in certain places traveling for work in CA they provide paper straws, but I'm talking about these Green ones that say ""BPI Certified Straw"" on the paper. 

I've been looking online for more safety info regarding these but my searches always come up short.

  
I'm worried about how many microplastics I'm getting with my morning coffee everyday over these past years.

  
These straws always seem chipped with fibers on either side of the hole. Have you all noticed that as well? Nevertheless, I still use them for some reason. 

  
Thanks all! And thanks to all the great baristas at my local Starbucks, I always go out of my way to make it to my favorite ones in different cities, some locations are much better than others when the All-Star baristas are cooking! ",0,1765226070.0,starbucks,2,0.33,False

1phnh1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1phnh1l/i_think_i_hypnotized_my_son_please_help/,I think I hypnotized my son. Please help.,"It was his 10th birthday, so my wife and I wanted to do something special for him. We invited his entire 4th grade class to a party in our church’s youth building (not my idea - my wife is very involved with our church, and apparently the pastor’s wife brought it up after a meeting). I didn’t realize the turnout we would have - it seemed like his whole school showed up. All things considered, it was a fun time filled with balloons, games, pizza, and cake. 

However, an hour into the screaming and rampage that is the 10 year-old experience, I felt a migraine coming on. Searching desperately for relief, my wife saved me with a great idea to give me a break. A movie on the projector in the mini-sanctuary. With hope of silence on the way, I went into the tech room and dug through the stacks of movie discs lining a small shelf where I found my son’s favorite - *Jurassic Park*.

I peeked out of the room to gesture to my wife to cull them all into the room for a movie. I wasn’t quite fast enough to close the door before the playful screams rang my head like a bell once again. A minute later my wife walked into the room and told me they were all set. Luckily the room was dark and sound-proof, allowing my wife and I to pull up a show for ourselves to watch while we sat on a comfy couch. 

“You ok baby?” my wife asked, massaging my neck and handing me ibuprofen. I shook my head which shot a jolt of pain through my skull, and finally took the meds. I drifted off at some point, waking to my wife gently tapping my chest and telling me the movie probably ended. She offered to go get them but I could see that she was now developing a headache too, so I sacrificed myself to the blinding fluorescent light. When I opened the door, I heard a rhythmic beating noise that was identical to the sound a laser tattoo removal machine makes (don't ask how I know - lets just say parenthood made me realize how immature a peach and eggplant... salad... looks on my arm). Strangely though, the noise did not seem to increase or decrease in volume the closer I got to the sanctuary door. 

It was then that I saw the scene which still flashes in my mind with every burst of pain in my skull. I swung the door open to find all of them as still as the dead, locked onto the stage. It was dark, but I swear I caught a glimpse of a man on the screen - or maybe he was standing on the stage - wearing a mask as pale as a sheet. All at once, every kid snapped their blank gazes to my eyes, mouths open in silent screams. I flipped the lights on and the man was gone, but the children continued to stare with emotionless eyes, now with smiles that slowly faded in unison. I said something to the effect of, “Uh… are y’all ok?” Silence. “Who was that on the stage?” Again, silence. “Well the party’s over. Parents will be coming soon so let’s head out.” After a long pause filled only by a chill running down my spine and a clap of pain in my head, the children groggily stood up and walked out of the room. My wife came over and froze, tilting her head at their blank stares and dazed gait.

“You guys ok?” she asked to no response. Looking at me with concern, I shrugged and walked over to her. 

“I opened the door and they all just stared at me. It was kinda creepy. And I could’ve sworn that I saw someone on -” I cut myself off and ran to the tech room. As soon as I pressed the eject button, my vision went blurry with pain. I hadn’t realized when I put it in but the CD was blank, no “Jurassic Park,” no dinosaur, just a white surface. I put it back into the *Jurassic Park* box and took it with me. 

The kids never came out of their hypnotic trance, even after being picked up. I asked question after question to my son but never got a response about what they saw. After cleaning up, we hopped in our car and drove home. My wife had a look of worry - and maybe rage - etched onto her face, mine reflecting the same. We stopped at a gas station to pick up more ibuprofen for my headache and offered our son that he can pick anything he wants. Instead of the usual gummy worms or Coke, he turned to me and with no inflection in his voice said, “I want to go to Carcosa to see the twin suns.”

“What? What are you talking about?” I asked as another wave of pain flooded my head - the sight of the children staring at me in the sanctuary filling my mind. “What is Carcosa?” I asked to no response. “Did you see it during the movie?” Again, nothing. 

Once we got home my wife pulled me into the bedroom and whispered in panic questions about what happened. I barely heard her over the pounding in my head, spliced with visuals of the man in the mask. “I don’t know. I am just as confused as you,” I said sharply. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to snap at you. It’s just this headache.”

“I know. Believe me, I know,” she said, holding the bridge of her nose with a pinched grip, looking for relief from her own pain. 

“I’m gonna check out the movie I put on. I think there is something wrong with it.” I said, pulling out the disc. 

“Well before that, let’s have him open his presents.” she said with an unexpected urgency. I agreed and walked out to see our son standing in the middle of the kitchen, looking straight ahead out of our sliding glass door. I followed his gaze but saw nothing outside. 

“Hey, kiddo, do you want to open all these presents?” I asked in the most cheerful voice I could muster. He simply scanned over the bags and boxes that made him giddy with excitement just hours ago. 

“No,” he said with disinterest and turned to me, “when are we going to Carcosa?” he asked with a glint of hope in his eyes. 

“Um,” I paused, wanting to hold onto any semblance of my once bright and cheerful boy. “How about we figure that out right after we open some presents!” He proceeded to pick up a box, move it around aimlessly, then put it back down. I could only watch, filled with dread as I heard the sound of my wife crying in fear behind me. 

Eventually, after they had both gone to bed, I put the disk in an old CD player that I dug up from storage while wondering if this was some kind of hypnosis, could I stop it from getting me too? My heart was pounding and my hand was trembling as I reached for the play button. However, there was only a black screen. No beating rhythm. No man in a mask. I swear I pressed every button on that remote but nothing happened. I couldn’t sleep. I don’t think any of us did. 

My alarm clock went off, signaling it was time to get ready for church. The morning was uneventful, my sweet wife made breakfast and coffee, but none of us touched a thing. Before we even got to the front door, the pastor’s wife speed walked over to me.

“Hi there, I hope you had fun yesterday!” she said with a grin.

“Well we -” 

“Could I have that back, please,” she suddenly cut in. Her happy look was unmoving, unflinching, like a mask. Zap. Another blast of a headache, another flash of the children's gaze. 

“Oh yes,” my wife stepped in, “it looks like we accidentally put the movie in a bag while we were cleaning up.” She said as she handed it over. 

“Did you like it?” she asked our son gleefully with a wink to my wife. 

“I loved it!” he responded with more energy than I had seen since the movie. I was astonished and turned to my wife who looked more concerned than surprised. 

“This is not what we had agree-” my wife began to say harshly to her before she ran off to another family to greet. 

“Wait, what?” I asked her. “Did you know something?” 

“No,” she said firmly, “I didn’t know...” And with that we rushed off to make it in time for service. During the sermon, I noticed our pastor never said the words “God,” ""Jesus,"" or “Lord,” only “King.” Each time he did my head would pound and my mind would flash with their blank eyes, their wide mouths, their smiles, the mask. However, I saw my son, eyes alight with passion, listening intently to every word and figured I should stay for him. He was paying attention in church and he finally didn’t have such a flat affect. 

Afterwards, I noticed my son and a few kids from the party seemed to be upset about service ending. I caught two of them glance over at me then start excitedly talking to each other before, bam! Another punch of pain, another vision of the mask.

My wife kept her head down, almost looking guilty. Before we left, a woman walked up to to us with her child who began chatting with my son. I couldn’t make out their words - they were talking so fast it seemed like they were just passionately spewing consonants in a mutter. I tried to listen more intently but was shut out with one more pang in my skull and a flash of this kid’s screaming face. 

“... so anyways at the - oh my goodness! Are you alright?” the woman asked me, noticing me flinch. “Did you not get enough sleep?”

“Yeah, I’m fine. Just a bad night,” I responded. 

She spoke almost as fast as our boys. “Oh, well you should take some medication. Do you have any ibuprofen? You should always carry around some. I have a baggie of them if you’d like.” 

“Thank you for offering, I took some already,” I said.

“Well anyways, my son here seemed to have gotten sick at the party. He came home looking miserable. But don’t worry! He has never been more excited about today’s service. And it looks like your boy enjoyed it too.” I simply nodded with a grimace and began to leave. 

“Make sure you bring it!” my son called back to the boy with joy, “it will happen soon!” 

“What will happen soon?” I asked my son after getting into the car and shifting into reverse. 

“The play.”

Pop. Another burst of pain accompanied by that damn mask. “A play? Are you going to join the school play?” Or at least I think I asked him. Maybe I never got the words out before the crash. 

Once I woke up, the nurse told me that my wife told them what happened. I went limp at the wheel, screaming with pain, my eyes wide with a blank expression before crashing into a parked car. The nurses and doctors told me I was lucky to be alive.

Yeah, lucky. Lucky to be cooped up in this bed, almost completely paralyzed, unable to speak in more than a garbled mess of words. Not from the crash, that only gave me a little bruise on my cheek - everyone else was fine too. No, I was lucky that I had gone to the ER where they found mass brain tissue calcification - at least that's what they are calling it. They said that my symptoms point to a brain aneurysm, but the hardening of tissue is like nothing they have ever seen. Portions of my brain are denser than they should be, and for some reason it's changing shape entirely.

They showed me my MRI so I could see it for myself. No one mentioned it, but I saw it plain as day. It resembled a fetus or some human-like shape, white regions gathered to form a skeleton-like structure. 

Well apparently, I should count myself lucky because the kids are going to put on a show for me. The nurse told me that my wife and son will be here soon with some of his friends and all sorts of props from the church.

Please leave ideas about what may have happened at the party. Do you think he'll be alright now?

I’ll finish this after their little play to see how he's doing now. He really is a good kid.

1phnesz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phnesz,Large beech dining table,"Hi folks. Wanted to share a dining table I made for my parents which I'm pretty happy with. I previously submitted it asking for help as the base was racking. Many thanks for everyone's help and advice. In the end, every tweak to strengthen it felt like a design compromise which I wasn't willing to make and so I remade the base, beefing up everything which in retrospect now feels more proportionate for the size of table (1.2m x 2.4m). It is much stronger now. The old base have been shortened both in height and length to make a coffee table base for my brother and so they are not being wasted. 

The table itself is made from spalted beech. I bought about 20 - 30 slabs being a mix of beech, oak and others at auction of a distressed hardwood dealer a year or two back and have been itching to make something with them. Joinery is dominos and finish is lacquer (morrells 440). I've made a tonne of mistakes along the way and the table is far from perfect but I'm happy with the result. 

If I had to do it again, I'd sub out the finishing. That is tough to do well and the weather was not on my side (had to spray in the garden).

I’m planning an 8-day trip to Vietnam (Feb 27–Mar 7, 2026) for my parents (early 50s) + 2 adults. We’re aiming for a relaxed, scenic, low-walking itinerary and wanted to check if this plan makes sense or needs edits.

Anything I should swap/remove based on March weather and crowd? Your suggestions would be super helpful

Plan so far:

* Day 1–3: Hanoi — Old Quarter, West Lake café, Temple of Literature, Water Puppet Show
* Day 3: Ninh Bình day trip — Trang An + Bai Dinh (buggy), skipping Mua Cave steps
* Day 4–5: Ha Long Bay — 1-night 4★ cruise (quiet/non-party)
* Day 5 night: Fly to Da Nang
* Day 6: Ba Na Hills — Golden Bridge + cable cars
* Day 7: Hội An — Lantern evening + river boat
* Day 8: Easy Da Nang day — beach/cafés/Dragon Bridge
* Day 9: Fly out from Da Nang

  
Alternative I could get

* Hanoi: Old Quarter stay. Electric Buggy tour instead of walking in traffic. Coffee at Train Street.
* Hoi An: 2 nights. Flying into Da Nang, private car to Hoi An. Sampan boat ride. 
* Ba Na Hills: Taking the cable car from *Hoi An Station* directly to the Golden Bridge to avoid the steep climb from the lower gardens.
* Da Nang: Marble Mountains (using the Glass Elevator only). Dragon Bridge fire show.
* Halong Bay: Overnight cruise (La Casta or Peony). 
* Ninh Binh: Day trip. Trang An Boat Tour (Route 2 - mostly sitting/scenic)

I have since deleted it but I'll put the text below. It's long. I have an update, because shortly after that post, I reached out to her to apologize for our last argument, which ended up with us reconciling (she sent me a long weepy message about how I showed her what it meant to truly love, and that she was forever grateful, and said in another world maybe we could be together. I asked her if we could give it another shot and before you know it, we were back in). She ended things with me 3 weeks ago again. Anyway, here's the old post, and then my update:
—————————————-

Discarded after 6 months, and feeling shattered

I want to start this off by saying I'm not really sure she has BPD, but I've had a couple different people mention to me that that's what it sounded like to them when I recounted our somewhat brief relationship. I've heard of it in the past and even read about it and watched some content, but for whatever reason I didn't really ever think about it in my relationship with her. For context, I'm 37 and she's 32.

We met on a dating app. She had an infectious positivity about her. We made out on our first date, and then hooked up in the middle of our second (she asked me to get something from the car and then made a move on me). From that point on, we moved very fast. On the third date, she told me that she was still friends with her ex, that they met about once a week and up until her and I met, they were sleeping together semi-regularly. She said it was 100% platonic and that she actually never really had much emotional attraction to him. He was a safe person for her and she ended up finally leaving when she realized she needed real romance and to really desire her partner. She felt bad about it but considered him a really close friend, and claimed that he was 100% in agreement that they were just friends and there was no future for them. This definitely raised my eyebrows - I assumed the guy was just maybe still in love with her and taking what he could get, and that she was naive for thinking the situation was ok for them. This arrangement had been going on for about a year.

I was actually talking to a couple other people at the time and thought that maybe I should take this as a sign to focus on them, but there was something about her that was so alluring. She was attractive, and the sex was pretty wild, but more than that I felt such a strong emotional connection. She ended up going back to her hometown for a couple weeks after our 3rd or 4th date, and I kind of assumed it might fizzle out, but she stayed in touch constantly. We'd send each other voice notes, she'd send nudes, we'd have hours long conversations. I was really starting to fall for her.

When she came back, we were inseparable. We decided to be exclusive. We started hanging out every single day. It was magical. Holiday markets. Short overnight trips. There were no boring moments. She seemed so interested in everything I loved, and she pulled me into her world too. She also seemed extremely dedicated to developing herself. She made a huge career change and was trying to start her own business. She had seemingly very strong ethics about how she interacted with the world. I later came to realize that she basically changed her entire life every few years, but that's another story. We were less than 2 months in but it felt like we were in love.

I learned about her incredibly abusive and chaotic upbringing. She was in fact still in touch with a family member that had abused her and her sister, and I always thought that was very bizarre. Her mother is also in a cult.

at around the 2 month mark, she asks me to be her boyfriend. Then not too long after that she says she loves me. I start to get a sense of some internal struggle at this point though. She starts saying things like she wanted to say that for a while, but she's not sure if she's ever really loved anyone. Sometimes she talks about having my babies and then sometimes she says she's not sure she can ever get married.

The next couple months are kind of a blur. We're still spending most of our time together. Still having a lot of sex. But there are some tense conversations around random things. We plan a trip to visit my family for a week though. It seems to go amazingly. My family loves her. We have a magical time visiting a big city together. There are a couple of weird moments where she seems to shut down a bit but then she's back to her normal self. After we get back from the trip, she writes an article on her substack about how in love with me she is, how magical the trip was, how everything was so perfect. We start talking about getting more serious. Ask each other things about marriage, children, houses, etc.

Little did I know, but this is when she starts reconnecting with people from her past, people she slept with or dated. A few weeks go by and she's starting little fights over tiny things. My anxiety starts rising. I realized she met with her ex bf to give him something without telling me, which was really weird. We told each other everything we were doing day to day. I brought this up in a small argument we were having, and she claims it meant nothing, they just got coffee. And the next day she sits me down with an extremely serious tone and says that bringing that up in a conversation about something else was out of bounds, and if i ever brought that up, or took out my jealousy issues on her again, that we would be over (I told her I got cheated on in my last relationship). I don't drop the argument, I start asking her more questions about it, and she reveals she's been talking to at least 3 other guys (on top of her ex) that she previously had some kind of romantic involvement with. One of them was a situationship that ended shortly before we dated (seemingly she wanted more, and he didn't). She said they ""only"" slept together 10-15 times and were just friends. She admits that he sent her a meme and then she asked him if he wanted to talk on the phone, and they talked for a few hours on a day she cancelled plans with me.

I don't know what happened, but next thing I know we are hooking up, telling each other we're sorry about everything, and we're gonna get back on track. She's going to block all these guys and focus on us. The next morning, I wake up and tell her I'm still not sure about things. I go to the bathroom and when I come back, she has her phone out and says I can read her messages, and if I want to end things, she understands. I read all of her messages with this guy. She completely underplayed how much they were messaging. Yes, he sent a meme a couple weeks earlier, but since then, they had been texting constantly. He even invited her to go on a trip out of state with her, which she thumbs up, but didn't respond otherwise. It was the last message, so she could have easily deleted that. I tell her that everything is fucked, I don't know if I can go on. She leaves, we don't talk all day, and then she sends me a long ass voice message about how shattered she is, she is an awful person. She's so sorry. She got scared that we were so serious, and all the little fights we had were here fault. She even projected jealousy onto me in the weeks leading up to this, accusing me of still being in touch with my ex which was 100% not true.

She wrote me a letter. In it she called it emotional infidelity. She said she did the same thing in her last relationship. Whenever she became unsure, she would start involving someone else. But she vowed that she was changing, she was going to close all the doors to her past and wanted to focus on me, focus on us. We already had another trip booked for the end of the month (April), and I confided all of this with one friend. He said it didn't look good, but I should just go on the trip anyway and feel it out. The next few weeks prior to the trip, she goes out of her way to be extremely loving. She apologizes constantly. She tells me all the time she wants my kids, she wants a life with me. She even made AI pictures of babies using pictures of us. Eventually, I stupidly let my guard fall. I don't know how it happens, but I basically gaslight myself into thinking that none of the cheating happened. I stop worrying if there was more, like if she actually met up with these guys. We go on the trip. Again it seems amazing. And then, the vibe shifts again when we return.

1 week later, we're having a dumb argument again. She's telling me she doesn't like that I get frustrated in traffic sometimes (not yelling or raging, just sighing or complaining in a soft voice). She tells me she needs someone who is further along in their emotional regulation. That she's been working with her life coach to be ""calm af"" which is apparently her life coach's motto and that she needs a partner who is on her level, and she's not sure about me. I start to lose it. I don't yell, or act threatening at all, but I say in a calm voice ""Well a month ago you were talking to 4 other guys behind my back to emotionally regulate, so don't be so condescending"". She looks at me with a completely dead expression, and says ""this is over"". I say what do you mean, and she says ""the relationship is over"". I'm in shock - I calmly grab my bag and leave. I haven't spoken to her since.

The first couple days I was just in a fog. I kind of thought I'd just get over it quickly. I was waking up from a bad dream, this person wasn't my person. She lied to me. But then, the doubt started building. I started thinking this was the best connection I've ever had. I've never been so excited to be with someone, to plan a future with someone. She could be so loving. She wrote me sooo many love notes. I literally got one in the mail the day after she ended things, written on a post card just a few days earlier. She printed pictures of us and put them in frames. She kissed me so passionately. She hugged me and held me and made me feel like I was enough. And then she ended things without explanation in the middle of a dumb fight. She blocked me on everything. I didn't try to reach out ever. I unfollowed her everywhere in the first week but just yesterday I impulsively checked her instagram and I saw I was blocked. It's now been a little over 2 weeks and I can barely sleep. I know deep down that this was too much for a 6 month relationship. If she's already cheating on me with multiple other men ~4 months in, that's a terrible sign. But my brain keeps contradicting itself. I blame myself for our last ever conversation going the way it went. For saying something so mean to her. I blame myself for not asking her to reconsider, and just leaving. I blame myself for not apologizing the day after. I wonder if she was already talking or seeing someone else. Part of it too is that I started to get a vibe like she was being shady that last weekend. She showed up really late to something with a bad excuse. But I have no idea. No proof of anything. All I have is complete silence and separation. Like nothing ever happened. We literally hung out nearly every single day for the last 5 months, and she threw me away like I was nothing.

Some days I feel a little OK. But most of the time I am thinking about her. Most of the time I am wondering if I'll ever feel that good again. And a lot of the time I hate myself for putting myself through all of that when there were such big red flags in the beginning.

I don't know... do you think BPD is a factor here? There's even more shit that I don't even know where or how to add (one of the guys she was talking to is diagnosed BPD and they had a really weird history. He's married and his wife hates her. He was telling her maybe she should try polyamory and that she should be with someone more on ""her level"" to be in a power couple). This is already so long though so I guess I'll leave it here. But she also discarded several other close friends even while we were together (one of them seemed particularly harsh - she wrote her an email telling her everything that was wrong with her and why they couldn't hang out, it seemed cruel to me at the time but I looked the other way).

How do I get over this? How do I stop hoping she'll come back and apologize for abandoning me like this, after I forgave her for fucking cheating on me?

—————————————-

UPDATE:

I'm going to try to keep this part shorter, maybe just a bulleted list:

- We start couple's counseling shortly after getting back together

- Almost immediately, there's another shady situation with a guy. She volunteered at this org that was trying to re-develop some land to promote natural beauty or whatever, and there was this hippy guy there that I could tell was into her. He sent her home with a flirtatious note in french one day, and when I asked her about it, she was just like ""oh he's just like that, he gave other people notes too"". She also told me he once said ""Can I give you a platonic compliment? I think you're really pretty""

- One day there's an event at this place, and I go. This guy is there. She pulls me aside and says ""I just need to let you know that when I borrowed your car the other day, I gave him a ride home because he asked"". We talked about it in therapy later that week, and she admits that he actually invited her in, introduced her to his roommate, and brought her into his room. I don't even remember why. She says that she slowly realized this guy was pushing boundaries, and she didn't tell me because she felt bad that I was right and she was wrong. The weird part of this, is this all happened in the end of July. After we broke up, I realized I hadn't even thought about this situation for 2-3 months.

- We get into this pattern where every few weeks, she kind of quietly freaks out about the relationship, and disconnects. She tells me that when this is happening, it's like she can't even access her feelings from me. Something I do or say scares her, and she shuts down.

- At one point, she has a massive trauma flashback to being abused as a child in front of me. After this, she asks me for a favor to sell some stuff her abuser gave her. This was about 3 months before the breakup. She tells me she wants me to do it before a date (right before the breakup), but doesn't want me to drag my feet on it and make her wonder if I am going to do it. I admittedly do drag my feet on it, as the task feels difficult, but I really did put it off and genuinely feel bad about it. In the end, I did give her the money for it right before the date she requested, but I didn't communicate it well

- In that 3 month period, the periods of high intense love (and planning for a future - family, moving in together) continue, but there's always a little tension and times where she disconnects. I get covid in October and am really sick for about 2 weeks. Towards the end of this period (she didn't have it so we weren't seeing each other much), she disconnects quite a bit, and starts comparing the level of ""support"" I give her to her new best friend (a woman and not someone she is romantically interested in). I tell her that I'm feeling unsupported because it feels like she's disconnecting because I am sick. There were other times where it felt like my ""weakness"" turned her off

- Shortly after I'm better, she goes on a trip to visit another couple (they were close friends before they moved a year ago). She seems distant, but we are still talking to each other a lot. Still being loving to each other.

- She comes back, it's her birthday. I write her a song and play it for her on my guitar. She cries. She puts the lyrics and chords on her fridge and sends the recording to her mom

- I go out of town for 2 days, then she meets up with that new best friend

- The next day, we are hanging out. She has a poetry reading event that I go to. Her new best friend is there and is giving me weird vibes. We go back to her place. We eat dinner. We make out with each other passionately. We watch a tv show on her couch while cuddling and I massage her. Then she breaks up with me over the task I mentioned earlier that I dragged my feet on. I ask if her decision is final, and try to defend myself. She's not budging. I leave. I am devastated. 2 days earlier, she venmo requested me $500 and bought tickets to go visit her family on Christmas. We were still just talking about moving in, etc. She says she's been disconnecting for 2-3 months, and that she was scared to be honest with me about it because of my emotional reactions and defensiveness, and cited a couple times I was a bit mean to her in tough conversations (no raised voices, and I immediately apologized once her feelings were hurt, but she never got over it. E.g. I told her she was using psychobabble once).

- Story isn't over. I see her one more time and get texts a few times. 3 days after the breakup, she lets herself into my apartment while I'm gone and takes an air purifier that I borrowed and leaves my key under a little bag on my front step. Texts me after she did it, not before

- i fucking run into her at the airport because her flight home for Thanksgiving (that I was supposed to be on) was literally one gate over from mine to visit my family. She asks me to come say hi. She is extremely hapy, carefree, and looks like she is floating on air. She reiterates the points she made in the breakup. She says she wishes I was coming with her, but in a way like it was my fault it wasn't happening. Hugs me while I am crying, and walks onto the plane.

- 5 days later, she texts me to tell me that i can still use the ticket on Christmas and it's not a problem for her (we were going to visit her family and my mom as they live near each other). So basically told me she was totally OK to take a flight with me on Christmas. I tell her no thanks, I'll figure something else out.

So I guess what I am trying to figure out from all of this, is WTF happened. was this a discard? Just a ""normal"" bad relationship. IF she was disconnecting for months, why did we still talk all the time (like even when I had covid, we talked on the phone for an hour+ a day, and texted a lot otherwise). Why did she have me buy that airline ticket? 2 days before breakup? Was it a sudden decision or was it something she was waiting to do for a while?

I guess on some level I thought things were ""improving"" because I wasn't aware of any deception on her end since the July situation. But now I'm left often feeling like this was all my fault. But sometimes feeling like it's so unfair that she is leaving me for the real mistake I made, even though I feel like I forgave her and gave her grace for a WAY worse behavior.

I don't know. I guess I am looking for advice on how to get over this, and if this really was a toxic, potential borderline (or maybe narc) situation. I'm not going to reach out. I do partly want to fully apologize for the thing she was upset about, but I know I can't do that now or maybe ever. And was I the toxic one? I don't know. I'm just so confused.

Somewhere east of Mendocino, 1979

The chickens don't know that the dream died. They still want their feed at seven, still peck at my boots when I'm slow with the scatter. I tell them they're capitalists now, same as everyone else. River looks up at me from the shade of the coop, tongue out, like she's in on the joke. Rain's off somewhere, probably chasing field mice she's never going to catch.

""You think it's funny, girl?"" I say to River. She thumps her tail twice in the dust.

The goat, Cosmo, stands on top of the old VW bus we were going to fix up and turn into a mobile kitchen. Rust has eaten through the engine compartment. Cosmo uses it as a throne now. I climb up, scratch between her horns, look out over what we built. A few shacks. A barn with a leaking roof. The garden where we grew tomatoes and zucchini until the well started running brackish three summers back.

Nobody else wanted the land.  We got it for a pittance.

""Paradise,"" I say. Cosmo chews something, probably one of my t-shirts she pulled off the line.

Sunflower Jack. That's what I go by. It's been so long I forgot what my folks called me back in Riverside. Something plain. Something that fit in a high school yearbook under a crew cut photo. That person's gone, dead. I killed him in 1967 when I drove up here with eight other beautiful souls who thought we could opt out. Build something pure. Something real.

Funny how real turns out.

I check the traps I set for rabbits. Empty, same as yesterday. Same as the day before. Started thinking maybe I should check the woods. But I don't like going into the woods much anymore. The trees feel different lately. Like they're watching. Like they're waiting for something.

River follows me to the main house, the only building with four solid walls and a wood stove. Rain comes trotting back from her adventure, mouth empty, pride intact.

""Catch anything?"" I ask her.

She pants at me. That's a no.

Inside, I fry up two eggs in butter going rancid, eat them standing at the sink. Used to be we'd all gather for breakfast, ten or twelve of us in here, passing around weak coffee and talking about the day's work, about the pigs we'd raise, the windmill we'd build when we got the money together. Someone always had a guitar. Someone always had a new idea about crop rotation or water collection or how to make our own soap. Good vibes, you know? Everyone contributing. Everyone part of the whole.

Now it's me and the dogs and the sound of my own chewing.

""They gave up,"" I tell River. She's curled up by the unlit wood stove. ""Can't blame them, I guess. Got tired of being poor. Got tired of being cold. Got tired of ideals that don't pay bills. The Man won, far as I can figure.""

Rain whines at the door. She needs out again already.

""You're worse than anyone,"" I mutter, letting her out. ""In and out, in and out.""

I spent the afternoon repairing fence posts the winter knocked over. Physical work keeps the thoughts quiet. Keeps me from thinking about the empty buildings. About the voices I sometimes hear at night that aren't the dogs or the goat. About the dreams that leave me shaking and sick come morning. The dogs wander the property line with me, noses down, doing their own investigations. They avoid the northeast corner, though. Always have, last few months. Won't go near that copse of pines where the ground's soft.

Smart dogs.

When the sun starts dropping, I feed everyone, check the water trough, lock the coop against foxes. The evening air smells like pine and dry grass and something else. Something sweet and rotten that drifts in from the tree line when the wind shifts. Dead animal, probably. Deer or coyote. Nothing to worry about.

Used to be we'd have a fire going by now in the pit out front. Someone playing harmonica. One of the women would dance barefoot in the dirt, spinning with her arms out, hair catching the firelight. Heavenly scene, man. Really heavy.

I stand where the fire pit used to be.

""We almost had it,"" I say to the dogs. ""We almost made it work.""

River licks my hand. Rain is already heading for the house, ready to sleep.

I light the kerosene lamp and pour myself a weak whiskey from a bottle I've been nursing for three months. It's almost cozy. I sit at the table we built from barn wood, and I try not to think about the quiet.

I drink and pet River's head and watch shadows move on the walls as the sun sinks lower.

""Going to be fine,"" I tell her. Tell myself. ""Going to be just fine.""

Rain's already asleep by the door. River's eyes are drooping. I should go to bed. Should try to sleep. But I sit there a while longer, listening to the sounds of nature, the wind through the distant pines.

I hope the trees don't start screaming again tonight.

I turn in, climb under the thick quilt.  River and Rain circle and lay in their favorite spots at the end of the bed. Sleep comes easy, but rest doesn’t.

The nightmares are back.

I can't breathe right. I can't think straight. The dream slips away before I can grab hold of it, but it leaves stains. Blood and screaming in my ears that's already fading. Faces I recognize but can't quite place.

I sit up in bed, sheets soaked with sweat, and River's whining at me from the floor. She knows something's off.

""It's cool, girl,"" I say. My voice sounds like gravel. ""Just a bad trip.""

But it wasn't a trip. Haven't touched anything stronger than whiskey in years. These dreams come on their own now.

I don't bother trying to sleep again. It never works. I pull on jeans and a flannel, stumble into the kitchen, and light the stove. The coffee's a year old, but I make it anyway. It tastes like boiled dirt. I sit at the table with my hands wrapped around the mug, watching the steam curl up toward the ceiling.

It's three a.m., maybe four. Time gets slippery out here.

I think about Candy Kane. She was the last one who really tried to make things work, you know? Kept the garden going even when the rest of us got lazy. She kept smiling, even when the winter of '77 nearly killed us. Young thing, maybe twenty, twenty-one? She had hair so blond it looked white in the sun. She wanted to be a dancer, talked about it all the time. San Francisco, she'd say. Going to dance in San Francisco. Make some bread, see the world, come back when she had her head together.

""You should go,"" I told her. Must have been March. Or maybe it was April. Hard to remember. ""Chase your dream, sister.""

Did she hug me? Did she say goodbye? I remember her smiling. Remember her saying something about missing this place. Then nothing. Just empty space where the rest should be.

I wonder if she made it. I wonder if she's dancing somewhere right now under stage lights, spinning the way she used to spin by the fire.

Then there was Hairy Terry. He was a skinny dude with a beard down to his belt and cracked glasses. His folks were getting old, he said. Needed someone to look after them. Couldn't keep living in the woods while they fell apart in some suburb in Sacramento. Made sense. Made total sense.

""You're doing the right thing, my man,"" I told him. ""Family's family.""

He promised he'd come back when things got settled. Bring his parents out, even. Show them what we built. Let them see that there was another way to live.

I believed him. I really did.

Except I can't remember him actually leaving. I can't picture him packing his stuff, loading up his rusted-out old Buick, driving away. Just remember talking to him one day, and then he was gone. Like he vanished. Like the earth swallowed him up.

And Big Pete. God, Big Pete. Huge guy, probably six-four, with hands like shovels. He just got bored. That's all. No big reason. No family emergency or career calling. He looked at me one morning over coffee and said, ""Jack, I think I'm done, you know? I need to see what else is out there.""

""I hear you, brother,"" I said. ""Can't stay in one place forever.""

""You could come with,"" he offered. ""Hit the road. See where we end up.""

But I couldn't leave. Someone had to stay. Someone had to keep the dream alive, even if it was just me and the animals and these falling-down buildings.

Did he leave? He must have left. They all left. That's what happened. That's what I remember.

They were the last three.  The ones who'd stayed the longest. I loved them.

The coffee's gone cold in my hands. I'm staring at nothing, at the dark window over the sink, trying to sort out what's real and what's a dream, when I hear it.

Faint at first. Like wind through branches. But it's not wind.

It's screaming.

My chest tightens. River's on her feet now, ears back, a low growl in her throat. Rain's awake too, pacing by the door.

The screaming gets louder. Not just one voice, hundreds. A chorus rising from the tree line, voices crying in agony, in regret, in endless suffering. They all blend together, high and low, men and women, and something that might not be human at all. 

""Stop,"" I whisper. Then louder. ""Stop it. Stop it.""

But it doesn't stop. It never stops when it starts.

I'm on my feet, hands over my ears, but it doesn't help. The sound gets inside anyway. Gets into my bones. The dogs are barking now, frantic, and I'm stumbling toward the bathroom because it's the smallest room, the darkest room, the room where maybe I can't hear it as much.

I collapse on the floor, back against the tub, hands pressed so hard against my ears that my jaw aches. Rocking. Can't help it. Just rocking back and forth while hundreds of voices scream and scream and scream from the forest.

""I'm sorry,"" I'm saying. Maybe out loud. Maybe just in my head. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.""

The screaming doesn't care.

It goes on until the sky starts turning gray outside the tiny bathroom window. Goes on until my throat's raw from sobbing. Goes on until there's nothing left of me but this shaking, broken thing on the bathroom floor.

Then it stops.

Just like that. Silence drops over everything.

I sit there. Breathing. Shaking. River noses the bathroom door open and licks my face. Rain whines from the hallway.

The sun's coming up. Another day on the commune. 

Another day in paradise.

The memories are coming back now in pieces. Fragments that cut.

I stand up slowly. My legs don't want to work right. River watches me from the doorway, head cocked, like she's trying to understand what I'm about to do.

""It's the blood,"" I tell her. My voice sounds hollow. Sounds like it's coming from somewhere far away. ""The trees are screaming because of the blood. I have to make it stop,” I say, as I stagger into the kitchen.

I lean against the kitchen wall and wipe the tears from my eyes. I know what I have to do, if I can find the strength. The whiskey bottle calls my name, and I pour the last drops down my throat.

The shovel is in the barn. The same one I used to dig the garden beds and the fire pit, and the graves.

River and Rain follow me across the property toward the northeast corner, but they stop at the edge of the pines. Won't come any closer.

They sit and watch as I walk into the trees.

It's cooler here. The pines grow close together, branches interlocking overhead, blocking out most of the light. The ground's covered in dead needles, and the smell is stronger. Sweet decay. Meat gone bad. The smell of things returning to earth.

I don't have to search for the spots. I know exactly where they are. Three graves under the same copse of trees, close enough that I could stand in the middle and touch all three with the shovel.

I start with Candy.

The ground's settled some, but it breaks easily under the blade. Soft earth. Good soil. I dig and dig and try not to think about what I'm doing. Try not to think about her smile or her dancing or the way she looked at me when I wrapped my hands around her throat. When I squeezed until she stopped struggling. Until she stopped asking why.

The smell hits me before I reach her. I gag, pull my shirt over my nose, and keep digging.

There she is.

What's left of her, anyway. The earth's been busy. Insects and decay and time did their work. I can still see blond hair, matted and dark. Can still see the flannel shirt she was wearing. The one I gave her because she was always cold.

""I'm sorry,"" I tell her. ""I'm so sorry, sunshine.""

But sorry doesn't fix anything.

Hairy Terry's right there, close enough that the graves almost touch. He fought more than Candy did. Actually tried to run. Made it maybe ten yards before I caught him. Before I hit him with the shovel. Before I did what I had to do to make him stay.

""Your parents don't need you,"" I told him while he bled out in the dirt. ""This place needs you. We need you.""

He didn't understand. Kept saying he had to go. Had to leave.

The glasses are still on his face somehow. His beard's gone mostly. Animals got to him.

I can't look at him long. Can't stand what I'm seeing.

Six feet to the right is the third grave. Big Pete's next to the other two. All three of them laid out in a row under the pines.

He was the hardest because of his size. Took three hours to dig a hole big enough. It took everything I had to drag him into it after I'd caved in his skull with the shovel.

""I can't let you leave,"" I told him after. After he'd stopped breathing. After his blood had soaked into the ground. ""If you leave, it's all over. It's all for nothing.""

He's in worse shape than Terry or Candy. Been in the ground the longest.

He was a huge man, full of muscle and hard work. Now there's nothing. No laugh. No life. Just bones in the dirt.

I stand there between the three open graves, the shovel hanging from my hand. The sun's moved across the sky. Must be past noon. I've been digging for hours, and my hands are bleeding, blisters broken open, dirt under my nails and in my lungs and in my soul.

The trees are quiet.

Just wind through branches and birds somewhere far off and the sound of my own breathing, ragged and harsh.

Maybe they never screamed at all. Maybe it was always just me, my mind breaking apart under the weight of what I've done, my guilt twisting into something I could hear. Something I could blame on the trees instead of on myself.

I don't know anymore.

Can't tell what's real and what's the rot inside me.

My knees give out, and I'm kneeling in the dirt between them. Between Candy and Terry, and Pete. Three people who just wanted to leave. Who just wanted to live their lives somewhere else. Do something else. Be something else.

And I killed them. Killed them because I couldn't stand to be alone. Couldn't stand to watch the dream die. Couldn't let go.

""I just wanted someone to stay,"" I sob. The words tear out of me. ""I just wanted someone to stay with me.""

River barks from outside the copse. Wants me to come back. Wants me to leave this place.

I stay in the dirt until the sun starts dropping. Until the shadows grow long and the air turns cold. Stay there until I can't feel my legs anymore. Until the only thing left is the weight of what I've done pressing down on my chest, crushing me into the ground with the people I buried.

For visa reasons I am currently back in my home country, where I met my boyfriend because I am applying for a visa from here. Before I lived for 2 months with him in our new flat. 

Back when we both lived here, we had a group of gay friends through my boyfriend. I never really had gay friends. One of the friends (from the same country as my boyfriend) and I got along really well. My boyfriend often invited him for a spontaneous dinner during the weeks and I always had a good conversation with him. After my boyfriend left, I met this guy two or three times, for coffee, dinner with another friend of mine and for going out. To me it always seemed clear that we both understood this relationship as platonic and to this day there have been no signs to the contrary. Now that I'm back I met him twice and since I am now spending some time in my hometown with my parents gone, I invited him for a weekend to show around. I don't expect anything sexual. 

Today my boyfriend express that he felt uneasy about this. He said I've shown bad judgement about other people's intentions in the past (true) and doesn't trust this friend. In the past, when I did misjudge someone else's intentions I always pulled back immediately. I offered to find an excuse and invite the friend, which would probably mean damaging a budding friendship that I value and I don't really wanna do that. My boyfriend says he can't and won't tell me what to do. 

What should I do? Uninvite and potentially the friendship to appease my boyfriend? Go through and maintain good communication throughout the visit? Am I being naive about thinking this can be a nice weekend without sex and romance? 

Background info: we're in a open relationship which worked well so far, we mostly live this out when going to sex-positive parties. We don't have concrete rules except to think of our partner and be honest when questioned. To me that also implies nothing with anyone my partner would feel uncomfortable with, which, regardless of my lack of intentions to the contrary, would also apply to this guy.

Every sound, every color, every motion on the street clawed at her senses until she felt flayed and alive by the simple act of stepping into daylight.

The yellow coat clung to her as if it were part of her body that was heavy, frayed and dragging with her limping leg.. She pulled it tighter, as if it could shield her from the blinding world, and forced herself down the corridor of the deposit. Each step echoed like judgment.

The card trembled in her hand. One beep, that sounded clinical and final, and the box unlocked with a mechanical sigh. Her gloved fingers closed around its contents.

Then she was back at home immediately, slamming the door shut behind her, and sealing out the light, the noise, and the chaos. One bolt, then another, as if each lock could keep her own thoughts from forcing their way in. The scarf came off, the blanket, and the endless layers of fabric she had wrapped around herself. She stripped them with urgency, as if her body might suffocate beneath the weight of protection.

In the hidden room, her hand found the ankle of Sue's skin which was delicate beneath the glove, and fragile as porcelain. Elisabeth dragged her into the open, into the unforgiving light of the window. Sue's body was limp, passive, an offering she both dreaded and demanded. Her head struck the hard floor on the way accompanied by a sound like a gunshot in Elisabeth's skull. She flinched but didn't stop.

Box 503 shattered in her hands. The note inside stared back at her with its cold apology:

*We are sorry you didn't appreciate your experience with The Substance.*

And beneath it, was the vial of black liquid. A word stamped across its glass: **TERMINATION.**

Her heart convulsed as she touched Sue's chest of the place where the needle would go. The syringe was suddenly immense in her hands like a promise and then she raised it above her with trembling hands.

*Are you sure?*

The voice wasn't in the room. It was inside her skull, coiling around her thoughts, digging sharp edges into her resolve.

*Once you stop, you can't go back.*

Her gaze fixed on Sue's chest that was still and peaceful, it felt so obscene. The temptation of that rhythm pulled at her, and mocked her.

*You will simply remain on your own.*

Her body shook. She tried to hold the syringe steady, but her vision blurred.

*JUST ON YOUR OWN…*

""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" she screamed, her voice a crack of thunder in the empty apartment.

*JUST ON YOUR OWN…*

The scream dissolved into action. She drove the needle down into Sue's chest. The plunger moved beneath her fingers, terribly pressing poison into the heart.

*Ba boom… ba boom… ba… boom…*

Each heartbeat stretched into eternity. And then, Elisabeth froze.

Her eyes locked on something beside the roses. The note card. Its words burned into her as if written in fire:

*THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE YOU.*

Her throat closed. The syringe slipped from her grip. Tears spilled fast, unstoppable, while streaking her face. She crumbled to the floor beside Sue, her body convulsing with sobs, the years of grief and rage erupting at once. She pressed her hands to her face but it couldn't dam the flood. The sound of her own pain filled the apartment.

And still, through the blur of her tears, the card remained visible with a condemning presence.

Elisabeth's hands shook as if they belonged to someone else, someone out of control.""I can't… I can't…"" Her voice fractured, breaking apart like brittle glass. The words scraped her throat raw. ""I hate myself… I need you.""

Her fingers clutched at Sue's shoulders, desperate, while trembling. She shook her with a fevered urgency that bordered on violence. ""I need you!""

Sue's body gave nothing back. No resistance. No breath. No warmth. Just stillness.

A sound like a child whimpering leaked from Elisabeth's chest as she bent close, her ear almost brushing Sue's lips, searching for the miracle of breath. She found nothing but silence.

Her heart raced, stuttering into panic. She pressed her mouth against Sue's, exhaling air with ragged rhythm, pounding her chest with both hands.""One… two… three… four…"" she counted, her voice cracking between each number. ""Forgive me. I was out of my mind… one… two… three… four…""

The confession slipped out before she could stop it. ""You're the only interesting part of me. You're the perfect one.""

And then came blood. A single line at first, then more, sliding out of Sue's nose in a red thread, thickening into a trickle. Elisabeth recoiled with a choked cry.

""No. No, no, no, no…""

She stumbled to her feet, nearly colliding with the doorframe, and bolted into the bathroom. Her fingers fumbled clumsily at the counter, knocking bottles over until she clutched the switch pipe. Clutching it to her chest, she raced back and dropped to her knees beside Sue, frantic.

""We have to get you ready…"" Her voice had taken on a manic brightness, like a performer preparing for stage. ""This is our big night!""

She hooked the pipe, forcing the mechanism into place, watching the blood circulate mechanically through Sue's veins, red surging where there had been none. But Sue's chest remained still.

Elisabeth screamed through clenched teeth. ""C'mon!!! They're gonna love you!!""

In fury, she yanked the needle from Sue's arm and, with a wild, decisive thrust, drove it straight into her chest. The scream tore itself from Elisabeth's body as she stabbed: ""C'MON!""

For a split second, nothing. Then came a sudden movement. Sue's rib cage heaved violently, like something trapped inside her body had just fought its way out. Blood erupted from her mouth, spattering Elisabeth's face in warm, copper-scented drops.

Elisabeth froze. Her body recoiled backward on instinct, stumbling, leaving her crouched in the corner of the room like a startled animal as her pulse thundered in her ears.

Sue's eyes were open.

So were hers.

The silence that followed was heavier than any scream.

Sue sat upright with a convulsion, her breath ragged with an unfocused gaze. She didn't seem to know who or what she was in that moment. Elisabeth's lips parted, but no words would come.

They stared at each other, not just looking, but *searching*. Each face was a mirror to the other's disbelief, their horror, and their longing.

Time stretched. A long, unbearable beat in which the world seemed suspended and weightless. Both women were activated, alive and raw, held together in a gaze that threatened to break them apart.

And then Sue's eyes flickered downward. The ""termination"" vial gleamed faintly against the floor.

A suspended beat.

The living room felt too small, and too close, as Sue lunged forward. Elisabeth barely dodged, heart slamming against her ribs, and scrambled deeper into the apartment. Something, anything as her hand snatched a glass ornament from the table and she hurled it back without aiming. It shattered against Sue's cheekbone with a sharp crack. Elisabeth didn't stop to see if it had hurt her; she stumbled, breath tearing in ragged gasps, and forced her legs to move.

*Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.* The word hammered inside her skull as she scrambled upright. Sue's footsteps thundered after her, relentless.

Elisabeth's fingers closed around the nearest object of a heavy trophy that glittered dully in the dim light. She swung with every ounce of fear in her body. But Sue ducked, quick as a predator, and wrenched the weapon free with violent ease. The sharp edge scraped Elisabeth's knuckles as it was torn from her hand.

And then Sue was on her.

A savage thrust to her gut knocked the air from Elisabeth's lungs; pain exploded through her chest as she careened backward, her body slamming into the framed poster behind her. The glass shuddered in its frame but did not break.

The fight was no longer human, it was raw and primal. Creator versus creature. Hunter versus hunted. Survival stripped of reason.

Sue's fingers locked around Elisabeth's throat as her nails dug into the skin gripping her with an unyielding force. Elisabeth gagged as her body convulsed, the edges of her vision blurring to gray. Her free hand clawed at the air, desperate, frantic, until it struck the cold base of the lamp on the side table.

She seized it, lifted it and Crushed it down.

The bulb burst with a violent crack, and a flash of electricity seared the air. Sue screamed, her body jerking as the current surged through her. The strangling grip loosened. Elisabeth staggered free, coughing, throat raw, vision swimming.

Then she ran.

The corridor tilted beneath her feet, her body heavy with terror. Behind her, Sue's footsteps pounded the floor, steady, relentless, like death itself.

Elisabeth threw herself into the bathroom and slammed the door, twisting the lock with shaking hands as her chest heaved, her lungs clawing for air.

On the other side, Sue's boot smashed against the wood. Once. Twice. Then the frame shuddered and the lock rattled.

The door wouldn't last.

Elisabeth's eyes darted around the cramped bathroom, desperate for something to shield herself. Her palms slid clumsily across the cold ceramic and she found a weapon, something she could use to protect herself as her pulse hammered so loudly in her ears that it drowned out every rational thought. The heavy oak cabinet seemed like her last hope; then she shoved her shoulder against it, straining to force it against the door.

But she was too late.

The door exploded inward with a deafening **crash**, splinters snapping through the air. Sue's silhouette filled the frame, a storm in human form. Elisabeth barely had time to gasp before Sue's fist connected with her jaw.

The impact flung her backward and her skull cracked against the corner of the earthenware sink, white sparks flaring across her vision. Pain radiated down her spine as her body collapsed to the floor with useless limbs, and her breath knocked from her lungs.

She tried to gather herself, clutching at the floorboards for balance, but Sue was already upon her. Fingers tangled in her hair, yanking her upright like a broken doll.

The mirror loomed before them as their reflections stared back, two women bound together in violence, eyes locked in something far older than the moment. For a fleeting second, Elisabeth thought she saw herself not as she was, but as Sue was: consumed, merciless, and monstrous.

Then Sue smashed her face into the glass.

The mirror cracked, spiderwebs of fracture running outward. Blood spilled hot and sticky from Elisabeth's brow. Her breath caught, but before she could find words, **BAM!** Another blow. Her face collided again with the mirror.

Her lips trembled, blood mixing with spit as she tried to form words.""Stop... we are o—""

**CRASH.** Another slam cut her plea short. Her mouth tore open further, words dissolving into meaningless sound.

Sue no longer resembled a woman at all, but a force of rage, blind and unrelenting. Her movements came in frenzied rhythm, a trance of destruction as Elisabeth tasted only blood and glass.

With a burst of instinct, Elisabeth wrenched herself free, staggering away from Sue's grip, running through the hallway to the living room.

She crawled, dragging her battered body forward. Her breath rattled in her chest, each inhale flecked with copper. The carpet burned against her raw skin as she inched toward escape.

Sue's shadow stretched across the walls, closing in. Then followed another impact. One final blow sent Elisabeth soaring, crashing into the coffee table. Glass erupted around her like a storm of knives.

She landed hard with a heaving chest as the shards bit into her flesh. She tried to rise, but her body betrayed her. Her arms trembled, and her legs refused to answer.

Sue stood over her, and the kicks began.

Each one jarred her spine, forced coughs of blood from her throat, painted the rug darker and darker. Elisabeth's body twisted under the punishment, every nerve screaming. But Sue's rage only grew, her movements mechanical, merciless, and animalistic.

Then came a sudden silence..

The pool beneath Elisabeth widened, spreading like ink, swallowing her. Her movements stilled. Her body slackened into unnatural silence, with the stillness of something that would not rise again.

Sue froze.

She looked down at the spreading blood as if hypnotized, her own chest heaving, and her pupils wide with terror. Slowly, as though waking from a dream, she realized what she had done.

And in that moment, the world seemed to wither.

A palm tree in the distance shed its leaves.

Everything was her. Everything was Elisabeth. And she had just killed it. She had killed herself.",2,1765225502.0,demonhatstories,0,1.0,False

Fell asleep Friday night on the couch watching tv, I had a lamp on beside the tv.

Around midnight I woke up with a weird vibe, like I just had a nightmare but couldn't quite remember it. I kinda shrugged it off and went to bed. I got up Saturday morning, made my coffee went to have a sip and realized the corner of my mouth had a small cut. At that moment I instantly remembered feeling the cut happen.

Sometime before I woke up, I became aware that I was laying on the couch, I could see the lamp light through my eyelids but I couldn't actually wake up, sleep paralysis. I felt a force trying to open my mouth and I was resisting clinching my teeth and forcing my lips closed. I couldn't open my eyes or move, my mouth was eventually forced open and that's the last thing I can remember.

It's now Monday and the cut is gone but the pain is still there, the right side of my face still hurts like after being at the dentist. My mental health has gotten worse and I feel confused and kind of detached.

For context I live on the top floor of a 4 story apartment building, definitely no carbon monoxide.

Maybe I was grinding my teeth and had sleep paralysis at the same time I dunno.",2,1765225345.0,AlienAbduction,0,1.0,False

I’ve gained a significant amount of weight over the past couple years (around 50-60 lbs). I know how it happened I stopped paying attention to what I ate and cut exercising- now I want to get back to my old habits of writing out what I eat and exercising a few times a week. Even once a week would be a big improvement. I’m vegetarian but want to increase my protein and track that especially. When I did personal training a while back they said I should aim for 150g of protein a day. I got some protein shakes each one is 30g of protein and 200 cals. I figure it takes up so many cals I should probably just have fruits, veges and salads after that. I want to cut sweets as I have a sweet tooth. Started my journey today- so far I’ve had two premade salads from local grocery store, three protein drinks and an iced coffee. I want to have another protein drink with some fruit later- I feel good and not hungry at all. What do you think of my plan? Goal is a fitness model type look which I know involves working out. It’s a bit tricky because I don’t have much room for at home workouts or the funds for a gym or exercise classes. But I do have access to an area I can use to workout when it’s not snowing and I already have my yoga mat there for when I’m ready. I struggle with fitness motivation which is weird because I used to be someone that automatically worked out with little effort. I don’t know if it’s harder for me because I gained weight now.

1phn3ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/BibleVerseCommentary/comments/1phn3ib/dr_heidegger_wasnt_a_christian/,Dr Heidegger wasn't a Christian,"
Prof Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher known for contributions to phenomenology, hermeneutics, and existentialism.

While he was baptized and raised Roman Catholic, and even studied for the priesthood in his youth, he explicitly distanced himself from Christianity as he developed his philosophical thought. In private conversations, he made his stance clear. For example, according to the testimony of his student and friend Heinrich Wiegand Petzet, Heidegger once [said](https://christoverall.com/article/concise/the-thorny-relationship-of-theology-and-philosophy-or-heidegger-and-a-christian-walk-into-a-coffee-shop/): ""Of course I do not trust in Christ. I am no Christian.”

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger):
>In April 1933, Heidegger was elected as rector at the University of Freiburg and has been widely criticized for his membership and support for the Nazi Party during his tenure. After World War II, he was dismissed from Freiburg and banned from teaching after denazification hearings at Freiburg. There has been controversy about the relationship between his philosophy and Nazism.

His interest in Christianity and religions in general was phenomenological: he sought to uncover how early Christians experienced their time, history, and existence, not to affirm the theological truth of their beliefs. For him, Jesus was not a salvific reality, but a historical figure around whom a radical form of lived experience emerged in early Christianity. He was interested in how the first Christians lived in light of Jesus’ proclamation and expected return, not in whether Jesus was the Son of God or rose from the dead.

1phn23e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1phn23e/i_think_i_accidentally_hypnotized_my_son_please/,I think I accidentally hypnotized my son. Please help.,"It was his 10th birthday, so my wife and I wanted to do something special for him. We invited his entire 4th grade class to a party in our church’s youth building (not my idea - my wife is very involved with our church, and apparently the pastor’s wife brought it up after a meeting). I didn’t realize the turnout we would have - it seemed like his whole school showed up. All things considered, it was a fun time filled with balloons, games, pizza, and cake. 

However, an hour into the screaming and rampage that is the 10 year-old experience, I felt a migraine coming on. Searching desperately for relief, my wife saved me with a great idea to give me a break. A movie on the projector in the mini-sanctuary. With hope of silence on the way, I went into the tech room and dug through the stacks of movie discs lining a small shelf where I found my son’s favorite - *Jurassic Park*.

I peeked out of the room to gesture to my wife to cull them all into the room for a movie. I wasn’t quite fast enough to close the door before the playful screams rang my head like a bell once again. A minute later my wife walked into the room and told me they were all set. Luckily the room was dark and sound-proof, allowing my wife and I to pull up a show for ourselves to watch while we sat on a comfy couch. 

“You ok baby?” my wife asked, massaging my neck and handing me ibuprofen. I shook my head which shot a jolt of pain through my skull, and finally took the meds. I drifted off at some point, waking to my wife gently tapping my chest and telling me the movie probably ended. She offered to go get them but I could see that she was now developing a headache too, so I sacrificed myself to the blinding fluorescent light. When I opened the door, I heard a rhythmic beating noise that was identical to the sound a laser tattoo removal machine makes (don't ask how I know - lets just say parenthood made me realize how immature a peach and eggplant... salad... looks on my arm). Strangely though, the noise did not seem to increase or decrease in volume the closer I got to the sanctuary door. 

It was then that I saw the scene which still flashes in my mind with every burst of pain in my skull. I swung the door open to find all of them as still as the dead, locked onto the stage. It was dark, but I swear I caught a glimpse of a man on the screen - or maybe he was standing on the stage - wearing a mask as pale as a sheet. All at once, every kid snapped their blank gazes to my eyes, mouths open in silent screams. I flipped the lights on and the man was gone, but the children continued to stare with emotionless eyes, now with smiles that slowly faded in unison. I said something to the effect of, “Uh… are y’all ok?” Silence. “Who was that on the stage?” Again, silence. “Well the party’s over. Parents will be coming soon so let’s head out.” After a long pause filled only by a chill running down my spine and a clap of pain in my head, the children groggily stood up and walked out of the room. My wife came over and froze, tilting her head at their blank stares and dazed gait.

“You guys ok?” she asked to no response. Looking at me with concern, I shrugged and walked over to her. 

“I opened the door and they all just stared at me. It was kinda creepy. And I could’ve sworn that I saw someone on -” I cut myself off and ran to the tech room. As soon as I pressed the eject button, my vision went blurry with pain. I hadn’t realized when I put it in but the CD was blank, no “Jurassic Park,” no dinosaur, just a white surface. I put it back into the *Jurassic Park* box and took it with me. 

The kids never came out of their hypnotic trance, even after being picked up. I asked question after question to my son but never got a response about what they saw. After cleaning up, we hopped in our car and drove home. My wife had a look of worry - and maybe rage - etched onto her face, mine reflecting the same. We stopped at a gas station to pick up more ibuprofen for my headache and offered our son that he can pick anything he wants. Instead of the usual gummy worms or Coke, he turned to me and with no inflection in his voice said, “I want to go to Carcosa to see the twin suns.”

“What? What are you talking about?” I asked as another wave of pain flooded my head - the sight of the children staring at me in the sanctuary filling my mind. “What is Carcosa?” I asked to no response. “Did you see it during the movie?” Again, nothing. 

Once we got home my wife pulled me into the bedroom and whispered in panic questions about what happened. I barely heard her over the pounding in my head, spliced with visuals of the man in the mask. “I don’t know. I am just as confused as you,” I said sharply. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to snap at you. It’s just this headache.”

“I know. Believe me, I know,” she said, holding the bridge of her nose with a pinched grip, looking for relief from her own pain. 

“I’m gonna check out the movie I put on. I think there is something wrong with it.” I said, pulling out the disc. 

“Well before that, let’s have him open his presents.” she said with an unexpected urgency. I agreed and walked out to see our son standing in the middle of the kitchen, looking straight ahead out of our sliding glass door. I followed his gaze but saw nothing outside. 

“Hey, kiddo, do you want to open all these presents?” I asked in the most cheerful voice I could muster. He simply scanned over the bags and boxes that made him giddy with excitement just hours ago. 

“No,” he said with disinterest and turned to me, “when are we going to Carcosa?” he asked with a glint of hope in his eyes. 

“Um,” I paused, wanting to hold onto any semblance of my once bright and cheerful boy. “How about we figure that out right after we open some presents!” He proceeded to pick up a box, move it around aimlessly, then put it back down. I could only watch, filled with dread as I heard the sound of my wife crying in fear behind me. 

Eventually, after they had both gone to bed, I put the disk in an old CD player that I dug up from storage while wondering if this was some kind of hypnosis, could I stop it from getting me too? My heart was pounding and my hand was trembling as I reached for the play button. However, there was only a black screen. No beating rhythm. No man in a mask. I swear I pressed every button on that remote but nothing happened. I couldn’t sleep. I don’t think any of us did. 

My alarm clock went off, signaling it was time to get ready for church. The morning was uneventful, my sweet wife made breakfast and coffee, but none of us touched a thing. Before we even got to the front door, the pastor’s wife speed walked over to me.

“Hi there, I hope you had fun yesterday!” she said with a grin.

“Well we -” 

“Could I have that back, please,” she suddenly cut in. Her happy look was unmoving, unflinching, like a mask. Zap. Another blast of a headache, another flash of the children's gaze. 

“Oh yes,” my wife stepped in, “it looks like we accidentally put the movie in a bag while we were cleaning up.” She said as she handed it over. 

“Did you like it?” she asked our son gleefully with a wink to my wife. 

“I loved it!” he responded with more energy than I had seen since the movie. I was astonished and turned to my wife who looked more concerned than surprised. 

“This is not what we had agree-” my wife began to say harshly to her before she ran off to another family to greet. 

“Wait, what?” I asked her. “Did you know something?” 

“No,” she said firmly, “I didn’t know...” And with that we rushed off to make it in time for service. During the sermon, I noticed our pastor never said the words “God,” ""Jesus,"" or “Lord,” only “King.” Each time he did my head would pound and my mind would flash with their blank eyes, their wide mouths, their smiles, the mask. However, I saw my son, eyes alight with passion, listening intently to every word and figured I should stay for him. He was paying attention in church and he finally didn’t have such a flat affect. 

Afterwards, I noticed my son and a few kids from the party seemed to be upset about service ending. I caught two of them glance over at me then start excitedly talking to each other before, bam! Another punch of pain, another vision of the mask. 

My wife kept her head down, almost looking guilty. Before we left, a woman walked up to to us with her child who began chatting with my son. I couldn’t make out their words - they were talking so fast it seemed like they were just passionately spewing consonants in a mutter. I tried to listen more intently but was shut out with one more pang in my skull and a flash of this kid’s screaming face. 

“... so anyways at the - oh my goodness! Are you alright?” the woman asked me, noticing me flinch. “Did you not get enough sleep?”

“Yeah, I’m fine. Just a bad night,” I responded. 

She spoke almost as fast as our boys. “Oh, well you should take some medication. Do you have any ibuprofen? You should always carry around some. I have a baggie of them if you’d like.” 

“Thank you for offering, I took some already,” I said.

“Well anyways, my son here seemed to have gotten sick at the party. He came home looking miserable. But don’t worry! He has never been more excited about today’s service. And it looks like your boy enjoyed it too.” I simply nodded with a grimace and began to leave. 

“Make sure you bring it!” my son called back to the boy with joy, “it will happen soon!” 

“What will happen soon?” I asked my son after getting into the car and shifting into reverse. 

“The play.”

Pop. Another burst of pain accompanied by that damn mask. “A play? Are you going to join the school play?” Or at least I think I asked him. Maybe I never got the words out before the crash. 

Once I woke up, the nurse told me that my wife told them what happened. I went limp at the wheel, screaming with pain, my eyes wide with a blank expression before crashing into a parked car. The nurses and doctors told me I was lucky to be alive.

Yeah, lucky. Lucky to be cooped up in this bed, almost completely paralyzed, unable to speak in more than a garbled mess of words. Not from the crash, that only gave me a little bruise on my cheek - everyone else was fine too. No, I was lucky that I had gone to the ER where they found mass brain tissue calcification - at least that's what they are calling it. They said that my symptoms point to a brain aneurysm, but the hardening of tissue is like nothing they have ever seen. Portions of my brain are denser than they should be, and for some reason it's changing shape entirely. 

They showed me my MRI so I could see it for myself. No one mentioned it, but I saw it plain as day. It resembled a fetus or some human-like shape, white regions gathered to form a skeleton-like structure. 

Well apparently, I should count myself lucky because the kids are going to put on a show for me. The nurse told me that my wife and son will be here soon with some of his friends and all sorts of props from the church.

Please leave ideas about what may have happened at the party. Do you think he'll be alright now?

I’ll finish this after their little play to see how he's doing now. He really is a good kid.

Health issues really finally helped me realize that I had to cut starchy grains and vegetables from my diet. Beans and rice would even make my glucose spike. But I found that completing my proteins with seeds (hemp, flax, pumpkin, sunflower) stopped the up and down spikes in my weight. So I now make a 1 lb pot of beans and I'm loving it. 

I'll make chana masala, lobia masala, various dals and even just a lentil loaf. It lasts me 4 days. 2 meals a day. 

Otherwise I have egg white burritos, air fried chicken or lean pork (meat only 3 days a week now!), arugula and shredded cabbage or other fiberous vegetable, carb balance tortillas, and occasionally some oats with protein powder, and coffee with oatmilk. That's it. Makes life easy in so many ways.

I don't make these dishes very ""authentic"". No ghee, imperfect spice blend, etc. I usually blend the onion and tomatoes to make a puree with the seed mix (HFPS) and add a bag of frozen kale or collards. I get a lot of needed nutrition in one dish and the variety has not made me tire of eating beans everyday and I'm 60 days in.

Really just sharing because I wish someone told me sooner. Skip the rice, add the beans and complete your proteins with seeds.

We are sitting at the gate at JFK, flight delayed.  There seems to be zero reason to not have beverage service… but before I become some entitled Ken, just curious if there may be good reason.

I’ll also say the flight attendants aren’t doing a bad job, but seem to be barely making the effort… it feels lazy and disconnected.  FWIW, I’ve had predominantly good to excellent experiences in my 8 months flying AA as my primary airline ",7,1765224978.0,americanairlines,36,0.89,False

&nbsp;

 
I'll be moving to NYC on Jan 17 from Seattle and am looking for a long-term sublet/lease starting Feb 1st. I'll be sub-letting my friends spot from Jan 17-Feb 1st in Williamsburg. I'd ideally like to stay within the Williamsburg/East Williamsburg area/Bed-Stuy area but am open to the Clinton Hill/Park Slope/Prospect Heights area! Space will need to be cat friendly as I will be bringing a cat with me. Also, looking only to have one other roommate, if possible. My budget is $2000, willing to push to $2250 if the space is legit. 

&nbsp;


About me: I'm a 34M who works as a product manager for a tech company. I like to workout, travel a lot, go to music festivals, play video games, and try new restaurants and cocktail bars. I prioritize keeping a clean and quiet apartment and hope to find a roommate who appreciates the same. 

&nbsp;


Let me know if you are interested. I am going to be in town from Dec 12-24 and I would love to grab coffee/check out the spot and see if we are good fit",1,1765224811.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False
